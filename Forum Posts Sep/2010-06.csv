6/1/2010,"i agree with this 100%, to much depends on pos's for them to still be as much a pain to use as they are. even ui tweaks, anchoring and online queue would be a step in the right direction."
6/1/2010,"this would be a great help, though i am in the camp that thinks the arrows should be proportional to the distance traveled in some period of time, rather than scaled with zoom. primary reason for this is that scaling it with zoom makes the length arbitrary (as zoom is arbitrary), and thus, arrow size becomes almost meaningless. the best compromise would be to allow the player to choose how many seconds of travel (aka scaling factor) that the arrows will represent. for the person that keeps the overview fairly zoomed out, choose a large scaling factor so they are still visible."
6/1/2010,"i like the general idea but think it needs a bit more development. for example, velocity vector isn't the only thing you would be interested in; it might also help to know the envelope (the approximate surface that represents the places the target could reach in a certain period of time) based on what you know.furthermore, some thought has to be given to unintended consequences; this kind of vector would, for example, make it easier to figure out where a target is trying to warp to."
6/1/2010,"the envelope concept seems to be strictly zoom dependent, because if you zoom out the envelope would become littler. this seems to be the opposite of what i proposed. what i wrote also is quite simple, and the devs could build without a lot of effort.about warping to, if you 'look at' a ship you can already understand that, or even if you keep it centered while it's warping. so yes it is an easier way to get information... but info that you already have.about arrows - the vector imo shouldn't have arrows, as you can see where it starts and ends thanks to the ship brackets in space."

6/1/2010,"excellently stated, dierdra! unless ccp commit to a change--or many changes--in the way they approach the management of releases, i fear eve will simply become too fractured to maintain in any significant way over time. besides the release of half-baked features, i'm also concerned about wasted resources when nearly-done features are scrapped because they weren't 100% finished by some artificial deadline. if the time, effort, and expense to get a feature to 85% or 90% is invested, then it's worth staying on track and taking the time needed to finish it. i suspect players will happily support ""missed deadlines"" (look at the positive response when tyrannis got delayed; what happened when it did get released is another story)--especially if it means they get a better product. in my view, part of a commitment to excellence must include a commitment to extending release dates realistically when doing so will result in a more robust feature set. related to that, the investment in nearly-done features should be leveraged by allowing work to continue past deadlines so that the feature can be finished. it can then be deployed in a patch or next release. scrapping features that already have significant investment should be a rare exception, not the rule. any development model that demands slavish devotion to the latter is fiscally insane, not to mention dangerously demoralizing to development teams and ultimately hugely disappointing to customers."

6/1/2010,supported.9 month releases is more than enough and makes more time for quality. to be honest i would rather see only 1 expansion per year as long as:- there are minor bug fixes/releases on regular basis to fix known issues- the expansion is tested alot and input's from players on forums and the testserver are being taken seriouslymake it so...engage!
6/1/2010,"supported. expansion every 9 months, or even a year, can only lead to better overall expansions and quality control."

6/1/2010,supporting this. we want ccp to pay down technical debt. we are willing to sacrifice a release as necessary to see existing and new features reach excellence.

6/1/2010,"supporting this. lately it has become more and more of a chore to even enjoy this awesome game. this game has the potential to be amazing, but has always stopped short by ignoring simple gameplay issues in favor of pushing more bullet point features.i know it's the beaten horse around here, but eve deserves some more attention aimed at improving it's existing code and features over implementing some shiny new addition."
6/1/2010,supporting this.
6/1/2010,1
6/1/2010,"supported.ccp have proved themselves to mainly develop short term fixes and shiny new toys, while always ignoring midterm effects of the fixes made and new toy introduced. claiming to have a long term agenda is fine, but the constant promise of better toys in the next patch is by now getting close to insulting. once a feature is introduced it is mainly forgotten for six to twelve months and mishandled in a haphazard way somewhere down the line for 'balancing' purposes. everything doesnt have to be cheap, available or exactly the same, it removes challanges and opportunities.the fact that most fixes mainly focuses on cheaper/'balanced' pvp stuff usually means that industry and trade aspects are all but completely ignored.some examples of poor balancing is t2 lottery and later om invention, t3 and its balancing, the current handling of the introduction of pi, the boosting of meta item drops, the handling of bugged complexes, the handling of the min/max bugged npc orders, moongate etc.boosting drops considerably while simoultanousily reducing the building requirements for interfaces is not a good way of balancing invention. boosting t3 drops while changing the end bpcs runs, but not removing random outcome nor introducing reprocessesable t3 is not 'fixing' t3. new bottle neck, silly amounts of unused t3 bpcs and no problems solved is the end result. it is getting tiring and i have somewhat lost faith in ccp's abilties when it comes to handling market and industry. market and industry is also pvp, but ccp are slowly removing most challenges and opportunities by sheer ignorance."

6/1/2010,"the point is the drake is simply more viable, especially as it gets more ehp with *almost* the same dps. tempest align (shield nano neuting kiter fit): 10.2 sec. (900 dps using light drones, 3.5 + 31km) (two heavy neuts and medium ecm drones). sleipnir: 8.6 sec. that's 1.6 sec difference in aligning. (and not a single armor mod :p) (700 dps including drones, 3.5+35km)pretty much exactly same ehp. speed, sleip is marginally faster (143m/s). yes the vaga is faster and has more falloff, however this is the only viable sleipnir fit as the active tank fit lacks a mid slot and cpu and capacitor (or tank when not). not to mention a drake and a harb has more ehp than it and comparative dps (armored cane too, but dps somewhat lower)field commands in my opinion to be able to fill their role as a small gang ship should be performance wise decidedly better than tier 2 bc's (they're not) and somewhat weaker than tier 1 bs's (they are way weaker). which is where my boosts would place them. if all the other cs's get boosted the sleip will be the worst, boost all of them and i think they will all be very balanced against each other. the astarte possibly falling somewhat behind but that's a brutix hull problem more than anything. and these ships really need a boost, surely we can agree on that?as for the rifter fit, it's t2 guns and rolled tungsten plate, rest was cheap named (very common fit), with dram all t2 and deadspace ab. (faction/t2 ammo included in cost). heh and yeah i lost my dram to one of those 350 mill drams :p"
6/1/2010,"drake: yeah, the lack of a sixth mid really kills the nighthawk. if any of them need boosting, it'd be the one. tempest: a naked tempest with a mwd active gets an 18 second align. sleipnir is 12. just how many agility mods are you fitting? the only way i get 10.2 seconds is with four nanos and a gang boost(which i haven't been using, to keep the numbers standardized). also, in order to fit two heavy neuts, a mwd, cap booster, lse, and a full set of 1600s, you need a rcu. where the hell are your damage mods? by the time you fit the dcu, you've shield tanked a ship with six lows, and have exactly zero damage mods equipped. and no, we do not agree that these ships really need a boost. that's the whole point of this argument. the nighthawk could use a mid in place of a low and some extra pg. the astarte could use a utility high and the fitting for a gang link(though the medium neut that would inevitably be put there instead might make it a bit op for solo work), but that's just on the principle that every command ship should fit a link, as a solo ship it's fine. the absolution is fine, and the sleipnir is fine. maybe a bit of dabbling around the edges can be justified, but nothing serious, and adding a full slot and a lot of fitting to use it certainly qualifies as serious. have you ever looked at what a sniper hac is capable of? comparing a sniper zealot(the best of the lot) and a sniper megathron(decidedly mediocre), the mega has 76k ehp to 21k, 312 dps to 290, and 183km optimal to 114km. costs about 50 mil less to lose one, too. and when the fighting gets closer, it's even got a pretty nice set of drones to throw in, where the zealot's got nothing. the mega would undoubtedly kick the crap out of a zealot under any conceivable circumstances...until you remember that the zealot can move, and the mega can't. field command ships, when viewed solo, are in much the same category as hacs - they're not ships with a battleship's raw stats, but they make up for it with mobility, tracking, and all that other stuff. the gang links also make them dual-role gang boosters, which a battleship isn't. i'm not sure exactly what standards you're trying to judge these ships by, but by any sane standard i can think of, the class is generally fine. needs a few tweaks, sure - what doesn't? but you're talking about a wholesale renovation, which is frankly silly."
6/1/2010,"the stats are with mwd off as any sane person does not run a mwd more than needed. secondly the tempest fits no armor mods... why do you even fit some? the difference with both mwd on is 2.7 seconds.

6/1/2010,"yes please, even the playfield a little by making cs worth their buck."
6/1/2010,sounds good to me.
6/1/2010,"i would like to explore this issue from a newcomers perspective, seeing as i'm a newcomer. i'm not sure how long i'll be playing-- shoot, i might not be playing in a month even. i haven't explored the game fully, and i have no clue if i want to play. now, when i started, a friend told me about the learning skills, and being a mathematically minded person, i saw how incredibly important they are. so, i trained 1-3 in all the skills without a second thought. at this point, i've finished the tutorials and trained the requisite skills the tutorials required, and i still haven't seen what eve is about at all. i want to go into, say, ""industry,"" but i quickly realize that without taking the learning skills further, i will fall behind everyone else rapidly, meaning i would be less competitive within a month. if i do take the learning skills further, i won't be able to try industry (or what-have-you) out in the first place, leaving me with the question, ""why play the game in the first place, and thus train these skills at all?""so i did what i was advised to do. i set the learning skills and tier 2 learning skills to my desired levels and all but ignored the game for a few days. i was away from town anyway, but it's not hard to imagine at all that another person in my same situation would have simply quit the game because he/she didn't feel like spending rl money to run a game that he/she couldn't begin to play. i play games to explore, plan, and have fun. i don't play games to suffer boredom so that i might suffer less boredom later.quote from me to a friend to recruit her, ""yeah, if you're going to play, sign up a couple days before you are able to really sit down and play. otherwise, you'll be stuck doing nothing while you train learning skills.""/signed a fresh out-of-the-box newbie"
6/1/2010,"not wanting to be an asshat here, but this game requires patience to be trained to at least lvl 4. the trial argument aside (which i can fully understand), after learnig skills you still have a long way to go if you wanna get the full eve experience... here's hoping you do pull through tho, in eve patience usualy gets rewarded."
6/1/2010,good idea
6/1/2010,"remove the learning skill, and double the training speed.sp is only useful up till a certain point, 80m sp pilot wont benefit much at 120m sp. whereas a new 50k sp pilot would be immensely better at 40m sp.allows new pilot to quickly get in on the action, and existing pilot to roll alts and open new account.also attributes... a bit redundant to me. since again they only effect the training speed. perhaps make them more piloting related? (perception>agility, willpower>tank? etc) too similar to other mmo?"
6/1/2010,"i had a simple idea and i'm surprised no one else had brought it up already...leave the learning skills in and move them all up to level 5 for everyone, from the starting character to the oldest recruit. then no one loses a thing and everyone's equal. the main difference between people's training times could then be implants and remaps. (also, remove the faster training speed up to 1.6m thing, or adjust it to 5m or something)voila, new characters could get into the action a little faster, and old characters who hadn't yet leveled all of them to 5 would skill up a bit faster. for those who had them all at l5 already, give them some kind of 'congratulations' award or some kind of tangible reward?"
6/1/2010,"don't worry, when ccp gets around to it i'm sure they'll manage to find a solution that infuriates everyone equally."
6/1/2010,i think it's a brilliant idea. maybe it could be as simple as removing the 2nd tier of learning skills and sticking with the basics. but either way.../supported
6/1/2010,"in eve you do unfun things for the long-term benefit. that's the learning skills for ya in a nutshell.see, the thing is, you and malcanis are barking up the wrong tree: you realize having to spend much time on the learning skills potentially hampers a newbie's enjoyment of the game; yet instead of tackling said learning skills, you get upset with everyone suggesting to new people that they should do them. and that's kinda silly; because as long as learning skills exist, newbies simply will spend a predominant amount of time of their beginner's experience doing those learning skills. not because i, or others, tell them so, but simply because the learning skills mechanics themselves dictate that a high game-efficiency is best achievied by doing them. i didn't create that game mechanic; ccp did.writing very angry posts about how newbies should not be doing so much learning skills, and just have a good time, is simply fruitless. high game-efficiency is geared towards doing the learning skills at an early age; and people like efficiency. in fact, asking people to stop thinking about efficiency and to just to have fun, runs very counter to human nature. you're free to do so, of course; but it's just not very productive.instead, were it not much better if you saw the merit of the op's proposal, and that doing away with the learning skills altogether would serve everyone? the newbie, no longer able to be motivated to wanting to be more efficient in training than he is now, can simply go do as you suggest: have fun. and the older players, provided they won't be training slower than they are now, won't mind either.ranka mei's law: richer, older players always have an overwhelming advantage: live with it."
6/1/2010,totally and completely and very loudly supported.i now have 1300 contacts in one very big long useless list... (i've been around awhile...)thank you very much... not.---which brings me to another issue - anyone got a link for a thread to give support for upping the limit to number of contacts...300... you have to be kidding... to even make my address book *functional* again i would have to delete 1000+ contacts *one by one*.not happening...link anyone?
6/1/2010,"i'm supporting this to come back, but since ccp has said they are going to do so, or something similar, i mostly support this because they had to remove them first, and i want some place to put my dissapointment."
6/1/2010,"agree. ccp, please bring back a contacts list and its ability to create folders."

6/1/2010,maybe the new system will help to reduce system wide lag?mayb you will choose more wisely on who you add to the list. maybe ccp doesn't want it used as intel as much as it is right now. just guessing ...
6/1/2010,"wow. yeah, not only do we need custom folders back, we need a way to make it easier to put people in custom folders. it could get rough moving people into custom folders when you had a large list of contacts -- having a right-click drop-down menu with an 'add to folder...' option there would be superb.but, removing custom folders? hello? :("

6/1/2010,"logo for everyone tabarnak! ccp epic fail, support widot brosef logo drama"
6/1/2010,"ccp, we, your customers, are still awaiting an answer.thank you for your prompt response."
6/1/2010,"ignoring something that you say you will fix for years is pretty awful. then again sort of in line with alot of things ccp does (t20, broken grids, pos's shooting everyone....).support for what its worth."
6/1/2010,"ankh, you wouldn't be just throwing these threads to the masses to discuss and then abandon them, would you? you've brought up some thoroughly valid points, but so have some of the posters in your thread. will you answer/discuss or just sit and wait until you have enough support to feel entitled to take the matter to the csm?"
6/1/2010,"^^ loving that.its true though, this is supposed to be a 'discussion' area after all.what i'd like to see in missions has already been covered. ccp have had crusades against the lag beast before now, and the ridiculous swarming in missions has always struck me as being a huge source of processing time that could be easily whittled down, whilst still maintaining the same end result.take a well known lvl 4, angel extravaganza, it generates:* 24 frigates* 6 destroyers* 23 battlecruisers* 29 battleshipsplus a bunch of cruisers and turretsall of these have whatever sort of imagined fits npc's actually use. and as someone mentioned previously, all the empire bears (of which i used to be one of) get to the point of ""i can fit x-large booster/2x armour reps and perma run so i win missions, yay""the odd token mission that's difficult due to jamming (various guristas missions) or having lots of tracking disruption (serps room wc4) doesn't actually add risk to the mission, they just slow it down.another ongoing comment from ccp is they're stance of encouraging people out of empire and into low/null sec. the thing is (and i know this from personal experience) the difference between pve and pvp setups is a very hard mindset to break, which essentially slows peoples personal development into the pvp side of things (and this is supposed to be a pvp sandbox isn't it?)so what do i think eve needs?what's already been mentioned, but taking it to a logical end-point.so:*npc ships fitted with a more pvp flavour, neuts, nos, jammers, disruptors, dampeners, remote reps, smart bombs (especially on the bs's) to deal with player drones.*instance budgets to reduce the number of physical ships, and keeping it varied.*npc's that, when damaged sufficiently, will have a percentile chance of warping out to rep, then warp back in to continue the fight.this, if done correctly, would not only improve the quality of experience in pve, would also help reduce lag/system load, and ease people into a proper ship fitting mindset.of course, pertaining to another thread that's running along side this one about ccp and their commitment to excellence, i'd love to see a ccp response to this discussion.but i worry that that might be hoping for too much.emrys."
6/1/2010,"supported. the pve in this game is a joke, and completely unrelated to anything you'd possibly use for pvp. i'd also add that npc's should play by the same rules as players, no shooting torpedoes 50km, energy vampires that can take you to 0 cap, ecm unrelated to sensor strength, or immunity to all ewar because of ""interferance"".i seem to remember when the ai for sleepers was introduced, there was a lot of enthusiasm about how it would be trickled down to existing npc's to make them more interesting than suicidal bags of hitpoints that can't use a warp drive. an unfinished idea from ccp? surely not."
6/1/2010,"1. who said this was supposed to be a pvp sandbox? u? then security status and concord would not exist and there wouldn't be non-pvp activities at all, especially mining.2. most of the ewar u mentioned already exists on rats. the rest goes against sandboxing.3. there is no ""proper"" ship fitting--that's what makes it a sandbox. what u want to do is take the sandbox away and turn it into a wow clone. wow is that way... 4. and why change only missions? why not mining as well? u want pvp, go pvp--that's what pvp is for. um...yeah...that's probably why they call it ""pve"", not ""pvp"". refer to #4. but plz, continue. i wanna see what other excuses ppl have to offer when they're somehow being griefed by someone playing the way he wants to."
6/1/2010,i'd love the monotony of my main source of income to be relieved.
6/1/2010,"too literal on the pvp bit there, i wasn't necessarily meaning combat, its supposed to be a player ran/fuelled environment, with as little input from npc's as possible, and sure, i don't expect to see pure pvp fits for missions, though a 20+ rrbs gang would maul through a lvl 4 loltastically fast.as for the ewar on rats, yes, some exists, though npc nos is like old-school player nos, and you cant eccm npc's. also you cant jam them, which with budget allocations for missions would become a more viable prospect (like having an e-war fit scorpion actually running a mission more effectively than your usual cookie-cutter golem.which also answers point 3, it would offer/force more varied fits into missions rather than the same old pith/gist boosting golem or what have you.and yes, i don't see why it cant influence the mining, actually encouraging more strategically organised mining gangs with combat support even in empire rather than the same old tired hulk/indy combo. hell, if miners have some support with them, it might cut down on the number of whines about hulks not tanking harder/more :)em."
6/1/2010,"i recommend simply revamping rats/missions entirely. make them more diverse, and make the rats harder. but i'm not against the rest of the suggestion. i would still like to see these ""special events"" focused in low-sec primarily, for two reasons: 1) it would make more sense for a pirate faction to gain a foothold in a part of space where concord has no power, and 2) because it would give the mission runners an opportunity to be cutthroat about the whole thing. mission runners blowing each other up for loot? hells yes!"

6/1/2010,"this is an idea a corp member and i came up with to keep high-sec pirates from being such a nuisance. what i suggest is that anyone who gets themselves concorded will not be paid insurance,this way it's not just targeting high-sec pirates, but all people who do illegal things in high-sec. the problem comes from the smart bombers taking out small haulers runing between jita and hek. there is a string of systems where bombers just random attack people, smart bombing them to death then have a friend come in a scoop up the remains. they then use the insurance to buy a new battlehsip and more insurance to go back out and do it again. my corp mates and i came up with 2 ideas to deal with this. ban smart bombs from high-sec, or make it so no one couldn't collect insurance if they get condorded. we felt the insurance idea was better cause it also delt with the hulkagedeon guys, as well as punished any and all who break the law in high-sec. we felt this made sense, since in real life if you were to burn your house down to get the insurance, and were caught, they wouldn't pay you. we also believe this would not completely eliminate high-sec piracy, it would just make it so the pirates would have to be more creative.if you agree with this please join in and help us get this changed."
6/1/2010,"i concur, if it took skill and more than a couple of weeks to train throw away alts to do this, it would be one thing, but as is, to easy for noobs to fly around bombing anything in sight./signed"

6/1/2010,high-sec space should be safe space. i agree with this
6/1/2010,"after reading thru previous posts on this, my first visit to these suggestion forums, i think my suggestion is now kind of like going to a city council meeting in new york city and asking for a pot hole to be filled.... but here goes...please make the ""keep at range"" options useful. for instance, make one option 2400m to keep ships just far enough away from an orca to still stuff ore in it. also make one option 5900m so i can keep my log ship in range to rr. and without trying to stir up a lot of dust about exploits, how about making one option a player's designated default range option to replace or augment the difficult to be exact option of ""current""? i've only been playing since '04, but i've never encountered a good tactical reason to keep my range at any of the three permanent options available. i use 500m because it is better than nothing unless i happen to hit a desirable distance and manage to select ""current"" while busy doing everything else needed to survive or thrive.thank you."
6/1/2010,"agreed.the ""level 5 agents sending people to hisec"" was a problem before ""load balancing"". by inclusion of the ""no more safe level 5s"" statement, ankhesentapemkah has inadvertently turned this into a ""hisec level 5s"" thread instead of a ""missions send us too far away from home base"" thread. i've contributed to that too, so guilty as charged, your honour.my own opinion is that hisec agents should be allowed to send you to/through lowsec, while level 5 agents should not send you hisec. why is this my opinion? i see no problem with lowsec level 1-4 agents sending you to hisec, since plenty of other people are getting the same privilege by running hisec missions from hisec agents. there are no level 5 agents in hisec, so they should not be able to send you to hisec.if people want those +5 implants, they can organise a fleet to go run the missions to get them. this ties in with ankhesentapemkah's suggestion about telling level 1-4 missions to htfu.i'm a carebear mission runner & miner, for what it's worth."
6/1/2010,"the load balancing is odd. i like the idea in theory, (and think its stupid in lowsec), but like the guy said, he was getting sent several jumps in lowsec with 14 people...same thing is happening in hisec in some systems. is 20 too many in a hisec system? this would be a good function in hubs, but in random systems that have traffic of 20-50 people, i find it unnecessary.maybe have it scale with a higher chance (hisec obviously) the more people in system, but have no effect on traffic of under says 50 people in system?"
6/1/2010,"agreed, i've removed the l5 part and will raise it as seperate issue if necessary."
6/1/2010,"the problem is that without enough support the majority of the csm that is pvp oriented and pve averse will dismiss ankh suggestions without ever really discussing them. so while i didn't agree totally with ankh original suggestion it is worth to support the discussion. with the removal of the part about level 5 it is now way better. to add some suggestion:i would like a way to get harder missions in high sec but i agree that there should be a set of missions reserved to low sec.probably the better system would be to make low sec specific missions that can be done with smaller ships but are challenging enough and have a mission completion reward high enough to make them interesting.maybe the use of smaller ship could be enforced by limitations on the warpgates.naturally this will require better npc ai and less ships.at the same time the high sec missions would have more ships [than low sec, not more than today!] (but still with a better ai) and a lower completion payout, making them more appropriate for the use of large sized ships and/or groups of players. that should give more challenging missions in high sec and feasible missions in low sec."
6/1/2010,"as someone who runs missions, regularly, in high sec, low sec and 0.0. i'd just like to say you made some pretty big assumptions that are incorrect.i just did 30 low-sec missions (not counting 2 faction missions), 4 sent me out of system. only the faction mission sent me into high sec. that isn't very disproportionate.step back for a second here. this is an rpg-- so really, i think the backstory and environment is critical in all game design choices. is it the agent or the invading pirates that choose the location of the attacks they make that the agent needs your help in? its the pirates, those people, as you said once that ""can rot in lowsec where murderous vermin belongs."" how can you keep a straight face and tell pirates to rot in low sec, then turn around and complain that your agents go tell you to fight said pirates in low sec?if there is a better example of someone being a hypocrite, please, let me know."

6/1/2010,"um - that's how it currently works. no change is needed.you don't have control while in a plex!?!? if you are in the plex first you can set up at your optimal range from the warp in (which is static for all but unrestricted plexes), giving you a significant advantage. the only thing you lose some control on is **running away after the fight has started**. if the fleet is too big, you can always see that on directional scanner before engaging and still warp away if you want. in fact, if you're running the button you get- directional scanner notice while the target lands and activates the gate- time for the target to burn to you on the buttonbut once the fight starts in point range, you're largely committed. give people incentive to be in plexes, it lessens station/gate humping and that's a good thing.have you seen any dev communication on the matter since this?"
6/1/2010,here's hoping ccp finally pays attention to the many many many times we've all brought this stuff up.
6/1/2010,"for the ship size, i thought you meant a plex which only cruisers could enter...thats it. nothing more nothing less. you were not clear enough. thats why i said it would be weird but its not a bad idea.the second thing is the control. let says its a caldari plex, the guy is waiting at the button. he has more advantage because of the npc's with him. that's what i mean by saying no control or less. sorry if i wasn't clear enoughfor the timezone and plex spawn, a dev told me in a petition (rules forbid me to copy paste but i don't have it anyway, its deleted) that a plex will respawn in a region where you've done the quest...no more details. he didn't mention it was stuck. i seriously don't have proof and no one does. if theres a proof, please tell it and show it to me. i'm very hard headed in these issues. i'm not a fan of /you say he say so believe me/.p.s: i'm not a uber epic fan of plexing but i know how it works well."
6/1/2010,"1. chatgris was explaining advantages of current state of plexing and therefore didn't need to specify cruiser sized plexing = cruiser and below.2. what advantage do you have at gate that you don't have in plex? gtfo option is greater in plex since there might be a camp on the other side of the gate to nail you. in plex you can gtfo anywhere you want.3. read chatgris' link that explicitely describes after dt plexing issue.anyways, fw plex mechanics are botched, but they still provide some of the best ship-limited combat in the game. like almost all combat in eve however, both sides need to want to engage. npcs limit enjoyment of pvp as the number of spawns increases - but this just means you need to bring more than your opponent into the plex. wrt large gang combat: so, you get a bunch of your buddies together to rush the plex (takes a bit of time)... and the opponent in a t1 frig warps away. your buddies curse you for bringing them all the way out to maintenault (or some other far off system) to kill npc rats or orbit a button with no fight.wrt 1v1: 1v1 in fully spawned plex is nearly impossible. 1v1 in lightly spawned caldari plex is nearly impossible too because you (me) get jammed the majority of the time. to get decent 1v1 you have to rush an unspawned plex. if the plex is one where the spawns don't trigger until you get within range of the button, then you get a good fight. otherwise you have to get in, kill as quickly as possible, and then gtfo. and the main problem is there's no way to tell if the plex is spawned or not unless you warp in and risk getting tackled. in any case, defender who doesn't want a fight just bails and waits for respawn. then he comes back with a bunch of npc assistance. bottom line: if defender is more interested in closing plex than fighting, then plexing warfare is really, really boring. if defender wants fight, plexing warfare is a blast."
6/1/2010,copied from my post above: it is the 14th post in this thread:ccp greyscale's post on the matter.it is an official dev post on the matter.
6/1/2010,"i support this thread. i like the idea of a pirate faction. as to the dt plex spawn system, why cant there be a script to run it it at 4,6,8, or 12 hour intervals? that way all tz's get a chance."
6/1/2010,"current situation: there's a whole lot of nifty things you can colour stars by in the f10 map, ranging from number of times you've been there to who controls them. new in tyrannis is the ability to colour by planet scan range, which is just a given number of light-years based on your skills. we also have the(well-hidden) capital navigation window, which tells you what system you can jump to and how many isotopes it will cost. proposed change: merge these two, and give us the option to colour stars by whether they're in range of our jump drives. perhaps include a scan probe-style ""soap bubble"" effect around them to indicate your range visually. there's other cool things you might be able to do here(the tooltip when you hover over the system telling you how many topes you need, a ""ruler"" to measure distances, colour by number of jumps required to reach a system, etc.), but that level of function would make me happy. benefits: better visualization of your capital's jump range, easier planning of capital operations. also, icsc's servers might appreciate the reduction in workload. drawbacks: slight increase to clutter of the ""colour stars by..."" list, but that's already so long that this won't matter much."
6/1/2010,"this is so well hidden i didnt even know it existed :o where can i find it?also, supported."
6/1/2010,supported - sensible proposal.
6/1/2010,"go into the esc menu, shortcuts tab. create a shortcut for ""open capital ship navigation"", then use that shortcut while in a cap ship. shows you cynogen arrays in range(i assume, my alliance doesn't own any to test with), and shows you jump fuel costs for every system within range."
6/1/2010,makes sense. pretty please do this before i can fly capital ships.
6/1/2010,"this already exists, unflatten your map while in a capital ship.confirming all cynogens owned by your alliance show up in capital navigation, as well as whether or not they are in range."
6/1/2010,"first, the eve skill training model is not too rigid. you are not limited to one character - you can get other accounts and train skills twice as fast for as long as both accounts are subscribed. two 10m sp characters are more powerful than one 20m sp character, simply because you can bring more modules into action in any fight (or have twice as many production/research slots, or control twice as many pos guns, or have your own covert ops scout, etc).second, the easy way to ""catch up"" with a veteran player is to buy their character. veterans are now at the point where they're flying a titan and are now training up to fly every other race's titan, be marketing moguls, anything to keep that sp counter running. you'll catch up with them because they're standing still.third, ""too slow"" is subjective. your measure of ""too slow"" is based on other people's opinions about other games. so you're taking other people's opinions about other games, and interpreting that to somehow reflect on eve online - how is that not subjective?now if you were to raise the suggestion that the 100% learning boost should be increased by another 2m sp every year, i'd support that. most characters will build around 10m sp a year. between three characters on one account, that gives you ""free"" sp slightly less than a single character will have trained in the meantime. you can keep cycling your training to the boosted character and still not disadvantage those people who are focussed on training one character."
6/1/2010,op lost. now lets let this thread die. do not support.

6/1/2010,"aw yeah, the rich get richer!"
6/1/2010,crappy idea.
6/1/2010,"anybody would think that the sp gain rate was deciding upon by a carefully considered consensus of bitter old veterans.to determine if an idea is bad or not, look at the whiners.if the whiners are generally unknown, it's probably a bad idea.if the whiners are known, regular bitter old veterans, the chances are it's a great idea that definetly cuts off their comfortable isk or advantage supply.since i don't care for character trading, this system would be all good news.you see, people say eve expansions are free.they're not.they are paid for expansions.you pay with $look at skill requirements for anything. super capitals perhaps.those requirements are the cost of that expansion in eve. instead of ""sp"" being the requirement, you can easily substitute $ instead, therefore you can easily subsitute isk instead.anything that the bitter old veterans come out and take the time to whine about is almost certainly a very good idea, otherwise they'd be ignoring you by now.the sp gain rate was chosen to reflect how much ccp charge for expanded game content. ccp want $, people want content. they'll find a way to come together. ccp didn't make the sp gain rate variable for no reason.supporting anything bitter old veterans cry about, because it can only be good for the rest of us.this is csm thread anyway, anything that occurs here has no value or consequence. pointless in all senses."
6/1/2010,read the devblog on isk buying and it will explain why this is a bad idea. eve is a universe where your real life income doesn't matter. anyone of any financial background can enjoy a fair playing field (as long as they pay the subs.)thoroughly not supported. no microtransactions in eve. plex selling is already enough.

6/1/2010,ccp!! please make dust for pc!! it will create so much more dept for eve and especially be cool in combination with sov claiming (wich you made easyer). your dicission so far is a total backstab to me and the entire eve community.
6/1/2010,"and consoles already have modern warfare 2 n things like that, if they cant link the game direcly with the same machine, theyll never chose dust over all the competition. as the the intrest of a console player is not in pc games, and the communication between pc and console gamers is a poor one. (in effect also between eve and dust 514 as you need to communicate in 2 different consoles and games, that contect will then barely be made)."
6/1/2010,"i don't support.developing for console and developing for pc are two different animals- so, to focus on both will likely be to the detriment of both.furthermore, i doubt having some people on consoles and some on pcs would make for a balanced match, so the two populations would have to be kept separate. too much hassle. if the dust population crashes for consoles, i imagine they will port to pc, but for the time being, this is a waste of csm time."
6/1/2010,"supported. console exclusivity is silly. the only reason some companies do so is because a) pc games get copied illegally; and b) pc games get hacked. the former doesn't apply at all. and as for the latter, granted, a console-exclusive dust 514 wouldn't see much macro-mining, but overall eve is still considered one of the least hackable games around.also, way to alienate your current, loyal pc fan-base, ccp."
6/1/2010,"the thing that worries me about dust being a console only game is the definite possibility that the game will simply be unpopular with console gamers and will leave ccp and the rest of us that either don't own consoles or simply are not interested in having to switch platforms to play a new part of the game with a useless extension that will torpedo part of the whole pi hype.console gamers are hard to please and games with bugs (which ccp seems to have a particular love for) very seldom get anywhere and usually end up gathering dust (yay, pun) on the shelves. in addition to that, dust is being built using the ut3 engine. in addition to the fact that ut3 is no longer all that popular, there are very many fps games for consoles and the odds of dust being more popular than say, halo, or a new version of half life are slim indeed.i think the only people who would put up with ccp's release first, debug later development pattern are the people who play eve now.tl;dr: bring dust to the pc so at least someone will actually play it."
6/1/2010,!
6/1/2010,"sadly, not supported.yes, of course i'd like all bugs fixed first; who wouldn't? but you got to look at the bigger picture. ccp simply has to bring out new expansions ever so often. if they don't, the game dies. why? because of the very simple economic principle that to stand still is to fall behind. i know people -- myself included, lol -- kinda tend to think of people working at the marketing department as money-grubbing, single-minded folks. but the reality of any company is, that unless you can come up with new and refreshing ideas ever so often, and make progress, you will slowly wither and die.doesn't mean i think ccp shouldn't be spending more time on fixing outstanding issues. diverting some personnel from dust 514 back to eve, for one, would be a good start, i think."
6/1/2010,"agreed! this should apply accross the board. scarcity is the mother of trade, and all that jazz. not to mention that it ruins the rp flavour of the game when everyone sells everything."
6/1/2010,oh yeh supported!

6/1/2010,just give anchored bubbles a few weeks lifetime and be done with it. either that or reduce the 200k hp on large bubbles so it might actually be faster to kill them instead of just burning through unattended sling bubbles and then warping off.
6/1/2010,bubbles are a pretty good game mechanic.besides which if you don't like them go to low-sec. but the camps there are just as lazy.
6/1/2010,i look forward to podding you when you encounter my heavy interdiction ship since you clearly outlined the fact you are a noob and your easy prey.serious response: you honestly think that removing the one thing that most pilots can train for without taking the path of interdiciton ships is really that smart? sounds to me like your just crying over the fact you got yourself ganked.the most obvious stupid part about this is your nerfing one of the most effective defense systems in null-sec/whs.constructive bit:pro tip: look before you leap... don't be foolish and fly blindly into something without scouting ahead. otherwise... if you can't take the heat.... stay out of lowsec/nullsec/whs my fuzzy little carebear.the only bit (which is not listed) ill support:actual issue i see with them is when you come across an obsessive compulsive bubble wacko who spams the area with literally dozens of them... you die of fps/lag before you actually get popped. yuck.

6/1/2010,it took me quite a bit to figure out the exact website address name for my first visit to it being it was literally listed nowhere (not in patch notes nor the dev blog about evegate). i could have simply typed evegate.com or eve-gate.com but with all the spammers/scammers irl there is no way i was gonna guess at what the address was. now i simply have it bookmarked with the rest of my eve related bookmarks.

6/1/2010,"frankly, that's a matter of opinion. most of the trash-posting i've seen directed to her is full of 'anti-pvp' accusations. the rest are full of misinformation, which brings me to my next point:you're right, that is a ****ty idea. it's a good thing that ank has never suggested such a thing. people keep coming back to a single quote taken out of context, wherein she describes a setup she had on her pvp ultima server. which is obviously irrelevent to eve, right?'jail' is not one of the potential solutions she has ever suggested within the context of eve online, to my knowledge. feel free to prove me wrong.fair enough, i suppose. but if people have an agenda that is counter to ank's, i'd say it would be much more productive to attack her suggestions as a member of the csm in a logical, intelligent way, instead of making unfounded personal attacks. this would serve a purpose. the ank-haters aren't going to get her removed from the csm. they need to deal with it, and if her ideas are flawed, then let the other csm members know which ideas are bad, and why... so far i've seen no such posts.now this is something that we can both agree on. :)"

6/2/2010,"supported.ccp claim to follow the scrum agile process. they have made good progress in finally recognising their customers (represented by the csm) as a stakeholder and involving them in the development process.however their adherence to fixed release dates is much more indicative of olde worlde waterfall development, not agile practices. agile, and scrum in particular, advocate selecting the highest priority feature (as chosen by the customer) and implementing that to a release-ready state before moving on to the next highest priority feature. it takes as long as it takes, as estimated by the pigs, not by the chickens in marketing and finance.it seems almost unique to the game industry that software is permitted to be released without proper user acceptance testing and quality gating. if ccp truly observed the best practice that they claim, they would listen to their customers' cries for quality and take a good hard look at their release management. short release cycles are not necessarily an indication of agility, when they are driven by arbitrary dates instead of production readiness. in tyrannis's case, there are clear indications of quality being sacrificed to meet a date. call it ""last minute unforeseen issues"" if you like. call it ""two weeks for players to settle in"" if you like. i call it shenanigans. every software professional playing eve knows what really happened - you *******ed up the release because you were chasing a date. it happens. it's only unforgivable if you do it again and again.full disclosure: i am a certified scrum master with twelve years of enterprise software development and software project management experience."

6/2/2010,"tbh i think the smartest thing they could do from a marketing standpoint is take 3 (or hell, 6) months and just go back and fix existing bugs and issues and release a minimum amount of new content, its what players have been practically screaming at them to do for at least a year now but ccp seem to have their fingers stuck in their ears. marketing could come up for some sort of a cool name for it if they want to feel useful. as it stands, i think a lot of eve frustration stems from new releases introducing a lot of new features designed to look pretty in advertisements (planetary interaction strikes me as a replacement for walking in stations, as imo ambulation will probably never get introduced due to the crusade players have made against it for the exact reasons i was just saying). meanwhile the game experience for veterans still feels like one based in buggy, badly written 2001 era code, i.e. one node per system and a whole bunch of bugs and design flaws introduced by development teams stuck in the mentality of ""release and forget about it"" in a number of examples with factional warfare as a glaring one. end result is that existing subscribers feel that ccp couldn't give a **** about them compared to grabbing up as many new trial accounts and prospective members as possible with flashy new content now matter how badly implemented. its sort of a disenchanting feeling when you look back on it as ccp seems to be forgetting its roots as a small down to earth company that was built on being in touch with its player-base and grown up into just another faceless international corporation that like many others seems to base most decisions on the bottom line profit. i'm not going to jump on the ""subs cancelled take that"" bandwagon since they have heard it so many times insincerely it means nothing (and i probably won't), but i can really say i've been noticing a lot less general ""interest"" in the game then i did a year ago.also bring back nanos they were counterable with heavy neuts **** carebears. tl:dr- whiny bitter vet."

6/2/2010,"okay, first off, your tempest fit doesn't actually fit - you're about 1700 pg short. second, you get an extra 2k ehp and better performance with rr from an invuln in place of the second lse. third, what idiot uses resist rigs? those things blow. fourth, with zero ambit rigs and faction ammo, you only get 31km falloff, which means that at disruptor range you're doing less than 60% of your nominal damage. as for fitting armor mods, that was a typo. i said a full set of 1600s, i meant a full set of 800s, i.e. 800mm autocannons. i should really stop making dumb mistakes if i want to win this argument. and yes, i fly command ships, i have both an astarte and a sleipnir. i don;t have a huge amount of tq experience with them, because i'm a cheap bastard at heart, but i've used them a bunch in sisi duels, and i've done enough pvp to read a stats block and have an idea of how a ship will perform. command ships are for people who want capability more than cost-efficiency, and who prefer the mobility/tracking/etc to the raw numbers of a battleship. it's not a big niche, and it never will be, the same way that pirate cruisers aren't taking over for battleships either. but it's one that should exist and it's one that they generally perform well. and despite your comparison of a nano-fit tempest with a non-nano-fit sleipnir, the agility difference is very noticeable. a pest takes half again as long as a sleip to align. a triple-plate mega takes a third longer than a single-plate astarte to align. there's also generally a 15-25% speed difference, and about a 500% difference in tracking(not a typo). as for individual stat tweaks, if you want to throw them three or four points of sensor strength, i'm fine with that. ehp is not an issue on most of them, the abso is north of 100k and the astarte is north of 70k, both of which are acceptable. the sleip is lower, but the sleip also doesn't fit as buffery a setup, and the nighthawk can do better than the absolution if you're willing to give it a four-slot tank, and is at about astarte levels with three. i've also come up with an astarte change that lets it have the gang link without giving it more slots than anyone else or gimping it - change the damage bonuses to rof(or alternately, make one of them 10%/level, which is slightly more powerful), knock off a turret hardpoint, and add about 8 pg and 20 cpu to compensate for the difference between a neutron blaster and a gang link. it's a 2.5% dps loss at max skills, but i don't think anyone will mind. and when i said the nighthawk should get an extra mid, you apparently missed the part where i said it should have one less low slot to compensate. also, how do you figure that the astarte and absolution need more fitting? the astarte fits a 1600, mwd, and full rack of neutrons with a single acr - it takes awu 5 and fits by 0.15 pg, but it fits. the absolution is tight if you want to fit the gang link and a medium cap booster, but it still only needs one rcu and two pieces of named/faction gear or a 1% hardwire to work(with t2 heavies and a 1600), which isn't crazy. i wouldn't be opposed to the abso getting a touch more fitting, but it'd be less of a boost than an upgrade to medium drones. one last thing. when you say that a field command costs 300 mil, you might want to try saying it in a post where you don't list off a fit that costs almost exactly 200."
6/2/2010,"one point that comes up a lot, if you give them enough fitting for the gang link, people will abuse it to fit a neut instead for solo work.what about giving cs's a bigger bonus to ganglink fitting such that they can easily fit a ganglink, but only a ganglink. at the end of the day these are command ships, they are meant to be running with 1 link, they shouldn't have to gimp their fitting in order to do it."
6/2/2010,"i've just come up with another idea which might help nighthawk a lot: replace kinetic damage bonus with rainbow one i don't see it making nh any more overpowered than the current raven hulls, which in fact have exactly the rainbow damage bonuses (rof actually, but that's still dps)."

6/2/2010,"the fit most certainly fits without even needing implants... :/ are you sure you got an up to date eft? and sorry you're right, extenders rigs + invul is what it should be, i posted my cheap fit apparently :/ hehe seems we both make them :) sisi duels really have nothing to compare with tq pvp really, it's ok for testing if a fit is viable, but it really does not represent how pvp is on tq in any way, not to mention most opponents one fights on sisi have ******ed fits. i fly every class of ships of every single race pretty maxed (sub capital) and the agility difference is rather minimal actually, it's generally better to just stick a inertia mod on a untrimarked geddon than flying an absolution. a drake almost gets the same stats as you're absolution stats...if you drop a low slot from the nighthawk it either looses the rcu needed to fit stuff or a dmg mod which means it's dps sucks even more, or do we agree nighthawk needs a fitting increasing, i think we do? the astarte needs more tank or more dps, a shield gank myrmidon with tackle and mwd gets 68.6k ehp (vs the 70k quoted) of you're fit while doing just shy of 800 unheated... so we have established that the sleips buffer isnt that viable, well here comes the surprise, neither is it's active tank unless you buy a crystal set or faction booster (however we're balancing around t2 setups). with a mwd, scram/disrupt and a cap booster, it's cap lasts 1 min and it only have 2 slots for tanking.. and despite it's price, like all the other cs's it does not tank you're average battlecruiser even with standard blue pill! in fact you need the claymore (+1 med) for that, which by the way is actually a better sleipnir (guns + hams and it gets a gang link!!!!). did i also mention those ships that directly compete with field cs's cost merely a fraction, take less skills and give 90% of the effectivness? this is one of the reasons i want to see these ships boosted, i don't really care how they do it, as long as they get the advantage they deserve. (and i do not mean overpowered advantage like :p)i figure they both need fitting considering they both need fitting mods and/or faction mods to fit what should be a decent setup, if they can fit them without fitting mods, a lot of the problems suddenly goes away. whops, typo there, meant 250m difference. as for you're vision of a field command's niche vision, you may wish to check out t3 cruisers, they do everything for 2.5 times the price, but 5-10 times better, ehp wise, gang boosting wise, (damage is pretty similar), take less skills, no fitting issues, recon sensors! and so on... as i said, the field commands are out of date, they need something to bring them back up to date :)(i hope i covered all, i'm very tired ^^)vehlin : i agree, that would also be a very good thing and would solve half of the fitting issues!"
6/2/2010,"loved this discussion, so many good ideas for improvements. ccp, you have no excuse to delay these fixes past the next expansion! the only thing i'd add is that warp speed should be increased to 4.5 au/sec, and that the coercer definitely needs a second midslot - if all the other destroyers get more than one midslot, they can be used for solo pvp (propulsion + point), if coercer is left at 1 it'll only be useful as an escort or a pve ship, regardless of other changes."

6/2/2010,"how about giving ""some kind of 'congratulations' award or some kind of tangible reward"" for those who don't have any learning skill trained insted ? or, pick any set of your skills and change their bonus for mentioned rewards .....imho, learning skills were a mistake (and i think i have read ccp considers them a mistake). however, this mistake is of that kind which gets worse when tried to ""fix"".it is like a bear trap. you can try to get out by taking of your leg, or you may just sit in it, because the chain the trap is attached appears to be long enough, and surroundings are nice."
6/2/2010,i see why learning skills are concidered a flaw in design by some. and especially annoying for newbies. but on the other hadn i agree that it adds another level of specialisation to this game which is what makes eve so special.however if they remove learnings and i don't get that 10 attributes +10% and that 5.376.000 sp back that i have in learnings i'm out :)i don't spend isk or rl money for a game where the only thing that really matters rl time is (like in training your skills).i don't see why i would spend 15 a month so i can keep playing but with a lot slower progress.it already takes a crapton of time to train some skills to 5 (like up to two month when you're into capitals) and i refuse to pay the same amount each month when my skill learning speed is effectively halfed.so there are two options:they add 10 attributes + 10% to each chacater or they reduce the amount of of money that you pay each month.and additionaly reimburse your training time that you have spend on getting your learnings to whatever level you have it at. else ccp would effectively screw you over almost 2 month worth of game time.btw i like the idea of compensating this by increasing your learning speed.so if the removal of learnings is not to be discussed and it's only a matter of how to implement it i support this topic.- cake
6/2/2010,"i agree with the removal of learning skills. they are not a fun mechanic, they are an obligation and can really deter new people from getting into the game.my main character has the tier 1 learning skills trained to 5 (back when it was required for tier 2.while i support this in spirit, the original proposal might cause some imbalances. perhaps something were players are rewarded attribute points over time would cause less issues.maybe something like players at their 1 month mark get +1 to all attributes and so on would work better."
6/2/2010,"this sounds like a pretty decent way to compensate people for their training time invested in learning while keeping the max rate of sp gain the same and getting rid of a poor mechanic. its not really fun or fair to newbies to have to invest in a timesink so early in the game. this game is brutal enough on new players.one thing i would like to add to it though is an isk compensation for the skillbooks. while the base learning skills are cheap as rocks, the advanced ones are rather pricey for new players. i remember having to make sacrifices in what ships i could afford just to buy the learning skillbooks and i feel it would be a kick in the teeth for the newb who just spend their savings to train up these skills just to lose them immediately without getting the isk back."

6/2/2010,"so in other words, u want to force pvp fleets just for missions so that even more ppl can solo afk macro mine?and what if they ecm spam your scorpion? u can't run since u're guaranteed to be warp jammed and u can't fire back since u're ecm'd. and since u're ewar fit, u have almost no tank to even survive. hell, even tracking disruptors will achieve the same result so no, your ill-thought out idea is as ridiculous as the whole proposal. and no, forcing a warp jammer into every pve fit is not offering more varied fits, although it is forcing pvp and fleeting into pve but again, if u wanted that...just pvp! despite such a detailed proposal against missions, u sure didn't put many details against mining...what a surprise...care to elaborate?"
6/2/2010,"try re-reading the sentence, out loud, paying attention to where the comma's and full stops are...i don't mine, so didn't particular care, shot a few mind you.also, grammar fail on my part, had meant the scorpion being used as part of a gang. the idea being that e-war, at the moment, is strictly a pvp tool, and it would be nice to offer it up to pve types as an additional valid tool.and why not have a scram/dis or two fitted throughout a small gang, at the risking of being rp (i am in u'k after all) its always struck me as odd that npc's wouldnt warp off occasionally (from a strictly ic sense of course).em."
6/2/2010,"i don't have to re-read that sentence because this quote confirms it--u do want to force pvp fleets into missions 'cause now u're saying the scorpion would be in a fleet when u already have the option to do so as is, not to mention, u constantly mention nothing but fleeting throughout the whole post. seriously, is more ewar the only sorry excuse u got left when ppl already use target painters and webs in missions? that's what it all boils down to--u want to force ppl to help u 'cause u're incapable of defending yourself."
6/2/2010,"i honestly don't think this is going to make pve any better. i remember when l3s were the cream of the crop, and then these new exciting l4s came out. oh em gee~ they were cool for about two weeks, and then they became a boring grind again. then cosmos missions, which weren't even cool for two weeks once everyone realized they were ****, and then l5 which, again, were exciting for a week or so. oh i forgot about the epic arcs....like everyone else.so what are you going to do, make missions ""dynamic"". guess what, my crystal golem is still going to tank it, and it's still going to be boring. if you change mission rats to adapt to golems, i'll just take a passive rattlesnake. no matter what new mission element you introduce, it's going to be either a) forgotten or b) adapted to in a week. i'm not being cynical here, it's just what has happened in eve since, well, forever.but it's not all doom and gloom. you know what's still exciting? wormholes. between wormholes and escalating complexes, pretty much every dynamic that you're trying to force into missions exists. instead of trying to modify missions to become fun, just work with the existing things that are fun to make them more appealing, or :gasp: add new fun pve content."

6/2/2010,"edit: updated to reflect some posts below.the problem(s): 1: there is little incentive to use agents in lowsec, or agents who occasionally send mission runners into lowsec. 2: hisec mission running is very easy and low-risk, and at the same time earns more per hour than any other hisec profession.the solution:-agents have dynamic quality. the more people use an agent, the lower the quality. on the same token, agents which are used less will rise in quality.-create a larger disparity between the lowest and highest quality agents. not a large as the difference between l3 and l4, but large enough to instantly notice the loss of lp etc-tie bounties to system security status, so that rats in lowec give more bounty than rats in hisec, and rats in 0.5 give more bounty than 1.0good effects of this:-mission hubs like dodixie and motsu having q-19 agents. since missioning here is virtually zero-risk, the quality of the agent reflects that. this combined with the low bounty means running missions in these areas is significantly less profitable. players will move to lower security systems to get higher bounties.-agents in deep lowsec and 0.0 will have very high quality and higher bounty than hisec, increasing the payouts.-agents for obscure corporations that nobody currently finds it worth running missions for will also have very high quality agents.-agents on the border of lowsec will have higher quality because fewer people run them, as well as having higher bounty than than 0.9 space, so some (but not all) players will consider it worth it to mission there.-players being more spread out will mean that places that are not currently market or mission hubs will have more market/trading opportunities, especially in regions like everyshore where there are l4 agents but no market hubs-more people in lowsec because of greatly increased benefits of running l4s and ratting there-the players that move to 0.5 which is nowhere near lowsec will still have to contend with the fact that suicide ganking is much more viable in 0.5 space, so mission running stops being zero-risk.-agents in divisions that primarily give out courier missions (such as archives) will have naturally high quality (because everyone hates courier missions), increasing the payouts of those missions, something that is sorely needed.disadvantages:-players whining that their zero-risk isk faucets are drying up-some market hubs came about because they were initially mission hubs, so what will happen to them is uncertain-ninja salvaging will be harder as there will be fewer people in a given mission hub-it's difficult to predict how much players will actually be spread out by this, so it may be hard to figure out the exact numbers.-heavy flux in lp markets for a month or two until things calm downi mentioned lp flux; it's important to remember that while lp and missions payouts are small, they're still significant. what happens when half the mission runners in eve suddenly start getting half the lp from their now lower quality agents? the value of lp will go up. even if the price only goes up by a half, a mission that netted you 2 mil through lp item sales will now net you 3 mil. seeing as bounties will be dropping, increased profits from lp sales will help make up some of that gap, while giving another bonus to lowsec mission running on top of the increased bounties."
6/2/2010,"i like. also makes the game more immersive, as you have to wonder why isinokka still has a problem with all those gurista fleets with all the genocide going on every day. now, it might not really do anything for lowsec, but high-sec would be more interesting as people might have to move to different regions periodically, changing market hubs and the like."
6/2/2010,"you realise that the way insurance works has changed, and that it's no longer free to lose t1 ships anyway?edit: and also that ccp recently re-affirmed to the csm that suicide ganking was intended and supported gameplay. why therefore should it be ""punished""?"
6/2/2010,no support.
6/2/2010,agree with what you say except i have allways felt no insurance should be paid and this should be a factor that gankers should base their costs on. maybe the changes in insurance will be enough.
6/2/2010,if someone uses their car for a hit and run and the car gets totaled two things happen. they end up with more expensive insurance or become uninsurable and they pick up the police aggro. in game they pick up the police aggro and get a nice hefty reward for using their car as a bullet shield / tank to rob the other people / armored car / expensive thing with.
6/2/2010,anyone who thinks any comparison at all can be made between rl insurance and in-game insurance has absolutely no concept of how one or the other of the two works.
6/2/2010,"i'd have to say i don't agree with this, i'm afraid. the thing that immediately comes to mind is when i was being neuted and shot at by ninja salvagers. one of the ninja's corpmates came in while i still had timer, started firing at me, and just between him activating (no you will die warning since i still had aggro) and the guns actually firing the corp aggro ran out (i had taken from one of the ninja's cans to initiate a fight because i was being ****y, hence the aggro...) and he got concorded. i don't believe that was his fault. even though i was the target i did feel a little sorry for him thanks to this.another thing that came to mind is new players. yea, i know there's a warning but when you feel like you've got your chance to kill someone and you're a new player, no long-worded message is going to get in the way of you killing your target. ""omg get out of my way! kill them already! *yes*"" then the new player loses their ship, has no insurance payout, and is back to mining veldspar in a noob ship with one mining laser. how many people are going to keep playing after such a loss?also, no matter what you do with insurance the high-sec gankers will not be deterred by the lack of an insurance payout, especially considering that they're shooting at a hauler for its cargo; it's going to be worth getting concorded for whether they get an insurance payout or not.edit: corrected typos thanks to the magic iphone ""auto-correct"""
6/2/2010,"hey, its not me that complains that the game shows drastic lacks of realistic immersion. i live in 0.0, never have been ganked, just had my research corp decked once, took the tower down and spent five days of invention profits to make an alliance.and the point still stands, in rl you pay insurance to protect you and the other person you hit but it can be voided on your end if you do something bad like a hit and run. in game here its a way to protect your assets from death and be able to recoup some of that. the help the guy you hurt aspect is not in in game insurance to begin with but you would think the you doing something illegal would void it part would be. sure your station insurance adjustor knows that space is dangerous and thats why it cost so much. but hes a fool to insure someone who goes out and breaks the law. for a game that is supposed to be mega corporations some gallente that goes out and ganks a gallente and gets paid by a gallente insurance agent makes the gallente look dumb, and french."
6/2/2010,"this makes no sense.insurance isn't expensive. most ships are guaranteed to be destroyed during the insurance term. for the insurance 'company' to make a profit on insuring ships, they'd have to charge over the payout. instead we only pay a fraction of it.laws, otoh, have nothing to do with anything when it comes to capsuleers."
6/2/2010,i support no insurance payouts for pilots who lose their ships due to concord actions. i do not support banning smartbombs from high sec. ahs
6/2/2010,"for those of you using real life insurance analogies, i remind you that if you took your car into a gun battle in lawless territory, insurance would be void as well.so we should cancel all insurance, including fleet fights and mission losses. sound good?"

6/2/2010,"i'm in nullsec running missions for sansha's nation, a notorious pirate organization that regularly makes incursions into high sec to abduct citizens.in this particular mission, i'm taking on ded ships, but they destroy me.i still get insurance. is this fair?"

6/2/2010,good point on that. but removing insurance from suicide ganks where according to the rules made by ccp you have to suffer a ship loss that is the same as blowing up your own ship which i also think you shouldn't get insurance for. if i wanted it to be like wow i'd be in favour of 100% insurance with no module loss and you could wake up in a cloning station without having any skillpoint loss if you didn't set a clone when podded.as for 0.0 there is no laws out there to break so the post before yours that quoted me is a moot point afaic. also if you are running missions in 0.0 from the pirate factions just for the sake of roleplay you could say it was an insurance scheme from the faction you are working from. you probably even set up the insurance from the npc station you run the mission from anyway.
6/2/2010,"not supported.t1 ships stopped being free already.fypsafer, yes, but not safe.heh heh, reminds me when i was a noob and dueling some other guy i knew, first to 30% armor kind of thing and, anyway, i had to dock and refit and do something else, came out, aggro still ok, no warning, fire, concordokken.killed by module lag"
6/2/2010,"sportin'in my view insurance changes did not go far enough and the change was only negligable for bs at best. thats certainly not to say i think suicide ganking should be removed, with this change it would not be, gankers would just need to be smarter in their risk/reward equation.theres no real reason why insurance is paid out for suicide ganks. get rid of it!"

6/2/2010,"so even though it's most definitely ccp's stated desire to move the general populace out of high sec and into low and null sec you want to make it easier for people to cling? missions taking you into high sec are there intentionally to encourage you to leave high sec and see that low sec is not the big bad dangerous place people seem to imagine. here's a solution, move all level 4 agents above quality 0 to 0.0 outposts via a renting or sov upgrade system.then again you're also the csm candidate that wants to charge players real life cash for each player they kill in the game as a form of punishment, so i would imagine listening to reason won't really be your ""thing"""
6/2/2010,"you dont get more people into low sec by doing this, those who want to go to low sec use a low sec agent (way saver), and those that dont want just go to motsu/dodixie/etc, so much for load balancing.missions that take you to low sec from high sec are especially the things that lead people to believe that low sec is a big bad dangerous place you really dont want to go. you will be at border systems that are way more dangerous than deeper low sec systems, you got a pretty decent chance you get killed as soon as you jump into low sec (yes most low sec entrances wont be camped, but still the chance it is camped is a quite realistic possibility, and how often do you think someone will return to low sec when he got killed on his first jump into low sec), and otherwise probably probed down and killed.until it is changed that as soon as someone has a point on a pve ship it dies, especially when in a mission, people wont go missioning in low sec, deal with it."
6/2/2010,no support. mission runners are irrelevant.
6/2/2010,yes but ccp wont be changing things to make less avenues into lowsec. you still haven't passed that point.
6/2/2010,"gettting sent 5 jumps for a lvl1 combat mission, or lvl2 mining mission when there are only 16 people in the current system doesnt look like load balancing, it looks more like 'waste the paying customers time'!"
6/2/2010,"the simplist answer to these problems is that these ""nerfs"" should have never happened.i and alot of others were quite happy with the way things were.if ccp want to ""cure"" server pressure, then maybe they should fork out on upgrading them!personally, i've never, in 2 years, experienced game lag unless it was my own connection playing up.an <<<<<expansion>>>>> should <<<<<expand>>>>> the game with cool new stuff for everyone (maybe new mission storys) not >>>>>deflate<<<<<< it!and tbh i was really looking forward to tyrannis, and i to was totally ""deflated!"""
6/2/2010,a good idea to talk about. tentatively supported. ps. bellum's post is indicative of many pirates' inability to think beyond their own narrow perspective. i appreciate ank's effort in the op to think about the needs of both high and low sec citizens.
6/2/2010,if people are going to move to low sec and null they are going to do it anyways. there is no good reason for high sec agents to issue missions to low sec or low sec agents to issue missions to high sec. your standard high sec mission runner is going to decline the mission anyways so if ccp was trying to nerf the living crap out of mission running then mission accomplished.

6/2/2010,"[proposal] personal bookmarks visible while on gridtl;dradd a visible, selectable icon (thumbtack) that shows your own personal bookmarks on grid and no one elses.pilots are being clever, and are using the bookmark system as a method of warping to different points around an object in space. this is great, but setting up and executing these maneuvers is a pain in the ass as there are no visible indicators to use as a reference points. pilots are instead forced to use celestial objects and improvised coordinates as reference points. while this is impressive for those who do it right, this is also silly. setting up these bookmarks correctly takes ingenuity, requiring pilots to give them extensive and annoying names such as new caldari x-150 y-20 z5, new caldari x150 y20 z5, etc, and then organizing them further in order to avoid seeing 200 bookmarks all at the same time. this process consumes extensive amounts of time and patience.making the bookmarks visible in space would make this process much easier, (especially for those of us with ocd.) this would also give combat pilots a much faster method of maneuvering around a gate instead of navigating complicated drop down menus to locate the correct bookmark.the change is small and relatively painless and involves the following.  your bookmarks will appear on grid with their icons, be selectable, and appear on your overview provided you are using the correct settings. bookmark icons will function like beacons in that they can appear on your overview, except that they do not appear while off grid. for sanitys sake, they will likely need a separate entry in the overview filter settings.  it is of course also apparent that some people may have a rather large amount of bookmarks set up around a gate or in an area, in future iterations you might consider including the ability to select which bookmarks appear on grid from the bookmarks menu.rough impact analysis:-relatively easy to implement-expansion on already commonly used practice (bookmarks and their use do not change, they simply have their thumbtack icon displayed in space)-will require a small amount of development time and thus costthis proposal is hereby submitted for your consideration. if anyone wishes to support this proposal, please sign below.signed,marcus ried"

6/2/2010,"have an age cut off? your chars all have a birthday, have it just drop off. or have the thing be on a logrithmic scale price wise so what cost a noobie 1 plex in his first 5 million sp or whatever cost an old one like me 10 plex when hes at 50 million. i don't think its as much of a lets catch up to the crotchty old vets as it is just be able to do stuff. this beats the hell out of the char bazarr, with double training speed it gets people to be like that char in the bazarr faster without hearing all the *****ing about how so and so bought that char and has no idea how to use it and whoops there goes that mothership onto the killboard. saying microtransactions are not to be in the game is bs and we all know it. the second you could sell plex / gtc for isk you introduced direct to ccp microtransactions, sure the isk goes to player x instead of a sink but all the precious $$$ just made ccps pocket 35 dollars fatter for that widow that you just had to have. here is where you will make your argument that if one person uses a plex to buy something someone else gets 1 month of not paying. that would work if you got 12 plexes for 132 like you do for a 1 year subscription but you get 6 plex for 112 iirc. so for someone who does that route like i did to get my carrier ccp just mega profited as i paid for about 10 or 11 months but only caused six worth of lost transactions.this one especially is going to get me a bunch of go play wow and hello kitty online links. i don't see why doing things in game shouldn't reward you with sp. sure you learned things by injecting that skillbook in your head, we decided to go matrix style with the skilling, but in the matrix they pretty much went from 0 to 5 instantly with the exception of neo who was the monkeyshpere of the matrix and went to lol 6. i love the whole you learn while not playing thing because that is feasible, my carriers million page insruction manual isnt going to be read in a night. but you would think you would gain some knowledge of how a blaster works by going out and shooting things, especially when said blaster has pretty much became part of my body. i dont need level four thermodynamics to tell me not to touch the hot heat sink as its hot."

6/2/2010,"hi bitter vet here!tbh i'm against being able to buy isk through plex's and character trading so i'm not happy that you can buy sp's from players and not from ccp.and putting it bluntly what i don't want is someone to be able to do what i can do without spending the time and having the patience that i have.you have remaps every 12 months you can use, you have readily available cheap attribute implants we never had when we started, you have had the skills made easier so you can train the advanced learning skills (which isn't mandatory btw) and you have had a load of core skills with reduced prereq's we never had and yet you still moan and whine.it isn't us who are bitter really is it!"
6/2/2010,"if they are in their basement grinding they arent really macroing are they? and if ccp doesn't want a grind wouldn't it be logical to remove all missions from the game? and rats? and complex? really the only thing that is not grinding is when i do all my inventions and trading because that actively changes to suit what you guys are buying, and when i do that all that happens is i get rich and the pvp guys that do a ton of pve for money call me the carebear when i'm more the arms dealer then anything. maybe we should introduce just farting money, type beans!!!! into local 1000 times and get a billion iskies. eve sometimes feels like a game that doesn't want to be played at all.there is one part of this that is provably wrong. old character creation has a perma buff to learning. with a new character the max you can get in any one skill is 30 points even. with my guy from 2.5 years ago my perception is currently pushing 30.8 in perception and could still go up from his plus four to a plus five and could train the rank 3 skill from 4 to five to give him an effective 32.8 it's not much but it is a buff over what the maximum possibility is for a new person because i started playing when bloodlines mattered that much."
6/2/2010,old character creation has a buff to learning?i've been making characters for the corp i'm in every 6 months since i started this one. sure you could make the attributes higher a few years back but it's quicker to get the new characters with the skills i need to the levels because of the way you pick the attributes and you also have double the learning speed for the first one and a half or so million skillpoints.swings and roundabouts.i would like to pay for sp's though because i'm loaded iskwise and don't really use it for much other than trying to collect stuff for my own personal museum.
6/2/2010,"they were meant as separate problems.yes and /support.but in isk earning, there will always be a grind somewhere. whereas the skill system has no and needs no grind."
6/2/2010,"nope.if you can't sell your character, the amount of sp available to play with doesn't rise if you don't want that character any longer.and even if the amount of sp in eve did rise.... where is the problem if it's all been paid for?oh noes, fair fights instead of good fights? is that the problem?still waiting on this answer. getting lots of anger and bull****, but an actual answer is pretty much all that is required.even if the answer is blind jealousy.but i suspect the answer might relate to something slightly like ummm... the amount of rl cash you put into a character over time, then the amount you can sell it for on the bazaar. because rl for plex for isk just isn't enough for bitter old vets, they want rl for sp for isk at a much much higher rl -> isk conversion rate than is available for newbies with rl>plex>isk.the bitter old vet has already spent the time training his many characters and farmed characters, the newbie has not. if ccp start selling sp directly, bitter old vet has to reach for the lube.bitter old vets don't like lube.oh wait... you have a more plausible answer?that would be very interesting. sadly whatever that weird thought is bubbling up isn't an answer, it's just weird.sp devaluing? wait? what? i need more sp to fly the same ship as somebody else? i need more isk to fly the same ship as somebody else?what the blazing blueberry muffin are you going on about inflation for? it's not even relevant to the point. as well you already know. come on... come clean, get that answer out, or duck and swerve, it's real popular with the bitter vets when they're completely and utterly stuck."
6/2/2010,"i have 33 intelligence and started after they introduced remapping, are you doing something wrong? also, try to reach my perma 2772 sp/h without remapping and loosing your ""bonus"""
6/2/2010,"omg, more sp not = more options! what game are you playing dude? in any game ever invented more xp = more options."
6/2/2010,i wasn't sure how to answer this because to be fair i couldn't understand what he was on about lol.
6/2/2010,bad idea. really bad.ahs
6/2/2010,basically i was just saying that the older characters can get their skills higher then new characters can with remaps. if you were to go build a character today and train his learning skills up to level five and then throw in plus 5 implants. your character will hit 30 sp as the cutoff. older characters such as mine from 2.5 years ago before they implemented the new way to create your character creation can top out at 33 or so. and my character has been remapped by the way and i still hit the 32.8
6/2/2010,"hello, i'm surprised to see this proposal still on the first page. i expected it to have died. i thank to all of you (on both side of the coins) who kept it floating. there are too many replies, i cannot comment on them all so i'd like to rephrase a key factor of this suggestion that many seem to have missed:the average sp of eve players are about 2m but that doesnt mean 50% of eve players have more then 2m sp because of the huge amount of alt and quitted players with 6k-800k sp still sitting in the database. my personal estimation is that probably 90% of eve players will have less then 50-60m sp. assuming that's indeed the case, most of the vets here probably wont benefit from this proposal"
6/2/2010,"they only difference between ""bitter old vets"" and newer players is that the older players can do more things... that's it. there only a finite amount of skills that make you better at something in eve. once you've trained them all to 5 you'll be just as good as the vets in that particular area. more sp does not mean you are better. here is and idea. why not use those plex to buy an alt, omg!? double sp training right there. two specialized characters at 15mills sp can be better than any 50+ mills character."
6/2/2010,"i'm old and feeble and i'm tired of missing the tiny green bar at the top of the module. if i miss it is generally not a good thing because it may take another cycle or two before i notice, or i may active/deactivate a mod by accident. it's not always so easy in the heat of battle when making a lot of clicks to hit it.even if the button covered the same screen area but was a box or circle at the top of the mod or something it would be better. for instance the rack overloading buttons are small but easy to hit."
6/2/2010,use a keyboard shortcut imo-lianged: but supported. i'm in favor of all ui improvements.
6/2/2010,a key and click combo would be nice too. (ex: holding shift and clicking on the module toggles overheat)
6/2/2010,i really don't want to know how many modules i killed because of missing the button.

6/2/2010,absolutely
6/2/2010,old and feeble supporting this.
6/2/2010,completely support - the ui shouldn't be your enemy.
6/2/2010,i have real issues with this. the amount of times i've failed to toggle heat at a crucial moment due to a mis-click that has often just deactivated the module instead.supporting!
6/2/2010,"i didn't agree at first, saw the choice as a smart way to save costs, however i must agree now that i've seen the sorry state of console fps gaming.it seems to me that being a console fps game it's likely that within 4 weeks the game will be relatively dead, especially when p2p mp game hosting. there is a clear difference between fps on console vrs pc. on console fps games come and go, they are generic ports and made for cheap, hit the market, sell well, then die off ready for the next fps. whereas on pc communities form, dedicated servers are tweaked to perfection and players loyally play the same fps for years on end.console fps is a no-brainer usually, it's a quick cash injection that really does work.however if the aim is to create a strong franchise that maintains popularity over years then console is the worst place to be."
6/2/2010,**** man jesus
6/2/2010,"there are a number of definable flaws with releasing dust on console only.the lifetime of any console game is restricted to a maximum of the lifetime of the console, with many other limiting factors coming into play. competition in the console games market is incredibly fierce, games released on consoles tend to have absolutely huge marketing budgets and console gamers have short attention spans. dust may well be the best console shooter when it is released but how long can it feasibly hold onto that top spot? only until the next big thing comes out, be it another halo, god of war, final fantasy, or call of duty. to have any longevity dust will have to keep pace with developments in other console shooters and continually do better than any new releases which come along and try to tempt the playerbase away to newer and shinier toys.one thing that is essential if dust is to integrate with eve successfully is a stable playerbase, and the work needed to maintain that on a console is orders of magnitude greater than that required on the pc.if dust is released exclusively on consoles it will more than likely be a phenomenal success for a couple of months, until it is surpassed by the next big thing. this is great if it is a standalone title, with no connection to eve apart from the ip, and i'm sure that ccp will rejoice in the amount of money it makes them. however as part of the eve experience it is likely to be little more than an footnote.the entire concept of dust deserves more than this. a marrying of eve and an fps on pc can achieve that. if anyone has played planetside, the potential for deepening and expanding the eve universe into ground based combat is something that should not be done in half measures.dust for pc and fully integrated with eve, or on console but a standalone title. those are the only two options which make sense."
6/2/2010,"supported, also i do believe ccp need to add more content from time to time but the bugs in game are overwhelming atm"

6/2/2010,id rather have an expansion (even 2 for that matter) with no new content but a lot of old content completed and fixed !
6/2/2010,supporting this. expand on the existing features before adding more new ones.
6/2/2010,"instead of starting another thread that will only get a handfull of supporters and then fall by the way-side, why don't you all go to"
6/2/2010,i support this idea wholeheartedly!
6/2/2010,hell no
6/2/2010,agreed
6/2/2010,as a gallente only spec character i'm in favour of this particularly on the gunnery/blaster aspects of this thread.
6/2/2010,"as many have noticed, items on the market can be sold for any amount. i personally have problems with font and window sizes, so i have resorted to having friends by things for me on the market just to avoid any more buying mistakes. in the past, i've paid 800 mil for a mammoth and 400 mill for a shield recharger ii. i ran the game in 800x600 until i was forced to increase the resolution. now, the csms tell me i can go to low resolutions, but that may affect what i see on screen. why is this such a hassle?people should not be able to sell an item for 10,000% of its regional average. since ccp prides eve for its reality, i counter with the fact that if someone scammed me in real life as is allowed on this market, the authorities would come in and provide a hefty penalty to the offender. post your support for this thread and experiences with market scams. i would like to see who else finds this a reoccurring problem."
6/2/2010,have fun with your carbon.
6/2/2010,i don't think offering something on an open market at way above its actual value would be seen as a scam irl. just kinda dumb.
6/2/2010,it's not their fault if you can't count your zeroes. nobody would ever fall for a scam if they paid attention.
6/2/2010,i dont think you get the sandbox idea.since when did it become ccp's responsibility to protect us from our mistakes?
6/2/2010,"there are filters on the market screens.towards the right hand side, look for a little white triangle. this will allow you to filter out certain market values.personally i find the filtering options page a little bit too ""ccp friendly"" to be actually useful, but if you keep trying for a month or so, i reckon you'll get it working well enough.the filtering options are in the ""settings"" tab of the market screen.edit: oh wait, was i just supposed to troll you like everybody else?ooops. my bad."
6/2/2010,"thanks for actually replying, and i will look at the settings. for the others who didn't get the point, not all of us have 30"" monitors or good eyes. i've literally used a magnifying glass, so i ""could"" count the zeros. as far as selling for ridiculous amounts, i guess you folks don't live somewhere with a government. by your logic, we shouldn't have concord at all. just let new players die until there's so few coming in that the game turns into nothing but vets. that's a path to widespread failure of the game itself. i much rather live in a place where price gouging is illegal. but, i'm sure there will just be more trolling because screwing other people is fun to some./rant off"
6/2/2010,sort by price.scroll down until you see one in 'station' or 'system'.purchase it.repeat as necessary.
6/2/2010,"that is not a scam, you merely overpaid for a item. i fail to see how its ccp's responisbility to solve or prevent lapses in competence or common sense"
6/2/2010,how is bad eyesight a lapse in competence or common sense?
6/2/2010,"my ethics professor used to tell me ""if you ask the wrong question, you will never get the right answer.""you're asking the wrong question - or rather, trying to fix the wrong problem. the problem isn't that people can sell things at a 10,000% markup - the problem is that the font used in eve is extraordinarily unfriendly for people with poor eyesight, making it hard (sometimes exceptionally so) to make informed decisions.the problem that needs to be fixed is the game needs to easily scalable up to resolutions like 800 x 600 so that people with poor eyesight can still play the game on an even footing.so i can't support the op, but i do support, as have many others, adding additional accessibility to the eve ui for those folks who don't see as well as the rest of us."
6/2/2010,"i'm impressed by your approach. since a couple staff had told me that lowering resolution would cause functionality problems, i didn't consider what you proposed to be an option. i'm happy others are in support of accessibility changes and hope an answer will be provided soon. thank you for your reply."
6/2/2010,"you're quite welcome. one thing they could add is a screen magnifyer like some graphics applications have that let you display certain parts of the screen in much larger sizes. i would consider that an interim step to a better ui. it won't solve all of the font issues with the ui, but it would at least make counting those 0's easier."
6/2/2010,drone regions need some love. all the content is low-quality. give the non-macro guys there something to do besides mining.
6/2/2010,"ever heard of this skill? probably not. here's the ded connections skill desription:skill at dealing with concord department and negotiating bountiesbonus fee of 1,500 isk per pirate head per level of the skillthat's right, this skill you get 1500 addition isk per npc kill per level.this is completely useless. it shouldn't take too much programming to make it so that ded connections gives, say, a 5% or 10% bonus to lowsec and nullsec bounties per level. this would make these regions a tad more attractive, and make missions accepted in highsec that occur in lowsec more lucrative."
6/2/2010,"this should be simple to implement. just do the following before bounty rewards are given (so, it would be checked around every 15-20 minutes per system):check ded connections skill level.if ded connections skill level < 1, award bounties.if ded connections => 1, check system's security level.if system's security level > .5*, award bounties.if system's security level < .5*, add (ded connections skill level)*bounties*.05 to bounties and award bounties.(actually .45 because of truesec)"
6/2/2010,"the simplist answer to the problems missioners are experiencing is that these ""nerfs"" should be reversed.i and alot of others were quite happy with the way things were.if ccp want to ""cure"" server pressure, then maybe they should fork out on upgrading it!personally, i've never, in 2 years, experienced game lag unless it was my own connection playing up. even during peak times doin lvl4s in motsu.an <<<<<expansion>>>>> should <<<<<expand>>>>> the game with cool new stuff for everyone (maybe new mission storys) not >>>>>deflate<<<<<< it!and tbh i was really looking forward to tyrannis, and i too was totally ""deflated!"""
6/2/2010,mission fixes.not nerfs.
6/2/2010,"you, sir, are an idiot"
6/2/2010,fyp
6/2/2010,"btw, can you stop putting links to dodgy virus type websites in all the forums please, thankyou"
6/2/2010,what nerfs? you mean the reduction in t1 drops for named that were wrecking the most accessible part of the manufacturing industry while also playing havoc in the mining industry? the overall loss of isk/hour from the profession that involves the least risk and is the single biggest contributor to inflation?sounds like a readjustment to me.
6/2/2010,no he is talking about the load leveling change that was introduced that sends mission runners to low sec constantly as it automatically sends people to the least busy system within a certain radius(which is 4 jumps i believe). as it was i never ran into mission related lag either so why there was a load balancing system put in place no one really understands.i haven't messed with it yet so i have no opinion but from what people are saying its a joke how often you get sent to low sec. even worse is that farmers will simply pull a ton of missions and run them without finishing them over and over while holding up all the available missions in a system driving regular mission runners further and further away.
6/2/2010,"no, i'm talking about the ""adjustment"" made to where agents send you for missions, including lvl5s. i am limited to time i can spend on eve, i spent alot of time skilling and grinding isk to fly a solo lvl5 ship. they are hard enough without the delight of ganking lowsec pirates. i trained for it, why can't i reap the profits. if anything, why not reduce the rewards of hisec lvl5s, or make harder lvl4s with better rewards? not make it impossible for those that relied on them.so, no hisec lvl5s = no income = no plex = no playfine to those that can spend all day grindingbut hey, nvm!"
6/2/2010,"i can understand your frustration but eve isn't a grind game, it's a sandbox game. i admit i did run lvl4's for 6 months solid believing that this is the best way to make is, but the high numbers in highsec and the emptyness of lowsec (10 systems jumping, hours ratting 3 people showing up...). once i realized that lowsec and nullsec weren't as 'scary' as i had led myself to believe, i had much more fun hanging out with my friends and defending my own little section of the galaxy.eve is a social game and missions can reap great rewards, but the 'nerf' as you say only makes other professions more appealing, spread your horizons a bit, your skills could be greatly utilized in a lowsec pvp corp or a nullsec alliance. make friends and take risks, you might actually end up in a place you like better than where you are now.i fully support nullsec operations and tbh i've lost less ships in low/nullsec than i have to gankers in highsec. htfu and do something different.just my 2 isk, not that its worth much...midnight pheonix"
6/2/2010,i have played the game by running missions casually for 6 years now and you are telling me i have been doing it wrong all this time!!!!
6/2/2010,since a sandbox game by definition is a game where you do what you want if he wants to grind that's sandbox.

6/2/2010,"tl;dr: t1 industrials are boring. let's differentiate them!long version:t1 industrial ships can be made much more interesting if we create a few ""classes"" for them, each with a different role. since there are 5 levels of the racial industrial skills, let's make five classes! each race should assign a different skill level requirement to each class, but the basic class and huge class should always be skill level 1 and 5 respectively.all ships get +5% cargo per level of racial industrial in addition to the class-specific bonus listed below.basic class: low agility, low defense, medium cargo (25k m3 max); +5% velocity/leveltank class: low agility, high defense (battlecruiser level), medium cargo (20k m3 max); +5% shield/armor resist/levelfast class: high agility (frigate level), low defense, low cargo (10k m3 max), enough pg for mwd; +5% agility/levelhuge class: low agility, low defense, huge cargo (<50k m3 max); +5% cargo/level (so a total of +10%/level)wildcard class: specific to each race.minmatar wildcard: +20% tractor beam range/level, with 8 high slotscaldari wildcard: +5% scan strength/levelamarr wildcard: designed for combat, with tank and gank equivalent to t1 cruisergallente wildcard: +25mb drone bandwidth/level, +25m3 done bay/leveleven if you don't like every one of these ideas, i think that t1 industrials could be made a lot more interesting than they are now."
6/2/2010,"i can see that industrials need to be looked at. the fact that amarr have only two t1 industrials and both have the skill requirement at 1 is interesting, as is the caldari ones that don't have much cargo capacity.however, the wildcard suggestions are completely improbable. the minmatar one would be a destroyer on steroids, and everybody would want one. amarr and gallente would be too easy to abuse (check this for evidence). and for caldari, why in the world would an industrial need scan strength?!?industrials need to become more balanced, but your idea is rediculous. not supported."
6/2/2010,"i think the fact that the wildcards would all have terrible tank and agility would prevent them from becoming unbalanced, but they would be interesting! but anyway, does an idea have to be perfect to get support? the main point is that industrials need to be more interesting."
6/2/2010,i'm going to call it now. this idea is terrible.
6/2/2010,"a change to industrials would be good, but your changes need work as well.supporting the thought, not the solution"
6/2/2010,/signedif these are indeed minor changes (they seem to be) then they should at least lie in the todo-pile.
6/2/2010,supported - and yes to anti aliasing.we should also have ships explode in hull-crunching detail too.
6/2/2010,"do you think ccp actually has a to-do list? like, do they have a pool of issues that they can choose to work on, or do they just do whatever?"
6/2/2010,"oh, im sure they have a ""to do"" list... its probably just burried under the piles of massive expansions like dust, and incarna."
6/2/2010,"i have a topic up on the ideas and suggestions forums concerning destroyers, it has become evident why balancing destroyers is a such a pain."

6/2/2010,"so your telling me that the csm has had this lengthy list of issues that needed fixing, and that they've already found a solution for, but yet it has not been plugged in, and yet with the last 2 expansions they haven't put anything else in terms of fixes that really make a difference........um maybe the **** you've already found the solution for should be implemented, seriously"
6/2/2010,"tyrannis has been deployed and there are a lot of issues that are coming up. the forums are abuzz of problems that need to be checked and must be fixed before you even consider working on the next expansion.1. new node crash / desync issues.2. memory problems with eve and sever communication problems3. pi balancing and phasing out of npc products.4. long standing balancing issues t3 drone bays, 5th subsystem, and af5. cyno effects!!!!!!!!1111one!6. eve gate issues.there are a lot of problems so forget about the expansion until these are hammered out. instead of breaking ccp into teams, put everyone together and work on these problems 1 at a time. yes i know a lot of people are out of the loop but you can bring them up to speed really fast.tl;dr postpone work on new expansion until #1-4 have been addressed and deployed. and focus all dev resources on fixing the current issues.ok standard rules apply in my threads, no flaming, please offer good constructive feed back, and use proper grammar. if you have noticed ccp responds more to good constructive feedback rather than whine. if i missed a key issue, please add it and i will modify the op."
6/2/2010,theres alrdy a huge as post about this:
6/2/2010,"having read the patch notes very carefully for tyrannis, i notice a fair number of missing changes.two simple examples:- overview distance right justified instead of left justified.- loss of t2 markings from ships in hangars and items in cargo/containers/whatever.since these are not in the patch notes, there can be only two reasons.one, they were deemed too low detail to bother with.two, someone made changes to code without logging nor clearing it.now, given some of the other low level trivial changes in the patch notes, i really doubt number one. so imho (not so humble, i am a software designer with 25 years experience), ccp has a programmer/programmer management issue, both in making sure people record the changes they make, and that these changes are reviewed.if changes are made, but not tracked, then they cannot be tested. because, no one knows to test them.if changes are made, but not tracked, then no one can review the implications of said changes and possible ramifications and side effects.quality does not come easily or quickly. and if you do not put the effort in up front, you end up putting in much more effort later attempting to recover the damage.i end up putting this in a forum post, with a small hope that some of the people who need to change will see this."

6/2/2010,"i'm noticing a trend here, as well."
6/2/2010,scandalincest? ************? or your average political scene?
6/2/2010,"gratz to ankh.and gratz to her so called ""opponents"" for the pathetic smear campaign that could make one wonder about their intellectual capabilities. in fact being so pathetic, that one can only start to think that the ""opponents"" in fact are supporters running a clever contra-support campaign.i any case, a vote for ankh seems to have been a kick in the nuts for some of the egomaniacs around here, and that can only be seen as a good thing."
6/2/2010,"you started a new thread so you could get the old one locked because people weren't being sycophantic enough okay, well here goes, again-ankh lied to her electorate and resorted to evemail and trade hub local spam in order to panic highsec voters into electing her. the views she holds of this game are biased to the extreme both against particular playstyles and the individuals that practice them- whom she considers to have mental deficiencies in real life.here are some choice quotes exposing here views on eve and the people that play it, taken verboten."
6/2/2010,this! i don't think most of the so called carebears would subscribe to these view points tbh.
6/2/2010,"every ankh thread is an anti-ankh thread.but, any publicity is good publicity.and, all the anti-ankh statements are just quotes of ankh.i feel a division by zero coming on."
6/2/2010,"first of all, thank you for posting something more concrete than the usual ""ank is the end of eve as we know it"" fare... :)again, quotes taken out of context. (from what i can tell, all from this thread, for those who would like to follow along.) i'll only address the first quote you listed for now, since that is the only one that i can believe anyone would take as an actual literal proposal, rather than simply being her opinion.so, if you read everything she says surrounding that one quote, it doesn't seem to me that she was seriously suggesting what you quoted. the other quotes you listed are, in my opinion, not proposals. if she wants to rp about how much she hates pirates, more power to her. it's no worse than some of the anti-carebear smack aimed at her and others. and, if people want to ***** about it, more power to them, too. personally, i prefer to look at the policies she actually wants to implement. i think it's far more constructive.as far as lying to her electorate? i'm not sure to what lies you're referring, so you'll have to elaborate on that.i'd also like to point out that this is from 2008. if you read some of her more recent campaigning, you may agree with me that she's much better at articulating her ideas now. many of the ideas themselves are the same, i just feel like she's better at getting her points across now."
6/2/2010,i believe the lie he was referring to was the spam in jita and elsewhere that all the other csm candidates wanted to move level 4s to lowsec.
6/2/2010,"i'm pleased to see others voicing their open and welcoming attitude to ank and her views. and like localhorse, picking apart the pathetic arguments made by pirate's during and after their smear and fear-mongering campaign. it is quite common for vocal groups to garner attention because squeaky wheels get grease. and by eye-balling the forums, there seems little doubt that the whines of pirates dominated the last campaign. that should not be mistaken for broad-based support. reasonable people often sit on the sidelines, and do not speak what is on their minds (a side-debate about democratic participation....). more importantly, it bespeaks the fear of pirates that their privileged protections in eve may eventually come to an end. 'i think you protest too much' (to paraphrase the bard). now like localhorse, i don't necessarily agree with everything ank or the other take care party representatives have proposed. but i do see in these proposals an honest attempt to optimize eve for *all* its players. i also see other candidates like diedra vaal (a fellow uni) who are willing to do the same. theirs is a far more reasonable and honest approach than the deflections, obfuscations, fabrications and overt self-interest of those representing pirates. so a challenge to our pirating curs -- let us hear some reasonable proposals from you about improving eve for all its citizens, and not just your own group. you can make a start by actually reading the proposals made by ank and kin on the csm wiki, and responding to those in a constructive manner. i and my mates will gladly discuss and support proposals that really do benefit eve as a whole. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.comps. actually, this isn't a new thread started by ank in order to lock the other. the 'congratulations' thread was moved from crime and punishment by a gm who didn't understand the context or sardonic nature of the post. it was then locked by another gm in jita park for being duplicative of 'congratulations ank'. no big deal. honest mistakes happen, and we shall carry on from here."
6/2/2010,"fearmongering like spreading false horror tales about the views of other csm candidates?i'll support decent proposals by ankh. she's made one or two. but i really can't respect someone who refers to an entire subset of players (who grasp the point of eve far better than she does) as psychopathic virgins, merely because she doesn't like what they do."
6/2/2010,ankh is the sarah palin of eve.
6/2/2010,with all redeeming features removed.
6/2/2010,"see locked thread below to view the outcome of this one, also stop posting the same **** over and over again."
6/2/2010,"once again, the actual quote, in context: she was responding to that very same accusation towards herself. and it was directed towards a very specific character, for a very specific reason. if someone said that to me, i might respond in a similar manner. i'm sure a lot of us would have.as for the alleged local spam and lies, i haven't seen any of it. i wasn't around for her campaigning in local. now, i realize there's no real way to prove one way or another what was said, but can someone please post some examples of the behavior in question?frankly, i don't know what was said. but considering that after doing some research, most if not all of the negative characterizations i've read of ank have proved to be unfounded... well, you can imagine why i'm skeptical of these claims."

6/2/2010,"iirc: doesn't ccp have the final say in suggestions getting implemented?i'm pretty sure they wouldn't seriously change one of the major aspects that makes eve unique from other games: lawless space means lawless space. you can make it by lying, stealing, cheating and conniving other people out of their isk, ships, ore, or other items, if you have the charisma, cunning, intellect, muscle, and most importantly, the balls of steel to do so."
6/2/2010,"yup, and congrats to mynxee. i honestly almost voted for her.exactly, marsuga. and no one, least of all me, is suggesting that this be changed. that's my whole point. everyone claims that ank is anti-pvp. this is patently false. some of her suggestions would even encourage more pvp."

6/3/2010,"i think the whole security status thing needs to be looked at. basic insurance needs to be taken out entirely. if you didn't buy insurance, you don't get a payout at all. taking away a minimal insurance payment isn't likely going to help anything by itself when the suicide ganker is likely just an alt of an already rich player. they don't do it for the profit, they do it for the lulz anyway. but yes, i also think it's silly that you get insurance payout (even if you paid for the insurance) if you are killed as an outlaw at all, much less killed by the authorities.concord should be changed to simply being an additional police force with multi-system/region jurisdiction. mortal, so they can be avoided but still powerful and with a longer memory (24hours?) for anyone aggressing towards another player. stronger and more ships in higher sec systems. gives pirates more things to do with their d-scanner as they will remain hunted as long as they are in concord controlled space of any security status.i would also change this chart from:players with -2.0 or worse will be attacked in 1.0 systemsplayers with -2.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.9 systemsplayers with -3.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.8 systemsplayers with -3.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.7 systemsplayers with -4.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.6 systemsplayers with -4.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.5 systemsto:players with <0.0 or worse will be attacked in 1.0 systemsplayers with -1.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.9 systemsplayers with -2.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.8 systemsplayers with -3.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.7 systemsplayers with -4.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.6 systemsplayers with -4.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.5 systemsi would also alter ""once your security status reaches -5 you are considered an outlaw and can be attacked by players anywhere without concord intervention."" so that people with outlaw security status via the prior chart are free game to anyone without concord intevention and without the risk of a security hit. that would actually make for anti-pirate activity to be worthwhile for players in hi-sec.suicide ganking is only effective because nobody can attack the pirate unless they attack someone first and even then, the only person who can attack the pirate is the person who is getting attacked and the pirate has already decided that they are likely to win so that there really is limited risk."
6/3/2010,"problems:1) fw occupancy usually has little to do with pvp. pvp and occupancy are often very different types of activity. or put differently fw occupancy involves too much pve and not enough pvp.2) fw pvp too often consists attacking someone and then getting blobbed.3) too much time is spent shipping up or down.4) too much time is spent looking for a similar sized gang you may want to engage as opposed to run from or that will just run from you. solution:1) remove npcs from occupancy related plexes. npcs in the plexes ruin it. who wants to fight with your ability to win gimped by some intangible amount of rat dps and ewar from rats? its lame fighting when you are under fire and ewar from npcs. really i dont want npcs whoring my killmails anyway. 2) inform militias when players enter plexes! when someone from fw enters a complex gate all militias should know who entered, where, ship types and the plex type. this is intel that should just be provided via a separate chat channel. after all if a system is contested that means both sides likely have npc spies there giving info. (here i do not mean player spies but npc militia spies that will post in the channel but they do not fly around in ships. they are more like bureaucratic spies. the only way their presence would be known in game is they would post in the plex intel chat channel) this way the players could get a gang out there to fight the enemy pvp gang before the plex runs. no npcs in the fight. instead information about where you can find pvp! 3) have more plexes pop up through out the regions and throughout the day not just down time. 4) dont require scanners just have the plexes appear.comments:if ccp made those two changes i think plexing would make fw the absolute best pvp mechanic in the game. will it solve everything? no but it will, i believe substantially cut down on the problems i listed above.i would point out 3) plexes shouldnt mainly spawn at downtime. they should be spawning throughout the day and frequently. i thought the csm already recommended this to ccp  though i could be wrong.how will this make plexing more of a pvp activity? by removing the npcs people will fit their ships for pvp. there will be no trade offs that need to be made for dealing with the various rats. fit your ship for pvp and go capture systems. wont this lead to people just flying noob ships in plexs? that is where the second change comes in. currently if you are going to do plexes the most effective way is to get in a small ship that can tank the npcs and hope the timer runs before the enemy knows your even there. the current mechanics make this the smart way to plex. however with the proposed changes the other militia will know where you are and likely come to kill you. so if you are not prepared to fight chances are you will get chased out before the timer is up. the entire enemy will be put on notice as to where you are and what you are flying. so your chance of holding the plex depends on your pvp power instead of your pve prowess.comments continued....edit: added some ideas to deal with ecm problems that this system may create: see page 3 post 64."
6/3/2010,"continued from op....how will this reduce blobs? well im not sure it will reduce actual blobs but it will reduce their impact on the game in at least 3 ways: 1) it will make it easier to avoid getting blobbed. currently since most of the pvp occurs in the system you can have a bait ship and then as soon as someone engages the bait you can have a fleet warp right on top of them. here you will be in a plex. so if people try to warp to you they will not warp directly on top of you they will warp to the gate. now you can decide to engage the enemy as far from or close to the gate as you like. if you engage say 90km off the gate. then you will 1st see local spike. the blob will have to warp to the gate. jump through the gate and then try to burn out to you. this will give you time to either kill a few of the enemy or try to get away. if the blob jumps in with sniper fits they may not need to burn out to you (they can start shooting right at the gate) but they will be quite vulnerable if you have some close range reinforcements coming. 2) if the enemy is flying around in one big blob then you can spread out and take plexes far from where the blob is. moreover if the enemy just tries to stay in one big gang chasing individual plexers they may get trapped by an enemy blob. from an occupancy stand point though it would be better to break up the blob into 5 groups taking plexes though out the fw area than it would to have one big blob lumbering around capturing none of the plexes and trying to chase plexers away and likely getting no kills in the process. 3) the plexes are already size limited. so if you bring 30 battleships to chase away 3 destroyers and 3 frigates doing a minor plex you wont get in. the size of the gang has to be able to get into the plexes. hence, other than major plexes, the blob warfare as we know it wont work. how will this reduce the time it takes shipping up or down? well the intel channel *tells* you the size of the fleet you are to deal with. so it will greatly speed this up.how will this reduce the time you spend roaming looking for a like sized gang? well the intel channel *tells* you where they are and the type of gang they have. so the problem is about as solved as possible.will there be a fleet in system waiting on the gate even though only a few are in doing the plex? sure thats possible. you still need to scout. but thats not so bad.does this mean the larger and more powerful militia will win occupancy? yeah i think it does. but thats the way it should work."

6/3/2010,"i support the subject, agree with the points made in the op, ccp can do better, and should be. the csm is a system to give hope to customers in that their voice might be heard and acted upon, but seriously does anyone really think that ccp has changed development priorities to address any idea, or subject? when i read that you have some hope that the csm will change anything i feel bad as it will never happen unless it was something already planned to be done. i give ccp credit it's a good trick.look at this product from ccp's point of view, eve as a test bed technology for the world of darkness (wod) product at this point, and has been for the past 3 years, they hit the revenue ceiling on eve after the introduction of the gtc system, the box product did nothing at retail, and steam also gave it a small rise, but it's a hardcore product for very hardcore people, and was designed that way to it's core. with the knowledge, and experience they have gained from running eve if this is applied to wod in design and the systems they might hit the goal of 120k people online on a single server, 2 mil subscriptions, eve will never hit these numbers in any period of time that is relevant to them, so they have to hope to grow the company with new products. eve's core design prevent the changes to hit these numbers so we are relegated to either to having them change the core game-play which they will never do as the risk is too high, or improving what we have already and living with the limitations of the nature of this game.all this being said, they can still improve eve and should, the over promise and under deliver method has become their standard practice, this repetitive failure cycle will continue unless they get focused on eve again, my fear or expectation is that they keep eve on life support tossing us bones, using us as paying testers for technology dedicated for wod, and then dump eve once wod ships."

6/3/2010,"i can remember the joy i felt when the first rumblings of this game started to pop up on the internet. it gave me the hope of finally being able to play an elite style game as a mmo. to some extent, that has dream has been fulfilled (although, i am still waiting to be able to fly across the landscape of a planet). i have been attached to this game since beta and still love the concept of eve. however, it seems to me that quality has fallen to the way side in favor of a fast development schedule over the last couple of years. don't get me wrong. i like having significant updates every 6 months. however, i have to agree with the majority here--there must be some form of development in the direction of the older content. i just don't think that it will be possible without some increase in development personnel specifically allocated to this endeavor. between the development of other projects and the upcoming dust release there simply is not time for anything else. their plate is full my friends.what ccp must ask themselves is, ""do we love eve?"" if the answer is yes, then they need to gather up the team and really attempt to identify the most nagging issues with their beloved game. they should make a true effort to illicit the feedback of the community on those specific topics and then tackle the problems most important to them (as the loving creators) and us (the loving players) and call it a release. i don't know about anyone else. but i would be more than happy with a once a year major release followed a minor release that contains at least a few significant fixes to older content. i know that new releases drive new subscriptions and even sometimes pull old players back to the game. i know its a money thing. everyone wants to make money. it's an acceptable endeavor. however, just as the original post suggests, is it worth being less than excellent? is it worth being less than your potential? in the beginning, there was this small and obscure game developer named ccp. they were mavericks armed with the dream of creating something unique that broke the mold of what a mmo can be. i want to believe those mavericks still exist. i want to believe that dream is still alive. i want to believe that this little game, that was considered by many to be far to ambitious to succeed, is still loved by its creators. we, the eve community, love this game. we, the eve community, prove our love everyday with our incessant whining. if we didn't care so much we would simply move on to another game. but we don't. we continue to come back, day after day, to experience something that can't be found anywhere else. we do so with the hope that this game, out of the many, will live up to its potential and that it will continue to be what other games strive to become. so please, ccp, show us what you've got."

6/3/2010,"give me a client update once every couple weeks where two or three of the most currently annoying bugs are fixed. make it a regular process. then i'd be happy. fixing bugs doesn't have to wait for expansions or other contrived anniversary dates. if it's a huge architectural change, sure, waiting for an expansion may be the best course of action. but if it's just fixing up the ui or patching some server-side logic, make it happen. don't make us wait."
6/3/2010,"i'm so glad this proposal is getting that much support by the player base. in the past 7 years, eve has grown to be a beast with a billion heads and the more it expands, the harder and more time consuming it becomes to keep it at bay.when you grow, you're inevitably facing issues such as scalability, small bugs that really love to hide in dark corners and of course the users cause as a rule, no matter how well you build something, there will be one user who will do something excruciatingly stupid and break it.as such, ccp can be proactive into creating excellence up to a certain degree. i hope nobody is having illusions that such a massive product will be excellent on day 0. when it is unleashed to the pesticide holding horde of the player base, bugs will come out of their nests. i think ccp's focus should be switched into retroactively pushing things into excellence, based hugely on user feedback, on a steady and frequent basis.since we're heavy into latin words for expansions lately, how about the next expansion name being ""restituo pro excellentia"" ?as such, i fully support this notion.ps: i am very content that during this csm we had a record setting vote turnout. it so seems that more and more people feel the need to voice their concerns to ccp. i just hope that the csm will grow to be a force to be reckoned."

6/3/2010,"don't like them, don't train them. stop being so obsessed with other characters skillpoints. for the one millionth time, doing any given activity, or flying any given ship, you are only using a relatively small subset of sp. any and all sp not related to that activity is wholly irrelevant. why does it grate on you that one player gets there in 30 days, when it took you 32? players are measured on their knowledge of game mechanics, and their ability to put them to use. you do not need n sp in x amount of time to do this. there is no trophy for reaching a specific number in the least amount of time. a player with faster training times might acquire the ability to perform one mini profession or related group of level v skills in a year. in any case, high learning skills take progressively longer to pay off, since you could have been training a direct game related skill during that time. somebody somewhere made a chart covering this, which i can't be arsed to find."
6/3/2010,"it has nothing to do with comparing other players, it has to do with being able to acheive your own train goals faster. you should consider that this is also part of the games mechanics unfortunately. as such training well is also important to a lot of people.the trophy is that a person can get into what they want that much sooner and fly it well that much sooner. not everyone wants to fly frigs for the rest of eve. it has nothing at all to do with characters comparing sp sizes."

6/3/2010,"the jump clone timer is now 24 hours, which means that if a player wants to do both his pvp stuff in one part of the galaxy and then some light mining or something later on, he effectively destroys the next day. in effect, this means you cannot clonejump because you will miss the fleets the next day, and so you log off instead. i don't see any reason why the timer has to be so long. 2-4 hours would be sufficient to cover any pvp-abusable aspects of clonejumping. even 12 hours would be enough, you could do two things every day.thank you for your time,++wenoc"
6/3/2010,in the massively multiplayer online role playing game known as eve online there are things called space-ships which you can use to fly through space in order to move between two distant points. i hope this was informative.
6/3/2010,i think 2-4 hours is too much. lets people easily escape gate/station camps and bring reinforcement ship from behind. 12 hour is what i would like to have
6/3/2010,"not supported (just as the last 100times).if you want to get from a to b before the timer, either fly over or pod express."
6/3/2010,i'd support 12 hours happily.
6/3/2010,eve is small enough without making cross-cluster travel even easier than it already is.
6/3/2010,leave it as is or tbh id rather it be extended to 48hrs
6/3/2010,"this words it better than i could, but i did have this in mind; from an rp standpoint, it only makes sense that if there are hundreds of missions being run for an agent per day, the quality and payout of those missions will be lower.from a gameplay standpoint the main problem this solves is how easy and risk-free mission running is; instead of just going to dodixie or mostu or <mission hub> they'll actually have to look for the highest-quality agent of the day/week, or they might even decide that it's worth it to grind for aliastra or some other obscure corp rather than sticking with fed navy. lowsec agents getting a boost and some incentive to run missions next to lowsec are just pleasant side effects."
6/3/2010,"the dynamic quality increase would, i think, make it more attractive for small gangs. a mix of pvp and pve ships would have incentive to run a low-sec mission.the pvp pilots, it might be assumed, could be more experienced and better skilled, while the pve pilots are less skilled in pvp but adequate to the task for the mission.as a gang, the pve pilots can have time to learn how things work in low sec without the expectation (real or imagined) that they will immediately lose ships and, possibly, wind up in the clone tank.with higher rewards to the gang, the incentive is there for the veterans in a corp to teach practical skills to newer or more cautious pilots.i fly with pilots who have patiently taught me the basics of surviving and profiting from living in a w/h. as long as the cost/benefit of low sec is so awful..... <shrug>..... to hell with low sec!a good step in the right direction.supported."
6/3/2010,"half supported.always been a great fan of dynamic agent quality, (although iirc ccp said they wont do it). however with one but, no or only limitted dynamic quality in low sec and 0.0. imo there is no need to lower quality of the few semi mission hubs outside high sec when they are popular, the pirates will take care of that already. so either fixed quality, or only swing in quality between 0 and 20 for example. (and then also get rid of all the q-20 agents in low sec)."
6/3/2010,"i agree with you that low quality agents shouldn't exist in lowsec, but i think it would be simpler from a game design standpoint to just have all agents behave in the same way regarding quality.i think a better way to achieve what you're looking for is to 1: change the agent's quality by 1 or -1 on any given ""cycle"", where a cycle can be anywhere from a day to a week. thus if it were every day, taking a lowsec agent from 20 to 0 would take heavy usage for 3 weeks straight, which would no doubt attract a lot of attention.i feel that changes happening slowly is an important part of the system; if an agent was 15 one day and -15 the next, it would become very frustrating to run missions.2: the threshold required to bring an agent's quality up or down isn't one single number; it's based on the current quality. so the threshold for a q20 agent might be 15 missions per day, but for q15 it might be 60 missions per day. for 0, it might be in the 200-300 range. i really don't know what kind of numbers the main mission hub agents pull in terms of missions per day so i'll leave the exact numbers up to the experts, but again, under my proposed system, it would require people running 200 missions a day for 3 weeks straight. that just won't happen in lowsec, so your fears of a negatve quality lowsec agent will never occur."
6/3/2010,"this change would just cause people to move in high sec a bit more. talking about lp is pointless because the popular corps are already in that department. the more people run missions for a corp, the more abundant the items in their lp store will become and the prices will drop. switching from one corp to another isn't a problem, because no standings grinding is required thanks to faction standings. even if someone didn't have the standings yet, they could just do the cosmos missions.people still won't move to lowsec because the risk simply isn't worth the risk. at least not if you want to use the same fit as in high sec. you're asking for soft targets to move to lowsec, but that simply won't happen. if people want isk, they'll go to highsec, nullsec or wormholes. compared to those areas lowsec is just risk without isk. if you want people to move to lowsec, you'll have to give them something unique, something they can't get anywhere else. in its current this is just a nerf l4 missions thread that has pretty much nothing to do with lowsec."
6/3/2010,"i like the idea of agent quality being 'market' driven, but i don't think it would in anyway encourage more players to low-sec systems.l4 profits are driven by ship bounties rather than mission rewards."
6/3/2010,"not sure how often you go to lowsec, but only the border systems result in the instant death that you seem to fear will come about. the same absence of people that makes 0.0 mission running relatively safe makes many deep lowsec areas relatively safe, so the further out you go, the less risk there really is.this may be true, but the obvious answer is to make the quality affect bounties as well. quality 0 missions will have rats with the current ""base"" bounties, and each increment up/down in quality will add/subreact something like 1.5% from the bounty. a 1m isk battleship would become a 700k isk battleship at q-20, and a 1.3m isk battleship at q20."
6/3/2010,"i don't think this goes far enough, but it's a step in the right direction. perhaps if bounties were reduced and agent rewards were increased this would have more impact."
6/3/2010,i like it
6/3/2010,"supported, would help spread people out not just agent wise but also empire wise, ie no more 3/4 of playerbase running caldari missions."
6/3/2010,sounds sensible
6/3/2010,i like it. i don't think it would do jack **** to the population in low sec but it's still a good idea.
6/3/2010,"oh u mean these rules: the selected item will be insured while in your possession for the duration of the contract. repackaging the item will void the contract. the contract will be considered void if the item or ship is destroyed while being in the possession of somebody else. do you accept the above terms and still want to insure the selected item?in case u haven't figured it out yet, it's basically an incentive to use and lose your ship for whatever purpose u deem fit. what part of that do u not understand? oh and if u wanted it to be like wow, u'd be asking for separate blue zones that r 100% safe to operate in (just like in wow)...oh wait... u're pretty much doing that 'cause why else would u completely ignore the clearly written rule that cannot ever be turned off so it pops up every time u insure? well, other than u wanting to stay safe and sound with wow in space, that is..."
6/3/2010,"itt: people just not getting the basic principle that it's not wrong to suicide gank. it's not an exploit. it's not cheating. it's not griefing. it's legitimate, supported play, with no particular reason to discourage it any more than piracy, missioning, fleet fights, ratting, scouting or any of the other ways of losing a ship that no rl insurance company would ever dream of paying out for.as the poster above has correctly stated, eve ""insurance"" is nothing more than a (partial) ship replacement mechanism designed to encourage people to go and and fight with them - in ways criminal, foolish or just plain mad. the only thing eve ""insurance"" has in common with real world insurance is the name. given that, and given that suicide ganking is a supported play, there is no reason whatsoever to remove it from suicide gankers any more than there is a reason to remove it from someone who engages versus 10:1 odds.tl;dr: stop getting hung up on the word ""insurance. it's an analogy at best for the way that pend work. op's proposal is not supported."
6/3/2010,there is plenty of reason to remove insurance from ships that suicide gank.this may blow some peoples minds but truthfully there is little to no risk for suicide ganking.the loss of sec status? can be npc'd back within a few hours if you know what you are doing.the small loss of isk? can easily be regained after a couple of hours of npcing. (and thats if you really care since if you are suciding ganking something likely you have made this isk in your kills loot many times over)and you know you can do these both at the same time.what i feel is necessary is for there to be a true balance between risk/reward throughout eve. there is no reason why you get your insurance isk back after you have just been killed by concord.
6/3/2010,"i disagree; i don't think thats going far enough.i think that concord should send you a mail after you get ganked asking how much you want the ganker to pay you. you put in a number, and it removes isk from their wallet and into yours.if there isnt enough, it sells off their assets to the highest sell order available until it reaches that number.if its still not high enough it makes a post in the character bizarre to see if anyone wants to buy the character.if thats still not enough they send the police to round the person up in real life and take him to small claims court.maybe then this game will finally be safe for idiots like me to afk with 6 bil in my t1 cargo"
6/3/2010,"fully support insurance not paying when you get concorded, and i say that as someone who's corpmates suicide gank fairly often. it just feels too easy at the moment. the other emo whining in here though makes me want to not support it, just because i dont want to feel like i have anything in common with these people."
6/3/2010,supported.enhance this with a standing loss for using cargo or ship scanners in high-sec. thanx.
6/3/2010,"the risk/reward argument is based on the totally fallacious idea that people deserve to be safe while being careless in hi-sec. the only thing that they have a right to expect is that unprovoked aggression will - eventually - cost the aggressor his ship. nothing more. ccp have re-affirmed this over and over again.if people choose to move valuables in poorly tanked afk ships, then of course it's going to be easy to gank them. that's no reason to whine to ccp to punish those who take advantage of their carelessness. it's not up to ccp to decrease rewards vs those who play poorly."
6/3/2010,"ehh...not supported. hesitant to fall into the 'rl' trap. concorded folks already take a sec hit, and the new insurance model will most likely inflict more pain on the suicidal types. if you want safe, stay docked."
6/3/2010,"against.freedom requires responsibility.too much control is not freedom.if you fly the route frequently, make somebookmarks real close to the stations/gates,and warp to zero."
6/3/2010,don't you just love the pirating curs' version of risk/reward -- your risk and their reward? delilah
6/3/2010,"lol, the way it is now, there is no 'high' security. i guess none of you remember when ccp placed the tax on npc corps, they said it was to make eve more like 'real life' and the enticement to join or create a player corp was that it could be 'tax free'.we all live in areas that have a high, low and no (null) security.so to make eve more like 'real life', eve = country, state, city, etc.high security = financial, industrial, etc.low security = commercial, residential, etc.null security = rural, undeveloped, etc.in high security area:must have positive security status. not allowed to carry/have weapons. immediate response by authorities for crime committed.in low security area:must have either high or low security status.can carry/have weapons.slow response by authorities for crime committed.in null security area:can have either high, low or bad security status.encouraged to carry/have weapons.no response by authorities for crime committed.having said all of that and if ccp is trying to use 'real life' as excuse for making changes, well, let's go all the way with it.i endorse this 100%."
6/3/2010,allthough i don't agree with insurance payouts on ppl who have been concorded i do want it to be viable to suicide gank in hi-sec.i want to see how the way the new insurance works out over the next few months before i give this my support or not.
6/3/2010,lets face it eve insurance is not a real business model. the insurance companies would all go bankrupt whether we count ships blown up by concord or not. if you want to play the real life card ask yourself this. what are the chances you will get insurance if you were to tell your agent that you are going to attach guns and missile launchers to your car and drive around with a bunch of other likeminded people as we all shoot at eachother? mkay. insurance in eve is still a good thing because it supports one of the funnest activities the game offers - pvp.personally i think high sec is already too safe. traders need some risk.
6/3/2010,"in after the ""me me me"" brigade sounding off. seriously, do you guys realise how ridiculous you sound? ""i'm not making as many isks now as i was, and i might have to go into mean nasty horribad lowsecs, therefore this change should be rolled back!""has it occurred to you selfish whiners that your mission running has effects on the wider game beyond your own wallet? that while it may have nerfed your highsec level 5s (and your cynical use of high quality l4 agents in 0.5 systems on lowsec borders), the broader impact on the risk:reward calculus is obviously more in line with how ccp see missions should be balanced?either move further into highsec and take a quality hit, or deal with the fact that you've been struck by a nerf bat. the self-righteous forum whining is pathetic."
6/3/2010,thanks ankh...umm...pmkahsomething. +1
6/3/2010,"not supported, in its current form ank. pre-dominion the ratio was about right between highsec agents sending players to lowsec, allowing them to decline missions if they felt like it, or taking the mission and the risk. since dominion the ratios have been broken. in dominion, a really low amount of missions where in lowsec. now, in taranis, ccp over compensated."
6/3/2010,"i'm not really sure there was such a great need to introduce/change load-balancing to send people to the neighboring system with only 5 people in instead of the current system with 10 people.although i must admit i haven't run a mission in one of the ""big hubs"" for quite some time.overall i find this proposal lacking of a specific solution or the presented solution is just not detailed enough:will highsec agents still prefer the system 4 jumps away just because there is 1 pilot less in it?lowsec agents sending you to their system most of the time will create ""minihubs"" in lowsec, very predictable."
6/3/2010,endorsed 100%
6/3/2010,bump!
6/3/2010,supported! tho i'm having a dejavu with the proposal...
6/3/2010,this issue has already been proposed to csm:
6/3/2010,assembly hall -> [proposal] make on-grid bookmarks visible in space.
6/3/2010,remove all low sec offers from high sec agents.are ccp crazy? do they expect high sec mission runners to accept a courier mission to low sec for 185k isk? yeah right! do they expect me to lose my ship and cargo which cant be bought from the market and my pod which could cost hundreds of millions for 185k isk?no chance!there is no reason to expect a high sec mission runner to travel to low security space at all. there is no way i am going to do that.i understand the mission loot table changes which are tolerated even though they are not welcome but seriously low sec missions for 185k isk? this isnt right.they must go.
6/3/2010,decline the mission.
6/3/2010,"decline it for crying out loud. why do you feel it's owed to you to run safe and easy missions non-stop from one agent? if you absolutely desire to never go into lowsec, get yourself a group of agents close together. it might take a little bit of lower level missioning to get the standings. you can then decline to your hearts content. it's likely you'll not have to decline a second time within the time window, if you've got 3 agents or so. besides, doing 2 declines doesn't result in that big of a standing loss. if you've already got a 7+ with the agent, you can decline a bunch of missions.what? this is your feeling, not reasoning. lowsec is still empire, and the relevant corp has stations and interests there. wouldn't they trust their ""can-do"" pod pilot who's taken on half of mordu's legion by himself to take care of such missions?then don't. problem solved.it does seem a bit off that security isn't factored into the payout (including going down in higher security), but once again...nobody is forcing you to go there."
6/3/2010,here's a better idea: make low-sec agents stop giving out high sec missions... really annoying me as when i ask for it in low-sec quite obviously i want it to be in low-sec. (or add more/distribute better lvl 4 and lvl 5 agents)afterall why should i get high sec missions i have no chance of doing due to concord/faction navy...
6/3/2010,actually that would be perfectly in keeping with what they did to l5 missions. after all you do get the better rewards for accepting a mission from a low sec agent why should you get that extra reward while still enjoying concord protection?
6/3/2010,declining the mission for me is the only option. i am a high sec mission runner and have been for some years now. at no point would i ever accept a mission in low sec. it wouldnt be so bad if the reward for taking a hauler to low sec was greater but seriously 185k isk?! no chance in a million years. 185 million isk perhaps but yeah as if thats going to happen.
6/3/2010,"well it does make sense. high sec missions should be in high sec. right? no one is going to low sec if there doing missions in high sec especially since there is a lot of added risk and no increased rewards. sure you can decline them, but whats the point of giving them out in the first place if no-one is going to do them?"
6/3/2010,"and yet the bitter old veterans still don't want people to have more sp, even though now the testimonial is that it makes you no better.it's really weird, so many people against it, and not a single one of them has a credible reason as to why. they either don't know why they don't want it, or don't want to say why they don't want it.and that is good enough reason to want it."
6/3/2010,"there is a massive difference between wanting to keep the n00bs underfoot, and not wanting this game to turn to a ****ty ""pay for advancement"" model that so, so many other mmos are headed toward at the moment. dust514 sadly included last i checked.real money should never enter into the equation for online gaming with the sole exception of your monthly subscription. the fact that plex exists supremely ****ed me off for the longest time, but i can understand how its a necessary evil for the sake of eve's economy.this suggestion takes eve down a path of mediocrity where the real-life rich will always be advancing faster than the little guy, even if you exclude the top 10% of the eve population.not supported."
6/3/2010,"i'll tell you exactly why i don't want it in no uncertain terms.ready? it should be based on your in game decisions, such as when to remap, what skills to train, which implants to fly with, what learning skills to train when, etc.unfortunately, however, i think we've reached the point where we'll just have to agree to disagree."
6/3/2010,"so basically despite introducing remapping, ccp now have the exact correct rate of sp game to keep every bitter old veteran happy? interesting.i think it was very clever of them to find the exact correct rate of sp gain to please everybody.please come up with some more plausible. one size fits all? pull the other one. something fishy going on here.to access more sp more quickly, why do i have to buy a character from a player from one of ccps customers instead of ccp?your answer doesn't address the existence of the character bazaar. thank you and goodnight. 1 to me, 0 to you.the foamer above you, he too, invented a fictious answer that forgets how much the character bazaar does the exact same thing.when inventing answers, at least try to cover all the bases.it's so strange.... they just can't answer it.... cannot, will not, which is it?why can't they answer such a simple question if they feel so strongly about it, why can my character that i wanted not be better with rl cash or isk, why does it have to be that i give isk to a veteran who gave rl cash to a character and why do i have to carry their character's baggage around with me?such a simple question. so simple even a bitter old veteran can't answer it."
6/3/2010,"gavjack, you were a terrible can flipper and you're an even worse debater. this idea sucks for many reasons, most of which have been laid out time and time again. this idea goes against the whole spirit of eve and would result in the game being half full of max sp players with the other half being made up of the poor new folk who cant afford to buy the plex's. you also make it so the older players just get all skills very quickly, and have nothing else to train for. way to kill the end game. :pif getting in a titan or carrier was as simple as having a big credit card balance then eve would have no more interest for many of us. why exactly should you ever catch up with someone who's invested 7 years into this game?oh and before you say it, no i'm not a bitter veteran player, i've got a whole 20.5m sp, and i still know this idea sucks."
6/3/2010,"i'm an awesome can flipper, you're just speaking on matters you don't know about.ahh... just to be clear, none of them have been pointed out, not even once.as i keep explaining, the things people are typing into their keyboards and calling reasons, aren't reasons against $4sp, they are reasons for something, not sure what though, doesn't matter what.again, look what you have done, the same error all those who came before you made, you forgot about the character bazaar. the character bazaar is where these mythical super rich players you like to pretend exist could buy their characters today! if they were going to. but yet, it's not happening is it? hmmmm.... would you like to address that point or foam some more?wrong again! skills are exponential and into the year long scales the excesses of infinite-isk bitter old veterans farting out titans at a rate of 1 a week are massively removed from the affairs of a month old pottering around hisec in hac. so yes your bitter old veteran will be infinite isk skilling his latest titan pilot at a huge rate, only 3 months instead of a year! but so will all the people he's up against... oh look, no problems.it already is. see character bazaar, dear oh dear, you can't get your head round the character bazaar can you?and therefore you loss of interest point loses credence too.equally, why shouldn't i catch up with somebody who has invested 7 years into this game? if we use your ""pro"" argumentative stance, i hereby invent the assertion that not letting people catch up makes us lose interest in eve. but! we don't want to use your ""pro"" argumentative stance, because we know it's riddled with errors.if it's just a simple case of protecting one's status as a ""senior resident of this street, and we like things exactly the way they are thank you very much"" and making sure it is in fact you that remains at the top of the tree by virtue of being here seven years earlier, why can they not just admit it's all about the vanity? why these continuing charades? i guess we're never going to know.no, you don't. you're just agreeing with those who like to appear to weild the authority of age, you don't know why you're agreeing, as you just amply demonstrated. however, if you do happen to know a reason why i'm allowed to use my awesome powers of rl cash to advance to end game status by buying a character off the bazaar from a bitter old veteran instead of buying it from ccp, feel free to say so. you'd be the first."
6/3/2010,"no, no you really arent.thats because you're presuming that the idea in your head is correct, and as such you don't need to listen to the overwhelming majority who think you're completely wrong.two points here. 1) the character bazaar doesn't increase the number of high sp characters in the game, it just spreads them around. 2) pretty much all mmo's have serious issues with people selling off characters in breach of the eula. the character bazaar is actually quite an elegant way of accepting the inevitability of character selling, but placing it within a game based financial setting. if people want to spend real $ to buy plex to buy characters, that real money is going direct to ccp, not to some guy via ebay. so what have you actually just achieved? you havn't narrowed the gap between old players and new players, you've just made a massive amount of the games content available to players much earlier, meaning people dont need to work towards anything or learn anything, they just get all the shiny toys really quickly. because from a game design pov, players expect to be rewarded for the time and energy they invest in a game. if you take that away, then you take away a lot of the draw of the game. eve is pretty rare in that players can't just grind and catch up in a month. if you hate it so much, gb2wow. actually as a professional game designer, i know very well why i agree with them and disagree with you. i have to deal daily with people who think their ideas are 'omfg awesomez!!' and which actually suck. i've laid out several of the reasons above, and many others have done the same. take a minute and actually think about them, and then think about the long term consequences for eve. it isn't pretty."
6/3/2010,"evaluation shouldn't be done by the concerned subject, but by independent observers.dude, get it in your head:sp/character supply is finite. plex/isk supply is finite. sp/character-price is directly co-related to the plex-price. thus there are limits.microtransaction sp-boost is by default infinte and inflates the amount of sp in ""circulation"", hence devaluating the plexes and isks by a great amount.ccp can not be interested in that happening, especially not, since it already happened once and to this day, they still call it a failure: learning skills."
6/3/2010,"min/maxing isn't what skills are for. they are just arbitrary barriers and/or goals for their respective activities. there is no trophy for efficiency. your involvement comes from doing things. you don't need zillions of sp to do thingswhy do you think you have to catch up? in any given ship, or performing any given activity, you are only using a relatively small set of sp. any other sp you have not related to the ship/activity is irrelevant. older players are more versatile, and why shouldn't they be?this isn't a korean game or wow. you are not intended to max out in a short time. once again, you don't need to. there are a massive amount of activities and ships you can use with low sp, and you can reach them quickly if you discipline yourself and not go 10 directions at once. you're caught in the 'catch up' trap again. this isn't wow where levels are a direct expression of a characters ability you already get boosted training and a free remap as a new player. you are supposed to use this time to learn some of the game mechanics, make some friends to learn from, set a few goals, and head that way. failing to do so is your faultthis was the time you were supposed to spend learning and making plans. if you spent it doing only the base things you learned in the tutorial instead, this is your problemexactly, you already have boosted training and a free remap. nobody had this option before apocrypha once again, sp and skill difference are irrelevant. in any given activity, a relatively small subset of skills/sp are being used. the 512k sp i have in caldari frigate are completely identical to every other players 512k. the 512k i might have in gallente frigate has no effect on my, or your ability to fly a caldari frigate. stop measuring your abilities and progress by other playershardcore players already understand that what you do, and knowledge of game mechanics that make the difference. it has little to do, if at all, with spthis was precisely the complaint that led to the skill queuethe snobs will still be snobs. it took them years to go over 100m. using plexes to catch up will cost you far more than using plexes to buy a character."
6/3/2010,"well using my can flipping as argument validation is just rubbish argumentation anyway, so i won't indulge your utterly bizarre inability to recognise world class can flipping. if you want to continue it some place, make your own thread. i'm not going to continue allowing this to serve in your own mind as arguement validation. even the ancient greeks had a name for that kind of flawed argument. can you guess what it is?no. i am asking for answer, i'm happy to accept a qualified, understandable, irrefutable answer, that's why i'm still here. i've been fed rubbish, i've reacted to being fed rubbish and the rubbish feeders have long since run off having been successfully called out on their rubbish. 1. no it doesn't. the market for sp is finite. there is no infinite $$$$ lying around waiting for ccp to open the door. where are you presuming these $ are going to be conjured from? they might shift from $>plex quite a bit, but you cannot just conjour a $ market from thin air. stop talking silly.2. just read number 2. particularly the closing line. then facepalm yourself for accidentally stumbling onto something. clue: ebay.(ask somebody who has sold characters on ebay just how much sp is worth. go on. ask.) uh huh. and? what of it? here we go with the ""hater!"" 'argument'. is there a limit to the number of weak argument tools you're prepared to pull out of your sport billy bag?you've implied i suggested removal of all investment and reward. look, if you're going to argue a point, argue the point that was offered, not the one you imagined in your head. ok? try again. this don't cherry pick a circumstance in your head a debate it with yourself and have me play the role of the person who gave you the topic to debate. do it properly or not at all.as an extremely professional and demonstrably successful game designer, i know very well why i want to hear an answer as to why somebody thinks a game should or should not have something in it. i have to deal daily with other very much less professional games designers who just simply agree with whatever the perceived alpha male is saying and thus get implied authority based on solely that. by now, if you worked where i worked, your boss would be agreeing with me and so would you."
6/3/2010,"as i said, we've reached the point where we simply have to agree that we have different views on the subject at hand and leave it to ccp to make the call they feel suits the betterment of the game itself."
6/3/2010,"did you vote in the csm elections?also, you could have used any of the following as valid reasons to not do it:2xplex does not equal 2xcharacter sp due to the training of attribute boosting skills. it's not a big discrepancy, but at low sp it is a huge percentage error.allowing people to use isk illegaly generated in game converted into illegally gained skill points becomes problematic when transfered to 3rd parties and can be used to launder isk.jealousy that somebody might have something i wasn't allowed.there are many others. feel free to use those three next time you need to say something sensible instead of ""merrrr... merrrr merrrr.... nooooooooooooooo........ what he said....."""
6/3/2010,have a nice day.
6/3/2010,"quoting these people cause it looks very fun doing so.dude, get in your head:if you are paying for sp with plex, then sp/character price is still directly co-related to the plex price at the same rate it does today. every plex spent to doubling someone's training speed is a plex not spent on extending someone else's play time or in an another word, stop training for that month. thus sp/character remains constant.taking character bazaar into account:instead of buying a character that's plex-fed for 2 years and have a 2y character right now, i can double training and get one myself one year later. the net result is that overall sp growth is slower. isnt that what ccp want, exactly like how you tried to show?i suggest you to read this over.most human players engage in more then one activity. why do you think older players have the right to be more versatile? isnt that because they have paid more money to ccp then i did? sure, here is my money, let me be versatile as well.is it not ccp's intention that i can instantly have a dozen titans, a cult work shipping me, and the ability to buy regions if i'm a russian billionaire?does not mean i cannot. you opinion is irrelevant to my right.lv1 warrior vs lv70 warlock. impairor vs avatar. you were saying? thanks for the advices, stupid mcstupidson.do not selectively quote what i wrote and twist it out of context.it's not. get a clue. ccp wants you to log in (and maybe play) from time to time. to many, switching skill is the only reason to do so.when everyone have 100m sp, you dont call them snobs. wannabe is the word. more importantly, it now cost about as much money to buy a character from bazaar as it is to raise it from plex if not more, especially for older characters. do get your fact straight."
6/3/2010,"no, you've clearly come here sure of your own faulty logic, and determined not to listen to any argument that doesn't basically consist of everyone going 'you're so right!'. if you are indeed also a designer, then i fear for the sanity of the poor programmers and artists that work with you. :p"

6/3/2010,comparing large armor reps to x-large shield reps is like comparing medium armor reps to large shield reps. x-large is called x-large cause it is larger then large so ofcourse x-large beats large reps.i'm to lazy to run the numbers on the x-type large shield reps but did you ever consider that shields also have nothing like eanm's? yes we have invul fields but they use cap.ow and try fitting a large shield buffer tank and compare it to armor buffer tanks. armor wins there not fair balance it.did i mention the basic 0% em resist on shields as well? not fair fix itarmor and shield tanks are diffrent on more points then just having a red shield bar when armor repping.

6/3/2010,"problem: currently there are 2 major factions you have to be part of to hold space in eve. the sc or nc. if a corp or alliance wants to move into 0.0 the only way it can possibly do this is to blue nc or sc. this effect has a compound effect, the more people join the nc or sc the more the stagnate the problem becomes. you see now alliances like aaa and atlas with monstrous size of pets in aaa citzens and etc.. basically all new corps alliance just join there because it is the only route you can take without being crushed by them. like look at providence(cva), they made a play for space to spice up the game and got crushed leaving the only 2 major factions sc and nc. believe it or not aaa actually blobbed them with huge odds out of their space.it used to be hard to move into 0.0 for a corp from empire. now they just take the easy route and join up aaa citizens and its like empire version 2.0 with blues everywhere. and it compounds into mega blobs.solution/incentives to make 0.0 politics to be more fractured:1. remove jump bridges2. add much more space in between regions to make unique hubs again, not stations everywhere. then increase station prices to 500bil. or just do this:3. make player stations destructable, there are too many of these in the game. one or just remove stations and make them cost 500 bil to build. in 0.0 where everyone can dock it does not stagnate the game because you cant just be locked out by a superior blob out of the region.most of these solutions are pretty bad, but the game gets pretty boring with just 2 huge factions dominating everything. and all of the problems stem from pets, you got aaa with aaa citzens, atlas with a ****load of pets, it not as much anymore they are more allies i geuss. i don't see a problem with allies as they made it on their own, the problem is when new people to 0.0 only have the option of joining the nc or sc. and i don't know much about nc but it is probably the same, or do they only have allies? over pets.ankh please fix, i put my faith into you <3<3<3don't let me down."

6/3/2010,"split the space between guristas and angels and spread rogue drones through the whole eve cluster. should make the drone regions more attractive to everyone, and drone alloys mineral sources would be more evenly spread through the eve cluster"
6/3/2010,"this guy has a pretty decent idea.spread drone spawns out everywhere, so you never know what you might stumble across in the next belt. increase incidence of command level drones (esp the drop rate of modified drone bpcs). open the drone regions up to a couple of warring pirate factions (angels & sansha, for example) and open up factional warfare with the two factions."
6/3/2010,"currently if you reprocess things you get back... maybe a little bit of base minerals (trit, ect). you don't get any of the t2 materials or other components at all. i haven't a clue about t3.this should be corrected to show proper reprocessing: you get 80% of the build materials of all components used in the construction of the item you're reprocessing.so a fitted, rigged t2 ship would return minerals, t2 build components, and salvage components (tho these should return far less than 80%. maybe 50% rather than complete destruction) for every part that gets reprocessed.of course you'll get a warning popup that you cannot disable telling you that there are modules/drones/rigs/ammo present on the ship you're reprocessing and that they will also be reprocessed. (or more simply it automatically unfits the ship and dumps the items into your hangar).bear in mind that (supposedly) years ago they reduced the available materials during reprocessing of meta-0 items to be 80% of their total manufacturing materials (as they were being used to 'compress' minerals for transport). these returns should be applied to t2 and any other material returns, even with 100% reprocessing efficiency."

6/3/2010,first i never posted a virus. that page is old and it is a rick roll. look it up moron.second missions are working fine. adapt or leave.third you make more in sanctums and havens before the patch and you make more now.stop whining in all the forums. and stop getting your topics locked because you are a moron.
6/3/2010,"if you've been running nothing but missions for 6 years then you really need to seek professional help. i'm completely serious. it's a sign of addiction, not simply enjoying a form of entertainment.ignoring that issue, you can still grind missions. i've been grinding away at low sec lvl5's this week to pay for a plex and some shiny new pvp toys to play with. i've been soloing them off and on in low sec for about a year and was doing low sec lvl4's before that. it's no big deal, been at least 2 years since i lost a pve ship to a player."
6/3/2010,"the no l5s in highsec (or at least, much less frequently) is fine and tbh a fix. they were introduced as lowsec content, something to benefit people who actually dare to live in lowsec. you shouldn't be entitled to do them safely. not every single damn resource should be available in highsec.as for l4 agents sending you to lowsec, well, i'd be fine if that didn't happen so much, etc, provided lowsec agents don't send anyone to highsec in return."
6/3/2010,not one person has given their support to your thread.maybe its because you don't want to post with your main.maybe because you cannot run level 5 missions to begin with.who knows.people won't support someone with 0 experience on the subject they are advocating.lone provider pator tech school from 2009.05.15 15:21 to this day.crappy standings too.
6/3/2010,ok not the best argument that could be used for a case like this but i agree that there are issues with some of what ccp have done to mission runners. i dont agree with all of it.
6/3/2010,"so you lost somo of your mission running income? how about go to skillshop, buy few planetary interaction related skillbooks and train that. week-two weeks tops that it takes time. then you have a brandnew even easier free income to cover your losses. ofcourse it would have been nice, if you got that pi income on top of your former income, but that new income has to be taken away from somewhere. and npc loot was the only way to go! if it wouldn't have been taked away from somewhere, it would have made inflation, so that the all new income isk you got on top of your former mission income wouldn't mean anything. it would make your wallet bigger, but also put prices up equally.the lvl4 missions are still too good income riskfree. risk free. meaning no risk involved in that particular action. the lvl5 to lowsec is a good thing. maybe i finally can start to do them, beacause they used to send me to highsec, where i can not go. also the lvl5 lp income was greatly too big to be done riskfree, risk free, in highsec.this ****ing game is made to risk - reward. and it was (still is) ****ed up badly. you can easily run your missions in lowsec. all it needs from you is eyes. keep your d-scan hot, watch local and its riskless. yes, maybe you get camped now and then, but hey, the reward is to equal that fact. but oh, wait, you can't afk missionrun anymore, if sent to lowsec? thats the problem? ach, true, that is crap. one really deserves a totally riskfree, good (highs isk) and afk income. that is true. so lets all petition this fast. lets really do it, so that we can contigniue riskfree, risk free, afk high income.ugly eric"
6/3/2010,oh noes! you dont get to play the game for free and still make huge sums of isk that miners and pvpers have no way to match? you're definitely being hard done by. introducing an element of risk to the most overpowered profession in eve? about damn time.
6/3/2010,"actually, nevermind, i threw a cheaper ship together, and what the hey, just did 6 lvl5s in a row and no gank i'm rich!"
6/3/2010,so ccp achieved their goal and we can close the case.
6/3/2010,"no. ccp stated from the outset that l5's were not supposed to be a high-sec solo isk-fest. they were intended to be run in gangs in lowsec, and were also intended to revitalize lowsec(lol). on the off chance you are butthurt about empire agents sending you to lowsec, either do it, or move on to another agent. there's plenty of them. on the off-off-chance your other cheek is hurt because the loot nerf, no. drone compounds and mission loot destroyed the mining industry."
6/3/2010,"lol! thats not all i do but its the majority of my income. as a casual gamer i want to log on, blow some stuff up, and log off. seeing as though my eitu agent already sent me to low sec fairly often what do you think this change has done to my ability to casually run missions?(its sharply declined) what do you think i am going to do as a result?(move to further away from low sec)load balancing doesn't work when you herd people into a smaller space which is exactly what this change did. i have no problem with it but i ran missions in eitu to get away from the hubs. now there will just be new hubs with much higher populations and the load balancing will be counter productive in the end. as a casual player it's counter productive to move to low sec or null because bouncing back from losses takes a lot longer when you are only running a couple of missions two times a week. the reason why the nerf is so powerful is more than just sending us to low sec, that part can be avoided for the most part, its added flight time from mission to mission and additional lag due to forcing the mission runner population into a smaller functioning envelope. i bet a million isk ccp didn't think the idea through very well or they would have taken steps to reduce the odds of being sent to low sec knowing full well that people would just migrate further inward.i agree that 5's should not be in high sec and that people running missions in low sec should be rewarded better than me but getting the occasional mission in high sec from a low sec agent or low sec from a high sec agent was an occupational nuisance before and now its become a serious nerf for many reasons.people are not supporting this thread because there is a csm proposed thread dealing with this problem already. no need for duplicates."
6/3/2010,"first proposal ever, so apologies if it is a repeat as i've looked but can't find an exact copy.proposal:during alliance/corp warfare, if a ""neutral"" (eg an alt in another non-dec'd corp) assists during a fight, eg remote repping, then this person is treated as a collaborator and is automatically aggressable by the other side.example:yesterday one of my corp mates was in a 6v4 fight, had his target into structure. a non-red appeared and remote repped the target, my friend was popped and podded. ok, so that's war, but he couldn't engage the repper as he wasn't red and was in high-sec.there needs to be a solution to this so stop alts/neutrals assisting. if this were the real world (and am very aware this isn't lol), then the collaborator would be attacked without a second thought.*closes eyes and covers ears ready for the flames*"
6/3/2010,"to clarify - i would anticipate:1. player remote reps an outlaw being attacked by somebody - player gets an aggression timer making him fair game for 15 mins2. player (in a neutral corp) remote reps another player involved in corp/alliance warfare. this player has declared him/herself for one side, and therefore becomes a valid war target until either of a) the war dec ends (most severe option) b) a fixed time period, eg standard aggression timer or maybe until the next time the war dec is renewed (last being my preferred option).i would specifically not anticipate this working for:1. any standard situation where you get aggression outside of the above, eg you just decide to agress somebody, can flipping etc."
6/3/2010,not new at all.
6/3/2010,"he could have engaged the remote repair ship though(it just wouldn't have done him any good most likely). when you remote repair a neutral fighting a third party, you get a 15 minute aggression timer against the third party. if the third party is at war with the person you assisted, then you have aggression against his corp/alliance as well most of the time."
6/3/2010,"then i apologise for putting in a proposal that demonstrates my inexperience with the mechanices of eve.although the possibility of, say, assisting a war dec resulting in you being aggressable until the war dec is renewed might make the use of alts / fake neutrals a bit more balanced."
6/3/2010,please use english when posting on the forums.
6/3/2010,"problem:the session change timer is another exceedingly irritating feature in the game. you dock up, and wait 20 seconds, leave your ship, wait 20 seconds, clone jump, wait 20 seconds, switch into your ship and then for some reason you can undock without waiting.all these actions could go on the same timer. undocking overrides the current session change timer, and replaces it with a new one. solution:how about allowing all in-station actions to be instantaneous but they would all cause a 20s internal timer that prevents you from undocking instead? in effect, docking up and changing ships would take the same amount of time, but doing several actions after one another would just renew the timer."
6/3/2010,"so i love eve wallpapers, and i know you do to! sadly though google just has the same 30 or so. eve main site does have a wall section, however it is sadly small. think there could be a way that it could be player updated or even have ccp do some updating? i know with at8 right around the corner there will be chances for awesome shots. whats the community think?"

6/3/2010,ccp cares more about walking in stations and mining planets than about actually having a usable interface.
6/3/2010,"when lawyers are walking around in stations with court orders and a huge optomitrist and legal bill, maybe then they'll reconsider!when eve was first developed monitors were smaller, text was bigger and it was easier to see. as time has gone on, the client has stayed behind and ignored a very basic feature every other piece of software has allowed.i've left eve twice because of the headaches. i want to play, and everyone agrees it has to change, but it always gets pushed back. and now it's six f'ing years and we're still waiting. it's time to stop pushing it back.we deserve to be treated better than this. we deserve to be treated with some dignity and some respect. while walking in stations may get new subscribers, the ones who stick it out are the ones they should care about, andthey are the ones who have gone ignored on this issue for years. they are the ones going blind trying to read a font that you can't even tell the difference between several of the characters."
6/3/2010,"it has been a long, long time since i last saw frigates being used as combat assets, their usefulness has waned ever more with the continuing introduction of larger ships. while all but the most advanced frigates have been relegated to shuttle and scout duties.this brings up the question, why have frigates become this way? what problems lie within the very foundation of the ship class itself? and what can we do to fix it?its not just assault frigates, rocket-based frigates, or any other sub-class that have these issues, all frigates are affected. and though some may work around the base problems with the class with mwds and cloaks, the rest have to suffer from these issues and are left unattended and unused.so what are these issues you may ask?the first, most glaring problem is short range weapons and closing distance, frigates have extremely short range weapons, that while excellent for their size, force them to come into very close range of larger ships. once in range they can perform their roles correctly, but getting into that range is a gauntlet in and of itself.you would think that frigates would need to worry about enemy destroyers, or anti-frigate platforms would cause the most issue, but then you would be wrong. while closing the range gap frigates are left completely exposed to the high-caliber weapons of larger vessels.frigates due to their small size, and relatively high-speed, have the ability to avoid the fire of these guns, but only once they enter their own, short attack range. while some frigates can utilize microwarpdrives to close the range faster, leaving them exposed for far less time, and others can use cloaking devices to get them in close, most frigates do not have these abilities. the problem isn't one with the frigate design, however. and retrofitting most frigates to use these countermeasures usually leaves them unable to perform thier intended roles.even if frigates do manage to pass the barrage of high-caliber weapons fire, and get within attack range, they will learn that their problems have just begun. enemy ships have a vast array of weapons systems and devices, that can leave the frigate harmless at best, or leave the frigate a heap of scrap, with the pilot scurrying to safety in their escape capsule.energy neutralizers can easily and absolutely shut down a frigate, leaving the ship without power. this means that the frigate may not be able to tank, or have the use of thier weapons systems. leaving them useless without damage, or offensive systems, and vulnerable with thier small base hp and no tank.energy neutralizers are not the only close in countermeasure larger ships have to use against frigates. frigates can also encounter stasis webifiers, which will slow the ship to a crawl, giving large-caliber guns ample time to aim, fire and in most cases instapop the aggressing frigate.a smartbomb may also be employed to dispatch frigates, the smartbomb usually covers the close-in area a frigate needs to perform his role correctly. avoiding the smartbomb in many cases will force the frigate out farther from his potential target, again exposing him to the fire of the targets large-caliber guns.another common countermeasure against frigates is the use of light drones. these drones can usually outmaneuver frigates, and even avoid fire or tank a frigates weapons. frigates can try to counter these and shoot them down, but they will find that the drones can leave just as fast as they came, coming and going from the safety of the parent vessel. and even if a frigate can manage to get ahold of one long enough to shoot and kill it, few can withstand the damage from the drones, and are forced to flee or die nonetheless."

6/3/2010,the problem with frigates is that when piloting one i am unable to change any of the font sizes of any of my ui elements.
6/3/2010,"this statement is completely wrong, so it's not worth to keep reading this. i don't know which game you're playing, but it's not eve. you don't know what you're talking about."
6/3/2010,"i'm not seeing any supporting evidence from you as to how he is wrong. perhaps you can offer some actual counter arguments instead of just saying ""you're doing it wrong!"""
6/3/2010,"i think you are looking at the wrong bits of the game.yes, if you come flying to a pos bashing cta in a frigate you will be told to gtfo and get a real ship.but in small gangs frigates are still alive and kicking. this varies between two opposites: the regular rifter-with-scram-and-mwd who are charging in, holding tackle for a second and then exploding in a ball of fire. this is fine as they are quite cheap enough for nobody minding the fact that they die fast. on the other end you have ships like ishkur and wolf. they do insane dps (for a small-gun based vessel at least) and have enough staying power to hold out agains that ""barrage of high calliber fire""so i think its not that something is wrong with frigates, i just thing you really need to atch how you use them. if they are used correctly they are great, if they are not you die in a very expensive ball of flames."
6/3/2010,"frigates have more than enough uses. and then i don't mean the t2 varieties.i will list a few, just to give a rough idea.# pvp trainingship. be it in corp or just head out to low sec.# expendable scoutship in wh's# expendable scoutship in low / null sec# in a descent group they can form quit a challenging pack for any cruiser or even a bs.why do i put expendable in 2 instances? simple. you don't have to have mad skills to be able to assist. just be ready to do your role, even if it means dying."
6/3/2010,"imo the only thing wrong with frigates is that it is time to remove the tiers and boost all frigates to the level of the tier 3 versions (rifter etc).addressing your specific issues, if you charge directly at a battleship then yes, you will have no traversal and die horribly to their guns. this is why good frigate pilots use their speed advantage to spiral into range.yes heavy neuts can cap out a frigate in one cycle, but their cycle time is 24 seconds whilst a small nos has a 3 second cycle time, a good tackler will be watching for neuts and will time their warp scram, ab etc carefully.smartbombs will kill frigates very quickly which is why (in a fleet) you ship scan the targets before getting closer than ~6km.drones hurt, which is why rather than shoot the battleship you first pop their light drones.a well fitted rifter (for example) can kill t2 frigs and cruisers fairly reliably or tackle battleships for long enough for something heavier to take over the tackle (and still get out alive in most cases). the fun thing is that whilst frigates are the least skill intensive to get into initially it is also one of the classes that really rewards good piloting."
6/3/2010,"frigates allow several advantages over other ship classes, not least of which is the ability to roam hostile null sec solo or in small gangs. they are fast, not just km/s fast but they allow quick travel for skirmish warfare. they are invaluable for tackling, while a lachesis can be used very well in organised insta-locking camps, they aren't nearly as expendable and lack the sig tanking for locking down larger classes.a key advantage is they are often underestimated and can be used to lull a target into a false sense of security. this can be seen in your post where your experience suggests they are useless.i'm hardly good at pvp but have been soloing in frigs for some time now and have had plenty of successes in frigates. you can look at tactics of many players in some of the best pvp corps out there and you will see plenty of frigates used. a lot of the more dedicated and successful pvpers out there also solo in frigates. it's not just a cost consideration, they can be truly rewarding to fly. one mistake made early and you are unlikely to recover. you could argue this to be a disadvantage but for people that actually enjoy a challenge, it's rewarding.i do agree with teadaze that they could look at updating the tier system as really there are some ships crying out for a redesign."
6/3/2010,"nothing is wrong with frigates, except afs are a bit suck.t1 frigates are fine at what they do, stealth bombers absolutely rock and are awesome, eafs are so/so (well, hyena/keres are bad), interceptors are fine and perform as advertised (mwd/tackle), covert ops are awesome/the swiss knife of eve. the vast majority of frigates work just fine.what you are referring specifically to is ""my closerange af with ab is cannon fodder and cannot close range"", which is interesting because you don't fit it with the module designed for enabling you to close range (mwd) and you're having unrealistic expectations from it (it being a solopwnmobile), and handily ignoring the fact all shortrange ships are at a disadvantage vs longrange ships if fight starts sufficiently far away.after qr changes and sb changes, frigate hulls are really quite good. afs are lacking; they're ridden with inter-class issues and with a lack of overall role. they need ship specific fixing and/or rethinking their role.also, the tier system and bad design of many frigates makes the rifter the only one which is good, and that bit does need a fix (as it does when it comes to cruisers where the tier system shows it ugly head again).a cursory roam with spamming d-scan reveals that there's no lack of frigates being flown?"
6/3/2010,is there any way for us to see the insurance prices on a ship that we don't own (i.e. i can't fly a drake but would like to learn the insurance costs/payouts of that)?

6/4/2010,supported -excellent idea!
6/4/2010,"suicide ganking is fine, stop crying and stop putting 500m of stuff in untanked badgers and doing other idiocy of the sort.the insurance changes mean t1 ships are no longer free. this fixes most of the issues with it.you can suicide gank them.the target can be remote repped as well. some people did this (tanked ganglinked bait hauler + rr logistics) to farm kb stats and harvest suicider tears.in fact bc has readjusted their ranking so people don't get crazy points for killing suicide gank bs with bait haulers+logistics+concord assistance, because people actually did do that (of course, people with a clue, not carebears with victim mentality, those are never capable of dealing with any problem) to farm battleclinic points (and for the lulz).finally, you can just pay mercenaries. that bit works as well."
6/4/2010,"my point is that i am not a pirate and shouldn't have to take a sec hit and be subject to death for taking out an outlaw. the current system is silly, i'm an outlaw with an outrageous bounty but you can't touch me without dying. running around with a repper setup to fix afkers is not a reasonable solution. i want to troll highsec with a pvp fit and hunt pirates. pirates say they want to pvp but can't so they do this because they're bored. so, i'm willing to give them something to fight. but them running around untouchable while they find easy prey is lame. if they're an outlaw, they should be treated as such. it seems like it should give them the excitement they say they desperately crave. and i don't have to worry about being labelled an outlaw for helping to provide that excitement.i don't run around afk (most of the time) so i'm not really worried about pirates myself. i certainly wouldn't spend isk on getting their suicide ganker alt killed.hey, there's blackbeard in the harbor! i got a rack of cannons with a bead on him.he hasn't attacked anybody in the last 5 minutes so you can't touch him."
6/4/2010,"1. it's called kill rights so actually, u can touch them; the problem is, u just refuse to utilize it.2. what? u're not willing to ""die"" in a game to get that much isk? it's u that's the problem because u don't want to take that risk and u want to punish risk-taking. it's the exact same situation as a hauler with expensive cargo, except the target is now the pirate with the high bounty. the only difference is, u're killing for ""e-justice"" instead of pirating so i'm sure the intention would be to your liking. nevertheless, u know what remains the same? the suicide gankers would take that risk to take out that pirate. and u still won't. again, it's called kill rights; use it and stop *****ing.seriously, u can touch him. if they can suicide gank u, *gasp* guess what? u can suicide gank them! u just don't want to 'cause u don't want to take risks and all u want to do is punish ppl for taking risks. u don't want to take risks, fine. let everyone else play their game while u sit in your station, not knowing how to defend yourself and others 'cause u're too stupid and scared to. or better yet, go back to wow."
6/4/2010,"i support this idea. im not for security status changes, but if ship is targeted by concord insurance will not be payed and isk spent to insure ship would be lost. also, there should be option that player before loosing ship can destroy every module and cargo...not like self destruct...something that will be instant."
6/4/2010,"1) i am talking about proactively taking them out before they can start their suicide gank. you don't get kill rights unless you get killed by them first. by the time they target you, they already believe they will win and i would expect that they'd be right as they, of course, target pve players.2) i'm willing to die if the pirate bests me. i think it's ridiculous that condord would kill an anti-pirate. they should get a sec-boost as well. and it's not a risk. the risk is taking on a pve'r and losing. calling certain death at the hands of concord isn't risk. maybe you should look up the definition. it's not the same situation as a pvp pirate vs pve freighter. it would pvp pirate hunter vs pvp pirate. and the suicide ganker probably uses next to worthless gear and no cargo.again, i'm not talking about stalking a guy because he killed me, hoping to catch him before my time runs out. it has nothing to do with me being attacked at all. i just want the opportunity to take out an outlaw in hi-sec before he has the chance of carrying out his suicide or be able to jump in when he has someone under attack. i don't know what you're talking about here but again you obviously don't know the definition of risk. and i am not advocating a position of staying in station when i'm talking about the ability to anti-pirate. my suggestion makes it so that pirates don't face automatic death at the hands of concord but empowers players to help take up that role.being an anti-pirate =/= becoming a pirate which is what someone has to do with the present system.pirates can try and suicide on me all day for all i care. seems like your the one with the sensitivity issues."

6/4/2010,"i support the call for more excellence to go about it imho is that 2 halfs doesnt make a whole,let me explain: the last few new expansions were lacking the promised content it was supposed to haveand if you promise something you should deliver imo.if its not possible to make half yearly expansions with the expected features then make a huge and very satisfying large one yearly(2 halfs doesnt make a whole)my suggestion is to make this a yearly one for new game mechanics/content (like sov changes/pi) that has been properly run though it passes and add corification for future ccp products.too increase the excellence in the game you can ad new patches on a random basis and that doesnt have to be tide in too the schedule of a new expansion (read difference between patches and an expansion)in these patches you can but some extra fluff like the scorpion model that got new looks or the luv the faction ships got, or the loot changes for missioners and other miscellaneous etc etc.to me these sound like diferent itterations of the already available game content/mechanics and should be more easily done compared to new game features (no disrespect too all the hard work)so releasing stress buildup and giving space for excellence is the main priority here.lets be honest what draws us too eve everyday is already there, we only need too make it shinier and on occasion fill it up with different stuff."

6/4/2010,"supported.it's more than apparent that ccp is moving too fast with their goal of putting out an expansion twice a year. i'd be happy with an expansion once every 9 months to a year. i believe it's time for ccp to put a hold on their upcoming projects, sift through the broken items and fix them. they need to listen to their player base instead of being the arrogant bullies they are portraying themselves as. their lack of response to the feedback threads is inexcusable. especially after a major release. further, the csm needs to hold ccps feet to the fire on this one. the way csm4 rolled over was a joke. mynxee has indicated in her blog that she intends to keep this issue in the forefront of the next csm meeting with ccp. i'm hoping she has the leverage to accomplish this.ahs"

6/4/2010,"i think the best change would be the extra low/mid slot, but in general i support the other changes as well."
6/4/2010,i agree...i hated doing all that learning stuff.i really think it was a terrible few weeks.i also hated waiting to get into a battleship with t2 weapons and mods.can we have all those skills to for our noobs ?i would also like my day old character to be able to fly a carrier with max skills.its done to give you discipline. you know that thing most lack their first couple weeks.so if you can't hack the first couple weeks this game is not for you anyway.
6/4/2010,"supported. here's why:learning skills in eve don't actually do anything. they represent an arbitrary time buffer which, if i had to guess, was originally designed to keep the complete newbies from competing with the advanced players. nobody enjoys training learning skills. we only do it because if we don't, we suffer in the long run. is there anybody here, anybody at all, who enjoyed training up learning skills? of course not. nobody enjoys sitting around not advancing (or advancing slowly) for a period of x weeks/months.given that it obviously isn't fun, we have to ask ourselves, is it necessary? what useful purpose do learning skills serve?comparing them to other skills is bad, because they don't actually affect gameplay at all. comparing them to implants is bad, because there's no risk-reward concerns involved.if the purpose of the learning skills is to keep newbies from getting too good too fast, well, given that you need a matter of years before you can max every available skill, somehow i don't think this is that great a concern anymore, if it ever was.if the purpose of learning skills is to enforce a sense of patience, i think waiting a couple of weeks for a level 5 skill should enforce that just fine.if the purpose of learning skills is to create the impression of character customization, this is a moot point: most everybody gets learning skills, it's just a matter of when. those who don't get them usually end up leaving the game as the longer waits for more advanced skills become unbearable.remove learning skills, +50 statpoints and a free neural remap across the board, redistribute learning skillpoints in the form of a temporary 10/100x training speed multiplier. vets get a training boost, rookies don't have to suffer, everybody gets greater control over their character.everybody wins."
6/4/2010,"ask the people who quit because of the learning skills how much they liked being 'efficient'.a game is not a job. the objective is to have fun. for some this obviously means being as efficient as possible. for many, it doesn't.also, saying this over and over won't make it true.in other news:your persecution complex is stunning, and only matched by your lack of comprehension of the purpose of the learning skills."
6/4/2010,"woah woah, where did that come from?one, i've been playing eve on and off since 2005, so i'm not sure how i'd have a persecution complex in regards to being a newbie.two, i am honestly unsure as to why learning skills exist. a barrier to entry is all i could really think of, but i included customization because it also seemed like a possibility, and a slightly cynical passing mention to patience because somebody else mentioned it earlier in the thread.besides those three reasons, why else should learning skills even exist? if you can take the time to attack my character, you can take the time to attack my points.i want to hear your opinions."
6/4/2010,"it certainly seemed that way, given that you'd guess that the reason for a character development change would be to disadvantage new players, when the opposite has always been the case. really does sound like a narrow-minded [insert playstyle] complaining about how [ccp/eve/players/god] hates them.to make things train faster. that's what they do. they don't provide a barrier, they makes things faster.i mention some of it here and there is more scattered throughout the thread."
6/4/2010,"i'm just going to go straight to attack the false premise that these skills add some kind of variety to the game.let's say you have two players, player a and player b. you give them both an identical skill plan: a list of skills to learn, and an order in which to learn them. now, to make this interesting, you tell player a to max out his learning skills before following along the skill plan.to start off with, player a is way behind player b in skills (besides learning). but as they both follow the skill plan, something happens: eventually, player a catches up to player b. this moment in time, we shall refer to as ""the threshold"". after crossing the threshold, assuming that player a and b both spend an equal amount of time training skills (and provided that implants are identical for both players, etc etc), player b will never have as many skill points as player a.the only real ""choice"" in regards to learning skills is this:will you get your learning skills first, or do you plan to be playing for less time than it takes to reach the threshold?to reiterate this more simply: ignoring your learning skills is only a good idea if you plan to stop playing the game at some point. the fewer learning skills you get, the shorter your character's lifespan must be for you to not be punished for it.any game feature which discourages players from playing is a bad thing. the loss of the paltry ""choice"" that is presented to rookie players is a small price to pay, because when given a choice of ""suffer now or suffer later"", most new players will leave."
6/4/2010,"let's say you have two high-school graduates, player a and player b. you give them both identical grades and resources, but you send b out into the job market and a to college. : b is going straight to making money and a is maxing out his learning skills before following along the plan.to start off with, player a is way behind player b in money. but as they both follow the plan, something (probably) happens: eventually, player a catches up to player b. this moment in time, we shall refer to as ""the threshold"". after crossing the threshold, assuming that player a and b both spend an equal amount of time working and training skills (and provided that implants are identical for both players, etc etc), player b will never have as much money or skill points as player a.you can make the same analogy with two graduates given money  one puts it into savings/investments and one spends it on stuff. is it a choice? yep. is it more efficient to go to college / save money / train learning first. yes. do people always choose the most efficient path? absolutely not. people choose when and where to trade efficiency for convenience / enjoyment / etc all the time. this happens in life and is mirrored in eve. removing choice is bad. removing depth is bad. if the learning skills are ever removed, i hope nothing replaces them and no bonuses are given. slow everyone down to the same slow rate no stat increases, no skill replacements. nothing."
6/4/2010,"yes, but when the second graduate runs out of money, he doesn't usually kill himself.you can not reliably compare advancement in real life to advancement in mmos. believe me, i've tried; by god have i tried. the fact of the matter is that people are far more willing to leave mmos than they're willing to leave real life.when made to choose between the lesser of two evils, an mmo player will leave.removing depth can be bad. but it is not unconditionally bad.learning skills are not worth the damage the cause."
6/4/2010,"i suppose that's true if your cause is to increase the number of players at a faster rate than eve has been growing. bearing in mind that eve is one of the most stable success stories in the mmo world and still grows, i'm not sure that should be our concern. my ""cause"" would be keeping it true to the complicated, pain-in-the-ass, game that got us all hooked in the first place. learning skills are part of that picture - and removing them damages the cause."
6/4/2010,"eve's appeal is its complexity and its freedom, not being a pain in the ass. there is nothing complex about learning skills (i could summarize them in a paragraph), and they do more to limit freedom than promote it (because if you don't get them before anything else then you screw yourself over). they actively deter newer players.by your logic, how about we add tier 3 learning skills with 5x training multipliers? where does it end, and more importantly, why does it end there?"
6/4/2010,"as so often happens, your entire argument boils down to the imaginary skills race. yes, player b will never have as many skill points as a. fortunately, this doesn't matter in any way shape or form. and in return, player b will have acquired 'real' skills sooner than a, which is presumably what b wants since he chose not to do all the learning skills early on. and therein lies the choice which so many wish to deny but which continues to exist nonetheless: does b wish to be as effective as possible in the long term, as a does, or does he instead want to focus on the short term for now?the idea that you get 'punished' for not training the learning skills is also nonsense and is based on another common fallacy; that the training speed you have once you have all the learning skills is the 'baseline', and the learning skills are a mandatory timesink to get there. in fact, your training speed without any learning skills (or implants) is the baseline, and the learning skills merely optionally trade time for a rate increase. there is no punishment, merely a trade of a short-term advantage for a long-term one.somewhere in the middle there you came dangerously close to implying that the game is no longer worth playing if you fall behind in the skills race: ""will you get your learning skills first, or do you plan to be playing for less time than it takes to reach the threshold?"" etc. i will assume that you did not mean to imply this, since such an implication would be ridiculous on a scale never before witnessed on these fora. without this implication, you are merely asserting that a player's highest priority must be their position in a non-existent race which, while still nonsense, is a few astronomical units closer to the realms of rational thought.the only damage they cause are the removal of people too foolish to understand what you yourself say is not a particularly complicated part of the game. they were lost before they ever started.people's narrow views of how eve should be played limit their freedom, the game does not.there have been requests for them."
6/4/2010,"find me one character who has 3 months of active playtime and who has no learning skill above level 3.one.one single character, and i will retract everything i have said, and concede to your point. i will not ask for more players. i will not move onto another point. i will retract all i have said and concede that they are a viable optional skill choice if you find me one single player out of the 200-odd thousand that meets that criteria.stay your tongue. the fact is, after a certain point, there is literally no advantage to having neglected learning skills. because by the time you reach that point, if you'd invested in learning skills, you'd have those other skills anyway.creating a game that nobody will touch is not a goal to aspire to. it's not about understanding, it's about choosing if you want to leave an account to boil for weeks before playing the game or suffering for it if you end up playing longer than you envisioned.this isn't about perspectives, it's about math.well then by all means let's add in tier 4, 5, 6 and 7 learning skills too!"
6/4/2010,"a fallacious request, because even if no-one has done it that does not mean it isn't viable; certainly not with armies of trolls trying to get people to train learning skills until they quit. a foolish request, because i am hardly going to spend the time to find such a person just for you. and finally, a loaded request, since you chose a level of the skills which takes virtually no time to train, and which will thus be part of even the shortest term skill plan.you're going to need a better substitute for an actual argument than that.yes. i do believe i mentioned that one was short term and one was long term. and?and yet ccp aspire to it, and the subscription numbers just keep on rising.i've already told you what is wrong with this. repeating it won't make it true.no, it's about perspective. math helps you win the race. perspective lets you realise the race doesn't exist."
6/4/2010,"give it up, crumplecorn. these guys come from games where you ""win"" by maxing out your character sheet, and they're not capable of/interested in understanding any other way to 'play'. they're not wrong in their terms of reference. that's why you're never going to win them over."
6/4/2010,"new players have three options:- train everything frustratingly slow until they quit - ""i've been playing this game for 6 months and i can barely fly a cruiser!""- train everything frustratingly slow for a month or two while they get some skills for their profession. then burn a month on learning skills and continue playing the game.- burn a month on learning skills and then start playing the game. these people overwhelmingly quit the game because it's incredibly boring.you may claim that the last option is stupid, but i would counter that all of the options are stupid and that there can be no good options for a new player as long as learning skills are in the game. i would rather people log in and start training useful skills instead of meta skills. this lets them get into a reasonably skilled rifter faster, or a thorax, or rupture, or battleship. this either gives me someone to fly with or someone to shoot - either one's fine with me.i further find it incredibly ****ing funny that you decry these people as min/maxers when that is exactly the only type of person that can possibly be successful at playing eve. eve is a game of progressive specialization until you have a pretty extreme amount of sp - and people that take the ""generalist"" path tend to just suck at everything. -liang"
6/4/2010,not as long as i have time to kill though you're right that minmaxers will likely never see past minmaxing.you conveniently left out the most sensible option for non minmaxers. protip: the learning skills do not have to be trained all at once.eve is a game of doing whatever you want until you run out of things you want.
6/4/2010,"this is your own way of min/maxing, but ultimately doesn't change the options that the player has - because you're still effectively burning a month of time on learning skills (whether it's all at once or not is kinda immaterial).one could argue this, but that end comes much sooner when you do stupid things and generally fail at the game. even still, learning skills should not stand in the way of doing what you want to do as they currently do.-liang"
6/4/2010,maybe we should have learning skills that help you learn learning skills faster. that would give everyone more options and choices of how to create their character.
6/4/2010,"only if you look at it from a 'will i have as many sps as the joneses in 2 years' end game minmaxing point of view.saying it, not making it true, etc etc."
6/4/2010,ill sign this if i get to have my 1.8 million sp back. ill even put it into fighters so its not worth anything again and will let me train that hateful fighter bomber book making me not have all the skills in the set.
6/4/2010,"no, not only if i look at it that way. more of a ""this price has to be paid so that i don't frustrate the **** out of myself with 75 day battleship 5s"" point of view.yes... exactly. you saying that it doesn't matter if it takes 25 days of 50 days to train a skill doesn't make it true. it does matter. as i said - i would rather have ""noobs"" start the game and train real skills that help them do something in the game instead of meta skills.-liang"
6/4/2010,"no, i claim that there's a 4th option, which i have pointed out repeatedly in this an other threads, and you have repeatedly ignored, for whatever reason.- intermingle learning skills and other skills; 50% of the initial 1.6m bonused sp will suffice to get a player to 4+4 (4+2 on cha), at which point he'll be learning at ~90% of the rate of the most maxed out player in the game. you can get to this point within the first month with a well-done skillplan.if you're going to say that doing this is overly onerous, we'll just have to agree to disagree. as it is, i'm borderline on thinking you're trolling me for ignoring this option every time you reply to my posts. your refusal to acknowledge anything except extreme options (all learnings to v before undocking) in either direction (not one rank in learning skills before hac v!) makes discussion with you pointless."
6/4/2010,i didn't ignore that option at all. you're acting like this somehow means that they didn't burn this time training meta skills instead of real skills. this entire thread can be summed up with choosing between two situations:1. people log in and they spend time training other skills so that they can train skills. this significantly delays their ability to train real skills.2. people log in and train real skills.you're choosing #1 for brain dead reasons - straight up. there's no excuse for this game having learning skills.-liang

6/4/2010,"thank you for your astornoshingly insightful input. your posts were ignored. let me clarify: clone jumping is now a good way to destroy your next day of gameplay. it is voluntary, sure, but sometimes you want to play the game but are forced to spin your ship in a station or go play world of warcraft instead, because you cannot forfeit the next day by clonejumping. as far as i can see it there are no real reasons why the timer should be so long. your illuminating points on space travel are as stupid as they are irrelevant. i'm glad you didn't write a howto on how stargates work. either say something constructive or go troll on caod."
6/4/2010,"not everyone, who doesnt agree with you, is trolling you.distance has to mean something in eve. either you plan your clone jumps accordingly or you will have to find other means of getting from a to b. for the same reason i would nerf jump bridges to be honest."

(hint: it will be you)"
6/4/2010,i agree 100% and would like to add if i may.that people who purposely put their ships at risk should also get 0 insurance.if you purposely fly into a pirate or drone infested mission. 0gank a high sec mission runner. 0undock. 0do anything that could cause your ship to explode purposely or accidentally and get paid nothing.
6/4/2010,"this is not about stoping high sec ganking. it's more about making it harder. i built an alt, leveled it enought to fly a battleship, outfit it with smart bombs and bombed the hell out of people myself. took me just under a month, and with a little capital the platinum plan payouts kept my alt in bs's and bombing people for weeks. i just thought that taking away that insurance for anyone willing to break the law seemed to make sense, as well as would slow them down a little.as for the insurance not being a rl buisness model, i disagree. i've bought insurance with my main maybe 50 times, and collected insurance on a lost ship but 1 time. the insurance company made more money off me then i made off them so i think it is some what realistic.admittedly some people insure thier ships, run out into low sec and get themselves blow up for the fun of it, but then maybe they should also add high risk polices increases and such like rl insurance would have. i didn't know about the insurance changes before i created this post, just thought it was a good idea and i wanted to share.for those who say i want a wow like enviroment, well i never said this would stop them, nor did i mean for you to think i want a 100% safe high-sec, i just thougth it'd add a little more realism to the insurance then what is there now"
6/4/2010,for some realism. if you purposely crash or whatever you will be black balled and lose your license eventually.so there you go.
6/4/2010,i agree. the deliberate destruction of your property through illegal activity is insurance fraud as far as i am concerned.
6/4/2010,"if someone builds a space vessel and fits weaponry to it, i think they get arrested. oh wait, this is why real life comparisons don't work isn't it. not supported.edit for rage:can you morons stop using real life comparisons? eve is nothing like real life, so making a real life comparison makes you look like an absolute ******. in real life if there were pirates in your backyard the space police would go and take care of it, not tell you to go do it. eve isn't a safe place. get over it."
6/4/2010,"highsec ganking is already punished with a decrease of security status.i think the highsec is already the ultimate carebear-playground.there is no need to add further restrictions for beeing rude.(ps.: im in highsec, too)actually gate-gamps only exists because of the following thought:""oh, lets take this items with a worth of 1b, put em into my badger mark i and fly em to jita. 20 jumps? well auto-pilot!!nothing can happen - its highsec.""if players would be more careful about that, they might split up the cargo, take bigger ships - or use courier contracts to those that have the bigger ships.why carry 5b faction stuff with a ""badger""? better use a 200k-fitted battleship - and no body would alpha-strike you."
6/4/2010,"why not just say ""remove insurance altogether?"""
6/4/2010,i'd just like to point out again that insurance bears no relation to anything in rl. it seems to need repeating a lot.carry on.
6/4/2010,supported. if you want to suicide gank then go for it. no problem with it. it shouldn't be free or nearly free to do so on the other hand. at the very least it makes the gankers cherry pick higher quality targets.
6/4/2010,"why do people keep saying this? does it really matter if you are auto-piloting and afk? a suicide gank happens faster than concord response. it doesn't matter if you are afk on autopilot or glued to your screen with you hand on the warp button, if the pirates want you dead, you are dead.i just wish people would stop pretending that somehow autopiloting is less safe. sure in the incoming trip to the gate you warp to zero and are gone before they can respond. but on the other side of the gate you still have to align and warp off, and against a dedicated group with tacklers and what not, that's not going to happen unless you are specifically fitted to avoid it, and freighter can't fit.i will agree autopiloting is a tiny tiny bit safer if the pirates are slow, but most suicide attacks happen in seconds and you are dead whether you are paying attention or not.anyway, just my opinion."
6/4/2010,"i you believe high sec space should be completely safe you don't belong in eve , no one should be able to hide unless their at a pos or docked up in a station or cloaked.high sec ganking comes with a prize, the loss of your ship and a sec hit which it is how it should be."
6/4/2010,"i cannot support this idea. the only way i could see it working is if they would offer a 'premium' insurance option to cover for concord interference. but even so, it would cause problems for new players, or people that hit the wrong button on accident, etc."
6/4/2010,indeed. no iskies for those foolish enough to mess with concord!
6/4/2010,"i'm in agreement with this. suicide ganking, imho is a valid play style, preventing high sec from being 'absolutely safe'.the only problem i see with it, is that a suicide ganker does not 'lose' anything by doing this, due to the insurance.( buy a bs 60m, insure it, suicide it on someone, get 60m insurance payout + anything your friend grabs from the target )as such, it's a 'safe' investment to suicide gank, not mattering even what you gank, except maybe wasting your time on some small frycarrying 100k tritanium, isntead of a juicy freighter full of morphite ;)if the new insurance system makes it so targetting the small fry will make them lose money in addition to the usual penalties(which can be negated by simply making a bunch of suicide alts you throwaway after they become unusuable ), while still making a truckload of isk from intercepting that big juicy 2b freighter, then it's a properly balanced way of doing it. if not, then imho, the insurance should be voided if you get concorded."
6/4/2010,perhaps would make pirates think twice before ganking.
6/4/2010,show me one insurance company that will pay something when my car gets busted during a police chase.lax
6/4/2010,"i support this for one reason: it makes sense in universe.an insurance company exists to make money. if people are making money from them, the companies are losing it. so it would make sense that they would not pay for a suicide gank.otherwise, i don't care. i've been ganked on other chars... it happens. just get up and start over."
6/4/2010,"signed in-spite of recent changes because, well, it just makes sense o.o"
6/4/2010,"i don't get the belief that level 5's should be in low sec. why do people say this? i've been playing for over about a year and a half and got sooooooooooooo utterly out of my skull bored with level 4's once i could solo them ages. level 5's are tough and a great challenge in my opinion. if you don't bring a 1.5b isk bs you have to really think them through. but why oh why on earth would you ever possibly do it in low sec where you're so easily scanned down and attackable by pvp players? why? the risk reward is so heavily skewed to risk that it's silly unless your sitting on a mountain of isk and dont mind losing even a bottom barrel 200m isk battleship. our corp loved running these missions in high sec. it was a great way to bring younger players along for them to see what a mission is like you have to work your way through. the isk isn't that unbelievable considering you have to split it with multiple other players, making them an even balance isk wise to a fast run level 4 solo. allow these to drop in high sec! or else drastically increase the rewards because unless the risk reward gets into balance where you can expect youll lose 2-3 ships to complete the mission due to pvpers popping you in your pve fit while they have pvp fits and can gate camp with no skill just numbers so even getting to the mission opens the chance of you dying its completely not worth it. ccp has made this game so utterly boring for me now. i want casual play where i can come in, play for a couple hours and go, which is i think a large portion of the group. and if you hit 20m sp and don't want the politics of alliances what can you now possibly do in eve that's a balanced challenge and allow you make isk relative to your skill point level?"
6/4/2010,oh ****. thinking? in my eve... nevar!
6/4/2010,"no, reread the words i wrote. i took the time to write them, you take the time to read them, that's how this works. you say something that isn't easily shot down as pure fantasy, i take it on board. fairly simple. sadly all you have come here with is ""what he said earlier"" and what he said earlier was nonsense then, nonsense now, and they're not here either clarifying their position or offering a different one.now... just declare victory, shout hater, and move on to another thread where you might ""pwn"" somebody who actually hasn't a clue. there's a guy called goose99 currently trolling everwhere, try him, he's a fairly mediocre adversary i fancy your chances. here, there's nothing for you."
6/4/2010,"i've been reading your posts, all you want is instant gratification. you want all the toys to play with without any work. that cheapens whatever you strive for in the game. all you have done here is whine like a two year old wanting a candy bar. work for it or go back to wow full stop."
6/4/2010,happy trolling.
6/4/2010,"how about: this feature would be redundant, and detrimental to the in-game economy. paying for skill advancement is already accomplished through the character bazaar forum, except the character bazaar offers a much, much larger variety of price points and advancement levels. the character bazaar fulfills all the needs of the core idea behind this thread, with the sole exception of character name. you can even swap your old character's portrait onto your newly bought character if you want now. furethermore, though you can buy all the plex you want to get a character now, the consumption rate of plex is relatively constant (barring bumps around expansions), which increases competition for plex on the market. the proposed plan would effectively double plex consumption, increasing the cost of plex in the long run, while being more costly than the current system of paid advancement.that combined with the deflationary effects of ccp's changes in tyrannis would ensure that only the players paying real cash for plex would be able to use this system of advancement, screwing over the poorer players who were paying their subscription with isk. the current method introduces more plex into the market than what is consumed (or at the very least contributes to the trend), keeping the prices lower for players who can't afford to dump real cash down for the game, and also keeps the real $/isk value high, helping to counteract real life forces from introducing greater inflation into the game's economy."
6/4/2010,"gavjack bunk is quite solid at trolling. i give you a 6/10, keep it up!"
6/4/2010,not supported. it's taken me years to develop my characters. the last thing i really feel like seeing is a bunch of rookies coming in and buying their way into a high end character that i had to wait this long to get into. wait in line like everyone else.
6/4/2010,the post you quoted answered this exact question.
6/4/2010,"here's a good start. but it didn't last. paying for skill advancement is not accomplished through the bazaar. buying characters is. the character you buy will either not gain sp, or require another account to gain sp, thus requiring more plex. but go on, let's see what you get wrong next.ok, hold it. yes there is more variety. you tout this as a good thing. yet the variety that i get to choose how fast i gain sp for myself is bad, ok, i'm guessing your not going to tell me why. the bazaar does not fulfill all the needs of the core idea behind this thread with the ""lol"" sole exception of name. even the portrait can change! o rly?how long did it take you to forget about standings? how long did it take you to forget about my amassed assets? how long did it take you to forget about reputation?when i buy a character from the bazaar, is it going to come with baggage and crap. it's not going to have what i need where i need, the standings i want, and additionally, and this is a really really really important point that gets lost on people, it won't be my character it will another character. i don't even want another character. so what's the crack?i have to sell my character, dumping assets and sending funds to an alt, and then i have to find the $$ and then buy another character that has the sp i need, and then i have to pray i can find one that has the standings i want and without the reputation of the peckerhead who owned it previously?well that's a delightful process by the sounds of things. all i need to do is jump through a load of pointless ccp hoops, a load of bitter old veteran hoops and additionally come up with $400 on the nose to get the sp i want.and that would be fine with the bitter old veteran community.but the idea that i don't have to go through that crap process, and that i can find the $400 progressively and easily over six months, well that's just so abhorrent yet nobody seems to know why, or at least can't explain why?hang on. ""double"" it? where did you get that number from? yes i agree, people will start to buy plex with isk for a new purpose, and therefore starve the current purpose of some plex isk, thus yes increasing plex competition, possibly even pushing the price of plex up, and therefore encouraging people to buy them for $ and sell them, pushing the isk price down. if that is true, it is true for all uses of plex. there would be nobody buying them for isk at all. please avoid talking nonsense in future replies. tyrannis has not destroyed the free play time plex market. get over it. if plex prices rise, it would encourage more people to push the price down with increased supply.shall i say it would ""double"" it? pulling absolutes out of thin air is popular this time of year after all.."
6/4/2010,"no it didn't. it contained an unqualified assertion with no rationale, but a kiddiepron sig that attempts to appeal to the crowd for support.i checked the whole post too. nothing that you describe is in it.let's pretend for a moment, the bitter old veteran convenient assertion is true that their is a well of dollars just sitting there... quietly... waiting... for the moment ccp open the flood gates to infinite skill points!!!!! in all of eve....why are these multi billionaires sitting in their mansions not training 3 million accounts instead of waiting for ccp to open the door? i mean, had they just got the ball rolling 5 years, they'd be super pwn by now. and since ccp aren't likely to introduce this until after dust is released anyway*, starting today they could get a cool headstart on their 3 million new characters?that's right, because their is not a massive well of millionaires just waiting to flood new eden with skill points. it does not exist.i'm just sitting... waiting... for that one magical reason to appear, why it's just so wrong that i buy a character from ccp instead of a veteran.well i'm not actually. i already know several extremely self serving reasons why they don't want it. but they're not telling.selling characters on ebay is one pretty good reason, and personally knowing how much money can be made doing this, i know extremely well why they are keeping their mouths shut on that one.*i presume that ccp assume that virgin dust players might migrate to become eve players, and dust console community will not stick around waiting for sp. they didn't buy a console because they like watching numbers tick up very slowly."
6/4/2010,yes it did.because having two characters each with half the skills you want is not the same as having one character with all the skills you want?
6/4/2010,this sums it up nicely
6/4/2010,"you are incorrect.well the sooner they start the sooner they get the skills that the bitter old veteran community has decreed they should be allowed.my favourite one so far was hilariously, if this was true, if like i'm getting so frequently, there is a hidden community of millionaires, lurking, watching from the shadows, waiting... stalking... scheming.... plotting... just waiting for the day ccp openly sell sp, then like madner thinks infinite, and i quote, ""infinite"" dollars suddenly become available to ccp, then ccp would have it available by noon today.yeah right madner, like ccp don't even want infinity dollars.where do you strange people think this massive pool of cash is going to come from turning eve into a soup of infinity sp? so strange that you don't want to tell us. no wait not strange, the opposite of strange, perfectly understandable. you don't know. you are just sure you are correct."
6/4/2010,"you massively underestimate, how willing and *generous* people are at pumping money into an internet-game. you're a prime example of that."
6/4/2010,"any time you want to explain why the infinity dollar pool will burst it banks when ccp freely sell sp and not now when only veterans freely sell sp, go right ahead.until then, please entertain me more with tales of how infinity works. i'll get the ball rolling for you.0.9 recurring = 1.0?true or ""god you're so obviously dumb"""
6/4/2010,"a bad can flipper and forum troll worried about picking up a character with a bad reputation. priceless. you've already answering this yourself. many people don't want someone else's character, with someone else's reputation, and standings and etc etc etc. buying a character also tends to cost multi-billions. if its a choice between forking out 15b for a character, or the sly temptation to spend a few hundred million to make your own character cooler, which do you think is going to get the most take up?"
6/4/2010,"this is idiotic. even if everything the whiners above said was true, the only effect this would have is to act as an isk drain for every player in eve. there wouldn't be a single player who didn't use this, except for noobs who couldn't afford it. which would, of course, lead to more whining like omgnerfbuyingsp!!!!it would be learning skills on crack, and ccp has made it quite clear that they think introducing learning skills was a horrible idea.not supported. barbie says ""math is hard!"""
6/4/2010,"learning skills on crack?what? just because some people would be doubling their sp gain rate?on crack?what did you misread? or is this one of those typical reactionary states where you pretend that something was proposed that wasn't proposed? you know what i mean, where somebody said ""use two plex's for double gain rate"" and you decided to read ""use two thousand plexs for two thousand times the gain rate""?because if that's the case, you should speak out against that character bazaar thing. their are literally tens of thousands of millionaire bastards just starting eve, and buying literally tens of thousands of pre-owned sp for real money wouldn't you believe!? how very dare they?what has ccp saying they don't like learning skills got to do with sp gain rate?also, the presence of learning skills or whether ccp admit they goofed has actually nothing to do with sp gain rates, bringing that up as some sort of justification is pretty funny."
6/4/2010,"no, i have made no attempt to answer what happens when infinity dollars and infinity sp arrive. you're not reading the words typed. you're reading words you wish had been typed. it's the other people who are the ones trying to tell me what happens when mr. infinity arrives on the scene. i'm the one saying mr. infinity is a figment of their fevered imaginations. driven by an insane loathing of something, what it is, they do not know, but they hate it, they can't describe, they can't perceive it, they just hate it, it makes them foam madly from the mouth.they don't want to face the simple truth. the price of characters on the bazaar would go down in proportion to the amount of sp people were buying from ccp. if ccp were to freely sell unlimited sp, characters are the bazaar would have to undercut ccp to sell, and undercut ccp by the character transfer fee and a premium for having to have somebody else's baggage. and i would be fine with that, however. since you accused me of saying what would happen when the mythical millionaires arrive, there you go, i've now said it.even if the mythical millionaires did arrive, nothing much would change.but the mythical millionaires don't exist, won't arrive and won't destroy utterly the character bazaar. it would be merely proportional. thought i'd better add that last bit because the irrational people who keep diving into this thread seem to be largely incapable of understanding words typed. which kind of makes this edit pointless i suppose."
6/4/2010,"you can find a character with the majority of standings you want. your amassed assets can be transferred easily through the contracts system. your complaint about reputation is the only valid concern i see there, but in your case it could be a benefit at well.it's a shame for the op you took up his cause. he might have been willing to refine the idea through discussion without nearly so much ego or trolling."
6/4/2010,"yes you did, you just didn't mean to. lets try doing this slowly in using simple words you might have less trouble understanding..currently a tiny number of people buy characters off the bazaar. why is this? well good characters off the bazaar cost many isk's, meaning that most purchasers are already quite experienced eve players who want a jump start to a certain skill set they dont have. so a mission runner might just buy a research alt, or a pvp'er might buy a jump freighter pilot. sure you might get an occasional person who joins eve, immediately buys 20 plex's and purchases a l33t omgz titan pilot, but this is a minuscule number of people, because most people aren't going to invest thousands of dollars buying the pilot and ship via plex.now lets look at your desired outcome where a couple of plex gives someone a big training boost. it costs a tiny fraction of the amount a character would, so lots of people are going to do it. if you're an experienced character you've probably got an income of over a bill a month anyway, so whats a few hundred mill towards your training? suddenly 50% of eve is boosting their training, and the number of pilots who can fly the top level ships increases a hundred fold. does this have an adverse effect on the character bazaar? sure it does, although there will always be a market for people who need a specific skill set immediately, but overall trashing the bazaar doesn't matter anyway. what does matter is that you've just changed a fundamental aspect of the game and made it so any character can advance in a much reduced period of time. because you've also made it very cheap and easy to do so, now the expectation becomes that everyone needs to do this, or they'll be left behind.pros of this idea: impatient noobs get to feel a sense of false accomplishment. ""i can haz carrierz too!!""we get to enjoy the tears as they emoragequit. ""you blewd up my new carrier! again!"" cons of this idea:[*]everyone runs out of new skills to train in a year[*]everyone gets bored[*]everyone leavesseriously dude, let it go. that time it takes you to train up for the next shiny ship is time you should be using to learn how to fly your current one anyway. every new class of ships presents you with a steep ass learning curve of how to get the best out of it. if you're ready for a new class of ship every 2 weeks then you aren't flying the ones you have properly. there's a reason why new players always rush to get the next big thing and then inevitably lose it a day or two later. that's a big eve learning moment, and the people who stay around tend to be the ones that pick up on that lesson."
6/4/2010,"no. i didn't. get over it. i say repeatedly. the millionaires aren't out there waiting to pounce.get over it. get over it. get over it. i answered that silly point once. and once only. becuase you were dumb enough to accuse me of answering it. get over it. get over it. get over it.because the millionaires aren't out there, like i keep saying.so you gone from accussing me of agreeing with the infinity dollars / infinity sp argeument to agreeing with me that there is no well of cash just ready to **** up eve the moment ccp let them. you are bizare. .stop.hammertime.suddenly 50% of eve is boosting their trainingand the number of pilots who can fly the top level ships increases a hundred foldnow you're back to weird bonkers randomly pulling numbers out of thin air.100 times the number of top level ship pilots!!!!!!!!!!awesome!well, for a start they keep saying they want good fights. well, they might get them, but they don't want good fights really, they just want to win really. anyhow, if there, and let me just lol again while i say one hundred times the number of top level ship pilots lawl, yes of course, lol, anyway, 100x times = 100x the number of titans that need building. therefore, not 100x the number of titans in space. the emphasis shifts to minerals. what?! it's a closed system!? dammit!according to you. fetch me the number on the number of people who quitted at titan level, and the numbers who quitted before titan level. poll them, ask them why they quit, then if it comes up in your favour, i will accept your list.lol. so, nobody ever blew anybody up in a fancy ship they didn't know how to fly huh? this line is pure crap. why did you type it? why should everybody gain sp at the same rate because of this line? because we all learn equally quickly? weak.so why do people in c&p keep saying it's not sp that matters, if it's sp that matters?seriously, the hypocrisy is amazing. nothing fundamental changes. if people want sp they can buy them today, just not from ccp. nothing changes. but something apparently does change, just nobody seems to know what it is."
6/4/2010,"pro 1. ) char bazaar does this without having them still have to play and learn how to survive even when that time to learn is half. half > 0 pro 2. ) char bazaar would cause this more, proof of concept is point 1 a line above.con 1) i currently have 296 out of iirc 397 skills trained to at least level 1. for me to get the other 101 skills will take 1034 days 172 and 250 in gunnery and spaceship command alone respectively.con 2) you get bored from not being able to do things / only being able to do 1 thingcon 3)why would everyone leave?also your bit about everyone being able to fly the top level ships is bs, i can currently fly every caldari ship other then freighters and transports effectively. yet you don't see me trolling around in a levi, or phoenix, or widow or anything. just because i can fly it doesn't mean i will"
6/4/2010,"are you being deliberately obtuse?as i pointed out (and you seem to have completely ignored) most people who buy characters off the bazaar currently, are existing eve players who buy characters with isk they've earned in game, not by selling mass plex for isk.no you're again mixing up isk with rl money. dollars are not the only way to get isk. older players especially already have quite a lot of these. because of the time it takes to earn sp (and the lack of cheap shortcuts) the number of players with huge sp totals is very small compared to the number with less, like a pyramid shape if you will. if you boost sp training, you basically flatten out the top of that pyramid shape.so in fact you want a vast number of titan/mom pilots who don't have the isk or the contacts to actually get the ship they've just quick trained to fly. awesome, i'm sure that'll make them much more satisfied and happy. i didn't say training to titan made you want to quit, i said running out of skills completely probably would. currently the time it takes to get every skill in the game is so long (over 4 years iirc) that it generally just isn't going to happen, as new skills are added fairly often.i love the way you try and reverse an argument and then attack that instead of the original, it's funny to watch. inexperienced pilots in expensive ships = lots of death and gnashing of teeth. it's not a complex thing to understand.sp isn't what makes a good combat pilot, which is why this idea fails. experience is generally what makes a good combat pilot. that doesn't mean however that sp doesn't have a purpose, it does. it provides a gradual opening up of game content and provides timing for the players progression into increasingly powerful and difficult to use ships. you do ramble a lot of nonsense."
6/4/2010,"except the high price of characters means this is used by only a minute number of people compared to the overall userbase. if an occasional rich idiot wants to spend thousands on a titan char and then gets popped the next week, who cares? so why on earth make it so everyone can fly them all really quickly if they're not even going to fly them anyway?! not that they could afford the ships in the first place."
6/4/2010,"nope read the whole thing. apparently you are unable to grasp the simple concept that it wouldn't be ""some people"" doubling their sp gain, it would be ""all people"" doing it except noobs who couldn't afford it. to say otherwise is as stupid as saying only ""some people"" train learning skills.and for the record, i am also against the character bazaar as anyone who knows me in-game would tell you, therefore congratulations on *again* inserting foot into mouth because of your puerile assumptions. as one of the ""literally tens of thousands of millionaire bastards"" starting eve a while back, i never felt any desire to buy a character.this stupidity perfectly summarizes why you don't get it. why don't you propose something for the market next? i'm sure it will be enlightening, helpful and totally an original idea."
6/4/2010,"as to the first bit the prices are not really that high. this head for example would start at somewhere over 10 billion isk as it has caldari titan at five so its special, most usual char bazaar characters are not that special though. you pretty much pay cost of skillbooks + amount of plex it ate + some extra or it wouldnt be worth it. if your looking off a pure isk sink this plex thing would be pretty close for pilots that are not looking to make a killing. take this one for example linkagewith that current layout it took him 9.22 months to train sixteen million sp, and that is if he was able to remap and move his stats around enough to make his spaceship, and learning train at the same rate of 2409 sp per hour. he would need a tenth plex to give him a rounded month as the .22 doesn't come free most likely as he has 300k sp of uneeded trading skills for a pure miner which would have canceled out the 14 day free trial, account came before double training as the head was made in 07.so out of the 3.5 billion your paying 3 billion in plex. and another 50 or so million just in skillbooks (learning skills and exhumers is 45 million all alone.) so this guy is making a whole 450 million extra isk off of 10 months of doing crap. if thats your overhead a pilot training double speed will get this one in 5 months and cost 10 plex, will have the same skillbook price so the difference in price breaks down to 90 million a billing period, or 3 million a day that he could have saved, wow. that's a lot.as to the second half i used ships because you used ships. no one in their right mind is going to train for them like that since they know they wont be able to afford the titan prolly with normal training much less double. but say you really want to take your laser boat and put t2 lasers on it. for me to be able to fire that t2 laser it will take me 82 days, i might see that as a reason to spend 300 million and cut that down to 52 days. notice id did not say 41 days as i will most likely not spend the money on another plex to do half of a half month for the one skill i need faster. you and everyone else here on the no side of the fence seems to think that everyone will be doing this every month of all time they play. where i think the yes people realize its more of an as needed thing instead of a because i can thing."
6/4/2010,this conversation gets funnier the longer it goes on.
6/4/2010,"except not that many people (in the overall scheme of things) can find 3.5b to spend on a purchase. an awful lot more people can find 300m a month. so you'd train slower than necessary because you probably wont want to use the skills for a while? isn't it a lot more likely that most peoples train of thought is going to be something like 'i'll be able to fly a titan, and who knows maybe something will happen so i can'. sure its not likely, but millions of people play the lottery each week on much worse odds. anyway titans aside, people are definately going to be training to caps extra fast and getting the whole range of support and weapon skills much faster. then they're going to reach a point where its all trained and theres no more skills to aim for other than maybe each races titan. i just dont see any reason why its a good idea to make character development run its course in half the time. one of the big joys of eve is that it has such a long running end game. why spoil that?"
6/4/2010,yeah because no one is noticing that the real answer would be to remove plex from the game. plex is:1. micro transaction2. not an isk sink. if you were to make char bazaar and this idea run off of straight isk it would give the game a huge isk sink to play with. making this stuff work off of plex in both situations does not cause any isk to leave the system as all you all you are doing is paying money to get the plex. if you paid it off of in game generated isk that is huge hole.
6/4/2010,"without plex it still wouldn't be an isk sink though, as it's just moving isk from one player to another. like the bazaar itself though, plex have a secondary real world purpose, in taking a normally black market industry (game currency purchasing) and giving players a way to do it that gives money to ccp rather than to some gold farmers."
6/4/2010,as a bitter old vet with loads of sp i dont support this proposal because i'm bitter and hate everything and want to keep my sp lead on other players so i may call them noobs in game and laugh at their noobish ways while myself being all smug and bitter
6/4/2010,"well for the plex for double training time it would be a sink as the money would go to the sink as it would get removed 300 mil at a time. and for char bazaar it prolly would <50% the time the same way as someone could then make his trasaction like that one in half the time if he were to give the account the 300 million times x months to train another copy faster.but if they have all the sp but none of the experiance you can laugh at their noob ways as you blow up a more expensive ship they shouldnt be in. granted char bazaar would do the same thing..if you guys havent figured it out yet i'm against both, only thing i would support is having grind skilling, idk about you guys but i already have to grind missions, ratting, plex whatever to make money. so saying that leveling by killing things would introduce grinding is ******ed because we all already do it anyways."
6/4/2010,"you're that told me i was the one who explained how the millionaires with infinite dollars will destroy eve with infinite sp. and in your previous post you tried to explain to me that i had said that by explaining to me that there are people out there who will destroy eve the moment ccp sell spand now you say i'm the one being obtuse. well, i'll skip read the rest of your post to see if you have explained yourself. if you haven't, consider it ignored. you start making sense, with real sentences that don't contradict yourself, and we can talk, but i suspect the rest of what you typed is as equally mental as what you have managed to type previously.*skip read complete. what a face palm. learn english, come back."
6/4/2010,"and to say that is to say that i've never had to tell anybody to train the learning skills. which i have. so there. anything else you'd like to invent in your own head and set forth to the earth in the hope it might make sense outside your head?to say that is also to say that just because everybody can buy plex with dollar and sell them for isk everybody will, which they don't. i know this, because again, i don't.so your assertion is based on the hope that you are correct while all similar circumstances point to the opposite. congratulations. you failed to think your point through before making it. i seriously doubt you are a millionaire. oh, you cannot understand and you thought i was on about isk in that sentence, oh dear. this could run long.this stupidity perfectly summarizes why you don't get it. why don't you propose something for the market next? i'm sure it will be enlightening, helpful and totally an original idea.before embarassing you publicly on that one, please make it all the sweeter for me by explaining why you think ccp's dislike of learning skills does matter to the sp gain rate instead of just calling me stupid. go on, i double dare you, because this will be sweet."
6/4/2010,"first, punctuation for the love of god. second, if you can't see how everyone would do this if given the option you're a moron. third, while doubtless there would be the occasional person who didn't do it for reasons of their own (or simply not being aware of the option), ignorance of game mechanics would make them (like you) a moron.so you are in fact trying to build your case off potential statistical outliers, rather than how it would affect the average player. that's bright. whatever you say.i'll do it in character seeing as i'm pretty bored and you've clearly demonstrated that logic, reading and math aren't your strong points. not to mention you've blatantly ignored other responders' attempts to explain it. perhaps you'll do better with sesame street.ccp: ""oh boy was handing out learning skills a mistake""curious forum troll: ""why is that?""ccp: ""well we created a class of skills that are virtually required and that wasn't our intent at all, not to mention it seriously accelerates sp gain to the detriment of our long-term fiscal viability.""cft: ""what do you mean?""ccp: ""well we cut down the time it takes to master anything by (at minimum) 1/2 or even more for people who grind the skills to 5's and then stay in the game for an extended period of time.""cft: ""oh well since they're in now you can't take them away or i'll break out the whaaambulance in a way you've never seen before.""ccp: ""yes we know, but at least we'll never make this mistake again.""but hey, whatever. the best part of this game is knowing people like you absolutely never get what they want, but seem to always get what they deserve. rage on my friend!"

6/4/2010,"i don't know much about you guys but i know you guys are allies with atlas. so when you guys came down to 0.0 did you guys not first blue atlas to come down? i really doubt you guys could have got a foothold with fighting atlas or aaa since they have so many pets/allies.i have never seen a ""new"" alliance from empire come to 0.0 without joining a block, most of the time aaa citizens or atlas pets over nc these days.i am not worried about old vets or whatever. i am talking about new alliances coming from empire, they all just go and join aaa citzens and they are happy."
6/4/2010,yes i can see how removing an alliances ability to dock in space would allow small new alliances to forge their own way in 0.0.oh wait no thats completely contradictory. instead of simply taking the space back from a small alliance they would take the space back and kill any stations they erected.
6/4/2010,people like this is why i am glad ankh was made csm leader. they just want to protect their 0.0 oligopolies.
6/4/2010,"nice troll, but i'm not gonna bite."
6/4/2010,oh look... yet an another 0.0 nooblet.please... go troll somewhere else.
6/4/2010,"not supporting. there might be alot of stations in eve but they are stragic points where reds to your alliance and mess up your markets, you lose one every ones stuff thats in it is practicly gone too, and their services are essentual to 0.0 life, repair, jump clone, updating clones, reprocessing facilitys cause the pos refinerys suck and can only process ore instead of moduals and ships as well. as far as how hard they are you make, you fly a frieghter with an egg in it though 10-20 0.0 systems and youll see how hard people have to work to get them."
6/4/2010,since it mentioned ankhuglydumbahaha it is an obvious troll. 0/10.
6/4/2010,"assuming you are not a troll and also believing you actually believe the above ill try to advise/explain;re the 2 major factions comment, nope there isnt eve is just as colourful as the histories of rl each of these so called factions are tbh made of of a myriad of differant entities who for the moment follow which ever 'faction' they wish,ie if you are a corp and wish to survive in 0.0 the corp joins a alliance that alliance also makes friends for mutual convienience and forms a coalition , that is natural human behaviour and cannot be changed.-each and everyone one of your solutions would not work at all as players would just adapt and return to coalitional groups and the blob - evidence of this was yulai , ccp wanted to get rid of areas of space where people collectively grouped together, ccp failed and jita was formed.everything was done by ccp to prevent this but obviously 'yulai' just moved.whence everything you do to the game to change it how you envisage how the game should be will fail.-also you seem to think that station building is a quick and easy job to do, from what little involvement ive had and seen its a colosal undertaking which requires man many hours of labour, planning and collective organisation you my friend cannot even fathom.-re destroying player owned stations - i think this was considered and talked about but i believe (subject to being corrected) the station becomes embedded into the game programme permanantly and therefore cannot be removed,but i can understand why some would want the player owned stations to be destroyable like any other 0.0 structure that is player owned/built but you will have players docked, countless m3 of players belongings dating back to possibly when the station was built = just wont happen/not possible."
6/4/2010,"this was already raised, and passed. it was, in fact, the sixth issue taken up in csm history. you'll be happy to note that ankh did, in fact, vote in favour. but there's no need to raise it again."

6/4/2010,"as a former gaylente pilot that switched to amarr due to utter suckiness of gallente weapons, i support this."
6/4/2010,"supported for multiple reasons.the easiest thing to do would be to allow for one waypoint to be set as the ""destination"", which would be easy and commonly used. the more general thing would be to specify that one station has to come before another station. both of these would be helpful.from a gameplay point of view the benefits would be obvious, and from a computing point of view, even one constraint can greatly improve the processing time."
6/4/2010,"i would like to propose that the ability to create or rent shared hangers be added to npc stations and outposts. the main reason this is needed is the fact that corporation hangers are often not useful for the majority of members. corporation hanger access can be limited because of security concerns or simply because corporate offices can located in systems that have no real use for many members. although i hate to bring it up (because i support moving people out of npc corporations): there is also the issue that npc corporations have no offices. clearly this heavily affects those who ""multi-box"" but can also benefit and even promote players running a mini-operation with friends (such as wormhole exploration). trying to ""share"" items among characters can be a fairly difficult task, especially when everyone isn't on at the same time. what i would like to see is the ability to rent a hanger and invite other players to use your hanger via something like a fleet invite. the hanger and invites/retractions could then be managed by the renter at the station. the rent should be similar to the price of using contracts to exchange goods during the month, possibly higher for the convenience. of course the rent could also be variable based on the invited users. i would like to see either a flat fee like 250,000 isk/month or a variable fee such as 100,000 isk/month/user.--i am sure this has been brought up before but i could not find an older thread on eve-search to reference."
6/4/2010,"this is a rather minor issue. there are much more important things to focus on. however, you raise a very important point. this is a space game where you have slaves and computers and robots and stuff to do your work. and for some reason you cannot even divide your assets into folders without purchasing separate cans, which in turn make it difficult to contract out items later, and other downsides. the whole item usage interface would need a serious uptune, including your proposal. shouldn't be hard in a universe like this (neither is it that hard to code).. wouldn't need any fees at all imo.as proposed here, i cannot support your idea though. renting hangars for temporary shared use? nah, useless. we want real upgrades, not pay-for-polish. more importantly, you should not have to grind isk (which equals real life money = pay) to get a better user interface. it should be in ccp's interest to have the best user interface possible. still, i'd rather they removed the lag and many other things before i see this change."
6/4/2010,"asking for a high price is not a scam. if you agree to pay a lot, then it's your mistake, since you agreed to it. people doing so is not a problem. someone asking for a lot does not do anything to you. you being willing to pay a lot dos. the font being absolutely horrible is a problem, since it causes people to accidentally pay an amount of isk different than what they thought they were.also, as a note to a couple of people in this thread: what the us government does is about as relevant here as how many times have i taken a **** during june 1997."
6/4/2010,"this seems to be better solved with an improvement to the ui, not with an artifical market cap.so, no support to this, but absolutely thumbs up to allowing people with difficulty seeing the damn text to change fonts or sizes or something.consider supporting this thread."
6/4/2010,i support a separate login for web services. but account services and in game imo must remain the same or allow account sharing.
6/4/2010,"/signedthe accounts of eve and eve-gate and these forums should be seperated - in my opinion, the only case in which the account credentials should be used, is to log into the game itself!yep ... couldn't find a ""visible"" link to eve-gate, too ... this should be fixed as well ;)"
6/4/2010,excellent idea.
6/4/2010,"counter-point: your inference is that; the existence of killmails in-game, the presence of the corporate recorded losses/kills tabs and the api for killmails means ccp cares about your killmails.ergo, we can infer that self-destruct not generating a killmail is ""working as intended."" qed, self-destruct does not need balancing.is self-destruct annoying? oh yes. you only have to look at the venom it generates in threads like these, the faked mails when someone s/d's their carrier, etc. given the changes in insurance, it's likely to be far less of an issue though.on the points re records of engagement - if your carrier victim initiates self destruct, you have 2 minutes to fraps/screenshot it. mail the link to his ceo, post on the forums, whatever. you forced x to self-destruct. that's your victory. everything else is just fluff."
6/4/2010,yes agreed! it will also give traders something else to buy and move and trade!
6/4/2010,what?
6/4/2010,"to be fair, at lot of it was just trash talking, devoid of any real, concrete arguments.can i ask what some of the sensationalism and lying was all about? i wasn't there to witness it personally, and i'm quite curious what was said. i keep hearing all about how she terrorized local in some system or another."
6/4/2010,it's all in her thread and doesn't really need repeating in detail here but primarily she implied that every other csm candidate wished to move level 4's to low sec and she was the only one fighting against this.
6/4/2010,"ah, so this has nothing to do with the talk of 'local spamming'? i'll try to find it, thanks gladys. if anyone can point me to the thread where ank claims the other candidates want to move level 4's to low-sec, it'd be much appreciated.i've searched around and found a couple assembly hall proposals where the move to low-sec is suggested, and at least one thread where ank refers to these proposals, but i can't find anything where she's claiming any other candidates support this idea."
6/4/2010,my understanding is she mostly did so in eve mails that she mass-spammed in trade and mission hubs.
6/4/2010,"good issue, but this isn't the right place. you want the assembly hall, not jita park."
6/4/2010,"why do people keep saying the rifter is the only good t1 frig?after flying it for a while (about a month on my old character), and comparing it with my current amarr frigs, i find i kill things in my current frigs before they even get within weapon range, which i couldn't do well on the rifter.maybe its just me..."
6/4/2010,yup.

'cause lemme get this straight--u're gonna weaken concord to be destroyable and let the players do the policing, who can then take advantage of that by blobbing and killing concord and everyone in high sec. that's when it actually becomes unsafe for everyone. wasn't it like that years ago when ppl would just tank/kill concord and meanwhile, kill whoever they wanted? yeah, great idea to really turn high sec into low sec... now ppl can clear entire belts worth of miners, gate camp, and attack marauders long enough to blow them up...and still live. u're lucky i can't sig that entire ""suggestion"" of yours 'cause u just made my day."
6/5/2010,"/signi have seen this problem emerge before, and it tends to take far too long to fix (usually alienating the player base to a competitor/alternative in the interim).ccp has an opportunity to reverse that trend, if they stand up to the problems and start tackling them. the latency issue is a start, its being solved in small chunks but at least there are changes being made."

6/5/2010,supported. nothing would make me happier then to see an expansion that is dedicated to bug fixes and addressing concerns with current mechanics (not adding new ones).
6/5/2010,"absolutely supported.the quantity over quality procedure needs to be turned around as soon as possible. to some, it currently seems like ccp are running around with their arms in the air to patch on a new half-finished feature here, partial band-aid bug fix there, etc.as i have said elsewhere, i genuinely am worried about the future for eve and ccp. i care about the game, and want to see it succeed. but once mature, strong and direct competition enters the market (of which some are getting close to beta or release), i honestly don't see an appeal for players to continue to cling to and develop the fruits of their labor in eve.ccp can only draw on the patience and good will of the player base for so long, before hopes and promises of revisiting, fixing and developing existing features, such as wormholes, faction warfare, cosmos missions, lowsec incentives, dominion treaties, sov upgrades and expandability, starbases, t3 iterations, industry, game physics, fleet formations/tactics, bounty systems, and so on, begins to grow thin and players become disenchanted with the whole repeating process of release first, promise to iterate on the content as time goes along. the iteration never seems to come, as ccp gets distracted by a major feature that they feel is central to pushing the game towards a milestone or one of their visions. the current example being pi which is required for dust 514.there has been talk of excellence, agile development, scrum and so forth. but it feels as if the same ccp-esqe handling of features and content is applied to the implementations of these terms.excellence, as already discussed earlier in this thread, held deep promises in the minds of the players of real changes happening at ccp.we have seen examples of scrum and agile development being trampled on at a moments notice, never being properly followed through to commit to a streamlined development process with resources being directed where they really should be given most.i only hope my support is counted and that ccp will read."

6/5/2010,100% agree
6/5/2010,"i strongly support this.i am not near as convinced the 6-month development cycle is much to blame. you could use scrum and get two releases a year out and polish and finish (or in the case of the ui, begin) just fine. and you could do one release every 18 months and get distracted by new shinies and still have most of the effort on beginnings. 6 months cycles allow you to react better to the hardware and software and competitive landscape. ccp can say that in the next 6 months they can live without dx11, 64 bit, multi-core/thread and native mac client. with 18 month cycles that means a couple of months ago you were drawing up an 18 month schedule to begin in june for the only release between now and summer 2013. it is not quite so obvious that single-threaded, 32-bit dx9 thru 2013 is optimal. the recent example is apple turning out several versions of their os which was more effective than the excessively long vista cycle. interestingly, apple announced the plans for the snow leopard operating system as no new features. tl;dr: shorter development cycles are not as efficient (more betas/launches) but should be more responsive. regardless of the development cycle, ccp just needs to devote some time to polish and followup."

6/5/2010,"long time player of eve, basicly 3 month after release. running and paying for alot of accounts. but my loyalty doesnt lie with ccp anymore it does with the friends in my community that came through but that group of people have steadily been declining over last few years, and i'm telling you more and more are leaving this game.step up ccp and start doing what its needed and here is a hint, its not new content. make eve work like you have promised the last 3<U+FFFD> years."
6/5/2010,"ccp have given us a great game that will continue for many many years more, and if excellence truly is realized, then it will live even longer!"
6/5/2010,"100% agreedeven if bugs don't effect my style of gaming that much, but i would appriciat more love to the content that we already have. in my eyes pi could have waited till the month of dust coming out."
6/5/2010,"if nothing else, just spend 1 full release cycle doing nothing but bug fixes. the player base will love you for it."
6/5/2010,++ can't really add anything productive other than my support.

6/5/2010,i support this topic
6/5/2010,definitely.a lot of eve is so rough around the edges.
6/5/2010,"yes.. yes.. more of this...i would be happy to see a full year of patches that flushes out bugs, makes tweaks, and completes on the unfulfilled promises of the last three patches. i thought a year of excellence actually meant fixing what was already there not adding new features like pi. yes the sov system, mail system, standing issues, and mineral balances needed changing and we are all happy for them.. but the pi system could have been pushed back for a approach that completed sov changes, standings, and treaties.i feel bad for ccp on the faction war front... fewer players are involved in faction war's pvp side then any single region of 0.0 and this is a milti-region pvp arena that is open to the public for all to partake in. something has to be done to make faction war worth more then just running missions for special faction gear otherwise it is just another npc faction corporation in eve."
6/5/2010,"completely agreed. having run a reasonably sized corp, i can attest that at least 1 member every-single-day comes out with some variation on this theme in a frustrated response to one 'feature' or another. by far the most common complaint i've heard in regards to eve from long term players."
6/5/2010,1
6/5/2010,"i've been playing eve since 2006, and i can say without hesitation that it is the single best space mmog currently active. obviously it has dominated the market for a very long time, with little in the way of competition. almost no games (of any genre) can match it in sheer economic depth.unfortunately, lack of competition seems to have made ccp a little uncareful. most of the ""new"" content they release, is just faulty revamps of current systems. wormholes are great, but theyre just really hard pve mixed with extra-null null-sec. (dont get me wrong, i love w-holing). everything they release is a new version of something already existing in game. ccp should realize how much difference improving current content and expanding current content can be to a market, especially with a game as old as eve. right now they are releasing ""new"" content based on glitchy ""old"" content.looking forward to the 0.0 changes promised for tyranis, hope ccp follows through with them.p.s. the little radar on my scorpion is win."
6/5/2010,"on damn time ccp start taking care of stuff to still make it work, and stop making stuff usueless to play with just for the sake of giving out new!"

6/5/2010,"lol, pure genius, but why stop there. we can also have learning skills that help the learning skills that help your learning skills train faster for mad leet training."
6/5/2010,"yo dawg, we heard you like learning, so we put your learning on your learning so you can learn while you learn.anyway. personally, i think learning skills are an unnecessary isk and time sink for new players, and should go. however, for those of us that have already learned them, i also think that we should get a ""training bonus"" equal to the amount of points we've already spent in learning, so we can distribute that sp (and the time!) elsewhere when they are removed."
6/5/2010,"of course they will remove them and make your gameplay slower so you can suscribe for longer. kind of. this is an elegant solution tho, so supported."
6/5/2010,if ccp are indeed looking to remove learning skills then i too would like a sp boost equal to the sp trained in learning.i support lp replacement. either in a short skill train boost in game or a web based one time sp skill plan creation and completion.so if they are doing away with learning it stands to reason they are doing away with attributes. what are they going to be doing with 1-5 slot implants?

6/5/2010,"i'd support 23 hours. 2-4 hours is way, way too short."
6/5/2010,another option might be allowing 2 clone jumps per 48 hrs...
6/5/2010,"please reduce it!12 hours or even less, it's what keeps a lot of carebears out of pvp really. and kept me out for a long time.pve clone with +5 implants, nope wont risk that in lowsec or 0.0 so never even set foot into lowsec or 0.0 and the 24 hour timer was pain in arse. cause most times it wound up like this.corp pvp's todayjumpclone and is readywe make couple runs and wipe when group wipes everyone sorta goes back off to do their own thing.now stuck in pvp clone and a jumpclone wasted while i wait for timer.then jumpclone back to the +5 implants and decide nope not gonna pvp for long time or if ever.i wouldnt say all but a lot of ""carebears"" see it the same way. if the jumpclone timer was reduced it was be so much easier to get carebears into lowsec and 0.0 since they would have the ease of which to go between implant clone and pvp clone little more quickly and easily.anyhow i would love to see the timer reduced by half or even more."
6/5/2010,"the hilarious disparity between implant (and thus training time) risk in empire and 0.0 (you have to try to lose your pod in lowsec) is another matter entirely, but tweaking jumpclones isn't the answer to that.i'd support a small reduction in the clone timer to something like 22 or 23 hours to help accommodate people's daily schedules, but no more."
6/5/2010,i'd support a skill that if you got to level 5 would reduce the time to 12 hours.
6/5/2010,"after thinking about this, i think it would be a better idea to scrap the idea of tying bounty to agent quality. it would be simpler to tie bounty to system sec status. in addition to my proposed dynamic quality, it would still mean that lowsec missions have huge payouts, 0.5 and 0.6 systems (commonly on the edge of lowsec) are now more popular because they give better payouts than 0.9, and missioning in 0.9 space is still worse than it is now.0.5 space has much longer concord response time, increasing the risk of hisec missions. the 0.5 agents which happen to be nowhere near lowsec will sharply decrease in quality because of the influx of mission runners, decreasing lp payouts while not sharply decreasing total mission payouts. if 0.5 bounties are set to what current bounties are, then most of the hisec mission runner's income won't have changed; the players just have moved to less safe space. the end.but what happens when every mission runner in the game suddenly starts making half the lp due to lower quality agents? lp store purchases slow down, lp-purchased items go up in price and lp becomes more valuable. agents in 0.9 will start to look attractive again (but not to everybody), and agents near lowsec will start to look attractive the first time (but not to everybody), as their higher quality due to less use will mean that they pay out more of the now-valuable lp. players spread out as they decide what's most important to them, in true eve fashion.lp will obviously fluctuate up and down in value, especially as players first get accustomed to the system, but it in the long run it will inevitably balance out.dynamic quality would be enough to send players elsewhere (but still inevitably in 0.8-0.9) if they want lp. thus if ccp is looking to spread mission runners around, dynamic quality will help. tying bounty to sec status will move mission hubs to 0.5 and 0.6 areas away from lowsec. if ccp is looking to increase the risk for mission running and thus improve the balance of this profession compared to other hisec professions, tying bounties to system sec status to help. making both changes at once will achieve both of these desirable goals, as players move closer to lowsec for higher bounties, and spread around upper-security hisec for more lp.since i'm also a part-time pirate, i can't help but notice that rat bounties will also get a boost. i know a lot of people who would like to see more people ratting in lowsec ;)"
6/5/2010,"stop this socialist think pattern! geez, you are like ccp iceland socialists.don't force people to behave the way you like, make them want to! make it attractive to go to low/0 sec !"
6/5/2010,"i like, but:1) don't try to lure missioners to lowsec. it won't work.2) some of the most common questions in the official in-game help chat is about finding agents, whether ""how do i pick what corp to run missions for"" ""how do i know when i can use a higher level agent"" or ""how can i get my standings up fast."" those were the kinds of questions pushed me into mining as a rookie. add an effective in-game agent finding tool before you add dynamic agent quality.3) the standings required to access an agent are dependent on their level and quality. it would suck noodles to be able to use an agent one day and not have the standings the next day. ideas for a fix for this one?"
6/5/2010,"i don't like this idea as it has a major impact on my sandbox. here's the problem, and an alternate solution to discuss.a problem - one of my main eve activities is missioning, and when i can't find anything worth exploring, and don't have the corp backup for low/wh-space, i'll mission. i also trade a fair bit using the loot & salvage. as a result, i have maybe a dozen ships that i use for missioning/salvaging/looting, and a hangar full of misc. modules & ammo for varied fits. if we go to a fully dynamic system, i'll regularly face moving a dozen ships (from interceptors to battleships and blockade runners) large distances and need to manage market orders/cargo runs over big distances. as will my corp. this would not be fun. i'd be more likely to drop missioning from my activities altogether.alternate proposal: all the complaints about agents & missions are about either the concentration of players, or the isk faucet. here's the simple solution - an agent will only give any given player n missions per day. kills macros, doesn't affect casual or mixed-play style characters, retains some sense of market hubs, but makes min-maxers or 24/7 players look into other activites as well as missioning. this doesn't deny people their sandbox style, it just makes them take a break if they lean heavily on the activity to the detriment of the rest of the sandbox ecosystem."
6/5/2010,"lol, your solution creates the problem you're claiming would exist. if you can do n missions per day then people will be forced to cluster into the mission hubs, giving a huge boost to caldari/amarr missions and a huge huge huge nerf to gallente/minmatar. so you either have to move to a big mission hub with multiple lvl 4's per station or you don't waste your time doing missions at all.the dynamic quality would not force anyone to move anywhere, he's proposing maybe a 20% reduction in payout at mission hubs. yes you'll be able to make more isk if you move away from the hubs (the whole point of dynamic quality) but the hubs will still be popular because agent quality alone does not create a hub. and as a trader, the less busy the hub the more opportunity for large profit margins."
6/5/2010,"1. i see this as a way of bringing some balance to hisec missions, with a side effect of silencing players who whine that there's no benefit to using lowsec agents or agents near lowsec.2. i agree that it needs to be easier to find agents in-game.3. ideally, quality would only go up or down by one point per day or week or whatever. players armed with that knowledge could decide accordingly which agents to talk to. as of now, players with negative enough faction standings can only use negative quality l1 agents, and that limit would have to be changed to all of l1.nobody said you were entitled to play the game exactly as you have for the last 2 years with no change whatsoever. this change may result in a change to how mission runners play the game.every patch, ships are rebalanced, leading to a change in play style for pvp players. the nano nerf basically upended all of pvp. changes to drone loot have made the drone regions much less valuable to live in, potentially forcing entire alliances to move. an entire alliance, stagnant and full of do-nothing directors, lost all of its sov space a few months ago because they couldn't adapt to the new sov system.even miners have had to change their play styles as ore values go up and down, suicide ganking becomes more prevalent, etc. all these players have to adapt to a changing game, so why shouldn't you?if a player wants to run 10 missions but is only allowed to run 5 per day, they'll move to a system/constellation that has multiple l4s. or they'll stick with their main agent but move the 6 jumps it might take to find a new l4. so you either have: even larger concentrations of players in mission hubs, or you have players being forced to move anyways.under my proposed system, ""mixed-style"" players can simply choose to do their missions out of the same stations they've been doing them and accept the reduced income, with the assumption that they'll continue to get more elsewhere."
6/5/2010,carebears hate being suicide ganked and want it nerfed in any way possible c/d?
6/5/2010,suicide gankers are the real carebears here. they want their form of pvp payed for and no risk except for a little sec loss which isn't a risk because it will happen!
6/5/2010,i'll just support this then.
6/5/2010,agree - it will help suicide ganking to become a profession that requires a slightly greater degree of skill with target selection.
6/5/2010,got a thumbs up from me. i dont know all the in's and out's of this. i just gave it a thumbs up based solo on i dont know one insurance company that would pay a claim like the one made when something like this happends to a car in real life.
6/5/2010,"would it help if it was called something else than insurance?even though it has been explained over 9,000 times that eve ""insurance"" is nothing like real life insurance in any way, people still seem to get hung up on the word."
6/5/2010,"im with bellum on this one. although i took full advantage oh highsec lvl5s :). my poor 100mill an hour :(as for the lvl5 moaners, use an unprobable tengu and scimi combo"
6/5/2010,because the people who think it's worth it to do them will do them.i agree there needs to be better rewards for missions that send you into lowsec. see
6/5/2010,"i do sympathise somewhat with the op's point of view. after all, if lo-sec agents no longer give missions in hi-sec, then why should hi-sec agents give missions in lo-sec?the real issue still remains the nature of missions, though. as long as they're pretty much straight up tank vs dps, then we'll have these problems.cure the disease, not the symptoms: support mission reform so that we have interesting, varied missions that dont simply require slow monotanked bs to stay in the same place for 15 mins."
6/5/2010,"the idea has yet needing refinement simply because there have yet any logical arguments to be worth considering. i'm still reading this topic, but i'm busy irl and rarely i'd answer something that's already rebutted which's done remarkably well by some other helpful people. if anything, i'd probably extend the op post so that all the commonly listed arguments here get answered. i might disagree with his opinion but this guy is probably the most honest person on the other side.300m a month, afer 12 months, total 3.6b. are you implying that an awful lot of people can find as much money as not many people can now in 12 months? that's actually quite some many, in the overall scheme of things isnt it? are you implying that ""waiting for skill training to finish"" is equals to ""endgame"" and is enjoyable? *watch paint to dry joke goes here* even then, mind you, current amount of skills takes 30y+ to finish, with new skills constantly being added.first, quote tag is there so that people dont need to scroll up. second, name calling, spelling pricking and ""i dont like"" do not make good argument nor help evading troll detectors.and finally, this suggestion is not made to appeal to probability. it has covered the probability of everyone obtaining plex and try to double their training speed. in the case of such occurence these things will happen: + plex price increase slightly. plex supply is quite finite and remains constant, proven by the amount of plex transactions over time and during the earlier half of this year where plex price suddenly shoot up to over 320. + a large portion of people who are already paying shall buy plex to boost themselves. this shall the extra income to ccp. + some of these people will also join into selling plex because it's profitable. this and the above point eventually settle plex price somewhere. however, considering plex price fluctuation since its conception from nov 2008, it wont be much higher then it is now. + increase in plex price help kill chinese farmers because it both reduce their income after plex and discourage illegal isk trading (cause plex is now better alternative) + eventually people cannot train double speed training anymore because they got into the top 10% players. my personal estimation is, atm, the mark is at 50-60m sp based on how 50% of characters have less then 2m sp, and the rest averaging 20m-ishin the end, the only thing this does is allowing new to medium aged players to lessen the gap with older players if they choose to."
6/5/2010,you know what i would support?pay a plex to make some other player train at half speed for two months. that would be hilarious and awesome.
6/5/2010,wouldnt matter to me because i've been playing eve since 1986 and have like 200 mil sp and can fly everything anyway and have like a 15 year lead on all new players and have nothing left to train anyway so even if that were the case i could still be all smug because i've 400 mil sp
6/5/2010,o/\o
6/5/2010,that number is hugely useless. because the percentage doesnt tell anything about ... alts.e.g. many cyno alts will just have the skills for well lighting a cyno. trading alts will just have the skills for hauling and selling stuff. or your pirate alt which you keep for quiet times in your 0.0 alliance. all that kind of stuff. why would you train more sp than really needed? just so you can loose more when you get podded?so trying to use that number as an argument that we need plexes for double training speed is very very weak.
6/5/2010,"because i can.yes the colour changing idea is good as well, i hate not knowing if it's pressed or not."
6/5/2010,confirming i too am old and feeble.
6/5/2010,"i really like the idea of shift or ctrl or alt click to overheat. the green light should function primarily as an indicator, its too small to be a button!"
6/5/2010,"supported, deactivating the module you're trying to overheat usually loses you your ship or the ship you're trying to kill."
6/5/2010,"well, ccp's made another ""let's be idiots"" change, and it's even in the patch notes.so, if you've got a 200 run project to set up that consumes 10% r.a.m. per run it should consume 20 units. logically you would assume that you could put 20 ram into the joblot location and initiate the job just fine... but no. ohhhh, no ccp has said, freck you, industrialists! you need all 200 units of ram just to initiate the job!, leaving you with 180 units that you can never use! because you need to build another 20 to bring you back up to 200 if you want to set up the same job again.considering it's 40 minutes per unit you've got a substantial investment in time and resources for those 180 units you can never use.proposal: immediately return production requirements to the proper calculation of consumption, not total quantity!oh, and ccp:""it is no longer possible to start a manufacturing job without having the required quantity of ram.""required quantity should be the quantity consumed, not 1 unit for every single run that does not require 100% of every ram component."
6/5/2010,"if players identify it as a bug, it's a bug."
6/5/2010,"yes, this just turned my monthly batch cycle into a complete nightmare.one 30 day batch produces 1600 modules that consume 15% ram per run but it now requires that i have 1600 units of ram just to launch the job. that's almost a week just to produce the ram using a single bp.there is one easy fix if they want to go with this flatly idiotic feature: reduce the components and build time of ram modules to 10% of their current levels, and make all runs consume 1 unit of ram regardless of the item(s) produced. turn ram into a 'fully consumed' component and this change will work as intended.as it is now, it is not working as intended by the original t2 production design (when ram could not be produced, it had to be acquired from mission rewards)."
6/5/2010,as someone who is making an industrial alt this new change is extremely off putting. i plan to make all the components needed for my invention jobs and needing such a huge amount of r.a.m when you don't need a huge amount of r.a.m is totally stupid in my opinion.can we at least hear the reasons for this change or just change it back?

6/5/2010,"in the second alliance tournament qualifier match, hydra had wiped out all but one ship of the opposing team (agony), at which point they made the offer to suicide all their ships in exchange for 3bil isk.some dealings went on, hydra committed suicide, agony won the match. in doing so, agony suddenly had lots of points to go into their next qualifying match, since they had won, but so did hydra since they had wiped out all but one of agony's ships (with ease). so hydra earned a bunch of money, got a whole slew of points, and also made sure that in their next qualifying match, they'll come up against another ""loser"" team (and considering the ease with witch they nearly-won-but-then-accidentally-all-exploded, they should have no problems with such a match) which means that, combined with the points they got from the first match that they ""suddenly"" lost, they'll should have a pretty easy time going on to the quarterfinals.all live and direct in front of the tournament cameras."

6/5/2010,"standing only gains for faction kills is not enough to generate real meaningful sustained pvp in faction war.for the majority of pilots, faction war is just another group of npc corps that they have to join if they want to earn special faction gear, and while there, most do nothing but run missions and avoid all forms of pvp to reduce their personal risk.how about ccp making some level of pvp required along with or in the place of lp and tags for key faction war only items. this will increase the value of faction war only items and increase the pvp activity making it more of the pvp atmosphere ccp originally intended.i am sure you can figure out tons of different ways you could tabulate pvp kills and make those count toward faction items. each kill would have to take in to account the faction war pvp history (or faction kills earned) of the person killed vers the killer, the ship they were flying vers the ship the killer was in, and the number of other assisting ships.the addition of pvp kills would have to be carefully balanced. you can make it as easy or difficult as need be given the faction items market value and time needed to farm up pve lp & tags with the added pvp kills to earn the faction war only items.the fw pvp points should be capable of being converted in to lp at a reasonable rate allowing for a pvp only style of faction war game play. a style where all the lp and fw pvp kill points could be earned through pvp and tags purchased to gain faction war items.like the idea? reply and support it."
6/5/2010,"as an extension to the *press link - have trojan - have account hijacked* we have to enter the name of an additional character on the account when we login to the forums. this does need some knowlage about the account; a bot/trojan network network does not have this knowlage (usually) so they can't access the account. i think this is a rather neat protection.issue:when logging into eve-gate you enter the regular username + password. by doing this you enter the main screen where you can see all the characters in the account.you don't have to enter the name of a toon inside the account to access the information.this renders the feature of the forums where you enter the name of a toon utterly useless. since eve-gate is not a secret of any kind. when the *evil hackers* realize this, the protection feature will be rendered useless.my suggestion is to add a similar feature to eve gate, or a completly different feature to eve-gate. so the protection still can be utilized to avoid abuse of accounts/spam.cheers"

6/5/2010,"i've often thought that more could be done to make the buddy trial invites work better, and i had a couple ideas today that would address a couple issues i've had to recently deal with...1. in-game notificationplease send me a notification when a buddy code is activated and the person has logged in a character on the account. usually they're very lost when they first enter the game, and the simplest chat functions that we take for granted are beyond their intuition. a simple notification that they got it installed and logged in would help a lot.2. secondary means for entering the codesay i'd like to generate a handful of codes to hand out to coworkers or classmates that might be interested in eve. a means of generating the codes for myself, then writing them down, and a url to include with it to type in and manually enter the code, would really help. as it is, i get halfhearted pledges to look at the email when it arrives when they give me their email address. these are people that would otherwise try eve, but don't because it's not *right there* and easy to ignore or forget about. i have a lot of unredeemed buddy codes on my account due to this.3. tertiary means of acquiring the game.first means is to dl it yourself, second is to buy a boxed game at a game store. i'd like a promo-version i can dl and burn to dvd as a disc image. i'd want it to autorun a small windowed app with something akin to the page first-time visitors to eve see, with the butterfly effect video, if not one or two of the latest expansion trailers or dust/incarna vids. this applet would of course be the gui installer as well, with a button to begin the install.it's not about making it easy for idiots to get into eve, it's about making it quick and streamlined for someone to get into eve so that moment they become hooked comes faster.tl;dr:1: if someone i gave a buddy code comes online, send me a notification in-game.2: make buddy codes less email-centric, and more restaurant business meeting napkin friendly.3: give us a marketing package to ""attach"" to a full download of eve's client to burn to dvds to give out."

6/5/2010,"i just recently got back into eve and while i love the game and ccp for what they have acomplished i find it hard to believe that one of the funnest, and as far as a community, simplest ways to keep peace is to infact have a sort of self police force available to players. the bounty system. i shed a tear when i realized that if you wanted revenge and you placed a bounty on a pirates head that you could be infact rewarding the pirate in question because he could take the bounty for himself with an alt. i looked at this issue with many diffrent approaches and i found, in the end, i would need to know some deailed information about my target before i placed a bounty on his/her head. like:1: the cost of his clone2: the replacment costs of his implants3: the price of his ship and it's loadout (at time of death) the reason: so i could hopefully set a bounty high enough to atract compitent bounty hunters to do the task while making it impossable for the marked one to make isk by killing himsself for the reward. none of these are possable, making the bounty system, atleast in my eyes, but to many others as well, broken. i had one idea to fix the issue if it is even possable. this is my idea. have a ccp run and controled bounty office. where ccp workers, in game, hire and fire, bounty hunters off of there cradentials and pilot skills. these people are tracked and there kills recorded so they can be reviewed to see if someone was cheating or if someone was actully fighting for there life. i know it might add up to a decent amount of work, but to have such a wonderful profession available to the eve community that is what many call broken is a tragedy, specially for all the boba fette fans in the world. please let me know about what you think and no matter who it is, lets keep talking about this so ccp can get a working fix into play for there community for which i love so much. closing note: ccp, you really do take good care of us and you have done so much for us, your playing clients and customers. for this i am greatfull. thank you. i just do hope, in so many ways, that this issue could be resolved because if i want to put grief on someone who i personaly dont stand a chance aganst, i should have an outlet to express my rage...in the form of a paycheck, that i know is going to the hero who killed my grief and not to the one who is giving it to me.magnetica rose"

6/5/2010,"please, please. either cut back to one expansion per year, with 6 months devoted to bug fixes/existing content development. this, or significantly increase your staff, so that a large enough team can work on existing content development, re-balancing, and backlogged bugs."

6/5/2010,"personally, i'm in favor of individual paint designs for people to decide on, although a corp-wide paint scheme could be an option. i think both should be a back-burner idea, one that they work on when not necessarily busy with other, more important matters. it sounds like a nice idea, but i think that it could be tweaked a bit:individual pilots would have a chance to opt out of the color schemepilots would have control over the design (ie. have only one stripe of the corp/alliance colors, or the whole ship painted, tiger stripes, camo, etc.)it would just be the logo, and thus subtle enough to not get people upset that they're flying bright purple domi's and junk. ultimately, if it's something that's going to be forced on players instead of being an option just for those who want it, then i can't support it at all."
6/5/2010,yeah because there isn't enough lag in eve already. just think of the server having to load custom paint jobs and logos for every individual ship.

6/5/2010,"i love frigs personally. i'd rather fly a frig that anything else. however they do ultimately lack staying power. any set up can be countered by cruiser class ships while still maintaining an effective combat capability verses other ship types. frigs can only really be made more effective by nerfing tracking on medium+ guns i think, which would have a domino effect on the entire combat arena. i think frigs are destined to remain high risk role players, which is probably how they were designed anyhow. so while i would love to have more survivability in my frigs, i don't think it's in the cards. one thing i can think of though would be to include sig radius when a frig is sitting still or approaching straight on. i have read that insta popping frigs with larger guns works so well because sig radius is not accounted for when a gun fires on a frig in these situations. that sound right?frig pilots are the fearless warriors, gallantly charging headlong towards a likely oblivion in service of their fellow soldiers. it's kinda neat that way really!"

6/6/2010,"tyrannis is an expansion that no one truly wanted. pve players, pvp players, miners, industrialists, traders. not one of them gave a dam about pi. i feel these expansions are achieving less and less the more ccp does it. heck i bet they spent more effort on perfecting the trailer and adverts rather than the game and features themselves. if visuals and effects of the game were as amazing as those cg effects as seem on the trailers i would be happy. if ccp continues to put more focus on marketing rather than the game, their reputation will fall and their marketing will eventually be taken as a grain of sand. some may not like this example but look at modern warfare 2, activision and infinity put so much hype into it but when people played the game, they felt dissatisfied and now they don't give a damn about the next call of duty game that's being made, especially after the main developers pretty much became crippled."

6/6/2010,got my support for this.but i do kind of see were ccp is going with this. right now there are alot of new things to be added to game like dust415 interaction and station walking. i bet once all that there and all the releases that are needed to expand and start new layers of game depth are in place we will not be seeing shinnys for spell and they will hammer out this things.
6/6/2010,i support this idea.truth is that elegant powerful design get's more and more complicated when you always want to add something new.therefore it can be a far more elegant solution to redesign and enhance existing concepts. especially broken stuff like the faction war are easy targets where nobody will cry and shout if you change fundamental things.just go out there ccp and make an excellent game. if you do not know how to tackle this stuff without damaging your preexisting gamedesign go out their and get in contact with all the other companies that collected some wisdom in game design and improving a preexisting system on a long term scale without braking the eggs. read mark rosewater's brilliant weekly blog about game design on mtg.com for instance. it's even free!
6/6/2010,good thread. the concept certainly has my support
6/6/2010,"yes! quality outweighs quantity.i have been playing since 2003 and the development team does look like a kid on adhd that can't keep focus on old content and features. please start fixing the end game before adding new content. eve is already a very complex game with a steep learning curve for new players. there are plenty of old neglected content that has the potential to provide a broad range of experiences for years to come. broken or neglected features and promises all drive consumers away. one big 'free expansion' a year that add new content should be sufficient. give more time for testing new content and many smaller patches that improve old content.let dust 514 and eve online stay as seperate games until the neglected features in eve has been fixed. eve has no immediate need for pi and dust 514 has no immediate need for ingame interaction with eve. it's a great idea but premature. what would be more prudent is to improve eve gate and out-of-game interaction between the players of eve online and dust 514, using this as a stepping stone to future ingame interactions."

6/6/2010,"today i logged on to see a ""news article"" about how 15,000+ people cannot be ""wrong"" since they were watching at8 on streaming vid.ccp, i ask you:50ish pages * 30 posts per page = 1500 people have posted so far, the vast majority supporting the op.are we wrong?fix eve."
6/6/2010,i fully support this- great thread
6/6/2010,"i wholeheartedly agree. as a loyal, and steadfast player with four accounts i believe i have a right to expect loyalty from ccp in return. finishing what is unfinished, fixing what is broken, and polishing what has become dull would make eve more interesting and, as a result, i believe, help ccp's bottom line more than new shinys twice a year. i like the idea of a 9 month expansion cycle or, even, one new expansion and one ""completion"" expansion a year."
6/6/2010,"could not agree more.my feeling is that eve has only been ""ok"" up to now. adding new content is fine, but if the foundation is shaky you're ultimately just creating more problems. most of the critical acclaim eve has garnered is due to the game's uniqueness, not its overall quality. the minute some big game publisher figures this out, their going to produce a superior space mmo and steal away most of the userbase. the carebears will go first, followed by the solo mission runners and casual pvpers. only the hard core lowsec people will remain, and even many of them may be lured away if the competition is compelling enough. ccp will have nobody but itself to blame - the sheer amount of web marketing and hype this game gets is unbelievable, considering the relatively tiny amount of customers eve has. from what i've heard most of the trial players come and go within days, disgusted and perplexed by the half-baked ui which hinders rather than helps. their looking for this style of gameplay but are used to a much more polished experience. the resulting feedback spreads through the interwebz where other developers and publishers pick up on it. the (highly dubious) awards ccp receives only draw more attention from the big boys, who are already looking for the next ""big thing"" to supplement the threadbare mmorpg experience. ccp needs to give top priority to bug fixing, overhauling the ui, restoring faction balance, improving the non-pirate experience and allowing for greater customization of player properties (ships, structures, etc.). if they don't get serious this year, then i strongly suspect the clock will start ticking. as the mmo audience matures, the demand for a more accessible eve-like experience will grow exponentially. somebody is going to meet that demand."
6/6/2010,"totally support. i've felt this way since i started playing.i was (and still am) astounded at the number and frequency of glitches and shotty work i see in eve.some issues have simply gotten worse!for example, catalyst hulls? before they were just fragments of the hull on my screen, now they are a blur of overenlargened pixels that stretch the system i'm in, looks something similar to the gate flash except taking up over half my screen. and it only happens in select systems.anyways, that's just one. ccp needs to slow down, backtrack, and fix the old before it compounds with new problems.+1 indeed."
6/6/2010,"+1and to ccp, if you ignore this much support over something, it makes us wonder if anything we do will effect your decisions in this game, just look at the pages and pages and pages of support for this proposal, and many of us have just never brought it "

6/6/2010,supported
6/6/2010,i dont support this.so far i have not seen one good resion to remove them. and only bad ideals on how to go about it.this has zero to do with new players. there is a point as a new player were you have to come to grips with the fact your never going to be on the same sp level as all the older players. that is what turns new players away not the learning skills themself they just make them face that fact sooner reather then later.secondly is i dont want eve to be like all the other mmo's man. i dont want to race to a cap level. i hated that alot. i like that fact there is no cap level and that they keep adding more skills all the time so you always have something to work on in the skills part of eve.lastly you truely dont need massive sp to compet in one single thing. you just need to train the right sp pool for what you plan to be doing. and pick something that you will like doing for a spell as it will take time to train the right sp pool to go and do something alse.edit: eve is not a instant gradifaction game its a game were you have to take time to evolve your toon. dont jack with the balance or the force will bite us all in the rear.
6/6/2010,"i know with my first character i reached the 1.6m mark without much in the way of learning skills trained... seeing all the learning skills baloon to many days each convinced me to reroll... if i hadn't been enjoying eve, this post wouldn't exist...i am sometimes tempted to start another alt and train her 'properly' with all learning skills to 4 or 5, but then i consider the training time to do so and realize that i should just stick to my main and just drop in another learning skill whenever i don't know what to train... i know now that if i had stuck to that first character, i would have spent my second month training learning skills and might be that much closer to all the things i want to do in eve... and i probably wouldn't be split up amongst so many things... ah well, something to think about when i someday get another account, she can resume her training then..."
6/6/2010,"yet again i will underline the fact that we dont discuss here about should they be removed...because its something ccp is working on.but about what will happen, and whats the best solution for theirs removal."

6/6/2010,"supported, i can't see why any insurance company would do such a thing."
6/6/2010,"it is more about action and consequence, exactly the opposite of wow.edit : oh and supported :p"
6/6/2010,"i disagree to this idea. you pay for the ship, you receive money back. simple as that. i already wrote a page long post on a similar pro carebear post like this, but tell me, from rp perspective, how can you deny insurance payout on a ship that get insured in lowsec, thus, the insurance company operating in lowsec, away from concord oversight?secondly, say if you try to move your ship 1 - 2 jumps through highsec with below -5 status, & you get killed by concord (can happen, if you're too slow), you would void insurance too??so no, i do not support this proposal. better solution is to fit some tank or gtfo when you see a local spike, or use a directional scanner.-1 for this idea."

6/6/2010,i will not give a ok for this but with alittle more twiking i would go with plex from the 20mil mark to the 50mil mark. as for why i picked out this part of your quote from de'veldrin's post is what your saying makes you look stupied.as we all know time is relavent.

6/6/2010,"only player pirates use lowsec agents, and stop others from using them by ganking anyone who comes to ""their"" lowsec hub. they made the choice to be on the wrong side of the law so the law shouldn't employ them. this would also reduce the effect of the mission nerfs because there would be less total lp so the value of lp items would increase. if player pirates want to run missions then they can clean up their act and do it in highsec."

6/6/2010,"bombs are a fun thing in 0.0 but sb tend to be pretty limited in lowsec and even more in hi sec, i have recently looked at the mechanics of bombs and feel they should be allowed to be launched in all space however concord if they can shoot the ship will also shoot and destroy the bomb meaning people wont really be allowed to randomly grief.how would this help people?pvpers will be allowed to use this for heavy engagements, sb are nice for smaller corps / alliances so these will work fine when at war.due to the loss of t2 ships a person will have to decide if the sacrifice is worth itwhat about griefers?as stated concord will shoot the bomb(s) and player if they see it launched, we need to give permission to players to allow bombs in hi sec not just restrict.where would bombs be used?a player would have to be away from concorde in order to use this correctly meaning it will be best suited for pos warfarewhat about low sec?low sec guns will shoot bombs but will not always destroy it, so camping will still be possible although gate guns will fry your sbwhat about missions?bombs will be allowed on npc rats, however to prevent abuse, bombs will instantly cause rats to change targets and depending on how many rats are there will most likely succeed in destroying the bomb(s) and sb (assuming it failed at warping.however any damage dealt to a neut structure / person will ofc cause you to get aggro from concord (like if you hit an accel gate)what about carebears?bombs will encourage the use of transports with defence mods, assuming this isnt at gates / concord camped areas (stations etc) there should be no real way to get away with launching bombs at gates / stations because of concord but that doesnt mean we should allow people to use themthis wont harm players at all even an inty without mwd can evade a bomb"
6/6/2010,"i'm not one to cry ""troll"", but seriously?devs have stated that they aren't going to do bombs outside of 0.0 because of what calculating aggro/gccs would involve.this is definitely in the category of ""sounds good on paper until you realize it would mostly hurt the people who think it's a good idea."""

6/6/2010,"drakes only get a bonus to kinetic damage. this means, out of their four ammo types (for t1 ammo) only one-quarter get a per-level ship-based bonus. on the other hand, all other races' ships (with the exception of a few missile boats like the missile frigates and the eris) get bonuses for all their weapons.so, i propose changing the kinetic volley bonus to a volley bonus for all missile types, or a rate of fire bonus. this would make running those odd non-gurista missions a bit more enjoyable."
6/6/2010,drakes already do perfectly fine and some would argue it's the best battlecruiser t1 in the game and u wanna buff it? do u even fly drake?
6/6/2010,"yeah sorry, but no. i fly the drake myself and the thing is a beast at tanking. i'm thinking the lowered dps is there to balance out its tanking ability so it doesn't become a roaming deathboat murdering people without them being able to do anything about it. basically its already pretty well balanced from what i can tell, and like the poster above me said its arguably the best t1 battlecruiser as it is."

6/6/2010,drakes are already one of the most used ships in game even though it doesn't have that bonus so it doesn't need it
6/6/2010,drake is overpowered. very good tank + good unmissable dps

6/6/2010,"lowsec missioners in alliances that control mission hubs (not the ones who venture into .4) get almost twice as much lp per mission as highsec runners, and operate at virtually the same risk since their alliance controls their mission hub. it's unfair to us newer players who can't form a corporation powerful enough to take over a lowsec hub for ccp to increase the gap between newbies and old players even further by giving lowsec missioners higher rewards."

6/6/2010,"as it is now, the odds in highsec are stacked against pve corps. mission runners don't have the knowledge to be able to defend themselves (even though they usually have skillpoints invested in pvp).they are, however, good at running missions. let them run some special, wardec only missions for concord to invalidate the dec. perhaps there will be no bounties or rewards for these missions, but it would let pve'ers play their playstyle; playing one's own playstyle is the point of the eve sandbox after all."
6/6/2010,"playing ones playstyle is fine, but that means accepting all the consequenses and limitations that comes with it. the freedom and interaction a sandbox requires also means, that some interaction will happen whether you like it or not. i suggest you learn to better manage those aspects you perceive as negative like everyone else.not supported."
6/6/2010,"it's not that bad really but....there'd be only one such agent, he's in space, in a dead end low sec system (that's connected to high sec)the mission will always send you to the neighboring system. in this mission, you have to kill up to 2010 lootless salvageless sleepers. warping out of the mission reset the spawn timer (but remaining rats stay). all of these sleepers target paint you to obivilion, ensure that you show up on probe scans.the mission shall have 5 ships in initial wave and increase by 5 for every subsequent wave. for every character warped into the mission starting from 2nd character, 5 more is added on top of it.whenever someone warp into the mission, the warring corp is notified."
6/6/2010,"i can't see myself supporting this. usually people have a good reason for declaring war on you, and one of those is that you are defenseless carebears who could learn to pvp is you ever took the time out of your mission running to do so. nothing is stopping you from dropping corp, station spinning, or, you know, fighting back. like the first replier stated, you accept the limitations of your playstyle and therefore the consequences by choosing to not pvp. if anything like this were added it should only be able to be run once every 3-6 months. being able to constantly get out of decs would make it not worth deccing at all and i just can't see ccp doing something like this."

6/6/2010,still mad about that badger?
6/6/2010,"there's been a lot of discussion lately, particularly in the small/medium gang warfare about people avoiding fights unless they have a guaranteed win. there will always be people who want an easy win, but i believe that there are ways we can encourage people to just go out and have a good time, even if they can expect to die in the process.the purpose of this thread is to get some ideas going about ways we can make pvp more attractive- even to the smaller of two blobs. many people are of the opinion that people shouldn't need incentives to pvp- but frankly, it's become an obvious problem particularly in low-sec, where roaming gangs often go hours without seeing fights.here's a few ideas- please give me your critique, and offer your thoughts:disclaimer: these are ideas- not proposals. i agree- some of them suck and/or need development. keep comments productive, please.issue 1 - looting: often in pvp, even the winners of an engagement come out at a loss, because they spend money on ammunition, t2 drones, and expensive overheating, as well as repair bills, and are unable to loot the fight for various reasons. when fights are lootable, only about 50% of modules drop, including ammo and charges- meaning that relatively very little of value is recovered.possible solution 1: increasing the amount of loot dropped may help incentivize pvp, since it means that killing ships becomes more valuable. possible solution 2: creating some form of looting rights system, so that the people involved in destroying a ship get a guaranteed chance to loot first, rather than being first come first serve. this is particularly important in large, ongoing fleet fights that attract 3rd party ninja looters and salvagers, and also in high security space where casual passersby see people fighting, and are able to loot wrecks faster than those involved in the fight who are focused on fighting.issue 2 - the cost of engaging in a losing battle:the biggest deterrent from pvp is the cost of losing an engagement. people don't want to put their isk on the line, since it means potentially spending time recouping from a loss. this leads to fewer and fewer people wanting to fight just to fight- and makes it harder and harder to just go out and have fun. i completely agree that pvp should never be lossless- that said, i think some things could be done to make it a little easier to lose a battle.possible solution 1: insurance rebalancingtyrannis brought some welcome changes to insurance, but i think more could be done along these lines. if i spend 10,000,000 isk to buy and platinum insure a vexor, t1 cruiser (not including fittings), i think the insurance payout should be in the neighborhood of 8-9m isk, meaning it retains 80-90% of its value when lost, not including modules. for all t1 ships, a payout rate along those lines would be ideal (some of them are already up there). when you go to t2 ships, that rate should drop significantly, but not as significantly as it does now. for t2 ships, i think you should be reimbursed about 50-60% of the cost of ship + insurance without fittings. for t3, again that number should drop- maybe 30% or so? these numbers are approximate- so i'd like your input.possible solution 2: loot retention/reimbursement/insurance? this may conflict, or compliment the aforementioned looting ideas- but being able to recover some of your fitted modules when you get destroyed may help encourage more pvp.---i know there's a huge desire to stomp your opponent and make him cry like a little baby- but the fact is, i'd rather fight 50 people and have 1 cry at his loss irl than fight 5 people and have all of them get upset. anyhow- i welcome your ideas and critiques. as stated above, i am fully aware that some of these ideas aren't great- but i think we can all agree that more pvp is never a bad thing."
6/6/2010,"deleted, i didn't read the op enough when i originally posted this. sorry tortugan."
6/6/2010,"not a proposal- as stated multiple times in the op ;)any constructive feedback then? do you agree or disagree that more incentives to pvp would be a good thing? if you disagree, why? if you agree, but believe that this proposal doesn't offer any realistic solutions, what are your ideas?"
6/6/2010,"it wouldn't work, for reasons already stated. the real aversion to pvp is that when outnumbered, anyone who's not a complete idiot would try to make a run for it. it might help if there's something to even the playing field for pvppppp to make it worthwhile. like an artificial % buff for the minority side, and % gimp for the majority."
6/6/2010,"thats a pretty giagantic problem you've decided to tackle there. one thing i can say is that controlling looting is not the right answer for this game. incentives to pvp should come from things outside of the on grid sphere of implementations. like controlling sov. etc. i think there need to be an expansion of that same idea into low-sec somehow, not obviously the same but things that benefit those who can hold their power or even those who roam about and win fights but don't necessarily want to stick to one area. there were some suggestions for improving low-sec in a thread somewhere here. perhaps if rico could bump his thread again ;).the major problem i see with issue 2 is perhaps more about the difficulty of escaping a loosing battle once you get in it. but that is perhaps more a fitting/training issue. another contributing factor to this is co-ordinated fire has such devastating effect and its not that hard to accomplish. i don't see any particular way to deal with these problems without actually ruining a bit of the game. i'd rather just see things left the way they are and deal with it.it is extremely brutal and it really takes some getting used to for a lot of people, but that's what it is and that's what makes it worth it really."

6/6/2010,"you forgot one vital thing, you forgot to compare hp/sec. msb will instantly repair the damage. the mar will have to wait a good amount of cycle time for the damage to be repaired. dead space shield boosters have the capability of maintaining an excellent boost tank and a good sustained tank with management. dead space armor is stuck to doing sustained tanking.why don't you try comparing to gistum a-type msb. armor gets more utility and shield gets more damage. those factors balance each other out.dead space shield get both a cap and rep boost.dead space armor does not. large armor rep is harder to fit on the relative tanking ships compared to large shield booster.a large armor rep should be about equal in qualities to a x-large shield booster due to its high fitting requirements. if not lower pg requirements. armor may have higher buffer than shields, but shields can regenerate! the more shield hp you add, the shield hitpoint recharge rate increases! so not only do you have a bigger buffer, but you get a better passive tank!"

6/6/2010,"eve is a supposed to be sandbox where you can do whatever you want within the rules of the game. but suicide ganking forces players out of their play style, which is contrary to the sandbox concept.though suicide ganking will still occur if ccp subract's the victim's hull value from the ganker's account, it will be used much more as a tool to profit from traders and much less as a griefing mechanic."
6/6/2010,"how exactly does suicide ganking force people to out of their playstyle? i can see how this might be, if you consider afk flying a paper thin beercan loaded with huge amounts of loot a playstyle. to me that seems more like idiocy and less of a playstyle, since there are well known precautions players can take to avoid suicide ganking. i also don't really see the level suiciding being a problem anymore, but if you insist on limiting it even more, removing insurance would be a much better and simple measure to achieve what you want.not to mention the sandbox concept allows players to do as much as possible without any forced paths or spoonfed content or restrictions and keeping the limits on their actions minimal. if you want a game where you choose all the interaction you want to subject yourself into, you want a themepark game. interaction and influence between players is one of the most important aspects of this game, so it would be foolish to say, that that kind of interaction is contrary to the sandbox.not supported."
6/6/2010,"bolded the important part. if i want to nuke your hulk i am going to find a way to do it. depending on how much you cry after i do it, i'll wait for you to come back in another and do it again. charging me for the cost of a destroyer hull probably isn't going to stop me which is what i'm assuming you want. griefing is part of the game, deal with it or don't undock juicy targets."
6/6/2010,"i do not see how suicide ganking breaks any ""rules"" of the game. the official rules are listed in the eula or terms of agreement, and suicide ganking is not mentioned there.if you refer to the currect concord mechanic, that concord will punish (or attempt to) anybody attacking without them being hostile, then also, i do not see how any rules are broken, or how the mechanic is flawed. the person attacking you will lose his ship, which is a sufficient penalty on its own, in my opinion. if you want to charge the person attacking you with an additional fine on top of their shiploss, i do not see the logic of it.from rp perspective, the person attacking you will most likely be an outlaw, or a person commiting a criminal act, and there will be no way that that same person will be a good citizen and pay concord the bill for what they blow up.lets give an analogy:lets say you are irl being robbed by a criminal on gunpoint. he takes your wallet, with 200 eur/usd in it. now because he committed a criminal act, robbing you, all of a sudden that criminal gets a bill send to his address saying that he must pay 70 eur/usd tax/fine to the government, because he committed the act of robbing you.now do you think he is gonna be the good guy and pay that amount? no way in hell! he will live outside of the law!now back to new eden, and back into rp perspective:you need to keep in mind that the outlaw/criminal lives out of reach of concord (in lowsec). it is one of the primary reasons of becoming an outlaw, so you can live without societies restraint. if such an outlaw goes to highsec on a suicide trip to kill a hauler full of goodies, his ship will get blown up, but concord cannot send him a fine to his address in lowsec where the criminal is living, simply because concord oversight of lowsec is limited to nonexistent.now the outlaw has lost his ship, and you can say: ""oh, lets capture his pod, so he can pay the fine"". now that would be the only way that the op's idea can be rationally and rp wise put to use, but keep in mind the outlaw will choose death above imprisonment or paying, simply to wake up in his own clone in lowsec.so this is my attempt to give a rational and rp wise explanation on how the op's idea cannot be implemented.not supported.ps. keep in mind, there is always a choice. in eve. that is the essence of the butterfly effect/sandbox. by forcing people to pay hull value, you take away choice. and now that, is against the rules of eve."

6/6/2010,i do like the idea of having fw involve more pvp - especially small gang stuff. however the problem with rewarding kills too much is a potential exploit.people may just get an alt in the opposing faction and kill them in an insured t1 ship over and over again. this is why any such per kill proposals will have to be very limitted.

6/6/2010,"among other problems, eve style pvp is unsustainable. all the carebears who produce anything will move to pve server, and the old server will die as pvpers kill themselves off to extinction.meanwhile pve server would be flooded with all kinds of materials as there is only faucet and not enough drain.what you wanted already exist, in theory: highsec. although it doesn't actually work. stuff like wardec compromised this supposed safety. not sure why ccp would come up with highsec at all, then intentionally sabotage it by adding in wardecs. they are certainly losing a lot of noobie subscription over it, the griever subscription can't make up the numbers they drive away by a long shot. but oh well, their problem."
6/6/2010,1) go back to wow2) join pve server3) ????4) profit!
6/6/2010,"there are a number of issues with your proposal in my opinion.for starters, one of eve's strengths is the single server setup. it allows the game to be far more dynamic than other mmo's, nearly all of which are forced into having static worlds, because the multiple servers would be pulling the overarching story in too many directions for it to be coherent anymore. it also fosters a far more involved community, as individual/corp reputations, star system sovereignty changes, weird occurrences, etc. carry far more weight and are ingrained into the fabric of the community as a whole in ways that are not possible in wow or ddo. splitting the player base by adding a second live server would ruin the storytelling ability.secondly, as mentioned before, a pve server will tend to attract the part of the eve community that actually makes the pvp possible. the pve aspect of eve, the miners, the manufacturers, the salvagers, hackers, pure 'carebears' (much as i hate the term) who in their own ways provide the replacements to all those frigates and battleships the pvp community loses in alliance warfare and kamikaze runs in highsec. and the pvp is what creates a market for all those pve services. if and when all the pve players go to the pve server, you're putting a hardline separation between supply and demand, leading to the original server that is starved for ships and equipment and the new server that has all the items and no one to sell them to.forgive my hyperbole, but i think that such a move would actually kill eve online. i can't support a proposal that could do that so blatantly."
6/6/2010,"this game is not pvp nor pve, so having alternate servers would destroy this concept. the basis of eve is the delicate, knife's edge balance between pvp (creating demand), and pve (creating supply). the supply and demand economics are so well balanced that every change has to be carefully analyzed before being implemented.at first, i wanted a split server as well. while that may work for games like world of grindcraft, it will not work for eve. this game is player-centric, whereas other games are more story or combat-centered.not supported."
6/6/2010,"this person is obviously a troll. he has nine posts total, all of which are making proposals that no sane eve player would seriously consider. everyone would do well to just ignore him."
6/6/2010,"spice missions up a little bit. a faction spawn here, a strange rat there, maybe a special npc pirate who tries to disrupt your mission. this would keep eve interesting for those of us who have already ran every mission a dozen times.plus, faction rats would keep nullsec isk-making in check by lowering the value of faction modules."
6/6/2010,"spicing up mission is fine and there are already leads of great ideas on these forums how to do this. randomising the missions to some degree is one of the proposals. you can go add your ideas to them.there is already a chance of getting faction drops from certain missions and i don't really see any reason to increase them. each activity, area and profession has different set of items, that gives value to that area/profession/activity. if you start to give valuable items in a easy to grind missions on a regular basis, it loses that value very fast. if you really want to get those rare items on your own without buying them, the option is there to go do those same activities others do to get those rare drops."
6/6/2010,"nullsec corporations are flooding the market with isk gotten from high-value plexes and high-value beltrats. however, since it takes good pvp skills to hold nullsec space, nullsec empires often have poor logistics because not many people in them can mine. this wasn't a big problem before the tyrannis loot drop nerf, but now they have no minerals with which to make ships.if ccp removed the bounties from nullsec rats then mission runners wouldn't get shafted (for once) because there would be less inflation, but nullsec corps wouldn't get shafted either since they could actually have ships to fight each other with."
6/6/2010,"this proposal doesn't take into account, that these nullsec sources need to provide an income for each individual and nullsec empires have the best logistics. the current system allows most kinds of players to make a good living there, the mineral composition was changed to provide better for their mineral needs and they can always compress minerals and jump them to nullsec from other areas. inflation can't be a reason to do this, since it doesn't seem to actually exist. not to mention, if you want to reduce the amount of isk produced high level missions are just as bad as killing nullsec rats if not worse. you seem to be trying to solve a problem, that doesn't exist.not supported."
6/6/2010,"if ccp decides to retain lowsec agents (maybe they can prevent players below -5.0 from using them), then it needs to make them useful to people who aren't in corporations that control lowsec mission hubs. no automatic concordokken, but it would make lowsec more appealing to mission runners since we would have a chance to survive when a player pirate attacks us in our dungeon.basically, these navies would have a jam strength proportional to the system's truesec, and would only come after a minute or so of fighting (in .4) or almost two or three minutes (in .1). the navies would not do any damage. player pirates would still be able to kill targets (especially if they use teamwork to overwhelm a target) but mission running would actually be possible in lowsec without joining a dominant player corporation that controls a lowsec hub."
6/6/2010,the game for you.
6/6/2010,"i'm against adding more of these forced npc mechanics, that limit players and eve. if this is what you wan, you can always stay in highsec, since allowing people to keep playing their own style seems to be important to you. the solution to this issue, is to develop mechanics, that allow players to make the systems they control more secure. they could also develop mechanics, that make anti-pirating work better. basicly these npc mechanics should be kept to a minimum, so adding more should be avoided.not supported."

6/7/2010,"1. oh right because low sec pirates would never ever attack a pve player right? 2. oh ok--""consequence"", which is more severe than risk because it's a 100% chance u lose your ship. amazing how idiots like u use ""risk"" simply because the ""consequence"" is really worse than risk. and what's wrong with ""worthless"" gear? here in eve, gear =/= winning, moron. seriously, go back to wow if u wanna keep your welfare epics.1) well, low-sec is low-sec and i think low-sec is fine for the most part. i don't have a problem with it and i don't go through there unless i'm prepared. that should be true for anybody.2) i already have my own gear. but it would be pointless to take out a pirate because his stuff is worthless. what would i get out of attacking a pirate? nothing, it would be a net loss 95+% of the time. pirates target ships where they think they can get more out of it than they lose, assuming that they aren't just bored. and what the heck does wow have to do with anything? you seem to know a lot more about it than i do.1) correct me if i am wrong about kill rights. i have 30 days to track down and kill the pirate who destroyed my ship. but i have honestly never seen anyone who attacked me again in that time-frame that i recognized so kill rights are relatively worthless in my eyes.2) right, outlaw = red. i thought that was clear in my original post that i understood that, thus the reason for wanting to shift the limits for when pirates become outlaws. yeah, well, that is the way it was. i preferred it, but there weren't enough anti-pirate players to actually be effective. i think the idea is that concord would bring a giant task force if a pirate blob were to form (infinite tank for example). especially if they lose a ship to a blob. i am not looking to nerf concord into uselessness, i just don't like the current system, i think it's really lacking. i was more looking at giving the pirates a chance to evade certain death. at least then they might fit a ship worth losing a ship for if nothing else. then you would have a risk:reward ratio.my suggestion actually does buff pirating in high-sec so i am surprised that my suggestion is viewed as screwing over pirates. i really thought the station huggers would have been the ones to object but instead i'm called a station hugger."
6/7/2010,"1. u said that suicide gankers should be punished even more simply because they target pve players. what difference does it make whether it's done in high sec or low sec?2. what's wrong with pirates picking targets if it's no different than u not picking certain targets? why is it only okay for u? 3. some ppl here want high sec to be 100% safe so they can operate in complete safety, just like in wow.1. what u were describing in a previous post was the aggression timer. and don't tell me u were blindly flying around with absolutely no clue where the pirate was... 2. which once again goes to: 1. u already wanted concord to be destroyable, now u don't. can u even make a proposal that actually works or r u just gonna keep twisting it to your convenience?2. as long as concord is anything less than omnipotent, it will turn into low sec because when players r given the opportunity to kill in high sec with impunity, they have 1 of 2 options: a. babysit your whiny ass or b. kill u for your whiny tears. take a wild guess what they're gonna do... under this new system, not even newbies would be safe as they would under the current system.in conclusion, your fail proposal fails so miserably that after i pointed out that it would indeed buff pirating too much, u're trying to rename it to a fail pro-pirate proposal to save face. way to go...way to fail...again. but plz continue 'cause u've just made my day...again!"
6/7/2010,"1) i don't think anyone should be punished. pirating is a profession in eve, even high-sec pirating qualifies as such.2) i don't have a problem with pirates picking targets. pirates since their inception have preyed on merchant ships while running from anti-pirate warships. the differentiation is that they have a risk:reward ratio to work out whereas an anti-pirate has zero reason to proactively stop a pirate. they get all of the security penalties, ship loss, etc. with a negative payoff.3) i think i was asking for high-sec to be more risky for both pirates and station huggers. the whole high-sec/low-sec .5/.4 cutoff is just too abrupt for both parties.1) apologies if i wasn't more clear. i think the aggression timer should be longer, yes. i think i did mention that. but if you are a good pirate and can elude long enough to get to low-sec... unfortunately, concord doesn't allow anyone to stay alive to make the outlaw tag upon the inception of violence meaningful either. 1) i think that there is a big difference between making concord instapop anyone and making them a high-sec rat. if a bunch of pirates start to blob, then yeah, there are no players that are likely to try engaging them. so, as soon as concord loses a ship, then absolutely making concord invincible would be a valid game mechanic. i haven't twisted anything. you brought up a scenario and i elaborated. i still don't think that concord should be able to instapop any ship they don't like. but if you destroy one of their ships, then you and your gang better be heading for the exit.2) you are sadly quite right i'm afraid. i'm not sure what the outcome of my idea would be, but it could make things worse for sure. which only sucks, because it completely eliminates 'legitimate' pirating outside of low-sec which is seriously uninteresting and creates the current suicide ganker activities which are really quite stupid. no real-life pirate would consider this a positive nor workable strategy."
6/7/2010,this thread is now officially open for comments and discussion. you are all now welcome to post your thoughts.
6/7/2010,"comments:- this seems pretty easy to abuse, because you can have 50 people in stilettos hit 50 systems simultaneously... if someone comes you do what you can to hold them down. amarr are most susceptible to this since they have the most systems.- i somehow doubt this will limit blobbing because you're essentially telling 250 people where you are!- but... the npcs really do **** everything up, and i really dislike the whole ""shoot it and rep it"" cycle that happens in 0.0well, i support the removal of those npcs... so carry on.-liang"
6/7/2010,"very well expressed proposal, and i think it's a sentiment that the vast majority of subscribers share.while new shiny features capture some game press and perhaps cause a few new subs and resubs temporarily, the game already offers a vast range of different experiences that potentially appeal to a wide audience. have pride in what you have already made, and refine and polish it until it truly shines."

6/7/2010,+1any chance ccp will comment on this?
6/7/2010,i have to 100% agree to this. in my honest opionion it would also help ccp. eve is a great game but i think it would attract more players if more of the features would just reach the excellence ccp is preaching.
6/7/2010,"while i agree with this, i imagine what this game will become with all the future development.because this game is a world, and something is still missing in it from a theoretical point of view, so it actually needs new features.but from the perspective of a player, i cannot disagreee with the op. imho, ccp should assign permanently a scrum team for every one of these areas: improving all ui (combat ui, corp management ui, pos management) fix the damn lag and once you did it don't mess with it again (at least call for a mass testing before, if you did this for dominion release you would have warned before doing such a bad move). game design on factional warfare game design of 0.0 sov warfare (about treaties, and a mechanic that encourages smaller engagements avoiding lag) game design on improving lowsec, and generally balancing the revenue of 0.0/lowsec/highsec. game design on general rebalancement of ships and weapons there should be some sticked threads in the feature and ideas discussion like the one abathur did, discussing all these aspect, where ccp devs discuss with us.it's clear that rebalancing lowsec/empire will make someone unhappy: we had a lot of mission runners whine, and any change to 0.0 warfare will make some 0.0 guy cry. but that must happen. and a better ui and lagless game are due. so thumbs up"
6/7/2010,hell yeh!
6/7/2010,"anybody who wants anything good for eve online must support this proposal.i have a nagging feeling, that it is a very specific person or group of people who at ""fault"" for this unhealthy development, and that they properly have been caught up in routine and fancy slogans and are having a hard time to sit back and reflect.i also have a feeling that incarna is a momentous task to pull off, and with all the promises and future possibilities it will provide, it needs to be delivered pretty soon. but when that task is done, it is my hope that all 2011 ""expansions"" will be about adding to and fixing old stuff."

6/7/2010,could we get the ability to scan anchored cans as well ? even if they were the hardest things to scan and require more skills.i would love to go looking for peoples anchored can depots in wormhole space. setup ambushes or blow up the cans and take whats inside.edit: wanted to add my thumbs up and support for this proposal.
6/7/2010,"while i would like the salvaging profession expanded in multiple ways, including with the ability to scan down wrecks, i would rather support a ""dual wreck timer"" approach.one timer (min 1 hour max 2) where wrecks would be unprobeable until it had deteriorated enough for probes to find it, and a second timer until the wreck would disappear completely, lost in the void of space (like the current timer do)."
6/7/2010,no go for this.. i don't want my escalations in 0.0 to be scanned by some hostiles passing by and you can not choose the place of escalation.. maybe only abandoned wrecks (blue) should be scan-able? hmm..

6/7/2010,you don't read patch messages do you? there was a whole blog about why they did this. they did this to nerf your income and to lower the amount of minerals being gained from missions. just like theyve been doing for years.
6/7/2010,hi-sec mission runners are mostly isk farmers anyway and they dont risk anything.

6/7/2010,"seems utterly reasonable to me. i cannot think of any reason that these actions should give so much as a sec hit, let alone concord aggro."
6/7/2010,"crap, fair point, you're right. i hadn't thought about clustering on multi-agent hubs being an issue - i was thinking about clusters on q18 agents in 0.5 or similar. i'd also assumed n was a fairly generous number for the typical player, but of course it's min/maxers and macro'ers who'd plump for multi-agent systems.as an aside but using the same logic: are we also in favour of mining belts becoming dynamic, and ratting too?"

6/7/2010,"so, 25 battleships try to gank my providence (freighter). i order my first escort to let off his, then i order my second escort to let off his ecm burst exactly four seconds later (every fraction of a second counts during suicide ganks).the result: my freighter was saved, as the escorts were not in a fleet with me. concord arrived and destroyed all of the battleships, my alt had my freighter webbed, so i was able to warp out from the drones not too soon after.the problem: my escorts were also killed by concord for using ecm bursts. i couldn't give a rat's ass if the pirates lost 25 insured battleships for nothing, i don't know who they are, i'll probably never see them again either. my problem is my corp members dying to defend me from a suicide gank. since this game tries to mimic reality in many ways (economical, political, etc), it would make sense that concord would understand the need to use ecm bursts when your under attack by a suicide blob.proposal: allow a defending player/fleet use ecm bursts near gates and stations, without being attacked by concord."
6/7/2010,"it will be hard for you to define ""defending"" in a fight. because your ecm bursting ships are effectively attacking aswell.but i have to ask you this ... you have *3* ships with you. (2 ecm bursting ships and your alt with the web) and you jumped through a gate with mostlikely 20+ battleships sitting on the other side before sending in a scout to check the other side?a smart move would have been to dock up/safespot with the freighter and wait for the gate to clear, after your scout reported a bs gang sitting on the other side.so ... not supported. if ecm burst will be allowed in highsec without concord interference we will see a lot of griefing with it."
6/7/2010,"please attach a detailed algorithm which determines in which circumstances a ship counts as a defending ship. then, prepare to get criticized on the impracticality of your algorithm as it will undoubtedly open the door for a multitude of exploits."
6/7/2010,when your aggression timer goes up after being attacked? this would only apply at gates and stations as well.
6/7/2010,"it's because your burst also hits other random people at the gate, the gate itself and possibly the billboard too. you can't configure an ecm burst to hit only 'aggressive' people, you have regular jammers for that."
6/7/2010,"sure, its actually pretty easy: if any person in range has a lock (or is attempting to get one) but does not have a gcc, then you get a gcc. not that i support the op... but what you asked for is pretty easy.-liang"
6/7/2010,"you know what i'm going to say? who cares, it's not like its really affecting the random people around you (remember this only applies to gates and stations), it can't even damage anyone, unlike smartbombs. regular jammers aren't going to stop a 20-30 battleship gang.again, i'm going to emphasize for the third time, this would only to apply to areas around gates and stations. an ecm burst won't bother anyone not involved in the combat near gates and stations. it doesn't knock you out of warp or prevent you from warping.and to darius: do you really think ""organized"" suicide gankers sit at a gate with 25 people for a scout to see them? do you have any idea how the suicide gankers work?"
6/7/2010,"ecm burst isnt just targetting everyone with an agression flag. it is area of affect. you hit everyone and everything in the radius of the ecm burst. so you deserve to get punished by concord.yes most of the time they sit on the gate when you jump through. they dont just warp in right after you jumped. because then you would be gone with a webbed freighter. so if you alt/corp mate jumps through, he should see 20-30 bs on the gate and shout ""dont jump"".you warp your freighter back to a station/planet/safespot and wait. when you need the ecm burst you already failed at hauling and have to use the last resort safety guard.i fly regularly through uedama/sivala, niarja/madirmilire or the deltole pipe. so trust me i know how freighter suicide ganks work."
6/7/2010,"as long as the ecm bursting character only hits corpmates and people with a gcc, then he won't get concorded. you just need to be more careful about who is in your aoe."
6/7/2010,"and that is almost impossible to do when you want to break lock from all battleships, which are sitting right at the gate to be in range where ever the freighter appears. so you will hit the gate atleast and get gcc for that."
6/7/2010,"the issue here is that ecm is a defensive measure. it causes no damage and has no effect other than to break the lock one ship has on another, so someone please explain to me how that counts as aggression. unless you are targeting someone you have no way of knowing that you were even hit with an ecm burst (besides the graphic effects).i think it's perfectly reasonable to allow the use of defensive measures to protect assets. isn't there a favorite saying of all those who fancy themselves to be real hard-asses something like ""concord is there to punish, not protect""? if that's the case, then players should be allowed to take the protection part of the equasion into their own hands and use ecm. in the us military we have our rules of engagement, but no matter what the rules are for a given situation, one line remains the same always: ""the right to self defense will never be denied."" to me, punishing people for using ecm is tantamount to being told that if you walk down a dark street and get jumped by 10 armed men you have to sit there and take it because using pepper spray to blind them (see what i did there) is a crime because it could harm someone else or get it all over the sidewalk and buildings.i already know someone is going to come back with ""you can use directed ecm already"". yeah, great, that allows you to break the lock on 1 ship in a 10+ fleet and you have to deal with lock time. the gankers also have the option of using eccm to counter, so don't ***** about it being unfair. i will support this with the stipulation that the cycle timers on ecm bursts be increased from 30 seconds to 90 seconds or more."
6/7/2010,"-1, ecm bursts already suck enough outside of some extremely limited use cases. hell, i'd be +1 to letting you fit as many ecm bursts as you wanted again. i already answered how to make the aggression problem go away.. you only get aggression if you have "
6/7/2010,"sounds reasonable, but people will use it to grief mission runners and stuff / on alts in highsec wars. it might be more reasonable if it didn't provoke concord/sentry gun response but on the other hand did flag the person using the ecm burst to whatever targets they hit and if you couldn't be ecm bursted by 5 ships continously."
6/7/2010,"i think the solution is not being about to attack or get gcc from gates/billboards. they are the usual culprits. if you set off ecm busts with a bunch of people around, tough luck. you should get gcc for using an aoe on random innocents."
6/7/2010,"supported, assuming it can be implemented to nearby gates only. there is no reason for passersby to lock anything at a gate, so it wouldn't affect them and there is no new possibility for grieving opening up. the only side effect would be on wardec highsec gatecamps. but who cares about them."
6/7/2010,"if the proposal is ""aoe weapons versus gates and other npc structures don't cause a concord response"" then yes. ecm affects the outcome of combat so should always be considered an offensive act when used against players."
6/7/2010,"well that's the whole point, really. if you're randomly hitting neutral people with negative effects in highsec, you're going to get concorded. if you want to avoid that fate, don't attack random people."
6/7/2010,"yeah, that is sensible."
6/7/2010,fixed
6/7/2010,supporting my own topic
6/7/2010,walking in stations is the most useless idea ever...just use alts in other corps or leave and drop an alliance there are many ways to get around wardecs...
6/7/2010,"will two pilots with exactly same skill points (in same areas and same skills) fight the same? combat / pvp base on sp?if not, why not allow players to skill up faster?this game should be more than just sp, i was told that this game is meant for multiplay that is why skill training q only allows up to 24 hours planning."
6/7/2010,"instead of replying in character, could you try replying in english?quoting nothing, then talking nonsense, and lots of it, does not help.simply learning skills do not determine the final sp gain rate, they merely contribute to it. if ccp want to take them away, it's no problem because they have more software that will determine the final sp gain rate, and it will be exactly what it is today. there, that was easy wasn't. if only you actually knew what you were on about compared with what you typed, this would have been so much more fun.because if it isn't, it's veteran cry time. and we know this, because if anybody suggests changing the sp gain rate, they're crying. like why you are here now.to pretend that the secret cabal of millionaires is about to destroy eve.do we know who they are? do they have a guest spot on cable tv? rampant millionaires club or something?are they famous? these millionaires who are just waiting to end eve with infinity sp? are they movie stars? oil barons? drug dealers?who are they? who are these multi billionaire shadow warriors just waiting to end our favourite land of make believe? come on, out with it.so come on sp increase haters, who are these millionaires waiting to end eve, and why aren't they buying every character on the bazaar?"
6/7/2010,"i don't do pi but i doubt you need such an accessible button for it, it should be removed from the selected item menu or at least moved away from the warp to button.people spam the warp to button to save pods, they don't need it next to a button that forces a loading screen."
6/7/2010,"this was brought up alot on the sisi forums.... needless to say they apparently like it there >.>edit: i don't think it needs to be removed though, just move it over where it belongs beside the eyeball button."
6/7/2010,moving it more to the right would probably be a good idea.did you try to report this as a bug? might give a faster turnaround.
6/7/2010,.
6/7/2010,"while we are at it can we move the ""show info"" one or two down from the ""start conversation"" while you are at it!"
6/7/2010,"an option to turn off that background chanting in amarr stations. i'm not sure if it happens in other faction stations but and option to turn it off would be great. it doesn't go away if you turn music all the way down (in audio settings). it only goes away if you turn off all audio, which makes you miss out on the other awesome in-space sounds.some may like it, which is why i'm proposing an option, rather than eliminating it entirely.thanks"
6/7/2010,"sounds good on paper and in game, at least allow us to be responsible of our bombs / bubbles rather than preventing it"
6/7/2010,"highsec bombs? you do realize concord won't show up in time to shoot them, unless they're already there, right? i can see this making jita more interesting."
6/7/2010,"actually, it's even worse. until the bomb detonates, the player hasn't committed a crime, so concord won't shoot anything even if they are on site."
6/7/2010,"it'd be nice if they were allowed in low sec, but to what you suggested, no way. devastating high-sec with random bomb launching greifers loosing relatively cheap ships would cause more problems then the t1 insurance caused.i can guarantee you i'd be on that boat in a flash and just launch a bomb at jita cam purely for the giggles. imagine someone or some corp who's actually dedicated to greifing."
6/7/2010,"like i said, if concord see a bomb it gets blown up, so places naturally not camped by concord will have have their bomb hit such as planets, moons, asteroid belts, generic spots in space, complexes etcjita while would be amusing the odds of bombs causing a problem would be slim unless you somehow convince everyone to warp to you at a planetatm bubbles and bombs cant be used in low sec / hi sec but if you try to click you get an odd reason' this is very un eve like tbh, allow it so concord get ****ed if you use bubbles / bombs even if they dont harm anyone"
6/7/2010,as much as my covops 5 self would appreciate this... no. i appreciate the differences between 0.0 and lowsec. :)-liang
6/7/2010,"there are already shortcuts, the default is shift-fx, shift-alt-fx and shift-ctrl-fx for the top/mid/bottom row respectively. still, it would be nice if the indicator was more pronounced and a key+click shortcut added."
6/7/2010,would like to see the entire module state halo changed - green/red active/deactivating no overload. orange/yellow active/deact overloaded.not sure about key+mouse combo - would prefer dual button so pressing left+right button activates module and overheats or overheats if already active. deactivating module or right clicking on module with overheat on will turn it off.
6/7/2010,"hmmm...i like the idea of having a <modifier-key><click> option to toggle overload. right now i tend to right-click and use the menu just because i miss with the mouse too much.some other overload issues that need discussion:* there is no confirmation that you have actually toggled overload until the start of the next cycle. possible solution: the small green overload arc segment could turn yellow to indicate what state the module will be in at the start of the next cycle (ie: green = it will be off, yellow = it will be on).* in the overheat of battle, the difference between small green arc segment (overload off) and small bright green arc segment (overload on) is sometimes easy to miss (esp for those of us with old, tired eyes). possible solution: the pulsing halo around each module button (green = on, red = deactivating) could be expanded to include yellow (""overloaded"")* once you have turned on overload, you are committed to 1 cycle -- you can't turn it off until it actually activates. this is a similar issue to allow reactivation of accidentally deactivated modules (csm)i am sure other people have suggestions and comments -- get them in and if a reasonable consensus can be reached, i'll submit it for consideration at an upcoming csm meeting.best, trebor"
6/7/2010,"definitely supported! i've mistakenly clicked (or failed to click) that sliver of a ""button"" too many times to count."
6/7/2010,i agree with every one of these points.
6/7/2010,definitely signed !! my dream would come true :)
6/7/2010,i'm always for ui improvements.lax
6/7/2010,"nothing more annoying than having something that deserves a ""big red panic button"" be more of a tiny sliver. the skill of using overheat is more in being able to click the button and less knowing when to click it."
6/7/2010,"can we lift the 80 limit on blocked contracts. there are more than 80 scammers in eve. everyone's alt on every account has 5 public scammer contracts up. for some items, scammer contracts outnumber real ones. it's annoying to scroll past all those scammer contracts every time you check for an item."
6/7/2010,block limit is a fail.
6/7/2010,supported.even an option to exclude contracts below a user defined value would be a welcome addition.
6/7/2010,this actually an option already. have fun with it!
6/7/2010,"my corpies and i just got decced and have to stay docked for a week. we pay for eve, so why can't we play a game that we pay money for? it's one thing to pvp in lowsec and nullsec and the occasional suicide gank is fine, but non-mutual wardecs should at least not apply in .8 and higher so that we can actually mine during a dec. we'll make less isk but that's the price we pay."
6/7/2010,no. if you don't want to be picked like lowing hanging fruit don't be low hanging fruit

6/7/2010,"an idea came to me while slacking off at work just now that i think would be extremely successful and making 0.0 return to a bit of gang warfare would be to reduce the respawn rate of rats by a great deal, and to reduce the rate at which roids respawn/reduce the amounts of them.i think this would make it extremely difficult for mega alliances to sustain themselves, and would cause more small gang pvp. if two alliances that are next to each other are having trouble sustaining themselves, i think this would either cause them to shrink in size as an alliance or expand outward, war deccing everyone around them.possibly add more mission contacts in low sec (maybe even in 0.0?) which could in term buff low sec as well.i think there should still be some sort of draw to 0.0, so maybe make it so t2 ships / cap ships etc require special stuff from 0.0? idk.having to keep this short and it probably will not be well thought out as i'm at work. but just an idea that couldn't hurt"
6/7/2010,this doesn't even make sense. how does forcing 0.0 players to have mission alts(which a lot of them do anyways) break up power blocs?
6/7/2010,"i don't think it forces them to have mission blocks, the original idea which i portrayed poorly, and the mission suggestion was just a suggestion i was giving to support my current idea. it wouldn't have to be the way i listed at all, but maybe make the max size of an alliance depend on how much space they own. the more pilots they have, the more space they have to have, or they must stay smaller.idk just rambling i guess"
6/7/2010,"fail cat is fail. if anything, rats and mining is the only reason small gang warfare exists in 0.0. if alliances had to rely on that income more than, say, moon gold... there would be even more mining/ratting and even more reason for small gangs to roam."
6/7/2010,"yes, supported! gimp the russians.while most individual income in sov null come from plexes, 23/7 macro-ratting is big for corps. well, some corps, anyway. something along the lines of drastically decreasing spawn frequency but increase bounty and drop rate would gimp macro-ratters big while benefit legitimate ratters."
6/7/2010,what are you on about? you know there are these things called moons from which material for t2 construction comes...
6/7/2010,do you understand t2 or cap production at all?
6/7/2010,im still a bit of a newbie player - but i think it would be kinda cool if evety once in a while - a random solar system security would fail. concord tied up or something...and for like 12 hours the security would hit like .4 or to 0.0would make things interesting not only for being 'stuck' at a base but also needing to 'haul' stuff from system to system. you would have to watch more the security.any thoughts on this?
6/7/2010,only if it happens in jita.
6/7/2010,yes cause having all you industrial assets locked down in a station or your research poses suddenly free for attack would be so much fun ... get out!
6/7/2010,"interesting in theory but broken. now, if the sec status was to constantly fluctuate within the high/low/null groupings and on a longer cycle, including moon mins, belt rats, navy response, concord response times, etc, that could be an interesting way to keep the landscape fresh. probably more work than ccp would be willing to put in though. it would help make the game more interesting, which seems to be against ccp design philosophy these days."
6/7/2010,i am so tempted to support this
6/7/2010,"i see a few problems with this idea.first, if a high security system falls to lo or null sec, people could jump capitals in and nothing forces them to leave. second, people could technically anchor starbases in a 1.0 system that falls to .3 or below.one bright side i see however, bubble spam a gate (and unless concord destroys them), suicide ganking gets a whole lot easier and tears will flow.not supported however."
6/7/2010,"me too. seriously, good idea from sujanra, but ultimately probably unworkable."
6/7/2010,"you're not helpless. try to fight, hire mercenaries, or go back to wow.however, though this seems like a good idea, especially if cap, bomber, pos, etc. rules don't change when a system's sec is lowered, i can't support it unless dynamic sec status drops were made a core part of the game since it would cause too much disruption."
6/7/2010,"there is merit in the base idea. no, not the lulz part.but, players influencing system security status would be an interesting angle to pursue. not just in high sec, but primarily low sec and even nullsec. that way you'd also be able to avoid ""hiccus"" along the lines of ""omg my stuff is now camped by mackinaws"", since things would evolve along the way."
6/7/2010,"when you try to drop a bomb in high sec, you're informed that concord law prohibits it. if concord can lock modules like that, why can't it lock aggressive modules against non-war targets or non-can flippers?"
6/7/2010,"you know, its just a thought, but you don't actually have to make a new alt every time you want to spam these boards with troll threads. in fact you don't even need to spam these boards. you could go to features and ideas section and learn why everything you say is wrong."
6/7/2010,get out
6/7/2010,this!!!
6/7/2010,"because that would be a terrible game mechanic, that's why."
6/7/2010,go away.not supported.
6/7/2010,"there's ecm bursts. imagine if there were target painting modules. i understand not having tracking disruption burst modules since that could hurt droneboats too much, and sensor dampening bursts are rather pointless because bursts have a short range, but target painters are the least useful ewar and definitely need a buff."
6/7/2010,i forgot to check the support box.-vag
6/7/2010,lol
6/7/2010,"so you want to take the two least useful ew modules, and then mash them together so that you get the worst of both worlds. brilliant. why don't they fire defender missiles at cosmos agents while you're at it?"

6/7/2010,"the watch list is too small, and it's too easy to miss broadcasts. i propose a skill which gives +5 people on the watch list per level for a total of 35 people on the watch list. i don't care what the prereqs are, even if its logistics 5 its fine."
6/7/2010,or instead of adding a pointless skill ccp could just make it so you could have like 50 people on the watchlist.
6/7/2010,[proposal] watch list & broadcastsjust linking the thread for reference. you might want to check if it was brought up at a csm/ccp meeting already.
6/7/2010,"last night i went to go build my first ship. i loaded my mats and bp onto my badger and headed for the nearest station with an assembly plant. having played for less than 2 weeks i didnt know rancer is a bad spot so i went to jump through there.well befor i even finished loading i had about 10 pirates on me, my warp drive disabled and i was crawling. well to put it short by the time i loaded up on the other side i was half dead and nothing could be done, end result lost what iv been working on since starting and pod killed to boot all befor i even could react. i propose that there needs to be an invulnerability timer once you jump, this would allow unarmed ships a chance at survival and discourage huge gank fests at jumpgates.i fully understand the chances i take going into a 0.4 sec area and wholy accept what i have comeing to me if i get caught in the open. but to not have a chance to load up let alone react before having my ship blown up seems like a rather poor design for any game and discourage new players from staying."
6/7/2010,"first off, this is the wrong sub-forum to post this. read carefully in which forum you are about to create a new post.regarding your issue: feature exists, it's called gate cloak. to progress in eve, you need to be able to teach yourself and learn from your mistakes. consider your badger loss a learning experience and move on. try googling ""eve session change mechanics"" or ""eve gate cloak mechanics""."
6/7/2010,welcome to eve
6/7/2010,"if you are reffering to the cloak you have on when you come out the other side of a gate, then obviouslly the mechanic does not work since not only i but anyone that came through there was practiclly dead befor finishing loading. but i am new, so please enlighten me if you are reffering to something else."
6/7/2010,"the cloak works, you moved or something. well you know except when you jump into a node with huge fleets and it takes 30 minutes to load...just keep out of low sec until you learn the game you will be fine..."
6/7/2010,"yeah everyone's talking about the gatecloak, but in a system like rancer it's probably pretty useless. the gatecloak lasts 30 seconds, and rancer grids are busy enough with smartbombs running 23/7 that a session change would easily take longer than that. however, in a badger, you'd have been lucky to get through even if everything ran perfect.i don't think the solution is to add invulnerability timers though. instead:a) better route setting tools - it should be easy for a rookie to tell if their route takes them through lowsec, and the recent stats about those systems. that info is collectable through the map, but the map is awkward and slow, even if you already know what you're doing.b) better navigation tutorials - the tutorials tell rookies to autopilot everywhere they go. by default stargates do not even show up on the rookie overview. once rookies learn how to navigate safely they'll be more likely to be successful in first lowsec travels and have less fear of itc) clearer and better default autopilot settings - does anyone know exactly how these work? the basic ""avoid lowsec"" setting with default security penalty will route you around 0.5's if possible, and try to keep you as high sec as possible. security penalty of 10 will send you through 0.5's but not into lowsec. the way i figured this out? i set a dangerous route and used trial and error. why is the default setting not better, and why is the default autopilot setting not 'avoid lowsec'? why do we have to go into the slow and useless map to access our autopilot settings?tl;dr helping rookies be smarter about lowsec is better than game breaking new rules."
6/7/2010,better idea: change it so that you are only spawned on grid if it has finished loading i think that should be not too hard to do. i don't know if it would increase the server load though.
6/7/2010,"there is no system in the game where going to the nearest factory sends you through rancer, so whatever method you used to pick a destination was bad. also, the 30 second gate cloak timer is what you want. did you have autopilot on or something?"
6/7/2010,"first of all the cloak last for 1 minute not 30 sec, it is longer then the session change timer.i am guessing the game can't tell the difference between lag and disconnects. so if you did this you would be able never appear in a camp if you just shut down your client or pull the cable...also you emergency warp away anyway, at least i always do on exceptionally slow loads. so it would only make a difference for cloakies in camps large enough to lag you out (ie no chance of running back to gate).how about fixing the lag instead so a grid loads in less then a minute?"
6/7/2010,"not true, i've gone through rancer a few times in the past month and haven't seen a soul."
6/7/2010,"drake.. it's a good solid ship that is easy to fly, that is it. if every idiot and his dog flies it because it's easy, does not mean that it's op"
6/7/2010,"one thing that i have been waiting for a good long time, are some kind of logs or security in pos sma, maybe add a log file section that directors of the corp can access or maybe even beter, have similar password security that is on the gsc on ships in he sma,, the corp maybe have to pay more for the added security for the smas, but it is much needed! and shouldnt be too hard to implement"
6/7/2010,"have a rating system where people can rate their market experience with other players, similar to ebay. you can filter out people in local based on this rating. this will not eliminate scamming entirely but it will save other players time by us not having to look as closely at contracts since most of the scams will be filtered out.this will also make loan contracts actually useful, since you could say something like ""he paid back the loan"" or ""he was a good lender, thumbs up."""
6/7/2010,"please stop posting ideas here already. try the features and suggestion forums, see which ideas people like, and then maybe bring them here. you post tons of ideas and every single one of them bad."
6/7/2010,"even if this were implemented, it'd break down instantly. i'd get a bunch of alts to thumbs-up my scammer character, then scam with a positive reputation. you could allow people who haven't traded to set ratings with someone, but then scammers would just rate down genuine traders, solely to poison the rating system. even if this was a good idea - and it's not - it wouldn't work."
6/7/2010,"it could work, if there are some restrictions on ratings. make it so that only those who traded with the toon, with public contracts, above a certain isk value, can rate. contract fees/taxes on those high value trades would act as deterrent for spamming fake ratings through large amount of fake trades.or it could be a public rating from specific watchdog groups. there is already a jita-scammer watch corp. basically ppl with too much time on their hands, how they keep watch on that coma-inducing soup of jita local is anyone's guess."
6/7/2010,whats to stop asshats like you (the op) from making alts/toons and friends from giving you false positives?think before you speak.you'll live longer.... maybe not.
6/7/2010,looks good with goose's modification. not sure how easily it can be implemented. but there is no downside since it can't be easily faked.

6/7/2010,"i think the troll has run enough, a 1-week forum gag would do fine."
6/7/2010,this is outrageous. nobody gagged ankh when she said she wanted to ban highsec wars and she's a csm!
6/7/2010,sweet jeebus yes. it's a pain to have to avoid certain threads just because of the banal crap that a certain op posts.
6/7/2010,"monsieur picard, this is a proposal to the csm, not a request to ccp. as it was the same for ankh's proposals.your disagreement is noted and acknowledged. the outcome will however be determined by the people of eve, good luck to you i guess."
6/7/2010,thanks. us pve'ers should be allowed to have a voice too. just because the pvp crowd disagrees with us doesn't mean we shouldn't be allowed to post.
6/7/2010,considering how he is reacting... i support this.one less idiot to watch post trash.edit: apparently i didn't edit my post fast enough.but my point remains... this is getting out of control.a warning is not enough.
6/7/2010,"one-week ban, yes.lifetime ban, no.get real. that's way too harsh for a day's worth of trolling.edit: i went through and read all his posts, and whoa, but still not bad enough for a permaban."
6/7/2010,"it's not because you're a pveer, it's because your posts are so awful you make space-jeebus cry. you sound like you're on trial account most of the time, you are so clueless as to how things work. anyone can come up with ideas that would completely break the game, and this week, anyone is you. imagine if everyone just spouted every half-baked idea they could think of, the good ideas would be lost in an ocean of mediocrity. have less mediocre ideas and then maybe people wouldn't pour on the hate so much."
6/7/2010,"just start reporting him, i do believe spam is frowned upon in the forum rules. but other then that supported, the dude's a waste of time.maybe the csm should work on modifying the assembly hall rules to limit morons like emo tj here."
6/7/2010,what's outrageous is having to filter through the constant bull**** threads you continue to create.
6/7/2010,"first i thought ""surely assembly hall-folk are overreacting"" then i read a few of his threads /facepalmeither he's a terrible, unamusing troll, or just completely ****ed. not to make a personal attack or anything.srsly guise- ban him, at least a temp ban so he gets the picture.tortugan is not amused."
6/7/2010,if we ban him can we also ban all the people that keep bumping his threads?
6/7/2010,"much as i think he's the most pathetic troll i've ever seen - and if he's not, then he is clueless in a way few people could ever dream of - we don't ban people for being morons. stop feeding him, and hope he goes away. if you want to bring a csm proposal up on this topic, here's one - let us give thumbs up/thumbs down in threads without needing to post. that way we can all collectively point and laugh without needing to bump his garbage."

6/7/2010,"that makes me consider the idea of somehow gaining skill points from pvping- though i suspect lots of people would oppose the idea, since eve is so unique in its skill point system.what would you think of some sort of skill system in addition to the current one- maybe based around individual ships? (example: if i fly vexors constantly, i get a bonus to drone damage based on how much time i've spent flying them?)-- would that be a welcome addition, or cause more trouble than it's worth? not sure i agree with you here- as nice as it would be to escape from every fight, increasing the likelihood of escaping fights means fewer opportunities for others to get kills.a fair point- but i think you're contradicting yourself. you mentioned expanding lowsec as a possible solution in your first paragraph- which is a viable possiblity. it sounds like you're in support of certain changes, but maybe not as fundamental as some of the ones i've suggested?"
6/7/2010,"until very recently, insurance on t1 ships was actually higher than what you advocate. was that sufficient to incentivize enough pvp, in your opinion? and if so, have you actually noticed a significant difference in this short a period of time? imo, the only decent suggestion on how to do this i've heard is to transfer more of a ship's value away from the hull and towards the modules, so that they can drop. it'd be terribly complex to do without screwing everything up, and the transition would be as bad for windfall profits as tyrannis was, but it'd do the trick at least in theory. a simpler version might be to make mission rats salvage for less and pvp wrecks for more - the missioners won't like it, but again, it's wealth that a pirate can get their hands on."
6/7/2010,"other then the contentious learning skills, the skill system is pretty damn good imo, should definitely not award sp's for anything done in game, down that path lies madness.but perhaps adding something along with pi that planets have to pay protectcia money or that there are reduced costumes charges for goods produced there for corps with a presence in the system or around the planet. or perhaps one could stick them up and rob planets in low sec. or a boost to the restricted goods aspect of the game which can be produced in low sec in order to smuggle to empire.yeah pretty much, i'm against changing any of the pvp mechanics to achieving your purpose. really i think its more a low sec problem the it really s a pvp problem. 0.0 has reasons to go out there, empire has reasons to stay there. the only reason to go out to low sec is to hurt people. that's not actually an incentive to pvp, that is pvp."
6/7/2010,there's just no good way to do this. no one is going to stand and fight when there fairly confident there going to get there pods handed to them and there normaly right thats why they run.
6/7/2010,"now if you scale loot with the number of participants so solo kills get you mostly everything, something like 2-5 people is same as now and over 10 people on km practically nothing, you incentivize small scale pvp and b/c of larger fights yielding much less loot, probably more stuff gets destroyed."
6/7/2010,that's a pretty damn good idea as difficult as it may be to implement. risk vs reward and all that.
6/7/2010,"while the insurance rates for t1 ships were high (actually too high imo) pre-tyrannis, the insurance rates for t2 and t3 were (and still are- though slightly better now) terrible. think of it this way- of the 3 tech levels of ship, only the lowest, most primitive one is viable to lose frequently in pvp. if you open the door to more t2 and t3 ships by softening the loss, then instantly the average player is able to field more competitive ships more frequently. i do think there should always be options for people with tons of excess isk (faction ships, officer gear, t2 rigs, etc)-- but i think that the vast majority of pvp ship, t2 included, should be cheap enough to lose occasionally without spending hours grinding for isk.interesting idea to transfer value to loot- though that would still only benefit the winners of a given engagement. it might be a viable option alongside some other changes.i also like the salvaging idea- but that's bordering into another discussion (imo the salvaging ""profession"" needs some love- make entry-level salvaging less profitable and add skills to make expert salvaging more profitable)"
6/7/2010,"yes and no. i'm not saying this is a perfect solution (nor do i fully back it)- but one example of an incentive to stay and fight even if you knew you were going to lose could be a pvp experience based ship bonus system- the more you fly a ship, the better you get with it. in that case, along with insurance being cheaper, it would be worth it to stay and fight- maybe get a kill or two, die, and have a few more skillpoints for it.that said that system probably isn't viable, especially since ccp seems perfectly happy with the current sp system. what that idea is, though, is an example of an incentive to stay and die fighting. i'm sure there's a viable incentive out there."
6/7/2010,"not a bad idea- i remember seeing that idea in another thread a while back.i do, however, wonder whether people would start exploiting it by roaming around in larger gangs, but delegating small squads of people to certain targets? it would give them a disadvantage to not focus fire, sure- but not a very significant one."
6/7/2010,"in a real world, the only reason to stand up to a larger force is as a last stand. 5 guys will never beat 300, and they are best off either harassing the edges, or providing movement intel to other friendlies, as in rl. i think people fly in large fleets because it makes them feel like they are part of something bigger, not because they are particularly fun. small gang is much more fun to actually do (5-30 pilots) but they aren't provided the opportunities to do much more than hunt down other small gangs.i think what you really want is a mission for small gangs to have an affect on the landscape where a defending force, like a way for small gangs to disrupt sov and things like that. there are posts running about that kind of stuff."
6/7/2010,they dont have to put npc min buy orders in to have a floor they could have just left the insurence be. i think there is no dout that ccp wants the players to end up with full control of the markets and resoures all to are selfs to ruin or build as we see fit.i dont like that ideal anymore then most goverments. its going to screw alot of people over at some point with out regulations.micro mining is the real world= of slave labor. theres just no way for an honest man that pays his employs a far wage can compete with that shi z.

6/8/2010,"nice ideas. there would need to be fewer plexes necessary, i think, but make them take longer. i agree that spamming plexes in small ships could be annoying (noobship alts anyone? easy to kill, but not in 50 places at once). thus make each plex take say an hour, but only have on average 0-2 per system. (scale necessary victory points accordingly.)"
6/8/2010,"plexing in fw is pvp not pve. this is a common miss-conception with those who assume ""plex"" = ""pve"".good thing we have plex restrictions to manage the engagement size and allow for fights even when one side is vastly outnumbered. then why not use the plex size restrictions to get an engagement of a size you can handle? npcs allow you to fight those blobs you're complaining about. they are the solution to the ""problem"" you see.the npc ewar does require a rebalance.no it wouldn't.by removing npcs and messing with plex size restrictions you remove the very mechanic that allows you to fight blobs when the enemy is stronger for your timezone.this has needed fixing for a long time.plexing is already a pvp activity and fleets that plex are already fit for pvp.it won't. it will however remove all the mechanics smaller fleets have for managing them.by removing the ability to use npcs as a force multiplier?smart.....already the case. already the case. so your suggestion is that the larger militia should have complete dominance and the smaller militia should have no tools for engagement size management.amazingly short-sighted.not supported."
6/8/2010,"not in the usual sense - unless there's an opposing pilot involved. at most it might amount to poor market pvp for lp or standings gains or something.what the hell are you talking about? the npcs are the biggest deterrent to small scale pvp i've ever seen. i'd rather camp gates for pvp than do plexes because plex npcs make it impossible to pvp. freaking brain dead i swear.the only intelligent thing you said. even still, the plex npcs are a catastrophically stupid way to handle things... and if one side is that outnumbered, it might make sense that they lose.......-liang"
6/8/2010,"you must be talking about solo plexing in backwater systems.with fleet plexing the whole point is to choose plex for the pvp.when the enemy outnumber you, small/medium plex can be used to force the enemy to ship down.also unrestricted plex can be used to engage larger fleets including capitals with the help of some npc dps.impossible to pvp? i can show you hundreds of fights where the plex have been the sole reason for a fight being at all possible.when the enemy is flying around in a 30-40 strong bc/bs fleet it's the plex that allow your 10-20 strong cruiser fleet to engage.if you think plex somehow block the possibility of pvp then you really don't know how they work.plex are a tool for the underdog to gain initiative and force the larger side to react.they are a very important part of fw pvp which expand the fight beyond gates and stations."
6/8/2010,"yes, because that's the order of the ****ing day man. if people want blobs, they go to 0.0. if they want small gang ****, they goto low sec. fw is in low sec. q e ****ing d. fantastic, in my corp alone there's been thousands of potential fights that were avoided because we couldn't pvp inside fw plexes and missions. i've seen two fw fleet this strong. two. ever. ****ing ever. come on now, way to use the once in a decade arguments.no, you're just out of touch with reality - the fleets simply do not form up the way you're suggesting. it doesn't happen, stop using it as an argument.no.... they aren't. they're an impediment to pvp because it takes a dual logistics blob to go after a ****ing rifter in a plex. -lianged: and yes, i'm currently in the faction war and i've been in it before. and when my pirate coalition gets to rolling, we blast through amamake/auga and outnumber both militias."
6/8/2010,"size restrictions on plexes is probably the only good thing about the whole fiasco called fw. yes it means you have to have more stuff ready to fly but it beats the hell out of any alternatives.npc damage is beyond pitiful, look at the mails, even frigs out damage them on most mails. the only issue with them is the ewar - that is what makes them troublesome for plex fighting .aka. ""the blob magnetizer!"". would create insurmountable spam (mail or channel), would not serve to rally any more people than are already willing/able and benefits numbers (in pilots and systems) significantly more than current.there will be no change what so ever. tons of frigs capturing every plex in sight, run to next when enemy shows .. will have zero impact on amount of pvp. will be particularly grievous when there is a large number disparity between two sides as defensive squads can only cover so much ground.1) how does this differ from the way things are today? blobs means no fights, the large fleet slug-outs rarely if ever happen at/in/near/in relation to plexes.2) how does this differ from the way things are today? blob on call camping goddess knows what with frigates plexing ..3) how does this differ from the way things are today? blobs (in fw) are not necessarily bs. the most frequent composition is frigate/cruiser with a smattering of bs for damage .. the heavy blobs only form when plexing is ""done"" and is a recreational tool .. they have no impact on plexing what so ever.you even mention the obvious course of action as a ""possibility"" .. well guess what, it will be the de facto standard operating procedure for everyone.blob on acceleration gates with single frig taking plex .. or even better, have the blob roam around an area while frigs plexes in constellation and call blob in to whatever system the defenders arrive in .. impossible to counter as the one plex you may save is just one out of a dozen = you lose over time.yea. strategy, tactics and conviction has no place in war at all. read up on the history of warfare and you'll see what i mean .. hell you only need to look at the us fight for independence to get the gist of it. fw is tolerable because numbers does not equal iwin like it does in blob-land.there is no solution to fw unless you are willing to revamp the entire thing .. the basic mechanic is what is broken.not supported. the turd called fw cannot ever get the required shine regardless of how much polish is applied .. revamp is only option.ps: the link to my thread from last year, now locked due to age. still my baby though."
6/8/2010,"thank you all for your posts. i recognize this is a pretty big change and needs to be considered carefully. but i have thought this through quite a bit so before you write it off consider what i raise in light of your objections. just to be clear, i would not mess with the plex size restrictions. this proposal does 2 things and 2 things only. 1) remove npcs and 2) inform player militias of who is taking plexes where through a seperate channel. the plexes would still have the same sizes. (i suppose i added 3.. that plexes spawn throughout the day but i think this change has already been promoted by csm) i am not denying that some pvp takes place during plexing. i dont participate in it because it is done during down time, but i hear it is great fun. but the vast majority of pvp takes place outside of the plexing context. what percent of fw pvp kills would you say take place in an occupancy plex? i would guess 2%. the plex restrictions make them an awesome system to prevent getting blobbed. they are a *great* place to pvp. yet they are almost never used for pvp. why? 2 reasons you have to hassle with npcs (or have the enemy hassle with them  and they will often just say thanks but no thanks if i want to pve i will run a mission) and 2 if you clear out the npcs who says anyone is even going to come in your plex?? you just sit there waiting. i really think with my proposal you would see at least 50% of fw pvp occurring in plexes. and it would be the same great small gang pvp you guys who are lucky enough to play during down time see. liang im not sure i understand what you are saying you would do with 50 stillettoes. if a stiletto is an a plex he needs to stay a certain distance from the button. so you could just chase it off. i mean im not saying certain tactics wouldnt develop im sure they would. but im not sure i understand what you are suggesting. as far as the timer. im not sure it would have to increase that much  if at all. i think fleets would tend to spread out. you would have medium plex fleet(s) large plex fleet(s) and minor plex fleet(s) roaming around. when they see a similar sized enemy gang has jumped into a plex the make the few jumps and fight. there would be constant pvp activity throughout the fw systems."
6/8/2010,"well either npcs are blob equalizers, like dr. battlesmith is saying , or they are next to nothing. but you both cant be right. i think they are one thing  dampeners on pvp.i (like the vast majority of pvpers) tend not to engage fights with npcs shooting at me. i don't know what all the funny ship names mean and i have no intention on learning them. i do not think i am alone on this. let me explain: if i see 2 ruptures a thorax and 2 rifters in a major i have an idea what i'm up against. if i have those same ships with an ass-ton of wacky named npcs, i don't know what to expect. how much damage will those npcs start doing if i get scrammed and webbed? who knows and who cares? not allot of people are going to want to try to figure that out. instead they will just do their pvp outside of the plexes. like the vast majority of fw pvp is currently done. thats just it though. fw has these great plexes with ship size restrictions which could yield so much more! but those mechanics are getting all fed up by npcs and games of hide and go seek.let me ask, what percent of plexes taken do you think involve pvp? when i started fw i took a few plexes but found it to be mainly a pve activity. has this drastically changed despite no changes to the mechanics? it doesnt seem to have changed. now i will occasionally fly to a plex if there is an enemy in local. almost always when i fly in the enemy warps. do i blame him? no he often has about 50% shields from npcs. why would he want to pvp with that handicap?i think that if this proposal was implemented even if the plex wasnt contested we would still get pvp in them. people would see these plexes as a great way to limit blobs and get a variety of pvp. would the side that can field more ships win? yeah i suppose they would. but its hard to say they shouldnt win. moreover if we are getting great fights who cares. occupancy doesnt mean much of anything other than a medal. if that medal was based on pvp instead of pve it might actually have decent value. but even if one side loses because they are outnumbered just keep fighting the fight until the tide changes and they get the upper hand. at least with amarr and minmatar the numbers tend to go up and down quite a bit."
6/8/2010,"if we did away with npcs we would make plexing and occupancy pvp but not without strategy. i think the strategy in fw pvp would be some of the richest in eve. nor would it lead to blobs. it would split them. instead of everyone hanging out in a blob (as they do now because almost no pvp takes place in plexes anyway) gangs would split up and spread out with different sized ships. if you are really organized you can have different sized ready fit ships thoughout fw space. if you are really good you can have jump clones ready. if a big blob comes you can do minor or medium plexes. blobs tend to be unwieldy and take a *long* time to get reshipped or move. if they move too fast they may tend to be reckless and get caught. having multiple gangs able to get in different sized ships fast would be what occupancy would be all about. that is what real war is all about. having the right troops present *when you need them*. not having a big lumbering blob that can't even enter the plex/battlefield.its unlikely that a militia will be able to field 3 different blobs at once, each of which would need to be bigger than any single gang the opposing militia can field. there would have to be one for minors one for mediums and one for majors. and even if they can,(very very unlikely) you just do plexes away from the enemy blobs that apply to your style of plex. intel would be important as would logistics and strategy. but for once we would likely have fcs splitting gangs to try to accomplish different strategic goals instead of everyone trying to stay together and blob all at once.will blobs still exist? sure they will. but if you are in a plex that doesnt allow bigger ships in they will not matter as much."
6/8/2010,"1) removing npcs from plexes makes offensive plexing as boring as defensive plexing - when nobody shows up for a fight. it also makes offensive plexing easy and will lead to massive numbers of afk plexing alts contesting systems.2) broadcasting where plexes are opening is a great idea and will help with defensive plexing efforts, with more chances for a fight.but here's what's going to happen. plex opening up will be broadcast to all. the first three days everybody will rush to defend the plex and the afk plexing alt will simply warp out and move on. the people looking for fights will soon get bored of going ten jumps for nothing (and then having to sit on timer for 20 minutes to decontest the plex). we'll be back to three dedicated plexers on each side hunting each other's afk plexing alts down.bottom line: if both parties want fights then fights will happen. otherwise it won't. fights does not equal occupancy. orbiting a button for ""n"" minutes equal occupancy. sometimes you have to kill npcs, sometimes you have to bail because the other side wants to win more than they want a fight, and sometimes you bring too many people because your goal is occupancy and not fight, and sometimes you get a good fight because both sides bring an appropriate force to the plex."
6/8/2010,"x gallentiuswhile i agree that if both parties dont want a fight you likely wont get one. but often im looking for a fight and im sure there are plenty of enemies out there looking for a fight to but i cant find them or we are in the wrong fits. we can make it a lot easier to get good fights. these changes to plexing are essentially a way to make it easier to find a fight. i'm not sure you would have to go 10 jumps. you would see the plexes popping up throughout the fw area. the only questions are, are you in the right sized ship/gang to head over a few jumps to fight what they have? if not how fast can you get in the right ships? you could of course just continue to roam around like you do now if you want pvp. but i think we would find most fights dont happen that way with this way of finding good fights fast.even if the changes were made, i would likely not do the plexes for occupancy at all. i would do them *just* for the fights. i would probably orbit the button for the heck of it while i am in there. but currently, i really don't care about occupancy. i may if some interesting strategies started to spin off of how it was acquired and they involved pvp. lots of times many on both sides want fights but have very little idea what they need to bring. so one blob for each side forms. (that way yoru ready for anythign right?) blob a sees blob b has the advantage so blob a ships up. half hour later blob a is out and blob b has disbanded so blob a ganks a few things while it waits for blob b. blob b reforms and by they time they are out half of blob a left. etc. the proposed system would be much more fluid. you would see gangs entering plexes all the time thorough out the faction war area. (and hopefully throughout the day and not just after downtime!) you know they will likely be there for the time it takes the plex to run. so you can decide if you want to go fight them. sure some people will run. but if you bring a somewhat comparable gang (and you will know the size of the gang in the plex so why not?) you will get a ton of good small gang/solo fights fast. for myself, i know that if i didnt have to mess wth npcs and i knew someone actually knew i was sitting there, i would show up solo in my frigate/cruiser/bc/battleship (whatever) 70 k off the warp in gate so that even if they try to bring a blob i have a shot at taking out the bait or getting away before i get blobbed. i do not think it would end up with people semi-afking these. think about it. if you want a fight now what do you do? you warp around looking for targets. here you might as well do a plex and let the enemy come to you. if they are coming for you then you know they want a fight. it just helps likeminded people find good fights. it does so without being staged or prearranged."
6/8/2010,"you need to read and understand what i actually said, no where did i say they were ""next to nothing"". i said the damage can be shrugged off but the ewar is what breaks them .. remove all npc ewar and be done with it.pirates have no qualms about taking what little damage the npcs give, be it in plexes or on gates. the only ""wtf..grrrr"" i have ever heard from them is that they were webbed, neuted, painted, jammed, dampened etc. (ie. the ewar) by the rats so they bailed/died/didn't loot .. very rarely do i hear damage from rats mentioned as reason for a missed opportunity.if you assault a plex that you have not previously been in there is no spawns of consequence, if you are running a timer without clearing rats when an enemy comes in then the fault is your own .. stop speed tanking the bloody things and npc's become a trifle.a lesson you are free to pass on to the 50%-shields-runner example you gave .. a couple of guys in proper ships (yes even pvp fitted) can wipe out all spawns almost as fast as they arrive.you cannot possibly be that naive. look at amarr space, a bc-down blob could linger in dal/amamake and reach any amarr fw system within 5-6 minutes. the whole splitting the blob up will never happen unless you give them reason .. allowing any non-noob ship to plex with not even npc interference does not.as i said, the bs blobs rarely shows itself except on weekends when they slug it out for fun, the everyday blob has more than enough ships to go into any plex they want and still outnumber a plexing contingent.your attempt at polishing the inherently flawed system does nothing but benefit numbers and encourage even more plexing-alt lameness (something we have thankfully not seen en masse on a/m front).- the way the plexes work needs to be looked at if any sort of headway is to be achieved.- we also need to look at possible effects of acquiring occupancy to make people want to plex.- then ""land in play"" needs to be drastically reduced to discourage the bumblebee plexer from being able to run from plex to plex evading any attempts to kill it.but it is a moot discussion as ccp is never going to take it up again except to remove the bugs they themselves introduce when they mess about with the code elsewhere (fw is a mash-up of bits and pieces from all over the damn place!) - my faith in them wanting fw to be all it can be is long gone."
6/8/2010,"nice suggestions, but if you're not interested in occupancy, then why tie occupancy war into the proposal?fyi, certain plexes already operate in this manner. the npcs are activated (in some cases) when you start the timer, not when you enter the plex. otherwise they stay inactive. and, all you need to do is open up one of these plexes (or missions) in a heavy pvp system like tama, oms, or heyd and you'll get all the pvp action you want."
6/8/2010,"you need a couple of guys in proper fits just to kill the rats? why not just do away with the rats so you can bring unqualified pvp fits. not a little bit suboptimal for pvp but proper for plexing fits. frowning at everyone who speed tanks the npcs in plexes, even though that is an effective way to plex under the current system, is no real solution. the basic problem i presented is still the same. either the rats have no effect or they have an effect. the only effects rats have is that they tend deter pvp. you suggest we mitigate this by taking their stronger effects such as ewar so that they can be shrugged off. so its just a little bit annoying. but of course reduce ewar and you have more speed tanking. why not just be done with the stupid npcs and be done with it?people who do plexes generally want to have some sort of active tank ability. this doesnt do well with pvp. if you dont have some sort of pve active tank you are likely to get caught with some of your tank missing. this stuff is why no one wants to bother with these plexes. (well that and no one may even know you are there)"
6/8/2010,"you cannot possibly be that naive. look at amarr space, a bc-down blob could linger in dal/amamake and reach any amarr fw system within 5-6 minutes. the whole splitting the blob up will never happen unless you give them reason .. allowing any non-noob ship to plex with not even npc interference does not. ok thats a good example. consider what would happen if we take a large bc-down gang in amamake lets say they are faction a. the other side (faction b) is well aware of this large gang. (after all its in that crossroads system) so faction b actually uses some strategy in their attacks. the fc of faction b makes sure everyone enters the plexes at roughly the same time. so fc of the blob in faction a sees that there is a minor plex open with 3 frigates in asghed, then there is a medium that pops open with 2 cruisers in aset, a major with 2 battleships in taff and a medium with 2 cruiser in sahtogas. (here is a map for those who may not be familiar with the area"
6/8/2010,"im glad your warming to the suggestions. you ask a fair question. it doesnt really need to tie in to occupancy  other than i think winning faction war should have something to do with pvp instead of just pve. i fully understand others will disagree and will like fw occupancy to remain pve centered. even if the system was not contested (so it doesnt really effect occupancy) i would still probably jump in the plexes to get good fights without constantly getting blobbed. usually by the time of night i play all the plexes in the busy systems auga amamake dal are closed. i do often try to jump from place to place to get a level 1 or 2 mission in a busy system. but there are just too many backwater systems so its rare that i get one. even if i do the other side (or the pirates) doesnt really know what the size restriction on the mission is before hand. so even in auga (an enemy hub) i will just sit there unless i post in local asking for a fight. im sure most dont even bother to check mission or plexes with the assumption that if i see them come i will just warp off. that is the way the current system works. i dont mind asking for a fight in local but i would really prefer the spontaneity of not knowing who will show up etc. if you like to pvp in smaller gangs just think about how this would work. it may be that there should be overall more plexes spawning though out the day. i tend to think many people who gave up on fw might come back if there were a decent pvp system, like this. i just doubt many read fw threads anymore. if you like the idea, spread the word, and support the thread. if you dont feel free to post the issue you have."

6/8/2010,"suppored however...ccp are the controllers of this..they have been defining the boundaries, and they will continue to define the excellence boundry also, which is probably a false positive, meaning what they class as as excellence really falls quite short of the real excellence mark.to be honest after all these years i dont trust a single word ccp says anymore...the are more interested in bringing in crap unfinished features just to grab a quick buck...sad but true, and the more ppl eve brings in the less likely ccp will listen, because for every 1 person that leaves 5 probably join, so they think hey who cares, we dont need those players anyway..."
6/8/2010,agreed wholeheartedly. eve is already deep enough and has such an overly robust feature set that i feel like i could play for years and still have only scratched the surface. i can understand the sense of urgency to get incarna prepped in time to release with or before dust but ultimately it only makes sense to have the rest of the game as polished and ready to go as our fancy new bodies. seems like it would go a long way towards subscriber retention and eventually attracting some future dustheads that don't realize they have an internet spaceship addiction yet.svb
6/8/2010,so much needed to pay attention to details. finish products and make eve a polished high quality product.i fully support this topic!+1

6/8/2010,does this proposal have any csm support yet?e: shoulda read the first page i guess. hope something good comes from this.

6/8/2010,"hybrid weapons have been broken for long time now. people still use them, because they don't have a choice, but they are seriously underperforming, compared to projectiles and lasers. both other turret types got completely overhauled in the last couple of years and now it's time for the hybrids. what's the problem?rails:use a lot of cap, have very low alpha strike and dps, not very good tracking. blasters:blasters were designed in the good old times when battleships were going 1200m/s and you could actually get in range. a lot of things changed since then. they completely lack the range to be effective in any kind of small, medium or large fleets. they have same tracking as autocannons, best dps and alpha for sure, but use a lot of cap and ammo.what needs to be done?- adjusting the damage modifier and rof to the following effect:large railguns get +10% dps and 2x alpha strike.medium rails get +10% dps and 1,5x alpha.- large blasters need their optimal increased by 100%.medium blasters need their optimal increased by 150%.idea of the changes?- the idea is to put rails between beams great dps and artillerys insane alpha strike. a balanced weapon platform, that can still compete with the other two in most tasks. - the idea is to make blasters usable in small gangs and fleets, not just camping station undock points or shooting capitals in point blank range. also it will put blasters between autocannons(bad optimal, huge falloff) and lasers(huge optimal, mediocre falloff).deimos and ferox been **** for years now, they need some changes too.- swaping deimos 10% falloff bonus for 5% optimal wll get it to exactly the same optimal as muninn and zealot using rails. also it will work pretty good with the changed med blasters, some people might actually fly blaster deimos again. the slot changes been proposed few times by now and its about time it comes through. one less high, one more mid and powergrid adjustment will put it inline with other gallente ships, compared to their amarr counterparts(one less low, one more mid), atleast +100 pg.- ferox needs another turret slot and possibly some more powergrid. with the blaster changes it might actually become an interesting blaster platform.below are some numbers, for the people, that are actually interested in theorycrafting."

6/8/2010,"and about blasters.first of all my idea is targeted at boosting rails and not nerfing anything. i just want more options, it's obvious we'll still fly zealots and apocs and abaddons and shoot poses in geddons(and bhaalgorns, booosh). what i'm aiming for is:- artillery - uses no cap and have headshot alpha strike.- rails - use cap, have more dps and medium alpha strike.- lasers - use lots of cap, have even more dps and worst alpha.lasers still don't need ammo and reload in like 1 sec, have epic tracking and epic dps, there must be a downside, but it shouldn't come from nerfing.comparing brutix/ferox to harbi/hurri might seem wrong, but this is due to the fact that myrm/drake doesn't fit in any kind of turret based fleet. checking on killboards, you'll see that harbi/hurri/brutix are the most common battlecruiser choices, with drake working mostly with other drakes.another point is that comparing brutix/ferox to cyclone/prophecy is comparing them to ships that are obsolete, basicly saying ""noone uses proph/cyclone, brutix/ferox should be the same"".as for cap usage, lasers are still high on top:mega/rails: -3.3 cap/sec per 425mm ii, -3.1 per 350mm, (-4.3/-4.1 for 3x mag stabs)abaddon/beams(just for comparison): -7.9 cap/sec per tachyon ii, -7.5 per mega beam iiapoc/beams: -5.2 for tach, -4.9 for mega beam this, ofc is neglected by the fact that apoc has the idiotic 9375 cap(+27.1 recharge), while mega has 7031(+20.3), abaddon 7969(+21.3) and hyperion 9000(+20).as for blasters/pulses:mega pulse ii uses -2.6 cap on apoc, neutron blaster cannon ii uses -2.4 cap on megathron. lasers use a bit more cap on armageddon due to rof bonus, instead of dmg per level.there is another thing, some crystals have cap usage reduction(standard is -45%). tracking on mega is 0.07442(with the 37.5% ship bonus), 0.5412 on hyperion, 0.42 on geddon. for a fair comparison, we should be running o+f numbers for pulses/multifreq against blasters/null. as for autocannons, 800mms tracking is 0.054, optimal/falloff numbers are:am l blasters 4.5+13/ null l 11+16emp l acc 3+24/ barrage 6+36multifreq l pulses 15+10/ scorch 45+10blasters got about 20% more dps(25% more alpha) than autocannons, 15% more dps(15% more alpha)than pulse lasers."

6/8/2010,"the idea would be ""buff me, gimp the other guy.""if rails suck so much and laser/projectile pwn, why does every noob and their mother choose to be cadari? gallente isn't rare either, it's easy to see why the last i found myself on the wrong end of a brutix.next thing you know, there will be even more cadari toons, and amar/minmatar would be demanding to have decent missile/droneboats. every race has strength/weaknesses. unless you're proposing a gimp to missile/drones at the same time, buffing rails unbalances races as a whole and we'll have even more cadari toons than there are already.not supported."

6/8/2010,"+1i haven't been much in the highsec lately, but every time i think of it an image of a zoo comes to my mind. this would not eliminate suicide ganking (destroyers anyone?) but it would sure bring some order to highsec. if you still want to gank industrial"
6/8/2010,"i agree, but i think applying risk/reward to suicide ganking should be done in a way other than by changing the way insurance works.the problem is that when it comes to attacking cargo haulers, it's actually harder to do so in low sec, because they can be defended properly with escorts. in high sec the authorities are actually doing more to protect the criminals activity.so my first proposal is that when aggressing a ship that is in a dedicated cargo hauling class, you also aggress whatever ships may be in it's fleet and wing (not too sure how fleets work, but there should be some kind of limit on the number of escort ships allowed). this bonus should only be the case for cargo haulers. you put expensive cargo in something else, can't pay for escorts, or don't bother with them, you're sol. it would also open up the role of escort pilot in the game to include work in hi-sec, and interestingly, the possibility of the gankers bribing the escorts, or even being the escorts (or at least having agents in a cargo escort corp).it wouldn't stop suicide ganking, just make it so that haulers with expensive cargos can take measures to protect them in hi-sec, the same way as they can in low-sec, and make it so the gankers have to make similar preparations to get access to the bigger profits, as the haulers do to protect them.the second proposal, also increasing the time/effort that the gankers have to make to increase profit/reduce risk, is that both cargo scanners and their blueprints should become contraband in hi-sec (with carrying blueprints having a much higher penalty, as their existence in hi-sec means an easier source for scanners there).everyone is free to buy weapons and ship scanners regardless of location, because both can be used defensively as well as offensively. however, cargo scanners have only 2 uses. as part of law enforcement/crime prevention (something players don't have anything to do with, as we can't work for concord), or for use in crime.they'd remain usable as part of hi-sec suicide ganking, but the criminals would be taking a risk in either shipping the blueprints into hi-sec to manufacture them there, or in posessing a now more valuable scanner, that could either be confiscated or get you killed for owning/using it (maybe with each use having a sec status penalty). the penalties could vary depending on which faction's space you are in, so that ganking remains as easy as it is at present in certain areas.haulers get the opportunity to put in time/effort to protect their cargos, dependant on how much they are willing to spend/get organised. gankers get the same kind of opportunity to counter whatever the haulers may do, and still have the ability to do it cheaply, just without it being so easy to make a huge profit from it. both parties have more of a gamble on whether or not the investment is worth it.the whole point isn't to make suicide ganking so it's no longer profitable, just so that it has similar risks/rewards/costs as cargo hauling, because the gameplay is more fun when the challenge lies in outwitting an equal opponent. there is no challenge in being unable to defend yourself, or in attacking a target that can't defend itself."

6/8/2010,"easy way to encourage plexing is do the following-remove the npcs doing so encourages a pvp fight when not worried about the extra dps and ewar the select npcs will do to you.-add notices when a plex is found and/or is being captured throwing a notice in militia chat as simple as ""'said militia' has found a 'complex name' in 'system name'"" and ""'said militia' will capture'complex name' in 'system name' in 'time remaining'"" can rally a opposing militia to gang up and come for a fight, and also notifying in your own militia that friendlies are attempting a capture may garner support from those that just logged on or were clueless that a gang is out or in essense missed the gang-add a benefit to fighting in a plex. great things about the plexes is there is a set ship type that is allowed in to even the fights and make them interesting (yes i know big ships can camp the gate and blobing can still ruin the up coming fights but bare with me.) you already get a small bit of standing for capturing and a very little almost insignificant amount of lp for a fw kill. why not boost the amount lp given for kills for attacking/defending in a plex and/or maybe insignificant standing too?. why not make the award greater for a even fight or fighting against a bigger force and netting some kills. maybe count it as a mission and give the amount a level 1-2 mission (without making it too profitable) depending on the length of the fight, participation, penalty added to blobbing. they are just small things to do to boosting plexing and the fighting to systems that you can think about. it can breathe life into fw too making it more attractive while also not making it the next best isk maker and still keeping it about the fighting and the learning of pvp for the younger generation for their possible move to 0.0"
6/8/2010,"how 'bout they fix low-sec where faction war largely occurs, then work on fixing fw. or fix them both at once. or we could just accept that ankhstupidnamekah's myopic appraisal for the games problems and the solutions is going to remain largely unaffected by other people anyways."
6/8/2010,"ok, there are a whole bunch of ideas in this thread i both agree and disagree with, so i won't pretend to address them all, however i'm going to throw my voice into the pool. just a few ponderings more than anything fully coherent / thought out :)initial post: short term goals are pretty straight forward, i agree with the bugs obviously and also plexes spawning throughout the day, forcing pvp in plexes/missions would be nice (move target spawn closer to warpin? make missions harder to do, it's impossible to catch all but the slowest of people when a frig+sb combo will complete a lvl 4). i can see why some people would be upset about the fw missions (disparity between amarr/gallente missions vs minny/caldari missions is a little off) though doesn't bother me personally. mid term, the recent live events have been a lot of fun (although despite some form of reward being indicated [we assumed faction standing or something] we didn't notice anything, minor quibble there i suppose), i could see fw specific events being fairly successful. no preference on the other two.long term, there needs to be something that motivates people to actually go ahead and fight for space, benefits/consequences would be good though an exact approach is difficult, perhaps a few 'staging systems' cannot change hands, the rest can be contested, any mission agents in those systems are reversed (perhaps have the 'losing side' have agents on gates w/ lower quality, occupying faction has agents in station w/ higher quality?). some form of pvp missions.. nice idea but i don't really see it happening unless it spawned a mission beacon that only a certain number of ships from each faction could enter at a given time, although this approach would lead to potential exploiting by using alts in opposing faction to fill up slots / get slaughtered by mains.... pirate fw.. yes please! just balance the pirate ships a bit more.also as graham said there are really ugly penalties for pilots repping outlaws participating in faction warfare in the sense they lose faction standings each rep cycle, also repping someone who sticks a smartbomb on and hits other faction members by accident leads to some really bad penalties per rep cycle, one of our pilots went from 8.0 faction standing to -3 faction standing due to repping a new member to fw who was not aware of this whilst other militia members flew through his smartbombs. this is a mechanic which could also be easily exploitable to destroy hard earned standings (which are not easily recovered).oh yes, another edit in here! more system resources available to fw related nodes, even when 'large' fleets do happen they're largely ruined due to the node crashing / lagging to hell with under 100 in local."
6/8/2010,"attacking random people? how does disrupting your target at a stargate affect you or any other neutral party? the chances are you don't even have anything targeted. if you read the proposal it clearly says ""stargates and stations only.""i'm not attacking anybody in that case, i am simply defending myself. as someone mentioned above, concord is not there to defend you, this means that players are supposed to defend themselves."
6/8/2010,"not supported. it would be heavily abused by faction warfare and alliances/corps in war (not all of the wars are about bad guys ganking carebears), ex. bringing a group of alts to ecm burst the hostile gang, thus potentially involving ""third party"" into conflict, be it a war between corps, fc or just attacking a player on witch you have kill rights. this was never meant to happen."
6/8/2010,"rr in highsec wars by different corps are abused too. yet somehow no one have problems with it, and they don't get concorded.so you got hit by ecm burst. it turns out to be abuse and not accident. so shoot the person. you've got kill right, sensor boost or use drones or something. what's the problem?"
6/8/2010,"if you read the original statement (which you didn't) it says only defending fleets can use it without consequence, thus your fleet needs to be attacked first. it also says ""strictly limited to stargates and stations."" if you can tell me how that can be abused, please do so, or please, do us all a favor and learn to comprehend what you read.""not all of the wars are about bad guys ganking carebears."" this isn't about the carebears (me), this is about the pvp pilots that escort me, far from carebears."
6/8/2010,":) you should do your self a favor and learn how to comprehend what you read. first of, most of the battles happen on stations and gates in eve !! secondly.. so if my fleet is attacked first i then can bring a bunch of alts and fire up ecm bursts without consequences ? how that makes any difference on the matter of ""third party"" involvement in war. i don't get you dear sir."
6/8/2010,"if i understand what you're saying is if group a aggro's group b, group b won't get concorded for using ecm bursts against (uninvolved) group c. how is that fair to group c? you say it's okay because ""oh they shouldn't have anything locked anyway."" if that's your logic then you should give me all your isk and assets because ""you shouldn't have any anyway."" as proposed, the proposal is fail. however, if it was ""group b, regardless of the actions of group a should not get concorded for hitting npcs and npc structures with an ecm burst"" that is then fair.i think what you really want, which would probably be a pretty good proposal, is a f.o.f. ecm burst. maybe as a script to a regular ecm burst. re-write your proposal so that group c doesn't get punished for a fight they have nothing to do with, and you'll likely get some better support."
6/8/2010,"exploit example:1. get a fleet of neutral ecm burst ships together.2. get an alt in an ibis to suicide on a single player in the ecm burst fleet.3. proceed to break all of your enemy's locks with your neutral fleet, without consequences."
6/8/2010,"as i said, a reasonable solution is only counting people who have a lock or are attempting to obtain one. if you disrupt someone who didn't have gcc or aggression, you get aggression (and almost certainly a gcc).the worst this system could be gamed is having 5 ecm burst ships sitting there for 5 successive lock breaks - not significantly worse than having 5 blackbirds ready to ecm your enemy. i'm also completely content with simply removing npcs from the aggression/gcc calculation (and for that matter i'm content with the way things are)...-liang"
6/8/2010,"so there's no neutral folk on the gate? no faction police officers? no gate guns, billboards, or gates? must be a pretty special gate. if those things don't exist, you don't get concorded. if thy do exist, you're attacking neutrals(whether that's your intention or not, it is the result of your actions), which the police dislike. if three dudes jump you in a barfight, you're not allowed to fight back with a flamethrower, no matter how much your intention is to defend yourself or how effective it might be. in an empty field, sure, but not when there's innocents nearby. find a more appropriate defence."
6/8/2010,the result of this would be out of corp toons ecm bursting all over the place in empire wars. high sec wars are already terrible enough with the out of corp logistics...
6/8/2010,"out of corp toons can't ecm burst if they are not attacked, my proposal still clearly states that you (or your fleet) needs to be attacked for concord not to intervene."
6/8/2010,"somebody attacks you does not give you the right to ecm burst all the other ships on the stargate. for example, if this proposal is implemented, i can suicide my alt onto my ship and proceed to break locks on the gate and screw with highsec warfare for a good 15 minutes."
6/8/2010,"you can't base aggro on fleet formations, or corp membership. it would open a good number of exploits and greifing possibilites. this affects so many aspects of the game. it if based on fleets people in wars wouldn't have a clue about the opposing forces. they could shoot a target and suddenly the whole system lights up as hostile because they where in fleet.outlaws would be able to help eachother if aggressed around sentries and there are probably a good number of other ways this would radically change the game.you could make a really complicated system with designated escorts that are ""approved"" by concord and visable to everyone as escorts i guess, but that is just overkill.what you did seems to have worked just fine so what is the problem here anyway?a ship with a ecm burst on doesn't cost anything anyhow..."
6/8/2010,"train that webbing alt to use smartbombs on their pods after concord kills them, sure you'll take a giant sec status loss, but just delete that alt and make another one :)"
6/8/2010,you know this is against the eula right?(edit: clearified quote)

6/8/2010,"none of those posts show any dev confirmation concerning the topic of recycling alts. a forum moderator said you can be banned for griefing by continually doing this, however, as suicide blobs are the actual aggressors, you're not griefing them.also, it's not like you recycle an alt every day to pod kill suicide blobs that attack your main character's freighter, at the very most you should only expect a suicide attack every months."
6/8/2010,would be wonderfully useful! very enthusiastically supported.
6/8/2010,"agreed.if the tooltip, or the right-click menu for a star (and get-info windows!), just told you the distance in ly and the cost in isotopes (if in a jump-capable ship), that alone would solve a lot of headaches. add coloring stars by range (both max range of your ship, and range with available fuel), and you've got the core of what you need.the rest is mostly eye-candy -- not that i have anything against candy, mind you, but meat-and-potatoes first."
6/8/2010,"well we have heard from past csm members and from our own experiences that ccp dont really interact with csm or even listen to a word they say.so whats the point of csm? ccp set this up and promised it would listen, but infact its just an empty promise and empty shell.look at the votes of support the waiting of scanning time got, have ccp responded? not at all.i think the whole concept of csm is great, but if ccp dont really recognise it or dont even listen to it then why really have it?it needs real teeth! so ccp step up to your promises and start listening to your players and the csm, and be accountable.what are your real values, visions and goals towards the player base and eveand to be honest my trust in ccp has died due to things like this."
6/8/2010,"if csm were allowed to make serious decisions that would be just bad tbh.as bad as ccp sometimes is, players sometimes really outdo them by several orders of magnitude when it comes to stupid suggestions."
6/8/2010,"even ccp show great capacity for extraordinarily bad decisions, the csm candidates tend to be egotistical freeloading wazzacks as opposed to actual game designers or towering intellects.the best people to decide how eve should develop are ccp. if they want to hire people to design the game, they can, and do. they probably hire some decent people as well as nepotised (that a word?) muppets.the csm isn't there to design eve. it's their to fill column inches in marketing editorial websites. what is called ""internal affairs"" is what we were first promised the csm would be. which is what i want the csm to be. except with the one small difference being the csm as internal affairs actually do things, bring people to account, publicly, harshly and without consideration as to whether it's the boss's son they're investigating.the csm is a poor joke. internal affairs is a poor joke. ccp never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity."
6/8/2010,the csm as it is elected now is pretty terrible. you get people who are seriously bias or just plain trolls and not a very good representation of the whole player base at all.i think ccp should be involved in picking candiates if this is to go on. setup some criteria for the various csm posts and screen nominations. like a job application.then the player base can vote between a few by ccp selected candidates. this way they can ensure they get a good representation and not just trolls or representatives for the largest alliance...they could also hire a dude of there own that is actually paid to screen and evaluate player suggestions and brainstorming and discuss with the community. though he would have to get a troll vaccination first...
6/8/2010,"please explain to me how ""bias"" is a problem."
6/8/2010,well if you get a dude into the csm that is really into something no one cares about ... like say building stuff on planet. then if ccp listens to him they will spend alot of time and resources on something no one cares about.more likely is that they will be sorting out problem of a very specific warfare tactic or something of this sort. it is naturally a problem if you don't get a good representation of the player base but people promoting special interests in the csm. just like in every f*ing other democracy in the world...
6/8/2010,perfect!
6/8/2010,"how do you tell whether an opinion is widely or narrowly held? i mean, you can poke around on the forums, but forum *****s aren't normal players, and there aren't really very many of us. or you can ask the players as a whole which program of action that they like. the whole purpose of the csm is to use that second method. if someone builds a platform around a particular issue and finishes with a csm seat, that would seem to imply that there's at least a decent number of people who like that opinion. if the rest of the csm goes along with it, that would seem to imply that there's no strong opposition to the idea from the other eight, which generally means it's not crazy. your doomsday scenario consists of a lot of people liking a candidate, the csm saying that the idea is a good one, and ccp deciding that it's both good enough and a high enough priority to actually code. if all that happens, then maybe you should look into the possibility that it's not actually a bad idea."
6/8/2010,uhm... station background sounds fade away after a short period of time (1 min maybe). ccp already added that in tyrannis. this also happens with rat sounds.
6/8/2010,"it's still highly annoying, especially the chanting, since it can't be disabled any way.if i turn of eve music, because i'm running music from another source, or watching a movie on my 2nd monitor, i'd like to not be interruptedby some religious nuts, chanting around my ship."
6/8/2010,"then you shouldn't dock in amarr stations, perhaps?i dunno, i just don't think it's an important issue."
6/8/2010,"i'm based in amarr. to leave amarr space because some in-station chanting won't go away would not be a good reason.and it actually doesn't go away after a minute. that might be true for other faction stations but it stays in amarr stations.it sucks when docked and trying to watch a movie or youtube on the other monitor. i have to go into audio settings to disable all audio so it won't interfere with other sound related activities. that doesn't make sense to me. i might chat and do other casual things in eve while watching something else so exiting the client doesn't make sense either.i agree, not a horribly pressing issue, but nevertheless annoying and hopefully addressed someday."

6/8/2010,"i am afraid this proposal doesn't get my approval, the amount of extra calculation involved and the griefing potential is astronomical.we are trying to alleviate lag, this proposal would crash nodes in low sec with 20 in local, we are already getting node crashes with 90 in low sec and 150 in 0.0 which i expect to get worse with stupid planet mining after dt today."
6/8/2010,"i have been doing some more research on this, and have come up with a draft issue proposal for comments. the big change is that i realized the proposal should be careful to address the needs of color-blind players -- if there are any color-blind players reading this thread, please let me know if the changes are appropriate! this is in wiki format:== summary ==overloading modules is a crucial pvp game-mechanic, but the current user interface is difficult to operate and error-prone.* unless a keyboard shortcut is used, activating overload requires either clicking a tiny area at the top of a module button, or accessing a contextual menu. both of these methods are error-prone and can easily result in the module becoming deactivated.* once overload has been toggled (either on, or off), there is no visual indication that the command has been accepted until the start of the next cycle. additionally, an erroneous command cannot be corrected until after the start of the next cycle.* the overload activation cue is just the change in the intensity of the color of the small overload activation area at the top of the module button. it is needlessly difficult to determine the state of the module.in addition to the difficulties faced by all players in managing overloading, players who are color-blind face particular challenges in effectively using the module buttons, because they have difficulty distinguishing between red and green hues, which are used in the pulsing halos that surround activated modules.== solution ==the current colors associated with module buttons are green and red. according to information on["
6/8/2010,sounds good. :)
6/8/2010,sounds good but i'd still like to see a bigger or more click friendly overload button be part of the solutions you listed.
6/8/2010,"the proposed shift(ctrl/alt)-click method kind of eliminates the need of buttons, providing cleaner interface, in addition, it would prevent accidental overloading (which happens also, because the overload button is directly on top of the module activation button)."
6/8/2010,"this is an interesting suggestion, actually. several issues that immediately come to mind (if anyone else has things to add, please do so):a larger overload area also means easier to mis-click and activate.changing the general button look means artwork changes (= more work).the current overload area is already often partially hidden behind the button type badge (for example, by the ammo of guns). a larger area with the current layout would be more hidden, and so it would be harder to figure out where the click area is.on the plus size, a change here could also help those eve players with physical limitations that make modifier-click combinations difficult to enter.if you (or anyone else) can come up with a sketch of a button redesign that addresses these issues, then with a little more work this could be added to the proposal. perhaps things could be worded so that the proposal contains sub-proposals (modifier-click, halo changes, button design changes) which can be independently considered for implementation."
6/8/2010,"there is a lot of unused space around the buttons, some of the problems you mentioned about making them bigger could be alleviated through use of that space. for instance the over heating buttons could be a little circle the same size as the rack overheating buttons that is half on half off the module circles at a corner of a circle rather then the top. this would also alleviate the issue of cycle bars occluding the button (or module icons as well which is annoying).really i don't think its much work for the art dept. to figure out solutions if they have a guy who can draw concept design for a bs in half an hour. and honestly i wouldn't mind them spending a little time figuring out improvements for the ui regardless of what ever else it is they are doing. if nothing else you can present it and let ccp decide, a hot key or modified click is better then now for sure, but really only goes half way i think."
6/8/2010,"i support some form of improvement to the overheating setup, those proposed by trebor look pretty solid.it's frustrating when your overheating goes fubar"
6/8/2010,ui improvement = automatic support
6/8/2010,anything that improves the ui (and this would) has my support.
6/8/2010,anything that improves usability gets my vote. i hate that tiny sliver.edit to tick support
6/8/2010,"i really like this idea a lot!i personally would make the overheat buttons as large as possible. they might, for example, modify the button so one quadrant (top-left or top-right?) would be more like the corner of a square, so there's a nice triangular area to click in."
6/8/2010,"the csm proposal is up on the wiki here.i would appreciate any comments and suggestions, it can still be tweaked for the next 24 hours or so."
6/8/2010,supported on the basis of fitts' law

6/8/2010,"as far as i can see highsec wars are just broken game mechanic that should never have been there in the first place. it's both far too easy to be abused by highsec pirates, and even more easily dodged by the pirated. the fee is chump change, for alliance too.it's just a tool for highsec pirates lacking the spines to go to lowsec, who poach miners and indistrials instead. and the said non-combat toons would just swap fake corps or even alliances (1b isn't that much for traders/industrialists), or cross-dec with fake corps, or use any number of ways to dodge it. the only people who get stuck are noobs who don't have money or don't know better."

6/8/2010,"assembly hall description:""a platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar management.""features and ideas discussion description:""get feedback on your game-related ideas and suggestions from our developers and the rest of the community.""- voting mechanism should be built for fid section of the forum with positive and negative votes. each suggestion thread should be given a fixed period of trial time (1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks...???). during that time you can discuss, support or vote against the suggestion. - assembly hall section should be locked for making new threads by players (like eve information portal).- a suggestion in fid section must have minimum required positive votes to be transfered to the assembly hall.- a suggestion in fid section must have minimum required percentage of the positive votes to be transfered to the assembly hall.- suggestions that have met the requirements before the expiration of a trial period would be automatically moved to the assembly hall where they could be further discussed.- threads with suggestions that haven't met the requirements would be automatically locked after the trial period have passed.this would not require additional forum moderation because troll posts, irrelevant and plain stupid ideas from people that don't understand the basic game mechanics will be filtered by the community itself before even getting to the csm. this would not limit the democracy, but only filter the topics that are relevant to the csm.assembly hall should be a place where you can discuss ideas that makes sense, not where you dig through dozens of fail/troll posts. csm general effectiveness would greatly benefit from this also."
6/8/2010,"don't stop there, just replace the csm with a forum poll. ccp aren't stupid, they can count results, just look at the overanalysis of the isk faucets/sinks they refer to as an ""economy"" in the qen, or the csm results, they can count those till cows come home...so yeah. winner. forum poll.whichever forum polls get the highest count, ccp have to promise to faithfully that they will come up with lip service first instead of silently ignoring them and doing whatever they want to do."
6/8/2010,forum polls can be sabotaged just as easily.if not bull####ted.
6/8/2010,"if you find me a forum poll with 40,000 votes, i'll agree with that. until then, the csm reps provide better representation than any forum poll ever will."

6/8/2010,this may be a buggy overview issue on my end so deleting the post.
6/8/2010,you are joking right ? :)
6/8/2010,posting in a deleted thread.
6/8/2010,i think it should be possible to swap your portrait to other races or at least make an option to make a character portrait that looks good within every bloodline. for example i think the achura bloodline has some very limited choices when it comes to making a portrait. an achura toon can choose to either have 1 specific shape of eyebrows or none at all.so if you are not going to allow race swapping which i think you should then you should make a lot more customization available for portrait making.with regardsghost
6/8/2010,"hahahaha i laugh at you foolish achura! i imagine though, that should incarna ever role around in the mythical future people are going to have another shot at character design."
6/8/2010,well it is possible according to eve chronicles to swap faces.
6/8/2010,rumors say you can redo your portrait better with incarna. but i think the bloodline restriction should stay.
6/8/2010,"caps mostly stay where they are, lives and dies there, they don't go to highsec. moon farming is a major source of income, doesn't mean there aren't others. it's like how most people think of missions as highsec isk faucet, when insurance fraud was actually also a much bigger slice of the pie then they realize, before insurance got gimped. if you can look at the wallet of some of those corps, you'd be surprised how much 10-15% of 23/7 macro-ratting adds up.it won't break up sov null alliances. just weaken them."
6/8/2010,"sure, reduce the income from ratting and mining and watch the high-end moon materials skyrocket. i would love to hear your opinion when hulk price breaks 500 mil isk and t2 modules cost triples.wrong. they will grow even more to cover the wallet gap by sheer numbers or merge other alliances with similar goals around them making new powerblocks. and one more thing. do you really think that big alliances live from mining and ratting? individual players maybe, but alliances - no.what this has to do with powerblocks is beyond me.do i smell troll here, or are you that unfamiliar with the game? t2 stuff materials are already located in 0.0"
6/8/2010,"courier missions are literally the most boring thing imaginable. they do nothing but waste player time for isk. they require no skill, save to scout low-sec gates, and consist solely of moving from one system to another. furthermore they are incredibly vulnerable to macroing. people have talked about how they should or shouldn't be improved, but seriously: what is the point of them? why even bother keeping them? surely there are better ways to implement noncombat missions than this mindless busywork."
6/8/2010,supporting myself.
6/8/2010,"they make sense and provide an easy way to get your standings up without having to focus on combat or mining related skills. standings are so basic game mechanic, that there needs to be a way for most professions to gain them. there might be better ways ways for non-combat/non-mining to get standings, but since all missions are basicly just mindless grinding, courier missions aren't much worse than the alternatives."
6/8/2010,combat missions are just as boring. the only bearable way to get standings in this game is to do couriers for fast storyline.
6/8/2010,"this. i hate them, but they're a valid and necessary game mechanic."
6/8/2010,"new rules:1: systems under the occupancy of an empire will no longer allow those allied to enemy empires to dock in occupied systems. (militias must occupy a system to dock)2: imperial mission availability is effected by how deep into enemy territories an empire's occupancy extends.

(some special case would be needed for the situation when one a faction occupies the entire warzone). ideally, weight the number of plexes per wave by player load. during way off peak hours only one or two might spawn. on peak would more likely see five or whatever the max number of plexes per wave is. remove the npcs."

6/9/2010,"not sure this is the best solution but i'm supporting this because destroyers have needed work for a long, long time."
6/9/2010,no your wrong i would love for them to refund my sp's and i would take full advanage of starting sleeper accounts for r&d datacores. i'm just saying it ant going to happen anytime soon.you see there are more problems then just giving the sp's to people that already trained this skills it removes alot of barrers for older players to explot too.edit whats to stop older players from starting a fresh training first thing for +% implants and speed training to r&d on the toons one account and just sleeping it. nothing and you can now do it in so much faster if you bypass learning skills.this is just one possablity. its also has to do with why you can only train one toon at a time on one account should we though that out the door too?i would love to see training skills go and beable to train all 3 toons on my account at the same time i'm all for it but to get ccp to say its wrong and were going to change that is easy. to get them to realy change it thats a hole differnt ball of wax.
6/9/2010,"this man bring sup the first relevant point i've seen in this thread: vulnerability to exploitation. i personally believe the exploitation risk is fairly minor, but i have no hard and fast counters to this because industry isn't my game.----------------------------------------i've been thinking about this for a few days, and i haven't really changed my mind; i saw one post in another thread, they basically said that learning skills are optional in the same way that legs are optional. you won't die without them, and you can still get around, but it's generally going to be extremely slow and inefficient, and good luck competing with anybody else who isn't also missing limbs.the fact is, there is a skill race. that skill race has a cap in the way that you can only get so efficient at piloting a specific ship, and the returns are diminishing, but ultimately, there is a race. it'd be different if we were just wandering around whacking wolves for 20 exp a piece, but this isn't a standard mmo; eve is, and always has been, very pvp centric.if you're going to get learning skills, you're going to have to spend a lot of time learning them when you could be learning skills that actually provide some useful purpose. if you're not going to get learning skills, you're crippled compared to those who are. it doesn't matter if you get learning skills right away or after 5 years or spread out over the space of six months, you're still going to be burning that time. and if you're going to get them, the sooner you get them, the better off you are in the long run.but i really need to say this hard and fast: without the speed increase from the learning skills, eve is horrendously slow. that's a completely subjective opinion, but given how many people have high level learning skills, i'm going to take a stab and guess that a lot of people agree with me."

6/9/2010,must have
6/9/2010,so you then also would assert that blasters are balanced as well? worse dps and range than both autocannons and pulse lasers...having to spend most of a fight moving into range is fkin annoying.
6/9/2010,"because of missiles and drones, duhamong caldari ships missile boats are used way more often then railboats. and domi & ishtar are probably most popular gallente ships.rails could use a boost, but isn't there already a big topic about it?"
6/9/2010,i can not support this change with out you at the same time giving good missile and good drone ships to all the other races.add good guns ships to gallente give then add good drone ships to ammar. add good guns ships to caldair add good missile ships to mins.
6/9/2010,"blasters could use a range buff of some sort, with autocannons getting boosted as well (so that autocannons stay the ""intermediate short range"" gun). rails.... well, if beams are high dps, and arties are high alpha, why not make rails the longest range? seems fair to me..."
6/9/2010,rails platform is already the turret platform that can get an optimal range beyond the locking range. (rokh with 425mm rails and spike ammo).
6/9/2010,"supported. they're supposed to be ""hybrid"" - a cross between a projectile and an energy weapon. so let's see them placed between the two."

6/9/2010,"those examples suck for drone/missileboats, and you know it. ac and blasters do not need more range, if they were to keep that dps. you just want amar to have their @ss handed to them. well, others are gonna switch too, it won't help you in the long run. it'll just imbalance the game and create even more loopsided populations.this thread screams ""buff me, gimp everyone else."""
6/9/2010,i like it though the usual suspects are already making a mockery of intelligent debate.
6/9/2010,"this doesn't even make sense. my argument was that he says arty is fine, but a weapon system with better range and better dps is not fine. yes, arty has some advantages - cap use and damage switching, most notably - but he was making a raw stats argument, and the raw stats say that a railgun is better than an artillery cannon. blasters, on the other hand, specifically trade off range in favour of more dps. they're the highest-dps weapons in the game, but they have the shortest range. the question there is whether the tradeoff is worth it - do you get enough dps to make up for the loss of range? at present, i'd say that you probably don't, and that blasters could use some tweaking(some tracking love, say). but it's a sensible enough design, and i have nothing against it. and amazingly enough, that's exactly how it works now. where did you ever get that idea? they're nothing at all like half-laser, half-projectile weapons."
6/9/2010,"supported. gallente hybrids feel broken to me, to the point where i crosstrained to amarr for lasers. as much as i love blasters, they need fixing."
6/9/2010,"i fully support giving missions dynamic content. i also fully support making missions viable in pvp style fits - it should be an option to be able to better run a mission in an armor buffer than in a duel rep. it should also be possible to be able to choose whether to use longrange weapons or shortrange (i want to be able to use blasters!!!). a level 4 should drop you into a small gang of 1-2 bs's, and maybe a cruiser or two, plus a couple of tackling frigs, which can do 2000+dps if they all get you into their optimal. make it into a pvp style encounter, and each bs worth 5+mil. and make exactly what setup you go against random.this, imo, would make pve far more entertaining, and make it possible to actually do pve in a ship that can fight effectively in pvp.-arazel"
6/9/2010,yes.
6/9/2010,"im not really sure if i should support this yes or no. yes, mission running feels as broken as an asian mmo grind, and definitely could use some revamping.the one thing i am worried about with dynamic content is the influence it could have on the sandbox. if the dynamic content is implemented as you proposed, will the outcome of the dynamic content be fully influenced by player actions? with different outcomes for individual players based on individual choices? or will players be forced to set a predetermined (scripted) path (with 1 or 2 variations of the outcomes)? second thing, how many players do you propose would have to partake in such a mission in order to have any impact? will it be individually based or group based? or multiple individuals doing thesame mission solo? (in this case i'm worried about a single player trying his very best, and completing allot of missions, but his actions have no influences because there are not enough of other people doing the missions)third point, if you propose people to work in groups, how will this affect lowsec missions? trust is a very scarce commodity in eve, and is earned through hard work, and i do not forsee people grouping up very fast, especially when in lowsec you can pop the other guy after he did the work for you. at that point i also would not like to see any mechanic to prohibit that, because in the eve sandbox all choices should be yours to make.last comment, i do support the improvement of ai, but what are your thoughts on how this will effect the current economy? ratting is a major income in 0.0 space, and yes, i would like for it to be more fun, but if the difficulty of ratting is increased by a huge bit, thus making it harder/longer to kill them, it will give less income to players. now i am not qq'ing about less cash, i would see it as a setback, especially if you are active in pvp and need to replace ships on regular basis.anyways ahnk, if you can get a more interesting way of missioning working, please do so, because tbh anything is better then the current state of mission grinding. if you can give any feedback on my questions or give some more explanation it will be greatly appreciated. :)"
6/9/2010,"would it be game breaking to make low-sec gate guns speed tankable?as of right now, low sec pvp is for battleship pilots only (unless you have relaly good cruiser and heavy dictor skills)."
6/9/2010,or shoot people off of gates and stations
6/9/2010,"you mean ""lowsec gatecamping is not for frigates"", which is just fine. want to gatecamp in lowsec, get a big, expensive and vulnerable ship. there's no issue there."
6/9/2010,this.
6/9/2010,yes this would chance the game radically and make low-sec much more similar to 0.0 in terms of travel safety.now unless you are an outlaw it is very unlikely that someone will manage to tackle your small ship on a gate in low-sec. it takes a well setup gate-camp with remote sensor boosted hics or special assault frigates and good logistics to the be able to snatch small stuff on gates.if any stray interceptor could tank the gate guns not so much...
6/9/2010,i can tank sentries in my skimitar. try getting one of those.
6/9/2010,"we could use more people in lowsec, not less. it's empty enough as is."
6/9/2010,"allowing frigate-sized ships to safely engage in pvp at gates will make it even more vacant, as there will be more risk of being ganked."
6/9/2010,isn't that why it's called low-sec? the security status losses are enough. supported
6/9/2010,the reason low-sec is vacant is because no one wants to risk the expensive ships that are required in low sec to pvp (battleships). it's too dangerous to even bring a hac to the damn gates (which makes up a considerable portion of pvp pilots).
6/9/2010,"if your gang is prepared you can bring hacs to a gate camp.anyway ... to the frigates ... there is plenty of frigate pvp in lowsec. especially in the faction warfare areas. gate camping is a tough one true. but if you are fast, you can land the suicide tackle and warp out before the gate guns kill you. or you end up as suicide tackle. (hope you got a lot of ships ;)that said ... if your corp mates sit on the gate for camping. run belts or neighboring systems. maybe you find some targets.p.s.: if you start shooting pirates, sentries are so kind to look away. might be an option to consider :)not supported."
6/9/2010,"not supported, if anything i think the gate guns could use a boost to cut back on gate camping. it's a bit too easy to tank in big ships, especially if you have several of them. i think if gate travel were made a bit safer, it would result in atleast some increase in low sec traffic thus making it more interesting.and btw, if you want to gate camp in a frigate in low sec, join fw. it can be fun at times running around low sec in a fleet of 20+ faction frigates and camping some of the major arteries."
6/9/2010,hell no. there will be insta-locking inties on every lowsec gate camp.
6/9/2010,"nah, keep gate guns as it is. a decent bc can tank the guns, so thats quite affordable."

6/9/2010,"u mean the consequences of ship loss, sec loss, and the t1 insurance nerf? u mean the lack of consequences of a t2 mining ship in high sec? oh ok--'cause then i don't see why eve needs to have a 100% safe blue zone u have in wow, since we already have stations..."
6/9/2010,consequences of actions matter more than lack of actions.supported.
6/9/2010,"since when? since ppl cry so much about the mineral prices all over the universe 'cause they've been oversupplied to death by overuse of otherwise riskless t2 mining? lack of action against this is what caused that, fyi. and r the high sec belts deserted like low sec? no? ok, then--that means the system is working as intended (to be more precise, in the miner's favor), considering that suicide ganking is an intended mechanic."
6/9/2010,"i don't recall op, or anyone who supported this crying about mineral prices. if you or some other ppl do, it's your/their problem.subsidies for suicide ganking is not an intended mechanic, suicide ganking itself is. the insurance company would rather not pay for your insurance fraud."
6/9/2010,"it's irrelevant who's crying about it--the fact is, it exists because many ppl overuse this riskless profession. and when prices drop universally, it becomes other ppl's problem, whether u're able to understand that or not.actually, it is intended, just like how low sec pirating is subsidized. otherwise, they would've removed insurance from all criminal acts, high sec and low sec included. do u know what else would void insurance irl? taking a vehicle into a war zone and losing it, regardless of criminal involvement, aka anywhere in space, where u can get shot at. then again, this isn't real life..."
6/9/2010,"majority of minerals come from missioners/ratters rather than miners. it's also besides the point, as op and supporters didn't whine about mineral prices. if you(since you brought it up) or someone else do whine, it's your/their problem. deal with it.insurance fraud is when you buy insurance before performing an action that intentionally destroys the item insured. probability of destruction: 100%legitimate insurance buying is when you buy insurance for an item that is under risk. probability of destruction: less than 100%"
6/9/2010,"that's the same excuse every miner makes in defense of their riskless profession. likewise, if your exhumer is being blown up, u deal with it instead of crying about that.so an insurance company would accept a 99% probability? either case, u're expecting it to be destroyed, otherwise, u would not buy the insurance in the first place. if it's likely enough for u to lose it that u have to buy insurance for it in the first place, it's gonna happen enough so that insurance companies would go out of business either way, ""legitimate"" or not. just because it's ""legitimate"" to u, doesn't mean the insurance company would accept the terms irl, so your logic is faulty, both irl and in eve. then again, this isn't real life, so that's why they don't have a choice in the matter so it's accepted for all."
6/9/2010,"i don't have an exhumer, and i don't mine.as i said, insurance fraud is 100% probability of destruction. it was your intention from the beginning to get the ship destroyed and get payment.normal eve insurance buying is less than 100% probability of destruction. you know you're taking a risk, therefore insures the ship to guard against that risk.the difference is ""destroy the ship on purpose and collect the payout"" vs. ""trying to keep the ship alive in pvp, but not always succeeding."" one is insurance fraud, other is pvp.not sure how much clearer i can explain it."
6/9/2010,"if this is to go through, ccp best get on it now. there are so many other things that will need to be considered. for example, a whole new set of trade commodities will need to be created, such as, baby oil, mud, jello, bikinis, etc... will evetv be covering this. can we get this feed in high def?there will need to be advertisements for color commentators. will there be a tournament set up or a free-for-all? concord will have to be bribed or distracted. windows and closet doors will need to be assembled around the hellcat's home system for the peeping toms. so much to do...."
6/9/2010,i support pillow fights.
6/9/2010,allow players to replace their command center on a planet with one of a different level. i imagine this would be as simple as changing the target cc level in the database then destroying the cc in the hold of the ship you're flying.
6/9/2010,"i agree with this.at present, to upgrade a planet, you need to wipe the slate clean and start again, which also means losing any products that have been produced, or any components waiting for more advanced processors.my guess is that it is just an oversight and should be fixed very soon."
6/9/2010,works for me.
6/9/2010,yes. more of this.

6/9/2010,"there are many times when a warning window comes up. there are two options. yes - to proceed, or no- to disengage.as of right now, if you hit enter or any other similar key, ccp has the default on yes. although this is fine for most things (like jetting ore out of ship), it is a problem for other things like ""if you proceed you will be attacked by concord and suffer a sec status loss."" i cannot say how many times i have lost ships to quickly hitting enter, under the subconscious thought that it would register as no - to disengage.proposal: set the default to no for all criminal (and other negative) actions."

6/9/2010,"so, we all know that remote ecm bursts aren't worth a damn and this is why, to those who have never used one: once you activate it, it takes 20 seconds (minus proj. ecm skill level) to actually fire a brust and break the lock of targets within 20km.so with this said, i propose that ccp at least makes it so it actually jams the targets for about 5-10 seconds, instead of the current 20, so it's not too overpowered in a gang of supercarriers. oh, and make it have a cool effect, like smartbombish.in regards to the actual skill, i propose that it reduces the capacitor usage of the module by 5% per level, or maybe the reactivation delay, which seems reasonable.support (or flame) away."

6/9/2010,you can do that already. just make a courier contract for the ship. the courier contract limit got increased to the size of the largest freighter a few patches back. now you can carry up to 2 fitted and rigged battleships in a freighter.
6/9/2010,"yes, the courier workaround exists, but it should be possible to do it without needing to flip things between alts and ruin insurance. and i'm fine with carrying containers only if they're packaged - no cargo expansion on freighters."
6/9/2010,having a work-around is not the same as a working mechanic.
6/9/2010,"they will never (or should never) let you put assembled cans in a freighter. the reason should be obvious-- a gsc takes up 3k space, but holds 3.9k. its the same reason why carriers (can no longer) carry ships with anything but ammo and charges in thier hold.secondly, it just doesn't make sense to put assembled ships into a freighter. it would be akin to bringing an assembled tent in your car when you go camping in the woods."
6/9/2010,no it would be like putting a assembled car in the hold of a truck which makes sense to me. or would you take it apart and then transport it?
6/9/2010,"why not simply make a ship class that can carry assembled ships but has no jump drive?make it slightly larger than the carriers ship bay, maybe 3 bs sized. and utilize all the rules of regular ship maintenance bay transport. suddenly, you've solved the highsec movement issue.as for the assembled cans. i don't see it happening at all. use courier contracts. otherwise, as mentioned, it will make their holds ridiculously large for the devoted pilot."

6/9/2010,"i would like to propose that ccp start focusing on some details in the game and dont push in more content. imo eve need a bit of help to get in shape and back on track to be the game it once was.it feels like way to many pilots are quite upset over this patch.lag being one big reason. i remember when ccp had several dev blogs braging and showing of how they improved the lag situation. for a while there things went rly well and you could have a 1000 pilot fight in 00 with decent lag. recently it seems like the lag have increased allot and you have now big issues to control it. removing brackets, turning effects off and running on minimum settings does not cut it. you find yourself outlagged in fights with just a 200 in system. decissions decissions... either eve is a fleet game and then some focus need to be made on that. or eve is not a fleet game and should be adapted to small scale combat. eve is ofc not just pvp but in the end that is what everything leads to. everyone in high sec that claim they dont want that is cool to say it, but what they do helps others to keep the fights up in another place.small bugs, fixes or other things... it was some time since the forums was loaded with several several threads about how bad something is. i remember the never ending rage on amarr... but now there is no rage on anything special. still there is plenty of small things that need a bit of attention. i only ask ccp to hold up and look at the game. dedicate some quality time and focus on what once was before you keep running out and create new cool things. thx for me :)flame away."
6/9/2010,agreed... this is the best time to stop and take the time to clean up. (ignoring the oblivious moar pvp and less pve comments)the real issue is more technical than in-game mechanics (although they have some issues there too)like the mac client base of which is really ****ed right now. (trust me... it's not pretty)right now i feel like they aren't even testing there own bloody product in-house and they spend more time pushing it on the guys who live in singularity and honestly they don't outnumber the general population in tranquility that much.biggest issue is all this new content is causing a distinct bloatedness... and it's got me really concerned.i'm willing to bet good isk that that is really the main cause of the lag problems.. it's just not so obvious because we tend to blame other things.smells/feels too much like windows xp ---> windows vista ---> windows 7 to me.many little problems that still haven't been fixed... but keeps looking better and has more features.time to hit the brakes...and get around to fixing the really nasty bugs that drive people up the wall.the game was very clean cut and good at apoc... now its just worse than dominion. yay... new ship skins and pi... but what about all that other crud that still is causing problems hmm?supported.ps: i'd be very embarrassed right now if i pushed crash reporting only to find out it was total epic fail-ness. seriously... you'd think they would have bothered to test there own program before releasing it... how the heck do you expect to keep customers if you pull crap like that? people can only take so much of that before they walk away.
6/9/2010,"thankswhat is ccps plan rly.is it only money that drives them and if so this thread is hopeless.i rly hope somehow ccp can listen to thier members and make the most for the game. aplying new stuff cool and fun, specially for those that havent palyed that long. tho when new things gets introduced before old things are fixed it is rly sad.id be interessted to read what ccps plan with eve is. what is the goal for the game and what do they want it to be and become.eve have loads of things to offer and if you got the time and imagination you can never grow tierd of it. but when you see how fun a thing is and you rly lvoe it, but the game mechanic destroys it... that is wrong."
6/9/2010,"one idea i have to bring more individual people into low sec for mining is if there was a mechanism that took care of most or all of the steps of mining i.e. mining, hauling, refining and made it into a single step.what if we could strap a warp drive onto a roid, put a energy transfer on it for warp, and warp it to a few roid eating specialized station found only in low sec(would also create a combat hot spot). the kicker would be that it takes say... 3 mins to strap a warp drive onto the roid and 1-3 mins to transfer enough energy for warp.of course this could only be done in low sec, because for role play reasons the factions thinks its dangerous to strap warp drives on roids in high sec, and null sec stations don't have the equipment. doing this in null should increase travel travel time by several multiples or should not be possible at all or should result in diminishing returns.to balance the influx of roids would be the time spent in transit. no one would be strapping warp drives on roids in the same system of the specialized stations, since there would be so many people looking for kills, so they would have to send the roid light years away, for reference going 5 light years at 3 au/s takes 1.2 days. refining the roid could take maybe 1 day then one would have haul it out of low sec for use...one last thing is that i hope there is'nt a new class of ships that can only do this. id like to see big battleships to frigs able to do this, mind you bigger ships can fit larger energy transfers."
6/9/2010,"no, i am not in favour of generating new, weird, and even more boring ways to mine ore in hopes of possibly solving the lowsec mining problem."
6/9/2010,"would it actually be more boring? you're committing a battleship, or what have you, for 4-7 minutes which is about 2 mining cycles, there is huge risk of combat in every step, and it would require much less player input.edit. opps alt poast. also i am not a miner, i have never spent more than 1 hour my entire time in eve mining..."
6/9/2010,"not gonna support... people like mining for some reason. the key to start fixing mining is to nerf macro miners without hurting legitimate miners. once the macros are out and the mineral prices balance, then it's time to figure out a way to make it more fun. propose a way to nerf macro miners w/o hurting legitimate players and you'll have my support, and probably the support of thousands of miners."
6/9/2010,"due to the low production rate of extractors in high sec, many components stand idle waiting for raw materials to gather in abundance. during this time, however, they consume full cpu and power. its easy to destroy them when they are not required, but that then costs isk to rebuild them. what about .. ""standby"".i propose 2 levels of standby level 1 ""offline"" consumes 50% of normal power and cpu when in standby mode consumes 100% of normal power and cpu when ""offlining"" consumes 150% of normal power and cpu when ""onlining"" online/offline takes 1 hour level 2 ""mothballed"" consumes 10% of normal power and cpu when in standby mode consumes 100% of normal power and cpu when ""offlining"" consumes 150% of normal power and cpu when ""onlining"" online/offline takes 24 hourscommand centres - no standby modelinks - no standby modeextractors can only be put into standby mode when not mining cannot route products when in standbyprocessors must stop processing before being put into standby mode cannot route products when in standby any items in store are lost when entering standbystorage cannot route products when in standby any items in store are lost when entering standbyspace ports cannot route products when in standby cannot send or receive goods when in standby any items in store are lost when entering standbythe use of this mode would be to run one set of extractors for a few days, then another set to build up a stockpile, while processors are mothballed. then you standby the extractors and fire up the processors until the products are all generated. then mothball the processors and repeat. this enables you to gather all of the products required for various process jobs, without having to destroy and then re-build extractors and processors all of the time."
6/9/2010,"you're allowed to have multiple extractors per processor, you know. if 1:1 makes sense in 0.0, and highsec is 1/3 as good, make it a 3:1 ratio. it's not totally crazy, but i don't think it is at all necessary."
6/9/2010,"only 3:1???on the planets around here, 0.5 sec, i have installed between 4 and 8 extractors to match the pace with a single basic processor.if i want to take the next step, constant tier 2 production means ...1 advanced processor4 basic processors24 extractors (based on 6:1)storage+ linkseven without the links, that's 6600 cpu and 23800 power - not even an elite command centre can match that. being able to alternate between an ""extraction week"" and a ""processing week"" would be helpful.."

6/9/2010,make it so!
6/9/2010,"this also.i've said it before, and i'll say it again - i'thari, you're a frickin genius."
6/9/2010,supporting this issue once again.
6/9/2010,would love to see the meta lvl on the inventory icon.
6/9/2010,this issue has previously been raised by csm and has been approved and submitted to ccp.
6/9/2010,make missions a commodity that can be brought and sold via contracts. market dictates price. not restricted by buyer standings.
6/9/2010,"my corp has been war deced several times in the past few weeks. i'd have to say that it hasn't been fun! we aren't a small corp either.i ask that when there is a war dec all alts on the same account and all alts on other accounts created by the same person (billing or contact information) be valid targets. if the war is declared mutual then all alts be considered valid war targets on both sides. if the war is not mutual then only alts on the decing side are valid targets.i know that everyone is going to say that this has always been a part of eve but honestly in rl unless you are some sort of spy or identity thief...you don't get to have eyes on your target at all times. cva fell because of similar issues.haven't you heard of the fog of war? there is none in this game and no element of surprise. it's one thing to have a cloaked ship...it's another to have your enemy right next to you and able to sum up your entire fleet with the press of a button and for you to not be able to do anything about it. without the fog of war everything comes down to numbers, skill points and types of ships. this would solve the remote repping problem...for an honest netural to remote rep is one thing...for some alt char to remote rep is just down right cheating."
6/9/2010,you pay isk to be able shoot everyone in a certain corporation or alliance. that is all you should get. if their alts bother you dec that corp/alliance too.
6/9/2010,"i""m not talking about the corp that does the war decing being able to shoot at any alts. i'm talking about the defending corp that was deced being able to shoot at alts. so the paying corp doesn't get to shoot at alts. also most ""eyes"" are in noob corps so declaring a war on a noob corp with countless members probably isn't a good idea...if it's even possible??? at least one fleet that was roaming in cva space right before they fell was nothing but neutrals cloaked up in completely random corps. so in a null sec example you'd have to war dec about 20 different corps just to be able to attack members of that fleet 24 hours after they already ganked you. (but null sec right so why bother?) my point is if you use alts to stab corp members in the back or if you use alts as eyes so no one knows who you really are...or if you use alts to form a fleet in null sec and attack your enemy (for corps that are nrds in null sec this obviously is a problem)...there should be a way to track the connection between alts in game."
6/9/2010,"it cant happen because of same reason you cant outlaw alts, you can never know which alts belongs to who for sure (and ccp earns too much money due to it).tbh he has a point. high sec wardeccers usually are telling the mining/mission running/rookie corporations they wardec that eve is a pvp game and they shouldnt complain, while at the same time they have alts for their own completely risk free isk making."
6/9/2010,let me get this straight.you want more war targets and your tired of war-dec's.yeah... makes sense...ps: i dare you to have the foolishness to tell me that only you can shoot said alternates. that's just begging to get trolled.
6/9/2010,"yes, the game won't know it's an alt if it's on different accounts. this won't work."
6/9/2010,i don't know how much more i can explain this. if a corp is going to try and defend itself from a war dec it needs to be able to attack the pirate corp that is attacking them. if the pirate corp can have eyes on you at all times and know exactly what your fleet is doing...and you have no way to stop that...how can you even consider building a fleet to counter attack when the pirate corp has spent every second of their eve time training their toons skills up for tech 2 guns and tech 2/faction ships. you come in with a fleet of all battleships and they have a fleet twice your size just waiting. you come in with 1 tech 2 recon they have a fleet of faction ships waiting. it's impossible to defend yourself because there is no element of surprise. at least if they don't know you're coming you may stand somewhat of a chance.it is entirely possible to link accounts based on whoever is paying it and whoever supplied their contact info for the account. you just have to carry that link into the game.
6/9/2010,"first off your completely missing the point.secondly... did you realize that the ""spies"" your talking about are usually the ones in your corporation?duh?time for you to walk away... your wasting your time.you have no concept of war-decs... you barely understand the mechanics... asking ccp to change it to the way you suggested it would completely unbalance a already broken mechanic.we're done here... i'm not feeding this troll anymore."
6/9/2010,"yeah i think you're just mad cause you've used an alt for similar reasons yourself.this would solve the problem of spies in a corp as well unless someone wants to tarnish their ingame persona (which is not just one alt but all of their alts). the entire point of ccp not allowing a player to change their name is to show that what you do in the game sticks with you. i'm just trying to carry that to having alts as well. your behavior in the game should reflect how all of your alts are treated. seems simple enough. honestly the only people that would have a problem with this are those that have cheated people in the game. those that skip off to an alt why they war dec someone else. those that form random fleets of random corps to attack a corp in null sec that has a nrds policy. if you want to be a spy then by all means be one...i'm just saying that if eve is supposed to be like real life you shouldn't be able to pull the same trick twice. you shouldn't be able to declare war on someone and then choose your battles based entirely on the fact that you always know what the enemy has at all times. spies, eyes, corp hopping alts designed to not be targets to nrds corps...i'm not sure why you're getting all emotional about this. i'm making a suggestion that makes perfect sense."
6/9/2010,"here's the thing, ccp only responds to unimportant issues. anything that needs fixing (like destroyer) can go ignored for years."
6/9/2010,a friendly amendment. please allow us to turn off the sound in *all* stations.
6/9/2010,"need i say more? how stupid is it that i find customs offices with references to amarr law in ""unknown"" space? ""excerpt from the amarr prime customs agency regulations, section 17, subsection 4, paragraph 8: ... "" and so on.. this was found in j112129 . there are no less than 6 customs offices in here. if you intend to keep them in there ccp, i'd like to buy bookmarks to the various wormholes from since obviously npcs have scanned them all down and are busy doing business in there. could save me a bit of work that. -bad"
6/9/2010,"yes, internet spaceships must make perfect sense."
6/9/2010,picture proof please?
6/9/2010,why the hell are there custom offices in unknown space?
6/9/2010,explain how bombs will crash the node? :s
6/9/2010,"launch bomb, cloak, win. death to jita."
6/9/2010,great idea.the ui needs to do a better job at providing feedback to the pilot on the status of their ship.
6/9/2010,"i was bored.(edit: forgot the tick.)to explain the design, i stuck to the current theme, minus the centre of the buttons being opaque. mostly it's aimed at better visibility (see the bottom row to see the visibility being tested), and much broader visual differentiation between different states. there's no overheat button, though, as clicking with both mouse buttons or holding a modifier key instead would mostly eliminate accidentally overheating a module.i just noticed i forgot the overheating-but-not-next-cycle one. it's centre is the same as the overheating button, with the green blinking active halo."
6/9/2010,supported. if the overload option was in the middle of the module icon but was given more surface space so it can be clicked without deactivating the module may help.
6/9/2010,and a hot-key combo plz
6/9/2010,still supporting this.in a game like eve having to rely on self made lists of people to avoid buying stuff from is a little irritating.ccp: move the blocks client side so we can block anyone or everyone if we want. you mean min/max? it does not work in this way. if you put any non-zero number in the min box then it removes all want to buy contracts. even changing this would be good.
6/9/2010,"she is talking about the 0.0 infrastructure upgrades and how the info(or lack of it) about them is shown, but isn't describing what she means very well."
6/9/2010,likely living up to namesake hersch. (that only applies to nooblet op... no offense to other gals in this thread (and yes there's at least one watching this thread for sure)
6/9/2010,"hello, mr. smartguy. i vote to have this troll thread filtered."
6/9/2010,"i was thinking about something much less dramatic than replacing csm with a forum poll. and, no - this is not a troll.for example, assembly hall is full of threads from people who want their side of the game boosted and also nerf everything else that they are not using - be it a ship, play style or something else in the game. when you look at some nonsense of a topic you simply know that the original poster is just trolling, whining or just don't understand how the game works. i don't see how that kind of ideas are constructive and relevant to the csm.examples of some topics that will never get even 5% of positive comments:- defensive ecm bursts in high-sec- make highsec wars in .8-1.0 sec mutual- an idea on how to eliminate power blocks- pay plex to double training speed- missions to get out of wardecs... and more... just browse the recent topicsnow, i would love to hear how are these topics constructive or in any way relevant to csm?"
6/9/2010,"the first thread you mentioned (ecm bursts) actually has some merit, although cannot be supported in its current form. the rest are crap though."
6/9/2010,"it's simple. fix r.a.m. if it needs to be 200 units, then remove the damage and adjust r.a.m. blueprint accordingly."
6/9/2010,ankh's number one priority is not the csm. it is ankh.
6/9/2010,"casiella,you may well be right. still, a gentle caution not to jump the gun here. most of the csm represents a narrow range of special interests, mynxee acknowledges an anti-ank sentiment, and we've little idea of the neutrality (i.e. absence of political bias) of these meeting notes. most of us have seen these dynamics in other public, private or non-profit spheres. no surprise there. setting up a separate issues-wiki may indeed be a mistake, or it may be a smart move to avoid politicized bickering and scape-goating. so lets see what happens here, and hold *all* the members of the csm accountable for collaborating, doing a good job, and representing the interests of the *entire* eve community. delilah"
6/9/2010,"not in those minutes. she acknowledged disagreeing with ankh on some issues. there is a rather large difference. since i'm a helpful alt troll, here are the raw logs for the first meeting. and here are the raw logs for the second. hope that helps!oh, and come back when you have a clue what you're talking about."
6/9/2010,"thanks for linking these threads. it will make it easier for folks to follow what is going on. at the same time, please consider that my thoughts on special interests, sentiments, and neutrality are not dependent on one set of minutes. i think you'll find it useful both in and out of eve to consider alternative meanings to words and actions before firing off a hostile response. delilah"
6/9/2010,"oh hey, look, it's someone who doesn't get the difference between 'i disagree with you' and 'i am automatically opposed to everything you stand for. furthermore, ****s****s****s, rabble rabble.'also lawling at ankh: two meetings, two paranoid meltdowns. awesome."
6/9/2010,"to be fair, the fact that mynxee appears to be the former and not the latter is making me reconsider my vote for her."
6/9/2010,i guess and evil griefers that like pvp hold a grudge eh?reap what you sow.
6/9/2010,"no, delilah is quite right. from the minutes linked above: mynxee didn't say she disliked ankh, but acknowledged that the sentiment exists. we do need to see how things play out, since the term just began and we have 12 months to go."
6/9/2010,ignore this... i can;t find a delete button.
6/9/2010,"ok, thanks for the information. :)"
6/9/2010,no worries.for the record i've hassled them again today. i'd like to get it sorted
6/9/2010,"it'd be nice to know - else i'll have to convince mynxee to give linux a go so she can see the pros and cons of using it herself.i'd like someone to champion the relativity simple (and not so labour intensive)request of having the windows client compiled using wine (unix windows comparability layer) libraries. in order for the client to be made available from the official site.i know from the tone of the devblogs that ccp does not really want to alienate this rugged, proud and independent community so very similar in character to themselves."
6/9/2010,"i'd rather have ccp use resources on fixing stuff, than catering for an os with less than stellar performance in games."
6/9/2010,"you know what - you're right. what was i thinking?linux runs eve (with a bit of encouragement), how stellar can you get?"
6/9/2010,"i believe eve did have a linux client at one point, but it was abandoned since wine was easier to set up, and was giving a better experience to boot. i think they've since said that they'd rather work on improving the windows client's compatibility with wine, than maintain 3 separate client bases."
6/9/2010,"good luck, looks like a pretty decent group this go around too =)"
6/9/2010,"to the csm,i read that there was only a 12% turnout for voting from the eve player base! would it not be ideal to make a request to ccp to possibly add vote beacons in certain areas of the eve universe. e.g. new player hubs, market hubs.a pilot warps to the vote beacon, activates it and then they are presented with a selection list (each selection also links to a url for the csm candidate)."
6/9/2010,improving csm visibility is always something we work on :) i'm sure we'll talk about it with xhagen and diagoras when we are in iceland.
6/9/2010,"might not seem like much, but it was nearly double the previous election. there was a lot more blogging, tweeting, and forum discussion (on this and other forums) this time around and i noticed ccp gave csm events more splash screen notices, dev blogs, etc. the trick is going to be to maintain that momentum and build on it with each election. responsibility for that is shared by candidates, ccp, and the community. the other key is building csm credibility. that can only be done by showing results, which means proposed features/changes/ideas actually implemented rather than disappeared into the backlog. we can invest many, many hours of time discussing, analyzing, and recommending (and believe me, we do spend those hours) but unless there is a result to point at and say ""that got done because of our work with ccp"", the players will remain skeptical of csm's effectiveness. can hardly blame them. hopefully, our status as stakeholders will give us more influence over priorities going forward. ccp has some responsibility for highlighting tangible cms accomlishments, as well, if they want to stop getting **** from players about csm being a worthless exercise in marketing. for example, every set of patch notes should have ""csm"" labels next to the items that csm championed. if there are not at least several of those on every expansion's patch notes, then houston, we have a problem."
6/9/2010,"even having a vote icon under station management for when csm elections come round would be another option.reminding players of the csm is lost as soon as the player logs in to eve, you may have the news banner on the right of the screen when you select your character or the information banner above the log-in box. once you are past those screens; anything to do with the csm is lost and forgotten about and that is a shame.another option would be for ccp to allow csm candidates to produce an eve-mail that can be sent to all active players. this is one way for the candidates to canvas the user base."
6/9/2010,"i believe i had notified mynx that i wouldn't be able to be there but apparently i didn't, apologies."
6/9/2010,"i completely agree with this initiative. raising csm credibility and especially visibility will be key. when i ran for csm4, i got a lot of blank stares from pilots that didn't know what the csm was, let alone the impact they can have on the game. by accomplishing this goal and gaining a higher visibility, the csm will gain more leverage with ccp in completing the implementations that it initiates. ahs"

6/10/2010,hello
6/10/2010,supporting the lego-like station idea.
6/10/2010,"you're skipping over solutions to chase a ""big idea"".you say that plex pvp only happens around downtime.this is true. thus the solution to your timezone not enjoying plex in the same way is to fix the broken spawning mechanic.you say that npcs unbalance the plex.this is true. it is their ewar that is unbalanced and it needs to be removed from all navy npcs.both these issues have been known for a long time and ccp has taken no action.these major changes aren't needed, just 2 very simple broken things that have been known about since day 1 need to be fixed."
6/10/2010,"even though i already cancelled all my accounts, i support this. i hope ccp gets their act together, until then i'll look for my gaming fix somewhere else.tyrannis is a pot s*** and not worthy of being called an expansion."
6/10/2010,"i agree with this 100%ccp needs to finish on, and continue to improve on expansions. and stop this policy of rushing features out the door half baked, and then dropping them to work on the next new thing.i also would like to see a more open bug tracking and reporting process. maybe an open list of known bugs, possibly with some type of priority level to be fixed?players could submit new bugs, or add information to an already existing case. players could also try and say how sever the issue is for them, so ccp could prioritize and fix the bugs that are most important to players first?"
6/10/2010,just another thumbs up to add to the ball.
6/10/2010,"of course i'm supporting, but i doubt ccp will ever really shift their focus. i've just about had it with ccp's bait-and-switch routine."
6/10/2010,"support, of course."
6/10/2010,supported!
6/10/2010,"maybe in your reality, but not in ours - at best 10-20% of the effort was on code repair. imo tyrannis was 70% pi and 20% meaningless ui changes and no amount of spin will change that. sure, there were bug fixes, but nearly all were minor bugs hardly anyone cared about! meanwhile we're still playing this broken game year after year, because there's nothing better out there in the same vein. but the minute there is...? the clock starts ticking for ccp. in fact, i'm pretty sure it already is. there's way too many professional programmers and such in this game, and they know people who know people.."

6/10/2010,fully agree!
6/10/2010,"i fully and wholeheartedly support this, and hope ccp reads it and responds to it in some manner, if nothing else."
6/10/2010,"i think that if they made the next expansion one that focuses on expanding, thereby finishing, what's already present, then about 60% of the problems are gone. they would have to find some way to make it more marketable than just ""hey, we fixed some broken features"" but you get the idea. perhaps have two expansions a year: one focusing on new material, the other to expand, and improve, existing material in the 6 month intervals they have going.personally i think the reason behind the big push of new materials is to try and keep people playing eve when star trek online comes out. i love eve and have no intention of jumping ship, but that's not to say others wont.supported :d"
6/10/2010,"i strongly encourage this, and as along-time player i certainly do hope ccp does what's been suggested here."
6/10/2010,i'm a bit concerned about the way things are turning out regarding the recently released expansions...full support!
6/10/2010,this thread appeals to my interests.
6/10/2010,full support from me. we don't need new stuff we want the stuff that was promised but under delivered!

6/10/2010,"absolutely supported. ccp have made a great game. polish up the existing, don't leave half finished bits hanging."
6/10/2010,"supported, ccp said themselves that 6 months isn't even enough time for the csm to do anything worthwhile, thus extending into a 12 month period, how do you expect to full on create a brand new patch of gaming software of this magnitude in 6 months when it's claimed that you can't even talk about it effectively in that time"

6/10/2010,+1there has been no excellence in ccp for a long while now; it always annoyed me that they think we somehow don't see through the shiny pr job.don't take us for cretins and do what you say you will for a change.

6/10/2010,"yes please. new content can be based on previous content. while ccp feel they need new content to keep current subscribers, making current content easier to use (ie ui updates) or adding challenges (ie improve fw) will make the game more complete."
6/10/2010,"please take heed, fw (among other features) needs halp!"
6/10/2010,obviously - adjustable font size should be standard - especially for higher resolutions.
6/10/2010,yes please!
6/10/2010,it needs to be scalable to a minimum of 18pt plus being able to choose a serif font if desired.
6/10/2010,"for the love of all that is holy, yes. god please yes."
6/10/2010,bump for the new csm ... who do i have to sleep with to push this through ?(looks at mynxee)
6/10/2010,this ****ing **** has been put off way to long.
6/10/2010,"yes. at least two mid and two low slots for all destroyers. boost grid to allow for a full complement of any small guns or missiles and all but the hungriest modules. its a destroyer - it should be almost as fast as a frig, slightly tougher and loaded for bear!"
6/10/2010,"as per trebor daehdoow's request, since there are a few basic problems with pi i'm going to gather them in this thread. if i miss anything please post and i'll edit it in when i have a chance.1. upgradeable command centers- we should be able to upgrade these things from a cc in our cargo hold without destroying the whole network.2. useless storage facilities- they serve no purpose that is not better carried out elsewhere, in addition they seem to me to be resource heavy in terms of cpu and pg as compared to what it offers.3. the ""view planet"" button in selected item window needs to be moved-it's placement makes very little sense to me in the first place, but more importantly having it right next to the warp button which is often mashed franticly in an effort to escape is just stupid and dangerous.4. canceling an extraction job before the timer finishes- it'd make sense if we could stop it without ripping out the extractor.(tentative) 5. some systems in 0.0 space are off limits for pi for the sov holder of that space. -it'd be nice to know why-if its a bug it'd be nice to eliminate it6. allow storage to route to one another7. make it possible to downgrade links- because otherwise you have to rip them out and reroute everything8. the customs office should be given an ""access customer office"" button in the selected item window- ""i find it strange that i have to right click it. you can't target it so if necessary, replace that button.""9. make routed materials behave in a more sensible manner with certain options given precedent over others.- if there is an option to ill a factory buffer or a factory with more room before it can cycle send it to the one that can cycle- if the above isn't and option send materials to the factory with the most stuff in it's buffer.- per delcats thread: make materials route from the storage that is most full firstalso maybe something to tell you if a planet has offline extractors from the science and industry tab? or at any rate without having to go down to the planet and look? it's kind of minor so maybe not. btw for anyone unaware lings can be created by ctrl click on building then clicking on where you want to link to and double clicking on extractors will automatically cause them to survey.delta bacat's thread:anything in this thread should be seriously considered (i probably wouldn't have started this if i saw this before)."
6/10/2010,"taken from delta bacat's thread:(that was all i could fit, some are already in the op so i got rid of a couple to make room)if you think anymore of these belong in the op just let me know."
6/10/2010,"1, 3, and 4 i agree with. 2 i think has a better solution - make storage facilities and spaceports upgradeable like links(though with a different scale - each upgrade costs exactly as much fitting/isk as a storage facility and gives you exactly as much space). that way you can avoid stupid routing problems from having multiple storage facilities, without getting any sort of advantage to doing it one way or the other. and 5 i don't think is actually a problem - every expansion has profit sources for the people who are paying attention, and the scale of it is small enough that it doesn't bother me. it'll go away soon enough. still, supported in general."
6/10/2010,my largest problem with pi is that specific 0.0 systems that are player sov are not usable in pi because ccp says so. you can't even view the planets. h-w is an example. toss that in there and i will gladly support this :)
6/10/2010,"i don't think he meant, that the storage needs to be increased to have less warehouses in the network, but instead decrease the cpu and pg-requirements of warehouses, which i'd fully support. they're just too demanding for a simple building that does nothing but beeing mainly big and hollow."
6/10/2010,"yeah i was referring to the cpu and more importantly pw demands. i think ccp need to spend a little more time invested in balancing those two things in genreal anyways, but it's especially egregious with storage facilities.i'm not sure to what you are referring here. are you saying that you are part of the sov holder in that region but that some planets are still off limits? or that you can't place pi in other peoples sov?if the former you should note thet there are some high-sec planets unavailable as well, it could have rp or other purposes which we arn't aware of."
6/10/2010,sov holder where entire systems are unusable despite the fact we hold sov. this is most definitely not ccp's response to me asking why as i would never post a gm response we are the native faction. we did not request this. if they are referring to gurista's i call bull**** ^_^
6/10/2010,the other thread (in f&i) that jin mentions is here.
6/10/2010,"that seems really odd. but at the same time i'm hesitant to include it because i was looking at more basic fixes and it seems to be intended. same thing with having customs offices in wh or 0.0, its kinda of dumb but it gets the job done. i'll mark it tentative."
6/10/2010,"oh, that. the reasoning behind that is simple. they want pi to be something you can't afk usefully. it's designed to force people to deal with it daily, and if you could have useful amounts of storage then you might not need to move goods around every few days. it was specifically intended to promote terrible gameplay. i don't like it, but it won't change."
6/10/2010,"my apoligies if i'm posting in the wrong area but this looked like the best fit.suggestion for pi improvement: allow players to logically remove power and cpu from existing structures and links. removing power and cpu costs nothing while bringing things back on line takes isk. by logically i mean if a mid link or structure is deactivated, everything tied in upstream is also deactivated.i'm guessing most players are extracting several materials at once and this would allow a more efficient use of factories and extractors. as the market shifts production can be ramped up or decreased."
6/10/2010,"agreed. also, i would like to add 2 points:6. could the customs office be given an ""access customer office"" button in the selected item window? i find it strange that i have to right click it. you can't target it so if necessary, replace that button.7. on the planets tab of science and industry, either could the ""view planet"" button of the screen be moved closer to the minimise button, or better still, minimise the dialog when pressed?"

6/10/2010,i feel this would also be a minor boost to losec as mission runners can align to a good safe inside the mission

6/10/2010,"you obviously have no idea what you are talking about. you say yourself arties got other advantages - damage switching, tracking-boosting ammo, no cap usaged which is for sure a major advantage. and yet their ships do more dps in general, tempest has 2 dmg bonuses, maelstrom has rof bonus, which give more dps than damage bonus, so minmatar ships do more damage in general. on the other hand amarr' primary beam users got range bonuses(apoc, zealot) and still a lot greater dps, alpha(for apoc) and tracking than gallente ships.and if you were ever involved in some medium and even large scale fighting, which i really doubt, you would've know that alpha strike is as important as dps and doing 4 times the alpha of another weapons platform is gonna be better than doing like 5% more dps in most cases.where did you ever get that idea? they're nothing at all like half-laser, half-projectile weapons.you are wrong, hybrids are called that as they are both projectile and energy weapons, as the projectile itself is meant to create a field of extremely hot plasma around it, much to the same effect as laser weapons in addition to the initial massive kinetic force.i've been flying amarr for more than an year now and about half an year in minmatar ships, so you're kinda wrong."
6/10/2010,can we keep all our support behind 1 topic instead of multiple ones?
6/10/2010,"oh god not another ""hybrid"" thread.unfortunatly your blaster suggestion is poor. moar range is not what blasters need. its the last thing they need.i agree that hybrids do need to be rebalanced with the other weapons systems out there but just simple damage boosts are not going to cut it. the biggest problem with balancing hybrids comes from the fact that two races with very diferent combat philosophies use them.also the thing about alpha being ""king"" in sniper fleet fights is a bigger problem with gameplay than weapons systems. there are some combat changing suggestions being bounced around at the minute to look into this issue.one of them is here"
6/10/2010,"blasters need a dps/tracking buff not a range buff, but that would be nice, and buffing rail dps between arty and lasers would be nice, and do to the 250km range cap an apoc can match a rokh in range and deal more dps.ps:for rails this is going in the right direction."
6/10/2010,"1k dps blaster brutix does not need more dps. it does not need more of anything. whatever happened to buffing prophecy, cyclone, and such ships that suck by design?"
6/10/2010,and why shouldn't we double blaster optimal?.........please visit your user settings to re-enable images.40km blaster optimal!!!!!!! thats 840 dps out to 40km + 20km fall off. edit.....oh for gods sake the image won't show up!!
6/10/2010,i wouldn't care if i got less isk for mission running if the op's ideas where incorporated. fun > isk
6/10/2010,yet another ankh idea i've thought about myself. it wouldn't matter if it was just a couple random branches or a diablo-style randomized dungeon..it would make things a lot more interesting. but the likelihood of ccp even considering this idea is probably less than zero (like pretty much every good idea their presented with).
6/10/2010,"the main reason i hate pve is because it is unchallenging, repetitive and makes me wish i was lobotomized after doing 2 of them. at least make them fun or suprising, anything better then what it is now...an overhaul of the pve system is long overdue"
6/10/2010,this gets my vote a million times. i believe ccp wants us to interact with each others. providing people with a common (worthy) enemy is a great deal more effective than setting up everyone versus everyone and be like lets go kill something!this dynamic system will ad palpable value to eve. hey what do i know? the harassing whines might stop (at least a little) and people just might start getting things done together...
6/10/2010,"this project describes something similar to what i've been thinking (for several years now!) is missing in eve's pve.i support this, and would like to see it ported to all pve, that is missions, complexes, sleeper sites (those have the same issues, despite the 'improved' ai - which i deem barely acceptable - ), and even occasional belt rat spawns."
6/10/2010,"then why else would u possibly make ******ed excuses to nerf suicide ganking? as u said, ""it's your problem so deal with it"". no, that's what self-destruct is for... do u know why it's called ""suicide ganking""? it's 'cause it's the intention to destroy the target--gotta have a target to be a gank, moron. the payment is part of the deal because...1.""normal"" eve insurance is buying insurance to compensate u for ship loss as long as u didn't repackage it or someone else boards it. period. the selected item will be insured while in your possession for the duration of the contract. repackaging the item will void the contract. the contract will be considered void if the item or ship is destroyed while being in the possession of somebody else. do you accept the above terms and still want to insure the selected item?point out where it says otherwise.2. semantics with risk/consequences aka 100% risk. seriously, what's so special about 100% that it's somehow the only magic number to void insurance by? how would 99% or even 98% probability of destruction by endangering a ship in any way to bring about certain destruction qualify as not being insurance fraud? it's still high enough for an insurance payout to be certain so why should the insurance company pay up? because there's a slim chance u could've failed in committing insurance fraud? your whole post is as ******ed as u r simply because u're trying to tie guaranteed concord-related ship loss with the sole intention of destroying one's own ship just for payment, when even a slightly less 99% chance of loss is somehow not insurance fraud to u. epic fail.there's no difference at all as explained by the above. and technically, suicide ganking is pvp. it's just nonconsensual, like regular ganking and blobbing, fyi.all u've done is attempt to separate suicide ganking from every other form of pvp and cry about it, just like the others that want someone else to hold their hand when they want high sec to be 100% safe. like u said, it's yours/their problem--deal with it.or u can keep coming up with other flimsy excuses, modified logic, and any other brand new ways to fail...so what else u got?"
6/10/2010,*double-post from editing*
6/10/2010,"i didn't read through all of that wall of text. but just to repeat again:when you destroy the ship to collect insurance fees, it's insurance fraud. when you try to keep the ship alive to the best of your abilities, and thus, trying to prevent yourself from collecting insurance, it's eve pvp.in the first case, you have a conflict of interest that runs counter to insurance. in the 2nd, your interest align with the insurance.ask for specifics if there's anything you still don't understand."

6/10/2010,"supported. when ganking industrials with billions of cargo, or pimpboats with billions of deadspace mods, cost of a gank phoon is chump change. insurance fraud need a gimp. suicide ganking does not need to be cost-free. everything in eve cost isks, so swallow it and htfu. this whinning is getting old."
6/10/2010,"more like u ignored it 'cause it actually refuted your sorry excuse of an argument, troll... first of all, u're not destroying the ship just to collect insurance--like i said before, u're taking out the target via suicide gank--gotta have a target to be a gank, moron. but by your logic, sending a ship into a losing battle is also insurance fraud since it's a ""100% chance of destruction"". and trying to warp out before concord arrives or the blob tackles u is technically trying to keep the ship alive to the best of your abilities and preventing insurance, despite the fact u're gonna get blown up in either case. second, the insurance contract says nothing relating to how insurance is collected--try reading it sometime so maybe u wouldn't have to continue hiding in your ignorance. lmfao t1 insurance already got nerfed but of course, u're too ignorant to realize it. funny how the ignorant and stupid carebear tries to act all hard when he's the one crying so much and not even attempting to htfu and adapt... eve does not cater to stupidity, so u're a moron if u still expect ccp to hold your hand after all this time.then again, is this post too ""long"" for u or is it too ""true""? 'cause maybe the truth hurts so much that u're just gonna continue ignoring my arguments and continue repeating yourself..."
6/10/2010,"...and you resort to name calling instead of trying to understand the difference.eve insurance is a game mechanic device to make pvp viable. it's purpose is not to earn npc money. it's not a matter of margins, but of principle, as it's never intended to make npc money.let me repeat again. when you destroy your own ship with intent to collect insurance, it's insurance fraud. when you try to keep your ship alive, but sometimes fail, and ended up collecting insurance, it's pvp. in one case, you try to collect, in the other, you try to not collect. the alignment of interests is in opposite directions. this difference of principle is black and white."

6/10/2010,"there is no difference, moron, only u fail/refuse to understand that. suicide ganking is still pvp, just like regular ganking and blobbing, so that's why insurance covers it as well.let me repeat again. u're not destroying your ship via self-destruct, concord is. your intent is destroying the target. and warping away to attempt to evade concord is trying to keep the ship alive too but why should that alone should qualify for insurance when it has nothing to do with the insurance contract:the selected item will be insured while in your possession for the duration of the contract. repackaging the item will void the contract. the contract will be considered void if the item or ship is destroyed while being in the possession of somebody else. do you accept the above terms and still want to insure the selected item?is any of this getting through to u? probably not..."

6/10/2010,"well if he wasn't such a moron, he wouldn't be wasting his breath if he didn't repeat the same stupid **** so many times simply because he was so blissfully ignorant of the responses to his posts. and once again, upon reading the contract, it's no loophole 'cause i didn't repackage it nor did i let someone else board it, which were the only conditions. what possible loophole can there be in such a brief contract? remember, it's not real money and it's not real life..."

6/10/2010,"i'm sure there is a whole package of tweaks we'd like to see in pi. for example, the current routing algorithm is appears to be static; after you change the network of links, the routes do not seem to recompute to spread the load over all the available paths, and you have to manually re-route things. it would be nice if this was done automatically.if people could post their pi wish-lists in this thread (and gather them from other threads, please, pretty please with sugar on it), we can discuss them here and i'll work up a csm submission."

6/10/2010,"note: this is in no way a gripe or a whine against ninja salvages/can tippers or anyone who enjoys using such mechanics to there advantage. i'm not here to buff or nerf... this is strictly about the aggression counter. so if your here to flame me then please do stfu and move along. have a nice day and enjoy your complimentary cookie for reading this.some time ago i was enjoying a level 4 with my corp mates when we got visited by a tech 1 frigate who was intent on pilfering our hard earned work. yes yes i'm aware of all that bullcrap about it not being our property and what not... i'm not here to debate. point is we where intent on claiming that as our own so i locked him up and made it clear i was intending to make my point clear... he went blinky and then i opened up on his shiny little rear end and sent him screaming away.now at this point most noobs fall prey to the ""gank"" that takes place when he goes to get a bigger ship... not intending to repeat history i ordered my fleet to warp off to some deep space and sat there for about 10 minutes. the aggression counter was ticking down predictably at 15 minutes so i knew i was going to be free-for-all to him and his corp if applicable.eventually i docked up and sat there... you undock with said counter it warns you that your in a nasty situation that may involve you getting shot at. i moved my mouse cursor over the timer and could see there was 2 timers. one was the standard and there was an ""unkown"" (classic eve glitch eh?).i waited until the timer finished... no more pop up window. i waited an another 5 to 10 minutes and then went back to finish my mission.only to see a tengu warp in and light my ass up. (ouch)now... let me clear something up.1: aggression counter is gone... nada... zip... plus 10 minutes since that point.2: i didn't shoot the tengu as i was busy killing something else.3: drones where stowed... didn't need them at the time.everyone i spoke too tells me that he should have been concord'd (would have been a classic epic fail moment to be sure). but instead he was able to shoot me without restraint.i petitioned this... not for my ship mind you... but for clarifcation if not indicating a problem.i was told (paraphrased) that they are aware of the ""problem"" and its a legitimate mechanic. that pilots can shoot wrecks to extend the aggression timer at-will to keep said victim free to open fire on.now i'd be first to call that an exploit... because there is no indication of such a thing taking place.however... i admit this is a legitimate (albeit nasty and disgusting) profession and i cannot on good conscience as a participant of these boards scream/cry/whine about it.my problem is that there was no timer. what-so-ever.what is the point of having an aggression timer that doesn't show up when being extended?everything i've read... researched... discussed... even pilots who do this for fun (gank baiting via ninja salvaging) have told me that the 15 min timer is the golden rule/standard. if i didn't encourage more aggression... and there's no timer.he should have been concord'd.*continued on next post..."
6/10/2010,"that said... i propose the following be done:1: aggression timer gets updated/fixed/patched to indicate any changes or extensions of that timer in any form or fashion to indicate to you that your able to get shot at.2: aggression timer is yanked out and removed entirely as at this point there is no relevant reason to keep something that is completely useless and broken.3: remove the exploitive nature of extending a timer by shooting wrecks/cans when no notice is given to owner. thereby going back to the standard 15 minute rules so to speak. and in all honesty that timer should be extended by the one that shoots back... not the one that does the ninja salvaging/can tipping. but that's a messy business.pros/cons:1: no changes to mechanic other than the pilot who shot at ninja salvager is aware that ninja salvager can shoot back. no cons.2: pros: ninja salvagers and can tippers get an unspecified amount of time and its a guessing game. cons: its a guessing game for everyone.3: pros: ninja salvagers can't exploit the system by extending the time to shoot back... 15 minutes is all you get. cons: depends on your perspective. but 15 minutes is an awful lot of time to respond for crying out loud.personally i prefer 1. keeps balance and no one loses anything other than knowledge that the situation is getting extended.again... i knew what i was getting into and i have no qualms about what took place.but i was told... understood... aggression timer means ""you can get shot at"".no aggression counter means i'm safe for the most part. invisible aggression counter is bad... stupid.so yeah... flame away and make with the whining. x)and i feel its unbalanced."
6/10/2010,i agree that either the timer should be fixed (optimal) or removed (viable) since having a broken mechanic designed to level the playing that can be exploited so easily in a way that makes it unbalanced is absurd. the fact that ccp knows about this issue but chooses not to fix it in some way is infuriating. the timer is there to tell you that you are in combat and at risk. if the timer is there you should be at risk. if the timer is not there you should be safe. i acknowledge the fun of ninja salvaging (i've done it myself) but even i think this is insanely unfair to the people who think they're fine only to be blasted to bits due to a broken mechanic. i support any of the mentioned remedies preferably fixing the timer or removing the ability to extend the timer.
6/10/2010,"insist on escalating your petition. if it really was like you said, then it's a first-class exploit.so just to clear it up: he shoots your wrecks and your agression-timer gets an extension? that's just rediculous."
6/10/2010,"here's how this exploit (and it is a blatant exploit ccp has made no pains to eliminate) works:get aggro from target in mission/mining area. aggro party leaves to safe or dock up.return and find a wreck or jetcan and plink it every 30 seconds, just make sure it doesn't pop. a scram works well for this.this will maintain aggression for up to 30 minutes (this was the longest duration i could be arsed to confirm) after the victim's timer has lapsed, if not longer.victim thinks they're clear and returns to the mission/mining area to be happily bbqd.corp mate lost an orca to this exploit (docked for 30 minutes after initial aggro, undocked and got pwnt), but ccp said it was not a reimbursable loss.this hole needs to be patched."
6/10/2010,"legitimate my ass. that's just broken. how blind do you have to be, to see that as 'working as intended'?"
6/10/2010,bingo.honestly the bit about extending the aggression timer isn't my beef... its the lack of an aggression timer period.however... i admit its rather exploitative as far as how you highlighted it.
6/10/2010,"modal popup dialogs are a terrible ui choice in any game that can't be paused, especially one like eve where the death penalty is so high. no dialog that pops up should ever be modal, period. frankly there is no reason for these to exist at all, it's only more bad coding and design on ccp's part. if some other element of the ui needs to be locked down, fine, but locking down the entire game is simply unacceptable. i'm sure this has already been brought up, but seriously the csm should push this."

6/10/2010,"so recently i had a deja vu moment and thought i updated my clone, when in reality it was prior to my last death. this caused me to lose over a month of training, which brought much frustration and prompted the question what benifit does this bring to the game? and does the benifit if any outweigh the frustration and loss of players as i'm sure people have quit over this before. it's easy to say up on your high horse if you've never forgot to update ""your an idiot live and learn"" but in reality it is an honest, and simple mistake anyone could make. it is in my opinion this brings more frustration and hardship to the game than enjoyment, a suitable death penalty is already in place with loss of ship/implants and clone costs, why is the simple act of forgetting to update take it to such a higher level? for this reason i am proposing the addition of a 1 limit back-up clone in the game that might only be able to be put in 1 selected station, and is difficult to obtain either through cost or something like a special mission. once obtained it stays there and is only activated if you regular clone cannot cover the the skill points. this still provides incentive to update with the difficulty of obtaining and renewing the backup clone if it is activated, but lessens the severity of fist pounding and broken monitors im sure many players have gone through without even providing enjoyment to others.(if it did provide enjoyment to others somehow i wouldnt be proposing this, but whoever kills you doesnt even realize you didnt have an updated clone for the satisfaction, yes eve is cold hearted and should stay that way )it's my belief this would enhance the overall experience of eve, not degrade it, looking forward to your responses, but please no one on there high horse posting ""you're an idiot learn to update"", actually evaluate the pros/cons the current system and the proposed system have, thanks!"
6/10/2010,"as someone who made that mistake once i say ""you screwed up, learn from it.""i play eve instead of other mmo's just for the fact there is risk associated with screwing up.if you screw up, eve will punish you, through loss of ship, loss of isk or even loss of sp.if you don't like being penalized for dying, either don't die, or find a game that doesn't have a penalty for it - they are out there.....i like my mistresses harsh, cold, and pretty - probably why i play eve."
6/10/2010,"i agree the extra risk in eve should stay, and should stay as cold-hearted and as cut throat as it is, but you failed to list the benifits this gives to the game, risking expensive ships gives you excitement, and enjoyment and objective to those trying to take you out, this isn't the case for sp loss. can you think of any benifits like the rest of the risk in eve carries?"
6/10/2010,"you screwed up (by your own admission), and now all of eve needs to change to protect you from your own forgetfullness......i want to know why a mechanic the rest of of us have adapted to as a natural consequence of foolishness (or forgetfullness) has to be changed just because now it affected you.by the way, thank you for bringing the topic up, my clone was 2 grades out of date and i'm heading to wormhole space tommorow - that could have sucked."
6/10/2010,"i don't want to argue, it's fine that you don't support this but i would like to point out i don't think you answered the question of the benifits of the current system over the proposed system, reguardless of this petitions outcome i will not recieve my sp back, so this isn't about me screwing up. i posted here because i genuinely believe this proposal or something similar like an option to automatically update and remove the isk from your wallet when you die would benifit eve by lowering frustration while not sacrificing any enjoyment. lets keep the discussion to the pros/cons of this idea please."
6/10/2010,"thats my issue right there, being a sitting duck in a pve fit because my agent tosses me low sec missions, which due to changes in tyrannis happens more often than getting a high sec mission. taking a standing hit by declining 3 missions so i don't have to go low sec isn't an acceptable solution for a mission runner. if the agent is in high sec space and giving out low sec missions, you shouldn't have to take a standing hit, or take a very small one, to decline the low sec missions."
6/10/2010,i'll be in turnur. :)-liang
6/10/2010,want a better solution? remove missions from empire or low sec.
6/10/2010,"man, you're pretty insightful these days!-liang"
6/10/2010,it would definitely fix the problem. can't argue that.
6/10/2010,"2 minutes? what is with this misconception lowsec is packed with pirates waiting to kill you?i've been running plexes in a drake in lowsec, followed expeditions and taken deadspace loot back to highsec and most locals never bothered to scan for me if there even was anyone there.i lost 2 or 3 drakes in half a year and got billions in loot."
6/10/2010,most empire carebears seem to have this huge misconception that low sec is filled to the brim with probing gatecamping pirates in every system just waiting for an unsuspecting victim to jump in. they are of course wrong because low sec is largely empty but good luck convincing them of that.
6/10/2010,"what they aren't wrong about is that a pirate will likely visit them through the course of the night. we roam pretty far and wide trying to find anything moving, and many of us take scan probe launchers on the roams... really just watch d-scan when there's someone in local with you, but even still the sad truth is that most agents in low sec really aren't worth bothering with over a much better agent in high sec.-lianged: btw, carebears stay away from my agents that i worked hard to secure! i want to carebear in peace with my 13 billion isk pve ship in low sec!"
6/10/2010,not supported

6/10/2010,"if you want to be a pirate, be prepared to pay all costs.my pirate has only been attacked by a single player with kill rights, unsuccessfully (and they attacked me with an orca, of all things! *lol* while i was missioning with a tengu. thanks for the deadspace fit gila, sorry about the hulk. )."
6/10/2010,"just throwing ideas here about make low sec better and probably making people go in there more often than high-sec. i also realise that this kind of post as being posted but another one can't hurthere are some facts first. theres lots of mission runners in high-sec, lots of people in high-sec (too much if you ask me), rewards in low sec is not substantial when compared to high-sec. null sec rewards are substantial compared to low-secproblem: low-sec is empty:reason: 1. its not rewarding enough for missions. about the same bounties and rewards2. exploration gives about the same payout, rewards to high-sec...3. when you engage someone in low-sec you lose security status which could cause you to stop you from going to high-sec gate and station guns do not protect the pilot enough 4. pilots in space can get scanned way too easyif these are solved i believe people will populate low sec a bit more. solutions to these problems:1. make the rewards substantial for the mission runners. in case you don't know ccp they do risk there ship when doing missions. and because scanning is so easy, they wont go there.2.when doing exploration, make sure the payout give you lots more isk in return. seriously, i've scanned in low sec for a while and the payout is the same with radar sites for example than in highsec 3.the most shocking of all, dont change anything but when you engage someone dont remove security status loss..nothing else. dont touch the gcc, only the securty status...i'm not asking much here.4.mhhh this might seem stupid but how about some neut towers on gates and stations. that would make rr battleships gatecamping a bit harder..if not impossible. in the end that would tell people that you wont lose your ship if you enter low sec space.5. this one might not be liked but its just ideas anyway, make scanning ships a bit harder..or at least the ones in missions. that way, mission runners would be more appealed by this feature if they go in low sec. the would still be vulnerable on gates, stations and such.6. more entry points to go inside low sec. less chance of getting caught in a gatecamp. the same could apply to null sec entry points.note: i realise number 4 is kinda debatable but ask a mission runner or anyone why they wont go in low sec ? one of the answer would be ""i hate gatecamps"". those in low-sec are usually done from pirates corps with a load of battleship which are able to tank the sentry guns. so either neut towers should do the trick. no cap, no rr. theres not a lot of ships that will be able to tank in this situation."

6/10/2010,it's annoying enough before a buff...
6/10/2010,"probably 120 times a day the question is asked ""how do i join chat channels?""then on the accessability front, the removal of zoom buttons...or the font issue.....ccp have often shown that usability and accessability are not their strong suit.steps should be taken to improve these areas of qa testing."
6/10/2010,"ccp needs to farm out the ui work entirely. its clear their either incapable of doing it right or simply don't care. of course, the same could be said of bugfixing, game balance, meaningful content additions..i fear tyrannis may have been the last straw for a lot of us. the next six months will make or break eve for me, and ccp's record so far gives me little confidnence"
6/10/2010,"no guys, usability testing is not about watching tutorials or playing on the test server, it's about inviting users (not employees or csm), give them a list of tasks, and observe their every action. like the author says, it'll force most programmers to rethink most of their 'wonderful creations' (although they are so rarely qualified to handle user interfaces). that said, eve's ui is being used to display massive amounts of information and do an incredible amount of tasks. i think it does pretty well, but i can think of dozens of improvements. i also know that whatever i can think off, more than 90% will be deemed complete nonsense when exposed to serious usability testing."
6/10/2010,"its just like rl politics - those with the resources to stuff the ballot box will get a seat at the table. i suspect this is by design, so ccp can say, ""its what the people voted for"" and then do what they would've done anyway (i.e. more pvp content, more pro-pirate game changes, removal of more useful functions, addition of more meaningless functions, etc.).."

6/10/2010,"the goal of any anti-macro solution should be to make mining require players to do something that cannot me automated, or at least cannot be automated effectively. and to do so without changing mining so that it cannot be done casually.my suggestion for this is to make mining more visual. what i mean by this is to have visual properties of the asteroid be what determines its content.this means removing type-specific information from the overview and other sources. heres a full list of suggested changes.- remove type-specific labels for asteroids in the overview and directional scanner, have them only say 'asteroid' or something.- remove type-specific labels (and images?) from the targeted asteroid, again having the name just say asteroid, and maybe a generic roid image.- remove type-specific information from asteroids in the cargohold. in this case all veldspars could just be listed as veldspar in the hold. making them behave a bit like bpcsbut we cant remove all of this information without giving players a way to determine yield. so we should increase the effectiveness of scanners and make them more visual.- change 'roid scanners to be more like the pi resource scan, overlaying colors on the roid to determine the quality of the roid.- introduce subtle graphical differences (without scan) between different qualtiy roids of the same type.- introduce lower quality ores in asteroids, no actual player would sit there and harvest something for lesser yield.- make it so asteroids don't disappear when depleted. just make the stupid macro harvest 'depleted veldspar' for 10% the regular yield"
6/10/2010,the only way to prevent bots is for ccp to actually do ban bots and also ban isk buyers
6/10/2010,"yes, macros recognize colors and shapes. your pi map won't help."
6/10/2010,"its not to make macroing outright impossible, but to make it more difficult for them. and at the least would stop your small-time macroers from just making thier own.also wouldnt determining which roid it is in space be a bit difficult for a macro program? with other roids in the view and such?"
6/10/2010,"the macros will just adapt their programs, in the meantime its taking up ccp's resources to implement and annoying the rest of the non-macroing playerbase.not supported."
6/10/2010,"supported in principle, but not in practice.a lot of your ideas are neat, but they wouldn't help macro mining in any great capacity. they'd probably kill off the lower end macro miners who only do it because it's got a low risk to profit to difficulty ratio, but beyond that..if you believe mining needs a revamp (and by christ it does), then by all means work on a revamp; but it's a bad idea to try and revamp mining based on how macro miners operate, because macro miners can adapt much faster than ccp can. mining being difficult to macro should be an emergent side-effect, nothing more."
6/10/2010,yes please.
6/10/2010,"hes talking about moving a vehicle not a dwelling, so your analogy is way off. when i brought my car to the states from germany they did not disassemble it before putting it on the transport ship. it was transported and delivered in one peice.i support this idea."
6/10/2010,"agree with the ""pirate agents"" comment. it makes no sense that most of the best corp agents are in low-sec. there should be independent faction and pirate stations there, and nothing else. well, maybe the occasional really well defended navy station (a ""frontier fort"" kind of thing), but those should be rare."
6/10/2010,"yes, it does. more risk, more reward.also, i'm miyamoto isoruku, and i don't support this thread."
6/10/2010,"sadly i don't think you can put pirate agents in lowsec as lowsec is still empire space. while i'd like to see them there... i sadly don't see it as fitting.as to removal of all agents from lowsec, you best be trolling, if you're not, well you should stay home and prepare for nine acts of penetration."

6/10/2010,"no, it wouldn't. think this through. you want to install twice as many extractors, and have them running half as often. what exactly does that do for you? it wastes your money, demands more storage space than you would otherwise need, and requires more time/effort to do all the onlining/offlining. and you have no extra production to show for it."

6/11/2010,updated. now i'm not too sure if we should just keep this list down to glaring bug-like pi problems or open it up to improvements on what is there/intended. personally i'm inclined to keep it to just the worst and most obvious failures.
6/11/2010,"tentative support.storage facilities are not useless. if you don't like them, don't use them.button is fine. if you can't be bothered to look at what you are clicking when your ship is about to pop...tentative support.transparency is nice, so ccp saying why the rock is off limits would be nice. that being said, there are a lot of planets in nullsec. ccp justifying why every single one is off limits would take the effort required to botch pi and remake it from scratch.if it is off limits, assume it is relevant to eve lore, and letting capsuleers' grimy paws on it would gum up the works.expedited transferuse what you need.tentative support."
6/11/2010,"their functions are carried out better, with additional value, by spaceports. i'd like to use them but there is no point.bad ui is not fine, especially when it's such a simple thing. accidentally entering a loading screen would easily get your pod popped because it essentially takes away control of your ship.again it'd be nice if storage could be routed to one another.that's the idea."
6/11/2010,"supported.i recently got a friend to try out the game, loved the tutorial and was interested. he's still up in the air about subscribing/buying but when i explained he'd be well off training learning skill first it somewhat deflated him. he's a smart enough player to realize they are extremely helpful long term, but what i think some of the detractors here fail to forget is that sinking 2 weeks - 1month into something is commonplace when you have 20m sp, during your first month or two when you can hardly fly anything or use anything, buckling down and training for nothing but +1 attributes for weeks seems...lame.removing skills and giving everyone +10 and +10% simply makes it easier for new players to get into the game. i'd appreciate a refund, but it's really not necessary. and if this is one more thing that helps retain new subscribers, then i'm all for it. new people are the continued life of the game."
6/11/2010,"screw it i dont even care any more. just give me my 1,892,315 sp back and we can all get on with our lives."
6/11/2010,"if ccp are taking away the deep safe spots because they are an advantage to older players that have them, then they should take away learning skills as well. it is the same principle; newer players are at a disadvantage because of the lack of the learning skills being trained, where as the older players already have them.and for those that will argue that the difference is that you cannot make the safe spots anymore, where as you can still train the learning skills, new players get a 2x training time multiplier for 1.6m sp's, whereas we did not get that a few years ago. i think it is best to get rid of the learning skills, and credit them to the players in a way that they can distribute them to skills as they see fit, not as an increase to training speed. the time was already spent in training the skills, so we should be able to keep those sp's and not spend even more time to get them back.i support this idea."
6/11/2010,"not supported.learning skills are not the factor that drive newer players away. it is the factor that drives players that would much rather play wow away.we have to be careful how much we dilute this game and make skill progression too easy. when i was a noob i invested the time for learning skills, i was not bored. i killed a few miners, i had a war, even though i was a corporation of one. if you define your time in eve as skills, then you are missing the point. eve is about stories, not skills. if you wont play a game because of a little thing like learning skills, then gtfo. these people are not going to contribute to wild and adventurous things within eve, just more whines and more standardization. eve is a sandbox, unfortunately as more time passes i see a growing trend in eve to move away from the traditional chaos and diversity to standardization. less flavour and more of the same. learning skills are vital to the ""butterfly effect"" of eve and should not be regarded as just a skill set that does nothing. they create a greater differentiation between all players; new and old. this means that age isn't everything in eve as like so many other choices, learning skills in effect create a discontinuity that eve imo is defined by. be careful how many of these things you standardise, because the eve you know and love is in danger of becoming just another mmo.learning skills should stay for the benefit of eve's dynamism. at some point ccp needs to consider it's original vision over its drive for rl isk. too much growth without a consolidation period will always end in disaster. ccp this will really change the make up of the player population of eve and that is not a good thing. the vets who want to remove learning skills, just don't want to train new alt #2487 up again. don't depend too much on capital from addicts, its not ethical."
6/11/2010,"by that logic we should get rid of level v skills because the vets have more of them than the new players, and it takes sooo long for the poor newbies to train them! hell, let's get rid of isk - the vets have more than the newbies! capital ships.. those damn veterans have more of those - everything must go! every new account should have all of the same stuff as a five year old account! where does the whining/madness stop? still not supported."
6/11/2010,"mmmmm, yes."
6/11/2010,"learning skills don't do anything.they don't influence how well your ship flies. they don't influence your guns. they don't influence your market abilities or your industrial investments.if you remove any other skill, then you take some depth out of combat or industry. something is lost. but if you removed a learning skill, nothing would change. level 1 skills would still be level 1 skills and level 5 skills would still be level 5 skills.this is an important distinction that not enough people seem to get.you could say that without them you get too many people with too high skills, but given how big and grindy eve is even with maxed stats, i don't think that's fair to say.did you know that it'll take me over a month to get advanced weapon upgrades to level 5? a month for a 2% decrease in powergrid requirements for turrets and launcher bays.somehow i don't think eve is going to collapse if we kill off learning skills."
6/11/2010,tell that to someone who never trains any of them.and if you remove these you take some depth out of the skill tree.
6/11/2010,solution 1 is fully supported.wasting time to save time; wasn't that fun a game concept after all.
6/11/2010,the learning skills are the only skills that offer any depth at all in the skill tree; without them it is simply a direct train to whatever you want.
6/11/2010,"definitely a direct train when you're going after something like the triage module... yep any noob can train it and use it effectively. the ""depth"" you speak of is a bad thing. -liang"
6/11/2010,"you are standing here. you are telling me, with a straight face, that you would turn down the following:reimbursement of a load of skill points (and maybe a minor isk reimbursement)a friendlier world for newbies who will never have any hope of overpowering you anywaypossibly faster training times (depending on if you have your learning skills maxed or not)at the cost of:11 skills that all have the same basic meta affect and that have never had any direct influence on industry or combat are now obsoleteyou would actually sacrifice the good not just of others but also of yourself in the name of having 11 extra icons on your skills interface. an interface which is already loaded with skills, an interface that you could never hope of fully filling in anyway.you are either a masochist, a sadist, or obsessive compulsive. either you like suffering, you like seeing others suffer, or having those learning skills fulfills some deep need in you to see large completed spreadsheets. i have been over the problem a dozen times. you're not an idiot, like many. you understand the problem. you understand the arguments. you just don't agree for some bizarre reason that i may simply be unable to appreciate because i'm cursed with a mind that's designed to think outside of its own space.the only people who enjoy getting learning skills are those who enjoy seeing progress bars climb. the enjoyment of watching progress bars climb could be better spent on other skills without screwing over all but an obsessive minority. any new player presented with all the facts would surely choose to have learning skills removed.perhaps you simply have a burning desire for the days of old, and will cling to that past even if it leaves the world around you burning. either way, i give up. i don't know what convoluted agenda you hold, but i am certain that it is deep seated, emotional, and altogether irrational.fitting for a gallente."
6/11/2010,"while that was quite a well written analysis, it is predicated on the assumption that i care if they remove the learning skills. i don't. (nor do i see any reason to 'reimburse' vets for skills they would effectively still have)i have no agenda. remove them, don't remove them, makes no difference to me. i simply disagree with the arguments made in favour of removing them."
6/11/2010,"currently, from my experience, exploration can be a nice profession, however, some aspects do not seam to be balanced. the balance between the types of exploration sites greatly varies. for this, i will assume that radar sites are standard, and acceptable. so from there, things will be compared. (from my experience from exploration)currently, radar sites can yield a decent surprise, for me, its a 40%-60% chance of being worth the time. sometimes i will find a radar site, and there be nothing inside at all, and even rarer (as expected) i will 'hit it big'. grav sites are pretty much similar, the harder the site is to find, the more valuable the assets within. the best sites really cant be found with out the specialized ships. (example given by finding a bistot/crokite site in low sec, scanning from a standard cruiser, was not able to pin 100% scan, this imo would be expected for such a valuable site) grav sites, like radar sites, in their own way, scale appropriately. ladar sites: i honestly having found enough of these to rate them, the ones i have found (since aprocrypha) needed hacking tools, and those sites were worth the effort. now, the issue:but the seriously unbalanced part, magnetometric sites. i have found myself wanting to ignore these, but, as an explorer, i just cant. but every time i find one, they are not worth the time. when salvage is found its just not worth the time for a salvager to cycle. i can get more salvage from a level 1 mission. and then, the chances for anything else seam crazy. from my experience, mag sites just are not worth the time to bother looking for. i feel that mag sites should be brought in line with the other types of sites, and be a bit more worth the effort. for salvage find, i feel the amount of salvage in each can should be increased per chance. for the ""big find"" sites, possibly increase the chance of a rig bp or skill find.if this issue has been raised before, feel free to flame me, then get on with your life."
6/11/2010,"though i agree, i think magneto sites in w-space is where they become valuable as sleeper salvage is where money is.for highsec at least, where are some thoughsradar sites are goodmagnetic sites are next to worthlessgrav sites are ridiculously hard to pinpointhave never seen ladar."
6/11/2010,"mag sites are the salvage ones right? yeah, i wish they'd just remove them because the frig rats that spawn to defend the cans are worth more than whatever might be inside the cans. sofreakingworthless!-liang"
6/11/2010,yep they need fixing big time they should drop t2 salvage sometimes and also blueprints that are worth something i once found a large t2 bpc and was super happy but then i saw that no one ever uses powergrid subroutine maximizer ii's
6/11/2010,"mag sites, in general, are really quite awful. i run them anyway because that's the kind of person i am, but srsly, it's rarely worth the time. in fact, i don't think i have received anything worthwhile from a mag site in at least six months..."
6/11/2010,"i love to be the one that throws the spanner in to your little steem engine, but :high security scan sites are not suposed to be isk printing machines, they are to give u a taste of the things you could be getting more of in low and null sec.there is nothing wrong with magnometric sites at they currently stand, they can drop obsceen amount of salvage (or they can yeld none) i usualy run these sites in low sec and i have run them in 0.0 b4 now,u can expect:large quantitys of t1 salvage componentst2 salvage dus drop quite often for merigging skill bookst2 rig bpc's (in the realy good sites)if ur not having luck with mag sites in high sec just find a quiet spot in low/0.0 to scan and do the sites there u will soon change ur oppinions reguarding mag sites"

6/11/2010,supported if only to encourage csm and ccp review of hybrids.
6/11/2010,definite +1 from me.
6/11/2010,"the comparison to wow was made, but it's more of a similarity with dull and boring than it is a difference.the main difference is that everything in wow is tied to a story. in eve, ccp hides their lack of story-driven elements behind ""it's a sandbox, do whatever you want"". they apparently aren't willing or able to shape and mold the game and the story around the actions of the players. in a game like this, what players do today should define what happens to players tomorrow. instead, player actions have very few consequences.the missions eve has would be more closely related to wow's ""daily quests"": repetitive grindfests earning reputation/standing and money. all games have these kinds of missions. the games that either fail or never develop more than just a niche following never move beyond these kinds of missions. the games that draw a large following offer a lot of content for a lot of different people and actually spend time to develop that content fully.this is where eve fails the hardest: they have a lot of awesome content, but the implementation is only prototype-quality, not release-quality. spending some time to revisit their existing content and making it ""excellent"" would benefit the game far more than continually adding additional half-baked ideas."
6/11/2010,"normally i would support these kind of proposals, but i believe there are other game elements that are in much greater need of improvement and care than missions, so i have no interest in this one getting higher priority within the pipe at the moment."
6/11/2010,well said imho :p
6/11/2010,"clearly it is under the current set of rules possible to do insurance fraud ( as it is looked at in rl ) legally within the game.however, i agree with what goose99 said, note my change :""when you destroy the ship to collect insurance fees, it should be insurance fraud. when you try to keep the ship alive to the best of your abilities, and thus, trying to prevent yourself from collecting insurance, it's eve pvp.in the first case, you have a conflict of interest that runs counter to insurance. in the 2nd, your interest align with the insurance."" so this is how it should be.furthermore, evading concord is against the rules, therefore you meet certain death after suicide ganking.so it is the same as selfdestructing basically."
6/11/2010,"because it's a game and not real life?so basically, u've contributed nothing but a support without any of your own supporting statements...well besides the notion that a loss to an npc is somehow the same as self-destructing..."
6/11/2010,"fellow capsuleers!i'm member of a pirate corporation which recently joined the amarr factional warfare. we have encountered a very irritating problem: whenever we remote repair any of your (outlaw) corp mates, we recieve a -0,75% amarr faction standing penalty.we found that out when we tried to examine why our amarr corp standing was going to dangerously low levels. checks on standing logs revealed the issue. we immediatly stopped using logistic ships and doing rr bs gangs and petitioned it. this is what gms had to say: this is obviously stupid: -why would amarr empire penaltize me for repping members of their own armed forces? if they hate pirates so much, they would deny access to fw for everyone with negative security rating in the first place, wouldn't they?-if empire factions do not like repping criminals, why do i not lose any faction standings when i'm not a member of a militia?-this makes it impossible for anyone with negative security rating to do rr bs gangs or use logistic ships, because this will eventually get them kicked out of the militia.if this game mechanic does not change, my corporation will be forced to leave amarr fw only because we are remote repping our corp mates!this makes absolutely no sense. it needs to be fixed. some csm support would be greatly appreciated. this thread proves that the issue has now existed for almost 1,5 years and nothing has changed:"
6/11/2010,"yes this is just stupid, ive experienced this before, it was enough to rep a member with just a slight negative sec status to loose standings."
6/11/2010,"i absolutely agree. the standing loss makes absolutely no sense *at all*.first: you do the amarr navy a favor by repping one of their militia members, so if anything you should get a standing gain, not a loss.second: the claim ""but you support a criminal and thats a criminal act!"" is also nonsense, because if i kill dozens of ships (or even pods) i do a lot of criminal acts as well without losing any standing to one of the factions.third: if the factions do not tolerate outlaws, they should not hire them for their militia.change it."
6/11/2010,"that's ridiculous, and good to know.supported."
6/11/2010,"meh, i've known about this for a really long time - maybe 3 years or so? i can go with you getting a notification of your aggression being extended, but this is a legitimate thing to use, situationally.-liang"
6/11/2010,"well, basically it just looks like an extension. the fact, that it's invisible makes it even worse on my book.someone does an act of agression towards you and you are the one, who takes the penalty instead of the agressor. how can that be legitimate? am i missing something?"
6/11/2010,"if you have an aggression counter towards you, that counter should be visible, regardless."
6/11/2010,"fully agreed, the status quo is silly."
6/11/2010,"supported.if you're going to have a timer on display, it should be accurate no matter what."
6/11/2010,"wait, you attacked them and got aggression. aggression is and should be renewed with any hostile action by either party. no, i don't really support changing it, but i do support the timer always being accurate.-liang"
6/11/2010,"said ""timer"" better be effing present or its an effing exploit.no if's and's or but's about it.don't give a crap about who extends what and where and how... no ""visible"" timer means its crap.end of story.ps: although extending it is a bit of a cheap shot to be quite honest. 15 minutes is more than enough time to go find someone... and you get what.. 5 to bar them from docking up/gating out? please... cry me a river."
6/11/2010,"maybe next time you won't engage somebody with lethal force just because they took an item from you.you started the fight. pay the price.i too want this bug fixing. it's an entirely unreliable means of extending aggro. if they leave system, it barely works at all, and then if you dock yourself you sometimes end up being vulnerable but no longer with shooting rights.ccp fix this immediately so that i can extend aggro indefinitely and reliably against these vigilante thugs and their associates."
6/11/2010,"this should be fixed, but cpp likes to ignore it. for me this is a very unfair exploit. ccp really sucks, if they dont fix this fast."
6/11/2010,this.
6/11/2010,1:2: if your going to support it... support it.ps: word of advise... read... it helps.
6/11/2010,wow you actually think you're ~funny~
6/11/2010,agreed. modal dialogs are only justified when the application's proper functioning depends on there being user input.
6/11/2010,agreed.
6/11/2010,"exactly what it says on the box. right click space, expand the ""stargates"" menu, and see something like:to laah (0.9)to oichiya (0.8)just a basic convenience for finding out the security levels of adjacent systems without having to open up your map."

6/11/2010,"i support, alot faster than viewing the jump when looking around"
6/11/2010,"after a good month of hashing this topic out among various forums, this is the general consensus that most players seem to agree on.here is the very simple fix that all interdictors need.1) immune to warp bubbles (especially their own).2) get a +15% speed boost to afterburners per level.3) reduced sig radius to 50-55.4) have no bonuses to turrets.interdictors should be all about dropping that bubble and getting out alive, with no emphasis on dps whatsoever. we have reduced their sig radius and made using ab's the preferable propulsion module.on the subject of t1 destroyers.1) reduce sig radius to 50-552) remove rof penalty3) remove two high slots4) add one low and one medium slot to each destroyer5) give each one a +5% speed boost to afterburners per level.6) allow each destroyer to shoot out to 30km with a comfortable fit.7) replace falloff bonus on the catalyst with a +5% damage bonus or give the catalyst a larger drone bay.8) remove tracking bonus on corm and give +5% damage per level bonus. it's a boat that can snipe over 100km, tracking is unnecessary check this link to see the 100km sniping corm"
6/11/2010,"add a proper salvaging vessel to the game, since you are nerfing my current one with these changes and turn these combat ships and others like them into a clear secondary option for salvagers."
6/11/2010,"you should open a new thread asking for a salvaging cruiser then, your comment is borderline trolling, except i know that you are serious.giving my support since there's apparently no large objection to this."
6/11/2010,1. cross posting is bad.2. you should link your features & ideas thread if you insist on doing it.
6/11/2010,"the point of this f & i forum is to work out ideas before bringing them to the assembly hall. i've made several different posts on the subject there for over a month now. as i've seen no large objections other than ""lol salvage boats will be ruined"" i think its time to move it here."
6/11/2010,then you should post in ah *after* you got a good consensus in f&i. atm you got not one thread where people didnt state that your ideas are overpowered. and in the end your ideas get discussed in 2 places in the meantime.so be a bit patient and keep discussing your ideas in f&i before bringing them to the ah.
6/11/2010,"hello,some time ago i made a thread in the ideas section and some people seamed to like the idea so i'm going to post it here. maybe one day it will be put into eve.whats the idea?the idea is to place conquerable structures in different lowsec systems.to conquer them you have to shoot down the shilds, then a npc will contact you an tell you they will pay you if you stop shooting them. the structures should have enough hp so a 5 man gang will need around 5-10 minutes to conquer them. they will pay the money directly to your corp, every 20 minutes. they will only pay you if there shilds are at 50% or higher and not during downtimes.i thougt that 10 million per paycycle could be enough. so big blobs will be useable but not profitable.every time they are conquered the payment will be lowered a bit, the npcs are interrupted and have to repair some damages :-)it will regenerate after some time. so constantly fighting over 1 structures makes it inefficient and encourages people to move around.if the structures you own get attacked, your corp will get a mail telling you.and the attackers will get global aggro or so, so you can shoot them without geting a sechit.there should only be 1 or 2 of them per system and the next system with such a structure should be 2 or 3 jumps away, so gatecamping a system isn't too usefull.structures could be pleasure hubs or mining colonys or other things we already have in missions. so no additional models have to be created.goal of the ideai would wish to see many small roaming gangs of 5-10 people running through lowsec and ""stealing"" each others structures or defending there own. so they have something to do, if there are no enemys around and something thats profitable for them. and cause of there low hp and no rf timers the big alliances won't be interrested, cause it's to much work to defend them all, not like moons.hope you like and support it."
6/11/2010,what you describe sounds pretty much like conquering systems in faction warfare.did you ever try that?
6/11/2010,"well pi is up and running and its truly awesome..did i mention the export/import taxes? well i had a sudden stroke i mean a sudden idea..well with all issues surrounding player owned/operated ""banks"" why not tax those taxes and create an investment bank system..truly with all the tax income it would conceivably be self sustaining..players could invest money in the form of savings and or be able to receive loans..each bank would be run by its respective empire.i'm sure their would be issues involved development wise but hey ccp has shown its genius why not put some brain power on this?"
6/11/2010,"there's a caldari ecm boat. i understand that caldari are the e-war race, but it seems unfair that the other races don't have an e-war boat.thus, i propose ccp convert the dominix from a drone boat to a damp boat, the armageddon to a tracking disruptor boat, and the typhoon to a target painter boat.edit:give the dominix: a damp bonus instead of a blaster damage bonusgive the typhoon: a target painter bonus instead of a turret r.o.f. bonusgive the armageddon: i'm not sure, maybe a neut/nos bonus (a small one so that the bhaalghorn isn't just an expensive armageddon) instead of a turret cap use bonus, but a tracking disruptor range bonus would be interesting too for fleet work"
6/11/2010,ban forum trolls?
6/11/2010,i'm in a player corp.
6/11/2010,this.
6/11/2010,"wait, i really like this. i'll definitely trade the gun rof bonus for a painter bonus and an extra launcher slot... -liang"
6/11/2010,and only gallente have a drone battleship. your point is?everything doesn't have to be so symmetrical. i mean just look at caldari ships...
6/11/2010,"symetrical or not, the current state of affairs are inconsistent. for frigates and cruisers, each race get their ewar ship, but for battleships, only the caldari gets it.however, removing an existing bonus from the geddon, the domi and the phoon for a new ewar bonus to tds, rsds and tps repectively will essentially gimp those ships badly and render them more or less useless. the scorpion has its niche, but i dont see much need for a tech 1 battleship with bonus to targetpainters (nice for missions maybe but meh).what you could do however, is include a tier 2 ewar bouns. it will still be consistent, as the caldari ewar are the same (ecm) for both tier 1 and tier 2. in this way, the geddon will get a neut/nos bonus (like the bhaalghorn, but without the webbing bonus), the domi will get a bonus to warp scrambler range while the phoon gets a webbing bonus.this will ensure that each race have an ewar bs, but with a tier 2 ewar bonus (beeing battleships and all). this is just a comment though, i am sure all my esteemed collegues out there will have lots of misgivings lol."
6/11/2010,"i propose:scorpion:- lose ecm range bonus (it's useless anyway) and increase ecm str bonus to 25%/lvl (since you have to be up in people's grill now)- replace ecm range bonus with 5% launcher rof bonus- trade a high for a low and add a launcher slotfinal result:5/8/5, 5 launchers, 5% launcher rof bonus, 25% ecm strength/lvltyphoon:- trade turret rof bonus for painter bonus- +1 launcher slot- add some fittings to accomodate being an ewar bs. :)geddon:- trade cap consumption bonus for 15% nos/neut amount bonusdomi: touch and die *******.-lianged: and in case you can't tell, i'm dead serious about changing the scorp and only half serious about the phoon/geddon. i'd be so stoked on the geddon change."
6/11/2010,"the typhoon doesn't have enough grid or cpu to fit another torpedo launcher and still be useful. even as it is now, it's forced to brick itself (3x trimarks really crush its speed) since it's almost impossible to fit an effective active tank.but of course ccp could give it more grid/cpu to fit a sixth launcher."
6/11/2010,"if ccp focused on walking in stations, women would have avatars that they can associate with and would be drawn to eve more. a lot of women play warcraft and it has human-like avatars.-vag"
6/11/2010,the new nooma k'larr of the assembly hall?
6/11/2010,"worse, at least nooma had some sense of reality."
6/11/2010,"for the record, the op threatened my spreadsheets. there can be no greater offense."
6/11/2010,"if eve fanboys were less obnoxious, women would be drawn to eve more."
6/11/2010,"no offense, but i didn't need a human like avatar to make me come play eve. if that's what you're looking for, perhaps imvu would be more your style."
6/11/2010,eve players are to mmo players what mmo players are to normal people.
6/11/2010,this would eliminate all the troll posters.
6/11/2010,"looks at the op's corp name.no, no it wouldn't."
6/11/2010,care to elaborate? at least support your argument with valid evidence instead of simply stating it.
6/11/2010,"your post history is evidence enough for me, combined with the fact that you're not in a npc school."
6/11/2010,i concur.q.e.d.
6/11/2010,trial accounts cannot post and troll posters get banned off the forums. it should not be more difficult than that.
6/11/2010,"troll posters don't get banned though, even when there is a community consensus that they should go. (emo tj comes to mind)"
6/11/2010,"you are wrong. a computer has no default. the default is what the programmer wrote. some ccp hired or contracted programmer had to first select which key to use and then define the function of that key. i'm going to give you a bad example of a programmer screwing with people.here's an example of a programmer purposely being a clown:1) programmer selects the backspace key2) programmer defines that the backspace key will select the yes option in the warning window.3) programmer selects mouse 2 (right-click)4) 2) programmer defines that the mouse 2 key will select the no option in the warning window when hovering over the yes option.what this translates to:if you press backspace, you will proceed with the action (if you press enter nothing happens because enter is not defined). if you left-click on yes or no, nothing will happen because mouse-1 isn't defined either. only if you right-click on no will something happen, except it will still choose yes (this is very common for pop-up windows on websites and other types of malicious adware).the result: you will be a very confused and angry person.here's an example of what the ccp programmer did:1) programmer selects the enter key2) programmer defines that the enter key will select the yes option in the warning window.3) programmer selects mouse 1 (left-click)4) programmer defines that the mouse 1 key will select the yes option in the warning window when hovering over the yes option.5) programmer defines that the mouse 1 key will select the no option in the warning window when hovering over the no option.the result: you are not angry nor confused if you use your mouse to click on the warning window. however, if you use your keyboard and hit enter, you will accidentally commit a criminal action in high-sec space.in the future, don't make comments on things you really do not understand. you tend to hang around these forums a lot and makes lots of comments that just make no sense."
6/11/2010,"enter (return) and/or y and/or yes are confirmation commands by default in every operating system i've ever heard of. though you are right that it is a human defined convention and nothing intrinsic to the machine.you assert that a user could mistakenly think that enter means no, but offer no reasoning. that was a lot of typing to end up saying nothing."
6/11/2010,"while i haven't lost ships to this several times i have ""selected"" yes when i didn't wanted to do it simply because i was typing in chat and the pop up appeared wen i was completing my phrase.at 200 keys/minute you are several keys ahead of the pc when the pop up appears and you don't have the time to stop."
6/11/2010,"1. what ever the solution it needs to be consistent. always yes or no in every confirmation window in the game. one of the most horrible things in a ui is inconsistency and eve doesn't need any more problems in the ui department.2. players need to be able to disable all of these windows. currently you can just hit enter when an annoying mandatory window blocks your action. it is still crap, but infinitely better than changing the default option to no.3. enter is the confirmation key in every program i think i have ever used, so i don't really agree with this. catering to the few exceptions who haven't grasped that concept is not a good reason to punish the majority who have."
6/11/2010,"no, enter should always be to confirm, i.e. actually doing whatever command you had already issued. why would you think that enter means cancel?i would support a proposal for clearer error messages, though."
6/11/2010,"ladies and gentlemen,the csm was originally intended as a way to get things done in game that the player base by and large, viewed as necessary to improve the game.however, recently, in the campaign video of eva jobse, it was mentioned that there is currently a huge backlog of issues that were approved by the csm and brought to ccp... and that nothing is being done with them, and that it is possible that many of them are now invalid due to changes in the game systems that have happened since they were submitted.it is this player's opinion that it is time for ccp and the csm to be a little more transparent with what's submitted and what's been implemented thus far by ccp in the game.because lets face it, the csm is only effective and working as it was originally intended if the issues that are submitted to ccp are actually implemented and not completely ignored by the development team in favor of devoting development time to new and shiny features to attract more lemmings to the cliff. so... i leave it to you, the csm, and ccp... lets have it... how many of the changes that the players have brought forth to the csm that have been submitted to ccp have actually been implemented? or is the csm actually what many people have come to suspect it to be... a farce in place to only appease the players while maintaining the status quo?i think it's time to actually see some of the results of the csm so the players can see that it is in fact, not just a free trip to iceland and gaining inside information that has in the past been abused by at least one csm member.drachenlord"
6/11/2010,"i just wish, when you are podded, you get reminded to purchase a new clone if you ask it too. hell i'd pay for it like 10k isk a week or somthing stupid for it to say""congratulations on your resurrection success, don't forget, buy a new clone to avoid loss"" upon dieing"
6/11/2010,i'm sorry but there is just no justifiable cause or concern for this to even be considered.it is your responsibility to check your clone.not the machine... not the server... not your friend or your neighbor.with tools like evemon and evehq... you literally have no excuse.what's next? a little reminder to remind you to push the button to shoot your guns?demeaning or not... human error does not need a patch.it's called experience... you'll forget once... twice? not likely.not supporting a patch for absent-mindedness.
6/11/2010,"drake you didn't address what benifit it brings to the game, flying a half bil ship into a gate camp provides benifit to others on your expense, flying it into rats and going afk provides incentive to be careful and take care of your assets, isk loss is a fine and justifiable penalty for complacency or mistakes, but as i said it's easy if you haven't done it or done it in awhile to be on your high horse and say you're dumb live and learn but it's a simple mistake anyone can make, and one i do not normally do, in fact i've never done it before so over a year, until one day i remember updating my clone but forget it was prior to my last death, a simple mistake anyone could make and wham -1 month training, i think this penalty should be switch partially to an isk or time penalty by having a 100 mil or difficult to obtain backup clone you now have to renew, instead of all your skills being pwnt, updating your clone helps the game by adding to the death penalty in clone costs, but with a difficult to obtain back up this incentive is kept in game, still giving a huge penalty for the complacency of it since you lose the back up, without causing over frustration losing 1 month in training without even giving satisfaction to other players on your expense(which if it did would be fine with me, eve should be cold hearted)"
6/11/2010,who said anything about benefits?when i fly into low-sec space with a outdated clone am i suppose to pony up like some little poor nooblet and demand benefits for my stupidity?what is this? hello kitty online?i think not.... your saddly and poorly and lacking in seirous knowledge here. (literally... figuiritvly..and aparnetly...skill points wise)no one said anything about getting benefits for playing eve online.they did say its an experince you won't forget.in short - welcome to eve online.
6/11/2010,"any in game mechanic should provide a benifit to the game in some way, not just frustration, leaving frustrations in that provide no benifit is a recipe for medicrity, i'm advocating for the sp penalty for this to be switched to an extreme isk penalty or time consuming penalty in the form i have proposed by back up clone because i believe it would acomplish the same things, not degrade the eve experiance in any way while lessoning a huge frustration some players(some due to negligence others to an honest msitake anyone could make) will encounter. either way there is a severe penalty for fogetting, just i dont see why one of arguable the worst penalties in the game is for a simple mistake anyone can make and one that provides no benefit to other players in comparison isk wise or satisfaction wise. just my thoughts agreeing to disagree is fine."
6/11/2010,"uh ya there is a big difference b/t flying into lowsec with an outdated clone and fighting in 0.0 where you will be podded and cant do anything about it and wakeup in station to hop into another ship and undock into the fight having forgotten to upgrade your new clone.i would like a popup reminder (that you can turn off, if you wanna be hardcore lol) when you try to undock that lets you know you havn't updated your clone. i dont think thats unreasonable. you can play more often and get more isk/ships to replace losses...nothing hurts like sp loss tho."
6/11/2010,all i see is a pathetic excuse for a lapse in memory.seriously... i was in 0.0... i had access to clone bays.most alliances worth there salt has such resources available.stop making excuses and just deal with the problem.a reminder will only fuel this little issue more than necessary.
6/11/2010,not supported.a far easier solution would be to just make clone contracts auto-renew unless you cancelled it or didn't have the money.problem solved.
6/11/2010,you do realize evemon warns you if your clone is insufficient?
6/11/2010,"you do realize relying on a third party program to improve an in game mechanic to an acceptable state isn't a valid solution? i would support an option to auto renew your clone contract and a notice if your isk balance can't cover it, would be a simpler fix, btw no one trashing this proposal has listed a benifit it gives to the game that the proposed option doesnt have, your just trashing it because is human nature to feel ""above"" the issue if you havent done it before or in awhile and just say your an idiot, actually look at the pros and cons of both please"
6/11/2010,"ehh.one the one hand you have nobody to blame for this but yourself.on the other hand, there are popup boxes for ""you are about to engage in a dangerous act"" and ""you are about to wander into lowsec"", so why not ""you are about to undock without a proper clone""?supported if only because it might help some newbies and it'd be p-ss easy to implement."
6/11/2010,this sort of puffing up when someone downplays their rep is what perpetuates the myth.edit: i do think that low sec agents need more incentive however. i also think conq 0.0 needs agents but that's an entirely different issue.
6/11/2010,"lol at ""care bear""and your right, low sec isnt full of pirates, just the initial jump in, which is of course where you die.i would rather be aloud to decline as many low sec missions as i want with no penalty instead of none at all"
6/11/2010,"i had hoped that the snarky comment about my 13 billion isk pve ship would have tipped people off... i would argue that all low sec rewards and mechanics be normalized around 0.1 space. 0.1 is sufficiently different from 0.0, and the rewards are much better than high sec. and all low sec is equally dangerous (which is to say that it's not instant death on a stick, but even the most wary of us will end up getting screwed occasionally).yeah - maybe an ""(amarr|caldari|gallente|minmatar) relations upgrade"" which puts an agent from the appropriate faction? maybe fw-like agents which examine your red list and their sov space and put up smallish missions to be run in their space [to incentivize a roam]. dunno.-liang"
6/11/2010,supported. why should high sec agents give low sec destinations? there is no point since high sec mission runners are only going to decline them anyway. i cant really see high sec dwellers being forced there it may make them less likely to be interested in low sec as a whole. if they want to join us in 0.0 im sure they will once they can make the isk.
6/11/2010,"there's already ecm burst. to make caldari e-war less proportionally overpowered, ccp should make target painter, sensor dampener, and target painter burst modules. the sensor booster ones will need to have a very big range (>40km) to be useful, though.-vag"
6/11/2010,"1) you've already made a thread on this topic. like three days ago. 2) ecm bursts don't make anything overpowered. 3) you can't even keep your names straight from one word to the next. 4) tp and td bursts, even if they were created, would have zero game effect. they're continuous effects by nature, hey just don't work instantaneously. 5) sd bursts could work in theory, but they'd have the absurd effect of being more powerful the farther away you are. that's essentially impossible to balance. 6) please go away..."
6/11/2010,"i moved missioning corps recently, so i am working on grinding up standings. while blitzing a level 3, i noticed this shield, under the name on ""powerful em force field"". compared with the current pos shields, i think this one looks much better. as this is the only mission, or indeed anywhere, that i have ever seen this force field type, i think it's fair to say it's ""wow"" factor is clearly lost. what i propose is a simple database swap which will replace the pos shields with this one. and completely get rid of the old effect. i don't like it. and neither does anyone in my corp, once they see this one. if anything, get rid of the bars and replace it with the other effect.bad pictures courtesy of me."
6/11/2010,"that effect would make it harder to see inside the tower, and after a week of it being the default effect, you'd be just as bored of it as you are of the current effect."

6/11/2010,"pi is a very interesting and useful feature i am enjoying it but there seems to be a few issues which will help make it a little more workable after ofc the npc orders are removed.1. ability to move command centres already deployed on planets without moving, this can be done with an isk charge ofc but it would be nice to have your commands moved to where you see fit in case you wish to change your primary extraction2. ability to upgrade commands, i really hate the idea of destroying command centre just to place a higher level one only to route / link and deploy again, it wastes time, isk and kills the whole network3. must be near a planet in order to deploy a command centre, i find it odd how i can deploy a building on a planet 16 au away, tbh i think this is a bug as it is wrong in everyway. take this for example jump in a system move to gate you jumped from deploy commands jump out careless of range of the planets4. corporate interaction, there needs to be some way to have pi corporate so people can actually benefit from being a lets say pi only corp, not just about trading goods but corporate links much like when you can launch a pos for corp / alliance.5. building / link overview, it is pretty obvious what is on a planet and what you have deployed but for better management i say we have a building / link overview which shows current extractions and all other useful information.6. power reduction of storage centres, there isnt much of a need to have a storage centre atm a space port uses the same power has a better use and only costs a few more cpu7. expediting needs a buff, right now you dont need to expedite anything, the only use i have seen it for is if you are in a hostile situation where you cant collect goods and you need to 'store' items but then it is easier to just launch goods instead.theres also some extra buildings which i feel may be of some use and will make pi different for everyone, these will be used in ways of add ons and have their own risks. the risks will increase power cost / cpu cost / duration of extraction / storage amount etc they can only be attached to current buildings in forms of upgrades."

6/11/2010,"time for you to go hide with the rest of the other wrong people who came here and realised that their own arguments fall into irrelevance when challenged.ok, so now you're saying there is no infinity dollars awaiting to end eve. have you spoken to the other bitter old vets? they seem to think there is. anyhow, so you say people are already buying capitals via rl cash, and they can already buy as many capital pilots and capitals as they like. with ""disposable"" income.ok, so there's a demographic out there who are apparently doing this. and eve isn't dying. so how will it die if they buy there characters from ccp instead of buying them from other bitter old vets?i mean, you're the one that said ""wave bye bye to eve"". what did you mean by that? why would this group of evil, dirty, no good, scheming vermin of moderate income, suddenly decide they're going to destroy eve the moment ccp sell characters instead of bitter old veterans?perhaps if you put a bit more time and effort into bizarre rationales that have no basis outside of your fantasy world instead of telling me i should spend more time in your fantasy world of make believe?maybe then would stop inventing demons that do not exist.try thinking up actual good, honest reasons why ccp shouldn't do it.hell, i listed enough of them to help out the mouth foamers, they didn't want them. here's another for free:-the sp you buy on the character bazaar has already been bought from ccp once, and ccp get $20 for basically nothing each time it gets transferred, so they're getting payment for the same corporate activity twice instead of having the overhead of additional characters and account.here's more, if somebody buys a character off the bazaar, they may start a new account to api-key hide it from whatever nefarious activity they intend for it, netting ccp even more, whereas they might not have done had they been expected to wait for yet-another-year of their finite life time to get that skilled pilot.want another?people farming isk to buy characters are still paying for the character because they can't farm isk without giving ccp money, so ccp are again covertly selling the character themselves directly indirectly.but all those are as much arguements for as against, ccp are already selling the characters, just they've selected to sell the same name twice instead selling a new name. it's just a choice they made, either was fine and changed basically nothing, especially now we have plex.but hey, you feel good pretending to be absolutely right without offering anything that makes sense... you should keep that up, especially with cool statements like sp is not destructable. you know... i can think of two ways to destroy it. but so can you, so i really don't know why you said it.you also said stfu. which means shut the **** up. which in this case means ""i came here expecting to be right, and it didn't work out that way, i will now swear at you because it validates everything i just said so eloquently"".raise your game."

6/11/2010,"the current system is that a pi player chooses to have the planet be mined for 5 hours, 23 hours, or 3 days. the problem with this is that it makes it too repetative and has a huge difference in gains. i.e. the 23 hour routine makes 3x as much as the 3 day. i propose that the planet mining system be switched to be similar to the pos system, where a miner works until the cargohold it is told to distribute to is full.also, to nerf planet macro users, the 5 hour, 23 hour, or 3 day choices should be removed and the mine once every hour option (similar to moons) should be the only thing that planet mining buildings can do.pros: it would make the storage buildings actually useful.it would free up planet industry players to be able to visit systems far away from their planet or to be offline for about a week or two without their planet going haywire.level the playing field between macros using 5 hours constantly and players logging in once a day.cons:players that wish to do only planet industry may feel nerfedpossible programing bugs. i.e. only space for 1 mineral is available and 2 modules finish at the same time dumping minerals into the storage bin."
6/11/2010,"they designed pi to be a high-workload system. it's supposed to suck. i hate it, but you're not going to get them to change one of the fundamental design decisions."
6/11/2010,"suggestion for pi improvement: allow players to logically remove power and cpu from existing structures and links. removing power and cpu costs nothing while bringing things back on line takes isk. by 'logically' i mean if a mid link or structure is deactivated, everything tied in upstream is also deactivated.i'm guessing most player's colonies are extracting several materials at once and running mutliple factories. being able to manage the cpu and power usage without having to deconstruct would allow a more efficient use of factories and extractors. as the market shifts production for one material can be decreased or shut down altogether and production ramped up for a different material."

6/11/2010,"tyrannis broke the smuggling mechanics.as a full time smuggler i make my entire living in eve moving contraband of various sorts. the profit margins are always awful sales very slow and my personal capitalization almost non existent, but this mini-profession has been a way of life for me and my primary source for income. i do all my work with my main as it should be.since tryannis i have been absolutely wholloped by customs. to put it in perspective, i have traveled through thousands of gates with contraband and received only a few fines in a smuggling fit frig. after the patch, i did an 18 jump trip and received 6 fines totaling 12misk + standings penalty. after posting on si i was able to confirm something broke in the smuggling mechanic.what people tend to forget about smuggling is this, if the consumer can not move their purchase from a station, the product will not sell at all. i am aware of more exotic ways to smuggle boosters in high sec. but it is absurd to expect casual booster users to go through the same ritual in order to get the boosters from a trade hub to its final destination.unless something changes i predict the booster market will crash any day. as for my profession...i am looking for any support to get this fixed."

6/12/2010,"i have 0 experience with low sec and null sec mag sites, so can't say anything about those.however, i do agree that in high sec, the mag sites compared to the other sites are worthless.a decent radar site is worth around 10m, a grav site can be ok, though still not as good as simply mining high sec minerals, but that's just because the low-sec minerals aren't worth enough, there's plenty of value in the sites themselves quantatively, i've never found a ladar site in high sec, i am assuming they only spawn in low/null-sec and w-space.w-space is a totally different story, because everything that drops in there is in some way part of making t3 components, so they all have their values and uses. right now, a high sec radar site is worth next to nothing, especially if you compare the time you need to find and clean it out, a level 1 mission, or a run into a 1/10 plex will get you better results.buffing up mag sites in high sec a little so they are more in line with the others would be very good for my favorite profession."

6/12/2010,"if this is true, it's absolutely stupid. it should cause a -sec penalty, not a -faction. seems like it's an obvious coding glitch that i hope ccp will correct."
6/12/2010,that gm obviously doesn't understand what you are concerned about. reply to the petition stating that you completely understand and agree with the standings loss towards concord (which is what you get when you rep an outlaw) but that the standings loss to amarr empire shouldn't have anything to do with the repair recipient being an outlaw or not.i do have a quick question though; do you receive the same standings loss for repairing a non-outlaw militia member? if you don't then it makes no sense whatsoever to lose empire standings for repairing an outlaw in the militia.
6/12/2010,one of many fixes needed for fw.
6/12/2010,"as someone who has watched his amarr faction standing tumble from above 8 to less than 2, i fully support the op. also, there is no way to regain faction standing in fw, so they get you from both sides."
6/12/2010,"it is the derivate modifier effect: you lose standing with concord, concord has positive standing with all the empire faction, so when you lose standing with concord you lose standing with all the different faction (or at least you should lose standing with them).if it happen only when you are part of the militia or only with one of the different faction it is broken and a bug. if it happen every time you remote rep any outlaw even if you are both outside the militia it is working has intended. changing that so that it will not happen when you are both in a militia corp, while doing militia things but it work when the outlaw is attacking non-militia targets would be a very hard thing to code and seeing how smaller changes in the standing checks in the past had large negative effects increasing lag in fleets i think that implementing the needed checks to avoid this kind of problem will seriously increase lag. can someone confirm that this kind of loss happen only when you are in the militia and it don't happen if you are outside it?"
6/12/2010,"venkul, i can confirm i never recieved any faction standing hits before my corp joined the militia. besides, your arument makes no sense, because if these were derived standing modifications they would show up in the logs as such. but the logs do not state ""derived mofification"", they state: ""assistance to enemy of amarr empire""."

6/12/2010,"if anyone at ccp ever reads these. i have read the q1 report and the cormarant is one of the most flown ships. maybe ccp should look at how they are being used? i would bet most of them are salvagers. is this the designed purpose of the ""frigate killer"". lol maybe is is time to fix the ship class? at last? i fly 4 on two accounts and all they do is loot and salvage. i would never take on into combat. i fly frigs in fw and bcs in 0.0. is there a problem here?"
6/12/2010,"first off, make it easier on us... rsi are not fun, and ever more often eve goes further and further toward the clickfest of a browser game.a) - have a survey all button!!! this would survey all current non-harvesting extractors. the results are not shown, only the option to set 30m, 5/24/96 hour options for every extractor that's not extracting at the moment. optionally allow surveying only selected extractors. any extractors without routed product would start to flash (or do something unmistakably visible) so we know where to look to fix the problem.this will save our poor hands!!!b) extractors auto-survey for the love of everything... they have no other function!!!. at least have them automatically survey when selected!!! one less click is a win for everyone!c) - cancel job. pretty simple, allows you to shut down the current operation (loosing whatever it was doing, just like pos), and let you start a new operation. this would be big win when you accidentally select an extraction duration you didn't want.d) - logistic handling facility. manages storage arrays that are routed through it, becoming the 'master storage' capacity. linked storage arrays (you still need them) are then simply used as a single bulk raw capacity with the handling facility showing total capacity in use. you can then link from the handling facility to your assemblers. individual storage arrays can still be used along the routes from extractors, but will not benefit from the handling facility. powergrid usage of linked storage arrays are halved through the handling array. costs are the same to build & link.e) - upgrade control center. you pay the market price for a new control center, but upgrade it on-site without having to rip out the entire network. due to paying full price for the upgrade it's not going to be cost effective to install lesser centers and build them up, but if your skills only allowed standard and you can now use advanced you should be able to upgrade on-site.f) - corporate links. special links that go from your control center or launch pad to the control/pad of a fellow corporation member. isk costs are four times as much as a standard link to install or upgrade and are paid by the corporation creating them. link pg/cpu load is shared equally between the command centers. alternatively introduce a corporate logistics handling facility through which product can be routed. identical storage quantity to a launch pad, but half the cost and fitting load (as it lacks the ability to launch product).g) - alliance links. these require a special facility: alliance planetary logistics center. this facility can only install alliance resource storage arrays that hold 20k m/3 per (they cannot install launch pads, nor launch product themselves or support assembly or extractor arrays). these links cost 10x the isk of standard links to install/upgrade and are paid by the corporation making the link. they draw 3x as much pg/cpu. routing materials through alliance links incurs the standard material transfer cost (as if you launched product from a launch pad), but 50% of it goes to the controlling alliance. link pg/cpu load is taken from the alliance center."

6/12/2010,"oh god liangs scorp change is the only thing that even came close to making any sense but no. you can't get close to t2 ecm bonuses for a t1 ship. you will have to keep the sub par strength bonus. hell, i think dropping the strength bonus all together, buffing the range bonus and giving it a launcher rof bonus with a 5th launcher is better. pushing its range out to where the other two bs's are designed to operate (>200km) makes more sense.edit: actually scrub that (just had a play in eft). scorp can already get around 200 km ecm range (50% fall off though) without implants which is acceptable at these ranges. scorpion in its current form is a very good ship. the other races do not need an ewar (t1)bs."

6/13/2010,"learning skills are a viable tactic in determining the ability of a pesron to allocate skills in a realistic and game changing way. whether or not people choose to train them will either better or worsen their experience to eve. the remap feature along with implants make these skills optional to train; however, beneficial if trained early. this is a benefit to the game. this topic is not supported. learning skills add a significant feature to the game."
6/13/2010,they are stupid.every one who has sp in them should have it refunded onto their training que.all characters existing and new should then have the maximum potential attributes for their bloodline and what the current learning skills would have added.simple. end of talk should just be done.no one can really argue. people without them now get the bonus. people with them get keep their sp and maybe get to fly a new ship or sumthing.they add nothing to the game. the player picks the skills he learns and thus the effectivness of his overal characters specilization. the learning skills themself simply determine the rate he heads down the road. as a veteran i do not hugely care if i do not get the sp i have invested in learningskills. i do beleive that it makes sense to reimburse but i also beleive that the learning skills should be removed more.
6/13/2010,"learning skills basically look like a tacky facebook game feature, like paying money for extra turns.a new player doesn't know what the full skill tree looks like. generally, before research, players will assume after seeing the second tier that there is probably additional skills beyond the 11 that actually exist, and don't put much more thought into the game after that."

6/13/2010,"so you have a habit of not reading fine print carefully? that is so nice, do you want me to sell you a half-brick... er, a house?"
6/13/2010,or you just go to the market settings and configure it properly. not supported scamming is part of the game and stupidity should be punished.
6/13/2010,ccp has no obligation to protect people from their own incompetence or lack of common sense.caveat emptor.
6/13/2010,this proposal is against people spamming scams. therefore supported.
6/13/2010,"er, no it isn't."
6/13/2010,"fine-print??? the only thing you have to look at the market is item's price. if you fail to do that you deserve to be punished for it.a) you really don't see how this could be easily exploitable?b) sure.. something like: this item costs ""one billion two hundred and twenty five million nine hundred seventy eight thousand three hundred and twenty four point eighty two isk""... i see how this can be very helpful.not supported."
6/13/2010,sounds reasonable.
6/13/2010,"this idea is simple, but i feel it will go a long way towards more dynamic 0.0 warfare. as most of us know, poss have a large amount of health. i propose that this amount of health should be reduced, substantially. in order to compensate, pos resistances should be increased to bring the ehp of poss near but somewhat below it's previous levels. this change reduces the amount of time required for a fleet of battleships or dreadnoughts to destroy a pos. however, this change does allow defenders to repair their poss faster, which means less time spent sitting around with a rack of remote repairs. this change also makes a guarded pos substantially harder to capture, while shortening the time sink that results when an alliance starts burning through unguarded poss.clarification - by pos i mean any player structure with a large amount of hps related to sovereignty or 0.0 warfare.in sum:poss lose actual hp but gain larger resistances, making it easier to repair them out of combat.poss lose overall ehp making it easier for a fleet to burn through them while unguarded.poss become harder to take while guarded, because remote repairs have a larger effect due to the higher resistances.this encourages - fighting over poss, while discouraging focusing on a single location over others, because the effect of both actual attack and actual defense are magnified. while massive fleet fights and heavy latency can and will still result, the choice belongs to the attacker; they can either split their fleet to send many bases into reinforced mode in a shorter timeframe than they currently could, or form a massive blob to wipe out bases one at a time and hopefully encounter the blob formed by the defenders in response. defenders are now encouraged to meet the attackers, either with smaller gangs and repairs on many bases at once, or by blobbing their blob. this gives the attacker another tactical tool and gives them more control over where fighting happens; and makes the results of fights over poss depend more heavily on players and fleets than afk-bashing capabilities."
6/13/2010,"the proper fix, would be to triple hit points. and increase resists. making it harder for poss to be destroyed, and take longer for them to be repaired."
6/13/2010,"not to be inflammatory, but why? more hp would mean more afk-ops, more incentive to drop poss like candy, and less sleep during wars."
6/13/2010,"not crazy, but really, why is the rr side of thing privileged over the dps side? it's not like we don't have to sit there forever with a rack of guns. -17/10."
6/13/2010,"encouraging rr encourages fights, since you can't rep from inside the pos shields. that's another idea, perhaps require ships to be further than 2km away from the pos shield to activate rr modules? that could help with the bubble games."
6/13/2010,not supported.
6/13/2010,"active tanking is a joke im thinking it is only useful in missions or with caps so i have a solution that will make active tanking worth having without nerfing passive tanking or buffing mission boats.active tanking modules will use charges and no longer have any affect on cap, based on the size they will hold a certain amount of charges (similar to cap boosters). when a pilot activates a module the amount of damage they received will be taken from charges however there will be a set cap based on size.the duration of repping however will be significantly reduced and if theres no charges you wont be able to repairthis will work much like a cap booster but will hold more the duration will be significantly reduced meaning more repairs but dependant on charges, this will increase your overall defence but since theres a duration on repairs it will be brokenpassive will still be viable and ships with repper bonuses will greatly benefit from this, modules in high slots used to repair other pilots wont be affected by this.the problem i see with active tanking is, you cant really buff it without indirectly buffing mission running so lets change it to make it a little more workable and allow players to actively manage repairing"
6/13/2010,"first ideas go in f&id, then they go to assembly hall."
6/13/2010,"anything that would make active tanking competitive with passive tanking in large fights would make it completely overpowered for solo and small gang combat. for smaller engagements, active tanking is already very strong if used by a competent pilot."
6/13/2010,"so in other words, you want to make missions unplayable, small-gang pvp a joke, and keep active tanking worthless in fleet fights. brilliant!"
6/13/2010,"look at the boosters and their uses, the common used boosters are blue pill and exile, gases for them are hold by ""bloc"" factions (foutain/venal) and wars were never declared for the holding of the clouds but for moon's rarity mainly.now, even for a really good smuggler not affilited with those factions, it's hard to get those cyto's gases back to empire. i think the cosmos contellations should be reworkedo7"

6/14/2010,i agree that plexes need to spawn much more often throughout the day. but you say we need to remove the ewar from the npcs. (you say this will balance the npcs  i have my doubts but maybe your right) i just dont see why we have npcs at all. to the extent they have an effect on the pvp fights its a negative effect. removing npcs will balance things wont it? what do you think of the idea of letting militias know where and when a plex is entered? i suppose this is the biggest change of my proposal. its not really a big change. its just an improvement to help pvpers get fights faster. no more wandering around hoping to find someone in a plex that wont immediately warp off. you can have plexes all over but to the extent you have npcs in the plexes people will need to pve their fits. and if we dont know where they are that means we do a lot of roaming around for nothing.

6/14/2010,"1. by your logic, if even high sec pvp is suicide, then bringing a ship into low sec and especially 0.0 wouldn't be any safer, especially to warrant a payout.2. no--what u want is to introduce is a nerf to suicide ganking in the disguise of anti-insurance fraud, while at the same time, proposing a loophole for corpmates to kill each other for insurance... and the best part? u think that's gonna get ppl to hold your hand when they can use alts... 3. with your flimsy excuses, this goes back to my previous #3, despite what u say, especially since u claim it does not affect u in any way."
6/14/2010,"1. i never said highsec pvp is suicide, ""suicide"" ganking however is. are you honestly saying that bringing a ship into lowsec or 0.0 is just as dangerous as a 100% certainty of death by concord?2. yes i want another nerf to suicide ganking as promised by ccp, did i ever deny that? i want to up the ante, and if someone then still feels it warranted to suicide gank a low value cargo/ship, then so be it. 3. well it does affect me when i cruise around in highsec of course, it is not because i live in lowsec that i never visit the big city :p"

6/14/2010,"see, the overall impact of this is actually pretty small. in 0.0, it mostly impacts people that are ratting in a system and then attack someone - and then run away and afk cloak. if someone sits there extending the aggression counter there's a small chance that the original party will log out for some reason leaving him open to be scanned out. in low sec, the same risk exists but there's stations everywhere and someone will just dock in one of them. no, the problem is most evident for people that rely on concord to protect their mission. move to low sec and just blow him up when he enters your mission.this is really an extremely small 'issue' - and in reality the only real issue here is that the aggression counter isn't visibly renewed for both parties. that's it. aggression should be renewed by any hostile action by either party.-liang"

6/14/2010,"if its destroyable by a small gang in 5-10 min it should have a value listed in few k isk and drop nothingat 10-30mil thats like the total pi output of a single player across a couple of worlds for a few days, no just no, your clearly looking for quick and easy profit (the drops into acan suggestion) without having to work at it at all, if the cargolink/customs office became a targetable vulnerable object it would have to be tanked along the lines of an ihub (well maybe 1/2 to 1/10 as tough) otherwise pi would be impossible in low and null sec as any ass and his three mates in bc's could disrupt a whole constellation in an hour,this is the whole reason why pos/station/ihubs have reinforcement timers, huge hp etc etc, so a small band of ****s cant massivly impact the income of a corp/alliance etc without actually having to work for their win, and then expecting loot out of the deal as well thats just pure greed,besides without all them high extraction rate worlds in low and null sec importing up to empire building anything up here where extractors are near useless will be impossible,"
6/14/2010,"most people, don't anything lying around in the cargo link 23/7, there simply is not point in doing that. therefore, the only point of blowing it up is to disrupt enemy operation, as it will give nearly nothing of value. alright, so suppose we give it more hp, let it last 15-20 minutes. it's not suppose to take as much effort as it takes to sieghe a pos, it's just freaking 10 mill, my pi system produces more then that in one day. ok let's say we make it cost less."
6/14/2010,no. defiantly not we dont even know if pi will be hugely profitable yet and wardeccing in highsec is stupid enough as it is since its next to free under all situations don't encourage it
6/14/2010,actually hp and prices are barely relevant. you still can't counteract such attack without being online 23/7. which is unrealistic to say the least.
6/14/2010,"because this clearly makes sense, and obviously places vulnerable to attack would never ever equip them selves with a means of active defense. more hp is clearly the answer.also severing links is a huge disruption at no cost to the attacker (in your proposal), it'd be less disrupting to shoot extractors. ...wait, what are you referring to when you say ""links""? because re-reading that last bit you are not using the term in the same way the game is."
6/14/2010,"wth? who is talking about links? that hangar in the orbit is what i whant to make destructable.i am doing pi, it made profit.and how is it relevant to highsec and wardecs again? in high-sec, the cargo links belong to the owner of the planet, the empire, i doubt concord will like you shooting the cargo links. now that's a thought, give it a couple of guns? should we?"
6/14/2010,"yeah but prices in empire are highly inflated because noone really knows how much pi is worth, someone is buying industrial fibers for like 4k each, as it takes something like 8000 to make an ihub worth 500mil (someone threw that number at me and i havnt checked it but its probably not far off) your looking at 32million for one component of which you will need similar volumes maybe a dozen or so more at that rate your not going to make a profit with all the other materials considered,,,,cap parts,,,,, etcwhen the npc seeded market starts to dry thats when planets will settle into their real value and until then going oh yeah 10 mil is nothing for a planet is a joke(i will admit i havnt actually done the math and trusted someone else's bucket maths)and even if your right and you can make 10mil a day per player per planet,at 15 min to kill in null sec them alliances will be replacing their customs offices every 2-3hrs, and like i said i want to see minerals coming to jita so to hell with that,and lowsec would possibly become lost offices per hour"
6/14/2010,"problem with destroyers is their intended role can be filled with better ships that take (approximately) the same training time.they need a total rework tbh, from damage output, to tanking abilities. i know that i can run a cormorant in a lvl 2 and low level 3's with ease, but with 3's its much more effecient to run with a drake (or even a cruiser)other than that, what they need to do is redefine the role of a destroyer. also would it be too much to ask for another t2 destroyer, the salvage ship? ;)"
6/14/2010,"there's more to eve than mission running. having said that, the thrasher is a good ship, but the other three have anemic slot layouts.there needs to be a rework, but i can't support an empty post like that."
6/14/2010,"sorry for the ""empty post"". i have read several threads here about them but i have yet to see any action from ccp about them. after reading the quarterly report i am a little concerned that when the people at ccp read it they will say. ""see nothing wrong with the destroyer, look at how many are being flown"". i am merely hoping to get them to look at how they are being used as opposed to the stated purpose of the ship. if they do that then maybe they will look at that very good thread and even give us a t2 salvager in the process."
6/14/2010,"quick research on bc (yeah, i know, but it's the best i can be bothered to do right now) suggests that more ruptures are used in pvp than destroyers of any nature.that shows that something is truly messed up somewhere."
6/14/2010,"a-e, definitely yes. f-g are arguable, but i think that something in that vein would be reasonable."
6/14/2010,"same opinioni don't really care about corp links, but something to make easier the surveying and the linkage, and an option to upgrade cc are really needed.what you want with the click is that we are here. it's only a way to make the 30mn cycle something we won't use a lot.the clickfest itself is not needed by the gameplay.give us at least an option to choose a timer for all extractors, and don't have to choose it each time, that's really painfull.i want 23h cycle, i won't choose something else, so add a button somewhere"
6/14/2010,i'm assuming the ability to select groups of extractors (and storage facilities) with the shift key comes in with this. me and the rest of my corp (consisting of another player and our alts) support these ideas.especially the first one.my clicking finger! it hurts!
6/14/2010,absolutely! these suggestions are just basic functionality.
6/14/2010,"supported. as it is, fw is just a money sink with no rewards. why take the risk if the rewards aren't there? how will fw take off if there is no real incentive to join? in particular, i support the idea of rewarding fw more (and differently than how l4 missions are rewarded), and add global rewards for the whole militia (special advantages in the occupied territories, perhaps?)"
6/14/2010,"thats because occupancy is mainly a pve activity as fw is currently set up. get in your pve fit run timers and if someone happens to stumble on you warp out. the occupancy mechanics have no decent reward (pay less per hour than many other activities) and doing them is not fun. if they were fun to do people would do them even though they don't pay well. indeed, pvp doesnt pay well but its fun.i think this thread demonstrates why ccp is not taking any action on fw. players, really don't agree on basic things eg., should occupancy be pve or pvp; should occupancy have larger consequences etc. and the bugs involve an activity that very few people engage in because it is not fun or rewarding. so really until the players can come up with some clear ideas on what they want why should ccp mess with it?"
6/14/2010,why don't they use existing models and just set where the missiles originate on models that have what look like missile launchers.
6/14/2010,"if they did this, they would also have to adjust the velocity of every missile fired out of each launcher on a ship. the reason for this is that if you're firing a salvo at the edge of your effective range, you'd end up with some missiles stopping short simply because they were fired from a launcher sitting further from the target than the others. of course, adjusting the velocity doesn't solve the problem entirely either. you might end up with a scenario where you launch missiles at a target, their velocities are adjusted accordingly, and then the target zooms past you, meaning the slower missiles that were closer to the target are now further away, resulting in them missing while the faster missiles hit. this is an extreme case, but it's still something that has to be considered.turrets work fine because their range from the target is actually calculated from the center of the ship, just like how missiles are currently launched. the turrets that you see are merely eye candy."
6/14/2010,"uhh malcolm, who said the missile graphics have to be anything more than the ""current eye candy"" turret graphics? he was talking about graphics, not mechanics. i think you thought a little too much on that one when u started talking about changing missile velocity./support, fix the eyecandy factor. looks terrible having missiles fly out from the center of my ship from a hole that doesnt exist"

6/14/2010,"rather than a new ship, bumping in general would be nice to be able to cause damage.on a funn side note about bumping, 'the orca that never made it':a bunch of pirates were attacking one of our alliance member's posses in w-space, me and a couple of them were somewhere in the fights, sitting at the high sec side of the wh entrance to the system, several of our enemies entered the system, and also were sitting there.. then they bring in an orca.since we're in high-sec, just opening fire wouldn't do.. hence, we decided on a different tactic, denial.flying at the orca and bumping over and over and over again, keeping it away from the entry point as long as possible.took the orca pilot a good while before he finally got himself into the wh.i still wonder what they would be saying to eachother on vent when they figure out what we were doing."

6/14/2010,"whats this about not wanting ccp to devote time to this and spend time on better things? if ccp was to do this, there would be a fair number of people doing it, and i said make it a payable change, which means, more money to fund the things you say they should spend time on. out of 900,000 accounts, how much money would u think an account service like this would ring in? which as i said, more money = better products."
6/14/2010,"on behalf of the playerbase, would the csm be so kind as to ask our developers to give us an update to the development and drawingboard notes? in developmentthe drawingboardmany of the requests harped upon in the assembly hall have been on these lists since 2008. where do these items sit in the production backlog presently?"

6/14/2010,what is wrong with frigates is that the bridge doesn't come with a pre-installed beer fridge and a pole for the exotic dancers. :d
6/14/2010,"clone costs, i cant fly frigs as my clone costs 30 mill or somethign stupid :("
6/14/2010,this is probably the only good argument against frigs in the whole thread. frigates are not cost effective for combat when you take into account the cost of replacing a lost clone on a high sp toon.
6/15/2010,"omfg yes ill support this.when i first started this game 2 1/2 years ago, i thought to myself ""cool players can own stations"".when i saw what ""stations"" were in videos, little boxes tethered by strings taht you drive up to like some kind of inner city mcdonalds, i was disgusted at the fail of it all.please actually make poses haev a look liek a real space station, like the npc ones."
6/15/2010,"1ekrid1, you're confusing poses with player stations, and no, they aren't the same thing. the player-owned npc-style stations you're thinking of do exist, and they can be found throughout 0.0 space. head out there sometime and check it out, although you probably won't have docking rights unless you're friendly with the owning alliance.that doesn't change the fact that poses still need an overhaul."

6/15/2010,"dominion was pretty much a toy for us nullsec'ers to play with, while id love to see some of your proposed updates zerolag is a technical impossibility due to the perversity of people, taking jita the ur-example, jita can handle 500, 600 want to go there lag, it is upgraded to take 700 (thinking ahead to add redundancy) because its now awesome 1000 turn up, devs headdesk round about there,that said post dominion and now post tyrannis us nullsec'ers are noticing increasing lag and inability of the server to handle small fleets moving,the most egregious example i can think of was a gang of about 30 of us planning a long roam, heading over two regions from our home, in the region next door, in almost empty systems, in a quiet region with nothing in that region or nearish using a jb we were creating the kind of lag and jump delays i used to attribute to a 150man fleet moving around"
6/15/2010,"instead of boosting blasters i'm saying it's a good thing that weapon systems for different races has advantages/disadvantages like dps, rof, falloff, optimal. this game would be pretty boring if only the name and the damage type would be different for all races.clearly you need the balance these weapon systems tho. instead of boosting the falloff and optimal of blasters, i think the ship platforms themselves should be changed. for example the typical blaster ship hulls like thorax, brutix, megathron and hyperion and their t2/faction variants should get a 25% base speed bonus, so you still need to get within point blank range to cause a lot of damage, but with a faster ship u would have the chance to do it.nowadays it's really not a wise thing to pick up a fight for an astarte with a sleipnir, because u wont stand a chance to get in range in time. the same applies for fleet fights, for example 10 cyclones would simply **** 10 brutixes in no time because the brutixes would spend the most of their time by chasing down their targets instead of shooting them.it's pretty abnormal that i have to use acs on gallente ships, since they're better even without the ship bonuses."

6/15/2010,"here's another annoying little item.let's say you have two processors that both need a resource, and are both fed from the same source (an extractor or storage).when more resources become available, it apparently goes to a processor at random (it may be using some internal order). what it should do is preferentially fill the processor that already has the most resources.in other words, let's say the processors need 40 units of reactive metals. one currently has 20, and the other 0. now 20 more units become available. those 20 units should go to the processor that already has 20, so that it is completely ready to go.as it stands now, the new resources will often go to the processor with 0 units, both become half-full, and both are stalled. in a complex, multistage pipeline, these pipeline stalls can add a couple of hours to a day-long precursor->final product run.more precisely, the rule should be:* when distributing resources, first fill the destinations that already are closest to being completely full.* if multiple destinations are equally full, fill the ones that are closest to being full with their other requirements. note that for a high-tech processor, a full-70%-40% would rank higher than a 90%-90%-40%, because the former would get filled to full-70%-full and be more likely to get filled up and start running faster."

6/15/2010,"1. i give up, and agree we disagree.2. it is about risk vs reward, i want more risk for suicide gankers, just as i think that moving level 5 missions to lowsec was a good move ( fix or nerf, whatever you call it ). however when people start to kill, for example hulks, just for fun, then the price for suicide ganks has to go up. it has gone up, but not enough imho.3. i am not scared of death, and take calculated risks when hauling stuff from empire to lowsec or back. thing is, i really don't have to carry high value cargo, because people do it for fun.what i ask for is the implementation of ccp's promise :"
6/15/2010,"1. fair enough.2. ahh so it is about exhumers too?

6/15/2010,as one of maybe 3 people with the purchasing power to actually buy an aeon if i wanted in this thread i agree with the op. the aeon is by far the ugliest of all capital ships with its half built bestower looks. i don't know of anyone who owns an aeon that actually likes it's look. i know of quite a few people who go so far as to train a completely different racial carrier just so they can buy something that isn't an aeon.
6/15/2010,aeon deserves better. there are people that train for nyx instead of aeon simply because the aeon looks silly. those people also prefer the stats of the aeon.please make the aeon look like something i want to fly instead of just something that sounds like i want to fly.
6/15/2010,looks like i forgot to support my topic.
6/15/2010,"just to clarify, the op is not wanting to change how aggression works, only how the timer is shown (or not). also, as i understand it, this is what liang is suggesting - the timer needs to be accurate.i would have to agree. the aggression timer needs to show whether aggression can legally happen between two players. it's that simple.regardless of how or why or whether it's fair that the aggression timer changes, it is critical that the player is given the correct information about aggression so that they are able to make choices. sid meier defines a game as ""a series of interesting choices"". the choices aren't so interesting if you are given false information to base them on."
6/15/2010,semi-correct.the main point is the visibility of the timer.however... to me it is exploitative to be able to extend that timer without restraint by shooting wrecks. i would hardly consider that an act of aggression as its just a pile of trash.but yes... the timer visibility is the main issue.
6/15/2010,one could similarly argue that you shouldn't get a timer just because someone shot you. that's equally as wrong.-liang
6/15/2010,"as near as i can tell, the lachesis is the only ship in the game to have a heavy missile bonus but not a ham bonus (although the sacrilege gets a ham bonus but no heavy missile bonus). note that the huginn, which also has split weapons systems and gets a missile launcher rof bonus, gets a bonus to hams as well. all this just makes me suspect that ccp forgot to update the lachesis's bonus when hams were introduced. unless someone has a reason why this would be game-breaking, i think this should finally be fixed."
6/15/2010,"kk so this hole thing is based on risk v reward right. thats what i get from most of the posters. now low sec people are always tring to claim there is no risk in runing missions so the good paying ones should be in low sec to inc the risk becouse there is no risk in runing high sec missions.then your going to love this. i just wish they had one for all ships and not just tech 3. but we will use what they give us.first quarterly economic newsletter of 2010 security group counthigh sec 1,228pve 964pvp 264low sec 601pve 75pvp 526null sec 1,514pve 449pvp 1,065wormhole space 680pve 283pvp 397total 4,023now if we look at the high sec will see that 964 ships were lost in pve and that in low sec only 526 ships were lost in pvp. i think thats a clear and cut case of high sec ;mission runers lossing more ship in pve in high sec with out help dieing then ships were lost in low sec to pvp.so clearly level 5 missions should be in high sec becouse the greater risk is in losing a ship in a mission in high sec.plz keep in mind this are just tech 3 ships only there is no telling out many ships are realy lost in high sec missions verses low sec pvp. but people were using them for both here and they are the best ships out there right now that are not capitol class ships. originally by: vaerah vahrokha-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- quote:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------nice troll though, i'll give it an 8/10.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------i have the foul feeling he was not trolling so, op, if you lose 1000 ships in hi sec with i.e. a 200k player base in hi sec and you lose 500 ships in low sec with a 20k player base, you say hi sec is riskier? for real?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------let me just copy/past this one too man i could probly copy/past this for every low sec reply as its going to be the numbers now matter as there reply.you see people this is how low sec crys about high sec and mission running. first they cry for mons that there is no risk no ship loss in high sec pveing. and we the high sec pve's cry that were the larger crowed so give them to us.and they say the larger number do's not mean anything.and now we show that more ships are lost to high sec pve then to low sec pvp and now there cry the numbers matter the numbers! wtf man is it just me or is he crying the same thing that they told us did not matter?"
6/15/2010,supporting my own ideal
6/15/2010,this has to be the most ******ed logic i've seen in a long time. you have to be trolling. no person could possibly seriously think like this.
6/15/2010,damn just flaming here any logic you got pointing to my ******ed logic?
6/15/2010,"i'm not him, but i can give you some logic.first, there are more people in high sec. lets say that these is 10x more people in high sec than low sec (i really don't know, but there are probably more than that) so if the number was equal, it looks to be like... um... 964 vs. 5260... that's more than 5x less in high sec.second, you are comparing pve to pvp, when they are two seperate things... and the number of ships dieing in pve will remain, no matter what system you are in, if you have enough people running missions. so if you add the added risk of pvp ontop of that pve, you get 964+526, which is 1490... and you get 964 vs. 1490... again high sec wins on lowest losses."
6/15/2010,kk then by your logic we should look at the big pic right. so lets take this game wide not just high sec low sec but game wide.pve loses 1771 or 44.02%pvp loses 2252 or 55.98%so game wide there is close to a 10% higher chance of lossing a pvp ship then there is a pve ship.and the highest level of pve is in wh and null sec and pays alot better then level 5's. but low sec should have something more profitalbe then high sec so what do they have that high sec dont. o ya moon mining/capitals better belts. better q level mission givers and lower sec states raising the pay outs of this missions. fw.so ya for a 10% diffence i do think high sec should have level 5 missions
6/15/2010,first off nooblet... whs has no bounties or awards... you have to haul out what you gather and its not as easy as it sounds.secondly... null sec has big rewards but at great risk/cost unless your a big fat alliance capable of holding your own space. (you ever been to null sec? help maintain an i-hub with sov bills? yeah right)it's quite obvious you have no ####ing idea what your talking about.your just trolling to be trolling.so please... go troll somewhere else and stop wasting everyone's time with broken logic.this reeks of bullcrap.
6/15/2010,ya i have done wh's low sec and null sec i have not done 0.0 but i just think low sec with better rewards and i'm probly not to far off. and becosue i have been in null sec is why i know what 10/10's pay out and how much better it pays. not even counting the faction loot or that you can use carryers do help with them.we dont pimp ride fraction bs in high sec level 5's for shi z and giggles its becouse we cant get carryers into high sec for the missions.secondly you loot your bountys in wh's they dont weigh much at all and pay good and good paying salvage too not like the crap salvage we get in high sec missions.null sec has lower risk and higher rewards then low sec. it is vastly easyer to lock a system down with cryo jammers and bubbles then how you have to do it in low sec.so plz dont try your low sec bs proaganda on me thx u have a nice day.edit: as a side note the time i spent in null sec was before the changes with help maintain an i-hub with sov bills? but i did not much like the blob then and probly will not like the blob now.
6/15/2010,i get what your saying here you got my support.
6/15/2010,"th155 already pointed out the most glaring errors. you are either intentionally misinterpreting the data to suit your goals or can't interpret it. either way it doesn't make for a convincing argument. you are also using just one ship type as an example. a ship type that is too expensive for most people to even use in pvp, so the numbers will naturally favor pve losses more than if the comparison would be done using another type of ship. the point is, that this info can't even be used to prove what you are trying to use it for.wait what? you have done null sec, but not 0.0? this is the problem right here. you either have serious issues expressing what you mean, make stuff up to sound like less of a noob or you are trolling on purpose.you are ignoring the fact, that it isn't easy to secure that space initially, it takes constant work and sacrifice to maintain and you still risk losing it at all times. usually so much work, that a small entity can't even hope to do it alone. even after you have locked down a system it doesn't offer protection, if you don't constantly defend it against intruders. 0.0 is also far more dangerous to move around in, since you can use bubbles there. just because you can achieve a position where most of your areas are protected and people can live there in relative peace, doesn't mean the risk and cost of 0.0 is any less. it just means, that your safety is earned by the work of others. the higher rewards are definitely warranted."
6/15/2010,"this thread is made of win, supporting and bumping just to see more posts."
6/15/2010,"your analysis proves nothing statistically, and if you think it does please post your proof.first flaw is that your sample is scewed beyond what any person would think is a correct sample of pve ships. instead of taking just t3, move to encompassing the entire population of pve losses and then provide the numbers of the amount of missions done in high-sec vs low-sec. you can even go as far as to give the amount of npc pirates/drones destroyed in each of those areas on a daily basis. then you numbers will more likely show that the opposite of what your arguing is true.the shear mass of pve ships and missions done in high-sec is staggering and the losses more than make up for the amount of completed missions. i say move lvl4's to systems bordering low-sec and have half of those missions be in those low-sec systems, or move them to low-sec all together. this is not a move more people to low-sec issue, it is based off of that same risk vs reward factor, you want more reward, take more risk.present your mathematical proof and the link to your statistics, proove me wrong with math, then i'll support this topic."
6/15/2010,"the main flaw is assuming that a loss pve is the only risk to a mission runnerquestion does a mission runner in lowsec who got scanned down and gang dropped by players count as a pvp loss or a pve one? if pvp then the lowsec risks are increased because the total loss is the risk to a mission runner becausein lowsec your pve ship might get caught by a roaming gang and ganked in pvp, similarly in null sec there is no neat line between pvp and pve, people loose hulks and ratting ravens too often due to rats jumping in, in high sec pve losses are in total the result of people not fitting their ship right and being killed by the rats,everywhere else this is not the only risk factor,by examining only one risk factor it screws the results to fit your assertion but all factors muct be accounted for (the numerical disparity as well which someone already caught)"
6/15/2010,"some literacy could help in putting your idea forward. nonetheless, i think this is a bad idea. you heard the man, high sec was never intended to harbor lvl5s. if you want to do them, occupy a lowsec pocket, militarize it and reap the fruits of your labor. no risk, no reward."
6/15/2010,"so your theory is that it is less risky to mission in low sec than in high sec. well by that logic low sec is less risk and more reward so i guess you are living in low sec space along with the majority of mission runners, right? no, your logic is wrong, your math is wrong, your theory is wrong and you are wrong.ccp wants level 5 missions in low security space. ccp created the game and that is what they want. if you do not like it then you can gtfo. the end."
6/15/2010,"all though your logic is slightly off, you are absolutely right about one thing: more ships will be lost to pve in highsec if lvl5's are allowed there. not because the risk of loosing a ship to pve is higher in highsec, but because more people do pve in highsec compared to lowsec.this is the only reason why more people loose ships to pve more often in highsec. safety means you lower your guard and stop paying attention. lvl5's are more dangerous in nature, so more ship should get lost, logically speaking.either way, i don't see why they shouldn't be allowed in highsec."
6/15/2010,"level 5 and high quality 4 missions were never supposed to be in highsec.so it is good they finally removed them.it will certainly draw more players to lowsec, maybe not much, but so be it.and even if it does not attract more people to lowsec, at least the lowsec mission runners will have more reward for being in lowsec.now we need to remove the level 4 quality 15 and higher agents from highsec and fixed !oh and not supported"
6/15/2010,"uhm, you are the one crying about your lost toy, we ( lowsec mission runners ) are happy with the status quo : level 4 quality 15 - 20 agents can stay in highsec while level 5 agents stay in lowsec ..."
6/15/2010,"erm, level 5 missions are not something that people can simply jump into unlike a level 1, therefore just moving the level 5 will not make more people mission run in empire, and if simply moving the missions is enough well they have been moved back to lowsec, therefore more pve will happen in lowsec and more people will move to lowsec by your logiclastly it dosnt actually matter if level 5's in high sec mean more ships are lost to pve, thats no the reason ccp moved them, loosing ships to pve shouldnt happen, as the rats dont do massive damage and you should know what your up against and prepare, its like saying better minerals in belts will mean more miners exploding in high sec, they shouldnt be exploding in the first place,the risk v reward isnt the only argument and even if it is, players are the biggest risk in lowsec, you have to get past gatecamps, get to the site, go in, finish before being scanned down and ganked then get back to base, thats the challenge to mission run while under a crossfire,"
6/15/2010,"not supported, lvl v's were supposed to be in lowsec, and should stay in lowsec.feel free to pay us protection money, that will be a great boost to local economy"
6/15/2010,ya right you just pointing out why low sec is just fail on ccp's part anyone will to pay for protection will pay for null sec space. and anyone with the manpower to lock down a low sec system for any kind of activity will rapidly fig out that they can make more doing it in 0.0/null or wh.just becouse low sec is fail do's not mean they have to turn around and make high sec fail too.
6/15/2010,"i think you're totally missing the point here. people don't do missions in lowsec because the primary point of doing missions for most people is making isk. players shooting each other tends to get in the way of that.as people are already doing lvl4's in highsec without any trouble, they might want to try a lvl5. all though trying a new and more challanging set of missions and have people shoot at you might be a bit much, so most people decide it's not worth the risk.and yes, i know most people don't loose ships to pve unless thtey're not paying attention, but that does not mean you're not supposed to loose them. it just means that most of the time it can be avoided one way or another. if ships weren't meant to be lost, then npc's wouldn't do any damage, and they most certainly wouldn't use scramblers and webs."
6/15/2010,ccp knows low sec missions are broken they learn that lesson thats why they changed sleeper ai to what it is.they need to pull 100% of missions out of low sec put them in high sec and set up a hole new better paying mission system in low sec based off wh's.edit: and the low sec lp stores should be differnt with better and differnt iteams then the high sec stores. so that us high sec mission runners dont delud low secs profits with are massive amount of mission runing and lp's.
6/15/2010,"i know many of you have accidentally passed waypoints without noticing, and then ended up 10 jumps past where you needed to pick stuff up...well...how about a circle around each waypoint system dot on the top left for that?maybe even have the ui voice say ""waypoint reached"" just like while on autopilot?(have the voice optional so it doesn't annoy people.)"
6/15/2010,"i ran into this same issue recently when i had to collect all my items of certain type across the universe. luckily i could use the assets window to keep track of things, but there really isn't a reason not to have this integrated to the normal navigation system. it is just a simple usability tweak with no negatives."
6/15/2010,"if you can add waypoints and it says destination reached,it cant be a massive leap to add waypoint reached"
6/15/2010,"proposal - make the distribution of generated anomalies by the pirate detection array a bell curve ie mostly the average value anom for your current upgrade level with some higher and lower rather than the current low end bias also the range is currently including anomalies not normally encountered in nullcurrently the infrastructure upgrade pirate detection array comes in 5 levelseach level adds a number of auto respawn on completion anomalies to the system it is installed inthese are something around 4 anomalies per levl of upgrade with a small quantity of the higher end anomalies based on the upgradeat level 4, this is a haven and 2 hubs approx, at 5 2 sanctums and 2 havens, more hubs and more of the lower ends, the idea is to improve the ability of a nullsec alliance to live solely in 0.0 making money from its own systems rather than clogging mission hubs running lvl4/5'sthe problem is the weighting on anomaly generation is a decay curve that peaks at the weakest anomalies and generates some mid level ones and a few highsexample a quick scan in two systems with a pirate 5 array got thisyard 2den 3 rally point 5 port 2hub 5 haven 2sanctum 2yard 2den 2 rally point 4 port 2hub 5 haven 2sanctum 2now the guide to anomalies says null sec typically has the top third of the anom table which yards and den's are not in, teing in the low end of the mid range,also there are a large number of rally points in both those systems, again a lower end plex,im not asking for pure haven/sanctum but if the maths generated a spike round hub tailing off to rallypoint and sanctum in a bell curve fashion it would bring the generated anomalies in line with 'wild' ones and make it more viable"
6/15/2010,"they do need a total rework and the problem is that frigates and destroyers are made useless by drones.look how they nerfed hybrid guns because gallente ships were putting out too much dps. but they havent ever touched drones, with their ******ed high tracking rate, ridiculous damage, and so on and so on.the hit ratios need to be reworked because anything smaller than a cruiser is cruiser lunch, with or without drones. that goes doubly for destroyers with twice the sig radius as frigates.destroyers also need +10% ab speed @ +2% cap use per level to be able to go fast like a destoyer should, but for a limited time. the sig radius is their achilles heel, but frigs and destroyers all got a 15% boost to shield, armor, and hull, then we'd see a rapid increase in viability of frigates, and consequently higher usage and viability of destroyers. people used to fly frigates for pirating back in '08. now that the majority of players can run bc/hac/bs, the frigates mysteriously disappear from usage in lowsec? could it be that drones are bull****? could it be that hp is too low? could it be that hit ratio is too high because of the way sig radius and so on are calculated?the coercer would be a much better ship than it currently is, but it only has 1 mid slot. do you put on a speed mod to speed tank large guns? or do you put on a scram to prevent escape and get ****d by large guns? hmm, choices (no not really any choice at all).as another suggestion, destroyers need more mid and lot slots, because they'll still be limited by their upper end fitting ceiling, so they can focus on using a few slots for one task, or using more slots for more generalized tasks."
6/15/2010,"oh you're an empire carebear. it all makes sense now, no wonder you have zero grasp of carrier mechanics. here i thought you were trolling but you were in fact just a really really ignorant poster"
6/15/2010,you seriously believe this crap?
6/15/2010,"- double-clicking on an extractor, auto-starts the survey.- pressing ctrl and clicking on a pin enables the ""create link""."
6/15/2010,supported.also could you add this:when importing/exporting goods display volume (m3) of materials in transit (middle panel) and total volume in target (custom office for export or launchpad for import). something similar like when you're building new pins/links. which displays old + new requirements.
6/15/2010,"this might sound stupid or seem like a troll to some, but for those of you who enjoyed playing starcraft, and played as the protoss, and enjoyed using a swarm of fighters to destroy your enemies through the use of carriers....imo i think it would be a great addition to eve to introduce a light carrier class ship.from what i have noticed there a 3 tiers of ships in each ship class, for example, the armageddon, apoc, and abaddon.so in this case introduce a light carrier to be a t1 light carrier, the carrier would be t2 and supercarrier being t3.*the light carrier would be able to be flown in high sec, meaning it would not be so large as to require a cyno to jump systems, allowing it to travel into .5+ systems.*like the other 2 carriers it would not have any turret or launcher hard points. its dps would rely solely on the drones it could field.* it would not be able to field fighter, or fighter bombers, just drones.* have the ability to field 1 additional drone per (race?)light carrier skill level, up to a maximum of 10 drones, making its dps compairable to the dps of other high sec class ships at their lvl 5 skill level.*its special abilities would be partially based off its t2/t3 counterparts, ie, drone dmg increase, armor resist increase, shield resist increase, armor/shield transfer ammount increase.these are just some ideas, i know that ccp will probably never implement it, however, i am just posting it to see what others would think of it.i know at one time ccp had a few ships that were able to field more than 5 drones, but took them out due to lag issues. but i do not think that would be the case with this ship.anyway, you opinions?"
6/15/2010,"meh, just fly a domi, it pretty much does all of that."
6/15/2010,"dps wise ... you would end up with the same dps as a domi, that said ... why invent a new ship when an existing ship can already do the same?!"
6/15/2010,buy a domi.
6/15/2010,"well i like the idea but it would need other advantages over the already mentioned domi... perhaps a clone vat bay? actually, scratch that, it should have a special kind of drone (speed of minnie drones combined with gallente drone damage?) - interceptor/assault drones, speed of for example a warrior with the dmg output of a hammerhead (edit: or valkyrie, so that race bonuses could be applied)?"
6/15/2010,the concept of a light carrier in itself has merit though id say perhaps a jf analog in that it could both cynojump or use gates (but have say a jump range half that of a conventional carrier)and maybe able to field a maximum of 5 fighters with a few other mods to make it a useful ship would still be hellaciously expensive though
6/15/2010,5 fighters do as much dps as a domi with 5 ogre ii. why would you need a new ship for that?
6/15/2010,"light carrier that can do the drone thing but with half the bay and no or not as good rr and no triage then, seriously people if someone puts down a vague base point thats approx domi you just go use a domi rather than go hmm but maybe with this,."
6/15/2010,"no, the point is, what you're asking for doesn't require a new ship. you see, (most) eve ships (except the legion) have a role that they fill. your light carrier would have no role, since the dominix can already do everything you're asking it to do (including rr, btw) and would probably do it better, and cost less. for that matter, you could pull off the same thing with a typhoon, just with less reserves (in terms of drones).not supported."
6/15/2010,"pshh carrier like i give a rats. (i don't heck i barely leave jita) im just working on constructive criticism now you have been sir, i salute you, you pointed out that there needs to be a role for the light carrier and there isnt really one,the people who said buy a domi could have ended this so much earlier by just adding that issue about no role,and now i shall cease the devils advocate role, on this at least.exit stage left with ominous laughter"
6/15/2010,"a subcap carrier would be a nice idea (similar to the subcap orca), to give fighter & rr support. i would buy one.supported."
6/15/2010,"the idea may have merit, but it needs some way of being differentiated from the domi without being overpowered, and it needs a specific role to fill. i'll see about hashing out some ideas for it later."
6/15/2010,i would let it keep fighter drones but it gets no more then 5 out at a time. no +1 a skill level or the ablity to fit the high slot mod that also +1's them.5 fighter drones would be hot to play with in high sec missions. and ya i would stick with the other bounses as the biger brothers.. i.e. no weapons in high slots that kind of thing but less tank and all that too.

6/15/2010,"you'd have to change missile mechanics regardless. currently, missiles aren't just graphics like turrets are. they're actual objects that fly through space, change course, can be shot down by defenders (speaking of mechanics that need to be changed), and all this other jazz that people seem to take for granted. if you want to ""demote"" them, so to speak, to being just graphics, it would require a rework of the missile code.the point here is that this proposal brings with it a significant amount of work that a lot of people don't seem to realize. it's not just having some modeler slapping launchers onto each ship. there's a great deal of programming involved here as well."
6/15/2010,"when mining in general, the ore is added to your cargo once the cycle has finished (in terms of strip miners) my proposal is that, i would very much like to see the ore being placed into my cargo as it is being mined, and not all at once at the end of the cycle. i have no doubt that the mechanics of the game could easily allow for this sort of calculation to be made, and done.apologies if this has already been raised.thank you for reading my proosal, and welcome any criticisms regards, c linski"
6/15/2010,to what end? why?it changes nothing... and honestly it already does that... just shut off the strip miners sooner rather then letting them finish the cycle.sorry but i don't see anything constructive about this. other than adding more work for ccp that needs to be spent somewhere else.
6/15/2010,"i am in agreement with you that it does not change the outcome.however i feel that it adds a more 'realtime' aspect to miner's, it makes it more enjoyable seeing the consistant build up of ore going in than the bulk drop at the end. for the small amount of work for ccp it would take to impliment this idea, i feel that it would make mining that little bit more enjoyable thanks for the feedback all the same though"
6/15/2010,i wonder howmuch the servers would enjoy this real time process
6/15/2010,"it's a good idea, but would completely destroy the pvp aspect of mining! i'm referring to situations where the bloke next to you starts mining your targetted asteroid, and it's close to popping, and you cut your lasers off before his cycle ends so that you get the last of the asteroid and he gets nothing. or is it just me that does that?"
6/15/2010,"i don't know if it is just you that does that, but you make me want to give mining a second chance just to try it and see what happens."
6/15/2010,confirming that this ^^ and arkonor are the only reasons to mine.

6/16/2010,thanks for the heads up.updated to reflect changes.
6/16/2010,i dont care and probly most dont care about the if they add stats to all or boost training times. what realy maters for us older players the trained them up is geting to spend thoughs sp's right now on the skills we want them in.becouse we already spent that time training. not only that we have +5mil sp's in max training skills but when we trained them it was a much longer training time to get up to them.so the real deal here is do we just give them the +5mil sp's they have in there training skills are do we also rembust them and addital amout of sp's for all the time they spent training learning skills with out max learning skills to help them train them?i say remburs all learning skills sp + 10% sp as compistion. and let that pilot pick were he wants to place the sp right at that moment he logs in to his toon.
6/16/2010,"if learning skills had never been in the game it would have taken all us vets another year or more to get to where we currently are, im sure my learning skills havesaved me months, thats the whole reason why we all trained learning skills early, they paid themselves back in spending a month training them by saving us months in the long run, we have had the benefit, lots of it, and by getting +10 to all stats we dont loose anything,as an example this is like someone investing money in a companyyears later share dividends have paid back that investment many times over and the company is about to go under and you complain that just getting your money back isnt fair you want a proift,you already had the profit it just didnt announce itselfstart a new toon on your main (only temporary) load him into eve mon, set up a network of skill plans to train up to all the skills you have right now but without touching learning skills, see how many years that would take, now look at your main characters age,you got your profit right there, youve saved time, the one resource thats near priceless"
6/16/2010,not supported.this game is about making others cry and learning skills do that.ideally add a third tier of them to filter out those players with weak spines before they ruin the game further.
6/16/2010,"i have to agree with tak here. i am roughly the same age as most of my corp mates and i have all but the two charisma skills to lvl 5. which took me ages. all my corp mates in the beginning said that i was a bit stupid to take them all that far. however i have now surpassed most of my corp mates simply because i took the time. this solution that has been presented is almost fair however, it does not account for the accelerated training time i have benefited from in the mean time. how would we calculate that or is it simply stfuagowt?this game is all about investing time. that's what makes it so special. when you lose a ship or a clone its not the isk you're bothered about. its how long it took you to accumulate that isk and then, build your ship, get all your implants in etc etc.losing learning skills (all together) is imo a bad idea. perhaps (new) people could get an option in character creation to apply some sp in the basic learning skills area. i have no problem with giving new players more sp on character creation."
6/16/2010,maybe give all new chars basic learning skills to l4 and advanced 3 in addition to what they currently get?
6/16/2010,"not supported. however i do agree that learning skills can be tedius yes, but you aren't forced to train them in the first place. true however is that most people including me will advise one to do that, i did it myself and i've only played for a few months myself. but i also have a solution for new people, many complain that new people spend their first weeks just sitting around being bored etc, which can be true if you take on learning skills asap.my solution is that you spend the first 2-3 weeks either training for a mining or combat ship. say getting racial frigate 5, weapon skill to 5 so that you can use whatever t2 weapons system and tanking skills to reasonable level, this could also go for a miner aswell getting into a retiever and start making some money.playing around some in evemon gives me that, for the non missile using races it would take about 1 month to get into a fully useable combat frigate with t2 weapons.skills weapon system of your choicespecalisations to 4racial frigate to 5estimated sp1.12 million sp. as far as caldari and basic skills go for combat(i don't fly caldari so i could be wrong here) it is about the same time.skills rocket specalisation 4missile launcher operations 5rockets 5caldari frigate 5estiamted sp 1.2 millionnow for a miner, basic choice here would be the retriever. theese are only the basic skills needed.but for a completely fresh toon to get into a retriever it would only be about 2 weeks. netting you a sp amount of aproximately 561k.true going for combat is abit more skill intensive and puts you at a higher estimated sp. but it would also nullify the argument that you can't do anything because of learning skills.i chose only to pick up the most common proffesions. the advantage here aswell is that once you complete your learning skills you will be able to get into any t2 frigate of your choice once you train the skills needed for it. but you will also be able to so something while you train the learning skills, granted level 1's aren't that much fun, but you will be able to do them somewhat efficently. the skillplan lacks other needed skills which is true, but those do not really have a huge impact on level 1's in my exerpience. anyway theese are just my two cents."
6/16/2010,"low-sec needs this attention, an improvement to low-sec would increase the enjoyment of the game for a large portion of players and may entice others into more interesting better developed areas of the game (like pvp for instance).so.... bump."
6/16/2010,"agree with most of the points mentioned.however, if you want all of the empires to be bordered by lowsec, you have to make sure there are no easy chokepoints. do not want rancer mk ii"

6/16/2010,"2 years ago i would have said faction ships were forgotten relics of a time long past in eve. with their recent buff and new ships added frequently it is clear ccp wants faction ships in eve and is going to be adding even more in the future. why not faction capitals and supercapitals? obviously the cost of both the bpc and producing the actual item would need to be much higher than anything any lp store or industrialist has ever seen, especially in the case of a faction supercapital. faction capitals would be the toys of the rich who do not wish to be trapped in the tombs that are supercapitals but find faction bs far too common. cost would be entirely up to ccp.faction supercapitals would be prohibitively expensive for all but the absolute richest in eve. again cost would be entirely up to ccp but hopefully it would remain high enough that 40b for a non faction titan would seem cheap in comparison. it would also give people who have a titan and get bored because there is nothing left to achieve in eve in their eyes from quitting. how cool would a true sansha mothership or titan be? something that large and spikey would just be impressive to see cyno in(once the cyno effect stops sucking)we have faction pos guns, webs, points, and even ecm, why not give us faction pos hardeners, labs, factories, miners, cyno jammers, cyno generators, and cyno arrays. these things wouldn't always have more hp but would instead benefit from higher productivity, less waste, and lower ozone usage. on top of all this why not allow these items not to be farmable by the random high sec macro, only through missions for corporations exclusively located in lowsec or npc 0.0 would allow you to gain the lp for these items. this would give lowsec it's own niche value that 0.0 and empire already have. ccp has struggled with why people don't go into lowsec much beyond fw and pirating because quite simply they lack any real reason beyond level 5s(and that is very recent). just as every ship in eve fills a specific niche, low sec needs a niche. yes i know they are super carriers and not motherships but jesus **** is that an awful name and i am writing this while pretty intoxicated so sentence and paragraph structure be damned. faction supercaps wont ever be about cost effectiveness or even having the biggest ship, they will be the shiniest and largest of all e-***** in eve. sought after by many.edit: i would like to emphasize the faction caps/supercaps would only be the peak of the lp store. not the entirety of it. you would be getting other toys such as destroyers, battlecruisers, tier 2 faction bs for pirate factions, tier 3 faction bs for navy factions, implants, pos mods, and the usual assortment of ammo/ships/implants found in all equivalent lp stores"
6/16/2010,faction capitals.... fapitals?
6/16/2010,fapitals indeed
6/16/2010,thumb up for fapfapfapfapitaledit: up not ip
6/16/2010,i endorse this product!
6/16/2010,"not sure if want.that would require the creation of a separate lp counter. and then 5 years of lowsec/0.0 mission running for a fapital?this also raises the question about t2 capitals, tho admittedly fapitals are much easier to introduce because you don't have to find a role for them."
6/16/2010,"it would only require a new lp store for the new corps as i already said since the corps selling these items are only found in lowsec and 0.0. these lp stores would also share many of the items for their racial empire counterparts. ammo, cruisers, frigates, bs, implants, etc.no seperate lp store for a corp based off where you are, just a completely different corporation you are working for.edit: and yes a very long time farming lp's would be ideal to keep these as rare as possible. rare items are expensive items, expensive items are prestige in many people's eyes."
6/16/2010,"well alright, why not. tho i still don't see a good reason to introduce them other than give the super rich something to sink isk into.500+ bil faction titan km anyone?"
6/16/2010,"the caps and supercaps are primarily toys for the rich, the other faction items such as pos mods would be more for your everyday eve group. obviously you would need other faction items that simply aren't in the game yet, possibly things like faction outposts(ya i went there) and sov structures. hopefully more things usable outside 0.0 would also be available. end goal is to give low sec it's own special thing you *cannot* get in empire and making it valuable enough that people actually want what lowsec has to offer enough to venture from high sec in search of greater riches.oh hey i forgot, faction battlecruisers and destroyers would be pretty amazing toys as well. lower end of the isk totem pole."
6/16/2010,"i like the idea, altho faction bcs would reduce the command ship niche even more, which is a shame."
6/16/2010,unless you took away their ability to run gang links in favor of damage or mobility bonuses.
6/16/2010,i want a blood raider dreadnought.
6/16/2010,yarr i want a republic ragnarok with a top-wingy-bit for more speed
6/16/2010,"you don't think it would be a better idea to move away from ""capitals online"" by means of looking for ways to promote and reward small to medium level pvp prowesse?right now the supercapital card is the ace that trumps everything, for all intents and practical purposes, up to and including killing nodes as a means of campaign doctrine. it's one of those points of presence in eve where volume impedes dynamics.pushing to encourage this trend, under the marketing of ""let's make low sec interesting for faction bpc's"" seems to be a continuation of a school of thought which is counterproductive to pvp. i admit, it would be very nice to see low sec being useful and interesting, but this format is just following the path that builds upon and promotes trench warfare on an increasingly higher scale.i can see why many people want that, but that is a political instrument, not something that ties to game design. look at the state of eve in china, where political polarisation and arms proliferation has resulted in an environment of several great virtual walls in space, behind which people do as they please for the sake of the grind, while the subscriber and concurrent user counts continue to decline.i'm sorry, but you need to do better marketing this is just politics, understandable, but not attractive.honestly low sec would be much better served by mechanisms that enable players to influence it directly and dynamically through their actions. this is a principle that has always pushed eve ahead."
6/16/2010,"you know i was taking your post seriously until you described faction warfare as the feature to ""save lowsec"". i especially like the bit where you said essentially ""lowsec could be useful and interesting or we could give them faction warfare"". it's like you're ****ing on everyone who reads your posts without the courtesy of even trying to call it rain.try harder next time, this was such an obvious troll it hurts me you thought it would work :(edit: added in a quote of your post so you can't change it ^_^"
6/16/2010,"don't twist words, or try to put words in someone's mouth you're better then that. i never mentioned faction warfare, far from it.i agree low sec needs viable elements that make it worth people's while to dabble in it, to live in it, to work in it and kill in it. and yes, that is very limited right now. however, throwing one structural challenge of eve in as a means of reward of the negative spiral, is not a solution. i'd love to turn my titans into faction versions, i can just picture a true sansha mushroom with globular extensions underneath - but that is a topic entirely on its own.if you truly want to make low sec a viable niche within eve, i wouldn't put it to the use of other niches, but try and think of ways where low sec as a niche is able to function as a niche first, and interact with other niches second."
6/16/2010,so you agree lowsec needs to be viable but you don't want to see a pile of new faction things because you disagree with the idea of faction capitals because somehow it encourages trench warfare(that will be there anyways) you think lowsec needs a draw that isn't this but it's a vague feature that allows players to influence the game directly with their actions(faction warfare) but it most definitely is not faction warfare. you're either trolling or ****ing ******ed.
6/16/2010,"i agree, even if the faction capitals were functionally equivalent to the current capitals but with different models. true sansha supercarrier.... yes please!"
6/16/2010,"faction capitals would make this game even more insane then it is, it is simply content that has no relevant purpose right now in eve.sadly more and more content required to hold subscriber retention shows us quite clearly that eve is slowly becoming more like the game of 'wow'.the trend that new expansions are released and there is a massive boom of online players then slowly over time that player base fades away, eve's content has (imo) been flawed massively over the years that has dragged us into this wow like state to keep players interested in the game and keep players dumb that isk is the ultimate thing that will keep you alive in eve.*insert troll* the north are blue for the whole reason of prosperity and enrichment of eve, the mass scale production of 'things' that is on a huge level slowly breaking the game, we all ready have 400 titans in game or something now, and the north in the h-w scenario brought a massive 17 tot he field and won the fight because they can click the 'i win' button 17 times.now imagine faction titans with some silly ship upgrades to the doomsday weapon or even improved dps power, the ""i win"" button turns into ""i defiantly win"".releasing faction caps will within a year or so, show that money makers who have no real clue how to fight (except for en'mass to hide skill) will have another win card over those that dedicate there game to fighting right now stupid overall game mechanics as it is.this idea would (imo) break eve even further and only a dedicated money maker would care about such stupid content.*ps. nerf drakes!*"
6/16/2010,"i'd love to see low sec have commercially interesting elements, stuff that makes it worth people's while to venture there. you and i both know this is one of the reasons why 0.0 attracts people, it's the concept of ""if it doesn't pay, it ain't gonna go your way"". ccp will, among other things, have to think of ways to address this.that being said, i do think that taking the angle of (super)capitals as a point of interest here is the wrong angle to take. i think it is fair to say that there are differences in how people approach 0.0 and the empires players build, but i think it is also fair to say that there is something of a law of diminishing returns that already applies to 0.0 for reasons directly tied to the topic of (super)capitals. several parts of that challenge have already been addressed, but as we all know 0.0 is where it is the most clear of all places that there are limits to this race between the mythical bullet and the armour, not the least in terms of performance but on a more fundamental level in terms of human behaviour. we're human beings, we always seek shelter and dominance alike in numbers.but that is a topic on its own. which is one of the reasons why i think it is not a great idea to use this as an instrument of pushing another niche of the game.also, repeating something which is your conclusion, and not mine, does not make the insinuation that i am advertising faction warfare any more true truthfully, on the contrary. i see faction warfare as its own niche within the game, and an admittedly failed annex flawed niche, but that too is a topic on its own.i think that the commercial value is only one piece of the puzzle for low sec, it reminds me of something we have in 0.0: the ability to influence the territory, to build a dominion within it, to leave a mark on it. to have an impact on the elements and people within the niche. these are things which low sec simply does not have.that being said, ccp always establishes niches in such a way that they are interconnected, but always with tangible merit from the niche to the niche. this is what makes people live, build, work and kill in those niches.btw, vuk just said he is buying us a suite in the m-o hotel, so we can get a room there. we're getting tj and chee as personal assistants, sweet deal no?"
6/16/2010,"faction ships have 50% more ehp (hull/armour/shields) and either more weapon mounts or two extra slots.do you really want dreadnaughts that do 33% more damage or carriers that tank harder than anything in game as tools solely for the stupidly wealthy?reason why frigs through bs work in faction flavours is because they are within reach of pretty much everyone skill and isk wise - capitals not so much.ps: pirate factions should never, ever have anything resembling agents in empire. would make farming faction gear a trifle and break what is left of rp/pf in eve .."
6/16/2010,"i agree ccp has a lot to do with already existing features to make the game more attractive to the players currently here. but in this thread that is neither here nor there because in the end ccp decides which they do and to a very minor extent you do with your credit card. this is an idea that would likely be more of a long term goal.you even admit this is a troll. titan is definitely not an i win button and we both know thisi do not think this would be released within a year. ccp stated in a dev blog in the last year that making a ship model takes six months, we are talking about several dozen ship models. this is obviously a long term project. only a dedicated money maker would care about breaking into a completely new market where demand was high and supply was(initially) incredibly low? i think one would say anyone that can do basic math would rush to at least try this, just like wormholes, exploration, invention, moon mining and other features ccp has introduced. but i guess that view is why i am space rich and you are probably not. i routinely pursue chances i see to make money in new niches in eve. those who are content to do nothing but run level 4's in motsu are free to continue doing so, this would simply offer another path when the rest of the population tire of that.other post is under this linea dread is pretty easy to kill and there is no carved in stone rule saying these ships needed such a massive boost in ehp. i personally would be against 50% more ehp. 10-20% at absolute most if they needed some sort of ehp bonus. the turret bonuses are also not set in stone, simply giving them another bonus would likely be enough and possibly 1 more turret slot or increased tracking while sieged. think outside the boxmany faction items and ships are outside the buying power of most of eve without a very long time of planning. i could buy a dozen of every non special event faction ship in the game and still have enough to buy several titans. i am not the only person in eve that has amassed a wealth. why should we be excluded just because you cant afford it? the pirate factions would be in npc 0.0 as stated above. also pirate factions are allowed to hold sov by concord so they could have lowsec where they hold sov or simply have a station under another empire that shares their interests. :)"
6/16/2010,"i will have to respond to this fully later, a group of fifteen people are throwing out paragraphs of stuff concerning this post where you are either blowing smoke or ******ed. i don't have time to condense it all now."
6/16/2010,what i am saying is:fc: pirate erebus with some awesome armour buff per level 35% on top of 7.5% per level is? i don't do maths =d.wc: some normal erebus at 7.5% per levelsc: i don't know a damnation with armour buffs (insert: omg i win and will never die god mode!).the reason the buffs would work is because these are 2 unique ships.this is what i mean by game breaking.
6/16/2010,or as stated above for faction battlecruisers you can remove those sorts of bonuses in favor of more aggressive bonuses. game breaking problem solved.
6/16/2010,"erm a move aggressive titan would be... scary stuff to quote nuker payback ""properly fit titans can insta-pop battleships""... a more aggressive titan would be something along the lines of... titan warps in locks 6 or something battleships and puts 1 laser on each bs.something which i haven't seen done since flying with someone called zeal dragon in curse whom at one point put 1 laser on multiple battleship targets to destroy them! back when gank geddons off course existed.scary proposition mr ed :)"
6/16/2010,"i can assure you i don't treat the assembly hall from any angle of politics, blowing smoke or limitations on intellectual capacity, considering the new status of csm and its processes as a stakeholder to ccp such approaches seem counterproductive to the principles. this obviously aside of being counterproductive to the fundamental requirements for such processes to function.beside that, i don't do blowing smoke, a little asking around internally can easily attest to that, relax.i am intruiged btw, by the angle of approach. putting commercial interests in low sec can be one part of the solution (with the part of staying away from putting it to use for marketing or mixing it up with structural challenges in other game niches). i do think that low sec can be a viable environment for faction elements. i like the faction bpc angle, within limitations, but i wonder how it would play out if pos gear and/or ship bpc drops were to be moved to low sec, or do you see that as something which would be available both from 0.0 and lowsec. the pos focus i can see, since with the pi drama there is much more viability for the milking of planets in low sec then in high sec."
6/16/2010,"no, nothing like that. the things most these races already get in their faction ships, for the navies its usually an extra faction and tank slot, for pirates its everything from improved drone useage to nuet/web range bonuses. these things wouldn't be game breaking or ""i win"" buttons. you wouldn't be getting 8x the power you currently have, just an extra feature or gimmick."
6/16/2010,"create a new low slot module that gives 20% chance to prevent cargo scanning, with a stacking penalty. this would prevent freighters from using it, but would allow industrials a chance to prevent cargo scanning. since it's a low slot module, those same industrials would need to give up cargo capacity to equip one. and since there is a stacking penality it would still allow a chance for cargo scanners to work. i think it works well as it doesn't remove the risk but creates a trade-off like so many things in eve."
6/16/2010,"alternatively, dont afk auto pilot."
6/16/2010,negative.... this is irrelevant.this is something else entirely.however the idea has merit in one major area.smuggling.a module that jams or prevents scanning of cargo can's would be great.that or a new can that prevents scans based on chance... where you have to re-roll.use the survey scan to make the odds go up or something.this should be broken off in a different thread.suicide ganking happens for any number of reasons. and while i don't approve of it... i can't justifiably deny it either.
6/16/2010,"actually smuggling would go quite well with my earlier suggestion of bribing concord to look the other way based on security of the systems you're in. the amount would be based on the criminal act you wanted to do and how much you wanted them looking the other way. jihading someone would be pretty expensive and would only slow concords response less than a minute at maximum bribe, smuggling could possibly completely pay out concord to leave them alone. even though i think it's faction police that scan you."
6/16/2010,*bump*stop the invisible aggression timer madness...
6/16/2010,"one could argue that h i t l e r (why is it censored please??) was right, does not mean that is the case.if someone shoots my property (i assume you want to count the wrecks as my property) i should get the right to kill him for longer, not another way round. you don't get a right to kill someone by shooting his garbage, that just doesn't make any sense. i see no reason why eve shoudn't make sense. i, however, support this motion regardless of how it is fixed. no matter how small a mistake in ui is, it shall be fixed."
6/16/2010,the aggression timer is used for more than determining who has rights to shoot someone without concord intervention or sec hits its also used to determine who has been involved with pvp recently
6/16/2010,"that doesn't change the fact that extending it without any sign of it is idiotic. that's even if there was a non-ridicules way of ""extending"" it, other than the one described in the first few posts. supported."
6/16/2010,god yes. most annoying thing ever.
6/16/2010,wat?
6/16/2010,supporting my own poast
6/16/2010,"yes please. and since you mentioned it, extend the bonus on the sacrilege to hmls."
6/16/2010,"supporting the original idea, but not this - whole point of the khanid ships is that they only buff the short-range missiles. also, lach needs +2 launcher hardpoints."
6/16/2010,"i am not a missile user, but this makes no sence."
6/16/2010,"as this thread goes on you start to make less and less sense. which really is quite an accomplishment given the original post. level 5s are in low sec for a reason. this post i quoted sounds like a conspiracy theory with no proof. though you know they are watching you right now!also ""4"" is not a proper substitute for the word ""for,"" just for future reference."
6/16/2010,its a better ideal then low sec and ccp's learn to pvp and blob or htfu ideals. as in the end ccp is the only one's that will hftu when one of the other mmo makers gets it righ and do's not copy some cheazie tv or movie show but reather builds a new freash sci-fi world of there own with good pve in it.the fact that the other mmo compys are trying is prof they know the market is there they just have not fig out that some already made tv or movie back groud story is whats killing them. but with the kind of mony there spending on it someone will take the time to get that part fig out.so if ccp do's not want its pve players cash some one elsa do's.
6/16/2010,"....wow....eve is not wow...most people play for the sandbox feel (mainly pvp), combat, mining, industry, and market manipulation is all eveidence of this. pve content is there for people who enjoy it, and as an isk faucet so there is always a source for more money to come into the game.drop the whine and the anger and accept that most of the wya things are happens after hours of debate. i'm not saying ccp is perfect, but there has been not major change to the basic concept of the missions for a long time, it's all small manipulation from here. they like it the way it is, and no amount of forum rage will change ther mind. come up with a solid plan, privide proof and a positive action plan, and then you might get a better response from the community.acps not supported, again"
6/16/2010,"explain two things:1) why missions that were implicitly designed to only occur in lowsec should be allowed in highsec.and2) how, considering the mechanics seperating highsec and lowsec (concord/faction), that ships and items that are unable to travel to highsec would suddenly be allowed in highsec?ps: stfu and stop complaining about l5's, they're staying in lowsec where they bloody ****ing belong [/mad]"
6/16/2010,i stoped at wow. i am a sci-fi guy not a fantasy guy.
6/16/2010,1. becouse they have already been in high sec for the last 3 years. no reason to move them now.2. i dont understand this ? any body using a carry to do level 5's were already doing low sec level 5'sbut 2 do's give a cool ideal that low sec fraction stores could have fraction capitals for low sec mission runners. and that low sec missions could be more in line with sleepers or fw missions. more inline with pvp ships.that i belive would be a much stronger boost to low sec then puting this level 5's in there only after 3 years with nothing in the lp stores that you cant get in high sec.edit: see this is what i dont get man why do's low sec cry nerf high sec instead of demanding buffs to low sec?
6/16/2010,"because until high sec is not as profitable as it is a lot of the little care bears like yourself won't leave. i love the logic of this thread btw. ""people don't know how to fit their ships and lose them to missions so obviously level 5's should be in high sec"""
6/16/2010,"yeah it is bemusing to use one word i also love the argumentswell you were doing it wrong for 3 years so there is no reason to fix it and do it right, there are reasons to change it after 3 years, ccp stated them when they did it and the more you go wah wah wah we want our super isk faucet back wah wah wah the less likely you are to get any support from anyonei really am so glad i live in null and treat empire as the place where domination mods and skill books come from"
6/16/2010,the reason pve loss's are gretaer in high sec than low-sec is the simple reason that all mission runners live in high sec no missioner in there right mind goes to low-sec since lv5's are in high sec therefor they need to be moved to low-sec to give use more pve kills :d
6/16/2010,"tl/dr  add to sensor dampeners max # target lock reduction attribute. could not reduce available target locks below 1. lots of charts and math and explanations as to why this might be a good idea*****purpose: change to sensor dampening mechanic in order to bring it in line with other ew warfare modules while maintaining current themes and game balance while requiring the least amount of new coding needing to be implemented.proposal: add to the current existing sensor dampener modules the attribute target lock reduction that reduces the maximum number of target locks a particular ship may have active. the percentage should simply mirror already existing percentages on said modules. create a third loadable script for the sensor dampening module that will only affect the target lock reduction percentage at the expense of the other two attributes.the equation for the target lock reduction should be exactly how it sounds, if a ship is capable of 6 maximum target locks and receives a 50% reduction to maximum locked targets, it will now only be able to maintain 3 locked targets and will drop any target locks past the 3rd starting with the most recent locks being dropped first. in the event of a decimal remainder after the reduction equation takes place, the maximum number of locked targets should be rounded to the next highest number, so as to ensure that the ship is always capable of at least one target lock and helps give a buffer in favor of the victim ship to prevent mechanic from being overpowered. all stacking penalties for multiple ew modules on a single target or module modifiers (in this case rigs) should apply.impact on play: the proposed change would give viability for the implementation of sensor dampening in large scale fleet battles. a commander could order target dampening on say, a high lock count destroyer to reduce their ability to chew through swaths of drones, or to reduce the effectiveness of large scale spider tanking setups. those under the effects of max target reduction would have to pickand choose more carefully which ships they choose to lock onto, creating an even deeper level of play for logistics pilots and giving a viable counter outside of standard jamming.counter modules to this form of ew are allready in existance with the auto targeting module (high slot) that boosts the maximum number of possible targets. this would not be a game breaking mechanic. the pilot would still be capable of unlocking, switing targets, and resuming fire/logistics, it would simply make things more difficult and quite possibly synergize well with the sensor dampeners natural locking speed reduction, slowing down the pace of battle. testing would be necessary to see if implimentaion would cause any unforseen problems.in summary: this sort of change would increase the effectiveness of the sensor dampener while keeping it in line with the current themes of operations. sensor dampeners are not meant to completely shut down a ships targeting system and their overall aim is to help controll the pace of battle. by allowing them to reduce the number of targeted ships you would slow down large fleet scale engagements and give a ballanced tactical advantage to the user.i have included reference charts in order to ease the understanding in the level of effectiveness this sort change would make. all equations are basically existing rate - reduction % and accounted for stacking penalty utilized the simplified percentages found on the eve online wikipedia (100% 87% 57% 28% 10% 3%). final module percentages were created utilizing eft. all final numbers were rounded to the next highest number if there was any remainder.*see below*"

6/16/2010,"despite their claims that the pi development team will still be working on it... i really doubt any changes will come about for the better part of a year or more, if ever.they'll get pulled for yet more 'content development' and leave just one more broken feature in the game never to be looked at again.the list is stunningly long at this point."
6/16/2010,god yes. at least some of these suggestions should be done asap.
6/16/2010,"i'm wondering is there any interest in the community to have ccp look into ways to change the duration of session change timers. i'm well aware of the purpose they serve and that such a change would create new problems or exacerbate old existing ones, but i feel the timers are too long in some cases and the new problems created would be manageable or solvable.as i understand it ccp just uses a universal session change timer for all kinds of different activities. some seem more justified than other. for example i can accept the timer while jumping or having just undocked, but the 30 second wait in a station while changing ships is just annoying. would it cause an apocalypse, if it was much lower with the ship change in a station? if the issue is people docking and quickly changing ships and undocking, couldn't there be a separate timer that starts when you dock, that prevents players from ""exploiting"" this.i guess i just want ccp to have a goal where they look into reducing these timers to the minimum when and where ever it is possible. the bottom line is that they are annoying and at times disruptive to the pace of gameplay, so ccp should on principle reduce and replace them with alternative mechanics if and when such methods become available. do the timers bother others too or am i just the only one?"
6/16/2010,the ship change session timer is just horrible. i really see no justification for it.
6/16/2010,supported.it's also stupid that we can't see what's fitted to a ship without having to activate it first.
6/16/2010,"can't you implement a feature where you can change your name. just as you have with portraits.pay a sum to be able to change your name.i know there reasons why you shouldn't be able to but like employement history can't you just put a ""formerly known as: your previous name"""
6/16/2010,no. the name is your identity in the game.
6/16/2010,"not enthusiastic about such change. i wan't to be able to see your original and only name easily and not have to track it down from an info window with several other aliases. everything is tied to it in this game, so any ways to alter or mask it should not be allowed. most of the people who care so much about names already made a decent one at the start anyway."
6/16/2010,"in a game like eve changing identity should be a viable choice. you can already change your face. why shouldnt one be able to change the name.think about all those shady dealers going underground changing identities. sure you wouldnt recognise them first but just as you check employement history you can check former aliases. there are people here on the forums that love tracking down character trades, old posts etc etc. private investigators.it's not just a way to change a stupid name .in my case, i mean it was 6 years ago i made my character. my idea of ""funny"" isn't really funny anymore.and of course, like attribute remapping there could be a cooldown. and for example a 25$ pricetag on it so everyone doesn't go changing name."
6/16/2010,we need to fix low sec missions to be more in line with low sec. they should not have high sec missions and high sec lp stores forced on them in this blantent maner.1. low sec is hard and should get its own rewards to reflect that fact. all carebear level 1-5 missions in game right now should be shoved right back into high sec with there bloted worthless lp stores. 2. there should be two differnt lp tabs one for high sec lp's for high sec lp stores and one for low sec and low sec lp stores as we have to spilt low sec and high sec fraction lps up but still beable to work for the same fractions that are already in place.3. place new level 1-5 pvp based missions into low sec. something in line with the sleeper and fw were missions are made so that pvp fitted ships are needed to run the missions.4. new low sec lp shops to spend this hard won low sec lp's at. and this stuff has to be not just good but great. i belive that tier 3 fraction battle ships and fraction caps like carriers and dreadnoughts should fit in here with fraction mods to fit them up with even fraction ammos and fighter drones as well.then ccp should see that it is good and do the same in 0.0 .
6/16/2010,i actually like this. lowsec needs something that is completely undoable in highsec. not just doable at lower profit. as it is lowsec is a complete ****hole. until the masses start moving into lowsec we won't see masses moving to 0.0. they need to encounter pvp and see that it is not as scary as many view :)
6/16/2010,supporting my own ideal as it could get me and other carebears into low sec for this but for the level 5's and the low sec lp's right now not a snowballs % in hell.besides this is a much better fix to risk v rewards. you dont have to nerf high sec to the ground you can buff low sec instead.
6/16/2010,so more or less fw missions without the need to joying fw? it should be a bit worse than fw. supported as any things that can make mission better is welcome.
6/16/2010,"low sec missions already receive roughly double rewards. the trouble is it's tied to the agent's location rather than the mission. additionally it only applies to rewards, not loot/salvage/bounties which are the main source of income with the exception of lvl5's. if bounties are tied to system sec, the problem goes away mostly. i also think the rewards/bounties should have only three tiers: high sec, low sec, null sec. there is no difference in risk between 0.1 sec and 0.4 sec, the rewards should reflect that.in regards to special missions and lp stores, i'm not necessarily opposed but fw missions are not the thing to look at. fw missions were designed to generate pvp, as such they are typically 10-20 jumps from the agent in the opposing faction's low sec space. they also throw a beacon on the overview for all to see. to balance that out, most of them can be run solo or pairs in under 2 minutes as they require you to kill but a single bs or a handful of haulers. the result is nearly everyone runs them with a stealth bomber and a t1 throw away frigate. the frigate pulls aggro while the bomber kills the objective. if a hostile shows up, the bomber cloaks and the frigate is 100-200km off the warp in. it's a brain dead exercise that poses virtually no risk to anyone but the throw away frigate. and who cares about that thing? that's not the model to look to.i think the current setup is fine but the difference in payouts should be enhanced via bounties being tied to system sec. i would also support the actual mission rewards being increased from 2x to 3x that of mid high sec (0.8).in short, i don't support your proposal because it's poorly thought out and you know nothing of low sec pve or pvp. you also clearly know nothing about fw missions else you wouldn't have suggested them as a model."
6/16/2010,"actually doing something as simple as giving lowsec based corporations lp stores things like faction capitals. faction pos mods both offensive like we have now and defensive such as hardeners or even faction factories, labs, and extractors. incentives you can only get by running missions in low sec. these are simply examples, any sort of faction gear that is both useful and not to be found elsewhere in eve will do. or at least not in high sec. you would see the amounts of people daring lowsec skyrocket for the chance of these riches. i would also like to see missions somehow extend through wormholes but that is a completely different topic.edit: in fact im making a thread about it.buffing lowsec itself won't really do much beyond make the people already there more sustainable. the goal here is to attract new denizens from higher security space not to enhance the lifestyle of current lowsec dwellers"
6/16/2010,"buff low sec, not low-sec missions.edit: linkified for your greater viewing pleasure."
6/16/2010,"defensive for you, and for the other people shooting eac hother at the gate who are not involved with you in any way.offensive because it stops rring, energy xfer, remote sensor boosters, remote eccm, etc etc ad infinitum, all of which degrads combat perfomance for random people trying to fight each other and you interfering because u didnt want ur freighter popped.done.except that everyone has alts and power of two encourages faceless masses of ""consequence avoiding drones"" to do things in highsec.its not against the eula to use an alt to avoid your negative security status as a pirate to get your good shipped to your main from empire space.how can recycling alts be against the eula, if the above is true? in both instances, you're avoiding the consequences of actions. ccp cant make one against the eula and not the other without becoming hypocritical."
6/16/2010,well the alt problem can be avoided by simply having the pilot who initiates the ecm burst get an aggression flag to everyone he hits but no gcc. simple.but i do agree an ecm burst is a purely defensive measure and shouldn't be considered a criminal action.
6/16/2010,why not let it use 5 fighters but with a lesser bounus than the domi. that way it does less dps. but give it a logistics bonus so it is like a heavier logistics ship that fits between carrier and logi.
6/16/2010,"let it be able to fit dcu's, then it would be able to reach max of 1000 dps, which is fair compared to other sub cap ships, (the carrier with 5x dcu can reach 1500-1875(gallente) dps) - which i may add, it does nicely in sanctum/havens"
6/16/2010,"now switching to the anti sideso suggestion of less dps than a domi but with logistics ability, to be honest in high and lowsec a domi with rr's in the highs does a good enough job vs anything your going to have a chance of surviving, so the light carrier that was weaker in damage than a domi but with some leet rr would be overkill in almost everything and in a jumped by 20+ your still dead and loosing a cap ship, more over im sure ive seen a ship that gives cap's a run for their money with rr and are dps low from only having a few drones,................there they are logistics ships"
6/16/2010,have you folks ever looked at the cost of a fighter drone? a wing of 10 fighters has a higher mineral cost than a whole tier-3 battleship. you'd essentially have a whole freaking abaddon in your drone bay. that's insane on a subcapital. just buy a domi.
6/16/2010,no. bad idea from a bad player.
6/16/2010,"i really don't see anything that's ""overpowered"" here. either makes these changes (especially the first 4 for interdictors) or scrap the entire hull and replace interdictors with t3 frigs later on."
6/16/2010,"i for one am looking forward to walk in station, its a feature you can enjoy if you so wish, but your not forced to use it in any way!i for one would enjoy it, it adds another level of depth to the game"
6/16/2010,you'd rather have some more pretty flashy instead of fixing game mechanic issues? go back to wow.
6/16/2010,not supported. station walking is useless. there are many mechanics that need tweaking and doing something like station walking is a lot of work... think of all the character animations.unless they actually decide to add real mechanics that involve station-walking then it's a waste of resources. even then i'd rather see other stuff fixed.

6/16/2010,"loading video as bitmap frames into a game engine for rendering??why not just use a real browser?edit: wow, html5 video has market penetration in the single digits, doesn't even function in any browser without plugins added.flash is on 98%+ of computers.oh and ogg sucks, h.264 is the current accepted standard."
6/16/2010,"from how i understand it the browser is a separate process on you computer and is done locally ergo it works the same as a normal browser.some people still play in full screen mode i don't personally but seeing when i click any link opens in the igb it would be nice it it worked.if you dont realise html 5 and the video tag is being developed by google and the igb is based on chrome youtube is currently beta testing html 5 video and it works perfectly in chrome without plugins again which the igb is based on.this is one of the many reasons it as you eloquently put it ""sucks"" shy why not fix it instead of having another broken feature."
6/16/2010,"if only it was that simple. in practice you have multiple standards competing on the technical as well as the political level (corporate interest). a good read from the x264 developer from before google opened vp8 (which sucks, btw).oh, and not supported btw. introducing a browser into the game already brings enough security risks."
6/16/2010,the 90's called; they want their 80's era video playback tech back.
6/16/2010,"yes, video in the igb will definitely be a nice addition.they do. it's called chromium confirming that firefox, chrome, safari, opera and the next internet explorer are ""single digit marketshare"" this is wrong. and it is ****. and it doesn't even function in any browser without plugins, unlike html5.usually html5 video uses h.264 and aac for playback, there are even alternatives with matroska+vp8+vorbis.there is no html5 video implementation i know of that uses ogg, how misinformed are you?by the way, flash on youtube etc usually uses an old video codec that is not hardware accelerated on most systems, named vp6.you are right that h.264 is widely accepted now - because of html5 video/dvd/iphone playback using it. flash is late to the party though, and they still waste cpu cycles like there is no tomorrow for video playback.this was one of the most uninformed posts i've ever seen, and i consume quite a bit of them on slashdot.edit: and supporting it now, duh"
6/16/2010,"html5 isn't even a fully ratified standard yet. a lot of people are talking about html5 but there are major disagreements between major companies that could lead us to another browser war. honestly there is a browser war going on right now but generally speaking the public hasn't hurt too bad.there is a disagreement about the <video> tag and to which codec to use.the ""flash"" ability in html5 is called the <canvas> tag which is a proprietary technology patented by apple. not all browsers that 'support html5' support the <canvas> tag. so no, not supported. ccp has more important things to worry about than developing an entire browser on non-ratified, amorphous standards."
6/16/2010,this idea came for super caps at first but why not have a build date in ships attributes?
6/16/2010,"because the information would be lost when you repackage an item and stack them. in that case they merge all entries for the item in the stack to one database entry.this might be not as relevant for supercaps, but for every other item.so i dont see why we should add a special case for supercaps.not supported."

6/16/2010,i invite you to read the raw logs of the 3rd meeting of the csm at
6/16/2010,"] ankhesentapemkah > dierdra has done the same thing with his unfinished expansion and his issue was passed even though i argued against that, and now i do this thing and everyone is against me it seems. i find this odd and would say this is anti-ankh crap again.this was a petulant and childish thing to say, and she does it every time the vote goes against her. sokratesz could certainly have been more diplomatic, but that certainly didn't justify the behind-the-scenes threats that were apparently made, and frankly, he had a point. ankh shouldn't be surprised that people don't like her if she's going to a. have the well documented attitude that she does towards the pvping population and b. take it personally whenever someone disagrees with her!"
6/16/2010,"why, wouldja look at that, you just happened to fail to mention ank's hissyfit where she whines about how people had the nerve to disagree with her and goes on for quite some time arguing about how people not voting for her proposal must be because ""anti-ank"" sentiment. to say nothing of the fact that many of her suggestions are ******ed and advanced due to her complete lack of knowledge about pvp. we need to give people incentives for pvp in fw, really? and here i thought that the fact that there are ships piloted by other players there that give killmails when popped and drop loot was a pretty good incentive, and one that's good enough for the entire rest of eve. in any case, three meetings, three hissyfits. each time because of the same reason; ank can't behave like a grownup and isn't able to deal with disagreements without adopting a martyr complex. you must have accidentally failed to mention that, ya know, by accident and stuff. i think that many folks can at least empathize with sok. and really, while ank was having (yet another) temper tantrum over not getting her way, sok added one joke about how it was to be expected as she's now three out of three for going a bit bonkers over minor disappointments. the fact that he was told off for by dierdra is rather absurd, and it only happened because sok asked folks not to make threats to him in private conversations if they were going to. and mynxee is a fine enough csm delegate, her agreement with diedra's statements is troubling; it's all well and good to say that people can't try to give ank a hard time, but if ank is unrestrained and allowed to go bonkers once or twice every meeting, then she's the one who should be dealt with. ank's manifest unsuitability for the csm is the problem, not someone cracking jokes while ank goes buggy, yet again. and quit your bull****, we heard enough of it during the campaign. quoting ank is not trolling, just give it a rest already and find a new way to slander her honest critics, eh?"
6/16/2010,"so sokratesz has less of a hissfit? ""i have been threatened, the horror"""
6/16/2010,"did i mention how much i love space politics?i think i need to reiterate that i really, really love space politics."
6/16/2010,"stop being dense. tu quoque is a fallacy, not a great way to argue. and even that being the case, sok at least had a valid point. he was evidently given some sort of ultimatum off the record and it was confirmed on the record. ank, on the other hand, pitched a hissyfit (each and every single meeting so far) simply because she didn't get her way.do you detect a difference?"

6/17/2010,"i disagree with op.back in my fw days when it first came out, i remember hanging around in a fleet of roughly 30 people, sitting around in a system when someone would say on eve voice ""guys, i just heard that the squids have contested *insert system here*"", and the hype, confusion and adrenaline fueled race to that system that followed.plexes may not be every's pvp cup of tea, but plexes cause pvp whether you like it or not."
6/17/2010,bfish those days are gone. people have since realized that hide and go seek pve plexing is the optimal way to plex with the current mechanics. they orbit the button and finish the plex before anyone sees them. if they get seen then its often a mismatch leading to them either warping off or the other side not going in. there are exceptions but that is the general protocol - if you want to plex in an optimal way. people who used to do what you described have long since figured this out about the current occupancy mechanic. now the vast majority of fw pilots rightly think the plexing mechanic is too stupid to bother with. its time to adjust the mechanic so people will start doing what you describe again.

(prevent extending drone bay sizes)(2) would solve the issue of invincible drones (if your repairing, your not utilizing any new drones on the field, no pop in, repair, re-deploy - forcing out of battle/desperate combat situational usage)(3) would add a need for the carrier pilots to give up a slot (or another ability) to be able to utilize this ability."

6/17/2010,"as much as i like the idea, that might make the lach dangerously overpowered, especially if the hybrid bonus were dropped to go along with it. we'd then be talking about a ship with the firepower of a rook, a 44k ehp shield tank, and the ability to point to 60 kilometers. that said, there could be some virtue in turning the lach into a pure missile boat, if on the other hand you also turned the huginn into a pure arty boat. something to think about, anyway.fist, every race has multiple ships that require missile skills, including both minmatar and amarr. second, 400 dps out of a recon is excellent damage. third, short of mounting them on a ship with numerous specialized turret bonuses, as for instance to the zealot, eagle, and muninn, medium turrets simply do not have the flexibility or firepower to operate effectively at the ranges the lach should be operating at (40 km minimum). missiles do, and do so very well. as such they make an ideal weapons system for this ship. fourth, extending the missile bonus to cover hams would not force you to train any additional skill to use the lachesis effectively. what it would do is make short- and very short-range lach fits more viable. fifth, this is a matter of consistency. it simply makes no sense that the lachesis should be the only missile ship in the game to get a bonus to hmls and amls but not hams. in conclusion, it's clear that you are either a troll or not very smart, and should leave this discussion to people who actually know what they're talking about."

6/17/2010,bump. for feedback or sujestions.
6/17/2010,how would the game decide which targets to drop? because i know everyone has found themselves in a situation where they are shooting at a target that they locked after changing primaries. if you just dropped thier last few locked targets then they would have to change when there may be any number of targets you aren't doing anything with they just happened to be locked
6/17/2010,"good point.well, sensor damps are now ecm, so i would imagine, with that mentality, the best course of action would be something like,1) drop all locks outside of new dampening range (if applicable)2) does # locks exceed new maximum? if yes then 3, if no, stop.3) drop oldest locksbut that may unfairly hurt logistics ships that do power locking on each other first out of the gate. the most fair thing to do would be to make it random. your probably looking at only really dropping one, perhaps two lock on if they are also putting the range dampener bit on it.if you go with the newest locks, you hurt combat ships pretty hard, if you go with the oldest you hurt logistics ships pretty hard. so go with random, and you'll keep it more stable.-edit- on second thought, randomness would mimic ecm more... i'd say start with the newest locks and work your way down through the oldest locks. that way when you spin uyp your locking grid, you can pick and choose which ones would be the best to hold onto when this sort of tactic is in play, but the player would have to watch the ranges carefully to prevent the ship getting out of range before the sensor dampener hits.would encourage more ""balling"" style tactics with logistics, but would allow them to maintain their spider tank to each other fairly reasonably. though with the fewer locks they wouldn't be able to support the fleet as well, allowing more kills on the other offensive ships. sounds like a good balance.*added to description text in main body (drop newest locks first)"
6/17/2010,"this has come up countless times. its still a bad suggestion - feel free to eve-search the other threads on this for a huge list of reasons why this is either totally useless or extremely expoitable, depending on implementation.-1-liang"
6/17/2010,"i have done a search, and most suggestions failed to say anything more than ""oh, target lock reduction = win"". this is one of those suggestions that tries to find that ballance between ""totally useless"" and ""extremely exploitable"" that you lumped everything into.if you feel its a really bad idea, what would be your solution to bringing sensor dampeners up to usable levels?"
6/17/2010,"the damp nerf did more than just separate the scan res/lock range aspect of damps - it also adjusted the way direction that they stacked (if you will). this made for an extremely strong nerf of damp ships - which could now no longer damp someone down to web range and similarly had no ""lock time buffer"" with which to save them. it really made for tons of lolmails where nano ships just mwded up to the damping ship and obliterated it in a couple of seconds.so, then we need to examine the reason that damps were nerfed. the turning point in the damp nerf seemed to be a team of 10 caracals damping the other team out and killing the other team without taking any damage at all (hi pl!). so, i'd argue that it wasn't that damps were too powerful on bonused ships - but on unbonused ships. so what we need to do is unnerf damps for bonused ships and keep the nerf for unbonused ships. fortunately, these bonused ships have a bonus that can be increased to unnerf the module.of course, we're still looking at damps having been rather strongly nerfed because the module was ""cut in half"" so to speak. for that, i'd argue that the damp bonus should put unscripted damps at ~60-65% of where they were prior to the old nerf. this would mean that in the end, we traded cutting our module in half for the ability to be slightly more powerful at one or the other function.-liang"
6/17/2010,"i see you point, from the shift from old to new, and a shift for dedicated ewar ships back to the old would be a viable solution.i doubt that will happen.from my play experience, the problem with sensor damps is either up close and personal range (mwd counters) or pre-existing locks. if anyone sees a keres on the field, they lock up everything they can so to have a que of viable targets to shoot at while the new looong lock time takes effect. and in small squad / large fleet engagements its kinda useless as either you've allready locked every logistics ship and the primary secondary and possibly tertiary target and are sitting right on top of the ship set allready. the only way to make these modules work in those two, very common, situations is to get a lock break on someone (which requires ecm modules). by cutting down the number of available targets it makes it far more likely a target switch would need to take place, allowing sensor damps to be a viable e-war tactic as now there is a limited ability to force enemies to switch targets, allowing the range or target locking reduction to actually have a viable battlefield context."
6/17/2010,"i don't know if i've ever seen a damp ship using lock time scripts that wasn't playing support-support for an ecm ship. there just isn't any point in it. also, wtf is up with not having everything on the battlefield locked anyway?it used to be that the locks would break because they got damped to within 10km. and if they were already there, then tough luck you're using the wrong ship. even back then ecm was actually a better option - which really rubbed salt in the nerf-wound because they boosted ecm ships in the same patch they nerfed damp ships. i don't see this being especially useful. stop flying in blobs.-liang"
6/17/2010,"""whats wrong with having everything on the battlefield locked""thats exactly the thing that makes current sensor dampener usage very very hard to use effectively.sensor resolution dampening = if ships allready locked, sensor damp is uselessrange dampening reduciton = ship simply moves locks to much closer ships, useless in close range engagements.apply target lock reduction and it changes:with a #lock reduction, if they loose locks outside of target range (range dampening) it makes it more difficult to simply re-apply to the next nearest target, slowing down their reaction times.with scan resolution + lock reduction = targets loose 1-3 target locks, and if they need to switch to a new primary the increase in new lock times actually has a chance to make a difference in just how flexible that ship is in re-aquiring a propper lock grid.sensor damps arnt supposed to replace ecm modules with this sort of change, but rather make it more viable that the module will actually have an effect on player behavior, which is the goal of e-war. currently with the way sensor damps are now, the player behavior / combat effectivenesschanges the least in the most common battlefield situations."
6/17/2010,"i disagree with liang. i support this proposal.however, i would modify it so that existing locks do not break if target ship's maximum lockable targets drops below the number of locks it currently possesses (so it impedes the ship from acquiring new locks, or workable in conjunction with ecm.) or, existing locks break in the order of distance, in other words, farthest locks break first. this should eliminate possible exploits."
6/17/2010,"the only reason that range dampening is ""useless"" in close range engagements is because of the severity of the strength nerf. if damps were as powerful on bonused ships as they used to be, they this would not be a problem.i don't see this being an improvement over the way that damps are theoretically supposed to work.-lianged: and tritanius: support support isn't a viable role. if the damp ship is relying on ecm to break the locks then it is 100% useless. just bring another rook/falcon or focus on your tank and warp scramblers."
6/17/2010,break locks in the order of distance then?
6/17/2010,what a novel idea. what if it broke all locks outside of a specific distance?-liang
6/17/2010,damps are not locker breakers/reducers. they are range/resolution reducers. ecm breaks locks. not damps. liang is right that the nerf needs to be un-nerfed but it needs to be scoped only at specialised ships.don't you think its a bit weird how t2 ecm ships get double the bonus of the t1 hulls they're based on. but t2 damp ships get exactly the same as their t1 hulls!edit** t2 ecm frigates get 150% more than their t1. t2 damp frigs get same as their t1just double the bonus on specialised damp ships for a start and then sort out the scan res damp figures to actually be useful.
6/17/2010,how is that even an argument? you fully realize that it doesn't accomplish the same thing as range damps.
6/17/2010,"yes, and my contention is that i like the idea of how damps work now. yes, they need to be boosted a bit - but that doesn't mean that the mechanic itself was a bad one. -lianged: for the sake of the op, i also want to point out that sig amps give more targets as well."
6/17/2010,would be waaaay to op imagine what it would do to logistics chains. would then have to be changed to chance based and also be countered by eccm or similar module.thumbs down o\
6/17/2010,"signal amplifiers give you targeting range, scan resolution and more target locks. automated targeting systems give you more targets. they are in game already. is that the counter you thought wasn't in game? the fact that a module that was designed as a counter to rsd's also has the ability to increase max number of targets locked maybe even suggests that perhaps ccp had this in mind from the start but dropped it for some reason. i can see what the op was trying to suggest and maybe it makes sense. but i think its not the fix that is required."
6/17/2010,"my biggest beef with the ops suggestion is that it's attempting to redefine the role that rsds were supposed to play. they're supposed to shape the battlefield - not control the pace of the battle. a change of this magnitude would also preclude fixing the already broken mechanic as its now ""fixed"".-liang"
6/17/2010,"sun tzu: the art of war - i prefer the eddition by james clavell,shaping the battlefield is controlling the pace of battle. as it stands, sensor damps only poorly shape the battlefield in the way it naturally occours, rather than re-defining the situation to the betterment of the user.but a lot of good ideas all around the chew through. currently its come up about which targets should be dropped in the event of new max locks > current locks. for the most part, under ""normal usage"" a ship is only going to loose 1-2 locks for the first module and 0-1 locks for the second module thrown at it. with natural range dampening this just means that the ship will be unable to re-aquire new locks without breaking old locks. the problem of how to deal with closer range engagements needs to be addressed. here are some thoughts on it:a) drop locks baised on random chance (this would cause a mimicry of raw ecm, which is not what sensor damps should do, and could cause a great deal of unfair abuse).b) bais dropped locks on specific criteria - would create consistant behavior which is in line with the theme of sensor damps.1) drop them baised on most recent locks first. - would favor well planned locking grids (target high priorities first, i.e. core logistics spider tanks stay up) but penalizes any recent target switching offensively or defencively.2) drop oldest target locks first - would potentiaally instantly break existing spider tanking setups. favors offensive target switching, makes battlefield more ""chaotic"" as everyone scrambles to re-aquire high priority targets (op feels this is unbalanced)3) base target drops on range, furthest first - would double synergize with existing range dampening attribute and could be viewed as a double buff to to range dampening. target range reduction is allready adressed, and if that is the goal one should can allready load up range dampening scripts to the module. viable, but potentially abusive and overpowered, as then you only need target lock reduction to kill any locks past a certain point on sniper ships despite the users actions to plan a propper primary.4) drop the closest targets - i can't seem to justify this one.5) maintain all current locks, and no new locks can be made untill target locks drop below new existing number - would defeat the purpose of the synergizing effect of the mild-moderate target lock reduction rate. op feels that this would make the change self defeating.- now i realize that bringing back the old t2 ship bonuses would be a viable solution, but would make sensor dampening probably overpowered because it isn't chance baised and its a guarenteed shut down. so far all other appeals to correct this sort of thing hasn't worked, so i figured we could try thinking outside the box, give sensor dampeners a mild boost that would help synergize and make it more effective without becomming overpowered."
6/17/2010,"i think you have rather grossly misunderstood the concept of shaping the battlefield vs controlling the pace of the battle. shaping the battlefield means that you deny targets to your enemy wholesale - and potentially attack with impunity yourself. i recommend rereading section 6 on energy, but really the whole thing seems to have been misunderstood.you aren't asking for a ""boost"" - you're asking to totally redefine the role that rsds play (in a somewhat poor way no less).-liang"

6/17/2010,"if the proposed change violates some arbitrary rules that you constructed in your head, then fine, nothing i can say to change that."
6/17/2010,the proposal changes the role and usage of my favorite form of ewar. this is somehow a hard concept to understand? how do you think one would go about shaping the battlefield when all that really happens is they aren't able to lock as many targets? pvp in eve as a rule requires exactly one target to be locked anyway - even if you normally have multiple locked for convenience.-liang
6/17/2010,"""damps should shape the battlefield (whatever that means)"" is just a rule you constructed in your head, it has no real basis in the game. plus, op is suggesting a script that changes the functionality of damps anyway, so it won't affect you at all if you don't use that script. just like it technically only requires 200 dps to kill an avatar, right?"
6/17/2010,"and from this we garnish the great misunderstanding, as liang has failed to understand the purpose of the change. # of locked ship reduction is an additional attribute added to existing sensor dampener effects, which is why the boost is so relatively mild. with scripts you could make a sensor dampener specialize in reducing # of locks at the expense of the other attributes, but its not the only thing the module could potentially do. got a sniper fleet out, use your range dampeners to take it out of the fight, got a logistics ship, cut down its number of available locks and reduce its lock time (using 2 of the 3 available sensor damps on your arazu). im not saying make it the only attribute that it accomplishes.and this gives credence to my statement i believe lang is trying to troll at this point. lack of understanding the above content and insistance that she is absolutely right without propper counter argument even after her one valiid counter solution was given, accepted, and considered. and watch this: she is gonna have to have the last word on it.read the proposal. im not changing or hurting the current sensor dampening mechanic other than giving it a mild additional effect to increase its viability and depth of stategic usage."
6/17/2010,"you can use google or eve-search to see that this is a long standing understanding of how damps work and what they do. it's hardly some ""arbitrary rule i made up"". and tbh, if you don't know what shaping the battlefield is, i suggest you stop posting in threads relating to damps. but for your edumacation i can go over a couple of the ""tactical"" aspects of shaping the battlefield (indeed much of it actually is strategic):- destroy enemy key capabilities & freedom of action early- preserve friendly freedom of action...create windows of capabilities overmatch(source: us army)yes, and my complaint with it is that it moves damps an entirely different direction (different role - and an inferior one no less) and will discourage a fix to the proper usage of damps. no... most people really do use one target at a time. are you being deliberately dense/stupid/obtuse?-lianged: formatting."
6/17/2010,"lets be extremely clear: i understand that this is an ""additive"" change. unfortunately:- it pushes the role of damps away from shaping the battlefield (this is not the same thing as controlling the pace of the battle)- it drastically decreases the likelihood of an appropriate boost to the ability to shape the battlefield.- it is a largely meaningless boost since most combat in eve (sans logistics and ewar occasionally) requires only 1-2 locked targets anyway.failed appeal to authority, now some ad hominem to go with it. spectacular. -lianged: james, i responded to you specifically on the previous page. just to make sure you don't miss it."
6/17/2010,"first of all, the role of dampeners presently and in the past does not dictate what it ought to be in the future. second of all, just because i do not know a single military vocabulary does not render my opinion null and void.adding optional functionality can never make a module less inferior. ""proper usage of damps"" is another personal taste.it doesn't matter if most people really do use one target at a time. there is benefit for multiple locked targets even if you are just a dps grunt. for example, who do you think is going to win in this situation; fleet a vs fleet b. all identical ships. ships of fleet a can lock a maximum of 6 targets at once and ships of fleet b can only lock one target at once. you knew what i was talking about. so, were you being deliberately dense/stupid/obtuse?"
6/17/2010,"you know what,lets face it, troll has won, thread has been hijacked and de-railed, but i hope we can get constructive people back in here after a day or two.but since were digressing so far, ill bite.controlling the pace of the battle and shapping the battlefield are nearly the exact same things. why do we shape the battle field? to channel and funnel agressive execution to desired locations, which then removes aggressive execution from other areas. pace of battle goes up in one spot while dropping down in the other.tzu understood this, which is why he pushed his emphasis on all things outside of military tactics. the victory goes to those who take and maintain the inititive. and the destruction of capability or functionality slows the enemy's ability to utilize those things against you. inititive is not necissarily those who go first, but those that push the events that cause reactionary events in their opponent. the more reactive an opponite has to be, the slower their combative pace, and the harder it is for them to regain the inititive. thats the whole purpose of shaping a battle field, to push a reactive event onto your opponit, slowing them down.you quoted tzu and and army field manual outside of comprehensive context. if your curious, look into the german blitzkriege and the defense of stalingraid and how their emphasis on pacing inoder to shape the battlefield revolutionized 4th generation warfare.and here is a hint when you re-read tzu, like the heinline's book starship troopers, it is not meant to be taken at face value. but rather read and contemplated as a whole, pondering its implications and underlying tones."
6/17/2010,"of course, nothing is truly static and roles may be changed if ccp so desires. however, that doesn't mean that i can't squawk loudly when a player suggests a change of role that i'm not i favor of.i wouldn't normally think so, but you also were (are?) showing a deplorable lack of insight into the problem combined with an amazing unwillingness to examine the situation via google or even eve-search.i would argue that there's quite a lot of attention focused on damps - eventually they will be boosted. adding this optional functionality would almost certainly preclude fixing the already broken functionality. and i would argue that one can in fact speak on ""proper usage of damps"" based on currently existing game mechanics. its true - but its an extremely small benefit. in reality, the outcome will depend entirely on fcing. but even theoretically and with any ship you care to name the outcome will be extremely close - and with some ships it'll make absolutely no difference whatsoever (such as the artillery tempest).-lianged: formatting"

6/17/2010,"easiest way to fix destroyers is to add a t2 variant that would give a pg/cpu grid reduction or cap usage to small armor repairers/small shield boosters, and a 3.5% bonus to small armor/shield repair amount per level, or resistance bonuses.it would keep them from tanking cruisers but make them much more effective against frigs/t2 cruisers.current t1 destroyers are very good at being t1 ships. the current t2 inderdictors have their role and their nich and dont need a boost.all you need to do is add a hardier t2 combat version and you will bring them online and up-to-date."
6/17/2010,really cool you guys making this all public.ps. if there is some rule i missed about this thread being csm guys only i apologize.
6/17/2010,"the whole process is as open as we can make it and we welcome other players' comments about the issues we raise.due to the short time between the first 3 meetings, at8, preparing for the trip as well as getting ahead of things at work (so i don't return to a mess ) the edited minutes are still work in progress. rest assured i will be working on them at the airport tomorrow as i wait for my flight"
6/17/2010,"with the csm so closely scrutinized by the public when logs/minutes are released, consider the strategic implications of my responses to delegates' behavior in meetings before judging too quickly."
6/17/2010,what's next the race card... get over yourself.
6/17/2010,"i agree with finnagain that quoting out of context is a poor form of argument. may i suggest that he and his partisans on various threads stop doing so? at the same time, i appreciate venkul mul's providing us the fuller textual context when quoting dierdra vaal's spanking of sokratesz. an example of what finnagain and others should aspire to. if you read the various logs of this csm, you will find some members of it either acknowledging and/or cultivating an anti-ank bias. mynxee provides us a small example by trading on this in the post above. a shame really, given the professionalism she has otherwise demonstrated in the csm meetings. and still, folks like finnagain say that ank's commenting upon this bias constitutes an evidentiary claim for a melt down. finnagain, had you ever thought of placing that comment in the context which gives it a wider meaning? sujanra, had you bothered to read the substance of the whole meeting and its constructive interactions between ank and others? no. you cherry-picked a minor disagreement to created an excuse for more ank bashing. why? if finnagain's post is indicative -- and in the broader context of this debate, it is -- because she doesn't share a myopic focus on his kind of pvp. add onto this the coded sexist language about women having hissyfits, temper tantrums and the like. frankly, i wonder who is having the real hissy when i read your statement to me, 'and quit your bull*****, we heard enough of it during the campaign'. seems to me you folks have a special talent for digging yourselves in deeper and deeper. localhorse and others have thoroughly debunked claims such as yours about ank and pvp. in addition, i have been advocated for win-win approaches to developing the game to benefit all eve's citizens -- high, low and null sec. may i gently suggest you contribute something constructive as well? you might start by pressuring sokratesz and his kind to stop the trolling, both on and off the csm, and get down to work on improving eve. ironically, the day before this flare-up, i posted on sokratesz' need to act in a more responsible manner. i was quite surprised to see that need validated on the record shortly thereafter. dierdra vaal did the right thing in calling him out on his poor behaviour.you inadvertently raise an issue, however, that i think ank should take to heart. sokratesz has demonstrated his bad faith, and it is now an official part of the csm meeting logs. so are his partisans' bad faith, as recorded in this and other forum threads. because of that, ank should let this 'ank sentiment' issue drop. we all know about the bias. giving it more emphasis is a distraction from other issues, and provides fodder for trolling. how she constructively deals with this trolling is a more pressing matter. this brings us full circle to the broader meaning and advice of the original poster, casiella truza. with this in mind, i want to encourage ank to help shift the terms of debate by continuing to urge those representing special interests on the csm to join together in win-win solutions. this may mean graciously losing on certain issues of process or substance in this round of the csm. yet i believe a proactive effort to build bridges and foster a larger consensus remains a more important goal. it will set a proactive tone and professional expectations for future csms. and i hope that, over time, those who continue to troll will be marginalized from the mainstream of constructive dialogue and action. i don't know whether ank will take this advice. it isn't easy. it takes patience and discipline to deal with the truant behaviour of people like sokratesz. and perhaps ank doesn't suffer fools gladly. most strong women i know do not. yet at the same time, one must expect, adapt and transcend such behaviour in any politicized circumstance. delilah"
6/17/2010,"read the quote, sokratesz was scolded, not threatened."
6/17/2010,"i have read all these minutes and it is interesting you choose not to mention how many times ank complaining of anti-ank bias whenever people disagreed with her. i didn't know it was now considered sexism to disagree with a female's point of view. you also neglect to mention the schoolyard whining that occurred because dierdra vaal had an issue supported while ank's first issue was not. i also notice that there was no claim of pro-ank bias when her other issues were passed by everyone. could it be that the csm are voting on a per issue basis and not on who raised them? in that case why did ank vote against calling ccp to task for excellence? it would appear it is because she wanted her name on it too. i guess csm is now all about keeping score of how many issues you raise to justify your position. scolded for a fairly minor off the cuff remark. he claimed there was a threat in a private chat but as it was behind the scenes we can't tell for sure. mynxee appears to not want to reprimand ank for such behaviour because she quite rightly assumes people reading the minutes will make up their own minds.here is the section from meeting 3 with both ank and sok's comments in bold. judge for yourself who is the more unprofessional.[ 17:34:00 ] ankhesentapemkah > oh yes and why are you passing dierdras issue and discuss unfinished expansions which is basically the same thing?[ 17:34:08 ] sokratesz > flerp[ 17:34:40 ] dierdra vaal > i can see this debate going in circles already. just vote on the issue. its on the agenda so yes you dont need to pass it technically, but voting on this now means everyone can move on to the next issue with minimal drama. end[ 17:35:33 ] ankhesentapemkah > ![ 17:35:49 ] mynxee > ankh[ 17:36:04 ] mynxee > after ankh we will vote, then. easiest way to move on.[ 17:36:09 ] ankhesentapemkah > dierdra has done the same thing with his unfinished expansion and his issue was passed even though i argued against that, and now i do this thing and everyone is against me it seems. i find this odd and would say this is anti-ankh crap again.[ 17:36:16 ] ankhesentapemkah > end[ 17:36:53 ] sokratesz > in other news, sky is blue[ 17:37:38 ] teadaze > dv's issue specifically called them on the excellence issue. this fw is a rehash of previously passed issues[ 17:37:46 ] dierdra vaal > just vote guys[ 17:38:07 ] mynxee > all in favor of fix factional warfare raised by ankh?[ 17:38:12 ] ankhesentapemkah > excellence is a rehash of the unfinished expansion issue which i raised.[ 17:38:12 ] dierdra vaal > aye[ 17:38:19 ] ankhesentapemkah > aye[ 17:39:03 ] mynxee > all opposed say nay?[ 17:39:09 ] trebor daehdoow > nay[ 17:39:13 ] sokratesz > nay[ 17:39:16 ] mynxee > nay[ 17:39:27 ] alpha12125 > nay[ 17:39:35 ] teadaze > nay - already covered[ 17:39:47 ] ankhesentapemkah > lol double standards.sok is scolded like a naughty schoolboy for stating the sky is blue in reference to the 3rd meeting in a row where ank accused the rest of the csm of anti-ank bias whenever other delegates disagreed with her."
6/17/2010,"no problem at all, you've certainly earned the benefit of the doubt. and i'll leave the deeper political maneuverings to you until i get a crate of phone spiders. it's just a shame... many of us pointed out during the elections that having an empty seat would be better than someone who would actively work against the smooth functioning of the csm. hopefully it'll be limited to these temper tantrums when a vote doesn't go a certain way, but with all the damage ccp has done to the game (""need for speed"" eh, try a 1400-in-local fleet fight these days...), the csm has some very real work ahead of it. the quote that appears nowhere because it was in a private conversation, and we don't know what it actually was? yah... i don't think i can read that, and neither can you. but we do know that when it was paraphrased and brought up in public, that it constituted some sort of threat wasn't denied. something like ""don't say something like that again, or [insert consequence]"" is well within the realm of possibility. no, seriously, please come up with some new trolling tactics, we saw all this **** during the campaign. your game is getting old. now ank's own words that clearly say exactly what was claimed... they can be handwaved away because of ""context"". context that, just so happens, exactly confirms what people are claiming. but that is a useful troll tactic for you i guess... ank works to **** people off and the when anybody disagrees with her, all you have to do is point out how many people ank has probably ****ed off and then claim that ank must be a martyr due to how much people dislike her. seriously though, get some brand new trolling tactics; nobody has ""debunked"" any claims about ank and pvp. she has something like 8 kills in her entire career in eve, all those quotes of her from the campaign were shown to be 100% accurate and verified in context, etc... and yes, ank's proposals about fw largely show that she simply doesn't understand pvp, at all. the very idea that you need to do more to 'encourage pvp' than give people targets and free war decs that never expire just shows that ank doesn't get it. i mean, seriously, free war decs and plentiful targets, and they need more encouragement to fight??? enough already. yes, ank is now three for three, each meeting when she's voted down she pitches a little hissyfit and imagines an anti-ank conspiracy when there's nothing of the sort going on. every single csm meeting so far has seen the exact same ""minor disagreement"" come up. that minor disagreement is that ank is a paranoid and thinks that the other csm's are out of get her if they dare to disagree with her on a vote. ank is 3 for 3. let's hope she doesn't go 4 for 4, although i don't doubt you'd defend her (or more to the point, attack anybody who doesn't like her behavior) if she does."
6/17/2010,"there is not much to respond to in finnagain's post except simple reassertions of unsubstantiated claims, willful misinterpretations and a juvenile attitude. dee tearant, you have a more interesting response. one which i agree with in two respects. first, like you i agree that merely disagreeing with a female is not sexism. i do not agree with people who unreasonably shield themselves against critique by claiming discrimination. at the same time, coded language used as a placeholder for sexism and other invidious 'isms' is a well recognized phenomena. the meltdowns we hear claims of are in reality small, cherry-picked, political dust-ups. when placed alongside the over-the-top personal aspersions and heated rhetoric against eva as a person, i think it is reasonable to call to account some people for implicit or hidden sexism. this doesn't mean, of course, that you are being sexist. still, i would respectfully ask that you and others explicitly reject such sexism when it occurs, and call others to account for it when you hear it. for a long time, i've thought bigots speak poorly of our 'mature player-base', and it is little wonder that women shy away from eve. they are certainly not people i or my mates want to be associated with, and we have very strict rules about respecting diversity in our corps. i hope this is true for you and your mates as well. second, i do not think there is anything wrong with ank standing up for herself. sometimes, calling attention to those who scapegoat us is one way to do that. i think we have all experienced being the scapegoat at home or at work, and felt the need to dig in our heels and say something is wrong or unfair. that said, as i hope i made clear in my last post, it is time for ank to move beyond this concern. to stick with it will be counterproductive, egg on trolls, and detract from more important issues. so you have a sense of my intentions, i intervened in this debate partly because ank represents an important element of eve's citizens that deserves to be heard, and partly because the smears and fictions swirling around her detract from real issues that the csm should be dealing with. it was necessary to separate fact from fiction in order to move us along. for instance, one of the real issues is the inevitable (??) rebalancing of pvp between pirates and anti-pirates. ank pushes strongly for this. the potential loss of protections and privileges that pirates currently enjoy is a major source of vitriol against ank. i realize that the need to rebalance pirate/anti-pirate pvp is a point of view that some may not agree with. but i would rather have it debated on the merits, that through a personal politics of slurs. finally, i appreciate you taking the time to quote a substantive extract from the record. you are not trying to misquote by leaving out the immediate context. nonetheless, may i ask you to please consider the larger context of dierdra vaal's scolding. he's not scolding sokratesz for that one remark per se, but responding to a particular remark representative of a larger pattern of truant behaviour. there is a wider context than just those raw logs to consider here. now we can argue the merits of whether sokratesz or ank is worse. i don't want to do that. i'd rather we push all the members of the csm to act in a professional and productive manner. so i've publically called upon ank to set her concerns with scapegoating to one side. perhaps you can join me in asking sokratesz to stop trolling. and in the future, we should call to account any of them who engages in behaviour that detracts from improving eve for all of us. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
6/17/2010,"seriously, just stop lying and stop trolling. it's not hard, and you'll feel better. nothing was ""unsubstantiated"" or ""misinterpreted"". you're a bootlick for ank and if you could catch me in a mistake, you would have. instead you just make stuff up in order to troll. enough lies, enough of your sadly predictable behavior. enough nonsense about how the truth about ank is a ""smear"" if you don't like it. you are entitled to your own opinions, not your own reality. can you post honestly, finally?"
6/17/2010,"ankh is thoroughly unqualified to be a csm member, as her actions have demonstrated. she has shown repeatedly that her primary concern is not the csm or eve but herself, and furthermore whenever others disagree with an idea of hers she accuses them of anti-ankh sentiment. frankly, there is one person and one person only at fault for any anti-ankh sentiment on the csm, and that is ankh. her insulting statements and petulant, childish behavior are more than enough to explain the existence of anti-ankh sentiment.as for sexism, please. she would be just as awful and unqualified if she were evan jobse instead of eva jobse, and i would be just as outspoken in my belief that she is incompetent and unsuitable for the csm. i am quite certain that finn would as well (seeing as he's my alt, after all). furthermore, while i do not know your gender, delilah, i am entirely prepared to state based on the contents of your blog and your statements on this forum that you do not understand eve, do not understand the concept of ""play,"" possess an entirely unjustifiable and arrogant sense of moral superiority, and, quite frankly, that you are a moron, albeit one capable of stringing lots of words together. as far as i am concerned these statements would all hold true regardless of whether you are male or female.perhaps if ankh were willing to behave like an adult and accept defeat gracefully, instead of engaging in passive-aggressive behavior, insulting other members (as she did to teadaze) and blaming ""anti-ankh sentiment"" for every time a vote fails to go her way, then that ""anti-ankh sentiment"" might go away. instead, however, she has behaved in a manner similar to that of a temperamental child, throwing tantrums whenever she fails to get her way. such behavior harms the constituencies ankh was elected to represent, and, ironically, harms her own reputation and political position. evidently, she lacks the maturity to recognize this. so, sadly, do you."
6/17/2010,"my, my gentlemen. thank you for demonstrating what a real hissy fit looks like. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
6/17/2010,"of course. although delilah is just trolling, as the very first thing it says about sok in its blog post is that sok had a ""hissy fit"". evidently the troll is only against such comments when they're applied to ank. or maybe we'll see the earlier troll that was trotted out during the campaign that if you respond to an insult with a similar insult, the second doesn't count and 'context' totally eliminates it, no do-overs and no backsies! edit: evidently i was in too late and it's now trolling some more here, too. ""hissy fit is totally code for sexist beliefs... except when i use it!"" and, big surprise, still no examples of anything i got wrong or ""misrepresented"", because it's lying about it."
6/18/2010,"i hope this is one of many tactical overlay upgrades! at the moment i dont use it at all, and it could be so useful as a tool for fc's.."
6/18/2010,"i agree, mabe i would accauly fly my redeemer if it was more epic"
6/18/2010,"i like the premise to this.to reduce the uber blob events, you could push the idea of arena style capture points, each fw side only gets so many ships within a particular compound. but that could lead to alt abuse and other implications.but if there was some way to emphasize small, well formed squads inside of complexes duking it out, you could remove the npc's and let the factions honestly go at it.i mean, you'll still have the massive combat in the systems exteiror to the compound, those are allways fun, but once inside it would become more tactics specific rather than shear numbers specific."
6/18/2010,"allright, lets face it, eve is well over half a decade old and is still going toe to toe with current generation mmo's.star treck online in and of itself has many similar features that eve-online is trying to catch up to (planetary exploration, walk on stations and ships, pets, etc). the difference between us and them is content. we have a much stronger history and player base than the newer mmo's. but ccp does need to compete with the newer games that are being released.eve online was so successfull that it has become the model of spaceship mmo's out there. they follow us as a model and add new features. for the health and survivability of this game they are pushing features to match current generation games and racing to add new content that will superseed their competitors. as a result, a several existing features are being neglected.i say we change this up a bit and ask ccp when they will dedicate an entire expansion to game balance / issue fixes and ask for a fixed interval (such as once every year or year and a half) where that is the goal of such a development cycle. lets face it, eve needs to be able to commercially compete with whats out there inorder to be able to keep this game world alive and healthy.as players lets keep that in mind before we chomp at the bit and scream bloody murder.though sensor dampeners and blasters do need some serious love...."

6/18/2010,i fully support this concept.
6/18/2010,looks good
6/18/2010,"be careful what you wish for.despite my avowed love of drones, being a gallente weenie, i see some major problems with this proposal:1) it's a massive buff to drones.2) it makes missioning in a drone-boat even more fire-and-forget than it already is.3) the compute requirements of implementing this drone-control algorithm in a large fleet fight where there may be hundreds of drones on the field may be a wee bit onerous.from a practical standpoint, you are much more likely to get a proposal through csm and implemented by ccp if it is concise, targeted, and easy to implement.an example is the proposal to let people see the status of drones in the drone-bay. this is a leftover from csm4 but it will get attention in csm5 after iceland. i personally would also like an option to ""launch (damaged|undamaged) drones first"", but that's another story."
6/18/2010,"not supported. -""drone tactical inferfacing"" - we don't need another skill to train up. i know technically this allows the drones to target stuff like targeting/multitasking but ultimate this just boils down to a skill train that allows me to use an ui.i don't want to train this just like i wouldn't train windows .net forms to level 5 just to fit my ship.-mining drones: this idea just gives the macrominers more power. it makes an easily macroable task more macroable. orca + mining drones + .9 or 1.0 system walk away, come back in a few hours you have 10 roids of ore in your cargohold. that's not even using a macro. -engage ewar vessels: no. there are already *plenty* of ways to counter e-war. ewar ships are paper thin and this will make flying any ewar ship a guaranteed lossmail. for example, i warp in on a battle in a falcon, decloak and jam something. instantly 30 or so warrior iis race towards me. i need to either warp or i will die. way too overpowered.i don't think these suggestions will make drones any easier, it actually makes it worse. game-breaking suggestions aside all of this just makes it more complicated. i will admit that the drone ui is a little clunky, but honestly it's not that hard. right click -> engage target. i agree with the csm member, a simple and easy to implement solution will work better. you can arrange drones into groups. what might be an simple solution is to have assignable hotkeys to these groups."
6/18/2010,yes! +42! towels are definitely the ultimate answer! i would even buy a faction towel from the eve store if they were available.

6/18/2010,simple proposal. don't f#@k up sisi during the tournament. it is used by teams for practice. by f@#king it up you are resulting in teams not practicing and thus lots of frustration and lame predictable setups in the tourney. alternatively have some other test-ground for practicing.this is in direct response to the screw-up happening for at8 where we can't assemble ships on sisi. this is particularly unfair to smaller alliances who don't have a mass of people with every possible ship sitting assembled in the hanger.

6/18/2010,completely agree that at a minimum the aggression timer should be visible and updated. i'd be satisfied with only this change.but i also think it's extremely odd that the time period where i am allowed to shoot you is made longer by me shooting your stuff.any null-sec application of this (shooting ratter's wrecks to increase the aggression timer) is also wacky and shouldn't be used as a reason to keep this funky mechanic.
6/18/2010,"since you're obviously new here, let help you remake your post into something that might garner something other than the more obvious trolls.1. present an actual argument. do this nao! is not an argument.2. present reasons. unless you're talking to a small child because i said so is not a reason.3. try not to rehash ideas that were discussed to death and dismissed six months ago.as a side note, ccp already reduced the scan timer once (i believe) from 2 seconds to slightly over 1. it seems extraordinarily unlikely they'll remove it, since if they were going to, that would have been the time to do it."

6/18/2010,"yes, because everyone that disagrees with you is a troll. well, this is almost correct - it seems like your implication direction is incorrect though. you say that the goal is to funnel violence to a desired location which removes it from somewhere else. however i would argue that the goal is actually to limit your enemy's options for attack as much as possible (to the point of outright elimination if its at all possible) - but certainly away from your vulnerable/weak aspects. sun tzu agrees and goes on at much length to praise victory without loss.i understand what you're saying, but its a very tenuous argument that slowing their combat pace is equivalent to eliminating and restricting their choice of target.sure, i was trying to stay under the character limit.well familiar, actually.yes, and i think you might want to re-read it.-liang"
6/18/2010,"yes, because disagreement is trolling. but feel free to try again in a few days - i'm sure you'll find me on the forums waiting for you. as i have been for the last four years.so who is being disrespectful - the guy that says ""oh you don't agree you must be trolling!! look how smart i am referencing sun tzu! oh you are so dumb!"" or the guy that says ""um, hey guys... this is really quite a change in game mechanics, the role of this particular ewar, and really wouldn't do much to affect anything outside of rr blobs anyway?""-liang"
6/18/2010,"lang, its not that you dissagreed with me, if you noticed i was completely civil untill you started crossing a line, and becoming disrespectfull in pushing your opinion. i acknowledge that a boost to the t2 specialized hulls would correct the sensor dampening mechanic. however, that change has not been made and doesn't look like it is trying to be made. this is an alternative. i stated both without mallace, and you continued to choose to insinuate that it was the only viable alternative and that my idea was bad, insinuating that i was an idiot:""there just isn't any point in it. also, wtf is up with not having everything on the battlefield locked anyway?""that i was a poor player:""i don't see this being especially useful. stop flying in blobs.""and that i my idea to change the way sensor dampining fuction was fundamentally wrong:""i don't see this being an improvement over the way that damps are theoretically supposed to work.""and then we got into the semantics argument over pace of battle and shapping the battlefieldi was quite polite and constructive with the disscussion up to this point. you made an honestly ignorant statement and i tried to point that out to help in your understanding of what i was saying as i felt there was a disconnect.that ignorance still persists:and your fixation on the term ""violence"" when i used the term ""aggressive execution"" shows me that you googled those quotes and tried haphazardly to make them fit your argument and have not made any serious attempts to study warfare outside of a casual passing intrest.""... but its a very tenuous argument that slowing their combat pace is equivalent to eliminating and restricting their choice of target."" again, failure to utilize comprehensive context of the aims of this proposal. i am not looking to force target choice, but increase the likelyhood that there will be some penalty, some impact, on player behavior with the use of sensor dampeners, as the premis of my whole argument here is that as it currently stands, sensor dampeners have the least impact on player behavior of all the ewar modules.and yes your a troll. you can't let it go, your making shot single phrase arguments and waiting for reactions.and you have to have the last word. just watch."
6/18/2010,"the point at which you became uncivil was when i challenged your understanding of sun tzu. seriously - shaping the battlefield and controlling the pace of the battle are entirely different and have different goals to boot. controlling the pace of the battle does not (at all) control where the battle occurs, simply the pace at which it proceeds. obviously, if you slow the enemy down and you are similarly unphased then you will trivially win. however that doesn't mean that you will deny important/juicy targets to the enemy as it would if you had shaped the battlefield.they are different.wait, what?i do understand your goals and aims - i just vehemently disagree with your proposal for a variety of reasons. comments:- rsds are not in fact the least impacting ewar. tds are utterly useless against more than half the ships in space while tps simply don't affect the enemy's behavior at all.- your suggested change is not in line with the current idea behind what damps do [role change].- your suggested change would almost certainly preclude a boost to already existing functionality.- your suggested change ignores the fact that damps would remain largely useless in the majority of fights in eve since having 1-2 targets isn't that big of a detriment unless you're in a logistics/recon or in a massive rr blob.if i were trolling you, i'd be responding in kind by pointing out your terrible grammar/spelling and returning your ad hominem attacks. unfortunately all i'm trying to do is pound some sense into your head.-lianged: you did some editing to your post, but i'm not really going to go try to figure out what all you changed between when i read your post the first time and second. this is one of the reasons i settled on this ""ed: $****"" thing so long ago."

6/18/2010,"again, obvious troll is obvious.give it up. i already gave you victory as a troll for hijacking this thread.-final word denied-"
6/18/2010,"how about you try refuting some of my specific complaints?let's start with:- if this is an ""additive boost"", why should we add functionality to an ewar system before fixing the already broken parts, especially in light of ccps tendency to ""boost"" something and then leave it alone for years at a go?- if this is not an ""additive boost"", why should we abandon an almost working mechanic instead of fixing it?- why should we change the role of damps in combat?- are you planning on adding a targets locked script for sensor boosters, and are you aware of the difference between sensor boosters and signal amplifiers and what role they would have in your proposed scheme?- why should we add a mechanic to the game that specifically nerfs logistics, recons, and rr bs gangs and leaves the majority of combat roles overwhelmingly unaffected? do you feel that logistics ships in small gangs are somehow overpowered and in need of being specifically nerfed?- you claim that this will slow down fleet combat, and provide an optimal way in which it will - yet you seem to have put no thought into how this ewar can be almost totally mitigated even without fitting a counter.-lianged: btw damn sad when the ""troll"" has to convince the op to continue being on topic with the thread instead of devolving into name calling."
6/18/2010,wow really?final word denied.
6/18/2010,"although i agree with pat that liang can be fairly agressive with her arguments and sometimes obtuse, she is in many situations, including this one, correct. i'm not saying that everything she says is wise and wonderful and we should all bow down to the wisdom of liang . far from it in fact. i encourage civilised arguments.but she is correct in this instance. 1st, fix the damps bonus on t2 hulls2nd, add additional features."
6/18/2010,fiar enough. =)any other ideas floating around out there?
6/18/2010,"well.... i put a big list of things i'd like answered up. presuming you're willing to have a civilized discussion, you could try to answer them.-liang"
6/18/2010,how about this: make a script for the dampeners that cuts a hole in the targeting from 0 to [a range based on some numbers]--[ship]-(space it can't target)-[space it can target]-- that would also make sense as blaster ships are close range the only bad thing about this is that if you had 2 ships one with that script and one with the range reduction you could lock a target completely
6/18/2010,your talking about a reverse distance dampening script... that would be a novel idea. just how could you find a technical explination on how it could work?it would cause issues for toe to toe fighters and favor distance ships...or are you more of thinking of between x+3 and x+4 = no targeting?
6/18/2010,"tbh, as long as the currently existing damp mechanic is fixed first, i don't have a major objection to additional functionality. but you've never answered my query as to how you believe this is going to affect normal people in eve. most combatants will be little more than annoyed by having their number of targets lowered, since at most you really care about the primary and maybe secondary targets. and really - even if you are annoyed (it won't be much more than that) it would require no more effort on your part to alleviate than targeting the offending ship and sending your drones after it. continue with your business afterwards.no, the nerf almost specifically targets people that need large numbers of locks to do their job - like rr bs gangs, certain recon pilots, and all logistics ships. i might be able to see arguments for wanting to nerf rr bs gangs (though i disagree that we should be nerfing teamwork so heavily). what i don't see is that recon and small gang logistics pilots need specifically nerfed.-lianged: final sentences of first paragraph"
6/18/2010,"i'm thinking about dampening the targeting from 0 onwards from the affected ship but not that far maybe 15 km at max with a rigged recon and fleet bonuses and maybe 5km on a normal ship and i also haven't yet got an idea how to explain it...or maybe i just have...how about that it generates signals around the targeted ship(a) that get reflected, and ship(b) within a certain distance of ship(a) bounces those signals of again an confuses ship(a)'s targeting...and why don't the signals confuse the sensors of ship(a) with the first hit?"
6/18/2010,"fortunately, you don't have to make an rp explanation for why your suggested game mechanic works. it just has to be balanced gameplay - and on that note it would be so much more powerful to damp their minimum lock range than their maximum - because there's so much more power available to close range ships (nos/neuts/webs/close range weapons/etc).i'm not sure it could be balanced - especially as long as both styles of range dampening existed.-liang"
6/18/2010,"oh, sticky particles, like quickly decaying radio isotope that sticks to the targeted hull, projecting a prevailing cloud of interfearence, particles would have to be continuously applied inorder to maintain sufficient cloud density to interfear with the locking mechanism. though we might still have issues explaining why you get a nearby refractory or overwhelming background environemnt but still achive distance or long range energy wave integrity... perhaps it does something with the wavelengths ability to alter direction while within the field. that could give plausibility. would need to be fudged in the name of sci fi, but could be doable.sounds like it would almost need a seperate module to be scripted. as the current sensor dampener mechanics work off percentages, and what your suggesting would work best with a mathmatical equation. perhaps the module starts with a range of 1.5km (t1) and is affected by skills (+500m per skill level), and then altered by ship bonuses (10% per level or so up to a maximum of 5-7 km.(t2 with bonuses or so). do you want this device to mimic web or dampener ranges?but yes, it does feel mechanically it would be overpowered, especially against frigs and close range gank ships but it might go somewhere interesting."
6/18/2010,"keep the current way rsd's work by simply reducing range/resolution. just boost its effectiveness when fitted to specialised ships. the lachesis is currently best fitted as a shield tanked gallente hac. not as the rsd king it should be. once this is fixed then maybe, just maybe we can talk about additional features like max target locks effected by rsd's.oh and the reason why rsd's seem to be the wrong ewar for gallente ships is because you are looking at it from the wrong perspective.my enemy wants to engage me at this range where they know my very powerful weapons are useless and their weak weapons can still reach out and touch me. so i will force them to fight on my terms. at extreme close range where i have all the advantages.a picture to illustrate the point.x = gallante shipy = enemy (caldari) shipz = the target of either<-----> = effective range of weaponsx<------------>.............................zy<----------------------------------------->zhowever if i remove the ability of my enemy to even target me at ranges beyond my effectiveness i force them into my engagement zone and out of thiers to be blasted to bit by my super powerful blastersx<----------->..............................zy<----------->..............................zi know what you are trying to achieve by making the enemy useless at the range that blasters want to operate to essentially be used as a defence but then the enemy will just want to be in the other (medium) bracket instead of the blaster (short) bracket.this is what liang was trying to show you. this is how rsd's shape the battlefield. unfortunately, resolution dampening is ineffective on its own. it is however very, very effective when coupled with ecm."
6/18/2010,"spug, no arguments here. forcing close ranged engagements with blaster-style ships is the fundamental purpose of sensor dampeners. im just entertaining the idea on how it could otherwise work. i would never seriously propose a change like reverse range dampening, but its fun to give conjecture. =)but as far as the target locking reduction, currently sensor dampeners are not working. the t2 ewar ship fix would fix the problem and issue of poor specialized sensor dampening suffers from. its just that change has not happened and in my opinion, is not going to happen. so i am trying to explore and propose a possible change in the sensor dampening mechanic that might adress the issue and make them viable without becoming broken."
6/18/2010,"those that trade know that this window could use a few small adjustments that would drastically increase the player experience.1. filters - let me filter the data in the window, so i can narrow it by region, or any of the other columns. 2. order adjustment status - if i can change the order why not change it's color or add an icon or something to let me know it's in my power to change with my current skills.3. multi-select. let me select multiple items and have the stats at the bottom apply to those items. then i can see my projected return based on the items i've selected.

6/18/2010,i suggest the removal of the scan resolution penalty on black ops. this would free up a mid from the need of a sensor booster... while you're at it maybe a rework of the black ops bonus... a 5% agility bonus to the gallente blops. wtf?!
6/18/2010,imo black ops should could fit covert cloaking device
6/18/2010,no they shouldnt.
6/18/2010,"something needs to change with those ships. the fact that they are weaker than all other battleships is a problem.i almost wonder that the whole black ops, jump portal making, no-covops-cloaking thing might work better as a black ops command ship. a battleship should have some firepower behind it- otherwise it's just more expensive for no real benefit."
6/18/2010,"giving them command bonuses to their respective recons does sound like something, but recon gangs are already pretty solid.how about giving them bomb launchers? and a special cloak that gives them away on the overview, but not target-able, if x amount of people are on grid?"
6/18/2010,the blackops is not a solo ship and with its niche of covert ops behind the lines it is pretty good already.bombers as its associated dps (400+dps each) + recons for the ewar part make a pretty deadly gang if you ask me.a little buff on range for the covert portal might be nice.
6/18/2010,"not supported because of the subject line. oh right, and the completely garbage presentation of whatever this proposal is supposed to be.."
6/18/2010,"even with a portal/jump range buff, the actual combat side needs some looking at.-liang"
6/18/2010,"imo it needs some more jump range and preferably a huge increase in capacity for fuel (bridge and jumping). as for combat abilities their dps is good enough (700 on lowest, 1.1k on best), but their ehp sucks, some proper resists or better base hp's would help."

6/18/2010,"if what you're asking for is a report card on how well ccp handles support, then supported. (should be easy)i don't really care about trying to improve it because i'm sure about 90% of petitions are user error and even then response times can be pretty quick. within minutes for some petition types.what i'd also like to add is that support needs some watchdog mechanisms because a lot of times the responding gms can be total ****s, or at least inconsistent. compared to the mass volume of petitions, they usually handle things quickly and efficiently. but when a petition takes some thought more than 'unstick pilot' or 'reset mission' there is the opportunity for gms to be unpleasant and leaves the customer with a feeling of being screwed over."

6/18/2010,"well, since anomalies generated by the pda respawn immediately after completion, defining them as either ""good"" or ""bad"" based on the total amount of isk in them isn't a good way to go. instead, define them in terms of the amount of bounties gained per tick. judging by my experience and the ratio of battleships to frigates and cruisers in the sanctums, if you ran the ""bad"" sanctum all day, i'd bet that you'd make more isk than if you ran the ""good"" sanctum in the same amount of time (plus, you'd have more opportunities to pick up the escalation).as for altering the distribution, the low-ends (below hub) are mostly pointless. i wouldn't alter the quantity of havens or sanctums, but sacing most of the low ends and throwing another forlorn (or forsaken) hub into the mix would be welcome.as long as we have to put up with bugged anomalies, at least.so, support taking another look at the distribution."
6/18/2010,"we already have insane amounts of isk generated on a daily base because these anomalies never cease to respawn. havens, sanctums and hubs are already enough to support up to seven or eight pilots at a time, and we aren't even talking belt ratters or miners. you should consider talking to your alliance leadership to install these upgrades in more systems so that there is more opportunity to continue your isk grinding."
6/18/2010,"however it was ccp's stated intention that between ratting and industry upgrades to cram as much as 20 people or more in a single system so that alliances could run themselves at a profit to all in a single constellation or less, to encourage smaller alliances, to encourage more people in 0.0currently as everything less than a hub is basically ignored its now <10 in a non mining system, and until ccp lets us build the upgrades (no idea how) the freighter move of the last upgrades is prohibitive (even with jb networks its still a pain) at least now we can get the bits for ihubs and move them in jump ships without a freighter per ihub"
6/18/2010,one can actually run the complexes in pairs to increase their spawn rate. that would actually be the objective of the game: cooperation. it is very easy to hit the 20 mark (and remain profitable) if you abolish the thought that you have to be alone to make isk.

6/18/2010,"i certainly could have filled the roster to overflowing with proposals i support. but there are factors at play which affected why i did not raise the issues you linked: the time it takes to prep an issue for presentation in a csm meeting (some take longer than others, some are likely to be more controversial and need more research to be able to champion them in an informed way), the goal of keeping csm meetings to about 2 hours, the potential amount of time needed for the summit agenda discussion related to negotiations with ccp about what was important to csm and needed time, the fact that 8 other people were entitled to raise issues for the meeting and might do so at the last minute, and historic precedent suggesting that a max of 8-10 issues per meeting even when there is no summit agenda discussion is a realistic goal. i know you're scathingly skeptical about the csm process. tbh, i welcome this--it's good to know that players care enough to hold us to task. i hope we can demonstrate some accomplishments over the next several months that will chip away at that skepticism. bear in mind we were just seated 13 days ago and required to be ready for a summit a mere 17 days after taking our csm seats. also remember this is a volunteer activity; all of us have rl obligations--some of them considerable, especially so given they must be managed to permit us to extract ourselves from them to go to iceland for essentially a week (without pay in my case, i might add, since i don't have sufficient paid time off on the books to use for the trip). on a side note, the amount of time required for csm activities is significant. even at half my normal consulting rates, the ""free"" trip to iceland doesn't come close to compensating for the hours i've put in. not complaining (i was aware of the time it took even if you did a half assed job), just stating facts.give us a chance. we will have 10 meetings between the june and december summits. i can pretty much guarantee you'll see the issues you linked--and many more--raised in csm meetings and submitted for consideration at the december summit."
6/18/2010,"what can we do to give you what you need, in terms of information and research towards an informed presentation?you're in noir, you already know everything i know therefore about how those folders were used, because it's entirely likely we use them for exactly the same thing, keeping track of members of dozens of entities of interest. i'm hearing that certain industrial and trader types used them to keep track of entities of entirely different interest.as the folders were stored on our pcs it seems to me that ccp would not be easily able to make themselves aware of just how many people used those folders, thus making them a low priority in terms of functionality to be lost.as yes, i'm throroughly skeptical about the csm being in a position to rectify this issue, even to the point that even if it did raise it, and ccp did fix it, that's not even proof that it was the csm that prompted the remedial action. in so much that ccp developed eve and corrected errors long before the csm existed.but since it's here, and since it's rammed down our throats once a year, and since ccp like to pretend they listen to it, and since it pretends it listens to us, let's see how that works out. (assuming that csm5 doesn't implode and ragequit, no judgement. i certainly would have by now)i appreciate it takes a lot of your time. it's a shame that time is effectively being wasted by a ccp that takes your ideas under advisement and files them under b. when they're talking to the csm, which internal ccp budget do you think they book the hours to?"
6/18/2010,you keep using that word. i don't think it means what you think it means.
6/18/2010,"sexism means the same thing as ""smear"", ""distortion"", ""debunked claim"", etc... something that's true and is unfavorable about ank."
6/18/2010,"you don't really have much room to talk after the essays you wrote.thank you for your unfounded accusations! i actually read the raw logs from all the meetings, thanks. in fact, i agreed with most of ankh's proposals! the only one i didn't was the one the csm voted down! i've also supported a proposal or two of hers on the assembly hall. between that and the fact that i voted for myxnee, i find your accusations of sexism hilarious.it worries me that you are completely unable to find a middle ground here. ankh must be right, all the time, and everybody out to get her is a troll or an idiot. i don't think she's a good delegate, but she's had some good proposals and i (and the csm) will support them as they come up. it is, however, ridiculous to gripe about bias every time your proposals get voted down!on the other hand, yes, i do think that sokratesz's behavior in regards to the whole ankh situation has been unprofessional. i think that after they've both been elected, they can manage to coexist on the same council without the backbiting and childishness that both have exhibited. it's an internet spaceship council for christ's sake. lighten up.also, i completely reject the criticism of myxnee i've seen here. i think she's done an admirable job of staying above the drama and keeping the csm on task."

6/18/2010,"yeah, since we cant enjoy huge fleet fight drama any more, csm drama will keep us going."
6/18/2010,"thanks for your reply sujanra acoma, actually, i don't think you and i are that far apart. we both agree that ank should drop the complaint about scapegoating, and sokratesz is behaving unprofessionally. we also agree that sokratesz and ank and the rest of the csm should be expected to work cooperatively and productively together.please note, however, that there are multiple themes to this thread. its not simply about whether ank is justified in griping or not. for that reason, i cannot simply blame both sides equally. or fail to place the dispute in the context needed to understand it fully. simply blaming both sides wouldn't be a middle-ground position, it would be a 'false balance'. i'm not saying this is what you were trying to do. rather i'm explaining why i push back hard on the misleading claims of those who want to make this all about ank. it is more complex than that. my preference is to see this discussion move towards professional expectations of the csm. if i'm interpreting you correctly, you are so inclined as well. as for mynxee, i too think she has done a good job of chairing the csm. her wink and nod on this thread was a departure from that, and one that i hope won't happen again. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
6/18/2010,". yeah... the context is that ank had a hissyfit (each and every single meeting so far) because people dared to disagree with her and sok made a joke about how, yet again, ank was having a hissyfit because people were disagreeing with her. the reason is you're a partisan shill, and you're willing to lie and troll to support your chosen candidate. there were no ""misleading"" claims. that's just one of your trolling tactics; something is true and you don't like it, so rather than debunking it you just call it false lots and lots and lots and hope you can trick people. and of course it's all about ank. nobody else has had three hissyfits over the course of three meetings when they get voted down. your partisan shilling must be a bit easier and you're rubbing your hands in glee once sok made an off the cuff joke so you can try to divert attention from ank's repeated pattern of temper tantrums. what luck. conspiracy really comes naturally to you, eh? now mynxee is out to get ank too. go figure."
6/18/2010,"just 2 things.i expect the csm members act mature, whichever side it comes from.remember one thing and one thing only csm delegates, you are chosen to represent the playerbase, nothing more and certainly nothing less.as for finn(not)again.you must be one bored gamer. or you just have a personal grudge versus ank, because checking back reveals that in the passt few weeks most of your posts are regarding ank in some way or another.just for your information. regardless if you agree as how she got voted or that she got voted is of null concern. your acting like don quichotte and ank is your personal windmill. it's way passt amusing and it's more closing into the point of pathetic.so my dear csm delegates, do that what you are voted for and make this game more enjoyable in general, for the carebears and the hardcore pvp-ers and for the griefers and scammers."

6/19/2010,"think the gallente have been nerfed long enough. before the speed nerf, people feared our blaster boats, now it's just lolblasters."
6/19/2010,"as it stands, i am better off with a drake then a nighthawk in my style of pvp... this isn't very logical, and is all because it lacks a mid slot and some grid."
6/19/2010,"my pi wishlist1. inter-player trading on a planetprobably by allowing materials in a customs office to be contracted to another player.an alternative would be to permit inter-player links on planets, with a new contract type to define a type of product, quantity, and price. this would then permit the player accepting the contract to route materials along that link till the contract was fulfilled, at which point the isk would be released to him.2. pi apilet us monitor our pi setups externally to the game.3. offlining structureslet us construct more pin's than a cc can support providing that no more than the cc's support limit are operational at once - similar to pos module onlining.4. abort operationslet us stop extractors and rescan.5. action queuelet us queue up 1 action on an extractor, up to 12 hours in advance. eg. set a 23 hour cycle going at 6am one morning, then rescan anytime from 6pm the previous day to have it start at 5am the following morning.6. upgrade cc's without destroying the whole network7. improve the scanning systemrather than just letting us see the coloured bands, let us also sample a site to see what the extraction there will be - within skill moderated accuracy limits.8. quadruple storage silo storage and halve powergrid."
6/19/2010,"pi is abysmal... yeah, it can produce the stuff you need, but it's a mindless chore suitable only for macros.quoted from my other thread on the same issue here:"
6/19/2010,either fix the rockets or remove them. it is just distracting and confusing to have weapons in the game that are useless.i miss my hawk./support
6/19/2010,"looks good, except for the new skill requirement. supported otherwise.it would be even better if there were a ""zero transversal"" option: for non-sentries, tells drones to match speed and direction with the target once in optimal range, as opposed to trying to orbit the target. this would increase the drone's dps at the risk of the drone being shot dead if the target decides to fire back."
6/19/2010,"that's all that's really needed imo, the rest of the suggesitons is way too much power, and would break the concept of the game, you're not supposed to not have to do anything."
6/19/2010,.
6/19/2010,not a big drones user but this is good
6/19/2010,"please make the arrows more noticeable. get rid of the lame shadow that hovers on the horizontal plane! make the arrows void to other graphical effects! sometimes the arrows seem hidden by the space background...please fix it and make it more eye-friendly...kthxbaiedit: oh and one more thing...the sphere's are so ""graphically"" intensive. zooming in dramatically reduces the fps. please make it more simple and not so visually annoying."

6/19/2010,do you people have nothing better to do other than making crap up?is life that depressing?welcome to eve online... iq of greater than 10 required to play.
6/19/2010,i will support this. but its a wast of time. ccp wants a pvp game. there claim its a sandbox is bs. it's only a sandbox if you pvp. as everything in eve out side of high sec has pvp taged to it. thats what 75%+ of the game. so if you have landed on eve and like space ships and pve you got a shelf life of mybe 1-2years. if you have hit that shelf life its time to start pvping or move on to a better pve game.sorry thats just eve and ccp will not be happy till high sec is as empty as low sec. o well.edit: as a result i have a friends list from 3years of playing that has over 100 pilots in it that i have pve'd with in now dead corps all redlighted. well not all from the people i know mybe 10-15% are still green but they have moved on to pvp or gave there accounts to someone that do's. my accounts will go red at the end of this billing cycle now too.
6/19/2010,"so if are running missions for the ""fun"" of spending hour after hour killing the same ai mob over and over again then you can simply pick any of the hundreds of agents that don't put you into harms way instead of whining up the forums with more drivel. the rest of us are playing something a little more involved than a predictable arcade shooter."
6/19/2010,"that is most likely why he made this topic, only people with iq below 10 do missions in low sec border systems.(to op: just move to mission hub, that is what ccp is trying to achieve with lol-loadbalancing, just give freaking dynamic agent quality of they want real load balancing)."
6/19/2010,"this is a pvp game. quit crying, htfu and learn how to deal with it or gtfo."
6/19/2010,furb killer - i think you meant to say that people who mission in low sec are generally of an iq far greater than this particular idiot of op as they obviously know what's at risk.8)
6/19/2010,"boo hoo, life is so hard isn't it?"
6/19/2010,"since the test server is meant to be used for bug squashing and not for testing new fits/alliance set ups, be glad you could use it at all.."
6/19/2010,customization is always fun and if it can be done without adding much more work on the servers... then yea why not
6/19/2010,"there is a larger issue that many stupid countdowns are not visible at all. they should fix all timers and make them visible. it is seriously ******ed that timers continue to be broken after many years.actually there should be a way to figure out a way to live without dumb timers. also, remove hi sec."
6/19/2010,"supported. i don't think your aggression timer being extended from someone shooting your wrecks makes sense, but at the bare minimum, it shouldn't be possible to use this to extend your timer without you knowing about it."
6/19/2010,"didn't know about this. the timer extension is all well and good, but when the extension is invisible...? supported."
6/19/2010,"i thought this was deemed an exploit years ago and fixed. i'm disappointed to see that that is not the case. ccp, please fix the aggression counter to at least display the correct time left on the aggression."
6/19/2010,"by your horrendously misspelled logic (i mean seriously, don't you guys at least have spell checkers on your web browsers? christ.) the missions should be in 0.0 since that is where the most risk is."
6/19/2010,it was actually one of the most supported topics to ever be posted in assembly hall. the old topic is locked and it is still a major issue that negatively effects the game and is universally hated.
6/19/2010,its really not that bad....
6/19/2010,"seems to me the op is talking about what ecm should be, not damps. i think they both need to be looked at frankly, but i agree that bonuses for ships would go a long way to fixing damps in the meantime."
6/19/2010,"ecm works perfectly fine now. the reason ecm got the fix it required is because it was very overpowered and the *****ing and whining on the forums was epic. mostly because of ""ze falcon""it seems when something is underpowered, just a little, like rsd's are, people have a little moan about it. a post with a small following, then it eventually dies and gets forgotten about because everyone accepts that its weak. if you want rsd's to be useful you need to really ramp the whining up into overdrive and get enough people to support you with a very good proposal (increase rsd effectiveness bonus from 5% to 7.5% on keres and 10% on lachesis/arazu)"
6/19/2010,"i really wonder about that last statement, suggest you take a look at eft's lock time calculations. if its the question of taking another rook or lachesis in your gang i know what i'd prefer.can we get some numbers on old and current rsd strength ? and the proposed 7.5% and 10% / lvl on rsd platforms ? that would be enlightening."
6/19/2010,"thats why you want fast lock speed when you have sensor damps on your ship to hit enemies.can it really be so hard to grasp?you sensor damp long range ships so they are ineffective.you sensor damp ships to make them shoot at the ships that are closer (these are the ones with tanks if you're smart, imagine that).you sensor damp ships to make them come closer to you.its the same with tracking disruptors.you td ships to make them have to use longer range ammo that hurts a lot less, or they have to get really close to you, into your range. all of the sudden you turn the td off and now they're losing effectiveness in the fight because they're using a low power charge at close range while you've turned off the td to preserve cap, not only that but you can switch charge to tracking for the td, and flip it back on, now the other person is fighting with lol damage ammo at short range with almost half of his tracking neutered, so he's doing lolwut damage.thats how amarrs fight anway. superior guns and armor, and modules to force the enemy to do what you want them to do, i.e. get closer and die facemelt style."
6/19/2010,"i just wondered about this. i imagine the way it works now is done for a reason (or it might not). let me show you.as far as i'm aware currently in game it's this:you --------------------------- targetlocking target -------------- they see nothingtarget locked --------------- flashy yellow bracketsfiring on target ------------- flashy red bracketshow i sort of expected it to work:locking target -------------- flashy yellow bracketstarget locked --------------- non-blinking yellow brackets**firing on target ------------- flashy red brackets** or you could have non-blinking red bracket, but maybe yellow is better, because yellow is still somewhat in realm of 'non-aggressive' act, and keeps things clearer. in fact, lets add something else (just actually thought of this). if someone is firing a hostile module at you, i.e. weapons, ewar, etc., keep it flashy red. but maybe it could be changed to flashy green brackets (or flashy blue) for a supporting module like tracking links, remote rep, etc. however, it would get complicated if you got someone firing a hostile and non-hostile module on you (why they would be doing that, i don't know - but it's still a possibility that could happen and would need to be considered)anyway, the main point was that i thought it might be more interesting if you could see when someone is locking onto you. i realise you would lose the element of surprise, so perhaps no one would want it changed - and that's fine. but right now for example, a battleship could be taking ~20s to lock onto a smaller target and they wouldn't know about it until pretty much the instant the battleship fires. thoughts? :o(i'm aware of passive targeters and how they show nothing even when you engage a module on target - i just tested that on myself. but this is nothing to do with them.)"
6/19/2010,everything in this proposal would be a nice change. good to know whether that battleship is targeting you to remote rep you or to kill you./signed
6/19/2010,"wouldn't it be nice to be able to watch the alliance tournament from in-game?since igb doesn't support flash, we can't do this...why not add an ""evetv"" module to our ui, and broadcast /all/ (or at least, a lot) of events?"
6/19/2010,"given the igb is based on chromium, they could html5 video support in the long run."
6/19/2010,a surprising level of support for such a tiny proposal :3
6/19/2010,"and have the deliveries hangars sortable like our own personal hangars (because they have tons more crap in deliveries than personal hangars, by far).i kicked the last csm until they brought this up, it was almost unanimously supported, and died like 99% of anything else brought up by the csm."
6/19/2010,very much supported.
6/19/2010,"i'm not really sure, tbh. here's the workflow that i follow. yes, i love making flow charts! this one was hastily done to respond to this thread however, so it probably needs some refinement. (i would like to document other csm processes this way, as an aid to help players understand what we do ""behind the scenes"" and future delegates work in consistent ways.)the two research tasks involve considerable effort because finding information in forum and wiki formats that are inconsistently worded, not tagged with keywords, etc., is very tedious. we unfortunately lack of a good tool for tracking proposal status, assigning keywords, sorting/filtering by various criteria, etc. teadaze's csm database is a great tool that helps but is limited in scope and features (although i'm sure he intends to continually evolve it). and even with a tool, the discussions for proposals posted in ah is vital. but from the perspective of researching, aggregating, and managing the mountain of data contained both here and in the wiki, we're crippled. that's a whole other rant, though . i suppose the best help players could give is to assist with the research for proposals they post or support and post relevant links to related threads or wiki pages. some do this now, but as it involves :effort: and people are often unwilling to invest more than a minimal amount of it, i am unsure how to inspire folks to do more.in my dream world, proposals are submitted, tracked, cross-linked, etc., in a csm-managed database with a nice web interface. i do have a vivid imagination, considering this is only the year 2010."
6/19/2010,"i am not skeptical about the csm. rather, i am quite optimistic about it. i think the idea is a good one. ccp has real incentives to make this work, including past troubles with trust and transparency, the growing possibility of direct competition, and the recognition that player insight can help them develop an even better cosmos. that ccp made the csm a stakeholder in the development process not only speaks to these incentives, but speaks well of ccp. moreover, if we look at the work output and overall professionalism of the csm itself, it is fair to say the csm is doing its best. one may disagree with something or another, but that is not a reason to decide that the initiative will derail before it is barely out of the station. lets not let perfection be the enemy of the good. i also appreciate the transparency with which the csm is conducting its business -- flowcharts, databases, wikis. i hope the notion of a csm portal comes to fruition in the near future. thanks to all of you (e.g. mynxee, teadaze, ank) for your work on these tools. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
6/19/2010,"eh... elaborate on the ""protection and privileges"" that pirates enjoy? since from what i can see, any neutral fighting vs a pirate (outlaw) will have a very big advantage on their side. i would say that neutrals have too much protection in lowsec.and if i need to refresh your memory, this is a list of disadvantages pirates have in lowsec:- we can be killed & podded without any penalty.- when fighting on station or gates we will have 300dps against us from the guns.- we cannot assist any corp mates on station or gates without getting gun aggro, unless neutral players, who can assist their corp mates on a station or gate.- above reasons 2 will kill anything below a bc if there for more then a few seconds.- when killing a pirate, usually 50% of the damage will be from gate or station guns, so yes, they hurt alot.a non-pirate fighting a pirate will not suffer any of these penalties, and will be at a decent advantage. so, tell me, what is this ""real"" issue of pirates having too much privileges?"
6/19/2010,eye-patches and parrots
6/19/2010,i am glad your responce excelled in pure genious. but i actually didn't expect more than that.thank you for confirming my thoughts about you though.
6/19/2010,"hello killer gandry, thanks for writing. i think the vast majority of us reading these threads couldn't agree with your views on the csm and other matters more. delilah"
6/19/2010,"see, it's smug crap like this that annoys me. you're just as bad."
6/19/2010,"no, seriously, you're not even good at trolling. you've not upsetting or even really annoying, you're just embarrassing yourself by farting angrily at me.troll better."
6/20/2010,black ops certianly need looking at. i would say probably more than any other ship in game currently.
6/20/2010,"unlike titan pilots black ops pilot aren't prisoners of their ship, so this comparison is pretty moot. the qen numbers would be a lot more useful if they gave the number of chars owning a black ops. but the the qen is mostly about delivering irrelevant numbers."

6/20/2010,"bumpblasters are made to be the weapon made for landing on the person at 0 and melting them before they can say oh ****. that is the blasters role, be at point blank and melt everything within the zone of death.ps:cross training to amarr more range more eph 10-15% less dps but true dps applied at optimal is seems to be the same."
6/20/2010,"i have to admit, blasters have ridiculous range compared their damage. like op says, more damage or more range. but giving the ""role"" of the blasters i would go with 25/75 on range/damage if you ask me. more damage is the way to go imo.supported"
6/20/2010,"change gallente boats damage bonus from 5% to 7.5% (like vindicator has)it will solve several problems:1. quick temporary solution. ccp do not have much time for fine tuning gallenete race.2. it will boost hybrid weapon of gallente ships but not caldari (actually caldari have optimal bonus for all hybrid weapon ships)3. this boost will not change gallente tactics as extremely close range fighters.p.s. for those who say ""it will not solve the problem of applying dps"" read item ""1"" p.s.s cross training to minmatar ships. they are very good for pvp: cap independent weapon, fast ships, have slots for neutralizers, selectable damage type, very good range due to falloff, tiny auto cannon pg requirements"
6/20/2010,oh god yes. so fail.
6/20/2010,agreed i want real carriers and supper carriers not the little toys the children play with.
6/20/2010,"both carriers and supercarriers need to be larger. i was messing about with a friend's chimera in my machariel and couldn't help thinking ""how the hell can it possibly fit a machariel inside that puny thing"""

6/20/2010,"i just stick to calling them motherships, and yes, they should be larger."
6/20/2010,"obviously reading the tl;dr didn't give you enough info and i'd advice you to read the whole proposal.being able to not repair your weapons while in a safe environment is unique only to carriers.i must disagree here because i have thought of these problems.1. this can be solved by an easy equation the total in drone repair + drone bay should never exceed drone maximum drone space2. this is why the repair rate will be very slow, if you wish to do something close to pop in/pop out then you will have to activate triage with all it's side effects.3. if it were a slot based module it would have to be a high slot one to not penalize one race on slots, however i feel that this should be a baked in feature into the carrier class."
6/20/2010,here are my 3 wishes1. contract courier to co2. corporation hangar at co3. trade market at co (separate hangar such as corp hangar) (uses only the local resources placed in this hangar) *apply taxes where needed*
6/20/2010,couple of this i would look forward too :1. links allowing interaction with other players to the same planet2. ability to flow items from spaceport into storage (if you have an import sensitivity set-up the spaceport gets cluttered and expedited transfer is too limited in volume (storage is only 5k) and in time.regardsnodles
6/20/2010,good plan batman.
6/20/2010,"i think you're right about space port to storage. since launch pads have the ability to send stuff to orbit why should that make them the only structures able to have returns. you're sending stuff down to a planet so you should be able to send it anywhere, logically speaking, right?another thing about pi that doesn't make sense to me is command centers. as it is now, i can plop one down anywhere and set up my whole operation elsewhere. as long as i have it on the ground i can some how 'magically' use its powergrid and cpu to power my industries. thats kinda weird. i suggest making it mandatory to have it connected by link. also get rid of cpu. theres no reason for it practically or imaginitively. think about it, why do you need one localized cpu to run numeral facilities stretched over hundreds to thousands of kilometers. that wouldn't happen, every facility would have their own computers.it doesn't follow logic and its intended limiting factor is non existent. get rid of cpu altogether please.i am also a proponent of making command centers movable. you should either be able to move them or place a new one without disturbing your other structures i say.support*the 500 m3 storage at cc is useless too, just get rid of it"
6/20/2010,totally agree i'm now struggling how to upgrade cc with preserving my current structure... impossible. i think i'll do screenshots and just put pins in same places... lol?storage should take half of the pg of launchpad imo.i agree.+1 for thisyup +1i'd also like to list some stuff but i guess i'll put it into new topic.
6/20/2010,"from wikipedia:we can already import and export several levels of 'settings' in eve, but something that in my opinion would enhance the game experience is an option to store them ccp side. this would make it a lot easier for people (like me) that run several accounts on several different locations quite regularly, but it would of course benefit anyone who occasionally logs into eve on a different computer.things it should include: + graphics & performance settings+ overview & broadcast settings+ chat channels+ location of ui elements (chat windows, overview) at a given screen resolution+ ability to store several profiles+ ability to export/import to xml filesall this convenience can be had at the mere cost of a few kilobytes of data per character, which with the current eve population would all fit on a single 1tb disk, with enough room to spare in case the entire population of earth suddenly decides to subscribe to eve.as you can see i have also come up with a terribly unoriginal name but the voices told me that clouds do not usually form in space.- sokevelopedia page: soon"

6/20/2010,there is no way to fix blobs. have you people not goten it yet. blobs are what keeps the servers on in iceland and keeps eveonline going.here is why. eve is a pvp game mainly but it was well basicly failing at geting the needed numbers of players though pvp. so they did great promo on sandbox and you can do anything. you all remeaber that right. and numbers started rising rapidly. you see this numbers were not people that like pvp this were people that like pve. the pvp people that played eve were not going to keep the servers on so they had to get pve players into there game and make both pvp and pve players think there geting what they wanted.so this is how you keep pve players in a game they like doing pve content they love in a pvp game. it's the only real deturent pve players have to combat pvp players. it's the blob.if your a pve player you dont realy like pvp so you blob the crap out of the people that jack with your pve content. now its fair and = becouse pve players dont like to pvp they only blob to get to the new cool pve content placed in pvp zones. and it works becouse pvp players hate blobs there no fun for any pvp player ether. so both side's hate the blob just as much for differnt reasons. and that makes it all work out. becouse the blob keeps pvp players away from pve players for the most part. if pve players did not have this blob they would have no real deturent against pvp players. why is that you say all they need to is pvp back well thats the problem if pve players did not have a way to make pvp unfun for pvp players with the blob pvp players would never leave the pve players be becouse remeaber this are pvp players and pvp is want they want and would pvp the pve players till the pve left game and then you dont have the numbers to keep the servers on again. there for ccp has to keep the blob.as a side note it was a smart real life bussness move by ccp.
6/20/2010,for real come on we all know eve is a pvp game not a pve game thats why the pve sucks. why spend time on devleping pve when the pve in this game never mixs well with the pvp?edit: i only say this becouse if they do put good pve in and not fix the pve v pvp problems its just going to make pve cry post of the past look soft. as it is right now the pve is not worth realy fighing for thats why the omg there sending me to low sec for level 4 and the wtf i have to go to low sec now for all level 5 post small and omost nothing right now.put realy pve in the game and the cry post about having to pvp when trying to get to good pve content will go way beyond the pale.so be carefull what you ask for is all i'm realy saying.edit: as a side point alot of pvp players post on the boards much like they like kill boards becouse pvp players need to know what other players think or feel. pve players will not flood this boards but they will in mass flood ccp mail boxs pve players when they have something to say aobut a game go right to the top becouse they dont give a damn about pvp players or what 2 cents they have to place in it all.
6/20/2010,"i fully support this concept. think if you could take sides of a npc corp that takes incursions in the null sec in a pve event. on the other side ppl would take the side of the enemy corp. this way, solo players could engage in pvp and pve at the same time (to avoid bringing massive ships you would have frigates, stealth bombers restriction.. etc). pve should replace some of the pvp issues (you don`t encounter massive battles every week..)"
6/20/2010,supported +1
6/20/2010,"make the bonus to range and lower the bonus to rep amount.thats it, no big block of text. the 7.5km range is completely unacceptable when even a bad bump from quarter speed can push you out of rep range."

6/20/2010,also we want covert cyno's damnit
6/20/2010,"t3 remote-rep subsystems really could use a bonus to range, 7.5km is very short."
6/20/2010,"yes! and i want a subsystem for the hictors bubble mod!and all 4 races should get a mod for their secondary ewar (painers, damps, tracking disruptor)and revisit the other mods that are not used much, like the one that gives bonus to overheat i think that one should get a 20% bonus per level"
6/20/2010,"hm i haven't checked on this in awhile. unfortunately the previous csm did not agree with me but i have received a lot of support both here and in-game so i am definitely going to bring it to the attention of ccp in iceland and if necessary, will write a new proposal and raise it again."

6/20/2010,the shadows are awesome because it shows me the plane the planets are on..
6/20/2010,in my personl opnion is that rorquals should be able to make a jump bridge for other industrial ships like exhumers and orca's. my reasoning behind this it that the titan is the largests combat ship and it can take other combat ships with it in a jump bridge. the black ops ship is the largest of its type can trasport other covert ops ships with it. so why cant the rorqual transport other mining ships with it? because it only seems fair that the roqual is capable of that. it states in the description that its the center peice for a deep space mining operation so dosent it only make sense that the center of a deep space minning operation should be able to bring through a jump bridge the ships its meant to support?please feel free to leave feedback it would really be appreciated.
6/20/2010,"ill support for the t2 miners, but nay to the orca."
6/20/2010,"the rorqual already has a 1 million m3 ship maintenance bay, enough for 5 hulks.it also has the ability to field a clone vat bay, meaning you can jump 5 hulks to destination, the pilots can jump clone to the ship, unload their hulks and mine all day."
6/20/2010,i'm a bit surprised that this is not getting more support. guess not everyone reads these threads.tell your friends to post in this thread and support if the agree!
6/20/2010,"one of the core ideas of eve is ""risk vs reward"". right now, that doesn't apply to trading. often, taking a lowsec alternative between two trade hubs gives almost no improvement in time saved, while greatly increasing risk and effort.many hubs actually do have good routes - specifically, all the routes coming out of rens have long hisec routes to the other 3 largest hubs, and short lowsec routes.jita->amarr is obviously the worst, with 9 jumps for the hisec route, and 24 (!) for the next-shortest lowsec route.what made me create this topic, however is jita->dodixie. right now, you can go through the uedama pipe for 15 jumps, save 3 jumps by going through tama (lol), or save just one jump by going through oletteirs. none of these are big improvements for the risk they add, and i as a trader would like to see a combination of an increase in # of hisec jumps, and decrease in # of lowsec jumps, so that i actually have a decision to make when choosing which route to take. this would improve the risk/reward curve, increase the number of ship blowing up, and bring jita->dodixie in line with most other routes between trade hubs in terms of availability of lowsec shortcuts."
6/20/2010,"they could instead make the highsec routes even longer, eve already is way too small and easily traversable"
6/20/2010,eve needs to be more dangerous not safer.
6/20/2010,"what happens when a trade hub stops being popular in favor of another one? it's happened before. jita wasn't always the big, or even significant, trade hub in eve. in fact, as far as i know, the only thing ccp has done to support specific trade hub systems has been node reinforcement, not world shaping. how would you make sure that changing the travel time between hubs will leave the hubs intact?"
6/20/2010,i would just let it be and see maybe we would then get more smaller hub which i think would even help the server and would be more fun as the universe would get bigger and so onactually i would like it a lot that all 4 empires get split by low sec and even null sec (yes null sec but there should be much more low sec pipes and only a few null sec ones wich should a hell of a lot faster though ) exept for a few loooooo...ooong high sec routes that would bring a lot more live into low sec and it would support traders hiring mercs for secure passage or even paying the pirates
6/20/2010,"well if they would know they wouldnt be doing missions in low sec border systems.if you want to do missions in low sec you take an agent at least a few jumps into low sec, no one with an iq above 10 takes a combat mission into low sec from a high sec border agent, it is just suicidal with no gain."
6/20/2010,"enable them please. i want to be able to launch a bomb ""near"" a gate to destroy this cute blob...i'm seriousfrom a faction warfare point of view this makes sense to me. one of the main complaints from all sides are the blobs. huge number of ships from both sides attack each other constantly. lots of people don't like it. but not all the time.lots of people would like to avoid the blobs of course. but it doesn't work all the time. using bombs would level the play field in this area. how ?if the bombs are enabled in low sec then it would be sure that blobs would still form up but it would influence them to be either smaller or big fleets would form up rarely this time. theres also the fact that logi ships would appear more often i believe.for those of you who don't know, you can still get away from a bomb's radius if your fast enough. you can also withstand a bomb's damage if you got enough hp. usually cruisers and up. so you have a couple of choice with this if you want to survive a bomb. either jump or warp away.stargates ? if you hit a stargate then you get hit by the guns and you get a gcc. disable gcc when the bomb hits the gate ...but not neutral ships of course...well no change here except that when a bomb hits a gate then you wont get a gcc...unless it hits a ship like low sec rules applies here.am i mad....probably lol"
6/20/2010,"how about no.low sec outside of fw is mostly solo/small gang combat and bombs are just another option to **** people up with little effort(since bombers are close to untouchable for most ships that work under sentry agro).i see your point, but blobbing is mostly a fw problem and should be sloved by changing fw somehow, not by allowing very powerful aoe weapons in a environment where they would do more harm than good."
6/20/2010,perhaps sentry guns and security effects need to be looked at. lord knows the low sec needs some serious help.i too would like to be able to field bombs in low sec but it presents a lot of problems that aren't dealt with in the proposal and those would need to be tied to it inorder for me to support it.
6/20/2010,there is nothing wrong with sentrys(you might remove them in 0.2 and 0.1 to make pvp more interesting in the deeper systems). they actually promote small gang/solo stuff(since you need a ship that can be tackeled without bubbles to fight at gates).the problem is that you can kill any solo ship/small groups that can fight under sentrys with 2-3 bombers(or at least do enough damage to finish it up easy). keep in mind that is with ships that field a cov ops cloak and have the full control over the engagement(read unkillable if you not screw up) and most ships that can solo under sentry fire can't do **** against cov ops cloaked frigs(if they are not totaly ******ed) in a bc or bs.
6/20/2010,i like that 0.0 and low sec are different. bombs = 0.0.-liang
6/20/2010,"how about, er, no?also sentries are fine. if you want to gatecamp in something like two dramiels, two stealth bombers and a falcon go to 0.0."
6/20/2010,"seems to me the gate guns would pop the sb's as soon as their bombs went off. furthermore any amount of sb's needed to actually destroy large ships like that would be pretty obvious coming in. even if they were all in bc's or bs's they prove a problem to a gatecamp as you describe it. it seems to me your problem with bringing bombs to low sec is that you think bombs are unbalanced, and they are not. simple as that."
6/20/2010,"that ^^and the fact that technically in low ssc your suppose to get protection from the gate guns if your attacked but did anyone did have protection ? i mean why is there guns at the gate in the first place ? when theres a bunch of bs at the gate (and red) your screwed if they catch you.bombs on the other bomb (better in a group) would allow to retaliate on that bs gatecamp.except for a no as an answer, please give more details as to why this is not supported. maybe a ccp dev will look at the answer and actually do something ? (yes, its a wet dream for me that ccp will actually listen to me or us and actually do something about a problem and find a fix to it)"
6/20/2010,the gate guns would kill the bomber *after* the bomb explodes. just killing the ship for launching the bomb would be stupid. i could launch it into free space just to show my friends how it looks. so if i dont hit. the gate guns wouldnt have anything to say. and if sentries only fire after my bomb hit. i am mostlikely warped out already and sit cloaked on my safespot together with my other bomber friends and enjoy the tears in local.though i have to say no aswell. bombs are a 0.0 tool.
6/20/2010,"maybe a change to the gcc would apply here then. once you launch a bomb and let say you hit a neutral. i would assume your already cloaked back and in warp somewhere. so...usually when you attack someone with a bomb, the reaction is when the bomb hits right...thus giving time to cloak and/or warp out ? so when you attack someone at a gate in low sec or high sec, you immediately have a warning because the gate guns knows who your hitting right, missile or turret ? why the hell is it different with bombs ? a simple change to this mechanic and when you launch a bomb or when a ""pirate"" launch a bomb, the guns lock you down...if they do, you can't cloak, make sure you have time to warp out because you will die since a sb is really weak in hp.it would make sense since the gate guns knows who your targeting, if not, it should know. that would put some balance to this idea. you still could get away but not cloaked. that way the gate guns and your survived victim could attack you back."
6/20/2010,just curious ... have you ever worked with bombs so far?a normal bombing run look like this:- warp in- align towards the target and the warp out spot- decloak- drop bomb- hit warpunlike missiles you dont have to be on the grid fo the explosion.so how would the sentries know that my bomb will hit and how would they stop me from insta warp?

6/20/2010,"i find kinda annoying that when i enter to planet view mode i can't switch between planets colonised by me. i'd love to see some kind of maybe drop down menu with list of colonised planets so i could switch without leaving planetary view mode. of course there have to be a mechanism that won't allow you to switch to planets out of your 'command' range. located maybe above build/scan buttons where current planet name is.another thing that i would like to see much more automatised is surveying for materials. it would be cool if one could shift+click same type of extractor, select few of them and choose same deposit range. it's boring clicking like 5 times same buttons to get same effect."
6/20/2010,"to change view from planet to planet, yes that would be cool but admit it, you click exit, then you go back to your planet tab and you choose another planet.for your second idea, now this i like a lot. automated commands. i would also add the addition of another feature that would survey and choose your select time (5h or 23h for example) automatically without any action from me.supported. simple yet very useful"
6/20/2010,"as everyone who competes in medium/large fleet warfare is aware, lag and node deaths cripple these type of fights most of the time. currently one solution ccp has implemented is node reinforcement where you can petition for a node reinforcement 24 hours in advance and they will reinforce the system for you and hopefully it will help to take the stress off the server.this works (up to a point) when for example when you have a starcase structure coming out of reinforced status and you want to attack/defend it plus expect a response from the other side. ...however it does not account for the many other suituations when you do not know when or where the fight is going to occur. so for this what i propose is simply a common sense resolution. instead of having to petition 24 hours in advance for ccp assistance in making the game work as intended, have automatic node reinforcement using computer data such as pilots in system, ship types, grid load etc. to dynamically judge when it is neccesary for extra relif on the server. note this would only apply to 0.0/lowsec and not high sec as large battles hardly ever occur there.also it should be pointed out, that will not completely solve lag. from what i hear there are other issues server/client side issues that need to be resolved before we can celebrate the lagmonster being defeated.to make this issue work we need some feedback from smart techy minded guys on how viable this proposal is and how it could possibly be accomplished so please if you can add anything relating to it go ahead as i personally am no good in that area.combating the lag monster should absolutely be ccps number 1 priority right now before adding any new content to the game. people are unsubscribing to the game or going inactive because the type of game they want to play is not fun and in a lot of cases not even playable. ccp i ask you to think of all the free pr amd marketing you would get from players waxing lyrical of the fleet combat in eve. right now the only comments you are getting from those people is 'don't play eve!' it must be fixed.i hope this post is a small seed that can grow into something much bigger.go!"
6/20/2010,supporting my own topic :smug:
6/20/2010,"nodes can only be reinforced at downtime. to reinforce it automatically would mean locking all the characters who are in the system, shutting down the node, moving it to a more powerful node, rebooting the system, and hope nobody petitions because the other side was able to log back in first. and then repeat every time that large fleet jumps through a gate.alternatively, the core code could get a rewrite making it multi-thread capable, but to do so would slow down everything else in eve that's not a large fleet fight."
6/20/2010,"from my understanding- though somewhat technically limited- i believe the only chance of eliminating lag would be to code an entirely new client, as well as the server end software that supports the client.i doubt this will ever happenedit to add the obvious- even if you ""eliminated"" lag now- soon more ppl would be involved in standard fights which would reset the bar- and in the end we would still have lag"
6/20/2010,too late....they're already working on it....read the latest hamsterpowered devblog and comments.

6/20/2010,dont you know the blob is there for pve players to make pvp as unenjoyable for pvp players as it is for pve that are forced into pvp to get to better and newer pve content.without this ablitys you would be left with just the hardcore pvp players like yourself i'm guessing but that would end up giving ccp a game they cant afford to keep online.edit: its ccp's basic htfu for everyone. but everyone dislikes it the same and so pvp players stay away from massive blobs of pve players making everything work out right some how.

6/20/2010,itt: radical feminism.
6/20/2010,"hello dograzor, i think you raise an important set of talking points, whatever side of the issue one may come down on. the details of balancing piracy and anti-piracy are complex, and i think the topic deserves its own discussion. it is something i plan to post for discussion in jita park. i hope you'll be happy to discuss it there, where we can give it the full and focused attention it deserves. if you want to start the discussion up in a separate thread, by all means do so. if possible, i would like to side-step the usual trolls, and instead brainstorm ways to make life in low sec better for everyone, pirates and non-pirates alike. i would first like to finish up this issue of professional expectations for the csm. there is still alot of work to do here. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
6/20/2010,"the problem is, of course, that you are a usual troll.you're also a committed liar. as pointed out to you, pirates are already at a severe disadvantage in lowsec (and a massive one in highsec), and yet instead of your real agenda, nerfing pirates, you pretend that you're really interested in ""improving eve for everybody!"" or ""balancing the game between pirates and anti-pirates"" or some such nonsense. if you wanted it balanced, then there'd be a 50% chance that gate guns would fire on outlaws or those with a high sec status, and a 50% chance that concord would gank pirates or their targets, and a 50% chance that pirates wouldn't give out universal kill rights when they're red flashy and instead those with 5.01 sec status would go flashy, and...but you're not honest. you're just looking for a back door method to nerf pirates and trying to distort your intentions dishonestly. you want to find a way to make ""life in lowsec better"". except what you really mean is ""neuter pirates so that people can be ever safer in lowsec"". because you simply don't understand the game of eve, and you want even more places where you can carebear and now lowsec, too, has to be extremely hostile to pirates so that you can run your lvl 5's there, or whatever. you're just part of the church of victim. you've adopted a narrative of powerlessness. it's the mean pirates, it's the mean 0.0 pilots, it's the mean pvpers, it's the mean people who don't like ank. whoever. you're powerless and can't learn to deal with the game with the tools the game already has given you. you need even more protection. and you're prepared to cry about it."
6/20/2010,"oh how i love this. poor ank. props, people of csm!the fact that mynxee got chair is so immensely awesome or ank would be abusing her position to end this dreadful anti-ank-bias."
6/20/2010,"the reason i said ank winning isn't all that bad emerges. threads like this, it has ank showing her natural paranoia along with a decreasing patience threshold of her fellow csm members. also the standard issue fanboi/gurl making blanket statements about sexism and the like which with out a doubt will increase in fervor and tenor as ank continues to think that people having different opinions means that a conspiracy is in action against her. this is going to make some great forum ****."
6/20/2010,let me give you there answer so you dont have to wait for it. ccp: it was a bug to begin with. sorry it just takes us x amount of years to fix are bugs. now htfu.there that should about cover it at least in spirt.

6/21/2010,"i'm glad you like the idea. the plexes themselves do not limit the actual number of ships that can go in. but they do limit the types of hulls that can go in. this can very helpful for breaking up blobs, because if there is a large bs blob you can simply take medium or minor plexes. the side that has fewer pilots can still work toward occupancy by trying to get equal numbers for 1 of 4 different plex sizes. they go something like destroyer/faction frig and down for minors. cruiser and down for medium. bc and down for ?major? and finally open plexes allow anything. so even if you only have 10 active pilots and the other side has 20 you may still be able to put everyone in cruisers and hold a medium plex before the other side can get everyone in cruisers. your ability to coordinate your attacks becomes more important than just blobbing around. this would be an important addition to eve pvp as a whole, as currently every pvp mechanic in eve lacks any real strategic component other than form blob and attack."
6/21/2010,"your suggestion still changes nothing. plex timer = hide and seek. pvpers get bored chasing afk plexing alts and move on to do something else. afk plexing alt returns and caps plex.if one side wants fight - nothing happens. fw is fail! fw is for losers!if both sides want fight - something happens. plexes rule!!!! awesome fights! love all around.there is no substantial figure of merit that can be implemented that will change this.assume one side wants to win occupancy war, or perhaps make some isk off of lps for plexes (another suggested proposal) - not get into fights. if figure of merit is # of kills in plex - never enter plex. pvper bored.if figure of merit is timer - bail, do something else, and return when pvp threat leaves. pvper bored.if figure of merit is killing all npcs - bail, do something else, and return when pvp threat leaves. pvper bored.etc...."

6/21/2010,"+1fixing current things is always a good idea, id be quite happy if ccp kept the 2 releases per year schedule but committed to having at least one of those releases dedicated to improving/fixing/reworking existing content rather than adding new stuff."
6/21/2010,"supported. as a relatively new player, it's more noticeable for me not in the big stuff like faction warfare, but also in the user interface. there are lots of tiny things that could be fixed very quickly and easily to make the game easier to understand and faster to use (for example, letting skills that have prerequisites be placed in the queue after the prerequisite). many new players coming into the game are overwhelmed by the complex interface. while a complex interface is needed for a complex game, much of the interface seems simply over-complicated, and abounds with cryptic icons, tiny text, and unintuitive behavior (the overview settings are a prime example of what's wrong with eve's ui in my opinion). a dedicated ui team could fix many of these issues rather quickly."
6/21/2010,"the ui has been a sticking point with me for the 3 years i've been playing this game. i've never understood why the developers won't just socket the information (my made up term for providing naked information to the client) and let the talented modders in our community develop beautiful ui's for them. (a la wow). why can't i hide all that ****ty solar system text in top left when i'm fighting? and then spring it up, associated with the map when i want to move again? why can't i modify the overview completely, why does it have to be a list, why can't it be tags associated with ships in space, so all the huginns on the battlefield have a nice little huginn label next to them, or whatever.let the community do the work, it'd save you money and you'd probably get a nicer product in the end. come on ccp.ccp controls ui balance issues by controlling what information is provided to the client. to be honest it probably requires an engine rewrite of some sort, but it's probably about time that **** happened anyway.tl,dr: ccp the ui is, and has always been, garbage. fix please."

6/21/2010,"i appreciate your interest in the csm process but nothing is keeping you from writing your own proposal to fix what you think needs fixing. meanwhile, i would like to ask you to stay on-topic, and take the discussion as to what we are supposed to do in your opinion elsewhere. as a pro space councillor you can be sure that i have considered the ups and downs of the proposal and infact already have included this in the first post. had you taken the time to actually read through the topic at-hand, you would be aware of this."
6/21/2010,or just use the existing proposal.
6/21/2010,"yes, steam cloud is an awesome feature, something similar for eve would be perfect and make life so much easier!"
6/21/2010,"i just read your reply too, and i have no idea what ""as a pro space councillor you can be sure that i have considered the ups and downs of the proposal and infact already have included this in the first post. had you taken the time to actually read through the topic at-hand, you would be aware of this."" is even referring to.i read your topic. i read lots of topics. since there's already a topic for the addressbooks issue, yet you think i should create one, it's clear you're not refering to that. and since it's in 8 pages of mostly supports and still nothing from the csm, how many times would you suggest we raise it while csm members just sit around raising.... well... things like this one... increasing network traffic, database access, yes i can see the benefits.... kind of... as in... not really... but anyway, i'd like to end this message on the not even veiled charge that you haven't read anything i put."
6/21/2010,"the voices in my head told me to vote yes. i would, however, like this to be optional. no, it's not paranoia, it's more of a troubleshooting idea. i could upload my local settings, then turn off the upload feature, and muck about with my settings to my heart's content knowing that i can always simply reimport the settings from the server if i screw them up so badly the game becomes unplayable while remaining functional.edit: you could even add a button the login screen, import server side settings."
6/21/2010,"sure, why not?edit - forgot to click the support box :)"
6/21/2010,"yes, it's always the missioner that has the blob as backup and never the ninja salvager... explain why those ""pve players"" gate camp busy low sec systems like amamake or hagilur? surely they would pick a less busy system to operate in when the pvp players could counter-blob? lmfao i've actually found a way to have your quotes actually make more sense (which isn't saying much to begin with). rdy? switch ""pve player"" with ""pvp player"" and vice versa whenever it comes up. try it."
6/21/2010,"good idea, not sure if it's really an incentive for small gang warfare though, but its a good idea. will add more dynamics and fun to the game... which ccp is completely against so it probably wont get passed."
6/21/2010,"supported, this should be what logistic is about, range, not power, atm it's useless :/"
6/21/2010,"yeah, i'd buy a t3 for doing logistics but the bonuses are far far too weak to justify it. medium reps, even bonused, at short range = wtfm8?-liang"
6/21/2010,is there another thrread that discusses this or ....anyway pi takes up way too much tme and not enough reward.this needs to be a bit better balanced.
6/21/2010,i totally agree with everything you pointed out and in such a great detail without a wall of text. thumbs up.
6/21/2010,luckily nobody's forced to do it. o_o
6/21/2010,"true...but i still go for this, it is an interesting idea.it does limit you to only 5 hulks though..."
6/21/2010,and wi lacks titans and jump bridges?
6/21/2010,"for instance, move the ""modify"" and ""cancel"" trade options away from each other. and while you're at it, make it so that the default for canceling trades requires your authorization (""are you sure you want to...?""). there's nothing quite so frustrating as misclicking on ""cancel"" instead of ""modify"" and having your order instantly removed from the market, and then having to pay to relist it. also, for titans the 'jump' and 'bridge to' commands should be moved, for jump bridges 'unanchor' and 'jump'.fix these bits of crappy ui.p.s. suggest more in the thread and i'll update the op."
6/21/2010,"supported in principle, though i can see there being serious practical problems."
6/21/2010,"the player have created the trade hubs, not ccp.so now you want ccp to change the environment that created those trade routes for your convenience?no."
6/21/2010,"ccp has historically intervened with trade hubs pretty frequently. yulai was destroyed with malice aforethought by changes to the gates leading in and out - it was before i was playing, but basically my understanding is that ccp took a meat cleaver to every important route in highsec specifically to make yulai stop breaking their servers. jita took its place, at which point ccp ripped everything of value out of jita - agents, belts, even a stargate. this would hardly be a new thing. besides, it's lowsec. making shorter lowsec routes between hubs is not going to destroy the hubs. frankly, most players won't notice. 90% of the effect of this change will be to destroy people with bad autopilot settings. still, it should happen."
6/21/2010,"yeah, i'm not talking about adding 10 more jumps between every trade hub (except maybe jita->amarr), i'm talking about adding 2-3, and changing gates around to save 1-2 jumps from current by going through a lowsec or three. for jita->dodixie, that would be a 4-6 jump improvement for lowsec over hisec, which is enough for people to actually decide it's worth the risk.one other thing: if the jita->amarr pipe is significantly lengthened (add at least 4 jumps), then we'll need a hisec route from gallente to amarr space, or we'll be looking at 20+ jumps, when most others will only have 15."
6/21/2010,"i agree, the distance between enemy capital systems should be increased, with a low sec/smuggler short cut.the distance between allies should be decreased, even by high-sec.oursulaert <-increased-> jita (and consequently dodixie)oursulaert ->decreased<- hek/rens.jita -> stays same <- domain.oursulaert <-> longish high sec route needed.<-> domain (low sec short cut needed).-- edited in consideration of ihcn comment below --it would probably be best for the high sec link between enemy factions go via the less antagonistic parties. so :-gallente <-> caldari goes via minmatar.amarr <-> minmatar via gallente."
6/21/2010,"to me, it is really irritating that we are unable to post killboard links.i honestly do not understand why they are not allowed. even the crime & punishment subforum states: ""warn others of the latest scam, hire a mercenary to seek revenge or brag about your kills.""so what would unblocking killboard links do?1) posters on caod would actually be able to link the killboard about the battle they are describing.2) you can actually post links to your kills when trying to brag about them on the crime & punishment section.3) stops people getting very irritated when their link is removed. so yeah, thumbs up if you agree with unblocking killboard links in the eve-o forums."
6/21/2010,i'l agree but i think they do this because its never 100% trustworthy
6/21/2010,it is irritating
6/21/2010,no. thumbs-down.your alts are irritating.
6/21/2010,"that. and when he said ""or brag about your kills."" he didn't write exactly"
6/21/2010,i simply had to log in and agree with the suggestions posten here. i have 15 planets with all my accounts and it's not fair that the command centers can't be replaced without killing the colony .. at least there should be an option to re-connect to the structures when placing the new center.
6/21/2010,supported.
6/21/2010,this reminds me of this vid.
6/21/2010,my drunken semi-afk isk backbone!
6/21/2010,supporting this..
6/21/2010,"as a wormhole resident, i was distinctly displeased to discover that pos modules and towers can only be produced in npc stations and nullsec outposts. accordingly, i propose that pos modules and structures be added to either one or more ship assembly arrays or the component assembly arrays.pros: wormhole residents and nullsec corps without the resources for an outpost can participate in planetary interaction fully.cons: uh...not seeing any..."
6/21/2010,"the only problem i can think of is capacity limits on the arrays, but that's actually skirted nicely - capital ship assembly arrays(the biggest pos structure) take 489km3 of mats, and an equipment array holds 500k. it does tie ccp's hands if they ever want to rebalance material reqs, but the current numbers work*. and it does make sense. so yeah, supported. * - for those of you who haven't tried, the fact that the csaa is 850km3 is irrelevant. an array can hold any amount of stuff from delivered jobs, you just have to empty them before it lets you put anything new inside."
6/21/2010,works for me...
6/21/2010,"it is logical, supported."
6/21/2010,"aaargh. drove me nuts the other day when i was trying to find out which assembly array to chuck the materials into. when we found out the answer was 'none of them, sucks to be you,' i was quite stunned. accordingly, supported."
6/21/2010,equipment array? surecsaa in a wormhole? no way in ****.edit: while i do not partake in wormhole stuff i see no reason this shouldn't be brought into the game.
6/21/2010,"just to clarify, he was speaking with regards to the material requirements to produce a csaa in a wormhole, not the ability to anchor a csaa in one."
6/21/2010,"i think it's pretty likely that this will cause a significant amount of lag in major battles, and thus ccp will refuse to do it. however, it's worth asking for, because i could well be wrong."
6/21/2010,i would like this.
6/21/2010,"obvious troll, tq is clearly the test server."
6/21/2010,"so here i was doing worlds collide with my corpies and somebody enters my mission. okay, i know this is allowed, so no problem here. however, he proceeds to loot the quest item. he's already looted my wrecks so he's red to me (i'm not going to shoot him over scrap metal). not only does he steal the item i need to turn in the mission, but he even had the nerve to offer to sell it to us. we petitioned a gm about this and this is allowed even though it's clearly a griefing mechanic.i understand eve is a sandbox, but other players shouldn't be allowed to urinate in it. can we lock cargo containers containing mission items so that only the players owning the mission (or players in their fleet) can loot them? maybe they can be small secure containers so it woulnd't take much new coding to implement."
6/21/2010,10 million isk says a griefer corp decs vagina's corp
6/21/2010,yeah... i do this when i bust someone's mission. incredibly hilarious that he stole your item after already being flashy. i also try to contract the corpses back to people i pod. -liang
6/21/2010,i suggest you quit eve and start playing a game you actually enjoy.
6/21/2010,"it would make for a rather interesting social study to see why i (and so many like me) hate people who concede to a fight before it even begins, people who are scared to death of challenging themselves against other people and why i enjoy so much of doing rotten things to these people.come one science, give us an answer!(btw you are not going to get anywhere with this request)"
6/21/2010,"actually the answer is pretty simple. you don't do it in real life because you actually care about the potential consequences (arrest, imprisonment, lawsuits, etc), but in a pixel world, even eve, there are no permanent consequences (worst case, you just start a new character/account).tl/dr: because you can.also, not supporting the op. if he was already flashy red and you and your group didn't blast the crap out of him, that's your own fault."
6/21/2010,to decline a trap is not conceding a fight it is good strategy. you hate them because they've seen through your transparency and beaten your gambit.i suggest about sacrifice (declined) in chess.
6/21/2010,"tl;dr - refining arrays seem out of scope for the endgame after all these years and haven't been touched ever since introduced. introduce new arrays or rather revise existing ones, taking character skills into account, fit with a reasonable storage capacity and change the way they work to the way reactors work, maybe even with new structures for input/output streaming. they're old, no development, no advancement like other technologies. hell, we even have technology level iii hulls and system available for the general public now. you would think that at least outer ring excavations or some caldari nerd corp (pun intended) would have done some research on this.they're relatively inexpensive, though.they take forver to anchor, online and to unanchor. why?they use up most of your tower's cpu and powergrid.they have a flat yield percentage (35% or 75% for mineral ore, 100% for ice but why?).no skills affect the yield.they can only be anchored in null or low security systems (so pointless) but they will only really be anchored when you have no other means to refine ore and that's in a galaxy far, far away.their capacity is like a humvee with a 10 litres gas tank (or 3 us gallons, i believe), which was plenty though when cars used only like 1 litre on 100 kilometres or mining vessels extracted only 20,000m3 a day.i can keep a medium intensive busy with a mining frigate, that is 20,000m<U+FFFD> every 90 minutes. the big one refines eight times as much in twice the time. that's four frigates.one intensive array cannot even cope with a small gang of three people, don't mention you actually have more than that or it will shut down and refuse to come online because of fear.they can only ever refine one type of item, even if it's an ore subtype (e.g. can refine ""veldspar"" or ""dense veldspar"" but not both at a time).i can see several improvements that could be made and should be considered.introduce a skill that rises the mineral yield, requiring some annoying skill at 5 like anchoring and refinery efficiency, just like starbase defense management.make it work like a reactor instead, using input and output structures. to make this feasible, the cpu requirement would need to be reduced, in my opinion. if both, input and output structure, would require 500tf each like silos do, toning it down from 4,000tf to 3,000tf may be a good call, which makes it on par with the complex reactor array. overall using 4,000tf again.also the input structure would need to hold enough ore to make this actually be useful and an improvement to begin with. the big intensive holds 200,000m<U+FFFD> (for 180 minutes, that's about 1111m<U+FFFD>/min refined), but i would rather target something in the 500k area. reactions can easily run for weeks with less tf and mw.the output structure would need to be able to hold different types of items, i.e. minerals, in which regard the silos are poorly designed imho, since they can only hold one type at a time. pi does a good job here.i could also see this work like the science&industry interface using special structures or even corporate hangar arrays as input and/or output, like you do with copying blueprints. using corporate hangars would make the need of new structures obsolete and provide a satisfying capacity. then you can dedicate one division purely as refining input and remove the ""one type of item only"" barrier.now i don't consider those numbers imbalanced or over the top. control towers lost signifant amounts of importance and only remain as invaluable tools in deep space and prerequisite for supercapital production.where you are really dependent on a control tower, it's most likely an untertakement of a corporation and not a solo project. three people can easily mine 200,000m<U+FFFD> in half an hour or less and that's already 180 minutes worth of refining time. 900 minutes even in a medium intensive!share your thoughts :)"
6/21/2010,"hello fellow players,one thing i have noticed about the npe (new player experience) is that you need the industry skill to start manufacturing (for two of the story arcs), yet they don't give it to you nor the skillbook. i propose that all new players should start with this skill at level 1, in much the same way as the mining skill is done. this would make the whole npe a lot less of a headache.- buny"
6/21/2010,i suggest they drop the learning skills and go back to a character creation that actually meant something besides a pretty picture.
6/21/2010,"drop learning but character should matter, except picture."
6/21/2010,"newbies should be able to complete the tutorial without reference to things outside of the tutorial. whether that means putting a skill book drop into the tutorial, putting a ""go to the market and buy the skill book"" segment into the tutorial, or just creating characters with the skill, i don't care. i suggest that you're goddamned crazy. the old system, of putting the most important decision you'll ever make into the hands of the least knowledgeable folks in eve, was madness. and learning skills are fine if you don't go all ocd about them."
6/21/2010,ok
6/21/2010,"learning skills dont add anything, are stupid and should be removed.character creation shouldnt matter, only favours alts if it does matter, since rookies cant know what is handy to have.that is best solution since rookies often dont know how to get skill books, would immediatly fix that."
6/21/2010,"i guess i should clarify. i'm not talking about attribute gains those should remain as they are now, with the remapping, that was a really good move on ccp's part. and i'm not even specifically talking about 800 k sp worth of skills either (although i liked that better then the double speed). but as it stands now choosing this or that is entirely pointless except for the portrait. it takes away a huge part of the game for many people (for instance i am often perfectly happy playing around with character generators for hours simply because it's fun). perhaps ""takes"" isn't the right word, but it leaves an area of the game that could be huge undeveloped and sad.i'm not sure why they are unwilling to bonus actual game-play assuming they spent the time to balance it(a far-fetched assumption i know). then choosing the various careers and race would have actual impact. nothing large, stuff like 2% more structure here, 2% more speed there, or 2% faster research times for industry chars. stuff like that maybe. maybe not, but i just kind of want to have character creation mean something (not the attributes though that was ****ing stupid).that said it's probably something they'll have to go into with incarna and i'm perfectly happy to wait and see what happens."
6/21/2010,"i agree, free industry for everybody!"
6/21/2010,"i'm not talking about options during character creation or learning skills, but just this proposal. if you don't like my proposal, be sure to tell me so. however, don't derail this proposal with other unassociated ideas.and, as always, be sure to check the support option if you agree with it - buny"
6/21/2010,fair enough.
6/21/2010,"even for a newbie this is a very good skill to have at least to level 1. its also a x1 time multiplier. this one is very quick to learn...not that long either. besides, its a requirement for production efficiency which in my opinion even a pvp'er should get. everyone knows that producing is cheaper and even a pvp'er should/could produce ammo. pvp'er use a lot.quit being lazy and train it.not supported"
6/21/2010,"the point, flying above ----> 333>-> \0/ <---- you. llll / \"
6/21/2010,agreed for obvious reasons.
6/21/2010,i disagree with all of this. yes lets take away the learning skills and let those who spend millions of sp in them and months of game time just be out of luck so they quit the game. lets also give new players a skill they can get day one anyway. this is whole thread is basicly asking for a new system that gives the players asking for it the long side of the stick. many players get screwed when they switched to the remap system just to help the newest of players. i for one ended up throwing a toon that was about 1 1/2 months old with all level 5 implants right in the trash. as it was a max learning toon and with new players getting a remap i was able to start over and pass up my orginal max sp toon. ((purely due to second remap for all new toons)) thanks ccp you really helped me throw a good $60 in the trash.now we got people wanting to get rid of a system that people have invest in. they spent the time to work on long term goals instead of short term goals. now that the are seeing the pay off of the patiance lets take the reward away. who cares if they already got stuck in only a destroyer for 6 months.the current system already gives new players far more sp then it use to before remaps and that makes the % gap smaller then ever. plus a 2x multiplier that can be used on the learning skills right off the bat makes that gap even bigger. just leave it alone and stop the crying over nothing.if you want to do industry just train day 1 and get your industrial ship. just like mission/pvp people do for thier destroyers. also the industrial ships are given out just like the destroyers if you do the tutorial agents.
6/21/2010,you fail at reading comprehension like no person i have ever seen before.
6/21/2010,i think your original premise (that he read any of the previous posts) may be flawed.support for having it be added a tutorial unto itself (buying the skill book). i can't tell you how many times i have seen that question in the help channel.
6/21/2010,support the principle. i think it would be better to give the skillbook as the reward for a previous mission in the industry tutorial rather as a free start skill.
6/21/2010,"i feel so much intelligence in your argument...its killing me.seriously, come on ????? why, please explain your awesome funniness. soooooo 30 minutes max is a too much workload for you ????? wow."
6/21/2010,lee bump-age... musn't let this sit idly... lets get csm support on this please.
6/21/2010,stop bumping.
6/21/2010,this makes perfect sense to me.
6/21/2010,it does sound dodgy.
6/21/2010,invisible aggro timer needs to go.
6/21/2010,supported
6/21/2010,how about also opening up the in-game chat channels to irc?
6/21/2010,"no to the chat channels, but yes to the forwarding of ingame mail.i know it would be easier to send and receive the ingame mail if, for example, i could access the game's mail system on my cell phone in something other than the cumbersome evegate site (cumbersome on a mobile device, at least)."
6/21/2010,"ccp has already responded with a rather simple ""no"" to this idea"
6/21/2010,"then we'd see nothing but stealth bomber blobs. replacing af/cruiser blobs with bomber blobs isn't a good trade. however, if you insist, firing a bomb should result in instant gcc, it need not even explode. sentry guns should also wtfbbq any bombs within their range before detonation. it might be kinda sorta balanced then."
6/21/2010,"yes i know how they work. thats the point, with this change i think its fair to say that bombs should need a target to shoot(you need to lock them i mean). that way you would get the warning. when you get that warning, gate guns can insta lock..which means no more cloak. that should give the fair advantage for people to target the sb and shoot it...or just try to kill it...well a chance to get destroyed"
6/21/2010,how about no.
6/21/2010,"lowsec is unique in the part where you need a heavier ship which can get tackled normally without bubbles/etc to do anything under sentries.hint hint. if you make it so you can kill stuff on gates with small very slippery ships, then you need to add bubbles to balance it out, and then you've just made lowsec into a worse version of npc 0.0."
6/21/2010,"i see no problems with bombs in low sec. they take up a large amount of cargo space (2 or 3 bombs in a single bomber), are more expensive than most ammunition and bombers will not be able to stand up to sentry gun aggro. theres no bubbles allowed in low sec to keep ships in place so theres a chance that fast ships can warp off.if smartbomb battleships can be used next to gates why not bombs?"
6/21/2010,because you can catch the smartbomb bs and it can do next to nothing vs ships that are bigger than frigs or haulers.
6/21/2010,pretty much at this point.
6/21/2010,"there's four combat recons. two(curse, rook) are effective and commonly used - they combine strong ew with a capable method of dealing dps. two are crap, because they're basically the same as the force recon, but without the covops cloak. i'd like to see the huginn and lachesis be as good as the curse and the rook. five weapons with 1-2 bonuses seems fairly reasonable. i'd probably give the lach 5 launchers and a missile damage (or thermal damage, if you want to perpetuate that rather odd system) bonus in place of the hybrid bonus, and then i'd give the huginn 5 turrets and +5% web strength in place of the missile bonus. gives the gallente another non-terrible missile ship on top of just the bomber(and then boost the eris similarly, to make it 3 total), and turns two of the least-used t2 cruisers into popular, capable ships. it also makes the force/combat line nice and bright - force recons do cloaky stuff and bad damage, combat recons are significantly more powerful ships in toe-to-toe fights, but with no subtlety potential."
6/21/2010,"first, the lach is not useless. used properly it is in fact an absolutely brutal ship, and in my opinion a vital component to hac gangs. the huginn, on the other hand, seems pretty sad.here's the problem with giving the lach five launchers: smart pilots don't fit sensor damps on their lachesis. they fit a disruptor, a scrambler, and an mwd. the remainder of their mid and rig slots go to a shield tank, giving you 44k ehp minimum. with 40 m3 of drones and five bonused launchers, the lach will out-dps the rook, have a shield tank better than that of most hacs, be able to shut off mwds at 18+km and be able to warp disrupt at 60km. maybe this is balanced compared to the rook, but i frankly think it'd be overpowered."
6/21/2010,"i never said the lach is useless - i own one, and i fly it occasionally. thing is, the only times i fly it are times when i'm trying to save money compared to an arazu. it's 30 mil or so cheaper, because the bpos produce enough to supply demand, unlike with arazus where more expensive invention is required to feed the higher demand. compare that to a rook or a curse - you don't save money with those. in fact the curse is reliably more valuable than the pilgrim. that's because there's demand for them in their own right, not just as cheaper versions of other, better ships. i want the other two combat recons to be in the same place. and yes, there's a chance that my lach numbers are too strong. i mean them as a basis of discussion, not as a ""this is balanced, you can implement it tomorrow"" change. but they don't seem crazy. sure, it has more ehp than a rook, but its ew is going to be a lot weaker. still, that's something that can be figured out in balancing - use my numbers, or ones like them, as a first draft, and go from there."
6/21/2010,"i petitioned this once, so as a gallentean missile user this gets my automatic support."
6/21/2010,"actually the typical reason i've seen a lach used (or at least the reason i use it) is that it is considerably more survivable in a hi/lowsec environment than an arazu. that extra midslot really makes a huge difference in terms of tanking ability and general flexibility. i am therefore much more comfortable putting pimp faction points on it. i would suggest that giving the huginn an extra mid would go a long way towards balancing it, as well. still, split weapons systems are generally a pain, so i wouldn't be opposed to perhaps giving the lach a boost in that regard."
6/21/2010,"why not use the 'planets' tab under science and industry, you can double click on any of your planets to jump straight to planet view.totally agree on the second part - supported!"
6/21/2010,"automated rescanning will never happen - look at the design of this system. it's pure effort = reward. the guy in a mental institution for ocd gets to mine 3x as much as you because he runs 30-minute timers 23/7, and the sane person has to make do with 23h timers. if it auto-repeated, they'd never need anything but 30m timers. now personally, i wish it worked more like moon mining(surely the first time that phrase has ever been uttered), but it doesn't and it won't. don't bother hoping for it."
6/21/2010,"i'm aware of that it is possible to quite easy switch from planet to planet view by using industry tabs, but it would be easier to just switch without leaving the current planet, going to industry tab and choosing next planet. that's why i called it an improvement, nothing big. :)auto-repeated extraction process is imo not a good idea. why? there would be no point in different deposit ranges, if you can have so much minerals extracted with 5min cycle and make it auto-repeat why anyone would ever use the 30min cycle?and to be more specific on my second idea... because i suck at english grammar... it could be similar to multi-unit production in incoming starcraft 2, where you can select few same buildings, click unit production and all selected buildings will start to produce chosen unit.so i think it would be pretty cool if you could just shift-select multiple extractors of same type and choose extraction cycle for selected extractors then."
6/21/2010,"eve-search.com is your friend, use it.there are over a dozen pi threads in the assembly hall already, not counting the numerous spam posts on the general forum, industry, and others.support existing threads, they already cover 100% of your complaints."
6/21/2010,only a portion of the problem is in the software. it won't matter if the frontend coding is spotless if the backend can't handle the connections and database calls needed to handle shoving 1000+ players into one system
6/21/2010,best thread in folder.
6/22/2010,"no there would be no more hide and seek plexing. every time you entered a plex your presence will be announced to everyone in all the militias. there would be a separate channel (maybe 2 -1 for each front) like the current militia channel but it would only give broadcasts. if i entered a minor plex in ammamake in my merlin it would broadcast something like:""ammamake; minor amarr:cearain frigate""*everyone* in fw would get this message. you can call entering a plex whatever you want but it wont be hiding. it will be the opposite. it will be announcing where you are for the next 10-20 minutes if anyone wants to come fight.in the scenario above once you chase the first guy off you can close the plex. all the while you will be announcing where *you* are for the next few minutes. so if you are looking for good pvp that will be the way to do it. if no one wants to pvp then maybe no one will come. but i think thats unlikely. if this announcement mechanic is implemented you will get company if you enter a plex. this will make fw the best small gang pvp in eve."
6/22/2010,this would be very nice to see. ++ for csm participants bringing this idea forward to the attention of ccp.
6/22/2010,"supported, but not for any lengthened expansion schedule. to hell with expansion ""schedules"" entirely. new features should be decided on and they should be released when they're ready, period. if it takes two years to institute a cool change, then it takes two years. like blizzard always says, it'll be ready when it's ready. and in the meantime, fix what dominion broke."

6/22/2010,"already supported, but the more i think about this the more important it seems.this needs to be something that really does start to change the culture of the whole of ccp. months after they broke the pirate epic arcs the gms are implying that it might be worth people hanging around these systems when there is no evidence ccp are even trying to fix these.it is also even more ridiculous considering they spawn heavily demanded items that were being balanced by the greater supply the pirate arcs created.obviously we can forget ever seeing any more pirate arcs as well despite promises they would be out soon.when people in ccp promise to do something they should be held accountable whenever they do not, since currently any player over 6 months knows nothing ccp say can be trusted which completely destroys ccp's ability to communicate meaningfully with their players.the crazy thing is most people showing their support in this thread care deeply about the game, but are made to feel that their loyalty is going to be abused rather than rewarded."
6/22/2010,supported.
6/22/2010,"hell, even a release schedule of once a year would be enough if it means much higher quality with more features, and more post-launch support.also, this a hundred times."
6/22/2010,"don't be a fool into thinking this will ever happen. that is not an expansion. also if there is no new content, then there is no new subscripers (those who have never played eve before).my question is this:is it too much to ask for both?that is content and fixes."
6/22/2010,bumping this thread to first page.
6/22/2010,"posting in a thread full of people refusing to use anything else but blasters and cn antimatter on their ships.majority of blaster setups i know put out more dps than their ac/pulse counterparts and considering that you need to think about whole picture with warp scramblers/webs, ability to field drones and optimal etc.in fleet again you're supposed to fit railguns in your hybrid ships. blasters are like... are you like... mentally challenged? even with railguns gallente ships are generally better choice over caldari equivalents.it's not excuse to boost all guns if some certain ships (like deimos maybe) could use some kind of role oomph. even deimos is decent ship but ishtar able to field battleship class weapon systems in hac hull is just too lucrative over deimos.but alright it's irc post. just noticed. :p"

6/22/2010,signed! sounds like a great idea
6/22/2010,"supported. they don't add anything to the game but an extra slog and i know they put off new players. especially when you get idiots telling them to buy the game and do nothing but sit in a station and train learning skills for the first couple weeks (although to be fair, that's more the idiots' fault than the learning skills, but still...)"
6/22/2010,seems like a reasonable way to remove a pointless mechanic
6/22/2010,"to be honest, when i was a new player i had no issue with learning skills what so ever. i did not know anyone playing the game and i didn't compare myself to others. i thought the decision process between training a learning skill to the next level, or something that would benefit me immediately, was pretty interesting. i cherish the first month in the game. i thought it was great to explore the game in my own pace whether it i was ratting in low sec with a tristan or mining omber in a navitas. i don't think the game gets more fun just because i can fly fancier stuff or make more isk/hour. to me it is all about setting up a goal and pursue that goal. its the journey there that's fun (sound cliche, i know but its true).if a new player have friends who are prancing around with gigatrillions of isk and an attitude of lul, im making 2b isk/hour doing this and that in my superduper pwnmobile and this is what you have to do to become as awesome as i am, of course new players will feel inadequate.if your approach is that its all about getting the largest epeen in shortest possible time and you are constantly comparing yourself to those that have played the game for several years, then i can see why learning skills is a problem./rant"
6/22/2010,yes!
6/22/2010,then remove the attributes that the learning skills enhance too! not supported
6/22/2010,"i seriously disagree with changing the learning skills.learning skills are an option, not a requirement. you can train anything, fly anything, and do anything in eve without them. unlike, say spaceship command.learning skills are an option. they are not required.yes, they provide an advantage to players who choose to train them. so what? using a 10km warp scrambler provides an advantage to a player who tries to tackle someone who's fit a warp core stabilizer. none of those things are required to play the game.regardless of whether ccp actually wants to get rid of them (and i don't think they should do anything, it's not broken), this proposal is not worthy of anyone's time in the csm or at ccp.removing/changing the learning skills is yet another example of modern society being so self-centered they feel that they should be entitled to something because someone else has it.however, if ccp actually is going to do something about learning skills, then they should just remove them and the bonuses they provide. period. then it can take even longer for everyone to train anything. that will make the game a whole lot more fun, don't you think?"
6/22/2010,i do not agree with removing them.they are not a required skill.all the time i spent 'learning' learning skills... what happens to that.will i be re-imbursed for the monthly subscription fee? -nothey are not a requirement - dont add more - dont get rid of any.if you chose not to skill them up - so you learn slower - big deal.if you chose to skill them up - you are not skilling up in something else so maybe one day you can skill up faster.i do not support this change.
6/22/2010,"yes support the idea, lets stop talking bout it and do it already"
6/22/2010,why is there so much bitterness in this thread? the idea is simply to allow you to reallocate the sp you put into learning elsewhere.
6/22/2010,"why should you reallocate the sp? if you trained the skills you got the benefit of having them. period, end of sentence. if you didn't train them you didn't. when you have already had the benefit of the skill, why do you deserve additional benefits?"
6/22/2010,"because gewrixlera, you spent a month learning guns, while i spent a month learning logic.at the end of the month if they just take it away - i have nothing and you have guns. that is why i say leave them be - dont add more, skill em up if u want or dont. stop complaining about them taking a long time to skill up. if you dont like it - then dont skill them."
6/22/2010,learning skills were never a good idea.
6/22/2010,"most definitely supported. i'm well on my way to finishing the learning grind (to 5/4 at least), and it's been a trying experience to put it lightly. i'd much rather see new players (and accounts) training at full speed (excluding implant variables) from the start than have them work learning (and thus, months of essentially non-progressed idle time which puts off actual gameplay skills).really hope this topic gets some attention. it is very much worth changing for the continued growth and retention of the player base."
6/22/2010,excellent idea. ccp already has the tech in place to give increased lp gain.
6/22/2010,"i remember we had this feature before. when i lost my drones once because i warped out and forgot my drones i could see them in another tab in my drone window...anyway, its supported."
6/22/2010,this
6/22/2010,i want them drones back please
6/22/2010,supported losing drones to a dc is very irratating to say the least.
6/22/2010,"to correct reconnect rangesupported - with conditions.1. the option is available if the player warps away from the drones for any reason. player must be within drone control range to reconnect.2. during the reconnect term, drones are still considered active, thus more drones cannot be deployed unless the active drones are recovered to cargo/dronebay or abandoned. current ship must have drone bandwidth to connect to drones, or number of reconnected drones limited to available bandwidth.3. due to signal decay, the drones are effectively ""abandoned"" if they are not recovered within 15 minutes (use standard aggro timer).4. jumping systems or docking automatically abandons the drones.5. it is not possible to reconnect to abandoned drones. abandoned drones can be scooped to cargo or drone bay as per current methods still. in addition, abandoned drones can be collected by any player that encounters them. disconnected drones cannot be scooped to cargo by a different player until abandoned.6. npcs should continue to shoot drones - disconnects suck but your drones are still shooting them, so response should be expected.7. it would be nice to be able to warp to drones (like warp to fleet member) although this introduces interesting tactical implications of disconnected drones."
6/22/2010,i like this. you don't abandon your fighters if your a carrier that dc's. they will actually warp to your ewarp point and board with your carrier half the time. it took me a couple of times when i thought one or two died to find it was back in my drone bay taking a nap.to the poster above me. i think what would be better and what ccp would do is have you be able to reconnect inside drone range. being able to send out 45 km with my rokh but able to reconnect and recall at 150 seems a bit broken
6/22/2010,yes - you are correct - i will edit to correct that.
6/22/2010,"what bugs me especially about this is that i have a really fast lan connection but for some reason it'll blink off line an average of 1-2 times per 2 hours of play time. now this is okay for games like fps's, a little lag spike and thats all. for this game it makes the whole program close and it is beyond frustating. 3.5 mil of drones is the price tag. thats not a lot of money for me but its the process of getting back in the seat that irritates me. this should have been fixed a long time ago. i'll throw a couple of ideas that i haven't thought of yet into the fire.two more modes for drone settings:swarm: upon disconnection with operator, drone will continue to attack targets. stealth: upon disconnection with operator, drone will shutdown and go into cloak. (drone will uncloak after and set amount of time, lets say 2 hours. after which, drone will start standard decay. original operator will be able to see cloaked drones whereabouts upon warping back in)"

6/22/2010,"currently we have 3 major powerblocs in 0.0, nc, sc and dcnow vs 20072005 -> 2007 -> 2010, i dont have anything on the sovereignty from 2005 but it made 2007 look bad, in 5 years 0.0 has turned into blobby naps.nc control all the north, sc control all the south and dc control the drone regions, sometimes referred to as the russians, theres some independent alliances / powerblocs however they have a strong connection / standing to major alliances within the nc / sc so dont really get classed as independent.this wasnt what 0.0 was like several years ago, these powerblocs if anything have increased to the point where life in 0.0 has been reduced to generic warfare (south vs north) / macro ratting / plexing / roaming.there simply isnt enough conflict and despite the changes made through dominion smaller alliances dont have a chance in 0.0 without branding themselves as pets.naps were made during the time when everyone was raging and wanted everyone else dead for reasons people cant remember, i remember a time when razor were neutral to rawr and when pl / daisho fought over fountain.stuff like this doesnt happen anymore simply because you arent attacking one alliance you are attacking all its pets, its allies and its allies pets until eventually having 3000 in local is classed as skill and the only strategy is node crashing and super cap hotdrops.looking at events over the past 5 years i have noticed ego and fear play a very important role in these naps.i personally dont have a major solution in fixing this but i would strongly advise ccp / csm to have this as one of the major things to be looked at, i understand certain csm are in 0.0 alliances and would hate to remove blob warfare but i am certain with a reduction in naps and increase in war 0.0 will become fun again and not limited to nap trains and roams.tldr  0.0 is split into 3 power blocs and isnt fun, fix it"
6/22/2010,cool story bro
6/22/2010,"emergent behaviour is emergent. you dont have to like it, but if forming powerblocks is what people in 0.0 want to do, who are you to say that ccp should step in and tell people that they're building the wrong kind of sandcastles?the players have built their empires in player sovereignty 0.0? that's what it's there for. the nature of the space dictates the politics. sov space is for mighty empires clashing with huge fleets.if you want rapidly changing, splintered, small-gang paradise space, that's what npc 0.0 is for. by all means ask ccp for more of that; i'll support you every step of the way. or ask for more space like w-space. or more space which is a combination of both... a thousand or so systems with probable abandoned mini-stations that can be captured by a few dozen battleships, only a few permanent gates that wont admit any hull bigger than a battlecruiser, and lots of wormholes. add good rats, poor static resources (no moons or agents), delayed local and so forth, plus some local unobtanium that makes the place worth visiting, and you have the perfect recipe for space dominated by small, fast-moving gangs.but your op is no different from missionbears who whine to make missions instanced because they dont like the way other people play. sandbox. get over it."
6/22/2010,"nice spin but lets be real over the past few years independent wars have stopped, it is simply sc vs nc vs pl & co and has stopped at this, no other types of wars happen.now that 0.0 is calm it is knwon that activity in 0.0 is limited to roams / macro ratting, correct me if im wrong but wasnt the whole max mk ii war to end powerblocs for good?i know this is a sandbox, i get that but look at what its become, any alliance that wishes to invade now another has no chance as you will get 30k within different alliances joining to help in. at first it will be fun and play but once a side is losing it will bring more people until it is eventually battle of the blobs, a node crash being the third party.everything within 40 jumps blue vs independent pvp / activity within 0.0you sure you picked the right type of gameplay?"
6/22/2010,"i agree that player null is quite boring, but also agree with reply 1: players made it like this and this is (apparently) how most of they want to have it. i think the simple solution is expanding npc stations via some kind of npc faction offensive. npc null is a lot of fun for small gangs and even a lot of solo pilots (i've been solo exploring, ratting, and ganking for about a year myself, so i do consider my opinion biased) and i would like to see a larger number of freeports out there for those who don't want to engage in the politics and grind of the current nap regimes."
6/22/2010,"theres several csms that were focusing on ending nap / blob warfare, forgot who they were but i would actually like to see them showing some ideas on how to achieve this"
6/22/2010,no. this is your thread. come up with an actual idea instead of just whining about things. i don't see why others would have to do the work for you.
6/22/2010,"so, you don't like it that alliances are shaping their borders through politics and diplomacy, which are very valid game tactics."
6/22/2010,politics / diplomacy is all fine but when you have 0.0 split in 3 sections its a joke i made this perfectly clear in my initial post :p
6/22/2010,"up the costs of owning space considerably; have it increase exponentially after a certain number of systems are controlled. to compensate, up the benefits and number of pilots each system can support considerably. 0.0 plexing should be considerably more profitable than l4 missioning--i think a minimum of twice as good. that would encourage alliances to hold less territory (which i believe was one of the points of tyrannis) and should help break up the power blocs somewhat."
6/22/2010,"you should totally send your suggestion to your local member of parliament/senate/whatever, how dare they want to live in peace instead of constant warfare! i think you need to face it, 0.0 is all about player control (politics). if you want to avoid it, you need to stick to empire, 0.0 pirate controlled space, or wormholes."
6/22/2010,i keep forgetting eve is rl
6/22/2010,"if you remove peoples abilities to nap via game mechanics they will just do it in the meta anyways. you cannot stop people from banding together. it's in our nature. it's part of the reason mmo's are so popular. if you don't like it, find a way to fight it."
6/22/2010,"ok so say i invaded nc or w/e goons hold now whats to guarantee i wont get 30k players blobbing my arse.this isnt about stopping naps its about making their size smaller to the point where powerbloc numbers arent ******edly higher than the average players onlineif an alliance keen on 0.0 decides to invade any 0.0 space, by default it will get mass blobbed over and over by the enemy, doesnt seem like diplomacy is the issue here but freedom to nap everything within 40 jumps.i strongly feel the mechanics and current situation get looked at, theres alot of low sec / empire alliances that are keen on 0.0 but whats the point since its either being branded pets or fighting at 1:300 odds :p"
6/22/2010,"if you invaded somebody else's space then yeah, expect a retaliation, and if they have lots of friends expect that retaliation to be large in numbers. there is however a lot of claimable 0.0 space that remains unclaimed. if you're small enough to not be noticed or warrant destroying (think bespin), then you might be able to make a foothold.there are plenty of examples of alliances holding space near unfriendly power blocs. there are also many different ways to solve any single problem, and the sandbox allows (even requires) you to use your brain a bit to solve them. if it's really what you want, come up with an idea of how to take 0.0 sov and give it a go. if it doesn't work, maybe it's your solution to the problem that's at fault and needs modification, rather than the natural conditions that exist."
6/22/2010,"i got some ideas while reading this but they will probably need some more thinking over-make tcu's and ih's require fuel just like pos towers part of it ice and the other part form planets (planet mining would need some work before that tough) it would make it harder to manage big clusters of systems (yes i know that would cause more server load and more lagg too probably ~,~)-add another 2000 or so 0.0 sectors some of them could be small islands with only a few connections to other 0.0 right now we already have a some islands like that and they are mostly occupied by smaller alliances -make systems deplete so alliances have to move around to get new resources and ppl need to fight about resource rich space"
6/22/2010,"people defending their homes and working together to do so in an mmo?! oh no we must change the game so they cannot do thisseriously if you want to take space you need to work towards it, this isn't wow where you can just walk into a zone and declare an inn your bind spot. if you encroach on space people own and fight to keep you should expect to find them defending it from you. your scream of blobbing is just a complaint of players working together in a game that was created so people could work together. maybe the problem is you and your methods?"
6/22/2010,well the problem is that the only way to counter people working together you need to bring more people so circle ends. you are very well aware of that but your just a carebear scared of a little of competition.
6/22/2010,if you don nap you die. its that simple.you turn table around. its not people doing naps becuase they want to. they do it becuase they have to.
6/22/2010,you do realize that if ccp puts in a mechanic to allow smaller numbers to counter large numbers people will just form meta alliances that arent enforced in game and come in many smaller groups so they still retain the advantage right? if you think the smaller group of people working together should triumph over the larger maybe you should try to find something out of the box to accomplish this like people have in eve's past?op: do you realize the 2007 map you provided has one alliance and their allies controlling 2/3rds of the map while the other third is a group of 3-4 blocs right?

6/22/2010,nice idea!i believe when you need a deep mining op 5 hulks is not enough.jump bridge for industrial ships will be great.
6/22/2010,rorqual already has a 'ghetto' jump bridge capability. not really supported. there are ways and means to use it's capabilities above and beyond it's original purpose.
6/22/2010,"they can use gates, jump bridges and and titan bridges. what more do you want? you can clone jump to the rorqual, then board a hulk from the rorqual."
6/22/2010,"why do we have 6 different command centres? why not just have the elite command centre with the maximum amount of power grid and cpu that a person can have? the basic costs 100,000 and the elite costs about 6 million more which in eve someone can get easily.really in terms of pi all we need is the basic command centre for people without skills and the elite command centre for those that do. is this really ccp making things more complicated than they need to be? havn't they heard of kiss (keep it simple stupid)?"
6/22/2010,"i propose an automatic scanning feature on the directional scanner. check an 'autoscan' box, click scan and it will refresh the scanner every 1.2 seconds, or whatever the cool down timer is now. it could also have a longer cool down (say 2 seconds instead of 1.2) on autoscan to handicap it a bit. also a max autoscan time could be attached to it of 1-5 minutes to avoid abuse. anything would be a big improvement over repetitiously clicking scan while trying not to do it so fast that the horrid 'scanner is recalibrating' message comes up in the middle of my screen (and stays there for 3 scan cycles).also, this could be a very valuable tool if we can ever get local nerfed (please!!!)"
6/22/2010,supporting my own super awesome idea.
6/22/2010,this is a terrible idea that probably only will be supported by carebears.
6/22/2010,god no. this would only help macroers.
6/22/2010,leave it to the biggest carebears to propose something like this
6/22/2010,"because macro'ers would really benefit from not having to smash a button every 2 seconds, since it would be impossible to add that to a macro (that is sarcasm).still would probably kill the server, everyone having it on auto refresh, dir scan needs complete overhaul combined with removal of local."
6/22/2010,ccp has specifically stated that this won't happen.
6/22/2010,and i will specifically state that something will have to happen to the scanner.maybe ccp should finally iterate on some of their designs..
6/22/2010,completely agree. ccp stated that this won't happen to the current scanner. so the current scanner needs to be changed.and local needs to be changed to delayed.
6/22/2010,"it's not about the current scanner. it's about doing distance checks between you and every object in the solar system, every time you re-scan. it apparently causes significant lag, and i don't see any good way of eliminating that problem. hence, won't happen. sucks to be you."
6/22/2010,"t3 was sold to the populace as a modular ship with you able to pick and choose what subsystems you wanted for maximum effect. however, despite their uses in some situations they have turned out to be a bit of a damp squib. each race only has a couple of really viable combinations. at the end of the day you know that when you face a proteus it will be equipped with blasters and be hardened against kinetic/thermal, you know that if you're fighting a tengu he's going to have a shield tank.suggestion:allow a t3 hull to be equipped with any racial subsystem as long as the skills are present.imagine it. laser tengus, heavy missile spamming neuting proteus', a loki vulnerable to gallente jammers. real unpredictability when you are fighting these vessels.perhaps certain racial characteristics should be imbibed within the hulls (ie racial resists and sensor strength) to not throw things too much off balance.reference cosmetics, every sub has a racial counterpart so it's simply a case of using the same model for the three other races when applied to the ship (ie, a loki would look the same with whatever race's command module fitted).in order to ofset the benefits perhaps bigger penalties are required if using an off racial module, perhaps the loss of two levels of a skill if it is the randomly determined one for the chop."
6/22/2010,"i like the idea and i hoped that t3 would be like that but i wouldn't want to chance t3 that way anymore rather use that idea for a t4 ship, only one hull and loads of subsystems for all races which even can change the class of the ship from bc to bs and so on"
6/22/2010,"i honestly can't believe i am going to do this.i support the idea, if not lark's actual implementation. this would make t3 ships even more unpredictable than they are/should be now. it would offer small roaming gangs the chance to really surprise opponents with unusual arrangements, something that is sadly lacking at present.i would (rather than monkeying with the skills loss) apply less of a bonus if mounting the module to a non-racially matching hull (say by 25 or 50 percent). this would also allow for an additional high rank skill that would lessen those penalties by say 2% per level (call it subsystem compatibiilty or something).supporting the theory at any rate."
6/22/2010,im not really knowledgeable about t3 but let me throw this concern out.this change just seems to make calling primary a complete crap shoot. you go up against 10 t3 ships. just primary the closest? to the extent t3 becomes more and more widespread this seems to mitigate any advantages you have of being knowledgeable about how ships can be fit. i would be concerned that this would make them *too* unpredictable. if you have no way to predict what the ships have on them you have no way to strategize.
6/22/2010,hilarious idea
6/22/2010,"yeah, i hear that a lot i like the idea of a cut to efficiency. the devil is in the details and the actual penalty would be up to people with far more knowledge than me to decide.with regards to increasing the unpredictability surely that's the point. t3s tricked out for a role are (in most cases) sub par to their t2 counterparts and considering the investment that is put into them in terms of isk and risk i think it's a p cool and balanced idea.and in the scenario suggested whereby you come across a group of t3 ships, well, it might foster a bit more on the fly tactical thinking and communication within your gang. keep in mind you will still be able to view the nature of the subsystems fitted and if racial resists are decoupled from subs and applied to hulls you'll still know what damage types to apply and which jammers to use. do you know immeadiately who to primary first if you encounter a group entirely consisting of (lol) legions?"
6/22/2010,"balancing this will be evil, but if it can be done it would be a fantastic idea."
6/22/2010,"i like the idea, it would be fun to see t3 being what they really are supposed to be: ""fully costumizable"" ships."
6/22/2010,"omfg, actually logged into these ****ty forums to support this awesome idea.edit: i forgot to support it lolllool"
6/22/2010,as long as racial cruiser 5 becomes prereq for the subs as well.
6/22/2010,fantastic idea...somebody gief me iskies for a t3 to proof op's point!
6/22/2010,"the details of implementing this would be utter murder. not just game design, either - i'm pretty sure the art department will make firebombing your house a group excursion if they're asked to make this work. but the idea is cool, and i'd like to see what can be done with it."
6/22/2010,"as i suggested there shouldn't really need to be a change to artwork, maybe adding a turret hardpoint here or there. perhaps a slightly different colour scheme for fitting an off race sub? no real need for frakenstein like monstrosities."
6/22/2010,very nice idea. wtb lazooooor loki
6/22/2010,lasers? on a tengu? blasphemy! but also a cool idea.support.
6/22/2010,+1 legion + the tengu missile subsystem = rock the road.
6/22/2010,bad idea.if you want to fly different ships then train for them just like for all other ships.you might as well introduce a 'hide the type of ship i fly' cloak for all hacs/recons.i like if if a hull has 2 or 3 reasonable fittings but this would make them all too similar.
6/22/2010,"the problem is, there's no single t3 hull design. you could try to equate them, and say that an legion defensive resist module on a tengu looks like a tengu's resist module, but gold. but frankly, that would look ugly as sin, so i don't see it happening. you'd need huge amounts of art work or to dramatically lower your standards, neither of which i expect to appeal. like i said, i like the idea. but i don't think ccp will think it worthwhile."
6/22/2010,"ohh a laser tengu, or a maybe a blaster loki.i would love to see this."
6/22/2010,"i definitely agree with the premise, but jita->amarr doesn't need to be decreased. if we're going with your plan, then it's good how it is"
6/22/2010,"how about this for ccp to disburden the servers and generate more traffic between the hubs.gallente and minmatar / caldari and amarr have a close relatioship already (see standings gain).how about that jita and amarr are bound together via a ""transwarp"" gate (star trek term i know). likewise dodixie and rens. but - the big con would be the equalization of prices in those two/four hubs. if that is what you want?about the shortening via low sec - eve travelling is already dangerous enough in high sec as you have many many ganks on the way from dixi to jita. putting low secs in between only makes this worse."

6/22/2010,"more so, i was speaking with regard to pos production in general. i do enough of it - and not in wormholes - that i consider it an important ability to have in game. it has its own set of annoyances, but -25% build time forgives many sins. for the record though, i do not want to see csaas get anchored in wormholes. supercaps being barred from wormholes is nice, and not something i wish to see changed."
6/22/2010,"as most will agree, fw needs a revamp to make it more beneficial and appealing to all those involved. as such, i propose the following changes be made to fw as a whole.1. systems are captured by systematically capturing 4 control points.a. control point 1 only allows <= destroyer sized vessels and takes 10 minutes to capture. (0 lp for capture / 10 lp for defending)b. control point 2 only allows <= battlecruiser sized vessels and takes 15 minutes to capture.(0 lp for capture / 25 lp for defending)c. control point 3 allows all ship sizes and takes 20 minutes to capture. (0 lp for capture / 50 lp for defending)d. control point 4 allows all ship sizes, takes 30 minutes to capture and posts to the respective militia fw channel ""the ____ are currently capturing ______ from you! you have 30 minutes to defend our sovereign space!"". (250 lp for capture, +0.2% faction gain -0.2% opposing faction loss / 100 lp for defending, +0.1% faction gain).the control points require the subsequent point to be captured before the next one will open (i.e. control point 1 must be captured to open control point 2 for capture). there are no npcs in these control points. the control points reset back to the previous ""level"" if the defending militia captures the control point (i.e. minmatar is attacking an amarr cp 3, the amarr amass a fleet to defend the system and fight the minmatar back. the amarr capture cp 3 and it closes reopening cp 2).2. capturing a system for your militia will reward members of your militia with the following:1. 5% reduced repair costs in the system2. 5% increased lp / isk / standings increase from missions in the system3. 5% increased pi & pos productivitysubsequently, losing a system will result in:1. 5% increased repair costs in the system2. 5% reduced lp / isk / standings increase from missions in the system3. 5% decreased pi & pos productivity3. systems are ""locked out"" from being recaptured for 8 hours (timer visible to all in system) at which time the system is re-open for capture (but does not automatically revert back to the ""original"" militia sovereignty).4. overall militia gains based on sovereignty:a. 50% of available systems captured - no gainb. 60% of available systems captured - 5% lp store discountc. 70% of available systems captured - 5% lp store discount & 5% lp gaind. 80% of available systems captured - 5% lp store discount, 5% lp gain and 5% isk gaine. 90% of available systems captured - 5% lp store discount, 5% lp gain, 5% isk gain, 5% discount on repairs, market fees and commissions from npcsi believe making the aforementioned changes will do the following:1. encourage a need and necessity for your militia to actively participate in system capturing.2. provide a ""risk and reward"" for taking and losing systems to the opposing militia.3. prevent exploitation of fw lp gain and rewards due to the 8 hour timer preventing people from ""trading off"" sovereignties.4. these changes do not force people to participate in pvp, however it does encourage them to do so for the rewards it offers.conclusion:fw is based on a war with your opposing militia. as such it should benefit and encourage the fighting of that war on all fronts and at all times. by offering rewards to the capturing of the enemies systems it provides a reward for all members to be active and does their part for their militia as the rewards benefit everyone whether they want to pvp or pve."
6/22/2010,acid sniper nice work on that proposal. let me ask some questions about it before i give support though:i'm assuming there would be plexes for your control point 1 2 and 3. so you can only bring the designated ship type or lower in. is that correct? ( minor point: you have bc and down for level 2. why not t1 cruiser and down? level 3 bc and down and level 4 open. this is how the gangs are usually divided in fw.)would one of these 4 control point levels be open in *every* system except for those in a 8 hour cool down? i have to say that sounds awesome to me. but it may be a bit too many. maybe half the systems until the numbers in fw start growing. i wonder though if we should have information about *every* plex/control point being entered.(even 1-3) if we dont know when and where people are taking plexes (even control points 1-3) we may have the same hide and go seek problems we currently have. it should also be a rule that if you get chased out of range of the control point the timer restarts for you back at zero. that way people wont go in there warp off wait until you leave then immediately go back in. it would be nice if the fw map showed what types of control points were open in each system. so if you wanted to take a frigate gang (cruiser and down bc and down etc.) out you could find the systems with those open.as far as your awards they are a nice balance not so overwhelming people will run alarm clock ops but still something decent to fight for. consider the possibilities with people who have alts in both militias. would they have the alt start the timer than the other alt come to defend it? if who entered what control points was announced in an intel channel this wouldnt be a problem.
6/22/2010,"that's correct, only those ship types would be allowed into the respective control points (i.e. no bss in cp 1's).i didn't want to stipulate based on tier of ship as i don't feel it's really necessary. you could, technically, capture all 4 cps with a frigate if you want. however, since cruisers and bcs are typically used in groups together i didn't want to differentiate between them. correct, every system not currently on the 8 hour countdown would have open cps (all based on what has / hasn't been captured). i thought about that, but my delima came into the implemenation of that into the world map (which already can take a while to load up and could generate greater server load), or to have messages sent to the militia's chat (which i also opted against due to it potentially creating a lot of spam). that's why i resorted to only a message being sent for cp4 being captured as that is the longest point to capture as well as unrestrictive in ship types. there is a possibility of adding a tab to the militia page potentially but i was trying to keep things as easy (development wise) as i could.that is a great suggestion, i was thinking something along the lines of ""if no one is in range of the cp for 2 minutes? it resets back to 0"". this would prevent it from resetting automatically by accidently traveling outside of the cp but also prevent warp out / ins solo. thoughts?agreed, could be implemented into what i recommended above regarding a tab on the militia pane which could be accessible anywhere so as to not overload the world map. thanks, my intentions were to prevent people from getting a buddy from an opposing militia and just trading control points off, but to also allow the controlling militia enough time in the system to make use of the rewards. that was one of my concerns, however that's why i eliminated a lp gain for the attacking militia. i think if the above changes were in effect regarding the map on the militia tab (or something to that effect) it could help prevent that, as well as 10 minutes for only 10 lp would take a long time for it to truly be benefitial to trade it back and forth for instance."
6/22/2010,"this is great, except for the lp gain from capturing a plex. 0 lp for attacking and 25 for defending? 25 lp is worthless, even 250 is worthless. most people would rather do missions, even with all the other benefits."
6/22/2010,"i have an additional ""feature"" that i believe should be in fw. its simple. promotes pvp. lots of enjoyment. an is already happening elsewhere in game!live (fw) eventsthese events would be similar to the sansha incursions. faction a bridges a naval fleet into faction b's space. maybe above a planet and attempts to raid/damage or destroy faction b's assets on grid. these assets could be anything from a spawned naval shipyards, naval logistics convoys, planetary assets or a destructable station. faction a will be a large fleet of npc navy vessels led by a (actor) capsuleer. faction b could even spawn a (actor) capsuleer led npc fleet and the two fleets could duke it out. militia would then run to support their factions navy, either through logistical support or brute force. the npc's should have the infamous ""sleeper ai"" and similar rr fits but within empire technologies. npc's will not pod kill but may smartbomb so you need to be careful.watcha think?otherwise, i really like your proposal.+1"
6/22/2010,"i fear that if we are not notified of the other cps (1-3) being taken this will not change things for the better. all the lower level cps will be taken by hide and seek plexers in frigates with warp core stabs and ecm bursts. and then the highest cp will be taken by a blob. if we are going to ask ccp to fix this lets make sure it gets done right. if they want to say its too much work to do it right well at least we asked. but if you dont ask they wont do it even if its easy to do. the only way to make sure we dont have hide and seek plexing is to make sure the militias know when and where a plex is being taken. i do not think it would be hard for ccp to have a notification system. there would be 2 chat tabs completely separate from militia chat. one tab for the caldari-gallente regions and one for the minmatar amarr regions. you can close the tab for the region you are not in. it would simply post messages like. no one could post in these tabs it would just contain intel about the plexes/cps. eg,[22:03]kamela, cp1, amarr:cearain, destroyer. people could choose to defend if they want. 10 minutes is plenty long for people to arrive if they want a fight. but if people think they may be able to sneak plexes whithout others knowing they will run them in frigates with ecm bursts and warp core stabs.i would strongly urge you to include the notifications for cps 1-3 in your proposal. i think thats a great idea."
6/22/2010,"i agree in principle, only if there is a warning message sent somewhere to all militia players. also i would add that only the current ""front line"" systems should have active control points (ie the systems either side of a gate which connects a gallente held system and a caldari held system)."
6/22/2010,"nice. although calling it a ""fix"" in the title is little disingenuous. ""revamp"" as you have in your proposal is much more suited.anyways fw doesn't need a ""fix"", because that would imply that the only problem with fw would be the faulty mechanics involved when really its the fact that those mechanics are crappy in the first place even if they worked 100% correctly."
6/22/2010,"so, having read the forums recently this has reared it's ugly head again. corps dropping alliances to protect their poses or players dropping corps and reforming.here's an idea:the cooldown on role removals and dropping from an alliance is increased to 48 hours if your corp/alliance has a pending or active wardec against it.simples."
6/22/2010,"i find it hard to believe that the intricate details behind invulnerable pos's and the even more intricate process of abusing the same mechanic differently to make them no longer invulnerable was an integral part of ccp's original plan for the wardec system.cautious support given, knowing full well that if ccp were to look at wardecs they would more than likely **** them up completely rather than fix anything in particular."
6/22/2010,"i have my doubts ccps original plan for wardecs was wardeccing rookie corporations for easy kills with station camping slaved clones supported by neutral guardians.there are no consequences to starting wardec, and none to evading them, seems fine to me."
6/22/2010,should be a week for corps/alliances tbh.
6/22/2010,"i totally support this idea, i see this happen way too often."
6/22/2010,why have a wardec mechanic if it is easily avoidable?npc corps are there for those that want risk free 'play'.supported.
6/22/2010,well seeing as it's been stated multiple times by staff that evading wardecs is naughty i find your argument absurd sir.
6/22/2010,make it longer k
6/22/2010,yes.
6/22/2010,"not supported. it takes long enough to switch corporations, you might for instance find that the wardec corp you just entered does not fit your style, and want to leave it again."
6/22/2010,don't ask for roles when you first join?
6/22/2010,"better solution - the war continues for anyone who ditches corp/alliance. and not just for 24h, but for the whole week."
6/22/2010,would their new corp be in the war or just them? keep in mind sometimes people change corps for legitimate reasons.
6/22/2010,no sorry. no.
6/22/2010,"just them. basically, the war applies to the people who were in the target group as of the time the war went live for that week, plus whoever chooses to join them. if you leave, you get out after a week, unless they choose to dec your new group or something."
6/22/2010,"tldr; waawaaa pi is a clickfest i quit. but seriously: change the extract mechanic from a high-pull short duration vs slow-pull long duration to a high-pull low efficiency vs slow-pull high efficiency system. ok, to begin with, here are my thoughts on the whole extractor system: imo, there is no strategy in choosing an extractor pull type aside from trying to predict when you'll log in the next day. there is no brainsweat involved, and just rewards poopsockers. some might argue that if you are willing to work out your index finger then you deserve more planet goo, but i call shenanigans. i would prefer having a system that rewarded a good strategy instead. how would such a system work? ... uh i'm actually not sure... but i can throw out a suggestion:since we know that extractors deplete resource areas, and that hotspots drift around, we could use that mechanic. say a certain hotspot has 1 million units of resources available. if you have your extractor plant set to the maximum pull rate, it will deplete the pocket at a rate of 2000 units per cycle but gives you only 500 units per cycle. however, if you set your extractors at the minimum rate, you pull only 150 units per cycle, but work more efficiently and deplete the resource pocket at a rate of 160 units per cycle. as the pocket is depleted, have nearby areas develop (spawn) new hotspots. so once you finish pillaging the local lands, you'll have to tear down and relocate your extractors to the new hotspot(s). with the new system, you would have to choose between sucking a pocket dry in a few days and losing 75% of your potential yield, or slowly sipping away over the course of a week and getting a juicy 90% yield. of course, any variation in between would also be available. since hotspots get depleted, you would have to pay isk for new extractors which add a new variable to the profitability of your current strategy: you would have to determine if the higher pull rate is worth the extra cost of needing to replace your extractors more frequently. now why do i think this is a good idea? well, personally, i have a blast setting up the colony, but once that's done, it becomes a case of ""now what?"" for me. there is not much left to do aside from the tedious clickfest of refreshing your extractors. with the proposed changes, pi will a bit be more about the fun part: building and improving the infrastructure.finally, while we're at it, some random bits:two players on the same hotspot would have a much greater effect since the hotspot is essentially halved in its resource amount. the extraction rates are still dependent on the quality of the hotspot. instead of tearing down extractors, maybe have them be mobile and move them at a cost. then you can crushinate all the peons that stand in the way between you and the next juicy pocket.for some added strategy, increase the export tax for cc and launchpads the further away they are from the equator. and/or add a space elevator pin that can be placed only on the equator and has no tax.also your standard pi complaints: make command centers upgradable, make command centers useful, make storage useful, more informative pins, etc, etc.imo even my suggestion does not completely mitigate the ""reward grind vs. strategy"" problem, but its a start by replacing the clickfest with a rebuild-your-infrastructure-fest. so, any suggestions, complaints and trolls welcome.ps: it must be really windy on those planets, cause those clouds are zooming across the landscape... and by windy i'm talking on the order of supersonic speeds..."
6/22/2010,more like: tl;poorly formated and impossible to read.also quiting isn't really a proposal. i mean what the response you were looking for? yay maor for me?
6/22/2010,"pi is a great little game.lots of choices, lots of strategic directions to take.all of these strategic choice and the game-play that comes with it is 100% completely broken.wack-a-mole is not a game of intelligence or creativity.for those that enjoy playing wack-a-mole, maybe keep the extractors.however the 36h cycle should be renamed continuous so that those that enjoy the strategy but not the clicking can still enjoy pi.my hand is not worth the isk/hr. i will not swap the health of my hand for 150 coolant.i will however continue to enjoy pi if i don't have to refresh extractors."
6/22/2010,"hi,i came across a topic which was about ""buying"" training speed."
6/22/2010,i do not think 0.0 needs a boost. not supported
6/22/2010,i am curious - why do you think that 0.0 doesnt need more people? are you a high sec player only?
6/22/2010,"im not against the idea myself (though i believe +5 might be too high, stick 1-3 would be less of an overwhelming advantage), i just don't think it would be possible.notice how you have to pause the training queue whenever you imput a new implant, or jump clones? i suspect this might be because the training queue can't refresh itself on the fly if things effecting it change (learning skill +'s work, but these are applied between skills when you finish your learning skill, so there must be a refresh point then).therefore, i believe it wouldn't work, as the training queue wouldn't be able to handle jumping from a upgraded system to a non-upgraded one (its possible ccp could make the queue refresh when you zone between systems, but if it were already possible, we wouldn't need to pause training when using jump clones, as we would get that refresh then)."
6/22/2010,"not to mention adding this refresh could potentially shove skills at the very end of the queue off if it lengthened enough. i don't want to have to check my queue everytime i change systems, thanks."
6/22/2010,"it's way too powerful, and it makes no sense whatsoever. this is not the boost 0.0 needs (lag fix plox)"
6/22/2010,"yet another post by someone who doesn't like the fact that training take real time. working on mining barge v, are you? htfu. if anything should be done to learning (and i think nothing should be done), then the skills removed, along with their bonuses.then it can take everyone longer to train skills and have new toys.everyone starts the game from the same basic place. choices you make - yes choices you make - affect how long it takes you to do anything in the game.now that i've ranted, let's get real - how exactly is this a ""realistic"" mechanic? is there some sort of sub-space field that enhances your skills while sitting in a single system? do you have special implants that can tie into that field? can you provide any supporting physics or engineering sciene to enable this kind of idea?didn't think so..."
6/22/2010,"no i am not. as a matter of fact i am ok with the learnings as they are now. having heard of the wish to learn faster i had the idea and wanted to contribute.glad to see that its not only ranting you do you just did name the idea. you do know the sticker which are on a computer games etc when you buy them? originally they where for distinguishing friend / foes during the 2nd world war in airplanes. the same idea became the first theft tags which cause alert when you leave the shop. the same system, but with sub-space, could be applied in game. say you have all +4 implants. with the upgrade +3 you could source out ""brain calculation"" time into a computer and therefore enhance learning by +3 like the upgrade has. if the upgrade would be a +5 you still could do max +4 as you have that kind of implants in. the current implants would work as well as transmitter and receiver."

6/22/2010,"you, sir, are an idiot"
6/22/2010,absolutely!
6/22/2010,"i think we all would like to have more reasons not to fight in large blobs and i would like ccp to keep looking into objectives that avoid the need for blobbing.in order the avoid the problems with time zones the game encourages scheduled fights at fixed infrastructure where it only makes sense to bring the biggest blob possible.given the number of players in the game and the application architecture there will always be a limit to what the servers can handle and a reason for alliances to blob past those numbers.i thus propose a solution like this (or something similar).the server monitors the performance of a system and when it detects it is getting close to overloading it will warp random pilots to a special cpp safe-spot.while at the safe-spot a pilot will get minimal game state updates and is not able to do anything but wait or log-off.when people die and leave local more players are allowed back into the fight when the game releases players from the safe-spot.you could have bad luck and have your fc or a key ship go inactive but that really is not any worse than what currently happens when a node lags out.example:alliance 1: 10 titans, 100 bs, 300 bcalliance 2: 5 titans, 300 bs, 50 hacssystem overloaded so random 30% goes inactive to the safe-spot. active in the fight (with no lag!)alliance 1: 7 titans, 65 bs, 220 bcalliance 2: 3 titans, 210 bs, 35 hacsas ships get killed and pilots leave the system the two fleets get reinforced with reactivated pilots.again i am not saying this is the one and only solution but that ccp should design a solution like this where the fight can go on (somewhat) fairly even once way more ships attempt to join than the system can handle."
6/22/2010,"you are trying to fix a broken player mentality with a game-mechanic.i disagree with this out of the simple reason that the game should not dictate where i warp or where i go to, nor prevent me from going where i'd like."
6/22/2010,but it already does that right now: when you dc or look at a black screen or get minutes of activation lag.this proposal is just to keep it fair and playable for the people actually in the fight when the server runs out of hamsters.
6/22/2010,"i think a big problem is going to be choosing what 30% to take out of the battle, namely losing fcs, logi, titans etc. maybe letting people volunteer to be moved to the safespot with a special checkbox so that titans and such arent removed/"
6/22/2010,i think having control over what ships are removed from the fight would get abused. you could brings 10 capitals with the 'do not deactivate flag' together with 300 noob ships to force some of the enemy ships off the field while not having significant losses yourself.but in the end i see that as an implementation detail. the real proposal is that blobs will exceed server capacity and that the system should deal with that gracefully and fairly. support this petition in you agree with that.
6/22/2010,"i get the impression this is going to fix many of the giant headaches we currently have. the networking bit might be the most important part of that entire dev blog. we'll find out tomorrow (or the next day, depending on how long this takes)."
6/22/2010,"i hope so but i fear that in the big wars alliances will just bring more ships before they lag out again. i just want to get rid of the whole ""the alliance who loads grid first wins"" gameplay."
6/22/2010,"instead of fighting the symptoms we should rather:a) help ccp finding the bugs that cause the current lagb) finding ways that encourage smaller gangs.maybe look at this proposal, it tries to give small gangs something to do and also make them influence the whole sov warfare scheme.randomly warping ships out of the fight is definitely not supported."
6/22/2010,i like new ways to do damage to an opponent that does not require a big blob but even with these added you would still have situations where you want to concentrate all the firepower you can find.- wanting to bubble camp the main station of an enemy system.- wanting to kill a titan building in an enemy pos.as was seen during the north vs south war these kind of fights do happen but currently suck because of lag. which also randomly messes up your gameplay. what would your prefer? randomly lose your ship (current situation) or randomly get sidelined for a while (new proposal)?also the new proposal would spread the problem evenly over all the parties in the system instead of giving a huge advantage to the first ones there. the fact that the server could not keep up should not have a great impact on which party wins eventually.
6/22/2010,"as both are random, neither of those.i would like ccp to reduce the hp of all the sov relevant stuff so that you dont have to bring 100+ people to efficiently kill some structure.atm i think the way of capturing systems in faction warfare is better than the 0.0 hitpoint grind. the proposed solution in the thread of making upgrades easily destroyable by small gangs and progressively bringing the system closer to being taken, might make the whole sov thingie more fun. then we might only see 2 meat grinding fights (1 to bring the tcu into rf, and another to kill it).the rest of the time will be small gangs nuking the sov upgrades. less people to bring to the fights, less people needed to defend a system. even if you wont achieve your goal of destroying the upgrade, you might get a fight from the locals."

6/22/2010,"game balance has no bearing on a player driven economy aside from making sure no one person or group can exploit the mechanics at the expensive of others.in short, people charge what the market will bear for items. obviously people are, for whatever reason, wiling to pay more for the modules than they are for the ships."

6/22/2010,"you're really talking about two things here:one is the balance of used tags to unused tags, the other is the pricing of objects.i can name at least one module that doesn't use any of the insignias you have in your used list - the republic fleet gyroscope. it uses general and coloneol insignias. so it may be that the insignias are used, just not for the objects your're looking at.don't forget that different corporations have different lp stores (and that doesn't include the faction warfare ones). also, faction warfare lp purcahsses tend to ""cost"" less than comprable non-fw ones, which may account for part of the price discrepancies you're observing (i.e. it cost me less to make, so i can afford to sell if for less, and retain the same profit margin).also, why isn't this in gd or markets?"
6/22/2010,"i would like to se as well as my corpmates a way to upgrade our collonies without having to rebuild everything again, as when you have a good layout it is hard to get it put back the same exact way you had it before. also it would be nice if there was a way to link corpmates colonies if we are on the same planet would allow for easier trading of supplies between corp mates."
6/22/2010,"i was looking through the market for initiated ion field ecm i in 3 different regions (including jita) and couldn't find a single item. also, the table shows almost no sales for the last month (think about 4 of them in the last month), so i'm sure there is an issue with the loot tables in tyrannis, unless ccp really wanted this item to be more rare then a tournament prizei think this needs a fix"
6/22/2010,"here we go with that ""other players shouldn't be allowed to do things that hurt me"" garbage yet again. what makes you so freaking special that you should be protected from interference in this multiplayer pvp game? you already have multiple ways of dealing with thieves. you can get to the mission item first, you can warp out and hope the rats chase him off, or you can shoot him, because he voluntarily gave you kill rights on him. all of these options have their pros and cons. if you aren't willing to take any of these actions in favor of begging for the developers to hand you everything you want on a silver platter, prepare to be ridiculed and disappointed."
6/22/2010,"clearly, you don't.he offered to sell it back to you. i presume you said no. that was smart, he'll remember you next time and he won't waste his time trying to steal your item to sell it back to you, see how you won?you lost the battle, but won the war, imagine how he feels?i bet he petitioned the gm because you griefed him by him wasting his time stealing your stuff, and then you, you.... you didn't buy it back off him.did you also notice that cancelling off your mission didn't have any negative effects at all? i mean, yes you lost a little tiny teensy weensy amount of standing, but not enough to affect anything at all?well guess what that thief lost.... he lost face. he gets to go back to his corpmates and tell them how he completely failed to secure a lucrative extortion deal. he has to work a lot harder to regain his lost standing with his own corpmates than you ever will to regain your standing with whatever npc corp that was.i know who i would rather be, and it's you, because you superpwned that guy."

6/22/2010,smuggling mods for the win
6/22/2010,"as per the eula, section 7, subsection a.2 and a.3 --------2. you may not use your own or third-party software to modify any content appearing within the game environment or change how the game is played.3. you may not use macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items, currency, objects, character attributes, rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game play. you may not rewrite or modify the user interface or otherwise manipulate data in any way to acquire items, currency, objects, character attributes or beneficial actions not actually acquired or achieved in the game.--------this is just a proposal for the csm5 to add macro/'boting specifically to the list of issues to talk to ccp about.for purposes of this proposal when i say ""macro"", ""bots"", ""boting"" i mean programs that are allowing players to not be at their computer. basically putting their character on 'autopilot' doing a certain set of actions over and over again for the purpose of making large amounts of isk be it thru ore/trade/missioning/ratting.working on this issue will require development/game master/customer service departmental time and i think we need to support this as a customer priority so that ccp feel they can devote time to it. this topic didn't seem to be on the list of 29 things that csm4 turned in @ here or current discussion topics for csm5 @ here. the issue had been brought up in a general discussion of mining only @ hereif it's not on their priority list the csm should request it be added. if it's already on the list(from a different previous csm), and can be talked about then a suggestion for a devblog post on progress would be my proposal for the csm. it's also possible this is already being worked on, but releasing operational info would compromise their plan to deal with it. having it on the topics list for csm5 would at least mean that it's been talked about specifically.current mechanics to report/remove:current game mechanics of players filing petitions when they noticed suspect activity isnt working to remove the problems in a programmatic way. an increase in petitions would also likely overwhelm the gm/isd folk who may or may not have the tools to effectively identify and deal with players using bot accounts.in-game player-run events like hulkageddon help in random spurts to get rid of chunks of mining bot/macro characters; however, its effect is sadly temporary, seems to focus primarily on high-sec, and lately seems to have devolved into simply the suicide ganking of any mining character. previous iterations of hulkageddon have mentioned specifically going after afk/macro miners.trader bots/macros are a little easier to spot for experienced traders. at exactly the same time/interval buy/sell orders are changed on a 23/7 basis usually by fractions of an isk to lower/raise their merchandise above/below their competitors. this type of action is called competition when youre actually fighting in the market with another person, but when it is a person vs. a bot/macro the person always loses because they eventually need to sleep. players petition when they notice something like this happening but more often than not the market stability is temporary as the accounts are likely to show back up in a day or two, or can be trained on trial accounts.i dont have firsthand experience with the bot/macro rat/mission farmers, just read about them in posts here. sounds similar to the maro miners. jump to roid belt, target and destroy rats, warp to next roid belt and repeat 23 hours a day.effect on game:<continued in next post>"
6/22/2010,"effect on game:mining bot/macro removal:more than changing loot drops this change will likely drastically affect ore/mineral prices initially. people who took the time to learn the mining skills and actually put the effort into piloting there ships in real time will be rewarded for their effort. quantity on the ore/minerals on the market will drop, prices will rise. the hulk will likely stop being the most piloted ship in eve due to the fact that a percentage of the pilots are actually alt bot/macro accounts used to suck isk/ore from the system for other characters purposes. null/low-sec corps will likely have to recruit more industrial players thus drawing industrial players from empire space.trading bot/macro removal:the spectacle of a trader bot/macro lowering prices on an object to at or below the cost of actually making the object will hopefully cease to be an occurrence. traders will not need to be super-human to be able to trade and make a living/profit at it. overall market stability and the increased interaction, and satisfaction by real time players will likely be the result. i do not consider myself an expert on this category, just an informed novice.ratting bot/macro removal:whether for sec standing or isk players will have to work like the rest of us to make their money/standing.suggestions:to be truthful i'm not sure how to tackle this one. i've seen a lot of people suggesting different options:"
6/22/2010,"so your proposal is basically to acknowledge that macros are bad and ccp should ban people who use them. i mean, i agree with that of course, but i'm not really sure what you think this thread will accomplish in that regard. they already do this, a lot."
6/22/2010,"after reading the stickies this is how i understand the process to be:for the csm to bring up a topic, debate it internally, and then bring it up to ccp a topic has to come up here in this forum first.so this is me bringing up the topic, so that players can support it, so that the csm can debate it, and then bring it to ccp as a priority. hopefully that's clear.i left off all the personal opinions on ""how"" to fix it because i don't have a good one and it's not really my job other then to state it should be fixed, and ask for support for my statement.i'm hoping people will support the idea, csm picks up the idea and debates the effect of macro/bot accounts, determine it 'of consequence' and adds it to their agenda as a thing they would like ccp to address."
6/22/2010,that goes hand in hand with evel's pos overhaul. and will probably be done at the same time..(never)
6/22/2010,"i'd like to point out a small error in my statement about keeping a refining array busy with one mining frigate. i admittedly didn't do the math correctly.because actually, with one mining frigate extracting 40,753m<U+FFFD> in 90 minutes (navitas, 2x miner ii, 1x mining laser upgrade i, mining foreman mindlink from the hauler), you can keep two medium intensive arrays busy or, with 3 frigates (ca. 244,518m<U+FFFD> in 180 minutes, a big intensive). frigates."
6/22/2010,oh god how did i get here i not very good with computer
6/22/2010,i approve of this product or service
6/22/2010,i support and fully approve authenticator keyfob style units for eve.they aren't perfect but they do reduce the window of opportunity someone has down to a few min at most.
6/22/2010,"sure, i support either giving them the skill they need to complete the tutorial, or telling them how to get it. what kind of new-player tutorial requires you to know something beyond the tutorial itself in order to finish it?"
6/22/2010,the aggro system in this game is more arcane and convoluted than american tax law. i support any attempt to fix it or at least make it more visible who has aggro to who.
6/22/2010,it's funny how the russian localized client already has a way better font than the english client...
6/22/2010,too often i see people throwing npc starter corps characters into systems ahead of themselves to scout their actual more important characters through areas that they already know are dangerous. the major problem with this is that as the altscout is inevitably killed several dozen times it just keeps moving its medical clone to the nearest medbay facility so it can go back to being thrown in front of the real character to reveal anything unpleasant. i propose that npc starter corp characters be confined to only having clonebay access to stations that belong to their npc corp. if you want a freebie scout to scout your dumb ass through choppy waters your going to have to fly him from empire space each time it dies.

6/22/2010,"i would like to know which one of the following csms focus is 0.0 specifically the nap train abuse and blobardmentthis isnt a flame at any powerbloc since all powerblocs equally abuse diplomacy thanks to ego and fear, however one of things that caught my eye when the 0.0 elections were going on was that certain people would focus on ending blob warfare sadly i forgot who these people were.please note i have read up on sov history as well as been in several alliances who strangely enough hate nap trains yet certain replies i have gotten have been in favour of it.this isnt a discussion about that though, i would just like to know the names of the elected csm that will be focusing in 0.0 and in these areasthanks in advance :)"
6/23/2010,i concur.

6/23/2010,"support for blaster rebalance, infact support for a overall balance pass/look at gallente in general. lets keep this thread going"
6/23/2010,"no they are not. they already get bbq'd faster than a witch in salem by cruisers, they need more slots because if their hps and sig radius dont change, at least they can tank a little better or actually put on some different useful modules to make them more useful as a ship with higher versatility. they lack versatility which is their main problem, their bonuses are flawed, which is their second, their fittings aren't right, which their tertiary flaw, and the final flaw is that their sig radius makes them instapop from cruisers. you know how easy ac's rip up frigs? a cruiser is twice the sig radius of a frig, slower, and has only about 30% more hp than a frig.the coercer only has 1 mid. try doing anything useful with that ship. its like having to choose between speed to avoid damage and catch up to targets, or cap boosters to keep moving at a snail pace without running out of cap.personally, i'd like to see a 4% bonus per level to afterburner speed, with a 1% increase in cap use for afterburner.you know whats funny is that this ship could have all kinds of different bonuses set on it to make it better, but each bonus, if its related to a module would effectively fitting out the other modules.like if it had an ab bonus, and a tracking computer bonus, and a cap battery bonus, and a web bonus. on ships with only 1 or 2 midslots, you can only choose two at most, and if the bonuses weren't to op, then a particular fight would favor switching out a bonused mod for an unbonused one that would be more helpful in a particular fight.there's tons of ways to improve ships, not just with buffs to stats but also with new bonuses that, if taken advantage of, take a slot away from being able to use another bonus.battlecruisers are solo pvp lowsec ships in droves. that doesn't compare to a ship relegated to salvaging for everyone."
6/23/2010,i got something to say. put in two of the small rigs that increase fire rate 10%. dps is huge then. these rigs also tend to be pretty cheap. i think the only answer is to tank destroyers because otherwise the frigs they're supposed to kill take them out instead.

6/23/2010,"please, please.. had to add some more people to the contact list again, and it's a frigging pain.not only that you can't tell who is who anymore without custom folders. the adding process itself is driving me insane.was only 50 names, but instead of being able to drag/drop them into the standing folders, you have to right-click every single name, set standing for every single name, toggle ""add to watchlist"" for every single name - instead of being able to make the settings for the folder, then drag/drop names into it.why?!i'm serious when i'm saying that this is taking the enjoyment out of the game for me. never felt the need to come to the forums and complain about an expansion before, but this is just bad.if you can't get it to work with eve gate, freeze the project and give us a working watchlist again, with a proper ui that won't give your customers suicidal tendencies over adding a handful of names."
6/23/2010,"to the op you should add that ccp should bring back the old contact limit,which was near endless, now it's 300 contacts top, for a mmo like eve a sandbox game where anyday you can meet a new person you want to keep contact with when you thnk about it 300 is a pretty low limit. ccp stated that less than 1 % of the game would be effected what they dident state was if it was 1% of all accounts exsisting (alts, isk sellers, inactives etc) or if the 1% was just a made up number to get us of their backs. which ever way you look at it. there was no justifyed reason for removing the endless contact limit unless it was the sole cause of lag or something like this, which they stated it was not."
6/23/2010,"supported. further, drop the minimum number of members requirement. ahs"
6/23/2010,supported
6/23/2010,"yes, i was trying to look for a 2005 one tbh, 2007 wasnt really a great example and i know i shouldnt dwell in the past but considering how many smaller powerblocs were there then, not to mention more conflictlets be real here this was a more of a trend from the start than anything diplomatic, there was far more global warfare none of this north vs south bull****, surely even someone who spent time killing off the southern naptrain for years could understand this?this again isnt about removing diplomacy but making it in such a way to make 0.0 less about blobbing and more about strategy, node crashing isnt what i would call strategy, or would you prefer to spend the next 7 years being part of the same depressing sc vs nc warfare?i dont want smaller alliances to have an advantage i just want them to have a chance, my strategy doesnt even include 0.0 anymore, thats like asking some small island to take on nato lol but even if i wanted to go in 0.0 (out of npc world) it would require something of a similar size in order to achieve anything which is funny since eve isnt rl diplomacy shouldnt be so square.options now are for any alliance / corpbecome a petroam only because its going to be impossible getting space in anything less than 30k members (within your whole naptree)be part of one of the three depressing coalitions who resort to the same tricks (blobbing & naping) as each other"
6/23/2010,here's an idea for you.instead of posting ******ed idiot ideas like this one...go out and shoot your nap'd buddies.you wanted excitement... go get it.don't like blues? shoot them. no ones stopping you.
6/23/2010,after 3 years of doing that it kindda becomes more of a chore than anything but thanks for assuming i never did this
6/23/2010,it's only human nature to seek the extremes of everything and manage to make it the worst possible situation for everyone involved. no arbitrary limitations will help avoid this.
6/23/2010,this
6/23/2010,"pardon, what? not sure if i fell into some kind of time warp and landed in five years ago, but right now there's absolutely no way of going into null without joining the nearest coalition. you're either so small that your supply line will draw attention, or big enough to field jump freight logistics, in which case your op will be noticed going in. in both situations, you can expect to be blown off the map within a few days of setting up camp.i see no problem allowing big naps to exist if peopel are so inclined, but to suggest everyone has the chance to break out and start playing to the beat of their own drum (or set up elsewhere un-noticed) is lunacy."
6/23/2010,"this i must admit has to be one of my more interesting threads i have made to a point where i was rather curious about the comments, anyway it brought about alot of in game activity too.anyway after spending last few hours talking to people (and getting interrupted by many people) i am led to believe that there is a strong % that dislikes naping and blobbing but for those who have achieved what they have through naping and blobbing do not wish for it to be taken away.i would like to remind everyone of a pre dominion thread where a huge % (based in 0.0) were annoyed by the fact that they would have to pay for sov i dont think i have to remind you which one ed ;), the characteristics of these types of replies are much similar to the people in this thread.again i am not against diplomacy or cap warfare or hotdropping, but i do find and i am certain many others do too, having 0.0 split into 3 naps and 3 categories makes it a very ugly place.many alliances complain over and over they want smaller alliances to come in 0.0, they want people to leave empire so it confuses me why people wouldnt consider a diplomacy / warfare revamp.oh and i found out which csms wanted to change blob warfare and was actually very surprised to find vuk lau of morsus mihi had it as one of his point of interests or so i am lead to believe.so theres a strong inconsistency even within 0.0 on how people feel about this, some people dont like transitions dominion alone proved this if anything some dont want their hard work ruined by changes.edit - naping everything within 40 - 60 jumps, nice to see people complaining about not having anything todo in 0.0 contradict much?"
6/23/2010,"power blocks is what works. plain and simple. why be independent and risk getting absolutely decimated when you can be part of a power block and be safer?bottom line is risk free pvpppppppppppppppp is the current way of this game. you just don't get eve.all of the player base likes it this way or they would not do it. you are simply an alt who tried to do things without ultra napping and was kicked in the teeth hard. so now you come to the forums and try to convince everyone that bringing 1000 friends is the reason for lag and such things.we like the entire north being best friends forever. we get to live in peace. do mining, mission running, anamolies, etc and not have to worry about some losers who live a few jumps away deciding to stop by and mess it up.i for one enjoy carebearing in complete safety and no one coming close to me and me knowing about it for 30+ jumps so i have plenty of time to get safe. we create intel channels, cyno jamm systems, mass bubble the gates to create an environment that we like. it is a sandbox, why should i not have it my way?again, when you learn how to make friends like we have, then you can come up and claim a little bit of space. that is if we don't bring all of our friends to keep you from doing it. so just give up and try and strike a deal as a pet and stop trying to doing something by yourself with what patheic alliance mates you have. this is 0.0, you need a lot of people and i mean a lot if you want to do something and not be a pet, or have your sandcastle quickly annihilated.nothing more to see here people, just some sore loser who does not understand what mmorp stands for. here is a hit: ""massive multi-player"" learn it buddy."
6/23/2010,"priceless post.anyhow, yea, it's like i said in your other thread fist. the only ones who can do anything about it politically, like the easy street they find themselves in now. they have absolutely nothing to gain but more agressive neighbors and fewer pets, so why would they support breaking naps?come to think of it, you're pretty spot on in assuming it would take an act of ccp to end this. that being said, i wouldn't look for any csm candidate from the nc to suggest it."
6/23/2010,"why would we push for anything that would hurt our current situation? we like being a power block, and a power block is how it is going to stay. ccp will not be for breaking up power blocks either so you might as well put forth your effort into other things that really do need fixed like some regions anomalies being broken or something."
6/23/2010,"i read what you said and i am so glad we are on the same level i am sorry you got got confused though, eitherway you agreed with me in the end you just assumed i was talking about something else hehedit - for the sake of this thread much like my predecessor i will right this in big bolded caps for those mentally ******ed players.1. 0.0 is split into 3 naps2. most naps have everything blue within 40 - 60 jumps3. most alliances do this because they are worried that 4. xxx will kill them therefore blobbing is the only skill required5. however most alliances want empire to leave and come to 0.06. 0.0 people dont like empire and feel 0.0 is underpopulated7. empire dont like huge naps where 0.0 to them is either being a pet or a peon8. newer alliances have no chance @ sov stuff in 0.0 and are limited to roams only thanks to napsthen again what am i saying, people cant understand a simple thread how can they understand how to play an mmo which includes pvp you know? looks like theres more of that in empire than in 0.0 until the next max campaign i guess"
6/23/2010,nice quote and then delete everything he said and put my own words in there bro.
6/23/2010,"i completely support making systems more expensive exponentially so smaller alliances can move in dirt free, this however will only make larger alliances drop their visible in game holdings. they will still lay a claim to the systems around them even without sov. a lot of systems in 0.0 are unclaimed but if you move into many of them you will find yourself dogpiled by all your new neighbors who are none to happy about your little incursion. the real trick is to make each 0.0 system potentially very profitable for the alliance so they do not need vast tracts of space but at the same time make the scale enough that 10 people cannot get the same profit out of a system that 5000 can. as it stands each system can support maybe four or five people actively npcing assuming none of them use caps, supercaps, or dual box. or a mechanic that makes it beneficial to have unaffiliated entities nearby.your base reasons are not flawed, just your methodology."
6/23/2010,1
6/23/2010,"have not had so many problems with this specific issue, lately, but yes: easier on the eyes would be nice.glitches like the ""solar system map station dropdown interface"" showing whenever you open, close and re-open the probing interface (without closing the scanner panel) need to be fixed as well."
6/23/2010,"yes! my main disappointment with t3 cruisers was that they basically do exactly the same as other ships of that race, i want ecm legions and long range webbing tengus etc. it would be awesome."
6/23/2010,okay.
6/23/2010,"there are so many issues like this with eve ui. and they put new ones in with each expansion. seriously ccp it's not funny anymore. ok, it's a little bit funny."
6/23/2010,"what you smocking, cos i really need to get some of that...hi anna, i missed you so, your random incoherent and very poorly constructed arguments bring a tear to the eyes.ganking is more expesnive, particularly tempests and typhoons, sure it is still done, but the threshold value for people to successfully gank someone and still profit has risen. i agree more people have adapted and moved to the approach of multiple suicide thrashers instead. this is a good tactic because you are not losing much isk but still getting bang for your buck. this however increases the number of characters needed to successfully gank and as a result decreases the amount of profit per person or per character depending. which overall leads to the increased barrier to entry and resulting costs of a successful suicide gank increasing. hardly any freighters are getting touched these days, and the only suicide wrecks i have seen lately are elite frigates (i presume buzzards with bpos)"
6/23/2010,"very true furb, sorry i just glanced over your comment.it is true ship prices will just keep going down until they adjust to the new insurance prices.but, this trend is not sustainable, there will eventually come a time when the supply of ships will actually equal the demand (ccp's goal in my opinion) it's just that the supply is so saturated compared to demand that ships and resulting mineral prices are falling out of their ass. eventually an equilibrium will be reached where prices have stabilised. at this point, the price of suiganking will be equal to the insurance cover cost of the ship and no-less.if ship prices do get so low as to enable ier to return, ccp is gonna hit the 'i win' button and reset prices to fall even lower."
6/23/2010,"so you want more wardec, more pirate, destroy the market. i could go on but thats the consequences i see plus the ones you've told. on top of that, security status hasn't changed so you get a gcc with what you told (i blame you cause of your wall of text if i'm wrong)...thats why most carebears and people that live in high-sec won't pvp in low sec btw.also, they are more and better things to do to change the current market situation...if all or most of market transactions happens in jita is a problem to you. for example, increase the taxes of sell orders and buy orders in jita. well a system that has more traffic in transactions up to a point that you lose isk if you make a transaction in a high traffic system...thats itfor low sec and more pvp thing you said well thats a bit more complicated but your situation would increase, pirates, blobs and most pvp'ers from what they told me, don't like blobs at all.no, not supported at all. you just told the major deficiencies in your own idea at least."
6/23/2010,"where do i start .... pardon me if if this may appear rude, no offense is meant but i can only repeat myself so many times before losing my cool main points:1- you are deliberately putting the geographically challenged factions at a massive disadvantage.2- you are deliberately putting the smaller factions at a massive disadvantage.3- you are not addressing the problem of solo-frigates taking everything in sight with a blob as backup.4- you are rewarding timezone warfare even more than what the broken dt spawn mechanic does.explanations:1- some areas have bottlenecks that are downright godsends compared to rival territories and not all militias have the same base number of systems.2- one frig in all first tier plexes with blob lingering nearby, move to tier 2 etc. -> war over in a single downtime tops. blob = bad, 'nuff said.3- see two. basing the system on a reporting system will not help this. if you have ever been in 0.0 and seen the ludicrous spam you get when the space you live in is invaded you would find another solution the initial swarm of frigs will spam system so hard that the defending side will ignore it in short order .. numbers > all = bad mechanic.4- i just need one timezone with a blob and a handful of hard-liners during the day to perform delaying operations and i can hold all space permanently with your rules. post-dt mechanic is bad, but replacing it with something worse does not help.for fw to have a chance the plexing mechanic itself has to be revised, pvp engagements of all sizes must have an impact on occupancy, missions must be included in occupancy and made harder so solo-bombers/farmers are excluded and rewards must benefit participants primarily and not the horde of alts that is dragged along for the ride.no support."
6/23/2010,"this is more a features and ideas discussion than an assembly hall issue.i'd suggest to move it to f&i, where the devs will see it. csm doesn't have the role of telling ccp how to fix things, just that things are broken.faction warfare is already on the agenda for the imminent meetings in iceland.30 minutes is not really enough time to mobilize forces: the proposed system ensures that folks running alarm clock ops have a strategic (if not tactical) advantage.i do like the basic idea though, and i personally would like to see it expanded to sovereignty in general, with faction warfare being focussed on npc sovereignty claims while null sec ""faction warfare"" serves to spread null sec sov fights over multiple simultaneous targets, thus giving fcs a reason to split fleets up."
6/23/2010,yes.
6/23/2010,"withdrawing from a wardecced alliance in order to protect a pos is on the same scale of foolishness as waging a hisec wardec with neutral rr.wardec mechanism needs to be fixed in order to give the declaring party some goal to meet, after which the wardec is retracted. the goal could be ""remove pos at system iv moon 3"" or simply ""inflict 1b isk damage."" there should be penalties for not achieving the goal, such as a wardec collateral being required, which is not refunded if the wardec fails.to date i've only seen wardecs used by people looking for easy kills, usually folks who will not log in until their neutral rr is online and have intel on how many wts are logged in.flag rr so they can't dock after repping, or simply resort to concord intervention when a neutral party reps any target involved in a wardec.preventing pos holders from leaving a wardec has to have a trade off that impacts on the wardeccing party."
6/23/2010,"the tldr was a joke, i hope you actually read what i had to say. (now with improved formatting for 50% less headache!)"
6/23/2010,"what it says on the box. sometimes i want to view the info box for an item or see the preview for a ship that's not available in the market or contracts. typing a name in the chat box and autolinking it is very cumbersome, especially if you do not know the exact spelling and even then it does not always work (try last year's alliance tournament prize ships for example)."
6/23/2010,"ccp should rather fix the stupid inconsistency with the linking of items. i already reported a few bugs. e.g. about items that were shown as variation for an item in the show info dialog but you couldnt search for contracts on those?then all those items might show up in the item database on the eve wiki aswell. and given we got a decent in game browser, you could use that database instead of creating a new ui just for that. :)just a thought."
6/23/2010,not a bad idea despite the tears i sense lurking just under the surface.
6/23/2010,"that's not an argument against frigs per se, more an argument against podding/risky pvp in general. i could say the same about 500 million implants."
6/23/2010,"so wait, if ank is so hated, how did (s)he get elected?"
6/23/2010,"trolls, trolls everywhere."
6/23/2010,"a lot of folks talked from high atop the soap box about ending nap and blobs, thereby alleviating lag and increasing enjoyable pvp in null space. sadly, this has given way to ""well i'm not going to be the first ceo to break the nap..."" think of it realistically. the nap essentially cements borders as they stand. nobody who could potentially loose space is going to want to break it, and nobody who would remain in the same space wants to break it either (unless they just enjoy wars of attrition - some do). that really just leaves those who could gain territory from broken naps, which is a really small segment of the null population. given the fact that most of the high/low sec population have no feelings either way (and would probably suggest their issues were more important), you're looking at a rather large establishment to tumble with minimal support.unless you get serious defection from the nap's north and south, nothing is going to change since the first to drop will probably just get dog-piled. essentially, every established alliance is scared to death that it might loose, and isn't willing to risk it."
6/24/2010,page 7 is simply not acceptable for an idea of this quality.
6/24/2010,"supported,"
6/24/2010,"a redesign of an old mechanic to something new and shiny and engaging would be totally marketable.say for example mining or missioning, for me both systems are boring and old-fashioned, if they'd just totally redesigned those with co-op in mind that would be really easily marketed, and it would be new content and a fix in one :)in general i support this drive for excellence especially when it comes to the ui, which was for me personally the biggest thing to overcome to play eve. i tried this game before like years ago and ran away screaming because of the ui."
6/24/2010,"i don't know. if we got this:new in this expansion:1: bounty hunting as a usable profession. on behalf of the vengeful and rich, track down the most dangerous prey in the far corners of space.2: t3 frigates open up the field for all kinds of new tactics, as you create exactly the ship you need.3: new epic arcs expand the possibilities in blood raider, sansha or serpentis space.4: a fully revamped ui makes space combat as smooth as the click of a mouse.5: total pve reworking. face smart, dynamic npc's and missions that adapt to your strengths and never give you the same challenge twice.6: epic fleet fights become more practical with fixes to lag.none of those would attract new players? all of this is simply finishing existing content."
6/24/2010,"i'd like to see less quality features then more half or unfinished features. on the one side it's cool that ccp is adding new content over and over, but on the other... if it's bugged or feels unfinished - what's the point?personally i really won't mind half less frequency of expansion releases, but twice more well-rounded expansion. yes we can say that eve won't be growing up that fast, but isn't it good enough game already to not recklessly add half-features?"
6/24/2010,"5th quarter check-in, thread was on the first page of the assembly hall before i posted this drivel.and oh hey, not a single acknowledgment from ccp that they've seen this thread, after 15 months of bouncing around this forum."

6/24/2010,"as a cross trainer from caldari ships to gallente ships, i was forced to train blasters and railguns as well.everything was nice and sweet, but when i reached the marauder type class: kronos, i started to pvp with the kronos on the test server.the fitting was good looking and with potential on the fitting screen.but, out on the field, things changed...encoutering an autocannon user which shoots aprox 6.000 damage per salvo at every range he was, and i barely hitted him for aprox 1.500 damage per salvo at over 10km, made me think it was something wrong with my fitting.but i see it was not.so: please fix blasters !!!losing ships on tranquility just because the blasters, it's not pvp, it's slaughter.thank you"
6/24/2010,definitely supported. the field commands are lagging behind quite badly these days.
6/24/2010,"catalyst does not have enough powergrid to fit full-rack of 150 mm rails.. now, if i add two rigs that boots their power useage by 10% each, and it stacks, and put a couple plates and an mwd on, i wonder what will happen......"

6/24/2010,10 million m3 is the size of a titans sma. isn't that a bit excessive?
6/24/2010,"not supported!if you eliminate one skill that is fundamental, then you open the debate to eliminate other skills. there is nothing wrong with learning skills, what's wrong is that people who lack patience and want to speed up everything, to an unreasonable point, that is dangerous, because it does approach the ""instant gratification"" vs ""hard work/patience"" equation."
6/24/2010,"skills for a new player is already annoying every shiny toy you see requires ages to train.adding more salt to the injury with these 'learning skills' is just giving extra reasons to quit this game. the only thing it does is create a 4-5m sp time-sink. 10k% faster is too fast, 200 or 400 would do just fine as well. signed."
6/24/2010,not supportedthe only thing worse than this idea would be if ccp decided to let people buy sp.
6/24/2010,well ccp is putting in a function that allows you to take your tasty tasty stem cell sp that they are introducing and spending it on whatever come this coming tuesday.../thread?
6/24/2010,"i'm strongly against them removing learning skills, as much as it sucks, i'm playing by thoses rules. i'm like 3 months old, i spent almost all my game time learning learning skills because i know i'm going to play this game for a long time, i'm alrdy penalizing myself (willingly, and i don't complain about it) for doing that, i would get penalized even more. why should i pay twice the price for taking that decision, because some of you guys decided not to learn thoses skills and regret it ? and the other kind of people are thoses that are so old that just don't care...even if they were to redistribute the points it's still stupid and i'm still behind, because while you got thoses skills alrdy and used them to make tons of isk or survive in pvp, or whatever you did with them, i didn't have them... so returning me thoses points is totally pointless to me... totally. how are you gonna give me back thoses 2 months were i didn't have thoses improved skills to make **** loads of isk ? you won't.i decided to learn learning skills because they give me an edge at some point, i do not want it to be taken away, and be penalized... so not only people had an edge on me during all that time, but they get back at equal footing. so in short, i put an insane effort to learn almost only learning skills for 3 months for nothing.so i hope this new system is just for downtime points gift, and not to remove learnings. or if they do remove learning, even if they give me back thoses sp, that will not be enought, to pay my loss back. my character spent hours and hours injecting learning datas in his brain, he is supposed to be more advanced to learn things, you can't tell me that never took place.again i understand how painful the learning system skill is, for new players, i do. but if you do remove them, you penalize some of us. especially me, who basicly never beneificed a single day of having thoses level 5... somebody who got thoses level 5 for years years, made ****loads of sp...i'm totally against this, i hope this is just a rumor... i'm all about not having learning skills, but only if this is done without penazling anyone, and this can't be done.i certainly did not spend 2month and half in learning skill to have an edge in my learning curve for 2 days, that doesn't make any sense...who would do that ? you would have to be out of your mind..."
6/24/2010,"totally supported. the learning skills are just time sink which only benefit older players. expensive implants give vets a decent enough sp/hour advantage over newbies. i started an alt last year with power of 2, and re-experiencing the learning grind was the most hideous thing i've ever done. not even worth undocking for over a month. tangfastic. also, i don't see why anyone would argue against getting a) a stat boost (since so few people have all 5's, this system means everyone will be training faster than before) and b) being able to sink over a million (t1 to 5, t2 to 4) sp wherever we want. who ever was *****ing about ccp not giving game time back needs to stfu. you get the sp back with interest tbh. the benefit of having 'free sp' would be great for everyone, and in fact even more so for vets, because we know which skills are the most subjectively valuable to us. no-one looses with this system. everyone retains the same total sp and the suggested loss of game time is a total non-issue. yes, if you have all learning to 5, then you might have lost some gametime, but only if you are still waiting to break even on them, in which case you will be no more behind than you are now. if you only took t2 skills to 4 more than maybe 90 days ago you are gaining time. tl:dr...pros :everyone trains everything faster. good for newbs, good for vets. everyone who had trained any learning keeps the sp and can put it anywhere. is there anyone who wouldn't like an extra mil sp in something ? cons : the all 5 chars gain least, but only if they haven't broken even on sp yet, and even then it only matters if you are very narrow minded. the benefits they got by being the first people to build or invent or fly a new whatever won't have vanished."
6/24/2010,"it's not all about how many sp you have... obviously no one loosing in skill points...but my character is totally screwed.i spent 2 months and half, with not a single usefull skill, because i learned a lot of level 5. this whole skill thing, is all about planning, why do you think remap is 12months ? because it is a tight and long planning process... a slight changement in how things works change everything.how do you expect me to break even ? i'm 3 month old. i'm years away to break even...so no i don't qualify to thoses ""no one"".i remain the same sp yes but as of today.... my game plan is based over years, knowing i'll be slightly ahead 95% of the people in sp, grinding and grinding, until finally i break even, and get ahead. that's thoses points that i'm loosing. and that's how i mentally hold on 3months having **** skills...you are obviously quite far from a correct reasoning there..."
6/24/2010,"^this.and.. i love that message that eve will wrench your heart if you're a min/maxer .eve is fraught with conflict and the internal conflict is part of it.newbies need to quickly get over the warped concept that this game is about leveling up or that bigger ships are better.its not about how you stack up to others but what you can contribute, and unlike most mmo's where a new player is worthless ...not even worth 1/10th a person, here if employed correctly you're worth well over 50% of a max skilled person quickly (scout...tackle, prober, basic electronic warfare in a blackbird, ) you can be an important help to a corp at war in a t1-frigate that you can fly ok in about a week. true, its harder to get involved in 0.0 with low sp but there is lots else to the game.i'd feel a bit bad for the noobs but the accelerated first 1.6 million get you up quickly..as do the way skills are construed with the first 80 percent taking 20% of the learning time. if they wanted to further ease the burden for new players they could allow the training of the second tier learning skills with the first at lvl 3 not 4."
6/24/2010,"it was your choice to train only learning. what most people do is train the skills they need as they appear, and fill in with learning in the mean time. your first day in a new game and you decided to sit in station and do nothing for a month :s ? that's your problem buddy.most everyone gets their learning skills slowly, not maxing them until its worth doing so. you can get 8 points for each attribute from learning in just over a week with the 100% training speed. imagine you are playing another popular mmo, involving bringing doom to elves and goblins. and you decide to go and pick herbs for two months. would you be complaining at the end that you didn't have any non-herb skills ? if you want balanced skills, then you have to train them in a balanced manner. if you have this massive skill plan, why didn't you just hit up evemon, toss in the skills you want and ask it to tell you which learning skills were worth training (ie would pay in the duration of the plan)"
6/24/2010,"i have to agree with this!eve isn't really about skill points... its about the ship you fly... have a good ship and fitting before you leave the dock and you'll be fine... sure you have to learn the skills in some or many cases but what you bring to the table at the time of a fight is what matters!noobs (forgive the word), are still going to be ok... this change isn't a big deal! i still believe there can be more to offer for noobs but ccp already provided you with a lot more than i ever had when i first started back in 2006! i'm still learning the game myself (i don't beleve there is a person who 100% knows eve) and well... baby steps... take the game a bit at a time before you go out to fight. besides i can't blame anyone who wants to make this change... its getting people high level mining faster and high level fighting faster etc!vets, your more than ok here... gives you more people to shoot (chuckles)"
6/24/2010,"katarlia simov: who is whinning ? ""learning skills are too hard, they sucks, they are useless plz remove them, /whine /whine""... who is whining there ?it's ppl who request that learning skills are removed for years and years that are the whinners... your comparison doesn't even make any sense, plz get some sense in what you are saying... go back to wow... you are not on the right forum...>>anyway i don't care to what they are gonna do, they have probably taken their decision if it's even true. just don't insult me, by telling nobody will be penalized, that's a lie, and is a totally poor and wrong reasoning. now they do what they have to do, and i know what will be the consequences to my character and many others, if you think i spent 3months doing that without a tiny little bit of inner will, and that i'm gonna start crying because you flame me, you are surely mistaken. i'm out of here."
6/24/2010,i've spent over 2 billion isk on improved learning implants (+5's) for many alts.how will ccp deal with people who now have learning implants that will soon train nothing?
6/24/2010,"ccp say they want to remove learning skills... did you even read the op ? you sir, are the one whining. basically you are saying that you didn't get much mileage out of your first couple of months because you maxed learning. but you didn't have to train it, and certainly you didn't need to put it to 5. the comparison is to illustrate that maxing one skill group always comes at the expense of another. yes, they are useful in their own ways, but they won't let you actually go kill stuff (ie playing the main content of the game).also, i've been in eve since just before exodus, never played wow, although i did spend some time playing tabras and cov. just fyi really... edit - im not insulting you, i'm telling you that, on a factual level, you will not be penalized in the sense that you will be in the same or better position after the changes than before. it was your choice to waste your first few months in eve doing nothing, and equally you could have neglected learning to put all you frigate skills to level 5 and it would be equally wasted. no-one forced you to sit in station and do nothing. you chose to. you can run the rookie missions in an ibis, then the level 1s without actually training any further skills than you get at generation. the only way that game time is wasted in eve is if you choose to do nothing. also, loling at your inner will. stomping off when you don't win an argument is a wonderful way to demonstrate that."
6/24/2010,the implants are attribute enchancers.. so they improve your sttributes and not the learning skills.
6/24/2010,"i would support any measure to remove learning skills, they are nothing more than a barrier to new players joining."
6/24/2010,not supported.there is no problem to require a solution. learning skills have brought many people into the game and i have never once seen anyone one put off by them. quite to the contrary. i wont support any dumbing down of eve online.
6/24/2010,"fitz please tell me that was a troll.and for you people that are saying not supported. once again let me reiterate. this is going to happen! ccp said it is going to once they can figure out how to do it properly. its not a we want something to happen thread. its a we know you are doing it and this is how we want you to do it thread. you saying not supported and then *****ing about how it does x or y, ccp doesnt care that it does those things. and tbh they need to be taken out. my main started with mining five and industry five and cald frigate three when i made him a miner 2.5 years back. my alt started with 1's everywhere and a whole 5k sp or whatever. was worthless pile of crap for first two months or whatever until he got to the rank one level five rank 3 level four like i bet 70 percent or more of the game has them trained to. ccp doesnt want people going this is **** and quitting after a month of not being able to do ****. and if you are going to call stuff dumbing down the game taking out learning skills isnt where i would start. start at something like the time it took to use bombs a couple of patches ago vs now. (10 day or so difference.)"
6/24/2010,it is not going to happen. ccp were considering it but now consider it impossible due to the fact most people want to keep them.
6/24/2010,i support this purely because learning skills are pointless and act as a time sink.
6/24/2010,"i think that learning skills should be removed as well but with a few differences from the op. instead of just a permanent +10 and 10% to all attributes it should be a +8/+9 that is redistributable through remaps.how it would work is all players would be given a boost to there attributes and the next time they remap their attributes those new point would be redistributable. this would mean that the max attribute allowed when remapping would have to be raised so that final attribute levels are the same as now.currently the max any character can get is 33 (15 base + 10 skills + 5 implant + 10%) on a primary attribute and 24.4(9 base + 10 skills + 5 implant + 10%) on a secondary. my idea is to change the max allowed level of one attribute to be 28 (28 + 5 implant = 33) and the max for the rest be 20 (20 + 5 implant = 25).this would result in the being able to maintain the highest sp gain currently available while also allowing for remapping to target more than one skill group. even with adding +8 to all attributes and pushing two to the max (28 and 20) there would still be 16 points left over to distribute. this means you could have (assuming all +5 implants) 33 in one attribute, 25 in two others and the last two have 6 and 5.also to all the people who say that nobody is forced to train learning skills and all those arguments: it doesn't matter! the simple fact is that a large enough percentage of newer players are not staying with eve because of things like learning skills. they are also unnecessary. skills are a secondary effect for the game, they add to a players ability to play the game to their liking by increasing their ability to make things explode/build things/mine things etc. learning skills are a tertiary effect, they increase a players ability to increase their ability to play the game to their liking. they are not necessary to play the game so why have them?"
6/24/2010,do not support.training them is not that big of a deal and i for one did not wait to have them trained to have fun.
6/24/2010,do not support!!i love the learning skills.always remember: caps lock is the cruise control for cool.
6/24/2010,"yes, please, can we have folders back?"
6/24/2010,"summaryallow an option, governed by a role, that when creating a bookmark it can be made ""for corp"" and thereby accessible by all members of a corporation.-----introductionover the past few months, ccp has been implementing a number of welcome changes which improve in-game corp communication. however, there is one area which, to this point, has not received much attention despite being an item used everyday. this item is bookmarks. the problemwhenever a bookmark is created, it is limited to the creator of that bookmark unless transferred to someone else. while this is generally not a problem for a small group of players, when this expands to a corporate level, it's a nightmare. for example, on any given day in my wh based corporation, we can have between 4 and 40 bookmarks that must be distributed amongst all members. the click and drag process falls flat here as bookmarks can only be returned 5 at a time, and human error means that bookmarks occasionally get missed, something that can be catastrophic to any operation. this also means, because every player must do this separately, a great strain on the eve servers, as it is repeated amongst every corporation operating in a similar manner.in more known space based corps, the main use of bookmarks seems to be tactical ones. this presents an issue, as all new members must individually make there own bookmarks or go through a similar process to wormholes of transferring the bookmarks to their people and places, then moving them back for the next new recruit.if bookmarks are to be transferred via copies, this relies fairly heavily on the owner of those bookmarks getting somewhere to hand them out. this can be prevented by disconnects, crashes, other players or real life, and can be extremely detrimental to the corp operations.the solutionthe easiest way to fix this is to create an option for bookmarking that allows it to be accessed by all corporation members. a folder, like the default ""agents"" folder, titled ""corporation bookmarks"" would be added to people and places. bookmarks could either be dragged here or, when created, a checkbox ""make available for corp"" would be checked and accomplish the same thing. to avoid abuse, both access to and creation of said bookmarks would be governed by a role. benefitsno more handing out bookmarks individuallyevery corp member has the same set of bookmarksless server load due to not having to load a hangar full of bookmarksstreamlining of corp operationsconclusionthis is a simple and easy fix to an issue that's plagued eve since players decided they wanted to coordinate their movements to things not immediately right-clickable."
6/24/2010,yes please.
6/24/2010,love the idea.of course... spies would love it even better... :(
6/24/2010,i suport
6/24/2010,oh please gawd yes!
6/24/2010,most definitely.i included this in my list of top problems with wormhole life. would make a huge positive difference in the day to day life of all wormhole dwellers
6/24/2010,bookmarks needs redesigning.
6/24/2010,great idea if implemented well.
6/24/2010,"the thing about huge nap's is, everyone can agree in principle that they're kind of dull, but the first alliance to drop theirs will be crushed by the ones that don't. people do this because it is necessary. the only way to get smaller groups is for game mechanics to reward them."
6/24/2010,most of the problems are becuase you can cross enitire galaxy with entire fleet in no time no cost and no risk to your teritory .this is blob and nap firendly and it is how you ending with the current 0.0 affairs.
6/24/2010,"three powerblocks give enough room for interesting wars. what is needed is more fluid warfare between the blocks. so no blob vs blob anymore, to achieve this eve needs to give space between a and b more meaning. so if you as a fleet know where the enemy is, you go around them, and strike them where their defenses are light. what this also should mean is that these fleets should also be able to do meaningful damage behind the lines. if it takes 24hours to take something down it gives the enemy blob enough time to respond, resulting in blob vs blob again.right now going 'around' an enemy is impossible, since there are enough gameplay mechanics to let you travel large distances as a group. as long as this is easy to do, there will be blob vs blob fight. simple answer why people blob.. is because the can. if they are forced to guard their territory over a wider front where distance actually matters it will become a different game."
6/24/2010,"firstly, the client has little problem updating several parameters for hundreds of objects (that are firing at each other) in real time. granted, the current state of performance is considerably worse than what we know the game to be capable of (i've seen lagless fights with hundreds in local and mostly on grid).secondly, to reduce server strain the auto scanner only has to look for a subset of objects within the star system: say, piloted ships, or anything with a warp drive that is player controlled. there's simply no need for it to look at anything else.ccp devs rejected simple automation of the current directional scanner while talking of the need for some replacement mechanic for a delayed local. please come up with a new reason to diss these ideas, your current one doesn't work."

6/24/2010,"you do realize that there are many 0.5 systems that are not on the border? also, 0.5 is highsec - get over it.your gameplay should adapt to the game, not the game to your gameplay."
6/24/2010,man you people get really upset over this idea. its kind of cute to watch the alt posters coming out of the wood works to defend their precious carebear empires. i want to point out that since insurance prices are now directly related to mineral prices bs have been plummeting and for the cost of one pre tyrranis bs i can now buy 2-3 depending on the bs. happy suicide ganking for all ^_^
6/24/2010,"well... seems my yesterday's post disappeared, but i'm stubborn and i will write it again. and again if i will have to.why don't make upgradeable cc's via isk? for example, you buy basic cc, place it on planet, then if you got skill high enough, you can use upgrade button with isk cost equal to next one cc lvl. and you can upgrade such basic cc up to max lvl. since ccs are seeded by npcs they won't protest that less people buy one cc and upgrade than buying standard and later on improved, advanced and elite."

6/24/2010,what is the issue with making wh space a viable part of the game.several issues that have been raised in the past seem to be over looked.e.g- sov wh space still can not be sovd.the t3 market is ccp manipulating the market?im a t3 ship builder and its insane.the cost of melted nano ribbons with the c320 and c540 is damned near the cost of what a t3 ship sells for on the market not to mention all the the materials and time invested in the extremly compicated process to build a t3 ship.i find it hard to believe that t3 ship builders areselling the ship hulls for less than they can sell the materials used to build the ships.the skill needed and the time invested in building these ships is insurmountable.please can we address this issue?i understand why ccp would be supplying the market as the skills required to be a t3 ship builder scared virtually everyone away and not to mention wh space has been glossed over.and any player who actually trained the t3 ship skills would have to have been a long term player in game and would realize that they were not making a profit.maybe ccp could make the materials to build the ships more accessable?thanks for your time.
6/24/2010,"after reading that i think its unlikely we will not be able to find any common ground. i think many people in fw are falling into one of two camps. those who want more npcs so frigates cant take larger plexes and those who want to do away with the npcs and make occupancy a soley pvp activity. the more i see this split the more i think we may want to make 2 faction wars. one in high sec where you can do plexes like they are currently set up and missions and other pve activities for occupancy. the other could be in low sec where occupancy is based on pvp. the current occupancy system where pvp and pve are supposed to go hand in hand is a failure. blame the players if you want, but very few people want to do that. if players dont want to play the occupancy game then its a failure and its time to redo it.as far as your critique of the ops proposal i think either you or i do not understand the proposal. because, as i see it, none of the negatives you give the plan apply. @ blobs: if an enemy blob sits in one corner of the map doing plexes thats fine you can just go to all the other parts of the fw map and run plexes. all the systems will have cps to run unless they are in the 8 hour cool down. there are like 70 systems per front. the side that chooses to split up will get more plexes than the side that chooses to blob. blobbing would definitely not be the way to win this war. instead this war would be won by strategically placing the minimum amount of pilots at key locations in order to secure them. just like in real wars if you commit resources to one battle/area you may regret not having them for a battle somewhere else. also if we include the resetting counter idea then the side that chooses to stay and fight will get more than the side that runs every time someone comes in. hence neither blobbing nor hide and seek plexing will be the optimal way to plex here.@ alarm clock ops: first) i dont see the rewards justifying this. if people want to wake up in the middle of the night to gain an extra 5% lp bonus, well what can i say give it to them. i will continue to play casually and not sweat it.second) the war is constant. there will be constant cps popping up though out the day after the cooldown. so no time zone will have any advantage. if by some very slight chance all of them do tend to pop up at the same times then they can make adjustments to fix this easily. for example they could say no cp1 will spawn within <U+FFFD> hour of another spawning. again here one thing you should keep in mind is this war does not end until one side stops fighting. one side may have all the systems but that just means the other side will be able to run control points in all of the systems until they get one back. @ intel channel= spam: the intel of the cps/plexes being taken will not be posted in militia they will be posted in a different channel entirely. there will be one channel for the cald gallente front and one for the amarr minmatar front. that way if you are in one of the front you can just close the intel channel for the other front. but the short information [12:07] kamela; major; amarr;cearain battle cruiser should only take about one line even with the window is pretty narrow. so you can have about 30 of these on one page with a narrow window. if you widen the window you can likely have about 500 of these messages on one page. lets face it, if we get that many people running plexes at one time on one front this will be a huge success. if it ends up like that it will indeed be time for ccp to expand the fw idea into other fronts like pirate factions. but for now the occupancy mechanism is a complete failure so why expand a failed idea."
6/24/2010,"here's my proposal and the problem it is meant to partially address.proposal: given its history of futility, ccp should stop introducing surprise 'features' that nobody asked for and that are completely at-odds with the harsh essence of eve like the ez-mode buying sp (or perhaps swapping-out sp) option they are now threatening us with. the development pipeline must include a mandatory consultation with players before new game-breaking changes are decided upon.problem:ccp has demonstrated time and again that they aren't very good (to put it mildly) at developing or maintaining an internet spaceships game built on a sandbox-philosophy. they lack both the wisdom to differentiate between good changes and game-breaking changes and the competence to properly implement whatever changes they end up (seemingly arbitrarily) deciding on. think fw, or an economy that for months was built entirely around self-destructing battleships for profit, or the npc pi market debacle, or the significant increase in lag that recent expansions have brought with them, or the unpunished pl 'not in local' haxx, or the rampant macro-miners and macro-ratters, or the deep-safe nerf that is alleged to have succeeded at nothing but breaking the ability to safely log in any safe or the recent downtime.eve is a sandbox game. its harshness, complexity, steep learning curve, and the time sink required to gain proficiency in it are what make the game great. ccp's recent expansions and future plans seem at odds with each of these virtues. instead of focusing on fixing the myriad of bugs, banning the bots, and avoiding colossal blunders that give players risk-free windfall profits running to the tens of billions of isk, they seem determined to make new eden friendlier, easier, and more appealing to the masses, who (they imagine) clamor for ez mode, farmville and spacebook.ccp, we love eve because it's hard, not because it's easy. we wish you'd stop breaking it. yes, this game has a huge tank, but it's a buffer tank and your dps is unrelenting. if you keep trying to attract the wow hordes at the risk of alienating your player base by introducing broken fluff after broken fluff while letting bugs fester for years, you will ultimately succeed only in the latter."
6/24/2010,"the inference being that you enjoy poorly developed and maintained games built on a sandbox-philosophy enough to maintain an account? honestly, leading a proposal off with ""ccp sucks at their collective job"" is a lack of appreciation for the anthropic principle that brought you to post. but i digress -i am more than willing to be wrong on this one - where's the ""buy sp"" page? i don't think there is one, and instrumenting sp grants, which might be an excellent way to appologize for blown downtime estimates in the future, does not an ez mode make. in short, what the frak are you talking about?m"

6/24/2010,it would be helpful to know when someone is headed out the door.
6/24/2010,"directors don't get leaving notice, so they probably shouldn't get about-to-leave notice either. still, not a bad idea."
6/24/2010,"okay, as we all know bringing a new player into a l4 mission only serves to entice them to join your corp or to keep them interested in the game with something to look forward to. i suggest that we make it more rewarding for a new player by: making bounties increased for players that put a warp scrambler (2x extra?) or disruptor (1.5x extra?) on a rat.this would teach new players how to tackle and fit for tackling, how to maintain transversal for pvp, and maybe desensitize them to losing ships by having target switching when rats get scrambled. who knows maybe they might enjoy tackling and be able and willing at the next roam.i doubt it would be abused by solo mission runners since mid slots couldn't really be sacrificed for tackle. multiboxers wouldn't gain much either since it would be kinda difficult to manage aggro, dps, and your tackling.thoughts?"
6/24/2010,"i dont think its a good idea. for a lot of ships, it is not exactly difficult to sacrifice a cap recharger for a scrambler. you just lose a small amount of tank, for what effectively is doubled income. l4 missions already pays great and this effective uber-buff is not necessary. plus, one cannot learn pvp from turning on a scrambler on a rat bs."
6/24/2010,"you've seriously never thought people triple boxed pvp? i do not see how this would be any harder. no way. this won't do anything but assure mission runners fit points. also if a person wants to learn to tackle, why not just have them actually tackle something useful? like a hostile ship? funny thing about players vs npc. players dont just burn at you and orbit."
6/24/2010,"i dont know why ccp is making peoples life difficult when it comes to this, but used crystals when fitted on a ship prevents people from contracting said ship to other people.this includes lasers and mining lasersat the very least ccp, allow people to remove crystals without having to be at the ship physically."
6/24/2010,"or at the very least, just allow a ""these crystals are damaged, do you still want to accept the contract y/n"" dialogue"
6/24/2010,"the ability to fit lasers is not restricted to amarr, nor is the ability to fit crystals to t2 strips on mining barges and exhumers.aside from that, the idea is sound and i support it. in general, we be able to unload ammo and cargo from ships remotely./signed"
6/24/2010,forgot about mining crystals.. ill fix it :)
6/24/2010,"how about this, the process period of a pilot/corporation leaving a corp/alliance in the following equation*pilot/corp time spent with corp/alliance is t*factor of 10% is called k*when leaving a corp/alliance, the cooldown is ll = t.kexception: the corp/alliance votes on kicking the said pilot/corporation, then this process defaults to 24 or 48 hours. the longer you are in a corp the harder it is to just pack up and leave, unless the said entity is kicking you for whatever reasons they deem fit."
6/24/2010,some people have been in my corp for two years... it will take them two and a half months to leave? where is sense in that?
6/24/2010,supported. make it a week
6/24/2010,"i don't really see what the problem is. if they drop an alliance to protect a tower, then one must assume they will be joining one when the smoke has ""cleared"" .. petition the corporation for alliance hopping and let the gms slap them around a bit.or is it no longer considered circumventing the roe and an exploit by ccp?"
6/24/2010,hoping this was serious post.this change would not help much anything. just logoff your gatecamping toon and put alt scout in neighbouring (is that a word english plox) system and log your real toon on only when target is jumping or something if it bothers you so much tbh.because there's no real alternative for lame alt scouts we got to live with them as it is. this belongs to category should have been made better 2003 but ccp cba to do it.
6/24/2010,"i'm considering putting forth an actual proposal, but wanted some feedback first. the limitation of cargo type in assembled ships' holds during storage in the maintenance bay seems inelegant and arbitrary to me. while there are already mechanical inelegancies in eve (""do not put this box in that larger box, you can't know what will happen!""), this one actually gets on my nerves a bit. if assembled ships' cargoes were unrestricted, what would the world look like, and would we like it better?[1] how much of an actual cargo buff to the ship would it be? to the best of my knowledge, you can't get 2 assembled industrials into an orca. that means an ittyv, so ~40km3. is this math right? if so, that's a what, ~25% increase?[2] with fully cargo'd ships available, what game styles change? does this help or hurt miners? pirates? industrialists?[3] is there some technical limitation that the current behavior is meant to mask, and it needs to work as currently implemented?[4] is the limitation strictly for keeping overall m3 balance with other existing hulls?commentary appreciated.perspective disclosure: i own an orca, can fly industrial v, can't fly freighter, can't fly rorqual."
6/24/2010,"it might be an item database issue. not 100% sure, it's just a logical stab in the dark."
6/24/2010,"it was a nerf to carriers, back in 2007. rorquals didn't exist, jump freighters didn't exist, and titans were extraordinarily rare, so 0.0 logistics worked primarily through carriers and dreads. cargo-fit dreads existed, but the more common play was to stick haulers and barges filled with mineral-compression items into carrier's smas(back when small tractors compressed mins 96:1), and use that to haul multiple capitals worth of minerals per load. they decided that carriers were too good, so they proposed a suite of nerfs. mineral compression items got nerfed, ships in smas became unable to carry anything but ammo, and there was a proposal to make it so that carriers could only run 5 drones themselves and would have to assign the rest to other ships, though thankfully that one got overturned by player rage. but yeah, the restriction exists for a reason. not a perfect reason, and one that's somewhat obsolete nowadays, but that's why. might be worth revisiting it, though."

6/25/2010,"just gonna take a moment to interject here,destroyers are really good t1 ships. i can take a catalyst and wipe the floor of any basic t1 frig and take on most faction level frigs no problem. hell, i've easily popped the unweary, first assult stealth bomber and intercepter who thought that they were gettting froggy.so as a t1 hull, as they exist now, are just fine and do a really really good job at what they are supposed to be doing. but thats the problem, its only a t1 hull.now, the problem is everyone is trying to make them usable and viable in a world filled with assult ships and cruisers on the battle field. interdictors are very niche and they do worse at handling frigs than their t1 counterparts.the solution is not to make these great t1 hulls even stronger, its to finally push over and make dedicated t2 combat hulls for them. drop the sig radius and give them a bonus to small module rep/boost amount. that would definately make them quite viable on today's battlefield.=)"

6/25/2010,"freighters can already carry rigged ships.courier system, boys and girls. courier.not supported."
6/25/2010,"no not supported.i cant find the source but the last time ccp said they were interested in removing learning skills it was a number of years ago. sometime after another ccp representative said it was unlikely they would ever do so. typically it is people who have a reason to complain who will do so on these forums and as far as i can tell most players i know are happy with learning skills. i have found that new players are actually encouraged by them.if learning skills were removed i would say that the remaining emphasise on skill points would shift towards implants that are currently quite costly. this could well have the effect of making players less liable to move to 0.0 or low sec or engage in pvp since the only real benefit they have left from the implants could be lost and need to be replaced.looking at threads like this one i can see that there is real opposition to a change in learning skills. in my opinion that while not unanimous, players on the whole are happy with learning skills. i have had many players over the years thank me for my time in teaching why they are so important and i have never had one person since late 2006 suggest they were a bad idea. this makes me feel we are seeing the unhappy few complaining.i really do hope that learning skills stay."
6/25/2010,"oh look the conservatives in the ""it's fine,"" camp are out again.for god's sake how can you not support this with a strait face? it's a chore and there's no reason for it. stop acting like training learning skills is somehow a thoughtful and strateigic thing to do. it's blatantly obvious training up learnin skills is beneficial in the long run, there's no question about it. the pay-off might only be realised after a year or more, but it's there, so anyone with half a clue will be training them as quickly as possible.i've got learning 5/5 on three characters total and i'm apalled this is still an issue."
6/25/2010,it isn't a chore and it isn't an issue. i'm apalled that anyone would think so.
6/25/2010,"learning skills are not more of a chore than any other skill. learning skills are just a part of a skill-system with one basic trait: getting sp takes time. the whole skill-training-system can be seen as a chore.i mean, why does skills have training time multipliers? isn't it a chore to train skills that take months with training time multipliers of five or more? the multipliers just have one purpose and that is to make sure that acquiring that skill take lots of time.maybe ccp should take away the multipliers or at least make it so that no skill have higher multiplier than 3. those that already have those skills will not lose anything. how can you defend the chore of having to train skills with multipliers of 4-12? having learning skills can essentially be seen as the rest of the skills have a smaller time-multiplier. learning skills put you in the awkward position of having to choose between a short-time benefit and benefits that are far ahead in the future. so there is the possibility to plan and also to make poor choices. i took my time to get through the learning skills, training lots of other skills in between. sure, i could have a few more sp now if i took a faster rout. big deal?if you are new in the game and want learning skills just like anybody else, then you have to go through the same steps as anybody else."
6/25/2010,"oh look it's the entitlement crew out for a stroll.harden up. learning skills are an option. they provide depth to the game. go play your fps on the xbox 360 if you want a shallow game. some of us use our brains and hands when playing eve, i realize that may be difficult for you, i know - sue someone! sure, entitlement at it's best. i don't have to work for stuff, i should just be given it because i'm special...htfu or get off the ride...."
6/25/2010,so ccp are implementing a system for distributing pools of skill points.did somebody say speculation?
6/25/2010,that's your definition of depth?
6/25/2010,"the argument that by training learnings only for the first 2 months means you will lose out on a reimbursement is flawed.for each of those learning skills you have trained you have increased your sp/hour for the duration of those 2 months. these increases allowed you get the next tier of learning faster which in turn allowed you more sp/hour. the net effect of this is that over the 2 months where the hypothetical other character didn't train learnings and just trained for things that made isk is that you will have something that isk can't buy, more sps.if learning skills are removed you will still have received the benefit of training them, through the bonus they gave you while you were training them. when your sp are reimbursed you will end up in a better position that the other guy. so how are you losing out?"
6/25/2010,"learning skills are bad game design, this should have been done a long time ago. supported"
6/25/2010,"not supported.the reasons are many and varied, most of them eloquently outlined here.the only way i would even slightly consider supporting the removing of learning skills is if after it was all said and done reimbursement-wise everyone had their attributes set back to their original low values... with no way to raise them.learning skills wouldn't look so bad then, would they?"
6/25/2010,"why not let every one roll a jedi right out of the gate? why make them do any training at all? its so unfair that every one can't fly a titan their first week in. no wait...thats stupid, it makes games fail. also veterans *****ing about having to train stuff on their alts is what i see here. new players don't know anything about learning skills until some vet comes along and berates them for not having them all to level 5. people figure out the best balance on their own. few ship, few weapons, few learning, no one except vets sit and train learning skills for two weeks. stop trying to dumb down the game."
6/25/2010,"not supported, and this is why."
6/25/2010,"to all comparing potential removal of learning skills to swg:nge, go burn in hell.when i started playing i spend more than half of time of first two months learning damn learning skills. and it was annoying as hell. if i learn ""someship level 4"" skill i get to fly that ship better. you spend tons of time learning learning skills without any immediate or direct benefits. you only know that it will pay out over a long period of time. there is harsh and cruel, and there are needless timesinks.as for learning to level 5. holy smoke. i understand that people got basics to 5 when it was prequel to advanced learning, but now? a two year plan in evemon will give me a 5 day speedup with 3 ""basic"" learning skills to 5. i wonder how long skillplan would i have to make for all to 5 to give a 10 minute bonus?"
6/25/2010,"to train or not train learning skills is just another part of eve. its like deciding to train for a hulk or for better mining lasers, to training faster weapon cycle or longer range. its a tactical decision that all players face. if you don't like them, don't train them. i'm happy to pronounce that i got almost all of them to 5 and cruising along most skills."
6/25/2010,"dear ccp,they need to be back as soon as humanly possibly. i used them heavily. it cannot be that hard for ccp to re add them. it is unacceptable not to be able to sort people into custom folders. when i sort people standings do not matter. for example i have folders such as: friends, corp, alts (folders for my alts and each of my friend's alts), trade, transportation, missions, kos, wormholes, production, etc. i had folders for about each reason there could be. the 5 standing tabs do not do the job. i need to be able to sort my contacts as i see fit!i even had folders with just one person in them so i could find them real quick and not have to search through all my contacts.thank you for the future reinstatement of contact folders,-zykrus"
6/25/2010,"where did my folders go? oh, ccp deleted them. good work guys, if someone got a thread 8 pages long in just a month of ppl complaining about not having folders with a (if not extremely close to) 100% agreemeant that they should be back. 2 words to you at ccp, epic fail.p.s. +1, supported, and all that jazz"

6/25/2010,"if ccp wants to push every one to low and null sec( which is apparent with the lvl 5 mission ""fix"" and all the high lvl 4 agents in low sec), why not make the missions more like pvp? if pvp is the end game, then why doesn't the only combat related carebear activity not prepare you for actual combat? pve would actually happen in low-sec maybe. mission runners being fit for pvp may actually create some pirate tears. or give them targets who actually might make them earn the kill.missions need a revamp. rats need to be smarter and use pvp tactics. preparing players for what this game intended(shooting people in the face)."
6/25/2010,"so because the situation is terrible and broken, we shouldn't fix it?"
6/25/2010,this would be great!
6/25/2010,good idea.
6/25/2010,100 times yes!
6/25/2010,"hmm.. i am pretty sure ccp stated that living in wormholes wasn't actually what they had in mind, so seing this happen is hard for mebut i support it to the fullest!"
6/25/2010,"if you have spai's they have access to the bookmarks that are shared to the corp already. be it via a hanger or a can.if my pod is capable of transfering my consiousness hundreds of lightyears in the instant before it explodes, why then can my ship not transmit spatial coordinates to other shipslet's not forget to bring up the lag that is generated when copying bookmarks, or when opening a container that has bookmarks inside it.and who in their right mind would limit the number of bookmarks that can be copied at one time to five."
6/25/2010,would love to see this change.
6/25/2010,two thumbs up from me!
6/25/2010,good idea.
6/25/2010,don't even have to read past the topic title to support this.
6/25/2010,give us corp bookmarks please!
6/25/2010,i approve of this change. i think its a good first step in fixing some of the issues that the current bookmark system has.
6/25/2010,would make wh life much easier./supported!
6/25/2010,"ccp already did it with corp fittings, why not do it with bms.not only people in whs use bm's, everyone does. do it like the fittings setup, limit the numbers of bookmarks a corp can have at any given time, if its necessarie.... but please do it"
6/25/2010,"as with every time this issue is raised, i support this improvement."
6/25/2010,yes please
6/25/2010,supported and hi wulf!
6/25/2010,1
6/25/2010,"hmmm, why didn't anyone think of this before? support!"
6/25/2010,i agree
6/25/2010,would be useful
6/25/2010,yes please. would be really great for residents of w-space. makes sense to add it in.
6/25/2010,not really.
6/25/2010,"you seriously made a character just to alt post in this thread with a 2nd alt?in all seriousness i do not think your 21 man, 0 % tax corp is going to hold sov regardless of mechanics"
6/25/2010,"thats not my char, i only keep 2 chars for the forums and that isnt one of them :/this char aside i have been sincere about everything i have said, once again the issue isnt diplomacy its the ability to as you goons once said 'being able to blue all of 0.0 freely'.anyway last few days i have been checking around talking etc and i have came up with the following.1. alliance are **** scared (funny enough sc dont really care as they have been against the odds many times dr dont care either but nc were hugely offended by my comments :s) having diplomacy changes where bluing everything within 40 jumps was changed was a worrying factor (for some), 2. 0.0 is pretty much a joke, it really is a case of who can crash the node or blob first vs how active a person is (interestingly a strategy less practiced by certain alliances and used as an only strategy by some)3. everything else i stated a few posts ago0.0 whine all the time they want empire to move there and it isnt fair that xxx is allowed to get risk free isk etc but its ironic since 0.0 is comical and makes empire look good.you want empire to have some interest in 0.0 you give them a reason, players will never much like sov issues change their 'diplomatic' ways unless ccp intervene and until that happens you can class 0.0 as uneventful and boring where 3 powerblocs continue to ermm 'do' something in 0.0 while they macro rat.looking at historical events i can understand why you are so quick to be against this anyway, but if ccp did change this i would hope for it to not be completely anti-nc but really i guess if ccp changed diplomacy making it difficult or inefficient to nap you guys would be the first effected :shame:"
6/25/2010,"haha, ok now i know you're trolling."
6/25/2010,you tell em ed.give it up guys. you want ccp to make changes to do the work for you and that is just not how this game is played.
6/25/2010,"nothing you can do will actually change 0,0 without alienating players and ccp wont do thatif you say removed blue standings and naps etc,,within 24hours all corps in each bloc would reform into three new super alliances called northern coalition, southern coalition and so on,you cant just tell the coalitions to break up because the label says player driven, so if we form blocks well there you go,if it bothers you form a great crusade call forth the corporations of empire to make a vast horde that shall darken the skies of nullsec and carve a new empire, then pick a region and conquer it if you dont want to join one of the big three and feel there needs to be more variety dont just say this sux force the blocks to break up, get some friends and make a new faction and do it yourselfthat said if ccp did double our income from anomalies and such living in smaller areas would begin to be more viable as it is a few people can earn isk roughly equivalent of l4 per system but its not many"
6/25/2010,"confirming the bawwww is strong with this thread.the stench of entitlement to current holdings is rancid. 9 of 10 wouldn't be able to retain their current borders if it wasn't bloody impossible to take anything these days and so the grab-ass continues unabated.i suppose you all think it's good design to funnel players from npc empire into player empire (halariously, i've had fewer ship losses in 0.0 because of nap'ing than in actual empire space and i'm sure that i'm not the only one), both of which are propped up by game mechanics designed to promote border stability rather than actual dynamic player-driven competition.no, this isn't fist, and no, naps don't make for interesting warfare. pull your head out of your collective nap'ing asses and realize there hasn't been an interesting null conflict in ages. it's time for change."
6/25/2010,"maybe your right, but its not ccp's buisness to make pvp conform to your expectations, its up to you to change it by getting allies , pvp has a player on both sidesthough i for one will live in my npc empire as they are less demanding land lords, but i look forward to your campaign going out to teach them nap blocks a lesson"
6/25/2010,you seriously made a character just to alt post in this thread?
6/25/2010,"i feel your pain. the ever increasing blobs/naps is why i went low-sec instead .. 0.0 fun is far to erratic (ie. few and far between) to be of any use except as an isk printing machine.as already stated, the de-evolution of gameplay cannot be stopped as it is tied to human nature, nap trains are here to stay.what we can and should do is create ability for small entities to exist ""alone"" and make small scale warfare viable (ie. impact sovereign space without node-crash fleets) .. with an option of actual fun to be had without waiting for the last 700 people to arrive the number of people wanting/needing to nap up will stagnate.human nature can be challenging to influence, but it is doable."
6/25/2010,"until everything and i mean all things - skill books, infrastructure upgrades, bp's the last npc seeded goods can be made locally in 0,0 alliances need reliable access to empire in order to sustain themselves,now with regions like branhc, period basis, omist, outer passage these are far and isolated from empire, so access to empire becomes an issue of incredible military force or nap'sthe people next to them end up in similar grounds and next thing you know you have either a nap conga line to empire or one all powerful alliance, its neighbours nap with it or nap together agains it,and thus the situation is born"
6/25/2010,"that ought to be right, but as we've pointed out - in this very thread - the situation is such that some players cannot become involved and those who currently are involved cannot be motivated to change this fact. allowing the status quo is a defacto statement that no new alliances or corps (aside from those born out of present power blocks) will be allowed in nullsec and that current alliances will not have the freedom to war as they see fit, but rather must first consider their geographical block politic first and foremost.this isn't a purely player contruct. changes to sov, game mechanics in null, and changes elsewhere have all come together to create this perfect storm of cowardice. i don't think it's realistic to say that nap's can end (hell, they might even get larger) without a major player or ccp taking initiative, and since we're already ruled out players taking that initiative (out of self-interest to the obvious dog-pile)..."
6/25/2010,"for the record ending naps wont have people bombard you, for what i have gathered atlas dislike it as much as nc do but due to dominion mechanics wont invade.i can see why nc has to continue to be naped its their only advantage to well getting attacked, would explain why in the past 3 years node crashes have mainly occurred when nc are around in fact i am yet to find this not be the case.i will spare the caod talk since i will be up against the whole of nc and dont wish to be blobbed, as for sc it appears there is no longer a coalitionso theres nc (same gang since 2005, more than 12 regions napped with blues reaching more than 50 jumps away)it coalition (delve querious fountain)aaa coalitionatlas coalitionprovidence ffa (independent however aaa will intervene on sov wars)atlas coalitiondrone region coalition (size wise look big but relatively smaller than other coalitions)southern independent alliances, such as goonswarm mk iii, pl which are part of the nc napfest.southern independent alliances with and without sov such as ev0ke (no doubt will get hotdropped once mh are close to die)once again apologies to saying theres 3 nap fests, currently theres only one major one, judging by this thread you can see who"
6/25/2010,i don't think you understand 0.0 politics at all.
6/25/2010,i dont think you do either tbh
6/25/2010,we can't always live in interesting times.
6/25/2010,"grouping up is players choice. personally i would like nul to be more chaotic and alittle less blobby. make it deadly to blob (like in the battle dust thread) and people will stop. it is impossible to stop major alliances forming alliances with eachother. (isn't the point of an alliance to group up for joint defence?) there is no reason to make the alliance stop. all it does is make the wars 10x more epic when they do happen (aka, daily multinode crashing with +3000 ships)."
6/25/2010,"will obviously you have no room to speak in this topic. seriously check you info noob. rorquals have never been able to use gates. they can use jump bridges you are right there but they take up massive amounts of fuel, and further more you know a titan pilot that would bridge a rorqual ?"
6/25/2010,the guy who thinks a rorq can use gates needs to recheck his facts
6/25/2010,"jump bridges on rorquals would encourage low sec and null sec mining. i can't imagine anyone who would fly a hulk down through pirates and camps just to get to a mining op, and no one brings out a rorqual (and its maintenance bay with 5 ships) just for 5 pilots.i support."
6/25/2010,/signedthe idea of different command center levels is pretty odd!
6/25/2010,why would anyone bother trainig command centers past level 1 then? it makes perfect sense.
6/25/2010,mmos should not be simple. especially not eve.
6/25/2010,"lol.. it's not about easily being able to make that amount of isk.. it's about people actually having to train for it.. wich you obviously can't be bothered to do.. but to be honest with you, before this idea even gets considered (wich it shouldn't be in any way shape or form) by ccp you could have trained that skill to 5 numerous times - just train it and quit being lazy"
6/25/2010,"because in eve, skills have five levels."
6/25/2010,"well obviously the skill would be changed if such an idea was to be implemented. for example, +15% grid and cpu per lvl of ""command centers"". whole idea is that a colony would be upgraded as the skill increased rather than just be liquidated."
6/25/2010,this would be more logical which of course is not allowed by ccp. things must be arcane and a pain in the ass otherwise it is not eve.imo 1 cc for each planet type and cpu/grid expand like they do for our ships would be a better system.
6/25/2010,"ok i am all for cloakies, and covert ops and recons etc but its becoming a bit ridiculous that gangs of ships can camp systems for long periods of time and be pretty much invunerable, and combined these gangs can be formiddable even when uncloaked!so lets say you have a rapier, pilgrim, stealth bomber, arazu all nice cloaked specialise ships, but also have some serious teeth, especially when used to together. now again im not concerned about these ships, the point is as mentioned above.now something has to be done about being able to detect where these are, im not saying make it easy but perhaps have another skill, perhaps 'covert probing', you need max probing skills also maybe, and perhaps a specialised covert/recon probing ship.but damn do something this is not on, that nothing can be done about gangs like this."
6/25/2010,so your idea is basically to make stealth ships not.do i even have to point out why this is a bad idea?
6/25/2010,i say no. sure stealth bombers are strong. but they do insta pop.
6/25/2010,"let me translate: ""i'm not saying make it easy, but let it be done by a single skill with high prerequistes and a specialized ship.""are you serious? how is that not ""easy""? how much more easy can it become, if there ever were such a thing implemented (which hopefully never ever happens)?furthermore, probing down cloaked ships, is completely negating anything what the cloak is usefull for: staying off the scan-reports. deal with it."
6/25/2010,dont fix what aint broken.
6/25/2010,"lol thanks for the wall of comments from cloak ship pilots...funny...this is why i love debates like this, because no one puts there thinkinh head on....so i guess its ok that a system(s) can be entirely locked down by quite a formiddable gang of ships as mentioned before and theres not a damn thing you can do about it...seriously think about stuff before you post...now to the chap above, it wouldnt be a single skill now would it...1 skill for being able to probe cloaked ships1 skill for the actual ship (which may have prereqs)then you must have all the other probing type skills, astro etc to lvl 5. so please tell me how the hell is that easy!!!stop taking out of that bum hole...thats quite training you have to complete...so like any specialised training, each type of ship must have a counter in some way and this forces that counter, but you have to specialise in it.i think cloak ships should give off some sort of signature that can only be detectable by specialised probes, and again combined with high skills and the right specialised ship...dont start crying because i propose away for you to be probed out and you cant sit there cloaked and not actually work for your kills...oh sorry you just want it easy..forgive me sorry...tsk"
6/25/2010,"player a = ""i'd like ccp to give us a hisec doomsday device""player b = ""that would be just rediculous""player a = ""waaaaaaaaah !!1!1!! elevenone !!1!1 ure not putting your thinkinh head on !!1!1!""take that, cicero..."
6/25/2010,"while you are at it, please add some skills for:- getting people out of the station/outposts when ever i want a kill- disabling the pos shields when ever i want a kill.then we dont have to cloak for so long until you finally grew some balls to undock/leave the pos shield.if you are so afraid of cloaked people ... ever thought to adapt your style of playing a bit to be a less easy prey? rat in combat fit ships (yes it really works), rat in groups of 2-3, guard your mining ops. but i guess it is easier to ask for a nerf of others before adapting?adapt or die - pick a side.p.s.: i wouldnt worry so much about afk cloaker. i would worry about the guys who are not afk."
6/25/2010,"you're going to get flamed to high hell, diosas, but just for you i'm actually going to try and work my way through your post and point out where the primary fallacies lie.what do cloaks have to do with ships ""locking you down""? what you're suggesting is a way to hunt out hiding cloaked ships. the ships that hunt you are going to be constantly moving. you're only going to be able to probe a ship that's sitting passively somewhere or other doing basically nothing.i'm trying to picture the scenario in which probing would prevent a cloaked ship from getting ""cheap kills"". how exactly do you envision this working?a cloaked ship has two advantages: one, the ability to hide, and two, the element of surprise. hiding is not an aggressive action, it's an evasive one, so there's no real way to ""get cheap kills"" by hiding. so let's concentrate on the element of surprise.the element of surprise comes from when you're doing something or other and suddenly a ship decloaks out of nowhere and locks you down before you know what's going on. whatever you think of this, probing wouldn't help; if a ship is actively stalking you, you're not going to have time to lock him down and probe the bastard out, he's going to be right on top of you before you can even get a general idea of where he is.advice:don't post an idea when you've just been killed. there's a natural desire to want revenge, but trying to get meta and change the system around your opponents is not the way to do it.if you're looking for a mercenary corp, i hear good things about the nintendo generation or some such."
6/25/2010,cloaks are fine... dont break it
6/25/2010,"cloakies are supposed to have zero risk to themselves and provide all the risk to non-cloakies, mining ships, pve ships, etc. it's what this game is all about, risk (to pveers) versus rewards (for the cloakies). so no."
6/25/2010,this was the part where your post started being wrong. everything after that was auto-fail because it was based on your false initial hypothesis.cloaked ships are fine.
6/25/2010,"in before afk cloaker.also, no."
6/25/2010,the only reason i'd ever want cloaked ships to be found with a probing system would be for people to stop making threads about it.but i don't think it's worth it.
6/25/2010,so if anyone can find a cloaker... why would you want to bother with cloaking then?
6/25/2010,"i believe most people want it so that yes, anyone can find a cloaker.. who has been sitting afk for the past hour/s. eve is not a safe game, what makes you think you can sit there in your cloak ship for five hours in spot and be safe?"
6/25/2010,my cloak?
6/25/2010,"as has been said to every person when they complain about getting blown up, there are only two safe places in eve. docked at an npc station and logged out."
6/25/2010,epic fail op
6/25/2010,and cloaked.
6/25/2010,"yeah, but you know the old saying:as long as thy don't try to interact with anybody else nor with the environment, the cloak will keep you safe-sun tzu, art of war"
6/25/2010,"cloaker ships: the only ship class in eve that comes with a built-in pvp flag. see a target you can overpower and take on? switch that pvp flag on and gank at will. can't take on the target? easy, just keep the pvp flag turned off (ie stay cloaked).eve, a cruel and harsh universe... except for cloakies."
6/25/2010,"here's the thing: once it becomes possible, it will become common. once it becomes common, cloaked ships will become useless.i'm ok with the idea of some form of nerf to cloaking, but making cloaks detectable is not it. increase the decloak radius, give cloaks an inertial penalty, hell, make it so you can't cloak with an aggression timer. these ideas don't destroy cloaking, but to varying degrees they increase the risks to cloakers while they are on the same grid with others."
6/25/2010,"the scanner needs an overhaul along with local chat. but i don't support your idea. given the way the d-scanner currently works, it would kill the server."
6/25/2010,"the scanner needs a change as in its current form it is heavily biased toward the predator style of play. i will offer my support, not necessarily limited to the op's idea, but for a change overall. the current scanner needs a serious rethink."
6/25/2010,"just the warning is enough, but i support."
6/25/2010,'your order has been canceled.' **** it . atleast warn us its going to happen. all it will take to fix is click 3 things and copy/paste from the 'you are about to enter low sec' warning message.

6/25/2010,"the t3 market might seem impossible right now, but something tells me there's more to it than meets the eye. for one, some people probably mine and undercut without worrying about the price of the stuff they're mining - such as for the joy of manufacturing.others may have special connections to get the items cheaper, or visit hard-to-reach places like null-sec to pick up the items. in either case, this is a player-run economy, so if people have advantages over you, they're gonna take it. htfu."
6/25/2010,"the real problem with the t3 market is that the t3 market was broken from day 1. the way it is broken is that every racial variation of hull and subsystems use the exact same materials in the exact same quantities for every race. that means one or two materials will always be a bottleneck and the rest will be practically worthless. it means every single ship costs the exact same to build and profit margins get eaten up by a lack of diversity. the material cost is set by the highest selling hull, the profit margins by the lowest selling hull.now consider: if each race focused on different materials the average income for a wher would go up, the income of t3 producers would go up, and the cost of t3 ships would go down.another thing to consider: less than half the subsystems are useful enough to be profitable. half of what's left is completely worthless. if using re you get a worthless bpc you can't sell it, you'd be stupid to build with it, only thing you can do is trash it. not sure if that should be 'fixed' but it seems to me that every bpc should at least be able to break even with production costs, which could be done by changing the material costs in a way that balances competition between materials.in short: yes wh/t3 needs to be balanced, but op doesn't seem to understand the issues, and apparently ccp's economics phd doesn't seem to either. supported because it needs a review, not supporting op's suggestion to increase drop rates."
6/25/2010,"suupporting mkmin, hannah should get a tiii tinfoil hat."
6/25/2010,"working as intendedwhat's the issue?ps: t3 market is fine. skill requirements are fine as well.save a few tweaks in drop rates, t3 industry was implemented pretty well. the one thing that would bring down prices is the ability to reprocess subsystems. as of now a lot of people get bpcs they don't want, manufacture before looking at prices and then realize no one wants that crap, so they sell for less than the material cost to recoup some of their loss. with the ability to buy these items and reprocess them, materials would be recycled and prices would possibly drop for the subsystems in higher demand.or people could stop building every bpc they get .mkmin is right however, more diverse material requirements would definitely help lower prices"
6/25/2010,"well, i have been in this 1 system for the past 2 days and i have noticed that there are a bunch of macro ice miners here. 1 group in particular, a 5 man ice mining team that runs 23/7 today however the hauler of the ice mining group got logged. the other 4 are continuing to mine and dropping a load of jet cans in the belt. auto reject invitation is on, and they dont respond in local. this leads me to believe that even after 15 people sent petitions about it... ccp does not care if you macro mine. personally i love to blow up macro miners, however in this case they are in a .7 system and i cant solo suicide them. :( what do you guys think?"
6/25/2010,the answer you are looking for is:1. report them2. get a tempest/maelstrom and kill them ;)

6/25/2010,"actually, apocs are fine and cost as much as maelstroms but don't require lv 5 battleship skills to have as high of an alpha. any ship with 8 turret slots works equally well, but the apoc is the cheapest one that most players can use and still do max alpha strike.fit them with 8 1400mm artillery in the highs, target painters and tracking computers in the mids (both scripts), and gyrostabs in the lows (plus maybe one tracking enhancer). sentry drones too but they're unnecessary. sometimes you need to load some guns with emp and some with fusion, but this makes killing them when concord's in the belt tricky.disco phoons don't work solo against hulks."
6/25/2010,"he said that they're ice miners, so they're in mackinaws. you should be able to get off 10k damage or so before concord kills you, depending on system security. i've never tried, but one would think that's enough."

6/25/2010,"i agree that this proposal further than the vast majority of proposals. i doubt ccp would implement it in exactly as stated. yet i do think this is much more helpful than simply saying ""fix faction war"" and then listing vague ideas or goals. this proposal provides an example of how to achieve a pvp centered occupancy mechanic that is sufficiently spread out to eliminate blob=iwin but instead creates a strategically (not just tactically) rich war environment. not only would tactics on the battle grid be important (who to primary etc) but bigger picture strategies like assigning resources (pilots to certain plexes, and supplies to certain bases) to different parts of the front would be important. to perform well with this sort of large strategic front you would likely want some battlecruisers and battleships docked throughout the region so you can capture the different types of plexes. logistics (not the ships but the supplies) would become very important. do you have ships *nearby* to take this type of plex? that battleship 20 jumps away will not be much help. the problem is only 100 some players have even read this proposal. and many probably just decided tl;dr. as far as the imminent meeting, i really dont know what they are going to do. other than the bug fixes and some minor tweaks that really wont change much, (already on the backlog) nothing has been endorsed by the players that would change the overwhelming apathy toward occupancy. even if the current plexes spawn throughout the day its not like waves of people will start doing it. it will still be the same pve hide and seek plexing.i think ank will present the ideas. i agree all of her ideas for fw occupancy have been good ones  that is they have (or will) improve fw occupancy. (if not all then pretty much all of them) but those ideas are really like trying to polish a turd. fw occupancy needs to make some large changes or at least some key changes to be great.im not sure the devs read the features and ideas threads. i can almost guarantee this thread will just drop like a brick there. its long and involves a game mechanic 99.9% of eve has given up on. if you like this idea give it support."
6/25/2010,"i'm sure that this has been brought up before, and i'm sure it will be again.ccp wants people to get on sisi for the mass test they do to try and narrow down the problems with lag/desync so that they can solve that problem (at least as close as you can get). something ii think would drive people to take the time to create a seperate client (essentially) and log on for these test is giving characters all level 5 skills.they have done this in the past, during the cap ship / titan changes iirc, so this is something they can do almost at will. to be completely honest i've never even tried the singularity server out so i'm speaking from the side that i'm trying to convince to participate. this would drive a number of new players over to the sisi server for these tests. many people would love to shot the titan doomsday or fly a nyx super cap but will probably never have the chance to do such things on tq.give them the chance on sisi and i would be willing to bet that these test become largely more popular, would bring a larger variety of players, and would also give many people a reason to go through the work of getting on sisi.ccp regularly says they would like to have close to 500 or so people on sisi during these tests, and while i'm not sure on the average amount of players they get i feel safe in assuming its not usually that high. entice people to come and join these tests. what better way to test server load then have 1000 people in a system in caps/bs/t2/t3 ships. it would be as close to a true 0.0 blob fight as you could get./end rant"
6/25/2010,"wha..?ccp gives all level 5 to the stuff they are actually interested in testing. sisi is a bonus, but it's not part of the game. as such it has nothing at all to do with csm."
6/25/2010,"part of the point of sisi is to test tactics and stuff. if you are forced to have max skills you won't have the same ranges, tracking speeds, capacitor, resistances, or hundreds of other factors. also it would potentially hide skills related bugs. now, once they finish the skillpoint distribution tool i'd like to see it applied to sisi, so i could spend skills on an alt so i could test things i think i'd like to train for without breaking my main."
6/25/2010,if a lag free enviroment isnt enough of a reward for you then you aren't the group the tests are aimed at.
6/25/2010,the last time ccp gave everyone all lvl5s and supercaps the testing didnt really go well. that said ...not supported.
6/25/2010,"this is the first time i've heard of an ""ez-mode."" let us pray its nothing more than a free slighty-boosted starter skill pack for beginners across the board. anything else would be an insult to players who've paid their dues. ccp, please dont give us an eve renaissanceit only took one expansion to break uo, so lets hope the op's foreshadowing doesn't come to pass."
6/25/2010,i agree totally !!! 100 % the fonts should be bigger. (a way bigger). my friends also said that and people that saw eve for the first time. ccp please do something about it.

6/25/2010,"sok and some others start troll campaign against ankh, giving free publicity, people realise ankh got good points, people vote for ankh. that and people just vote for ankh because they got bored of the amount of trolls and flames coming from sok and alts, and maybe preferred someone who actually had an opinion. (see soks campaign thread, nothing in it regarding his opinion about stuff).people want fw fixed, and looking at the voting results there were only two possibilities to vote on if you want that.wtf is it you smoke?sec status doesnt mean **** outside high sec, and for inside high sec they use alts. if you suicide gank an empty jf it costs the target way more than it costs you. new insurance helps a bit, before this it was always profitable to stage a suicide gank, even if it didnt drop anything. now at least it needs to drop a tad before it is profitable, but still the target will always lose more than the gankers, even if empty.edit: but serious, if people would just look at what ankh actually proposes they wouldnt have to go emo about it. look at her proposals in this csm, is any of them a removal of pvp? i would say for everyone of them the vast majority of the eve players is in favour. and while i still dont get why other csm members voted in favour of bugged fw, from what i understand they arent actually against a non-bugged fw."
6/25/2010,"what she proposes, and how she is an impossible, paranoid, beeatch to work with are two entirely separate things.as it stands, the rest of the csm are all puking all over her worthless behaviour, and she will get precisely 0 done.i'd say it would be in the fluffy carebears' favour at this point if they sack her and take one a rational human being without the personality of a screeching hag. that way you may actually get some of what you want."
6/25/2010,"ahhh, the traditional ank-partisan nonsense; anybody who disagrees with ank must be a troll. anybody who raises valid objections pointing out why ank isn't suited for serving on the csm they must be a troll too. and anybody who quotes ank's own words showing that she's conceptually and perceptually incompatible with a pvp game on a single shard? why, the only possible thing they can be is a troll since, after all, it is impossible to disagree with ank unless you're somehow dishonest about it. yah...as for ""fixing fw"", it should of course be noted that most of ank's suggestions for doing so are worse than useless and, in fact, display a marked ignorance about the mechanics involved. this is most likely due to her stunning lack of participation in the actual mechanics of fw (she has, what, 7 kills? 8?) the 'bears and beginning pvpers could have gotten an actual representative on the council rather than this creature. ah, so you have no clue how eve works (why is that so common among ank-partisans?). sec status matters because if you can make it back to a highsec gate, you can escape from a red flashy with pretty much 100% certainty. pirates can't do the same. and i notice you skipped over all the actual balance examples in order to whine about, not balance, but the fact that people can take down larger targets if they work in groups and if those targets aren't defended. gee, you think? your whine about ""cost"" also betrays ignorance. pirates making a profit off ganking something with no loot? no, not ever. and the ability to gank a jf is no way means that the system isn't balanced. the situation is actually unbalanced in the direction of favoring non-pirates, and that still isn't good enough for you. if a non-combat ship can be destroyed by attackers well, then, call the waaaaaaaaambulance because you're about to cry and someone needs to deal with those pirates!!!"
6/25/2010,"by replying and debating on ankh's topic before the election, both ankh's alts / allies & critics gave her visibility. blame yourselves.she also had an ok pr campaign, and used the critics as a way to emerge as 'the champion of carebearing against evil trolling pirates'.i wish that next time a proper 'carebear candidate' emerges, with good pr, and who doesn't feel more relevant in puzzle pirates than in eve (coz' seriously, linked chatlogs were ranging between hilarious and seriously creepy).elections do not show who is the most competent, but certainly who is the most competent in selling his own image."
6/25/2010,"i tried to point this out in other (anti) ahnk threads. ahnk got dam near 3 times as many votes as sok, and twice as many votes as others... lots of people have tried to tell me that its all because of how she went about campaigning... i have to believe that no small part of her success is because of two things:#1 - she represents (on some level) ideas that someone agrees with...#2 - all the negative press (in fact and general) *had* to get people who might not otherwise have voted motivated to vote. since the negative press, attack threads and editorials seemed to share a particular slant (being from pvp'rs in general) - this gave some significant portion of the voting base a symbol to rally around. i don't think its stretching it to say we can all agree that symbols can be powerful motivators. my personal opinion (based on nothing more than my own experience) is that 1/4 to 1/2 of her votes came from people who felt a vote for ahnk was ""pvp'ing"" those they disliked.i do believe that the csm is better off with one ""ahnk"" than three other delegates with her ideas..."
6/25/2010,"unofficial reports have surfaced of a fourth screaming meltdown from ankh at the pve roundtable in iceland. stay tuned, laydeez n' gennelmen - can this plucky contender keep up her 100% record over the months to come?"
6/25/2010,i'm excited.who's excited?i'm excited.
6/25/2010,"you mean someone actually believes what sok tells? come on, if dierdra or something would tell something i would take it serious, but sok, he hasnt made a single post not flaming ankh the last year.sok prolly alone managed to get ankh half her votes, i wonder if ankh is paying him tbh."
6/25/2010,"we have an escalation!not content with simply raging at everyone around her, ankh has flipped out ninja-style and taken to flinging cutlery at her fellow council members! some accuse her of being anti-pvp, but they couldn't be more wrong; this woman is a stone-cold killer. she just does it in rl.(i am not joking)"
6/25/2010,[citation needed]
6/25/2010,i would very much love to know whose alt you are.
6/25/2010,"i probably didn<U+FFFD>t because i only made like 5 posts in any of the ankh hate threads and none of them was very comprehensive. one thing that definitely did help me getting in again was a certain guy named <U+FFFD>natana<U+FFFD> going full ****** on the eve germany boards against me and proposing her as a better alternative, making him the laughing stock of said forums and attracting a whole lot of attention to my campaign thread.but hey, apparently there is a large audience that votes for her regardless of the lies and the incompetency and the shenanigans, which is fine with me. she doesn<U+FFFD>t get anything done any way."
6/25/2010,"this is what i was worried about, however i would like to point out that the south doesnt look as naped as lets say the north, so apologies to comparing all coalitions.for more information on what the hell i am on about and why certain coalitions only are so angry by my proposal feel free to read up on history of all the major alliances now.i would personally start with 'the longest nap in eden'i will be honest i left 0.0 about 2 months ago when it was 3 powerblocs and never really cared about 0.0 anymore, however i have noticed within 2 months the south is pleasantly rejecting naps around (aaabefore resetting have even said ""it is unhealthy to have things napped in 50 jumps"").so i guess what it really boils down to is people having balls i guess, since if ccp nerfed how naping works sadly the only coalition now that will be affected is nc which isnt really fair imo.cant wait to hear how vuk plans to 'end blob warfare'"
6/25/2010,"just start spreading rumors about the alliance leaders ****ing each other's wives, that ought to get things going."
6/26/2010,"there is a problem with creating a new font. the eve font supports a wide range of unicode characters, and creating an all-new font would require a lot of work.so i think the fixes should be:1. edit those characters in the existing fonts that look too similar. 1, i, l, |, o, 0, etc. the eve fonts are sans-serif fonts, but that should not be an impediment to adding a few serifs to an otherwise sans-serif font if it improves readability.2. when creating a new larger font, there is no need to create a new font from scratch. just scale up an existing font instead. the result may be a little blocky but it would do the job until a better font was created."
6/26/2010,"htfu everyone, do you want this game to become hello kitty online?""more readable fonts plz!"", no way. veterans of this game succeeded with the fonts as they are, and it is just a case of you not wanting to adapt, silly spoiled carebears. so what if you ruin your eyesight, its a worthy sacrifice for ccp and eve.on a serious note. another of braindead obvious issues that must be fixed asap. though depending on coding it might not be as simple as it could be expected."
6/26/2010,"yes yes yes, as screen resolutions get bigger fonts get smaller. this is now a very serious issue with the mass use of high definition resolutions that makes it only the very lucky few to not get eye strain reading the current eve font size."
6/26/2010,"supported as in the past, this is long overdueedit: apparently i already have, why does this issue take so long to get looked at?"
6/26/2010,players should not ever feel it is necessary to decrease screen resolution to make in-game text more readable.

6/26/2010,"so.. the solution to making a t1 hull viable is to make them t2?are t1 hulls supposed to be obselete? didn't ccp see this coming, that eventually the universe would be filled with the majority of pilots flying hacs and afs such that there is no room for the newbie in the t1 hull?thats what happens when you make the next gen of ships more than 50% stronger than the previous gen. you make gen 1 useless except in very narrow circumstances that happen .0001% of the time."
6/26/2010,think about what you just said...rifter is still used just as much as the wolf.t1 ew frigs are used just as much as their t2 counterparts. destroyers are still being used all over the place. head out to null or low sec and youll get a taste of some really good destroyer pilots.the only problem were running into is that where people are trying to use a t1 ship in essentially t2 situations and they arnt doing so well...
6/26/2010,"**** the haters do this now.tia.also, that exciting new 'hey we can give out sp' system that ccp are using for downtime compensation is perfect for this."
6/26/2010,"completely ridiculous. there is no way around it, you have to train learning skills, period. that is the problem, there is no choice. they might as well be mandatory, and the more you delay learning them the more time you lose."
6/26/2010,"i'm pro learning skills.for me learning skills are part of the whole skill training decision game, and i like them because it makes you choose between short term and long term benefits, which is a difficult decision to take any day.i personally like eve exactly because of all the tough decisions, complexity and pitfalls that the game offers, and i am against making eve all cuddly and smooth.for those that complain that learning skills are a time sink might consider the idea that a mmo is in general a well-designed time sink trying to bait you to log in every through some kind of sketchy reward scheme."
6/26/2010,strongly opposed.
6/26/2010,"i see little to no downside to this solution.honestly, i don't see why it hasn't been done already. learning skills serve no good purpose anymore, and haven't for quite some time."
6/26/2010,"just for fyi on you people saying that ohhh train all learning skills to five rabblerabblerabble.here are a few payouts from my own head which is currently 19 26 14 14 15 with no implants:iron will v when min gal and cald titan to five amarr bs 5 390d saves 12 hours 9 minclarity v when all four titans are to 5, 472 days 1 17 20 savedempathy v 146d save 22 hourspresence v 372 days all of trade half of social save four hoursjust to have those four skills to pay off i need to spend 844 days. the first two were clicked only selecting spaceship command. and the second two were clicked selecting trade and social skills, which, save a couple are all charisma primary. i think ill take the extra one point that ccp will bump from my current four to the proposed five now thank you."
6/26/2010,"except if you train learning skills instead of mining barge v and exhumers ii you don't get to fly, trade, shoot, steal, mine, or produce anything new. you merely accellerate the process at which you eventually do those things. in an era of eve when most new players are obsessed with playing catch-up (for good reason, years of skilling go into core alone if you want to pilot more than a very narrow selection of ships), you cannot ignore the ""must train"" factor in any long-term investment skills. if they aren't training (and thus ******ing their entry into more advanced activities than suicide tackle, cheapfit miner, or station trader) learning skills as far as they can from the get-go, they're loosing more time.no, you don't need 5/5 to start skilling anything, and no, you don't see a full return on investment for years, but for anyone who hasn't pre-determined that they'll quit the game before a few years are out, it's a non-decision. that's what makes learning skills bad."
6/26/2010,supported
6/26/2010,"i did report the new ""fail style"" contact list as bug some time ago. i got some answer regarding some change, but i don't even remember. extended downtime did convince me to delete all my bug reports. what a pity.nice try though!"
6/26/2010,"i don't use the contacts list much, but i have to agree removing folders was just simply please visit your user settings to re-enable images..edit: forgot the tick (again)."

6/26/2010,"note: i changed the order of suggestions within the quote to respond a little more easily.someone already mentioned saving graphics settings may not work well, as aged computers could belly-up if they load something out of their league.the ui elements and placement also wouldn't work very well, although this is more from a personal view. i run several accounts at once when i play eve, and i'm always logging out of one on one screen and logging into it at a different resolution. loading placement of elements from ccp's server rather than the saved settings on the particular computer would be a total mess, every time.completely supported, most especially the last point about exporting/importing (more than just the overview). this would make eve reinstalls way less of a hassle. also saving and storing several profiles would help people (like myself) with multiple accounts switch between 'fleet mode' and 'trade'. or 'mining', or whatever other fancy you've got.overall highly supported, big thumbs up."
6/26/2010,"my alliance's logo got turned down in the most recent expansion, with no reason given at the time. furthermore, when the alliance leader petitioned it to ask why, they pretty much told him it was their policy not to say why they turn down logos.so we have to redesign our logo, but we have absolutely no idea what is wrong with the logo in order to redesign it.and we won't know if we got the redesign right until the next expansion, and if we get it wrong, we still won't know why.does anyone else see something wrong with this picture?"
6/26/2010,not supported giving logos to alliances just encourages them to nap more
6/26/2010,"everybody in here in some way or another is contributing to have ccp make real money.ever paid for your subscription? i know you did. that's why you have the opportunity to express your opinion in here.and here's another fun point for you to think about: there's plenty of people out there who'd happily pay some extra bucks to have this or that implemented, if there'd be an option.p.s.: i'm offering a sixpack of beer if the ccp folks manage to fix the mac client crash on exit bug within two weeks."
6/26/2010,"edit: this post has been altered to coincide with the release of the primae ship.for those who aren't aware of its existence, head over to the dev blog. or click the link here. and the individual thread can be located here.in a nutshell, the primae ship is one geared towards planetary interaction. with the release of the ship on the 28th, let's look at its important stats.4x low slots150m signature radius - very small for its size (15 million kg)1000 m3 cargo space for pi materials1600 m3 cargo space for command centers240 m/sec max velocityas we can see, the primae is a great entry-level hauler for newbies and vets alike who are just breaking into pi, due to its modest cargo size and no skills necessary to fly. according to a thread located here, ccp devs believe, and i quote:greyscale also goes on to say that it was ""...deliberately not supposed to be better for common tasks than other ships, due to the fact that it's free and everyone is given one."" which is just fine, but it still retains a very suitable use.regrettably, ccp has also said in several instances in the thread linked at the top of this post that this ship will not be seeded on the market. they are a one-time gift. in my opinion, eve can certainly benefit from a ship like this on a fairly large scale. with the efficient means of hauling a decent amount of products, as well as a no sp barrier of entry, i propose this is one ship that shouldn't remain as a simple gift. this is an excellent ship for newbies and other players just breaking into pi. sadly though in the current state, the ship will most likely rot in station hangars as many pilots will be too afraid to take them out, as we saw with the other ship gifts. i propose that the blueprints should be seeded on the market, or bpcs and the ship itself be placed on ore's lp store. if this is not possible, at least have its model re-purposed to be a dedicated salvage ship, which is something players have been asking for.yay/nay?"
6/26/2010,"nay. i think you are overestimating the use of the primae over a normal hauler or a blockade runner. of course, we don't know the stats yet, so this is all speculation. seeding it will also make it less ""special"", and make it just yet another ship.edit: also, cross-posting is bad, mkay?"
6/26/2010,"no. you have no idea what the ship will even do (bonuses, stats, slots, etc - and the sisi pics don't count) and you are already asking for a bpo. does that not seem a little premature to you?"
6/26/2010,"not necessarily, the ship is coming in less than three days. it's a ship specifically designed to cater to the industrial side of eve, one that lacks in ship-specific roles. the other ships that were given away for free, i'll agree, do not really need bpos as there were 4 other types of shuttles and a ton of other cruisers. an industry ship on the other hand offers a plethora of uses, and only offering it once makes little sense."
6/26/2010,"why can't you take solace in the fact that the ship is a one-time gift? when your family or friends give you a gift, do you whine and say that you want more? you ungrateful twit."
6/26/2010,a bp is the difference between never seeing these ships undock and people actually using them.
6/26/2010,"i think i like the idea of the ship. my magic 8-ball says outcome unlikely, but a ship capable of 'deep-space' salvage, as the 'original purpose' (lolrp?) indicated fro this ship was, would be made of win.how many man-hours went into the production of this anyway?"
6/26/2010,"low and null aren't supposed to be newb friendly.but a salvage ship using the same model, sure why not."
6/26/2010,"i fully agree.besides all that work put into the excellent model would be wasted,and looking at models like the blackbird hull throwing the model away to a station hugging ship is unnacceptable."
6/26/2010,"well i dunno. if it's space worthy (i.e. not a novelty gank-me ship), then there should be bpos on the market. or at least some way to acquire more then the one each of us gets."
6/26/2010,/supportedbecause i dont want to see that beautifull ship model go to waste as one time only gift that no one will ever use coz its unique.
6/26/2010,how about redeeming it...... outside of a market hub?crazy i know!
6/26/2010,"the primae should be kept as it is, no bpo of it should be necessary.but a salvaging ship based on its hull is an intriguing idea and i support the reuse of the work the art department has put on it for a variant on it."
6/26/2010,ore lp store is good enough for me.
6/26/2010,"prior to knowing actual stats, if the ships is a true industrial(aka useful in some manner to industry other than gimmicks) it needs to be replaceable. industry has enough issues with keeping its stuff in one piece(highsec bot gankers who don't actually differentiate between players and bots, hulkageddon 1-3, now w/ even more backing, general low/null d-baggery) without having to worry about novelty gankers blowing up their ships for the km in addition to the rest.so, depending on actual layout, it needs to be able to do one of the following: fit a tank and cloak + haul fit w/ lp bpcs available to replace it or if it's basically a defenseless wreck-in-waiting, it needs a bpo if it serves any actual functionality. as has been stated numerous times, any novelty ship that undocks is basically a floating gank target, and no amount of defense will help it."

6/26/2010,"so what's your solution. we've heard your whine that people are playing in ways that you dont like. what do you want the csm to ask ccp to do about it? just saying ""i want space and can't get any! fix it!"" isn't good enough. this folder isn't supposed to be for people to baw about things they dont like, it's supposed to be where people put forward proposals.as i said before: the nature of the space dictates the politics. there already exists space where you can do the no huge powerblocs thing. it's called curse. it's called stain. it's called outer ring. it's npc sov space where anyone can set up their little operation and go ahead and play the game.even more, it's called w-space. remember that? when ccp added almost 2,500 new systems that give you exactly what you say you ask for: space that's impossible to powerbloc.so why aren't you in those areas, playing the way you want? seems to me that this isn't about you playing the game the way you like - there are thousands of systems that could give you exactly what you claim to want. it's about stopping other people playing in ways you dont like.i'll repeat the question you evaded:why should ccp tell people that they've been building the wrong kind of sandcastles in sovereign space? how is that a sandbox game?"
6/26/2010,"you finished sabotaging this most legitimate concern thread, or do i memo deborahfromengineering, the 120kg part time wrestling nerd with a mean streak?here is another reason why peace is unsavoury in eve, it allows arms stockpiling.i think we all agree that the one thing that makes even blobs seem reasonable is the heavier capital and super-capital blobs .. guess what human trait supported by which mechanic (or lack thereof) allows for those?@musical fist: ask a moderator to move your thread to ""features and ideas"" until you can couple the issue with a few potential solutions .. makes for a much stronger case when presented here."
6/26/2010,"well when 0.0 becomes one gigantic nap i will bump this thread and explain what the problem is again, im sure the way things are going that this will happen within 90 days.oh and no this isnt a what if scenario, anyone who has been playing this game long enough knows that eventually that will happen, this time last year more than 70% of 0.0 was controlled by nc and naps honestly if bob never returned and if dominion never came out 0.0 would have been goons nc drones and providence by now.butterfly effect is nice but at the end of the day this is a game not reality stop comparing 0.0 to rl just because i promote warfare in 0.0 doesnt mean i want someone to kill off nato edit - fyi dominion already changed how alliance built their sand castle, almost every patch theres a change to how you do it :p"
6/26/2010,why does 0.0 have to always be at war? if he residents out there want to be friendly to each other and work together it is their sandbox and they should be allowed. there does not always have to be war guys.
6/26/2010,answer the question: what's your proposal? what do you expect ccp to do?
6/26/2010,"they have come up with a alternative 0.0 experience for people who don't want blobswormhole's and worhole pos's etc.the qen gave some stats on their growing use.if wormholes are missing something 0.0 has (other than blobs) they could be tweaked, or additional breeds of wormholes could be developed to meet that need.maybe a different type of wormhole that could accomadate a bit bigger corporation? ways for players to get a bit more control of where or when entrances spawn? ideas would take some parsing out...the deetails really matter, but the first question would be , whats the goal?"
6/26/2010,"as i said in my first post, a revamp on how diplomacy works in general, right now theres no limits so 0.0 success is all about quantity truly.i also said 'i currently have no solution in fixing this without nerfing a amjor powerbloc but would like for ccp / csm to have this as one of the main focuses' that was the whole point.honestly malganis if you arent going to read the thread whats the point in replying, no wonder you got betrayed by the lich king"
6/26/2010,"new sovereignity mechanics failed horribly at making controlling tons of empty space less lucrative.at least make npc 0.0 more easily accessible. now certain npc 0.0 areas are actually deep inside ""power block"" space making them less ""free"" space. not to mention all bubblecamps and whatanot you need to pass first. it's not like it's impossible to move there but compared to low sec leap in effort is bigger than would feel logical.i see only one thing stopping ""hoarding"" the space and thati s making logistics (over long distances/large areas) require a lot of more effort."
6/26/2010,"precisely, and malcanis, feel free to stop repeating the idea that this thread is useless. you've managed to produce some of the least valuable posts in this thread so-far. take some time to evaluate what's being said before you come to quip that nobody understands 0.0 as you do. i've been a proud (not so much recently) member of the nc for a long time, and i am quite familiar with the politics, mechanics, and issues that have created what we're experiencing today.laechyd has the crux of it. in a nut-shell, sov mechanics need to change. sov space should support more pilots, sov holdings need to be scaled back (via making them harder to maintain) to allow more players to live in nullsec, and new players coming in should have more options than the 1 or 2 npc regions that aren't regularly blockaded by alliances. wh space is -not- what people are looking for. wh space is nullsec for hermits and people who want to play in a very small group, or solo."
6/26/2010,"how do you expect ccp to ""fix"" the way players work with each other?it's ""malcanis"". i presume you're being funny and clever or something in your opinion with your wow reference, whatever it means."
6/26/2010,"are you just reading your own posts? player relations isn't something ccp or the csm can do anything about, obviously, but thanks for the continued droning of that tired tangent. obviously the problem lies with sov mechanics."
6/26/2010,"doesnt matter how many ways you ask it, the question has already been answered"
6/26/2010,"good study and analyze.few possibilities still exist to reduce nap in game. make the nap really expensive, like a harsh rent, price could be based on the pilots number and not paid by alliances but by members, like a personal bill. (yes so you pay to have friends ig too )if nap is revised so wardec must have to. no ideas about this tho. a system based on free wardec ? whatever the solution, it must be revised...o/"
6/26/2010,"i'm interested in this magical sov mechanic you have in mind that will stop players working together. please give more details.or, you know, any."
6/26/2010,1
6/26/2010,supportednicely formulated too
6/26/2010,"yes agreed, and points taken about ships moving about, tnats common. but seriously something needs to be done. i wouldnt mind if they were quite harmless ships but they are quite decent pvp ships also. having a specilised cloaked gang is as state formiddable, arazu, rapier, stealh bomber, covert ops, etc all with specialities that in a gang is quite crazy. ewar, webs, drones, bombs and on top of that they can cloak sit in systems for hours and just pop up whenever, also they are fast ships!! jesus what more do you want.. you got almost complete invulnerability and firepower and undetectable...on their own fair enough they arent that much of a problem but a small gang as shown well your pretty screwed and there is nothing you can do about it...awesome sandbox game....i believe everything should have some counter and cloakies have none at all!"
6/26/2010,"the moment they want to do something other than staying cloaked, they become vulnerable.you can't do much within stations either -- but you're not going to complain about ships in stations, are you?another misconception wrongly associated to cloaking is to talk about situations where a gang of cloaked ships is the opponent of single ships. you can not really blame getting outnumbered on cloaking. getting outnumbered is always a strategic fail or mistake, not really caused by the cloaked ships' existence.know your enemies or get killed. it's as easy as that.if you'd compare opposing fleets with equal number of ships, one side cloaking, one not, the cloaking ones might have the element of surprise, but there might be one extra gun or launcher per ship on the other side. how unfair is that!on top of all: if you claim dominance in a system and don't manage to uncloak at least one opponent ship within a fleet of plenty of cloaking ships: there goes your dominance. space is not your space if you can not control it. you always can train covert ops yourself, btw. you can spy on covert ships uncloaking here or there. game rules should not support lazyness."
6/26/2010,"there's some tactics you can use to kill them but you have to be experienced and have some luck.one of them is the log on trap. if you can scramble one or 2, just give the go to your log on buddies and have fun killing them. you will see the river of tears flowing. something like ""f u logon trap...your cheating blah blah blah""hehe. of course thats only the basics but you get the idea. sometimes it works other times it doesn't. in anycase if they don't want to fight, move on."
6/26/2010,xd haha.. thats too funny. now.. where is my launcher =^.^=
6/26/2010,"i want a secret frozen cow corpse level instead. ""stone leg""originally made out of wood, this artifact became stone after centuries of time passing by.amarrian libraries date it back to ancient tristram space age.rumors say it once had the power to open portals to secret worlds.moo! moo! lol"
6/26/2010,"let me start by saying i don't spend that much time in 0.0, i do however pass through to do stuffs occasionally. anyway:something has always bugged me whenever i visit npc 0.0. the stations are wrong: for example, sansha's nation stations are amarr or caldari. distinct lack of spikes is bad. however, there are models in game that could be utilised.first time i went to curse, i hoped i'd see some stations a bit like the art from this chron i left disappointed.heck, there are even actual blood raider station models around (amarr stations with a different texture, but they're there). why are none of these used?i propose that ccp release and utilise some of the unused station models for pirate station. would add to depth/immersion/sexiness of the game.also: khanid stations <3"
6/26/2010,signed x10 times. i 've been saying this for a while. we have the damn models. it can't be that hard to swap them out.

6/26/2010,"extremely short: let electronic assault ships use cov ops cloaks... since theyre basically supposed to be mini recons, i would love to let them use cov ops cloaks..."
6/26/2010,"awesome idea, and while you're at it, give freighters cov ops cloaks, cause they're supposed to be giant blockade runners."
6/26/2010,"the solution to an underpowered class of ships is not always a covops cloak. it's worked for bombers and blockade runners, but i'm reluctant to extend it far past that. black ops maybe, but that's the limit. they're too common, and they ought to be rarer, not thrown around on every class going."
6/26/2010,eas need a little ehp buff to bring them from flimsy to af level. thats all they need. covop cloak is not the solution for them as they still would pop too easily.
6/26/2010,"they gave cov ops cloak for blockade runners and bombers, wouldn't hurt much more to give them also for freighters and eas anyhow eas could use some kind of tanking bonus i.e. sig radius bonus for mwd. or then more resists or whatsoever."
6/26/2010,"we hereby ask ccp to implement qa measures to identify single points of possible failure (or delay) in their communication chains towards the end users, both for sending and receiving direction, both for nodes and links alike!if single entities along a path might block or delay the communication or escalation of issues - without any option to e.g. speed up escalation or options to petition any decisions made along the path (no matter which direction and at which level) to have them at least cross checked by another entity - valuable information gets lost or delayed.problems of the communication chain in the end unavoidably do lead to quality problems and user dissatisfaction.some examples:my mac client still is crashing on every exit. it takes ccp longer than half a year to make an application exit gracefully? c'mon! did ccp at least recognize the problem? should i file a proposal after having filed a bug report? on playerside it is not 100% clear which bugs are recognized by ccp. the communication is lacking, resulting in loads of duplicate bug reports or in the worse case no bug report at all.assembly hall -"
6/26/2010,"yes also idk if this is the rite thread for it..but first assembly arrays should have a more specific text on what it can build exactly(imo)and 2nd with eve becoming more player run why cant we build pos structures in our pos's...i spent all kinds of isk and structures i dont need (atm ne way)to try and build structures i need if that makes sense,,ie i thought an assembly array:( mobile assembly facility where modules can be manufactured.) would be used to build a ship array..nope...so i go out and purchase a component assembly array which yea it says:(a mobile assembly facility where construction components such as capital ship, tech ii and hybrid (tech iii) components of all sorts can be manufactured.)so come on csm lets get this done : )(btw i do vote)hopefully ccp will let us build our structures w/o paying npcs anymore"

6/26/2010,and forgot to give support for my own idea ;)
6/26/2010,because adding something else to the node that it has to query the database on continously is a good way to address lag? m'ok.

6/26/2010,"ccp already has a pretty clear stance on sp buying, i'd say."
6/26/2010,"um, they already have?"
6/26/2010,"sounds like the craptastic political campaigns where a ludicrous allegation is made and taking the baffled silence of the other party as ""proof"" of its veracity stuff one can do with a ""sp pool tool"":- track sp that should have been awarded if servers didn't barf thus preventing proper skill changing.- instate an sp swap out thing where xx amount is removed from one skill and placed into another (will probably be hamstrung like neural remaps).- allow new characters, who often have no idea what the hell is going on, to correct mistakes made while under the influence of the 'shroud of noobness'."
6/26/2010,"ccp has already stated their stance on the matter (by two different devs no less). just because ccp has said it isn't going to happen doesn't mean trolls will stop posting threads about it, because that's what trolls do. supporting only because i want to see ccp lock all those stupid threads so we can get back to our usual forum whining."
6/26/2010,i'm glad atleast one person could get to the gist of what i'm trying to say

6/26/2010,"i feel since naps and blobs are the only two words that describe 0.0 anymore we should reward them (i expect nc and nc alts to give me lots of thumbs up)powerblocks - alliances will now be allowed to join powerblocks these powerblocks work much like alliances however are a group of alliances instead of corpspacts - based on your political methods your powerblock will be given a title.for exampleempire with bombs / bubbles - this 0.0 territory is the equivalent of empire with bombs / bubbles, concord will be blues & pets, any hostility here will get you blobbed by concord pets bluesthese pacts will be based on your play stylenow for the benefitsthere will now be an ingame political map much like verites where you can set your own tag / pin, doing so will alert people who wish to visit (like theres anything else people can do in 0.0).for example""dont attack us or we will get our 30k friends on you""or""we got here by only paying isk to that guy""this will benefit anyone who wishes to pvp visit.since combat is something naptrains dont approve of because well they will lose space the second they reset everyone i figured we should allow gate guns and station guns.this will in return prevent the roams which funny enough cause soo many problems too :s.in short 0.0 should be a place people go to macro rat only as there isnt going to be any sov wars anymore or generally anything else, this in return will increase the population in 0.0"
6/26/2010,a nice little +1 to my eve-search post count before this lovely thread gets locked.

6/26/2010,i found one of those websites that sells the macro to these macro mining scumbags. how do i report it to ccp as i imagine the sites that sell the macros are not legal.

6/26/2010,"oh, it was just a spoon? and here i had in my mind that she was throwing the pointy cutlery. probably better this way, but certainly less entertaining."
6/26/2010,"there is no spoon.also, to everyone who voted for ankh: told you so. :smug:"
6/26/2010,"now, when you say she threw a spoon, do you mean she playfully lobbed it in humorous annoyance, or she out and out hurled it like she was trying to knock somebody out?"
6/26/2010,"it's up to her to justify her behavior, but i daresay it wasn't 'playful'."
6/26/2010,"if ank threw something at someone in a public meeting out of anger, i'll be the first to call for her to step down. if this does turn out to be true, then i'll also call for sokratesz to resign. his continued pursuit of a personal vendetta while on the csm is immature, unprofessional, distracting, and disturbing. if a real problem like this arose, then it should be dealt with in a professional manner. spreading rumours is not acceptable behaviour. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
6/26/2010,lol. personal vendetta? i liked her a lot more than i had expected and i merely reported on what happened. stop seeing things that aren't there.

6/26/2010,"for a moment there, i very nearly thought words had failed me. it was frightening. but it was also a false alarm. allow me to simply state that if you cannot understand the difference between criticizing another member of the csm and throwing a spoon at one, then you are simply beyond help. sokratesz is well within his rights, both as a player and as a member of the csm, to criticize a colleague he considers to be incompetent. ankh, however, is most certainly not within her rights to start throwing silverware. that is behavior one would expect from a child having a temper tantrum, not an elected official."
6/26/2010,"lengthy explanation is, after consideration, unnecessary. tl;dr: i didn't get a spoon in the face, a spoon was thrown at me across the table as an attention grabber. no kitten were harmed.i blame lack of sleep for bad judgement on long rant.will have a lengthy debate with myself tomorrow morning to see if rant is justified and/or productive."

6/26/2010,"--- rage post deleted ---update: so...i admit to having lost what little sense of humor i have in my original rage-post here. while i realize the original post is quoted in all its glory elsewhere in this thread, i decided--after a few days' consideration"
6/26/2010,"there's nothing inherent in this that demonstrates that the csm can't function professionally. in point of fact, noting that a member behaves in a childish manner and throws temper tantrums (complete with pitching silverware) points out that member's behavior, only. and her voters as well as the rest of eve have a right to know that this sort of stuff is going on. it's actually a bit disconcerting that your response is to be annoyed that people reported what went on. don't you think that the eve playbase deserves to know who's on the csm and what its issues are?if you chucked a spoon at someone would it be news? maybe, maybe not. it probably would if you were developing a noticeable history of being difficult to work with and pulling childish stunts when you don't get your way.it's also odd to call this a ""witch hunt"". that implies that the situation is baseless and anybody is just casting around for a scapegoat. quite the contrary, it seems that your objection is that the facts are 100% accurate and everything said has been truthful, but you believe it paints the csm in a poor light. it doesn't. it paints one single csm member in a poor light, based on that member's verified actions.the person who put you into an unpleasant situation is the one whose behavior has sparked this discussion, not the people who mentioned that behavior. the attitude ""don't talk about the systemic misbehavior of one of the csm members, it makes us look bad!"" will make the csm look bad. forthright and honest discussion would be quite a different issue.p.s. look at your last statement. if someone had done something defensible and understandable, would there be any reason that you'd have to instruct them not to respond? at the point where a csm member becomes a liability, it is odd that the focus is on those who discuss that rather than the person herself. if an mp wore clown shoes to meetings and threw pies at people he didn't like, it would make him look very bad. if the reaction of the rest of parliment was to chastise people for talking about it rather than censuring him for his behavior, then and only then would they look bad."
6/26/2010,"you know,once upon a time when the csm was introduced people saw it as a free trip to iceland, others saw it as a way to get the inside scoop ahead of time, and yet others saw it as ccp marketing (which to players has a different meaning then what until this csm many ccp staff considered it to be).over time, that changed, because of striking a balance between the entertainment of the elections, and getting to work when those were over. after all, accountability is not something which solely applies to ccp.personally i don't give a **** about preferences in game play, political backgrounds or anything like that, because the csm concept is pretty much the only thing that has a potential to have a solid impact.i couldn't care less about personal differences, or private petty emo. i really have zero interest or feel for pve or anything related, but for the process that does not matter one bit.but what i do hope, is that people realise that until the next elections begin, there is a lot of work to be done if the last resort of this csm concept is to have an impact on ccp, on all levels, especially those levels where the decisions are made. yeah, we all like the gossip, the stories, the entertainment, but given the state of the game itself in being in shambles of half finished content and feature sets, the future for the product shown by product marketing, the abyssmal performance of the game, and the enormous divide between players and those who make the calls and do not play themselves, you would think that people would be able to think for a moment. especially those who stepped up to get to work, because they told their voters to care and safeguard their fun & comfort zones.tbh, as a player, i would expect the csm members to work as a team, to sort out balances and differences, to keep finding best practices as well as compromises in order to keep their noses pointing the same way.i don't need to hear or read this kind of ****, regardless of actualy or factuality, it is misplaced, without useful focus, and it diminishes the csm as a whole.why? because it's the last straw to get through to ccp. because you signed up to work for it. because you committed yourself to be there for eve as a whole and the people who voted for you.what do you want, honestly. next business monday the people at ccp who make the calls, visit the forums because through a lot of concerted effort and work they have actually woken up, they see stuff like this and wave the last week aside again. ""k guyz, was a tough week with those guys in iceland, but lookie, they can't keep it together, alright, so what else can we introduce for the winter expansion which lacks pvp content, has tons of farmville in it, and makes people stay less long in eve?""you know, us players, we can fool around and do stuff, csm members, they have a responsability they themselves chose to take on."
6/26/2010,stop wasting time on ankh and work on real matters :p all of csm members were elected there to represent certain groups of voters not **** up with little matters like someone having wrong opinions or whatsoever.
6/26/2010,"except this does not diminish the csm as a whole. that's the whole point, that most of the csm is working diligently at doing their assigned task. there should be full transparency and honest reporting. otherwise the csm looks bad. saying that the csm looks bad for being open and honest about what's going on is nonsensical."
6/26/2010,"i'm a what most around here would call a noob, not having played that long. i like this game, but it really is broken in so many places that it just ain't funny. but damn, it is worth it. i'm not a game designer, it's all magic to me. but one thing is really clear here: when people differ in opinions, but are required to work together for the sake of people behind them and all of them, even if they differ in principles, you always take care to tackle the differences and compromises internally. to the outside, you always operate as a united front. if you don't want to get results because you don't care yourself, then let it be every man for his own entertainment. make room then for people who do."
6/26/2010,"no, you really don't always operate as a ""united front"".that sort of behavior makes you look really, really bad when things screw up. actively opposing transparency and accountability makes organizations look bad. actively having a commitment to deal openly and honestly with issues and fix them quickly does not. and it looks especially bad to actively campaign against honestly relating facts to the playbase. why would it have made the csm look bad if we knew that each and every single member was diligently working to improve things, except for one? up until now we had a story where one csm member was unable to act like an adult. now we have a statement which heavily suggests that the proper course of action would have been a coverup and for the voters to be none the wiser, come the next election, as to what's actually going on."
6/26/2010,"no amount of trying to spin **** as transparancy is going to make anything of it sound reasonable, since these guys are the only ones ccp actually might listen to.transparancy, read the meeting minutes, condensed or raw. everything is in there.i got to agree with one of the guys who posted earlier, with this personal crap, on monday the ccp ceo reads all this and draws his conclusions, great a ton of work and effort wasted."
6/26/2010,"sokratesz and meissa, i hope you are proud that you dust undid everything you accomplished.the only liability to the csm is you two with your unprofessional childish bull**** vendetta againt ankh. please just resign.trolling removed. zymurgist"
6/26/2010,"are we back at the standard ank-ploy, those who point out the facts about her that are unflattering are trolls? i think most of us have had enough of that game.in any case, transparency rather obviously means more than the simple minutes that are put out for meetings. this is both obvious and very, very basic. there is more that goes on in an organization than what is recorded by a secretary.don't call the facts ""spin"". an organization that conducts itself with honesty and openness doesn't seek to hide the fact that one of its members is unable to properly do their job simply because it's not on the record.and you may hold ccp in such low regard that you think they're morons who live by the fallacies of composition and division, but if they've got half a brain in their heads they'll judge the summit by what was actually accomplished and not by the misbehavior of one (and only one) member. the entire reason that the csm was formed in the first place was that, when faced with the misbehavior of one of its members, instead of prompt and transparent action, ccp tried to prevent a ""united front"" and lost almost all credibility for years. the lesson to be learned is not that ccp should've just backed t20 even more or that kugu really was the badguy for pointing out the facts, but that secrecy and bull**** 'solidarity' is self-defeating when obvious mistakes have been made.the lesson is not, ""well, you just need to be even more dedicated to closing ranks and being even more tight-lipped when obvious problems come up.""the story yesterday was ""one lone csm member repeatedly behaving badly."" the story today is ""some elements of the csm want to keep the playerbase in the dark about misbehavior going on in the csm so they can preserve their image rather than achieving transparency when dealing with the playerbase.""this is not an improvement."
6/26/2010,you guys really are doing a good job of making this whole circus look like a joke.what is it actually you guys are trying to achieve?inappropriate comment removed. zymurgist
6/26/2010,"vittorian: you have a bit of a point. the problem is there's no real way to shut ank up. for better or worse, a bunch of the playerbase elected someone to the csm who either can not or will not behave as an adult in a cooperative fashion to get things done. it's also important for the playerbase to know how and why the csm is working a certain way, and if there's possible trouble getting things done because of one single member, again and again, then we deserve to be told and not have that covered up. when you have an mp coming into parliament every session and throwing pies at people he doesn't like, the correct reaction is to take him to task and not to try to hush it up. because once it gets out now you don't have a rogue member of an assembly who looks like an idiot, you have a systemic problem in the assembly and everybody looks culpable in the aftermath if not the commission.a lone individual doesn't make an organization look bad unless the organization condones that behavior.nobody (rational) would have a problem if the csm doesn't try to hush up ank's behavior and, instead, censured her and/or reports the facts and then lets the record try to speak for itself while they get on with work. the csm as a whole wouldn't look bad at all, they'd look good and it would be clear that one bad element was unable to act properly but the rest were doing fine. it wouldn't be a circus at all. of course it's getting close to it at this point (especially if the csm can't even decide that they won't tolerate ank's bull**** and will, instead, fight over whether or not they should try to keep ank's bull**** quiet). and, of course, the words ""i told you so"" are kinda cool but it sucks to know that this was so blindingly obvious and predicable. ah well. troll:obvious alt-troll is obviously alt-trolling.ccp is not going to scrap all the csm's proposals and input because ank can't behave like a grownup, much less because someone else related the 100% true and accurate facts. and you know it. stop trolling.this ""ayieeeee, now the csm is undone! not because a member is behaving badly, but because other people commented on it!!!"" simply does not fly. you're not fooling anybody.and seriously, enough of your trolling. enough of your trolling. enough. that's it. no more of this ""the facts are trolling! damn the facts, damn them!!!"" no more calling relating facts ""smears"" or a ""vendetta"". yes yes, reality has a clear anti-ank bias, damn reality right to hell!this is the same exact trolling we've seen since the campaign, and it's idiotic. you're like a pack of scientologists. you can't face the facts, so when they're pointed out you just go into rabid attack dog mode and angrily gum the ankles of those pointing out the facts. no defense, always attack. if someone points out that ank is unbalanced and cannot behave like an adult? why... then they must not be behaving like adults!we all know you don't really believe it, and you're not fooling anybody. at all."
6/26/2010,"finny,stop trolling man. if you like the game, and want it to perform, you'll give a proper process like a csm that has a job to do, room to do its job. if you don't, by all means continue as current.no, now don't run off texting and trying to think of more things to throw in the cocktail. there's no room for the drunk cocktail, it's business now.when the next elections come, we can go ape****, sure. right now, like one of the other posts mentioned if you want csm to work, they have to take it on professionally. playing emo politics doesn't match with that."
6/26/2010,"use a gank of cloaking ships, problem solved"
6/26/2010,"agreed, plus if you've got that many skillpoints you should be more than experienced to get your pod out in low sec (with the exception of lag) when losing your frigate, 0.0 i can understand especially with a bubble."
6/26/2010,"there are alot of people who don't know how to use frigates properly, and don't even bother looking at frigs. it is somewhat the current mindset of a lot of starting eve player to get into ""bigger"" ships as fast as possible, and they will usually neglect the frigate class after a week or two & hop into a cruiser. this mindset still exists with alot seasoned eve players, who will stick to bigger ships because they are more shiney/have more dps etc. before i started my life of piracy, i never really bothered about frigs since i was using cruisers & bc sized ships for whatever i needed doing, and i never even bothered looking into frigates as a pvp ship. once i joined a pirate corp, i soon discovered that a well (manually) piloted & fitted frig can take on quite alot of things, and in a larger group they can kill alot of things, up to lone bs's etc. i love my ac punisher, and i suggest that the op should try some more frig pvp, since it is very fun, and a cheap way of pvp'ing. and i can also ensure the op that frigates are absolutely not useless or on the verge of extinction, and i really do not need to see anything changed to them. and even that, i consider most of your arguments to be quite.. invalid.for one - big guns vs. frigate - learn to fly manually. dont go straight at a bs, or any ship. ever. you have the speed advantage in a frig, use it, and get under his guns.energy nuets - fly ac fit frigs. either ac punisher or rifter. autocannons do not use cap, and you can dedicate your cap to your ab or rep. if timed correctly you can keep them running without issue.drones - thats gotta be a joke. unless its ecm drones. the one of the first things you ever learn when pvp'ing is to have one overview tab dedicated to drones, & drones die fast once you shoot them. keep orbiting your enemy, shoot his drones, and then kill him. if he uses ecm drones against you & is able to get jam cycles on you, you'll be screwed usually, no matter what size ship you fly.so mr op, i suggest, please, rediscover the awesome ship class called a frigate."
6/26/2010,so what did the non-ankh csm member accompolish ?
6/26/2010,"this statement captures sokratesz' problem. he wants to egg on this dispute, while sidestepping responsibility for it. one of the features of leadership, sokratesz, is learning to take responsibility not only for your own actions, but for the actions of others working in your name or on your behalf. it is both a matter of honesty and maturity. if you cannot take such responsibility, then you should stop participating in these threads, and ask your friends to move onto something more constructive. the vast majority of us do not want to see this childish behaviour from you or anyone else on the csm. please try to keep this in mind before you write your next post. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
6/26/2010,"i wasn't chosen to be a leader, and i will not adjust my behaviour based solely on your opinion. i know very few of the other people that are anti-ankh, which given my forum history is rather characteristic of the situation, while the ones defending her are easily counted and classified. i felt that the first csm 5 summit has been constructive, although i remain skeptical towards ccp's future projects. more on that later."
6/26/2010,the sad thing about ankh is that her campaign of lies and spam pulled votes away from better but less ruthlessly self-promoting candidates who might have genuinely promoted the issues she claims to represent.the only issue she actually cares about is fluffing her cv.
6/26/2010,"delilah is just a troll, desperate to support and/or draw attention away from ank any possible way, even if it's patently absurd. sok, we are to believe, is now responsible for ank's behavior and the mere act of reporting on what she does is a grave breach. because, of course, the only professional thing to do is keep ank's voters ignorant of her mental instability and manifest unsuitability for work on the csm and, instead, just shut up about it all. deliliah isn't even a good troll. more the pity, as she might at least work to be amusing i guess."
6/26/2010,"aren't you the guy who takes offence to the idea that anyone anti-ankh is a troll? if so, you'd do well to avoid saying the same thing in the other direction."
6/26/2010,"indeed. i would do well not to say that anybody who supports ank is a troll. of course, i've never said anything like that, so i'm doing pretty well on that count. i have pointed out that deliliah's pattern of habitual dishonesty, deception and distortion marks her as a troll. that she happens to be a rabid pro-ank partisan is orthogonal to that."
6/26/2010,"switching forums for such things is handy, you claimed same thing on tweakers, where an easy search on eve-search showed you made 10+ ankh hate posts in a couple of days, let alone the amount you made totally.ankh made many good proposals, deal with it. which one of her proposals was bad? why should i care if she plays puzzle pirates, hello kitty or whatever other game, she has made good proposals, i support her. you shot down fw improvements, i dont support you."
6/26/2010,"how many of those were in relevant threads on eve-o? how many were directly aimed at her and not at that raving lunatic, natana? (eveger)claiming that her good proposals outweigh the numerous bad things only shows that you are willingly casting a blind eye to the latter."
6/26/2010,"many of ank's proposed fw ""improvements"" are simply foolish and progress from a potent lack of understanding of how eve works. my favorite example is her suggestion that people need an incentive for pvping. evidently somehow the entire rest of eve manages to pvp because it's fun, it generates killmails, and ships drop loot. but ank with her lifetime total of, what, a whole half dozen kills believes that the devs need to do something to encourage pvp in fw."
6/26/2010,"i dont care she likes puzzle pirates or whatever, i just look at what she did in the past as csm member and what she promised to do in the future. and i liked that, and from the topics she made it looks like she sticks to those promises. she makes good proposals, so i support her, and i really dont care about all the smear crap arround it.i did the same with you, you had no promises for future and nothing in the past that was different from what every csm member did.(btw, and i just support her ideas, it isnt like i think she is always right, for example the other election she was in i thought her ideas were horrible (pirate party for national elections), but not for csm elections).three people do it for loot, and everyone who does it for kms is sad (yeah i know roughly half the pvp population does it for that).strange to see how someone who barely pvps (i suppose you do everything in eve), apparently understands it better than you do. some incentive for fw pvp would make it much more fun, which is why people would want to do it. she just says she wants pvp in fw plexes/missions encouraged, that can be done in many ways."
6/26/2010,boy do i have a surprise for youedit: here it is
6/26/2010,"no, that's the point. it's an opinion that shows someone simply does not understand the game. the very fact that anybody think that fwers need even more of an incentive is loopy. literally each and every single other pvper in all of eve finds enjoyment in pvping even without special rewards. but that's not good enough for some folks? riiiiight.and not only do fwers not actually need anything special, they already have many bonuses far and away more than what all other pvpers have. to start with, they get eternal, free wardecs. they can go hunting anywhere in new eden for 100% free. they also can earn lp's redeemable for valuable loot just by running basic missions. the idea that, on top of that, fwers need to be held by the hand and patted gently on the head by ccp so that they'll pvp is the kind of thinking that shows folks simply don't get pvp."
6/26/2010,"i disagree slightly. there are a lot of bugs in fw atm, if they were fixed there would be a lot less to cry about."
6/26/2010,"certainly, fw is buggy. but fixing the structure of fw doesn't give folks more of an incentive to find ways to gank each other. i played in fw for the first few weeks after it was released and i went out looking for fights as often as i could. are there elements of fw which could use some work? sure. but is it ccp's responsibility to ensure that players shoot at each other? no."
6/26/2010,"she threw a spoon to catch someones attention? i am shocked and appaled, this will be dealt with immediatly if people are going to make topics (in oope then) everytime i throw stuff at them to catch their attention it is going to be kinda crowded.fw missions have nothing to do with pvp (what ankh wants to change afaik), so i dont see how that is related to anything.they cant go hunting everywhere 'free', since faction police attacks them (granted filled with bugs) when they enter highsec space of another faction. and that doesnt add more than rvb, so isnt really that much of a bonus. the reason why i always have not been against special pvp rewards for fw (which granted are tough to balance and i think not that important, more 'help' to get relative even fights would do way more, which would be much harder to make without ruining the open element of eve), is that fw is the only thing where you dont get rewards for pvp besides fun.high sec wardeccers / pirates get loot from their targets/ransoms. that they blow everything up anyway and dont honor ransoms so no one pays them is their problem. and before you say fw'ers get the same, fw'ers get opponents in low sec who are almost always also pvp fitted. unlike high sec wardeccers and pirates they get pvp fitted opponents (granted crappy fitted often, but usually not loot to write home about). and unlike high sec wardeccers they dont do it with concord protection if they are in their normal habitat, low sec.then the other group pvp'ers are 0.0 people. there we also got the 'pirating' part, killing their anomaly runners, etc, which is same as above (really not that many fw'ers run anomalies in low sec). besides that we got the sov fighting, where the pvp'ers do get a bonus if they win, sov. or worse, moon mining which means enormous incomes because they won fights.tl;dr, i dont think giving isk rewards or similar things for pvp'ing is the way to go, however right now they do get much less in return than the 'average' pvp'er."
6/26/2010,"i don't know about you, but if i want to grab someone's attention, i say their name, especially in a professional setting (we may be players, but we're dealing with a company). that kind of action is symptomatic and is being used as a ""funny/facepalming"" anecdote describing the kind of attitude we have to put up with from her part."
6/26/2010,"wrong. they're missions that place people who are wardec'd within the sphere of influence of those who are at war with them. wrong again. highsec, lowsec and nullsec, fw people can go hunting and have many war targets to shoot wherever they wish. and they don't have to pay a single isk for that. fwers have more encouragement to pvp than anybody else in the entire game. and their rewards are exactly the same. the claim that fw is somehow underprivileged when it comes to pvp rewards makes no sense at all."
6/27/2010,bumping this because it shouldnt be falling off the front page
6/27/2010,back to the top.blasters and hybrids in general need help.
6/27/2010,"anyone look at the fitting requirements of medium blasters? look at the percentage of dps that ion does over electron blasters then compare that to the power grid too. same for neutron over ion. the dps goes up a little but the power grid requirement goes up by over 50% on each level.here is some info on medium blasters t2: (i think the numbers are right, correct me if i'm wrong)gun, power grid, damage modifierelectron, 105, x0.70 +50.48% +0.07%ion, 158, x0.75 +34.18% +0.07%neutron, 212, x0.80sorry my graph failed but i hope you can see the power grid jump in comparison to damage output.to go from electron to ion blasters the power grid goes up by 50.48% but the dps only goes up 7%. from ion to electron it is another 34.18% for another 7%could someone help me explain this better?"
6/27/2010,"just to let you know amarr and minmatar can also use drones, and some of them can use them just as well as a gallente blasterboat (the ones with no drone bonus). also the only time you outdamage those auto/pulse setups using faction close range is when you use neutrons with faction antimatter. also rails just suck even more then blasters.ps:high fitting requirments+low range+cap use+ammo use+fixed damage types+some tracking issues at optimal+10%-15% more dps=not worth it"
6/27/2010,supported
6/27/2010,"supported. i want to use blasters as a gallente pilot, but even on bonused ships they're outperformed by pulse lasers in nearly every situation."
6/27/2010,"supported. i would love to see buffs to destroyers. as a relatively new player i was quite sad to be told to completely skip the class. i didn't, because i loved the cormie hull (and the ability to have some salvaging ability on board while doing level 1s and 2s).in pvp destroyers should be something that frigates are afraid of. not so much that they can destroy fleets of them solo, but dangerous enough that they could kill frigates better than other frigates can."
6/27/2010,"strongly support removing learning skills.they add nothing positive to the game and add an unnecessary hurdle for new players to get into the game. i'll also say many of the people that want to keep features like learning skills represent a sickness in mmos... clinging to the idea that doing mindless unfun monotonous pointless tasks should be rewarded. i'm sure many developers love you, since it's not hard to add content that appeals to you, whether it be pressing a button one million times, killing a thousand sheep, or training pointless skills for a few months you'll love it... well, just so long as it promises to give you an edge over the other guy who isn't quite as lame as you to be wasting their time with such horrible gameplay. personally i hope you guys stop playing mmos and take up counting sand or something as a new hobby. that way developers will be compelled to actually make good games."
6/27/2010,"not supported. they aren't broken as long as you use them when needed and not front load 5/5. if you just train learning then yeah, that sucks....don't do that."

6/27/2010,"i prefer a salv version; but yes, ccp please seed bpc's for ore lp stores!"
6/27/2010,yay (signed) - at least release a bpo of a similar ship with the same hull. nobody will use it if there's not even a rare chance of producing a bpo
6/27/2010,"maybe ccp hasn't realized this yet but salvage and the rigs are a large part of this game. people have been asking for a salvaging ship for years because our alternatives are annoying to use... and i've used all of them and am at the point of considering using a t3 rigged and subbed for salvaging to take some headache out of looting.worthless free gift i care not for, i would have rather the time have been spent on a useful ship. this ship looks nice and i'd like to see a salvage variant on the market."
6/27/2010,"either a ship is rare (under 1000) or very rare (under 100) or it is everywhere (bpo).a ship that everybody gets once is just junk. complete and utter garbage. it is nothing really special because everyone gets one, yet it is nothing truly useful, since it can't be replaced reasonably.why add a well designed and cool looking ship to the game and then cripple it's usefulness?then there is also the gank factor. if ships can't be replaced, there will be a lot of ganks targeting them and that will hurt new players most, as older characters have the money to replace it if they want to, simply by buying it insanely overpriced via contract market. things that do more harm to the new player experience than the good they do to old player experience are not good for the game.why not add a bpc to the mining corps' loyalty stores, like with other faction ships?"
6/27/2010,"this.i would like a different skin for the seeded version, maybe a mark ii model with slightly different stats, but if the ship do what it is advertised for it would be interesting to have the bpo available or to have a bpc offer from the ore lp store."
6/27/2010,no. i look forward to the millions upon millions of tears come july 29th and beyond.
6/27/2010,"while the ""gift issue"" should be unique (or as unique as it can be while gifted to any and every eve active player...), i dont see why they shouldnt seed ""market issue"" bpos, with different colours and ****...even the zephir could have its niche if its built in numbers and not an irreplaceable collecting toy."
6/27/2010,yes seed bpo's / lp store bpc's and change the stats to something that is actually usefully 100m3 cargo is a joke
6/27/2010,"usefull ships should always be able to be built, and not saved in an hangar somewhere"
6/27/2010,"/signedif this was simply a neat little shuttle or a pleasure yacht, then making it a one-time gift makes sense.however, this appears to be a useful ship with a practical purpose. having a truly useful ship that can never be undocked for fear of imminent death is a bit of a cruel joke. :) this ship needs to be replaceable if you actually expect people to use it."
6/27/2010,"please seed as bpos in an lp store, or similar. otherwise nobody will be willing to risk flying their irreplaceable ship."
6/27/2010,"indeed, i would like to see a blueprint of this available somehow."
6/27/2010,"supported. additionally, i also advocate a similar approach with the zephyr.all the zephyr's i have i treat as collector's items. they don't get undocked, except in repackaged form in the cargohold of a well-tanked battleship. if there were bpos or loyalty point store bpcs, then i might actually use them for something."

6/27/2010,"hmm, i checked the ""pending ccp action"" list under b but didn't bother under s, so... ah, ego wins, i did it!my thread was a success!"
6/27/2010,100% support of this. the 5 at a time rule is horible and the lag is sick.
6/27/2010,any news/data on this topic from anybody?
6/27/2010,as i already stated if you remove the ability for large blue lists or give smaller gangs an in game advantage over small one all that will happen is diplomacy will go even more meta and people will just ignore standings in game. instead having each member remember a blue list of alliances not to shoot and organizing the large gangs you see now into many smaller gangs to abuse those bonuses. it will not stop people working together
6/27/2010,"you guys really must be skilled working offline, everytime theres no major conflict you can almost guarantee more than 80% of activity dies and the 20% that remain are macrosi suppose it doesnt really matter anymore, since no one would be stupid enough to go against 30k people overall (careless of their size or skill) we will just wait for you guys to quit the game from boredom againso i guess i dont really need a fix, naps seeled their own fate, which would explain why most alliances can only get 2.5% max of their total nap list in any given op nc - boring everyone to death in the north where activity is reduced to macro ratting"
6/27/2010,"it's worth remembering that at one time there was no such thing as ""blues"" and ""reds""; and why there are now.hint: metagaming, 3rd party software."
6/27/2010,"sure, this is true, so make rules to regulate the working.nap should be fat bills, for alliance, corporations and members, maybe some won't pay to be nap, so less nap in game.and war declarations and endings should be revised."
6/27/2010,"""theres 2 ways to skin a cat and more than one way in fixing the nap issue""but i am glad you are starting to agree theres a problem, only took you and ed three pages to agree"
6/27/2010,"i am certainly willing to concede that you have a problem. what i'm doing is questioning your assumptions; that ccp are responsible for player decisions; that there is no alternative to sov space; that there is no way for a small alliance to have sov because of the current sovereignty mechanics.if ccp removed the entire sovereignty structure and the ability to set standings of any kind you still would have powerblocks. and you still would not be able establish a new alliance without engaging in some diplomacy. just because a name is not listed at the top left corner of the screen does not mean a large, active and well equipped group of players (a.k.a. ""powerblock"") will not claim it. sov follows the power, not the other way around.ps incidentally, your political analysis of 0.0 is naive and oversimplified at best."
6/27/2010,"i'm agreeing with the people who are saying this is very very hard to actually solve this issue.people will tend to group up, especially if all your neighbours have already got themselves loads of allies already. it's just human nature.the only possible solution is to make it that space becomes more expensive to hold, with more of it destroyable by small gangs. that would mean that a smaller entity could just drive a larger but less skilled/determined/whatever entity out by making it a waste of time and money to hold the space.*however* that runs into it's own problems, so i'm not sure what can actually be done about this..."
6/27/2010,"yes, let's disperse people by increasing codependency. i'm sure that'll work.if you want to make it harder to accumulate large fleets you'll have to look at making new eden larger again by limiting portals and bridges while simultaneously making it possible to supply remote regions with hostiles in between. look at the logistical chokepoint that is tribute/vale for branch/tenal. it is downright impossible to live in tenal without controlling either trib or venal. dito for regions like period basis which you can not hold without controlling at least querious."
6/27/2010,itt the op is very bitter.
6/27/2010,"sov has nothing todo with this dominion proved that and in a way fixed sov, i didnt even mention sov being an issuethis is once again repeating myself so for those who have read and understood what the problem is theres no point reading on.@ malganis - the mechanics on how naping has gotten out of hand, you seem to be fixated on players aligning but dont get that im not against diplomacy.also i never even made a suggestion in this whole thread so saying ""if ccp removed the entire sovereignty structure and the ability to set standings of any kind you still would have powerblocks"" doesnt even make sense, you keep bringing sov into this thread when i have stated over and over i am not talking about sovbut its fine i found a nice lowsec constellation that gets more conflict than immensea has gotten in 4 years, i understand the minority of 0.0 would prefer to hold hands and have everything peaceful blue for all and are continuously working hard on achieving this.i just feel sorry for the people who have to go inactive immediately after major conflicts are over due to pure boredom for 9 - 12 months guess if anyone ever wonders how can a nap coalition of 30k+ members only get 300+ in fleet they now know.if anything this thread show shows how laughable 0.0 is, nc were already branded carebears because they think much like ed + his alts in this thread, but it seems no matter how far you move from the north you still have the same global naping goalsoh and sov follows those who have the most numbers and i guess those who can disband others the fastesttop 25 alliances by size, you will notice 10 (united front alliance for example who are part of nc too making it 11 :facepalm:) are naped by the nc they are marked red as they are the biggest abusers of diplomacy, theres obviously more naps but i figured i would pick 25, a nice number, ivy league is the only alliance that isnt part of any coalition.now because you are predictable, i am well aware a coalition is required to defend space, this isnt the first time i have screenshotted this list i did it about 3 months ago and the only colours i used were red, blue and green i think its obvious why.in the past year more so when dominion was announced members including yourself have repeatedly commented on how you would like people to leave empire and come to 0.0 space, to the point where majority agreed with their masters than 0.0 needed more people.also in the past year there has been countless amounts of complaints wars and drama which again you were even part of to stop naps and i guess revenge.based on comments research and how 0.0 is (general recruitment) alliances recruit just to be fatter than the other guy, more peons = more numbers, generic military thinking ignoring the fact that this is a game. you get members going inactive due to transitions and complete boredom and more people are recruited, grunts and peons get ordered and treated like stats however unlike rl get ****ed and either go inactive and leave and alliance recruit more.you now have a problem, your recruitment is tighter, invite only isnt bringing a lot in so the easiest cheap method is to nap everything in 50 jumps just to prevent any sov warfare, which is why every major conflict in 0.0 has always ended (assuming its a loss) in allies aka pets leaving the coalition and either joining later, defecting or just fail cascading.my point is simple not that you are capable of reading, change the way diplomacy works, dont stop it just change it because right now all that alliances are capable of doing are mass recruiting and napingthe way things are going unless one coalition quits the game (most likely due to boredom) each coalition will grow and grow and grow not like an army but more like a fungus, the whines about lag will continue and in 7 years we will have omg ccp fix lagg node cant handle 500k in local."
6/27/2010,"wow, you are literally the dumbest person i've ever seen on this forum.congrats, you just out-dumbed butter dog."
6/27/2010,"the fear in this thread spells out one thing and one thing only, the thought of not being able to blob if you take that away from any major alliance you will in effect make 0.0 all about skill, something that naps have lacked.i understand theres some great fcs and players who are incredibly skilled but for majority of people in 0.0 they are merely there to add to the already huge blob because theres no greater strategy than to blob.oh and that link i gave above, i singled out nc because they have the highest amount of napsso flame criticise and ***** in the end history and actions have proven time and time again that the key to 0.0 is to outblob the enemy which is funny since node crashing is really classed as meta gaming which is why newer alliances will never have a independent future in 0.0 unless this is changedsince this is the only strategy i guess i should just nap empire:facepalm: to the people who still dont get this or rather defending their land with meta gaming"
6/27/2010,"for the record myself and the ini guy are not agreeing with, just pointing out the logical fallacy your entire argument is based upon: that ccp should introduce game mechanics to punish large groups of people from working together.face it, it aint happening."
6/27/2010,"you can take ed away from goonswarm but you cant take goonswarm away from eddude i like diplomacy i have done nothing but compliment it, dont spin my **** makes you look weak and patheticpunish good one, large is an understatement dont you think?"
6/27/2010,you can try to twist my words however you want. doesn't make them any less true.edit: the more you post the more your intentions show to be entirely politically based.
6/27/2010,"as i said before due to sc no longer existing the ideas i was planning on suggesting would be completely anti nc, i did mention that this is the reason i couldnt post any of my ideas.if anything i have been against big lame naps (all of them) forever but sadly it seems theres only one coalition exercise mass naping so it is completely understandable why this thread went from anti naps to anti nc for in the end its the same thing no matter how anyone looks at it, however it wasnt my intention to make this political"
6/27/2010,"in what way could such a subject ever not be political? it's about the most political thing possible.so anyway, basically your thread isn't really anything to do with ccp or csm, but is just an impassioned plea for the members of the big alliances to cut it out please guys, you're spoiling it for lots of people, come on now, be reasonable"
6/27/2010,"so you're just crying that the nc survived the sc assault then? you haven't put forth any actual ideas beyond ""dont let massive powerblocs form"" or ""break them apart"". these aren't really csm issues, nor is this the forum for those failing to formulate even a basic concept of what they want to propose."
6/27/2010,"issue: make the naping abuse be a top priority for csm / ccp, that was the purpose of this thread i never said i would give ideas, what i wanted was a yay/nay on prioritising this since as it is a major thing that imo affects everyone which has been spiralling out of control for several years nowi repeatedly stated this over and over, the bolded part is what people are supporting or not supporting, is it really that difficult to read and that was in my first post.if you had read the rest of what i said i also stated that there was a 3 way nap issue which i later took back based on the changes in the south, my edits in my posts are spelling only but its all there (first one isnts even edited).also considering how i started this dont you think its more of 'aww bitter 0.0 vet wants 0.0 to be chaotic again so smaller alliances have a chance and theres more warfare' if anything this is more in favour of those who are bored in 0.0 (all sides might i add) and those who wish to go from empire to 0.0.this isnt the first time i have *****ed about this, there a thread months ago during the fountain invasion that said the exact same thing while it wasnt todo with supporting etc i was in favour of pl because 0.0 warfare itself is a disaster.which brings me to a new point, dont you think its funny how you immediately think this has something todo with sc which just shows how limited 0.0 is in terms of naps (assuming sc was a temp reset) controlled in a way by 3 people, diplomatic or ****ed upi have no personal issues with nc only the nap thing, a simple screenshot showed how 11/25 top alliances (in size) were part of nc and you think this is diplomacy hahaha"
6/27/2010,thanks for confirming you are posting in the wrong forum. here you go.
6/27/2010,"always one step ahead ;)oh and thats how i found out that vuk lau out of all people had blob warfare as one of his priorities to stop, ironic really isnt it the purpose of this thread fits best here and is here for a reason, i still wish to see who and wouldnt (with reason) it is the best section to discuss, i did consider sending this to f&i but since assembly hall strictly deals with csm it was no doubt the best place to be.if i wish to have my ideas reviewed etc (although its difficult considering the nap situation atm) i will reconsider f&i, until then this thread is perfect for this section much like the thread i linked you is best suited for jita talks section."
6/27/2010,yes but you miss the point(again). you are supposed to come here with formulated ideas that have already been put through the ringer and are ready to present to ccp. this is not such an idea.
6/27/2010,"my point was to outline or in this case point out in detail the problems with diplomacy and how it is abused, changing such a major part of the game cant just happen over night it also doesnt have one magical idea that will fix allhowever ccp / csms arent focusing (or at least havent stated it being a major priority) on this right now which again brings me to the point of this thread.some of my own ideas would fix the situation in the short term and i guess long term but in the long run could make other things worse, its a very important thing and right now my only aim is to have diplomacy get looked at more in depth.i have outlined the areas which are getting abused and pointed out facts and screenshots on how diplomacy has spiralled out of control, so this thread is fine as it is since the 'idea' is to look at diplomacy and what i am proposing is for them to 'look' at diplomacy and treat it as a major feature and give it a high priorityconsidering you have already agreed with me since i never gave any methods, (why people are convinced i did still confuses me) unless you are proving a point of being inconsistent i dont really know what else there is to discuss.oh and really talking about the thread being in the right or wrong place, seriously is that what we should be talking about :/"
6/27/2010,"oh and for the record in case you are convinced this is anti-nc, it isnt lets assume nc was dead right now, you dont think sc would control all the north? or lets say the drones conquer you guys what then?this isnt about nc sadly you guys just are easier to single out because you guys abuse this the most and have done for the longest time (which is stated even on the wiki pages), as i said in my first post it was a three way thing it was only during this time where i was corrected on sc no longer existing (assuming it isnt a false / fake reset) if they did exist both sc & ncs extreme abuse of naping would have continued to have been mentionedin all honesty i think riverini or w/e (aka derek chu) emo raging saying nc are the best, indestructible and theres not a single thing i can ever do about it kindda made me mention your coalition a little more than i had anticipated, saying that it isnt anything personal since its about diplomacy which affects even empire it just isnt abused as it is in 0.0"
6/27/2010,"although sni ui really needs help i dont like the idea of a library system, i think really the ability to add colortags to blueprints so that they are easily recognizable for whatever reason you choose is a better option"
6/27/2010,a ui that helps organize bpos & bpcs in to their categories. vary nice. think we need this level of organization.
6/27/2010,bump~
6/27/2010,1
6/27/2010,"because people docked up in stations must leave through the undock point, making them easy to detect and intercept when they become active. compare with cloakers, who can be anywhere in a system and become active without warning.no, it's not. as cloakers have a massive advantage when it comes to knowing what the opponent has. cloakers can be active or afk without anyone knowing the difference. cloakers can also use covert-cynos, instantly injecting an unknown quantity of reinforcements.utterly ridiculous, as cloakers are the ones who dictate engagements. get a force that can kill them, and they won't engage. that's a problem, as it puts an undue burden on defenders, who must be organized and alert 23/7 to counter them, while cloakers can be in system and asleep with no penalty.who sends a fleet of cloakers through a gate anymore? how does training cloaking counter cloaking? seriously, do you even play the game?"
6/27/2010,cloaks needing fuel is a better idea
6/27/2010,"cloaks are fine the way they are.as has previously been said, make them probeable (is that even a word?!?) or nerf them in any other way and all you have is another class of ship that's worthless and won't be used."
6/27/2010,"omg, no! it's the invasion of the invisible paper ships. let me get my thinking cap to match wits with the pilot that lets himself be outnumbered by paper ships while ignoring the wealth of intel on the local communication line.since you already ignore local, move to wspace where watching local is useless and ignoring your sensor data gets you killed anyway. on second thought, you could fit a cloak and beat them at their own game by cloaking every time someone pops up on local. you won already!"
6/27/2010,covert ops cloaks shouldnt be probable. i do think ships fitting non cov ops cloaks should be probable through some sort of sov upgrade though. but that isn't what you proposed here.
6/27/2010,why a sov upgrade?
6/27/2010,because you shouldn't be able to just go into any system and probe out that cloaking vagabond that keeps outrunning your gangs. if he can make it out of your sov with this upgrade he should be ok. if you put a mechanic usable in any system to detect improved and proto cloaks the items would become worthless. a sov upgrade puts a monetary cost on it and makes the feature stationary. you have to decide if it's really worth the cost to find cloakers.
6/27/2010,"many proposals over the year, ccp laughing at the headache caused by cloak-&-go-to-werk/bed/screw...such as"
6/27/2010,"so sov holders should be able to gank every cloaky vaga in their systems, but roaming gangs should not? sounds pretty unbalanced to me."
6/27/2010,"for an afk cloaker there is an extremely elegant and non invasive nerf called ""afk-timer"" that kicks you out from the game. usually it's 15mins but, since eve is based on being afk while logged on, we could have it longer like an hour or so.ofc. there would be no end to whining from afk-bombers once ccp implements such a timer."
6/27/2010,"nah you could make it something like a grid based weapon you remotely fired through a cyno like the old remote dd. by remote i simply mean offgrid from the pos or sov structure allowing you to do it. you would *have* to know the grid the vaga is on. if he is smart and safe spotting he will still be largely untouchable. but the days of sitting 200km of a gate for days would be gone. as for a roaming gang, why give the players a module to completely nullify an entire series of items? such a module would become mandatory for pretty much every op ever making improved, proto, faction, and officer cloaks worthless. those cloaks already have a downside during most other time's, it's the scan res decrease,speed reduction, and lock time delay."
6/27/2010,"just as the title says. currently there is only a short cut for drones to:return and orbitreturn to drone bayengage targeti propose there be one for ""launch drones"". even break it down where you can pick which folder to launch."
6/27/2010,drone lover for 5 years now.
6/27/2010,"i expect the biggest reason this hasn't happened is the ui difficulties - specifically, picking the drone group to launch. if they can get that sorted out(probably by picking a default or something), i'm all for this."
6/27/2010,this would be nice to have
6/27/2010,yeah!!!1

6/27/2010,"current situation: when you have a character on your watch list, and they log in or out, you get a little green/red notification in the bottom right of your eve window, with their name written on top of their portrait. this is non-interactable, and other than name and portrait, you have no information about who the person is. proposed changes: 1) move the portrait above the name. on top of the portrait, add the icon indicating your relative standings towards that player, the same as you get on their portrait in show info. 2) make the notification interactable - right-clicking the notification should bring up the same menu you'd get right-clicking on that player's name anywhere else in game. 3) when you finally(not soon enough!) give us back our ability to sort contacts, presumably with a tag system, make hovering over the notification pop up a tooltip showing the contact's tags. benefits: 1) and 3) give you more information about the character at a glance, which is useful to people who have, say, both friendly business contacts and war targets on their watch list. 2) makes it much easier to make use of the information that the notification is giving you. drawbacks: 1) would take up slightly more screen space, though obviously this isn't going to last very long. 2) and 3) have no drawbacks."

6/27/2010,"there are a host of issues like this. i think you should expand this topic as many very opposite options are next to eachother. for titans the jump and bridge to commands, for jump bridges unanchor and jump, and many more. there's really no reason for these beyond bad ui design."
6/27/2010,thumbs up
6/27/2010,i'm strongly against any new capitals until ccp sits down and balances the existing capitals to be honest.capitals online is boring as hell.
6/27/2010,"just give them something fun. like strip off all special abilities other then say titan dd and supercarriers 3 drones per level, then give them something like ""can not be interdicted"""
6/27/2010,"i think making them untacklable would actually be incredibly overpowered. giving them something like a longer jump range, less fuel use, less triage/siege fuel use, or a tracking bonus. these things would make them uniquely useful but not make them overpowered."
6/27/2010,"i duno if you actually read my responses before billowing out faecal matter.this whole proposal will make 'ganking' and people dying more prominent. so would you please stop with the 'adapt or gtfo you stupid nub' comment, because your talking to the wrong guy.i want more ganking in the 0.5 zones, more pirates, more 'entry class' pvp for newbies to join in on."
6/27/2010,"it's a bad idea. miners wont go into 0.5 systems then because of no concord on belts, and ratters wont bother because it's still hi-sec quality rats. any missioning systems would dry up too. there are a lot of 0.5 systems too, so you are just packing the remaining people into 0.6 and up.you'd also make certain systems in the middle of hi-sec pirate bait. niarja for one would turn into ""industrial ganking central"" and a lot of other systems that don't even border low-sec would suddenly become pvp zones. anjedin is one. so would a lot of dead-end systems small corps use as home."
6/27/2010,"1. i already read your sorry excuse of a proposal and i already addressed it a while ago, in case u were too stupid to remember.2. lemme refresh your memory, seeing as how u can't even remember your own proposal--all u want is to turn high sec into low sec and even more ez ganks, as if the gank targets will still stay like mindless rats. and your excuse is giving newbies something that already exists.3. so once again, u want more ganks, adapt to work for them instead of getting ccp to spoonfeed them to u or gtfo."
6/27/2010,maybe it's to think about it.i have great idea.did you see sphere which probe makes while scanning?i propose to make same.your ship is this center and in this sphere your sensors automatically track targets.or maybe not a sphere but just sircle.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.p.s. took img from google.
6/27/2010,i think that would be a good idea if combined with removal of local =d
6/27/2010,"they already are, i thought. but if they aren't, then yeah, drones too. hell, if they have a cargo list on the fittings screen(for ammo/cap boosters/etc), i'd be happy with that too. all the incidental stuff that gets forgotten is what i want."
6/27/2010,"oh my... seriously?! seriously?! laughingi have run hundreds over hundreds of missions and i never had problems with agents sending me into lowsec, except in the few cases where i was using an agent in a border system. when i did that, it did not escape my attention. i knew what i was doing and simply rejected the missions that went into lowsec. when i did not like the frequency of that happening, i just moved elsewhere, further away from lowsec. it worked when i was tired, when i was sick, when i was drunk and hell it worked when nothing of that applied. i'd have to literally take a shotgun and forcibly remove most of my brains to fail reducing the issue with lowsec missions to absolutely zero.this whine is as if you crap your pants and then flame the pants company with ""you suck! why is it possible to crap in the pants you sold me? can't you include a plug that seals off my colon? you can't expect me to have any control over my own bowels, can you? this is all your fault. and it really stinks, guys!"""
6/27/2010,"what's the problem? people elected him, if he's too blunt for you htfu."
6/27/2010,"currently jumping through a gate lands you a short, fixed distance from the destination gate. i propose adding an option to jump to a different distance by choosing the distance from a menu similar to the warp to menu.this should cause several effects:gate camps are more vulnerable to counter attack if the camp does not control both sides of the gate.travel feels safer because you have more control. scouts are less necessary to avoid dying in a fire.lag is reduced in 0.0 because defending a system requires camps in all adjacent systems, not just packing 100s of defenders in the same system.this proposal stands by itself, but it would work well with changes to bubbles and gate guns in low-sec."
6/27/2010,"this sounds suspiciously like an ""end lowsec gate camps"" thread."
6/27/2010,"oh, please. it'd end nullsec gate camps too."
6/27/2010,"i agree low-sec camps have serious disadvantages with wtz and without bubbles. gate guns should be removed from deep low-sec and have real tracking and resolution in other low-sec. ship generated bubbles should be allowed in low-sec.camps will be effective at stopping travel and will catch people who can't use the scanner or auto-pilot. you won't get easy kills on unscouted jumps.current jump mechanics encourage blobbing on a single gate. it would be better to spread out camps, trap people in system and probe them down. small roaming gangs would have more ship options. it's a shame that jump bridges and cynos have removed the strategic value of gates."

6/27/2010,"this is a new tactic for ank-partisans, truly interesting. everybody agreed that ank was mass spamming all over the place during the campaign. copies of the spam were posted in various threads, and not even her most rabid troll partisans disputed them. and now that a bit of distance has gotten between the campaign and the present, all of a sudden some folks are trying to question whether or not they really happened at all. i should have seen it coming, but i guess i still have some faith in humanity."

6/27/2010,"finn: you're being a bit too optimistic, i'd say. sure, you distinguish between ankh and the others, but do you really think the average eve player who doesn't pay close attention to the csm will remember the difference? the story they'll remember is the csm throwing spoons, and they'll completely forget about the effectiveness of the meetings, the actual issues they brought forward, and all the other good stuff. that's not to say that we should keep everything under wraps - or that it'd be possible even if you wanted to - but you have to remember how other people will see this stuff, and not just how you see it. also, i think you'd get a lot more people to take you opinions seriously if you stopped acting like a gargantuan prick towards everyone who disagrees with you. mynx: conversely, i think you're going too far the other way. yeah, it'll play badly. yeah, people will get bad impressions of the csm. but seriously, why are you blaming meissa for this? it was reported to the world by an anonymous alt - perhaps you know who the main is, but i sure don't - and from there, we could hardly fail to get further information trickling out as people did their assorted wtfing. so unless you track down their main, responsibility for this rests solely on the shoulders of the person who actually did the action in question. i get that you're ****ed, but communications discipline is near-impossible in real governments, never mind ones composed of nine nerds volunteering to debate internet spaceships. you're trying to close the barn door after the horse(mule?) has escaped. besides, while what the players think about the csm matters, what ccp thinks matters more. i don't think ccp needs to be told what happened on the forums. ultimately, this whole situation is total horse****. yes, when you put three people in a room, you get politics. that's human nature. but it doesn't have to be the politics of a second-grade schoolyard. i wasn't in iceland, i don't know who acted professionally and who made an ass of themselves. i'd really like to think the count is 9 and 0, but we all know that wasn't the case the whole time. the best way to prevent stuff like this from damaging the csm's reputation is to make sure it doesn't happen in the first place. those of you who acted in a sub-par fashion - and i'm sure you know who you are - knock it the hell off."
6/27/2010,"just to clarify, the meeting minutes should be out in the next week at which time we can talk in more detail about what was discussed. this is because when ccp staff are involved in a csm meeting the minutes have to be agreed by both csm and ccp. some stuff will be under nda (don tinfoil hats).spoongate was a few minutes during the second to last session out of around 26 hours of meetings. people were tired and the issue under discussion was emotive. i only confirmed the incident happened because delilah wild has some kind of anti-sok sentiment and called him a liar i can honestly say the majority of the meetings ended with constructive action points. a couple of meetings did not, but in those cases it was not due to csm members. we hope some of these action points will lead to player requested changes in eve, but that remains to be seen.an example of the csm working together (that i can talk about before the minutes are published). dv and i were in iceland early and felt that the factional warfare presentation that ank had drafted needed some tweaking. it did have all the relevant issues listed but by her admission hadn't yet been polished. we spent about 4 hours on layout changes, drawing diagrams and rewording to ensure it best supported the proposal. when ank arrived in iceland, dv and her spent another 3 hours on it which resulted in a high quality presentation which all three of us were happy with. the csm are probably more united on most topics than ccp would like i spoke to ank earlier today and confirmed that if i disagree with a proposal of hers that it isn't a personal attack. going forward i am hopeful that things will settle down on all sides - much to the dismay of the trolls wishing to see dramaz."
6/27/2010,"indeed, the very model of decorum. ahhh, the standard song and dance. if someone honestly and logically doesn't agree with you, they must be trolling! of course, you and i both know that giving a body ""room to do its job"" has nothing, at all, to do with pointing out when members of that body aren't doing their jobs properly. in fact, the ability to point out when folks aren't working properly within the group is essential to maintaining transparency and accountability."
6/27/2010,"i find it hilarious that it is impossible to report negative facts about ankh in an objective manner (without expressing an opinion) without being labeled as an anti-ankh crusader.we, players, need to know about it and sokratesz just said that it happened, which is fine, no need to go all emo about it."
6/27/2010,"my dear finn, if i didn't know better i would say it sounded like someone had just accused you of committing journalism. i hear that's a capital offense in some parts."
6/27/2010,drama in the csm? well i never...
6/27/2010,"yes, this has never happened before."
6/27/2010,"well, you know what they say... if people would just stop talking about what elected officials do when they're not making public statements, they'd have a much easier time crafting a public image."
6/27/2010,"i dont think this does anything to detract from my opinion of the csm as a functional and useful entity as a whole.it does cement my opinion that ankh is mentally unstable.i do not feel melting down on the other csm members by mynxee is warranted, even if she feels this makes -her- job harder (and it does).mynxee: you are not responsible for how others in the csm behave, you are not responsible for threads about ankhs behaviour either. do not draw these things -to- yourself, there is no need.i firmly believe that csm is a useful project, and with people like mynxee on board even the completely flaked out behaviour of one delegate will not detract from it's utility.just use ankh's latent psychosis and drama as free publicity for a great initiative instead and call it a day :)"
6/27/2010,"that thread serves a useful purpose in reminding us that although ankh has her flaws, at least she's not jade."
6/27/2010,"i posted a wall of text report, one phrase gets highlighted and everybody denounces the entirety of the csm for it. (and they accuse me of being obsessed with her?) the summit was, in my book, very productive and i enjoyed it greatly. there were many fruitful discussions and brainstorms, the only reason i didn't mention the content of that is the nda, and as promised you will receive a lot more info and clarification after the minutes have beep published.this incident says nothing about our 'professional attitudes' or 'the success/failure of the csm'. it was just an incident, get over it, and wait until the content of what was discussed is released."
6/27/2010,"much ado about nothing tbh, that ank is somewhat bonkers is hardly news. so move a long, nothing here to see. for a capable csm this shouldn't be more than a bump in the road.oh and btw: in rl, when somebody throws something at someone else, they get fired."
6/27/2010,quoting this because it neatly summarizes my thoughts on the matter.
6/27/2010,"and it hasn't been anything else, but it is being greatly exaggerated. see above, also."
6/27/2010,"tbh i blame sok for posting this **** on shc and german forums in pursuit of attracting more voters. personally i think i am the one of the rare csm 2,3,5 delegates who dont particularly dislike eva, but i am amazed with the need of certain people (even delegates), now and before elections, to troll and smack her and giving her even more attentions ""slash"" voters.just for the record, every csm lineup where she was on, had at least one worse delegate then she is.vuk laup.s. free vuk lau"

6/27/2010,"it appears that ankh is completely unable to act in a dignified, professional and sane manner. she is clearly a disruptive influence on the group dynamic and appears to be fixated on her own narrow agenda. having read the minutes from previous meetings and with this new revelation i wonder how long it will be before she has a complete hormone induced meltdown.in the interests of the player base, the csm as a whole and most importantly herself i think ankh has no option but to resign."
6/27/2010,"ankh could figure that given the composition of the csm it does give an idea of the way the players that can be bothered to get involved in the management of the game feel.she could try to work as a member of the team to try to make the best of the situation, or she can demonstrate why she is completely unfit to handle the responsibilities that have been placed on her.the interesting thing is that while claiming that others are sociopaths for fighting in a video game that focuses on conflict, if you consider her inability to respect other human beings out of game if they fail to share her exact view points then one starts to have serious concerns about her.mynxee, i'd just say you have a hideous job, but bear in mind that if all of the people in the csm are doing their best to work together yet one is incapable of behaving within civilised norms it isn't something should be swept under the carpet. otherwise it just ends up continuing the cloak of secrecy that ccp enforces through ndas and means we can't actually judge whether the csm is worth anyone's time and attention. we already have to 'trust' the csm on enough things so when you start choosing what we 'deserve' to know on the basis protecting the self importance of the csm that trust will be rapidly pushed to breaking point."

6/27/2010,"hell, we've seen people demand the resignation of folks who simply reported on the fact that ank is a silverware flinger. i'm not sure that many folks are fooled that those same folks would be just fine if it was a question of people chucking things at ank, instead."

6/27/2010,this video is definitely related to this thread.
6/27/2010,"i think the question is more what are you trying to do? if i understand you correctly you are upset because sok has got in the road of your ability to ""demonstrate that we can conduct ourselves even a little pro on the csm."" he told the truth right - but you don't think we can handle the truth . . .i think we all know that elected bodies like their constituancy to have the wool pulled over the head - i'm suprised you are so blatent about it.i dunno mynxee but it is kinda hard to take you seriously now. way to emo.i have been through many long, heated, meetings in my life but i am yet to see the spoon thrown. ankh is truly special."
6/27/2010,"while we are waiting for the minutes, feel free to read my report on the csm's accomplishments in iceland."
6/27/2010,"following this logic sovereignty, system upgrades and moon goo should all be removed as they are simply incentives for people to fight in 0.0 an there is not need for them, right, everyone will do pvp the same?to make it simple: your logic if flawed."
6/27/2010,"no. this is the same basic problem; obviously people in 0.0 pvp all the time even when high-end moons or turf isn't at stake, and anybody who knows about combat in 0.0 knows this. people don't go on roams in order to find some deathstars to reinforce. more to the point, moons are rewards and points of contention in the player-created nullsec landscape that help differentiate one zone of control from another, and moons happen to be present in lowsec, too. that there are more things that people can fight over in 0.0 does not mean that the pvpers in 0.0 require those things in order to fight. nobody, ever, has declared ""let's go on a hac roam... we might find a conquerable station!"" or ""let's go bust up their gatecamp, maybe the last ship that dies will drop a moon."""
6/27/2010,"this sounds like the kind of discussion that would be better continued in tha.as for the spoon thing, jesus it was just a spoon, get over it."
6/27/2010,that is right - kids at pre-school centers around the land are known to throw the spoon at lunchtime when they lose their temper. sure they get in trouble but it is just childish exuberance.fear the spoon!
6/27/2010,"why are you guys still on about this? you are all giving fuel to candidates to deliver a fire for the players. to everybody who is taking part in this, i would say let it go. just let it go. let the csm do their csm thing then let's discuss the things related to eve the csm is trying to accomplish for us."
6/27/2010,indeed. ccp should get on with the business of introducing t2 spoon launchers.

6/28/2010,"i disagree. the learning skills add a learning curve to the game which is direclty representative of eve itself. you dont just jump into a hulk, go to 0.0 and profit like in other mmo's where if you learn where the good ****e is you can just go there and take it. no. this is eve, first you must learn how to get that ore, get the cruiser, then level up to get the mining barge, finally the hulk after about a month of hard work. boy does it feel good now that you have it!?same goes with pvp. those t2 guns are a pain-in-the-royal-arse to get, but they are worth it! especially in those ships that require them to be really effective. i have nothing to lose from this and i still do not support it because it made me think about what i wanted to do and train those skills in the order in which best made my char. i absolutely do not want an eve universe where character planning is any less valuable than planning for mass market takeovers or pos assaults.to all posters that think that this is ""pointless time sinking"" then you are wrong. why not just remove the skill system all together then? after all, its just time sinking! why not just buy skills? after all, why would you want to wait to get something important in the game? to all of you, i say join wow where you can go on end-game raids at the end of a week of game play. tl:dl?long story short, this is eve. thought = proficiency. planning = profit. work = reward. risk = reward."
6/28/2010,supported.stripping learning skills does not strip the ability to make your character unique. 5-year vets have had significant benefits from learning skills; newer players will fail to see the math pay out for them over the next couple years as they get omgwtfpwnsauced by said vets.

6/28/2010,imo there should definitely be a bpo/bpc available for the ship. any dev that is short sighted enough to fight such a thing should be gone.
6/28/2010,"i would have to agree. it seems a shame that such a useful and good looking ship will rarely see the cold light of space due to it being irreplaceable.ore lp store for a bcp! make it slightly different colour or model. this preservers the uniqueness of the gift, but makes it a very good addition to the eve universe!"
6/28/2010,"i'd like to see this ship's model reused for something, just so the art doesn't go to waste.without knowing more about exactly what the primae itself will do, and how well it will do it, i can't say that putting out a bpo or bpc for it would be my preferred method of utilizing the art.given that the primae is planned to essentially be a limited edition ship that won't have a lasting impact on the landscape of the game (which, of course, is the very reason why a lot of players are greeting it as a wasted effort), maybe not a lot of thought was put into gameplay/balance aspects of the ship's design (i kind of hope that this is the case, or else it makes the ship's non-reproducible nature and even bigger waste). if that's the case, then some tweaking would have to be done before the primae were to be released as a reproducible ship.even if that is the case, i would hope that ccp would consider the idea of putting in a little more work so that a reproducible primae mk ii (that doesn't have to be its name) is available at some later date. that way players could still have novelty of a free ""prototype""/limited edition primae (the ""gift"" ccp wanted to give us), as well as a more common version of the vessel that's more likely to be used for actual industry to add a little bit of actual depth of to the game.the art and background for this ship, of course, is also very well-suited to the oft-suggested notion of a ship class devoted to salvaging wrecks. ccp may have its reasons for not wanting a ship dedicated to that role (perhaps to preserve some of the advantage of flying a marauder) but if it does simply come down to a matter of dev resources, it seems to me that a lot of the work has already been done.anyway, i hope ccp considers the suggestions that have been made here, and take the sentiment behind them to heart. while having these ships as one-off ""free"" giveaways may be a well-intentioned, i'd like to see more thought devoted to the question of how dev resources should be allocated to improve the game most substantially in the mid- to long-term. this ""gift"" unfortunately serves as a reminder of ccp's sometimes faulty sense of priority."

6/28/2010,you are a short sighted moron.if you look at the history and research dealing with gaming mmo/muds you will find that mostly/pure pvp games die a painful death. it may be slow but they will die out. games that focus on achievement/social interaction/exploration usually just continue to grow until the next better iteration of it comes along.so for a game to grow it needs more than just ha ha i am better than you to keep it going. oh and eve is not even a pvp game. it is now a very complex market simulator.

6/28/2010,"[proposal] inclusion of im to eve gate platformsynopsis: while evegate is now a productional social networking platform, there are opportunities existing to leverage more from eve experience. to facilitate continuity and strengthen social relationships in game, the proposal to include an im feature would be a definite added value improvement to the existing platform. im allows two-way real-time interaction that is currently missing from the social platform at present.as an it professional responsible for collaboration solutions daily in my work, i personally see a real opportunity here to grasp the power of social networking to exploit the gains that can be achieved through faster, real-time communication..... and here's how:1. out of game situations (ie. at work) allows corp/alliance mates to continue interacting2. on-the-fly planning can be achieved easily3. faster reactions to in game situations (ie. decisions needed from ceo, finance director, etc etc)4. makes ""global"" more local. effects of timezones are reduced through more availability.5. building friendships6. keeps the user in game...even if only via chat or voice potentially.technically this can't be too hard to do since integration is already done at a character level and also there are plenty to solid open source im solutions (apis) to work with to make this a reality. perhaps even the existing im used in game could work?? what about the idea of voice enabled?why do this?the sense of community would be boosted. ccp's goal to grow the game would be supported through such an addition and would certainly keep players' minds 'in the game' which essentially is good for the community and corp/alliance commitment. there are more benefits than drawbacks in my opinion as it gives the players more choice with the platform to communicate and interact with their fellow players and friends regardless of their rl responsibilities outside the game. this feature will facilitate improved communication and provide a tighter sense of community for those that can't (for whatever reason) make it to the game but still take part in some of the experiences from where they are.____________________________crale damarwww.lostineve.net"
6/28/2010,"what if it can be taken one step further?star trek online, despite people's opinions of the game itself, added a very cool feature to their in game chat system. they made a xmpp server (the protocol behind jabber, google talk, and facebook chat) which interfaces directly with the game's chat system. not only can a web interface be used to chat with people in game but people can be able to use 3rd party chat programs like pidgin or trillian to talk to people in game. it could even be possible to chat in corp and alliance chat as well."

6/28/2010,"keep the different command center levels on planet. but have the thing you need to drop to be only ""command center building equipment"" or another suitably-named item. once the command center is there, you can expand it by having building materials in your cargo hold and paying isk.example: i have dropped a standard command center and want an elite one, instead.current situation: rip everything down, drop new command center.suggested fix: bring building materials in the system, click command center, expand command center, pay isk & spend materials to make it an elite one.so, keep the skills and the related command centers as is, but make it possible to upgrade a deployed one. (not having the option to downgrade is not needed, as there's nothing to gain by downgrading.)"
6/28/2010,"i find it weird we have so many different cc:s when they all do the same.we could do fine with maybe 3 that could be dropped into any planet type.... elite, advanced and ofc the 'nub wtf ur doing get the advanced one'.also whats so different about barren and terran?shouldn't terran cc be cheaper than lava where you need extra protection?why someone designed so many cc:s that all do the same and have same ratio of cost/cpu/grid.... i mean there could be the caterpilar cc and the ferrari cc instead???"
6/28/2010,"you'll notice that skills only affect either the ship you're currently flying, or an instantaneous action(like setting up a market order) where it can check skills on the fly. nowhere else in the game do skills have an effect. places where you might think they do - like ceo skills - instead work around it, like by having a button to set the ceo skills that apply to the corp, and not updating them in real time. so if we infer from that, i think it's actually a reasonable bet that what you ask for simply wouldn't work in the game code. skills don't do what you want them to do. reason #8472 why ccp needs to re-code the game, but we all know how likely that is. so, because they can't do it that way, they use this terrible kludge instead."
6/28/2010,"the proposal was just generic really, ill change the title to get ppl to understandits really about doing something about cloaking gangs that can just cloak up in a system for weeks, popping off ppl whenever they choise and be totally invunerable, and again these ships arent just crappy ones, rapiers, arazu, sbs, pilgrims in the rigth setup are in a totally win win situation, and they are fast so even with out a cloak they are crazy but with well...invulnerable.!!"
6/28/2010,"honestly you won't get any support. these are supposed hardcore pvpers that believe risk should only apply to their targets, not themselves. they'll spew crap like ""eve's supposed to be harsh and with risk"", but leave out the ""risk"" they face when they cloak-camp a system 24/7, choosing and picking out their targets at will.the only way to pop them is to hope they're stupid enough to fall for a trap."
6/28/2010,"it's been stated time and again that ccp wants to replace local, etc, with a better scanning system. so why are we even discussing cloaking if we don't have any immediate balanced solutions on the table?"
6/28/2010,no. cloaked ships should not and will never become able to be probed.
6/28/2010,wow you sound really bitter.
6/28/2010,actually ccp have stated at the last two fan fests that they do in fact want non cov ops cloaks to be probable.
6/28/2010,and you sound like someone trying to divert from the issue .
6/28/2010,ccp said this about the current implementation of d-scanner. the point here is to ask ccp to look into doing something about this neglected game feature. ccp will then decide how to go about automating it and what changes need to be made.
6/28/2010,there is no need to automate it. at all. you have no chance if you're making an argument derived from a false premise.

6/28/2010,"(originally posted in features and ideas discussion: camera mode: follow ship)new camera mode: follow shipother than the ""normal"" camera style where you can look at everything from every angle from any distance, how about creating an extra camera setting (can be done via a right click menu on the ""reset camera"" button) that makes the camera ""follow"" the ship, or to have a ""relative"" position rather than an absolute one (so when the ship turns, you see the ship stay still but the background moves; when the ship goes ""up"" your camera will tilt as well).the reason for this is1. fun, and creating a sense of ""becoming the ship"" rather than looking at the universe through a 3rd persons view all the time.(lore-wise your pod is supposed to put you into a perspective where you become the ship effectively, and the current 3rd persons camera doesn't feel like it. also, it represents the camera drone being ""idle"" and stays in the same location near (and relative to) the ship, because there just shouldn't be a universal ""up"" or ""down"" in space.)2. tactical usages. the camera can be set to follow an enemy ship for example, just like the old camera.notes1. the universe will be ""unflattened"" and might be harder to understand for new pilots. in fact the game will look so much different when you perceive it like an air-combat game, instead of the current submarine-like sensations. (also it will look like the upcoming spaceship game black prophecy.)2. you can keep turning your ship by just spamming clicks at one point on the screen. (but not really unrealistic for a pod pilot; he is supposed to have a very high degree of control of the ship) effectively a first person shooter without wasd, while is not intuative but it is already an ""improvement"" over the current click click control.alternative solutionright clicking the reset camera button will bring up a message box with a tick box, if you untick ""axis lock"" it becomes the new camera mode. (default is on, so new players can still view the game in easy-mode.)(""axis lock"" because of how the current camera is locked to a fixed z-axis.)tl;drcamera follows your ship like a first person shooter, no more ""your submarine is going upwards"" feeling.please tell me what you think of the idea. please excuse my poor english if there's any mistake. and thanks for reading."

6/28/2010,disclaimer: ideas presented in here are not my original ideas. in-depth coverage of the idea can be found here
6/28/2010,forgot to support. lol.
6/28/2010,"not supported, there are more professions in eve than just pvpers.for traders and industrials this would just cause too much trouble."
6/28/2010,"not supported. in my experience, faction warfare is so very far removed from pvp in any other area of the game that it's almost its own unique environment. that's why corporations and alliances that get wrapped up too heavily in it tend to excel at faction warfare, but fail catastrophically at other methods of pvp they used to be good at (star fraction's epic failure in at8 being a prominent example). fw is inherently disorganized, focused on either small numbers of tiny ships or massive gigablobs with very little else in between, and occurs in the most dangerous place in the game, low-sec - not where you want to drop a new player fresh off his trial account.a new player in fw generally learns the following things:1) they are cannon fodder. they don't have the sp to fit anything half as good as someone that's been playing for even a few months. they are a speed bump the enemy runs over to go after more experienced people.2) low-sec is full of people who want to kill you. considering this is where they go to get killed by enemy militias, pirates, and sometimes their own militias, new players in fw tend to develop an even stronger bias against low-sec than players who never go there. there's nothing in low-sec that you can't get in high-sec without having to worry about everyone in local killing you.3) fleets are just a bunch of people flying in a blob. this is because, let's be honest, most fw fleet commanders are terrible. even if they were good, they have no control over what ships they get in their fleet and they can't coordinate anything beyond the most simple tactics because their pilots won't listen to them. fw fleets tend to be like a hammer - they have no finesse, they simply rely on hitting the other guy as hard as possible.4) eve is too hard. like it or not, that time most new players spend in high-sec without any pvp has a purpose - it helps them get the finances they need to afford things. chucking them right into the giant isk hole that is faction warfare and saying 'good luck!' when they can only afford a handful of rifters will give them a false impression of how difficult eve is. given how difficult it actually is, this is quite a feat, and will likely result in new players getting fed up and leaving moreso than they already do.edit: i've heard rumors that one of the advanced tutorial agents already nudges new players towards faction warfare, and most people that i've mentioned this to (almost all of them current or former fw participants) think it's a bad idea. not even giving the player the choice, as you suggest, would be even worse."
6/28/2010,"i only read what was here on this thread. i didn't went in the link you provided and read that so heres my thoughts on your idea.current fw system and newbie system tutorial from which i know: are you out of your ffff mind ??? (sorry for outburst)from the start the player is guided and ccp his holding is hands very thight. from my knowledge we do get new people in faction warfare and this is what i see in chat ""ok, i'm in fw and i'm new, what do i do ?"" thats it ??? they hit the brick wall and they're stuck there. if you want your idea to be at least good. here are some things needs to be changed or fixed.1. make a complete review, fix current bugs/exploits and make some improvements to fw.2. make another tutorial for faction warfare specifically3. in faction warfare you have corporation under the faction, unfortunately you can't. don't know why but it would be nice to see those corps...just like in an alliance. this would be easier for new people to talk to the corps on the list.if ccp can do those 3 things then yes it would be a good idea but current, no. its a very bad idea honestly. think of a person we drop in a lions cage. we give that man a butter knife and we say, ""save your life"" to that man.to saelie: you sir either do not know about fw or are out of date...i choose lack of knowledge.1) they are cannon fodder. they don't have the sp to fit anything half as good as someone that's been playing for even a few months. they are a speed bump the enemy runs over to go after more experienced people.lots of pilots know how to fit their ships. most pilots fly faction ships by the way if case you don't know. others fly tech 2 ship and lots of pilots i know are very very good at it. if you want a good fit, just ask in militia chat...plain and simple2) low-sec is full of people who want to kill you. considering this is where they go to get killed by enemy militias, pirates, and sometimes their own militias, new players in fw tend to develop an even stronger bias against low-sec than players who never go there. there's nothing in low-sec that you can't get in high-sec without having to worry about everyone in local killing you.0.0 also have blobs, rr bs blobs too. people killing their own corp mates all over new eden buddy. imo its better to learn pvp in fw because it happens in low sec and as you've said, we have pirates, the neut dumb ass in a bs that wants to kill you on a gate and loads of enemies at your disposal...no need to wait 3 hours to kill something3) fleets are just a bunch of people flying in a blob. this is because, let's be honest, most fw fleet commanders are terrible. even if they were good, they have no control over what ships they get in their fleet and they can't coordinate anything beyond the most simple tactics because their pilots won't listen to them. fw fleets tend to be like a hammer - they have no finesse, they simply rely on hitting the other guy as hard as possible.again lack of knowledge on your part. i know some fc's that are good, other terrible. but thats the same all over the eve unisverse. its not always blob meister in fw, you got some pilots that hangs out in solo sometimes and other who wants small fleet, nothing big, we got everything here. just as in any fleet, you need ewar, support, logi and all of that and we have it...not just full alpha dps lol4) eve is too hard. like it or not, that time most new players spend in high-sec without any pvp has a purpose - it helps them get the finances they need to afford things. chucking them right into the giant isk hole that is faction warfare and saying 'good luck!' when they can only afford a handful of rifters will give them a false impression of how difficult eve is. given how difficult it actually is, this is quite a feat, and will likely result in new players getting fed up and leaving moreso than they already do.with a full set of tech 1 ship (frigates for example), you can wreck havok while doing a low sec roaming event. its been done before and its really fun. nothing is more fun than hearing a bs pilot yell in local help or stop while you pound him with frigate dps . mwhaa. just like everywhere else in eve, you bring what you can afford to lose man. honesly i find high sec more dificult only because of the high sec wardec griefers that exist there. once they got you in their lock, your dead for a long time buddy."
6/28/2010,"i believe you missed the part where i said i was looking at it from a new player's perspective. your comments verify most of what i said, in that light.1) you claim most people fly faction or at least can fit t2. this i know. however, the new player shuttled into fw right off his free trial cannot, and thus, he becomes everyone's victim. thus his perception that he is cannon fodder, because he is.2) those things do happen all over eve but they happen a lot more in low-sec, something you seem to agree with. this runs counter to the op's idea that putting newbies into the militia will help them 'overcome' their fear of low-sec - it won't, it'll just make it worse.3) some fw fcs are good, some are terrible, however the good ones are generally less likely to accept a complete newbie into their fleet because that newbie knows nothing about fleet procedure or operations and thus becomes a hindrance. that's part of what makes them a good fc, knowing who *not* to accept. so the new player is far more likely to experience the terrible fcs that don't care who they get.4) yes, you can do this. if you're experienced. a new player is unlikely to have the kind of experience or the connections required to get into one of those small roaming groups (again because he's a newbie and doesn't know what to do, something experienced fcs don't like).again, i think you simply argued my points without reading the note above them that indicated i was looking at it from the perspective of a new player foisted into faction warfare by the op's proposal."
6/28/2010,i find this utterly hilarious and stupid all at once.yes lets force the new players into faction war only to find out that they are completely and utterly alienated from half of the high sec world by ****ing off the opposing factions.the rest has already been covered but i find it rather funny that everyone missed that point.just frakking brilliant.please... go back to school while you still have dignity left.ps: not to mention fw is utterly screwy as it is.
6/28/2010,most people who have a fear of low sec have it because they went in unprepared and got horribly killed by 10 pirates after the first jump. guess what is going to happen when you send a rookie into low sec who barely knows how to warp manually and what that is going to do for his feelings about low sec.
6/28/2010,you can't revitalize a borked game mechanic. doesn't matter how much blood you pump in if the heart stopped beating 2 years ago.newbies do need help to get into pvp but giving experienced fw'ers more easy targets really isn't the way.
6/28/2010,"i knew and i was. you put all newbs in the same basket, you think all newbs are ******s and smacking their heads on their keyboard. don't do that again please.why ? because we got some training pvp roaming fleets from time to time especially for those people. they get some kills too.you know, thinking about that. i personally got more problems dealing with fw veterans on comms, voice and orders because most of the time they don't listen to orders which gets them killed. when you say shut up to a newbie, 99% they listen.which leads me to this old saying which could give the current state of fw from an experience fw pilot ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks"". i could give you horror stories in fw which only involves vets.going back to newbies, not all of them are stupid, believe me.i still hold my ground, if ccp can ""fix"" and tweak fw, then yes this idea would be good...if not, dont send them here please for the love of god."
6/28/2010,"i think it will be very cool to add next features:1) presets for orbit/keep at range buttons in selected item window.every pilot with this feature can set his own orbits/ranges. it will be useful to fast changing of orbit due to combat situation. for exapmle: i've spotted hostile ship (e.g. cruser class) in grid and decided to attack him. i use first preset button ""orbit at 5 km"" to stay near him in optimal range of my turrets, and suddenly he starts to neutralise my capacitor. then i click on button with preset orbit distance of 15 kilometers, activate afterburner (or mwd) and reload my turret with longrang ammo.the idea is to set buttons for fast orbit change2) (optional) add hotkeys (shortcuts/buttons) for express step-like change of current orbit distance:hotkeys to raise and lower orbit distance for 10 km hotkeys to raise and lower orbit distance for 5 km hotkeys to raise and lower orbit distance for 1 km with regardsp.s. sorry of my bad english - its not my native language"
6/28/2010,"no more buttons...replace the orbit and keep at range buttons with range slider instead[--------o----------] [-]12,5km[+]you could drag the o to adjust orbit or click -/+ to decrease/increase orbit by 500m"
6/28/2010,"a proposition about hot-keys is pretty good. imho, change orbit by slider in combat will be slowly, than button clicking.also it would be correct for keeping range, may be..."
6/28/2010,"shamelessly stolen. also, supporting my own topic."
6/28/2010,"absolutely supported. i might also add...lock on / look at <- annoys the hell out of me!view market details / trash it <- really, why are these next to each other? open my cargo / eject <- i've never made this misclick but it bothers me having them next to each other when i am salvaging."
6/28/2010,"goes to show that ccp really don't play eve as much as they say they do, or these things would have been fixed. i noticed these things as a problem as a noob years ago. you mean to tell me if they really play they wouldn't have noticed this?they either don't have the time to be bothered( more time sink useless pi mining schtuff getting in the way), but honestly with skills like omnipotence and flying around jovian ships you think they play the game like we do???. either way i don't see this being fixed soon. ui stuff always takes forever, it seems to be woven into the spacetime of eve or something and can't be disturbed or the whole thing will come crashing down"
6/28/2010,"if there is any thing that is more obnoxious in high-security space fights, it is neutral people intervening with remote repairing of any kind. there is very little someone can do about this, and it almost always ends up with the person who was getting the repairs winning the fight, even if they were the lesser player.the only realy thing a victim of this cheap tactic could do is shoot the person who is neutral repairing. but the problem with this is the repairing can dock at any time they want, so if they get shot they can immediately dock into safety. and by this time the opponent was repaired enough so that they end up winning the fight.i think that if i'm going to get killed by this, then i should at least get a killmail on that enemy ship that is remote repairing. so i propose that if someone repairs someone, then they cannot dock or jump through a stargate for 1 minutes, just like if you were to shoot someone.this would also bring down the amount of people using this tactic because they actually have to take a risk, and it would increase the market for logistic ships, because they will actually be dieing now."
6/28/2010,disregard
6/28/2010,"wtb true sanshas dreadnought kthx.this would actually be a clever thing to do right now, plotwise, with the current live event storyline having the sanshas suddenly flashing caps, supercarriers and even titans. maybe open them up in a pirate faction militia lp store?"
6/28/2010,putting them in a pirate lp store is actually exactly what i suggested.
6/28/2010,"a possible way to manage this through the lp store without requiring 2-3 years of grinding lp might be to break the capitals up into 4-5 items. have the bpc available to buy there, but make the bp require a number of other items only available off the same lp store in order to be built. this would allow players within a corporation to effectively pool their lp in order to accquire one of these toys, as the cost would be split maybe 4-6 ways."
6/28/2010,i really like that idea. working on a revised op atm.
6/28/2010,i really don't like this idea. as if the game isn't enough capitals online already.
6/28/2010,do you really think this would create more capitals and not just a wider variety? capital proliferation will continue even without the option of new faction ships.
6/28/2010,this.not supported.
6/28/2010,"it isn't capitals that are boring, it is having to pound on a structure that no one will defend that is boring. even the reinforcement mechanic doesn't usually lead to fights.edit: support more faction stuff."
6/28/2010,ccp did mention plans for faction capital modules and more capital sized modules at the last fanfest i.e capital sized armour plating though no mention of plans for faction capitals although would be pretty cool so supported
6/28/2010,"first you must realize it takes six months to a year just to change a model (say, to add a turret mount).now i want you to read through that post very carefully. note that faction models can take several more something somethings to do and capital ships have animations as well which requires even more things and stuff which then has to go back and re-do something somethings and... it's all very technical. we only have estimates and guesses as to what it takes to create an entire ship model for a faction capital ship, but experts throughout the field have estimated it can take upwards of a decade (minimum!) to produce a ship model. a faction capital ship would be awesome but it just isn't possible. ccp would likely have to divert the resources of their company entirely to produce it, possibly bankrupting eve and destroying the game.i hope you understand, these are just the facts we have to face. it isn't possible."
6/28/2010,"yet they produce a toy ship every few months for the playerbase. take that team, put them on this. blam, you have a long term project for those people to work on that is more than ""hey a shuttle with a probe launcher"""
6/28/2010,"the real desbalance are in the form which the supercarrier bonus are applied on each race:nyx: damage bonus apply on fightersbombers;aeon: masive tank boost on armor resistances;wyrven: masive tank boost on shield resistanes;hel: bonus of remote reps identical to a carrier.whit fleet combat fit, hel can cap estable operate only two reps remotes.in other words:1 nyx = damage done like 8 thanatos1 aeon/wyrvern = tank like 15 carriers;1 hel = remote rep like 2 nid or 1 siege carrier;hels reps bonus need a rebalance fix acoording her supercarrier status.reps range?amount of hp repaired?caps bonus to operate rep remote modules?tanks habilities arent the real problem if this fail bonuses will be fix."
6/28/2010,"this seems like an accurate assessment. because the bonuses are still based on the module, not the ship (like the other races' s-carriers), the bonuses do not scale up like those of the other races' s-carriers."

6/28/2010,"ahhh... disagreeing with your opinion is trolling. classic. it certainly was a bit odd that mynx's response was to get upset that the 100% accurate and correct facts were related to the playerbase. if one of the csm members responds to frustration by not only constantly complaining about conspiracies against her and refusing to work with people who disagree with her, but by actually throwing things at people she doesn't like... well, the playerbase deserves to know about it. that's what transparency and accountability are all about. and, if nothing else, the voters deserve to know what's going on now rather than waiting till the next election cycle to be bombarded with all this **** at once. mynxee is generally a quality player and seems to be a decent leader, but getting upset (in public) when the truth was reported is always a bad tactic. the best way to stop the playerbase learning of temper tantrums like the one that was reported is to make sure that csm members aren't throwing temper tantrums. and nobody is responsible for anybody else's behavior."

6/28/2010,"that's very disconcerting - but completely in line with a lot of other things we get from ccp: incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent, incomprehensible.more transparency and updates are one of the constant requests you can find and every time the reply is ""that might be good"".it just never happens.kudos for continuing with something that appears to be pointless on so many levels."
6/28/2010,this reminds me on some eastern parliament with small brawl interims :pthe csm is presenting itself pretty bad in the player community. read the entire forum thread with the point of view of a 3rd party and tell me what you think after the reading.to make a conclusion:- 1 person misbehaves- several people plantig the facts in forums knowing it will heat a discussion- showing no unity in forums- lack of communicationyou do not need to like each other but stop drama. drama consists of- support- antisupport- facts- nda- using informations you gained as profit of some kind- diskussions of any kind with 3rd party members- quarrels in public
6/28/2010,"well written, but i require some more details as soon as you have slept and have time :)"
6/28/2010,fun things to read... shiney...ty for the update ^^ will read again when more awake :)edit: do you guys have pictures of any kind? any? please?
6/28/2010,"do you feel that you can demonstrate professionalism and the ability to bring issues to ccp's attention best by throwing things at people who disagree with you overhand, or sidearm? perhaps you could express your professionalism better by kicking? perhaps biting?"

6/28/2010,"so do you think that we can best help ankhes to reach her full potential by giving her darts, or perhaps frisbees? maybe paper airplanes?"
6/28/2010,nice summary. thanks for the info. definitely looking forward to seeing the minutes...
6/28/2010,"a good start to the csm5. kudos to mynxee and the comittee for the hard work on behalf of us lowly immortals, and thanks to ankh for putting up this update.i look forward to more updates and eventual resolution of the issues raised."
6/28/2010,"so basically nothing on eve will be worked on for another year or 2 while they ""finish"" dust and release some more eye-candy in the form of wis?sounds like the sociopaths have taken over."
6/28/2010,"this is friggin unbelievable. 6 months of petitions, forum whines, mass tests, etc. etc. and ccp still didn't manage to actually become aware of all the symptoms players have been screaming about?yep, dynamic handover of players. i called it!also, thanks for confirming my suspicion that nathan is a dork."
6/28/2010,"excellent report.one obversation. ccp always hammered that incarna and dust would be created in atlanta and shanghai respectively, and would not take any resources away from eve.big fat lie?"
6/28/2010,"an interesting read, but a little depressing.looking forward to spooning up the minutes, though."
6/28/2010,"pretty much that, was interesting, but it pretty much says csm is being ignored (non-shocker) and ccp doesnt have any plans to fix stuff. new ui would also be way bigger selling point then stuff like planetary interaction in an expansion."
6/28/2010,"i wonder if this ""non-official"" report violates the nda..."
6/28/2010,"good informative report, despite the circus. however, i just want to add that having fractured reports from different csm members is not what folks are looking for. my impression at this point is that the csm reps are only putting more efforts towards self-interest rather than dealing with the issues put forward. your whole public front is fractured, which no doubt is good drama food for the drama afficianados.let me ask this question. do you have a single website or information source where everything regarding csm can be perused/viewed/referred/archived/discussed? the official eve forum, eve wiki and various csm individual sites don't really fit into this picture. let me give a rhetoric. what would your response be if i'm an eve noob and complaning about pve missions? get the idea now?"
6/28/2010,"i highly doubt that, since when reading the previous meeting minutes ankh exactly knows what falls under the nda, and such details are not published by her requests."

6/28/2010,ccp's reluctance and inability to respond to the csm isn't as bad as i had anticipated. i was actually expecting an eddie murphy beverely hills cop style ::fingersinears:: la la la i can't hear you you think you are talking to me but i cannot hear you you might as well stop talking i cannot hear you.
6/28/2010,"totally confirming ccp are still playing their own game.awesome!*edit*could you explain what kind of stakeholder the csm represents when basically none of the issues get any commitment and how this is a ""major step forward""?"
6/28/2010,"i'm almost angry, and feel like we've become similar to the wow community in that our development team has been pulled away from an existing, fruitful game to work on completely separate games. i wouldn't mind if this game was more or less fixed and the previous expansions more or less completed, but that isn't the case."

6/28/2010,"finnagain,if you are so wise and allknowing, why didn't you try to run for csm?why is it that anyone not agreeing with you get's the name troll? is that the main responce in your vocabulary?and looking how the rest of the csm is more involved in teaming up against one candidate they don't agree with instead of doing what they were elected for i seriously doubt this whole csm delegation is worth the votes they received.as for the remark from malkanis that ankh pulled away votes from other more worthy candidates, please show me which.sok is mainly doing his hatething versus ankh and as such is wasting his seat clearly for personal grudges.finnagain is clearly a loudmouth who has nothing better to do then call other people trolls when they don't agree but when push comes to shove nothing really worthwhile comes from him.i don't give a rats ass that people don't like eachother in the csm, they weren't voted in there to like eachother, but to work as a group to help better the game.now however it seems more and more it's actually 2 camps who are more busy battling eachother than doing what they were elected for.i want to congratulate them to bring real politics into eve and doing actually nothing else then receiving some minor perks without doing anything relevant.so here finny, now go on and call me a troll again.about fw.my personal idea about fw was always more concentrated about actual pvp over territory to increase the influence of your faction, if you want to run missions you don't need fw. make fw actually that what players expect from it. one side battling the other side for dominance and make it worthwhile in some way to actually establish dominance, and not by completing some missions or crap cloaky sitting at some spot.do something about the ui and also about the various docking ranges at stations.make docking timers at stations also longer when initiating agression. this mainly to make the undock and docking game less feasable and make docking a real risk if you want to pew someone.all that kind of crap they should work on, not on stuff like "" whaa, i don't like you so you can't play with me"""
6/28/2010,"because you're lying and that's not true? that was an easy question. i agree, but you need to step up your trolling. p.s. if you don't want to be called out for trolling, maybe stop trolling?"
6/28/2010,a real reply like my 8 year old nephew would do. you sir are certainly a gem in responces for 3rd grade. i salute your extensive ways of looking superior.and just to be sure you understood what i said.i was being utterly and completely sarcastic in my first remark.

6/28/2010,so the usual 0.0 centric csm is upset that someone isn't in favour of bumping all 0.0 issues and suppressing all fw issues?best csm member yet!sick of csm being used as a complaints reduction machine while ccp goes off to develop other products.light a fire under them!if the devs think we're all idiots for wanting over-hyped expansions to be finished within 5 years of release then they can live with us not paying their wages anymore.from the very start it's easier to keep existing customers then to acquire new ones.keep releasing expansions for the sole purpose of hype and promotion to new customers and you lose.ccp survive the gfc only to spend all their dev time on risky tangents......... smart? good for us the existing paying customers of their existing long-standing subscription service?
6/28/2010,"you have a very odd way of confirming that the quote shows that gandry was lying about me in order to troll me (with meta-irony) and that he objected to the fact that his trolling was being pointed out. and of course, now you've insulted me once and made an entire other post to discuss what you see as flaws in my posting style... namely that you are upset that i've insulted people or criticized their posting styles."
6/28/2010,"gandry made one statement about you that was intended to be truth(that most of your recent posts are about ankh), and it's a true statement. so how exactly was he lying about you, or using those lies to troll you?and the difference is that you just accuse people of things randomly, i actually back my statements up. also, i'm willing to acknowledge the possibility of a genuine and reasonable disagreement, whereas you're seemingly not. because seriously, aside from the linguistic errors gandry made in his first post, what he said was pretty reasonable, and your only response was ""you're not even a good troll"". that's not debate, that's flinging poop."
6/28/2010,"please don't derail from my comments because of not using propper english, for a third language i think i do reasonably well in the english department.thing is that finnagain has 2 sorts of responses towards people he doesn't agree with.a: insult them and call them trolls.b: copy and paste one small section and take that as a full quote to hammer along.a real discussion isn't possible with finnagain since he hides behind those 2 mechanics.i will wait a few more years till he's out of the diper phase and try again."
6/28/2010,"no, he made several. the one that was just referenced was his lie that i call everybody who disagrees with me a troll. the fact that it wasn't true, he knew it wasn't true (and you just showed again that it isn't true), therefore he was saying something he knew not to be true in order to throw out flamebait. interesting that you've not only somehow managed to miss context and the situation, you've also ignored half of my post that you're talking about. his ""substantive response"" was in response to a post of mine and rather than responding to a single point that i was making, simply tossed empty insults. what i actually said in addition to the ""only"" thing of ""you're not even a good troll."" was ""brilliant factual response"", because he wasn't actually responding to anything at all i'd said and was merely trolling me. so, ya know, i said he was trolling because he was trolling. and you are somehow imagining a ""reasonable"" anything. he started with [a throwaway insult that i must be bored. then he decided that i must have a personal grudge against ank (totally ignoring the substance of everything i've said). then that her conduct once elected was no concern at all. then that i was quixotic. then another throwaway insult.] and yet while you insult me and talk about the quality of my posting and take me to task for insulting people and commenting about the quality of their posting... now you're supporting a content-free series of personal insults directed at me as very reasonable. curiouser and curiouser. i see you are engaging in some good debate, yes?"
6/28/2010,isn't that exactly what you are doing since the elections began?
6/28/2010,"as noted, you must take into account also other ships with ship maintenance arrays. iteron v rigged and with gscs can take almost 50k. several of those in a carrier would transform the carrier into a cheap jump freighter. (unable to enter hisec, though.)"

6/29/2010,i support this 100%. as and eve player of almost 3 years now. and still playing despite my gripes of actual content that fixes current game mechanics. and pi to be honest was not really necessary. i seemed like a joke feature put out to curb prices. the game needs some work on core things. dominion is a very good example of this. of half hearted features. and not fixing lag and things. if they want the player base to pay for there game fix the ghost jumping lag. ffs 2mins to jump into a system that does not have people in it. work on the game and slow down on features.

6/29/2010,"supported.as a long time player i have to say the mostly lag free months going up to dominion were the most enjoyable months for eve ever. it showed a tantalizing glimpse of what eve could be. sadly, i am rapidly coming to the conclusion that that will have been the only glimpse of what eve could have been in the hands of a professional company. the state of the servers since coming back from a break has shocked me.go back and fix the bugs. leave the shineys in your trousers. i don't care about them and never have compared to a decent, lag free and functional game."
6/29/2010,"there are enough major problems, bugs, and promised yet unimplemented features in the backlog that ccp could spend one or two entire development cycles on them, release them as ""the backlog expansions,"" and they would feel like full expansions.at this point, there's no excuse for ccp not to stop the wouldn't-it-be-cool-if development, and get to work on improving the quality of the existing game."

6/29/2010,"i do not believe that this is a broken mechanic.if you are fighting on a station, a logistics ship takes an entire 60 seconds to come back out of the station at minimum after being forced to dock. when he undocks, you know exactly where he will be, and he has to either wait out his session timer (a further 30 seconds) or brave your damage right on top of him when he becomes lockable right away. if he wants to come out in a fighting ship after gaining your aggro, that's a full 90 seconds.if you are fighting on a gate, you can force a logistics ship through the gate into the arms of anyone waiting on the other side. if they want to come back, they will not only take 60 seconds minimum to do so, but they will be off the gate and thus able to be tackled on their return.i would support the change under one condition: friendly assists must not always give you a 60 second gate/dock timer. there should only be a 60 second gate/dock timer if an assisting action makes you aggressed to someone new (such as a neutral logistics becoming blinky to the assistee's war targets). thus, war target logistics should be able to remote rep corp or alliance mates all they want and jump at any time. and thus, if a neutral logistics began repping someone at war, they would gain a 60 second gate/dock timer at the first rep cycle, but after 60 seconds they would be free to dock or jump at will, even if they were still repping.tl;dr the current mechanic is ok; a change would be ok too as long as repping does not always prevent you from jumping/docking."

6/29/2010,being able to filter the starmap would help hugely: show only selected/current region/constellation/routeview multiple selections (to show home region and connected regions only) or any arbitrary combination up to the full map of everything. expand the star coloration/star icons to be able to overlay colors [like on round aircraft flag insignia] so we can have multiple sets of informaton. like pilots in space last 30mins and kills in the last hour. infact querying specific portions of the starmap instead of the whole thing would probably give performance gains aswell. and +1 support to everying else that has been said so far

6/29/2010,fast forward to the 38 minute mark of this video.personally i would prefer to see +12 in all attribute points and skip the 10% bonus. the end result will be almost the same amount of sp/year but we don't have to mess about with decimal points for the attributes removing even more confusion for new players reading their character sheets.
6/29/2010,"learning skills do nothing for the great game that is eve. i'm sure they were great when they were brought in, giving everyone a chance to train quicker. the only good thing about them is that chance to train quicker. there is no other reason for them. eve wouldnt lose anything from removing learning skills, but it might get more people to play.people say theres not enough people in low or nul sec. removing learning skills might be a way to get more people to play eve. more people playing eve means more people in low and nul sec. more people to shoot at.but the people that do have them trained (especilly 5/5) should be reimbursed those skill points. as op said, we also need the +11 attributes otherwise training will be to slow.+1 nice idea op"

6/29/2010,"for those that learned the learning skills, ccp should allow those players to redistribute the skill points in other fields and get compensated for the skill book cost. also, these pilots should retain a subtle speed bonus based upon how advanced they were with the whole tree. thus those that had it maxed out should have this bonus for about two years, slowly weakening over time.and then it is over.no, there should not be a free-for-all attribute bonus for everyone. people constantly demand the removal of this set of skills. so ccp should remove them and call it a day. let everyone train at the rate of those that never trained the learning skills. people want their cake and eat it too - screw it. let players train with attributes they set-up through the neural remapping and implants they can afford.yep, this will harm me too, but too many whiners demanding the removal and the bonus they entailed all on one silver plate.let's really make this a cold, harsh game again."
6/29/2010,all the counter arguments say the same thing removes depth and planning of the game.removes depth and planning in what way? would it make the game more shallow if we remove them how so? the hundreds of skill even without the learning skills already makes the game so deep that even 4yr vets cant obtain all this skills look at this dude here

6/29/2010,"thought of something reading other peoples posts ( as i am apposed to getting rid of them ). seems like the posts are moreso for newbie players so they play the game rather than 'skill up on learning'.why not do something like this: if you got the skills in cue - thats fine keep em they stay as are.otherwise,they are not available till you have an x amount of skill points.... 3 mill or something.its a bonus for later on to speed up learning.i would be upset if they got rid of them all together as i have skilled up significantly with them for the payoff down the road."
6/29/2010,"as a four year old eve player i fully support the removal of all learning skills, the reimbursement of all sp, to be distributed as you please, and the addition of +10 attributes +10%. however, i'd still like to see remapping unless ccp are going to show, like in the old character creation screens, how attributes are distributed. if ccp don't allow remapping, or the distribution of attributes, as you wish, i will not support this.so, while i'm supporting what op's posted i'd like it to be done right and not the ccp way. after all, who wants to have the bloodlines with totally messed up stats, e.g. 17 perception, 11 willpower and 20 charisma as a pvp bloodline. and before anyone here says ccp won't do that i'd like to point out all the other total ****ups ccp couldn't possibly have got wrong but did regardless."
6/29/2010,"fully support this idea.i hate having to train learning skills again and again. you create an alt, what do you do first? train learning skills. even for a simple alt with a few specific skills on the same account you need for a specific purpose. (hauling, exploration, trading) evemon will suggest you train at least some learning skills.they take time and keep you from training for the fun stuff in eve rather than train for training those things.with the new sp feature it would be even easier to refund those sp people put into learning skills.as for the statement it is a solution looking for a problem: new players get into the game, if they have someone around giving them advice it usually also says: train learning skills early. new players cannot afford the advance learning skills, they don't enjoy playing while they only have learning skill and thus lacking combat/mining/exploration skills in that time. means they might quit sooner.they can off course choose not to do so, but most people will regret it later. because then they no longer have the double training speed which you get below 1.6m sp and those learning skills take even longer to train, thus are even more anoying."
6/29/2010,"i just made an account and learned learning skills are a wise investment early on. also used evemon and made a plan for about 9 months. quite a lot of learning skills were recommended. but i don't feel like investing everything i earn into those expensive (4.5mil each!) skill books. i could buy a nice cruiser for that. for all of them i'd have enough for a battlecruiser almost. at least i got a couple of attribute implants for free which was nice. but i'm not suggesting i need to have that isk refunded for those expensive books if this goes through, i'd be happy enough not having to train them so high and use that time on something else."

6/29/2010,"jesus what are you, some sort of gaming masochist?eve: ""click, slave! *whip whip* click until your fingers bleed!""you: ""yes mistress eve! make me! make me click more!"""
6/29/2010,correction; it encourages macros.requiring several more clicks does not make it harder for macros. i could sit down for half an hour or so and make one to cycle all my extractors if i chose to. it really is just that easy. and it would probably save me from contracting rsi.edit: please visit your user settings to re-enable images.
6/29/2010,"supported.either get rid of multiple deposit choices and let extractors auto-cycle, or allow us to issue mass-orders to all extractors simultaneously."
6/29/2010,i have 5 planets and 10 or so extractors on ea one. its a pain in the ass to do it and i know other people that feel the same way. it would be much easier to multi select them all and set them at the sane time so id definitely support your idea. big thumbs up to it
6/29/2010,please!!!! rsi..its killing to many clicks.
6/29/2010,"ill go one further in terms of csm dsicussion on this matter:pi needs:select allroute alllink allextract allchoose cycle allinstall allplus ctrl click/shift click options to select multiples.i believe the outcome of not addressing these changes will be rampant devaluation of isk, and in terms of keeping players or encouraging new players rampant isk devaluation is not good."
6/29/2010,"mindless repetitive clicking is tedious, boring and ultimately counter productive as the limiting factor. it will just attract macros that squeeze out real players.eve is fundamentally a strategy game, not some mindless twitch fest. therefore the difficulty and challenge in pi should be in devising successful strategies of production and competing with other players and not some torturous ordeal by mouse. i support attention/action on this issue, however i'm not keen on grouping.i think a more dynamic approach that relies and thinking and less on mundane repetitive clicking.i think the best option would be to change the way extractors work and make them much more like processors. they are started and they automatically continue. players attend them, review and tune them on an on going but ad-hoc basis. they start at the best extraction rate, but over time their extraction rate deteriorates. this would be in line with the current extraction cycles rates. so for example: they start at the top rate for 30 mins, drop to the second rate for 5 hours, then the 23 hour rate and finally the 96 hour rate. a player can attend to them and resurvey at the top rate but that is entirely optional.technically this should be quite easy to implement, especially compared to ui changes needed for grouping.at a later stage the ability to vary the production up or down by running missions, a little like with research points and entirely optional, but necessary for the most efficient production.e.g.foreman: ""the machinery is worn out. we need mechanical parts to fix it and get it back to 100% efficiency"" extractor efficiency reduced by 10% until until supplied.foreman: ""the workers are unhappy at being on this forgotten forsake rock and production is suffering (-10% etc). if you supply ""tabacco|spirit|dancing girls"" i'm sure their moral will improve.have some 'missions' that fix reduced efficiency and some that boost efficiency.foreman: ""the machinery is badly designed. we can modify it with x units of robotics and get it upto 110% efficiency""foreman: if you can offer the working an incentive bonus (consumer electronics for the rec room) i sure i can get efficiency up to 110%.etc."
6/29/2010,"to switch on the extractors manually:we have cloak, we have warp drives, we live in space and must switch lots of extractors on manuelly - i think eve will lower the niveau to wow. my opinion is: an option to switch all extractors on per planet..."
6/29/2010,"supported, with a proviso;the original gift versions should retain their skill-less pre-requisites. the manufactured version should have skill requirements to fly.that way the gifted one still retains some unique features over the manufactured version.this should be the case with the zephyr and the upcoming primae."
6/29/2010,yeha the above interests me too... i believe that you could make the skill-less primae the mk i as such with the iteron mk i through v. thought the iteron's have always been available. so in this case the mk ii would be the same but with a few changes if you wish! i do believe it says in the devblog that we are been given a gift to test out a new ship... correct me if im wrong... make this the mk i and then do a mk ii jobbie! keeps the croud happy!the art guys spend a lot of time on the ships in eve. this ship should certainly join the orca and rorqual on the field as a permanent. i love the ship design and i'm hoping the slots and stats hold their own./singed! seed this now!
6/29/2010,"make it a bpc in an appropriate lp store, and the idea might be going somewhere. otherwise there's little idea to add more t1 ships."
6/29/2010,"i am interested in your post kali, i guess i will have to wait till tonight.if you are suggesting that the gift is too hard to kill or too unballanced, then would you oppose a suggestion to reballance a production version to be seeded into the game (in one of the ways suggested in this thread)?"
6/29/2010,"nopeyou're missing the point of a gift and most likely have distorted expectations of how good it'll be.when they say ""large cargo capacity"" think 500m3 possily 1000.i've not seen the specs yet but if it's anything more than that i'll be surprised."
6/29/2010,"would recommend bpcs or bpos be provided through ore, even if it is a pain in the nuts to get lp for them with their position in 0.0 space. it's a shame to have a neat, unique ship that i can't use because people will suicide-gank it for lolz.edit: here's a more fleshed-out proposal.ore distributes the primae now as a test prototype, to see what capsuleers will make of it. they let it go for a few months to study its usage and capabilities.once the test period is complete, ore unveils the primae mk. ii, which will serve as an upgraded version of the original primae that can be purchased from ore's lp store (blueprint copies are also available; originals may be restricted). this primae mk. ii will have an extra slot or two, possibly adjusted hull/armor/shield values, and would require a not-insignificant skillset to fly. the skills required would be split, like a pirate faction ship, as ore is a nonstandard faction and likely uses technology from multiple sources. it would also have a different paintjob and minor cosmetic changes.this would keep the original primaes valuable collectibles while the primae mk. ii takes over the functional end of things. if only blueprint copies were available, it would also keep the ship somewhat rare, owing to how hard it is to get lps for ore. this would keep the ship around and circulating, which seems to be what people want."
6/29/2010,yes please make this not a one off. bpos please.
6/29/2010,"it can carry less than a basic t1 hauler and has no tank to speak of, it's free for a reason people."
6/29/2010,you're wrong.
6/29/2010,rather than release bpos for these ships why not just release bpc's obtainable from ore's lp store
6/29/2010,"yes. i believe new hulls should be permanent. sure, the zephyr is just another scanner, but if primae is what i hope it is then it'll be unique. i also believe it could be a great tool for newer players (again, if it's anything like the ship i'm hoping for).supported"
6/29/2010,"i would have supported this, but then i saw its stats. just remove it from the game tbh, it's less useful than an interbus shuttle."
6/29/2010,post has been updated with new information coinciding with the primae's release.
6/29/2010,"as it turns out, when i was auto-linking the primae to my corpmates i noticed that there is a ""primae blueprint"" in the database, which can be linked and everything. the bill of materials tab was missing from it, but the fact that there is a blueprint for the primae in the items database is promising. unfortunately, it's not seeded on the market. even when i unchecked ""show only available"" there was no primae blueprint in the market."
6/29/2010,/supported
6/29/2010,keep it unique.definitely no to bpo.a bpc for a mk2 from the ore lp store would be ok.
6/29/2010,yes please!!!
6/29/2010,i agree.
6/29/2010,"it may have already passed, but still supported anyway."
6/29/2010,another in the line of things that need to be fixed.
6/29/2010,what? 1.49x (x means times) != 1.5%....did you fail basic math?
6/29/2010,you do not understand math.
6/29/2010,"time for some tempo!primary much like other alliances has now become victim to the nap and bore process, end result inactive & disbandare we really discussing the negativity of mass naping :p"
6/29/2010,"yes this is similar to what was intended with the op. nice features indeed.so here's an extension to what i mentioned as well. i'd say these are nice-to-have's but the op is a clear must in my view if we in the community are to get everything we can out of eve gate when we are unlucky/unfortunate to not be 'in game' with the rest of the crew.1. online awareness & contact list widgetsonline awareness refers to the visual capability of recognizing availability of persons/contacts. green = available yellow = afk red = do not disturb2. add to this potential widgets that can be added to eve blogs and webpages. these would contain standard code designed only to show a person's in game status along with their toon's portaitthese can be built from an online source which allows players to choose ""all"", ""friends"", and / or ""enemies.""just a thought. ;-)"
6/29/2010,100% support
6/29/2010,support
6/29/2010,1
6/29/2010,"pretty much this, pvp is full of risks, this is just another of those risks."
6/29/2010,bro...stop pvping on the jita undock.
6/29/2010,"supported. btw, this is not something about people grabbing the loot and running for the hills. it is about them being basically invincible, beside a suicide kill. ****ed mechanic.edit: page 20 ... sniper."
6/29/2010,you mean like the hi sec dwelling pirate corps that war-dec hi sec industrial corps for easy to no risk? the hypocrisy you guys spew is astounding. do you even think one step ahead of what the crap you say?
6/29/2010,"you are playing the same game as us aren't you? wvw is anything but simple, and thats the way we like it"
6/29/2010,d-scanner needs to be made into a tool that can replace instant local. automation is one of the requirements. it is aimed at leveling the playing field with the inevitable macro users.
6/29/2010,"not that i have any opinion about this matter.. but here's for a thought: thousands and thousands of years of technology development and it gone backwards :d at present on earth we have scanners (radars,sonars and stuff) that do not need to be pressed every time you want to scan :) however i think, that there's a judge pile of other more important things for ccp to look into. i don't have any problems using scanner atm."
6/29/2010,or just like ab bonus for assault frigates.
6/29/2010,bumping for slipping thru page 1 without anyone noticing
6/29/2010,well i think that video makers would benefit from that.. however i don't think that anyone would like to see only 90 degrees of battlefield and only in front instead of the whole area.
6/29/2010,"oh maybe i havn't illustrated well enough, but you can rotate your camera just like now, it will stay in that relative position, so for example if you look at the back, and you spam click, your ship will turn endlessly (the ship on your screen stays still but the background is turning)"
6/29/2010,"i was talking with some friends earlier and we all agreed that variations kill feeling when upgrading to a t2 ship. they should be called ""variation"". i don't know about you but i feel that variation is the wrong word to use for t2 ships with the same hull, just a new paintjob. if the case is that ccp is running out of ideas then why not turn to the community?now, i'm not an artist. i can't draw, however, i'm quite sure that there are quite a few talented artists flying around in new eden. what i'm suggesting is ccp making a thread dedicated to posting concept art of new hulls where the rest of the community can vote approve/disapprove of certain hulls to sort out the best hulls which ccp could consider implementing into eve. the result would be more variation and maybe some really neat ships.i know looks don't change anything in eve, but in that case why don't we have capital sized bantams flying around instead of dreads. if the animators have time, then i believe this could be a way to them working again. approve/disapprove?"
6/29/2010,"a simple request really.i would like the ability as an owner of a pi colony to assign another character as an administrator for that colony.the designated character, upon accepting the administrator job, would have the ability to cycle silos and be able to collect / supply resources to the colony. an administrator would not be able to change the layout of a colony or make structural changes.the owners access to the colony overrides the administrator access, ie owner looking at the colony locks the administrator out, and kicks the administrator out if he was looking first.their are 2 reasons for this request.a player might wish to dedicate only 1 char to his/her pi infrastructure and may not wish to lose control or leave it derelict if he goes on a campaign out of control range.a corp might wish to designate a corp administrator for pi and use this facility as a way of coordinating other corp mates to setup a colony and then hand it over to corp via administrator rights to designated members.(please note: this is not being proposed as a corp role to be granted, but a player privilege to be bestowed on another player)the pi interface under industry might need to change slightly to show ""owner"" and ""administrator"" columns for this new ability."
6/29/2010,supporting myself .
6/29/2010,"no. in that case you could control 18 colonies and 3 colonies/planet with one account and still only use one character. training the pi skills to level 4 takes a week and you could use your main to mark out good deposits for your alts, saving even more time.edit: with pi skills i mean command center upgrades and the other one which lets you drop more colonies, with those at 4 you could have 15 colonies."
6/29/2010,why is that bad?
6/29/2010,because you'd get the payout of three characters by using one! you're in no way limited to using one 1 character/account but if you want to get the payout of multiple chars/acc then you got to work for them all. i'd say passive income is quite useful when you can get one on a inactive char.
6/29/2010,so logging in and out three times is your idea of game balance?
6/29/2010,"now that they made a system for adding skillpoints... it would be interesting to get a system where you could remove skill points from a skill you don't need fx. (if your a pvp'er and have alot of wasted sp. in industry)at the same time i think there should be a procent of skill points lost in this process, anywhere between 25-50% would be fair.say you pull away 1mil sp from some industry skills, you would only get 500-750k to respend on other skills.a cooldown could also be added, such as 1 week to a month. where you could only take away from 1 skill at a time, and during so would add a cooldown before you could add them again."
6/29/2010,"not supported. we dont need instant fotm training with sp remap.eve is about decisions and consequences. you train those skills. your decision, live with the consequences. and you dont know when those skills get useful again."
6/29/2010,"i whole-heartedly endorse this proposal, and it is, in honesty - exactly what i thought t3 ships would be when ccp said ""modular."""
6/29/2010,yes.
6/29/2010,"no. awful, awful idea.even if ccp fixed fw (yeah, that's going to happen ) this would still be a terribad idea. not because of the limitations of complete rookies fresh out of the trial period, not because of facwar fcs (whom i know nothing about) but simply because: eve should never force a player (new or otherwise) down any path.have an optional faction warfare tutorial path; thus granting new players (and old player's alts) a ""straight-in"" to fw without the tedious standings grind (yes, i know there are already methods that allow new players and new accounts straight in to fw, but not everyone will follow that route). this would offer people who want to go down that path the chance to do so while maintaining the freedoms of others to ignore fw as they see fit."
6/29/2010,not supported!the freedom to choose your own path is fundamental to eve.
6/29/2010,"this. i have never any interest in faction warfare and had i been forced to participate, i would have quit pretty damned quickly."
6/29/2010,funnel noobs down the meat grinder? why don't ccp just give you killmails.
6/29/2010,don't force people down any path. strongly not supported
6/29/2010,"nah, the fleet watchlist is pretty good. there's a couple minor edits i might like - make it easier to clear people off en masse, add a capacitor bar, and have more than 10 people on it - but those are all either controversial or really minor."
6/29/2010,"those buttons (about orbit and keep at range) could be placed on second line of selected item window buttons:*first line with approach, lock target, look at, etc[5][15][35]it could be with the image of orbit button, but the numeric on top of them must show the current preset of orbit range, and same idea for keep at range buttons"
6/29/2010,"sharp knives are good knives for the people who can use them properly.anything which requires an extra click for basic things is an unneccassary burden on user side. do you love the ""submit"" button of pi? hope not. if you want to have things idiot safe make confirmation dialog windows optional depending on user configuration settings.i agree with you on that ""move opposing options apart"" issue, but it doesn't even end at ""opposing"" options only, e.g. ""set waypoint"" and ""set destination"" should be put apart as well in star map rightlick menues, as ""set destination"" does erase your whole route set so far."
6/29/2010,"like i said, that should be the default, but it should certainly be able to be toggled."
6/29/2010,it's simple - make info windows for structures in planet view optionally non-transparent and resizeable.
6/29/2010,yes please! for all i know i could be missing out on loads of information under that right side.
6/29/2010,"the hail ammo for minmatar is broken since 5 years. if you check the description of it it should enhance tracking. but it reduces it as it is for barrage, the long range ammo. but for short range maxdamage variant this is completely useless. of this reason is has the worst damage output of any ammunition you can feed for autocannons. simply this is broken and needs urgently be fixed. shouldn't be neither a problem nor a big deal. i propose to do fix it asap. wonder why nobody ever proposed to fix this. please support."
6/29/2010,"hail ammo is insane, but it's hardly the only t2 ammo with problems. hell, there's a whole ammo type thats borked and hasn't been touched for a while (rockets).anyways given minmatar popularity, the fact that they just got a boost and the fact that they are quite good and have many viable options in pvp, fixing hail would be pretty far down on my list. (hybrids and rockets at the very least would come before that)"
6/29/2010,all the t2 short range turret ammos are essentially worthless for similar reasons: backbreaking penalties in return for the same damage as easily available empire faction short range ammo.
6/29/2010,"fix hail and void, we need adequate t2 ammo. more tracking, or more damage. close-range ammunition should boot tracking if anything, not nerf it. maybe ccp got the signs wrong."
6/29/2010,"instead of having a special thread for hail, maybe just support this thread."
6/29/2010,"this doesn't solve neutral remote repping and it unnecessarily gimps logi pilots who are not neutral from reasonable operation. when your only option for defense is to escape, gimping the ability to escape really kind of defeats the purpose.station games are not solved by your solution, neutral games aren't solved by your proposal either, given that these are what seem to be the problems why would you expect support?"
6/29/2010,"yes, lets nerf pirates even more! imagine this: small pirate gang of 2 recons, 2 battlecruisers and 2 scimitars. they sit on a gate while the scout is in there looking for targets. they have criminal flag, so the sentry guns are shooting at them. the scimitars are shield transferring as the paper recons cannot hold out very well under sentry fire. now the call is made to jump in and engage. unfortunately the logi pilots are now stuck for a minute, and will prob not even be there in time to see their gang die in a fire.not supported!"
6/29/2010,"in the interest of free enterprise how about ""toll gates"" available to cut some travel time but charging a toll based on ship size or total value of ship + cargo. they could be run by a npc corp as a service to customers that are willing to pay for the extra safety and less time loss. it's a realistic use of gate technology and makes sense that someone would do it for profit."
6/29/2010,time + sleep = perspective. thus...rage-post modified with some measure of rational thought.
6/29/2010,much better!
6/29/2010,mynxee's blog post after day 1 of the csm summit paints a slightly less acrominious picture.life in low secit has a group pix of csm5 members too :d
6/29/2010,"ankh's report paints a pretty accurate picture of session discussion, csm frustrations, etc. i'm very curious to see the draft minutes that ccp writes up. i have requested csm review of those minutes to be sure they are accurate and accurately represent csm perspective/opinion.my day 1 blog post was written when i was still optimistic because you know...glass half full and all that. after 3 days of the same ccp song and dance, the continued resistance to commit, be accountable, or open to more integrated communication with csm (such as the ""insider"" stakeholders have), my cap of skepticism is firmly in place. blog post later today; first day back home in 8 days means rl demands attention first.also, i think my photos on facebook are public...if not, friend me and you can see them all. summit and iceland."
6/29/2010,mynx <3ty for the pics!!!!
6/29/2010,nice work/overview eva/x
6/29/2010,"i keep a close eye on the csm since you people represent me just as much as all the other eve players.i look at the forums on a regular basis and what i don't really like is that several csm are posting reports about the csm minutes and all.i thought that was what the elected secretary was for.i can understand the need to post them to show you are activly involved, but i personally would prefer if people do the task they are there for and let others do their tasks so it doesn't get derailed and makes people respond in several threads and thus making it a tad harder to see how and what.so if we can keep the csm minute reports in one post and handled by the elected person this would make all a tad more clear and easier for people to follow.thank you for your time reading this request."
6/29/2010,"ccp produces the minutes for the summit, not the csm secretary (unfortunately, but this approach is done so that the secretary can participate fully in discussions rather than worry about having to document them). the reports of others on csm are more personal opinions and observations--such as i plan to make in a lengthy blog post later today.while ccp was fairly quick about producing csm4 summit minutes, there is no guarantee of that happening this time. especially because i intend to ask for a review by the csm before those minutes are published--i took detailed notes, as did others, and i want the opportunity for us to question missing key points that we feel should be in those minutes.for that reason, it seems wise for those of us who were there to document things while they are fresh in our minds, rather than wait an undetermined amount of time that could roll into a couple of weeks or longer.teadaze or myself can make a thread titled ""csm5 june 2010 summit reports & minutes"" that gathers all the relevant links, once the minutes are published."
6/29/2010,"you have to admit that would be pretty awesome, though."
6/30/2010,still broken
6/30/2010,jump range !thats it.
6/30/2010,"yes, jump range. 50% seem like a good figure, more would be too much in my opinion. it's still a battleship.the only issues i really have are #1, the missing t2 resists (i don't undestand how those could be left out) and the bad hp, respectively. and #2, the fuel use. that is just ridiculous. let's take a prorator with 11k cargohold as example, 5 recons and 10 bombers will deplete all the fuel in about 5 long jumps?reducing the fuel use to a ridiculously low amount would even negate the lacking jump range for me."
6/30/2010,needs more support.
6/30/2010,"keep supporting this until it becomes the biggest thread in assembly hall, guys. because we all know that the only thing ccp have ever listened to is threadnaughts."
6/30/2010,agreed.

6/30/2010,"obligatory post-""patch"" support"
6/30/2010,1
6/30/2010,"this entire thread is way tl;dr.however, has anyone considered [and they might have mentioned it in this thread, sorry if i missed it] that ccp spend one release cycle just fixing bugs and getting content ""excellent""? take the long list of bugs and spend an insane amount of time and effort fixing tons of bugs [great for stability anyway], plus tweak all those lovely features until they really are ready for prime time.one release cycle. only bugs and tweaks.in the mean time, the feature team can think long, leisurely and luxuriously about new features that will improve and enhance the eve experience. then, these features [preferably a chain following the direction eve will take over the course of the years] will be rolled out, one by one, during the next expansions, to make eve the unique standard of excellence that it should be [and very nearly is].in the mean time, broken and unfortunate though new eden is in some places, it really is an awesome place to be in.i wholeheartedly support this discussion.ccp: i'm not doing this to be difficult, i'm only helping to push you ever further on the ladder of excellence."
6/30/2010,"so very much yes, slow the dev cycle to either 9 months, with 1/3 of that time dedicated to features needing fixing or finishing, or make each year have two types of expansion: the new stuff expansion and the old stuff made awesome expansion.adding more depth to pi (and maybe removing some of the click-frenzy), for example, would keep in the players that the pi expansion might bring here."

6/30/2010,yes please.
6/30/2010,"this is my first post on the eve boards. this is definitely something i'd prefer even over new content, someone suggested do a new and a review patch every year. that would make eve epic in my mind."
6/30/2010,1
6/30/2010,this is a huge thing to be fixed
6/30/2010,eve is probably the best idea of a game. i wish it was close to the best implementation.

6/30/2010,yes
6/30/2010,supported!
6/30/2010,this is an excellent idea i'd love to see supported. i'm sick of the half-baked features that get abandoned so easily. it's pathetic how many half-finished or subpar features are hanging around in the game.
6/30/2010,1
6/30/2010,do i really need to say anything?supported for obvious reasons.
6/30/2010,"supported, learning skills add nothing to the game and are just a timesink that you need to get over for every new character.plus, now that the infrastructure is there to give out sp (the free 100k sp they gave everyone for the server move screwup), it should be relatively easy to refund the sp used in training learning skills and allow us to spend it on whatever skill we want.this would be a great move by ccp, come on do it, and show us that you are not so stubborn as to stand in the face of all reason."
6/30/2010,supported. desperately needed.
6/30/2010,no. not supported.if learning skills are deemed to be removed why not give everyone them and then give the players that have already learnt them some free sp.
6/30/2010,"absolutely supported, they are a terrible mechanic. people who support them are only looking out for themselves"
6/30/2010,supported.the sooner it will be done the better.
6/30/2010,"100% support this.when friends start the game it is pretty lame to tell them that ""oh, you have to train these skills first""they want to be able to fly around a ship asap with you and whatnot ... not just sit in station for 2 months."
6/30/2010,totally support this idea.
6/30/2010,no one should have to choose between spending a month doing nothing or having a crippled character.
6/30/2010,"this is coming straight from a noob, i'll make that clear. i can respect the veteran's and hardcore's desires to keep a mechanic that they themselves had to endure in the game, and yes, it does add another level of tough decision making for the player to consider (or in other words, added depth to becoming stronger).however, i think everyone can agree that sitting around for a month (or staggering learning skills with necessary components to enjoy eve, over the course of numerous months) just isn't fun. from a purely business and logical perspective, giving noobs a month-long timesink and saying ""do it or suffer not being efficient for the rest of your eve career"" doesn't make sense. honestly, i quit eve a few months ago (note: i'm back and enjoying myself obviously) simply because i was bored being stuck with my noob ships/skills while training up learning skills.i love the rugged individualism and hardcore aspects of eve, because it does make everything have that added sense of 'worth and value', but that doesn't compensate for being bored for a whole month and (statistically speaking) quitting the game sheerly because of that hurdle.when you think about it, removing learning skills is a win-win. noobs can focus on having fun and learning skills that they deem worthy spending time on, griefers and pvpers will have new fodder to decimate (and subsequently drink from the tankard of tears) and ccp gets more money.so just refund the sps everyone has spent on them, and let all of the past players rejoice in knowing that they had a bonus-learning curve longer than anyone else.but like i said, i'm just a noob."
6/30/2010,no. removing learning skills is definitely not a win-win scenario. ccp themselves acknowledged the obvious truth that it will anger allot of people. ccp said that one day they might pick the option that would anger the least amount of people. as far as i am concerned the method that has been suggested that would probably anger the least amount of people would be to give everyone the learning skills and use the new sp allocation system we now have to give a sp re-numeration to the players that have already trained them.
6/30/2010,"do you really think veterans of eve would ragequit the game because suddenly the tedious month's worth of learning skills are gone and no-one has to deal with them anymore? somehow i doubt that, whereas noobs will, and currently are, leaving because of them. and yes, i agree, issue a full refund and give everyone the equivalent of what maxed learning skills would give."
6/30/2010,is this your justification? you dont think they will go as far as quit? just get up and run around smashing things up but carry on paying their subscription perhaps? do presume to think that they would see them as tedious?i have never talked to anyone in game that has been discouraged by learning skills. in my experience new players stay playing the game because of them.
6/30/2010,"ok, yesterday we got 100k sp because of the 1 day downtime and i find the idea of bonus sp quite nice.my idea is that characters that are low in sp compared to the number of months/years they have played, can purchase back the time they lost off the game.exemple : a character made in mai of 2006 should have aprox 70mil sp, but he took a break from the game of 7 months, so he has only 53mil.but roleplaying/game wise, his character was still ""alive"" in the game at that time, still existing, so he could if he wanted, pay the equivalent of 7 months of gametime and get back what he lost.but a character could never exceed the max amount set by ccp, calculated as a maximum of sp that can be learned since the character was created.so for players that, for whatever reason, stoped playing, could get back the sps they lost !- it can be done only once per account, (to help those who realy need it, that way it cant be farmed)- you can buy back up to 1 year worth of game time maximum, (so an old character woudnt be a possible monster)- the number of sp available is based on the average sp per month the character chosen has trained, (if an old toon just played 2 months, the average sp he did in those 2 first months are quite low, so even if he decide to buy a year back, it wont mean alot of sp)and i could add a new rule :- the process cant be done on a transfered character. (characters have to be created from scratch in the account to be eligible)with all these rules and ccp could add even more, it will target those who realy need it and with the features already available in eve, this is just another one in the same league.poje"
6/30/2010,you want to be reimbursed for the time you spent not paying ccp for their services? no.
6/30/2010,"hehe, no.i want to be able to pay for the time i didnt pay in the past and regain what i lost.ex : a character made in mai of 2006 should have aprox 70mil sp, but he took a break from the game of 7 months, so he has only 53mil.so, the guy can pay to have back up to 7 months of lost played time."
6/30/2010,"no, your saying you want to buy back the time that you didn't already pay for... ccp already made a fix for this, it's called, keep paying then you wouldn't have this problem in the first place -.- i took a 7 month break and i'm down a good bit of sp but know what tough luck, deal with it, you didn't pay then you can't pay now."
6/30/2010,if people don't play they don't get sp. it's as simple as that and it's good this way.not supported at all.
6/30/2010,i've said it once and ill say it again.absolutely frakking no.if you didn't pay for the game or play it... you have no business attempting to turn the damn thing into some sort of wow.
6/30/2010,"some of you dont understand i think...if someone stoped playing for 6 months, but he decide after to pay for those 6 months he didnt pay b4, he could have the equivalent of 6 month of sps added.since eve is a game that u can learn skills and not play, just pay and skill up, it would be a logical choice for those who had to stop, but now can pay those months they couldnt b4."
6/30/2010,"we all understand just fine.what you don't seem to understand is that you were gone, didn't pay for the game, and ccp is not going to let you reverse the results of that decision, even if you pay equivalent money.well actually i could see them doing it cause $$$, but its a terrible idea."
6/30/2010,"why is it terrible ?it doesnt change anything, except for the player who had to stop for x reason.if he never stoped playing, his character would have the same age and name, but he would have the right amount of sp.thats my point. it give a chance to those who had to stop and they didnt want to. they can reverse that error/badluck/whatever."
6/30/2010,"consequences for your actions is a core part of eve. if you can't see this, maybe you should find another game."
6/30/2010,more assembly hall nonsense.
6/30/2010,"""consequences for your actions is a core part of eve. if you can't see this, maybe you should find another game.""wow... and the guy who just stays in a station and pays per month just to learn skills has an impact on eve ? loland those who train alts to sell them, they have an impact those characters while they are learning/gaining sps ? lolits just about sps, not the sandbox effect or whatever."
6/30/2010,"when ccp announced the sp reimbursement, i thought ""that will open a can of worms"" and here we are.not supported."
6/30/2010,i just dont understand you guys...it has no direct effect on diplomacy.it has no direct effect on economy.it just helps those who stopped playing when they didnt want to and want to rectify that.thats it.
6/30/2010,"if they didn't want to stop playing, they should have bought more game time. trying to compensate people for past screwups on their part is a slippery slope with no bottom."
6/30/2010,current implementation is absolutely dreadful. bring back the folders in the name of sanity please.
6/30/2010,so you know of a way but it's too complicated to explain and your against making that easier?
6/30/2010,a good idea in the assembly hall. this does make a change.
6/30/2010,you guys really want this to become ice mining don't ya'll.
6/30/2010,"i definitely support this. i have 5 planets extracting, and typically near 15 extractors per planet. i also have a second account doing the same thing. it takes me around 20 minutes per character to reset all my extractors.i could see the ability to go to planet mode and choose to reset all extractors either of a specific type, or on the planet as a whole to the same cycle times in one set of clicks. my reasoning is that this is supposed to be a passive income, and when it takes me either 40 minutes every 5 hours, or 40 minutes every 23 hours, that is 40 minutes i am not being able to run missions, mine asteroids, interact with my manufacturing, or shoot people in the face, assuming i did that.i don't want this to be, set it, and walk away for 3 weeks and it is still running. i, and my corp mates, would like to be able to reset with many many less clicks."
6/30/2010,i would like a puppy. seriously. 40 minutes every 23 hours is passive. you're not even the norm since you do it on 2 accounts with l0 planets and you think 40 minutes work is too much? get a grip on reality mate.
6/30/2010,"i agree with the idea of having a skillset requirement for a player built line of the primae, and that it should look a little different and perhaps behave differently. having seen the stats of the ship after redeeming mine, the primae seems quite fragile, if that is to remain the ship's nature then i think a bpo seed would be better. with the noted difficulty in acquiring lp for ore would it not be likely that ground out bpcs would be sold at too high a price for the ship to see practical use? i suppose the lp price could be made cheaper but then why not just use a bpo and let the industry types have their fun with producing them?eh, well, just a thought or two."
6/30/2010,wtb interbus shuttles
6/30/2010,yes. just to stop the gankers. also a high slot or to would be nice.
6/30/2010,"the recent free ship (thank you!) has a rather attractive and unique model. to ensure that ccp gets the most mileage from its introduction, i suggest the same model be repurposed for additional, skill-based, utility ships.some of these ideas were gleaned off of forum discusions, and i in no way take credit for them.idea #1: salvage shipdespite the utility of salvagecanes and salvage catalysts, there is a distinct lack of dedicated salvage ships.skill-based ability: bonus to salvager / tractor beam length, and/or reduction in capacitor usage.fitting: large number of high slots, decent speed and cargo.idea #2: gas-harvesting shipgas harvesting ships see widespread use in w-space, nullsec, and even in certain regions of empire space. because there are no specialized gas-harvesting ships, most people tend to just repurpose cruisers and battlecruisers for the task.skill-based ability: bonus to gas harvesting yield and/or reduction in gas harvester fitting requirements.fittings: enough high slots and cpu to carry 5 tech 2 gas harvesters.idea #3: better primaea tech two version of this ship would have further reductions in sig radius, further increases in plating and tank potential, as well as a skill-based increase in planetary commodity holds."
6/30/2010,let's be honest here.yes... thanks for the new ship...a useless ship.it has no bonuses... its got too small of an overall cargo hold layout for the extreme pi... hell my industrial ship would do better.... at least i could fit a cloak on it and do what i need to do for crying out loud.seriously... this ship screams in need of a major work-over.
6/30/2010,"yes, ccp please make the primae better. honstaly id say just make 3 variations 1 for each of these ideas. the primae is to awsome looking to be a non replaceable ship."
6/30/2010,"needs more cargo space. max 1k? yeah right, not even close for pi."
6/30/2010,"darn! you beat me to the first ""primae boost"" thread! i agree. the ship is useless beyond being a newbie industrial. i also think that a ship this pretty should not only be useful for newbies with low sp. i think ccp missed a great opportunity with this ship.my proposal:this ship should have been similar to t3 cruisers, obviously not t3 but have similar user reconfiguration through the use of subsystems. ccp could have given everyone the (suggested rank 5) skill ""ore industrial"" to redeem and train. now the good bit. the subsystems:i don't think that the ships appearance should change, just the ships fitting and abilities. also, only 3 subsystems instead of 5 to force specialisation in certain fields.subsystem suggestions... i'll post some later when i figure out realistic stats but that doesn't stop everyone else posting their subsystem ideasall these items (and the ship it self) should be seeded in the ore lp store as items and bpc's. however, i would also suggest that they are able to be sold on the market, not just contracts."
6/30/2010,"supported on both counts. having a ""free"" hanger ornament is nice, but salvaging all that dev time used in creating that amazing model into something the playerbase has been asking for would be super-awesome."
6/30/2010,thathangar queen is gooda usefull ship that looks cool is even better
6/30/2010,"salvager and gas cloud harvester don't need a turret hardpoint (of which the primae has none), so that should definitely be doable.not sure on the last part, t2 industrials are already perfect for pi in dangerous areas. maybe a ""deployed"" mode where the primae acts as a customs office? it already looks like a baby rorqual."
6/30/2010,"every single one of these free ships makes me end up feeling sad. not that i'm ungrateful for the free gift, but, each one could have been so much more.making any of these into a ""real"" ship would be a much more fantastic gift to a. players, b. the artists that designed it.edit: clicking support button this time"
6/30/2010,i like the idea of it being a good salvaging ship. i think a ship that is dedicated for the role of salvaging is something eve would like to see. good bonuses would be a role bonus increased tractor beam range and speed and also a salvager bonus based on skill level (obviously). i don't even think a large number of hi-slots is necessary. four should do the trick. bring two wrecks over and salvage them. with the bonuses should still go faster than with a destroyer or salvage hurricane. mid slots one would be enough (propulsion mod).maybe 3 low slots for cargo expanders or warp core stabs?i love the ship model. the best gift ship ever. although in it's current form i won't ever bring it outside of station.the reason i would like to see it as a salvaging ship and not any of the other ideas is the ship kind of reminds me of the serenity (from firefly tv show). the scene i think of off the top of my head is the crew outside opening that wreck up for some goodies then getting nearly caught by the alliance. edited for firefly comments.
6/30/2010,"absolutely support on all counts, especially one and three. i don't know enough about gas harvesting for two but it's probably a good idea.personally i'd like a gas ship to use a modified model that looks more like a tanker though."
6/30/2010,modular design through the use of subsystems is the way forward.

6/30/2010,"the sure shot way to stop all bot players is to eliminate said option from the client. since macroers are the only ones who have reason to use it. a reason may i remind is against eula.also to prevent a counter on this make to where the game closes if you access your desktop,and have a built in function the automatically flags accounts active for a average period of time that is super human. you mean to tell me you can't tell if someone is botting if they are active for 23 hours a day, and log on at 12:00 utc everyday on the dot."
6/30/2010,you really didn't think this through did you?not supported! without windowed mode i can't easily flip between my 2 running clients (which aren't macro) and this wonderful forum.
6/30/2010,"1) macros don't care if you are in windowed mode or not;2) a lot of regular players play in windowed mode; 3) removing the option to access desktop will make impossible to access vent/teamspeak after entering the game and plenty of other useful tools;4) removing the option to access desktop will make impossible to run 2+ account at the same time, something that plenty of players do, that will give them reason to cancel the secondary accounts, thus hurting ccp.so your idea will cure nothing and damage ccp."

6/30/2010,yes
6/30/2010,"yup.. wreck should belong to the killer, not the victim.."
6/30/2010,"not supported unless the original person wrecked is immune. a problem is that suppose the guy who gets ganked wants to get his stuff back? he's flagged for stealing from his own wreck since he doesn't own it. while he may be wardecced, he may also be in a 1v1, or lost his ship from a pirate."
6/30/2010,"the current issue is that the original t2 bpo's are essentially invention in god mode. over the years the imbalance will only continue to become more profound. supplying enough isk should never grant god mode. the thing that makes t2 bpo's a 'god mode' scenario is that invention never progresses into an equal form. i suggest we change that.keep t2 bpo's as is.adding a new category the character sheet: industrial expertise. it is extremely irritating now that no matter how many times you invent something over several years, you never get better at it. if instead of continuing down this unbalanced path, we made it so that every time you get a successful invention run, you get a point in your industrial expertise category for what ever you have invented. once you have gotten a ship/ammo/module up to 100% you, and your character alone, could build a t2 variation off of the applicable t1 blueprint.picturepicture with arrowsthe exact number of successful invention runs needs to be thought over by several qualified people, however i think the images roughly illustrate the system."
6/30/2010,"if we would follow your suggestions people will come up with ""if i shoot lots of rats, i should get better gunnery skills"" or ""if i mine a lot, i should get more yield"". i dont think opening that can of worms is worth it.it would make more sense that input me/pe would influence output me/pe.but then again ... i dont see it was such a big issue.not support nonetheless.(disclaimer: i dont own any t2 bpos but i make a nice cut each month with invention)"

6/30/2010,"supported (but against mods..) there were like tons of ui fixes proposed up until now.. and what is interesting enough is that most of the players agreed to the most of those posts. i think we should look at this topic as a call for ccp to finally get a glance at those excising proposals and start implementing, rather then recreating iu as a whole. i don't hate eve ui, in fact i think that with the right tweaks it would be as good as new.i hope you did understand what i meant :)"
6/30/2010,"hershel is absolutely right. if you whant to make skills more intensive and harde to train, do that, rater then forcing people to do relogs."
6/30/2010,supported.why should other industry activities such as moon mining differ from pi? you can launch a pos for a corp so why not establish a colony for the corp as well. the idea coule be expanded to include a corp hangar in the customs office. when exporting materials from a planet you could 'launch for corp' which puts the minerals into the corp hangar or 'launch for self' which sends them to your personal hangar. if launcher for corp then the corp can pay the export tax. slight thread hi-jack but you can see how the idea fits in with an already established corp structure.
6/30/2010,"not supported only because this pi stuff is really about having a independent revenue stream for what other active tasks (mining,ratting,etc) if we allow for quick management for multi-account holders this will just become supplemental income for the multi-boxing miners and anyone doing it with just one account will get squat as far as income from it. much like how mining gives squat unless you multi-box 4+ hulks. yes look at the corp tag, this is coming from a miner."
6/30/2010,"first off, i'd like to congratulate ccp's art department. the primae is a very, very pretty ship.however. i do feel that it is a complete waste of time and resources to produce such an asset that is essentially, hanger ****. never to be used in anger due to the fact that it is irriplaceble and for all intents and purposes, useless beyond being a ""newbie industrial"".i think ccp has missed an exceptional opportunity to deliver something that many, many players have been begging for.the primae should of been a ship of great industrial flexibility like the t3 cruisers are through the use of subsystems to specialise its role.so, my proposal would be a redesign of the primae to allow for the use of subsytems to specialise the ship. these subsystems wouldn't make the primae the be all and end all industrial, but it would allow it to slot into several roles that currently lack a dedicated ship.the primae would require a new skill to pilot (ore industrial). i think a rank 5 skill would sufice.the proposal would also require the primae and the subsystems to become availible on the market or contracts. i think the ore lp store maybe the best place to seed bpc of the ship and subsystems to be manufactured.so what subsystems would be availible.industrial subsystems*the primary subsystem which will offer bonuses to the selected rolethen the navigation, electronics, defensive and engineering subsystems (5 types in all)three of each type will be available subsystemsindustrial subsystemsplanetary operations subsystem+ command centre bay (1600m3)+ planetary commodities bay (5000m3) +1000m3 per level ore industrial [yes this is an initial boost to current ship but it is required!]+ cargo bay (50m3) [a slight nerf to cargo capacity but this is specialisation]asset recovery subsystem+ 8 high slots (no weapon hardpoints)+ cargo bay (1500m3)+ 20% bonus to tractor beam range and speed per lvl ore industrialgas harvesting operations subsystem+ 3 hi slots and turret hardpoints (required for gas harvesters)+ 20% to gas havester yeild per lvl (offers the rate of 6 havesters at lvl 5 skills)+ role bonus 85% reduction in cpu requirement of gas harvesters+ gas bay (1500m3) + 300m3 per lvl+ cargo bay (50m3).......continued"

(ps my own interrest in this, is that i have a 70mil sp char, with about 5mil sp in industry, mining, reprocesing, researhing, converting even those 5mil sp into say, 2-3mil sp to be used in other skills seems like a fair trade?)ps i support my own thread."

6/30/2010,"dump alot of rank 1 skills into learning skills, max them and retrain the rank 1 skills you dumped. wait for next reallocation and repeat."
6/30/2010,/thread.
6/30/2010,agree. i'd like to get rid of my wasted mining skills.
6/30/2010,"get ride of learning yes, but whole sale reallocation is stupid."
6/30/2010,you do realize that they stated in the dt thread that they were planning on putting a sp allocation tool into the client right?
6/30/2010,"there are no words strong enough to express how much i dislike this idea. they simply do not exist. ""f'ing hell no, you ignorant moron"" doesn't even begin to assuage my overwhelming anger at seeing what is, by far, the most ridiculous proposal to ever decorate this forum. compared to this, emo tj's threads seem well considered and worthy of support.in short, no. i won't bother explaining why, because if you could understand the reasons, you wouldn't have posted it in the first place."
6/30/2010,"they have already done so, hence why you were able to allocate those 100k sp you got yesterday. it'll probably get used for gm reimbursement as well."
6/30/2010,"a friend who just joined the game recently pointed this out to me. i thought this was already taken care of, but apparently these sites are still static and are camped constantly.exploration is a very fun part of eve, but a bit lame when the sites intended for younger players are farmed to hell and back.so remove these sites from the static system and make them cosmic signatures in .8-1.0 space?"
6/30/2010,not supported.static 1/10 and 2/10 plexes in lowsec generate some of the most fun small ship pvp in game: they can easily be run in pvp ships and the loot is enough for people to fight over.
6/30/2010,not supported.the races are the way they are for a reason. don't go fiddling with that. if you don't like the way they are then train for another.
6/30/2010,"it goes against what ccp might want out of their game, but this would add a new dynamic to the game and would liven things up alot. it would get alot more people into t3 cruisers who otherwise might not."
6/30/2010,"i was playing about with t3 yesterday and looking over all of the subsystems. i arrived at much the same conclusion.t3 needs to break the mo[u]ld of 'amarr, nuets', 'mimatar, webs' and even gun types.you have to train up many more skills to have access to the other races anyway. its not as if you are getting stuff for free here. there's a heavy down-payment involved. the payoff is weak when your strategy can be 'guessed' so easily."
6/30/2010,"its not a problem with one race's ships. it's a problem that they said ""omg over 9,000"" combinations, but in reality, no one in their right mind would fit anything aside from the 6 or 7 proven setups per race.in theory, yes, you can fit 47838232238 different ways, but the modules are made in such a way where basically there are only a handful of acceptable setups.allowing for out-of-race modulation would bring true variety to tech 3 fits and maybe even allow for the lesser used modules from one race to be paired with the lesser used modules from another, to combine into something more than a joke fit."
6/30/2010,"there are usefull rigs, like the cc, which gives 15% more capacitor with no penalty. there are less usefull rigs that give you 30% resist bonus to a single paramiter with a rather large penalty. i suggest tiher buffing those rigs or reducing/removing penalty for weapon and resist rigs. there are utteraly useless rigs like warp core optimiser, that slightly reduces the amount of capneeded for warp. i believe that some rigs are unbalanced and need to be loocked at."
6/30/2010,"no support. i was intrigued by the concept, but forcing new players into fw is bad news. however, having a set of faction warfare tutorial agents at the hubs, who make clear in their dialogue what being in fw means (half of empire will send police on you, moving through lowsec, etc) and then upon final mission completion prompt the player to enroll in fw, that would be great. i'm in fw, would love to see more *well informed* new players give fw a try - i'd love to see more players of all stripes in fw. but this proposal would just railroad often unwitting players into ganks. i wonder if the op is a noob system can baiter looking for expanded opportunities. . ."
6/30/2010,disclaimer: ideas presented in here are not sensible or original ideas. in-depth coverage of the idea can be found here
6/30/2010,"fonts bigger? i hope this is optional and not like a few things they changed with tyrannis.i have a 1680x1050 screen as well. i love the small font size, but i can understand people who want bigger fonts.still, hasn't the issue always been the bad font type? like b and 8, 0 and o, s and 5, g and 6 and so on. this is something that seriously needs fixing. but something tells me some guy at ccp will have the awesome idea to just change all fonts to verdana with font size 12. if it's optional, cool. i just don't want to have my overview over 50% of my screen, the chat windows taking up the other half."
6/30/2010,"btw, excellent retrospective of the summit, mynxee!"
6/30/2010,"thanks for that second article, it confirms many of the predictions made before. this comparison between two tennis players would indicate the csm and ccp are on some sort of equal level. which of course they are not. you don't have a racket, a ball or are even present on the field. the csm would be a linesman who calls out a foul time and time again, only to be ignored by the umpire and players."
6/30/2010,"if the csm calls enough fouls, hopefully one of the players will eventually yell something along the lines of ""why don't you do it yourself then"" and then the csmees will cackle madly and renenact that scene from kung fu hustle where a short guy turns out to be a tall guy sitting on a stool."
6/30/2010,and then everyone will continue to do whatever they did immediately before that...
6/30/2010,thank you for that. i was a little boggled by the last one.
6/30/2010,"bandwagon's full, please catch another."
6/30/2010,"ccp told us for the last 3 years that incarna was basically a side benefit of wod. now they're saying they cant fix gamebreaking bugs because of all the dev resources they're pouring into it? what changed?well those resources have been spent now, but incarna had better be ****ing epic. if they've spent 3 years creating an avatar creator and space-bars while important **** goes unfixed, there will be hell to pay."
6/30/2010,"well i'm not thrilled that they seem more interested in working on pi than fw.but at least they seemed somewhat committed to making fw plexes spawn more often throughout the day. this is something, at least a little bit, bigger than just a bug fix. was anything said about the fact that very few people in fw do what is supposed to be the main focus of fw - plex for occupancy? did you or anyone get a sense of other specific ""low fruit"" they may pick off of the backlog when it comes to fw? i'm interested in all things fw. what did you guys present to them on fw? and what sense did you get about what they thought."
6/30/2010,] jareck hunter > read his comments...in the csm public channel....
6/30/2010,this whole sok v. ank drama would make a great icarly episode. but can those 12 year old girls obsessed with this junior high drama please post the details in a seperate thread? ank didn't mention it in her original post at least what i read of it. so why must every thread regarding the csm be shat on? ffs.
6/30/2010,"she tactfully forgets to mention that after she stuttered her way through her fw warfare, it was sok and vuk that saved her ass by summarizing the key points to ccp personnel present. that said, until the minutes are out there is no way to verify anyone's contributions."
6/30/2010,christ it's all getting a bit petty now
6/30/2010,"i rather enjoyed reading mynxee's last update (csm june 2010 summit retrospective). a well written, very professional piece - that it could almost be mistaken as an office correspondence for a multinational. i'm impressed at amount of thought put into due process, notwithstanding the observations noted on ccp internal workings.what i found revealing (if it's true as per your update) is ccp trying to design a csm(?) tool when they don't know heads or tails on the internal csm workings. that really strikes a chord.you'll definitely get my votes if you decide to extend your csm tenure."
6/30/2010,"why are you complimenting someone on a job well done, when there are perfectly good drama grenades to be flung into the middle of the room? i'm not sure you actually understand how jita park is supposed to work..."
6/30/2010,"in that case, please ignore my previous post.feed those two the lions please, if they continue the tantrums."
6/30/2010,"good post ankh, and glad to see it confirmed by mynxee.couple thoughts/points of note: this is craziness. it's literally exactly what you complained about, used to justify itself. come on now. i'm glad to see that csm took a united front against this, but hopefully it goes somewhere after that. getting defensive... seriously you should expect some criticism when csm comes knockin on your door. buck up, htfu! don't get defensive.awesome, very glad to hear it. it's fun right now, but there is definite honing potential. again, you've got to be kidding me. nathan is starting to sound very unreasonable, and in fact the very cause for players to feel the csm has no worth. *sigh* holy... friggin... crap. no ish sherlock. sorry guys, but *points at his own campaign* really, i'm extremely shocked that ccp would be so utterly brash as to respond this way. they're only giving fuel to the fire of the nay-sayers, and are completely ignoring the calls for help of the players! has anyone mentioned to them that by fixing these things, things that so many have left this game for, they will actually regain old subs? there's so much emphasis on new subs, new subs, that they're forgetting ""bring back old subs!"" do not be so short sighted ccp! good summary again, i look forward to full minutes. good job to the csm members that stepped up and fought hard./rant"
6/30/2010,"i don't think they'd started on anything, it wasn't discussed. but ccp does seem to enjoy springing ""surprise"" gifts on its players. my instant thought was that i could see them thinking it would be really cool to offer tools to a sure-to-be-grateful csm as a surprise for the next summit. don't get me wrong. we need some tools--dealing with proposals alone is a grind and a half. and their hearts are in the right place.but in the moment, i had this vision of the out-of-touch uncle who shows up beaming and bearing gifts for a distant niece, only to be confused and hurt at the look of pure disdain from a tattooed, chain-smoking teenager in response to his offerings of frilly pink dresses because she was not at all the child he thought she was. best to nip that possibility in the bud early and do what we can to ensure any effort expended would be aimed at producing something we'd actually find useful.(also, thanks for the promised support and your kind words about my post; i do work for a multi-national company...guess my writing style just auto-transfers to csm efforts)"
6/30/2010,"good writeup. while i disagree very strongly with essentially all of your ideas about the game, i'm not at all sure that that matters for the purposes of the current csm. there is a huge backlog of issues from the last csms, very few of which have been implemented - for that matter, we don't even know whether ccp have done anything at all with most of them. the first (and perhaps only) objective of this csm has to be to try and push a change of culture and focus on ccp, to persuade them to re-engage with the playerbase, to be more open about their plans, and to prioritise the fixing of the old and busted over the half-assed implementation of the new hotness. and on that, you and the rest of the csm seem to speak as one."
6/30/2010,"--lag specific response-- i like this idea, but i would like to seriously suggest a reverse thought process. allow the newly loaded node to keep the large fleet, but transfer the other less busy systems (not within a 3-5 jump radius) to adjacent, less bus"
6/30/2010,"so csm5 is now seen as nothing more than laying the groundwork for csm6? as csm1 laid the groundwork for csm2 which laid the groundwork for csm3 ... until csm6 lays the groundwork for csm7, ad infinitum (at least until ccp pulls the plug).insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results.anyone who thinks the csm will ever accomplish anything meaningful is truly bat**** insane."
6/30/2010,"bandwagon's full, please catch another."
6/30/2010,"if you remember skynet ai that achieved sentience in terminator, i'd say the da hu-man thought it was bat impossible too and think it's all a joke. things can take a life of its own given enough weight.i'm on the glass half-full side. what the current csm (imo) should also focus on is to campaign themselves, not only for issues often talked by the players, but also to pro-actively look at themselves and ask how can they be more accessible to the players - with the same eyes that they used looking at ccp. let me give a few examples to get a discussion rolling, the ah is troll haven and they don't have a one-stop ""eve survival"" page."
