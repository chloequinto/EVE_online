10/1/2013,"its a small trivial thing, and since connecting with your avatar is as important as enjoying the game it would be silly to have to hate your name. identity is only in a small part your actual name. there is corp history, bounties, standings, etc.it should be painful though, so you dont get trolls doing for kicks and giggles. id assume that 2b combined with a once per character would be a good safeguard."
10/1/2013,2 bil? that's just stupid expensive. make it only doable once per year and you've got your safeguard. we've beaten this horse dead already with ways for people to keep up with who has changed their name so there is no need to get ridiculous with the req's
10/1/2013,"i have a proposal that brings out a balance, cloakie camper/recon/intel still can stay cloaked with no issues, but local sov holders still have a chance to track them down. bring back the pos module ""system scanner"", but anchor it outside the pos shields. anyone with roles (create a role, hell) can activate the scanner once every 3 hrs, and proceed to use the hacking/arch minigame to launch a system wide hack burst for all cloaked ships. now, before you go nuts and say omgwtfbbq, the pulse will activate on all cloaked ships in system, the exact same type of minigame that they have 10-30 min (depending on a new skill hacking avoidance) to complete the minigame (again, just like the hack/arch sites ) it will take what ever skill the originator used as the type to be defended against. if you fail 2 times, you de-cloak and your cloaking device is locked off for 15 min. during this time, the system owners can attempt to track you down."
10/1/2013,"i am glad to see that you prefer the status quo, then we have something in common then. the op has however quite rightly pointed out that there is currently no way to interact with afk cloakies, there is no paper rock or scissors with them and this is the issue, not anything to do with being able to or not operate within the current structure, his view is that there is no possibility to interact with the cloaky in system with in game mechanics. now take your mind back to an earlier period when the trick was to get into a sanctum and stop it from despawning, this was used against people with a single sanctum, i remenber waiting until we were pretty sure that the cloaker was afk and we went through the sanctum with multiple interceptors with drones assigned to a pattern and we could not de-cloak him the reason i suggested that we make it so a top skilled prober with specific probes can get a 20km fix on them if they have a cyno onboard is part of the intelligence game and adds risk to those wishing to apply force projection, you have that benefit then have an added risk and if he does not then he won't show up at all and that changes the risk equation and people can chose to take that risk, thefeore making the camper more likely to prove himself as a threat.the issue with local is that without local people will have to mash d-scan continiously, and i have to say this is not fun, i used to do it in npc 0.0 when i operated in a contested system in stain for 6 months, and while i can do it its one of the reasons i have never bothered with wh space, though my main reason is the lack of security in terms of your ships in a corp pos. its a pain to do it, a serious pain, but if ccp would have something that did it for you then i would be ok with it. however if local goes so should all that juicy vectoring information on the star map and dotlan, because that makes it too damn easy to find active people, because to be blunt the balance needs to be right between the hunter and the hunted.it is a difficult one, that is for certain... blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

10/1/2013,"hello all,i have been playing eve for close to 8 years now and in my time i have grown to love and hate eve at the same time. i love the free sandbox experience where you make the game your own and decide how you want to play. on the other side of that coin, i hate that i have to pay a monthly subscription for that experience. the problem: many of the old guard are running out of things to train due to their character age. this is resulting in useless skills being trained so that we don't miss out on the sp, though the argument could be made that the very simple solution to this is train skills on your alt. the solution: allow people to play eve for free, but restrict the training of skills to paid ""premium"" accounts which have all the benefits of the current subscriber account. these free accounts could be restricted in some ways, but that restriction would have to hold true to the eve experience and not tie the hands of the player the way trial accounts are restricted. being able to trade, create contracts, and play the game how you choose should not be impacted by this free to play model, only the ability to train skills should be the defining factor here.[discuss!]"
10/1/2013,no.
10/1/2013,any elaboration or counter argument there?
10/1/2013,"well no one likes to pay for anything, but if you want to play you got to pay.old guard running out of things to train?! seriously? dude i have 130mil sp and i finally got a round to to training light missiles to 5..... what..no, pay to win and wot is something you seek...go play that if you wish."
10/1/2013,"part 1: yes, i understand that if you want to play, then you have to pay. but consider for a second the increased player base from a free to play model. then consider how many of those players who enjoy the game but would never have considered playing eve to begin with due to the restrictions on trial accounts bundled with the pay to play subscription model eve currently uses. in the end i believe we would see an increase in player base.part 2: specialized characters is what i'm referring to here. if you want to train industrial skills and make yourself a cap pilot while having sub cap skills maxed, then you will have plenty to train, but if i wanted to have a specialized bomber pilot then i wouldn't need all 130mil sp.part 3: this is in no way pay to win. at any point you can stop or start up a training subscription to further your skills in eve. once you get to the point where you feel you don't have to train anymore you simply stop. there are no premium items, no special abilities no one else can have, simply an alternate system where you can choose to train and pay a subscription fee, or not train and play for free but be inhibited by a skill gap. if you're playing a specialized role in eve you won't be affected by the skill gap."
10/1/2013,"eve already has it's own free to play system. which means players can use in game money to play and ccp still get rl monies. although not strictly free to play, all it will cost you is the time required to gain the isk for trade.your idea would mean a loss of income and these systems tend to be put in place when a game is dying.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/1/2013,"true, games which have already been a pay to play subscription model do only go to a free to play model after interest has been lost in the game and yearly revenue is falling below operating costs. that is not to say that free to play games solve a companies financial problems, but if executed properly they can be profitable."
10/1/2013,"being for free to play would not bring in long lasting members. this is a niche game period. it always has been, it is not for everyone, thus there is not another game like it anywhere, and that alone is worth the pay to play. plus it makes absolutely no business sense to cut your own throat. it is all about the journey man, i find my self doing all kinds of stuff and rounds out this character. all though i suffer from 5 or 6 years of nul wec doctrines, i feel fortunate to have those skills even though it looks like i have the case of adhd. my alts, i pay to play, train and focus. but if i do not pay...well then all my cyno-ho's and spies would not be online to do their job. so to that, the function of pay to play forces me to pay for my alts or not use them..kind of an equalizer. however the ability to marshal an army of free to play alts does make a huge difference and flying around multi boxing jewing up your isk not right. and as far as the skill, there are no skill gaps in eve, just in the heads of the nerds that have not figured out eve yet."
10/1/2013,"infinite cyno alts. infinite pi alts. infinite ice mining alts, rattng alts, courier mission alts, or anything else that doesn't involve much in the way of attention being paid..."
10/1/2013,"you provided the counter-argument yourself. if you feel sp will be ""wasted,"" train an alt. however, considering that no percentage of training in this game can really be wasted, i fail to see the argument that you can ever waste sp. i created this character in 2007 after biomassing a 2006 character. i still don't have every skill trained to perfection that i want to, nor did the 2006 character. i likely won't have all those skills trained for another 2-3 years. considering it takes, last i checked, about 18 years to train every skill in this game to perfection (not including the addition of new skills from the recent patches and new skills ccp intends to roll out), i fail to see how anyone can ""run out of things to train.""thus, i feel your idea is simply a cry for ""waaaaahhh i don't want to pay but i feel entitled to my space person, make my space person easily accessible while ruining your subscription model."" which, therefore, is a bad idea."
10/1/2013,"i understand your view of the skill training process and there are adjustments that might be worth considering. but for me there remains one reason that i am playing and paying for this game -- it remains the most challenging and difficult gaming on the market. as long as ccp continues at keeping the gaming at this level i'll will be here playing and paying. that's my 2 isk's worth.ccp's sand box is eve online. the sand is owned by ccp. we pay them a monthly fee to throw the sand at each other. that is all that is here, so move along. nothing more to be seen."
10/1/2013,i would like ccp to give me a pony.
10/1/2013,confirming that friendship is indeed magic.
10/1/2013,no.

10/1/2013,"listen kids. i don't care what you saw on tv or what you heard at school. do not huff, snort or drink any of the substances from the cupboard under the sink.this is why."
10/1/2013,"i would love to see this t1 fit you are talking about. from what i have seen it take careful planning of training skills, and blasters, ammo, rigs for a single solo ganker to take a t2 mining ship in hi-sec before concord pops them. (i assume we are talking about mining ships, if we are talking mission runners or a hualer than they are really, really doing it wrong)."
10/1/2013,thought it might be fun if we could get ccp to release the existing art assets for the captains quarters and get players to 'remix' them into upgraded versions of the cq as a competition.the winning ones could be included ingame somehow (purchasable from the lp store perhaps?)

10/2/2013,"the only reason i say 2bil is because it needs to be painful enough that the average scammer/griefer/obnoxious little $hit wouldnt want to do it. 2bil is high, but if you really hate your characters name, and youve hated it for awhile, 2 bill is worth it.course i dont hate my name so i can say ""it should 2.45 trillion"" no skin off my back.but the point is it should hurt the iskies enough to make it only worthwhile to people who loathe their name."
10/2/2013,"this is just semantics and pendantic to boot.the issue is that a player camping a hostile system accrues advantage while afk. if someone jumps into a system looking for a fight ratters and miners usually just safe up. if someone sits there afk from downtime to downtime after a while people will get desperate or careless.and, with cynos, one neut can become hundreds in a matter of seconds.i'm all for the ability to camp someone's space while cloaked - by active players. seeing a neut log in after downtime and stay there 23.5 hours suggests they are not being actively played. and while afk they get the advantage that other people drop their guard. there's other significant downsides to this behaviour.it disproportionately punishes small nullsec entities. the more systems you have the easier a cloaky camper is to avoid.it makes the game boring. the best attack is to log on, cloak up, alt tab and play a more interesting game. the best defence is to log in, check local, alt tab and play a more interesting game. at some point the players playing those more interesting games may come to feel there's not much point ever tabbing back which is bad for eve as a business.there's reasons eve has less than 5% of the amount of players wow hit at peak. boring gameplay is the main one."
10/2/2013,"no!but, i would pay a plex for removal of unwanted skillsyou do not get reimbursed for skill points or price of skill books."
10/2/2013,"your suggestions (the little i bothered to read of it) does not make it any easier for smaller entities to gain a foothold, since the problem isn't the fact that there are messages generated when something's attacked, the problem is the week of grinding you have to spend to grind through all the timers.what's needed is a system which doesn't have the timers we're looking at, and which doesn't let the defender wait until the final timer to come and actually defend. something like a variant of the old pos-based system, where we link the sovereignty to the planets instead of the moons, would be better, because it would make it harder to defend large swathes of space, thus making the entry into null for smaller entities easier."
10/2/2013,"streaming music through eve radio would not be a legal nightmare, these days there are 3rd party service providers that you pay a set amount to and they handle any royalties involved with the broadcast, which i would assume is how eve-radio does it (tracking the number of plays of each and every single song vs the peak number of clients during said song and then determining who to pay for each is quite a nightmare if you don't go through one of those services). i'm not complaining about the jukebox being removed, i am talking about how since they are integrating 3rd party software, they should do it with more than just twitch. eve radio would add a whole new level to the political climate of the game. also, your statement about them needing help to integrate it..... you can access audio streams in just about anything with little difficulty. hell, windows media player has a feature to do that...."
10/2/2013,"1) relying on a third party to handle matters through another party to track access back to a licensor is...look, i can't even begin to explain what a nightmare that presents.2) you're seriously underestimating the costs (legal, developer resources, etc...) that would go into integrating a third-party radio station to actively steam data into the client would be like, versus twitch which takes the directx output and stream it to twtich's services. there's no ccp developer hands mucking about in twitch when the client data goes out, and lapses in twitch's services is on twitch's head. the opposite is true of taking data from another service and piping it into the client, and raises issues with quality, customer support, code maintenance, and relying upon eve-radio's technical backend for the service."
10/2/2013,heh ccp fix sov mechanics good one
10/2/2013,is it bad that i actually understood what the op was saying?
10/2/2013,"i don't agree about the mining crystal change, but i have to say i agree with the changes to rorqual skills. nowadays, when an industry character approaches endgame, all they have left are the rorqual skills. and those skills are not polite. unlike all of the other capital skills, which are quite well-mannered, the rorqual skills are downright rude. this is off-putting to new players, and completely the opposite direction ccp has stated they will be going with regards to industry pilots.keep all skills for the rorqual polite-only. no rude skills."
10/2/2013,very bad. please do not do any more lines of scouring powder. it is not good for you.

10/2/2013,"i think its pretty clear, plex=goodccp is out to make money, its a business, not a charity.considering that in a business the single driving force is . . .moneyf2p games just use a different tactic to make their money, usually by saying their f2p but are really p2w.what ccp has done with eve is by far the best balance between making money for ccp, and keeping a balance for the players.sure you can sell plex you bought, but like people have said, shiny ships arent the end-all be-all advantage that most p2w players want. first theres leveling, just because you can afford it doesnt mean you can use it. second there is module balance, yes the dead space module reps more, but it uses proportionately more cap. third there is ship balance (roughly) meaing, oh your in a 3bil battleship, well that means jack $**** when i point you and orbit under your guns. fourth, and my favorite, the longer you think there is a way to buy a button, that you push to win, the longer youll have your credit card out continuously flooding the market with cheap plex to replace your blingy waaah mobile that once again got popped by veteran pirates who just bought your cheap plex so they can keep playing indirectly off your money. thats not only balance, thats the godd@mn circle of life! its beautiful, absolutely brilliant.dont cry about people selling plex, they are the building blocks at the bottom of the food chain that feed the world that is evedisclaimers; i have sold a plex or two to buy my blingy ships, i dont pvp, and i pay a subscription. sorry if i stepped on someones toes (the said vets)"
10/2/2013,if it was possible to mine in high sec with zero risk of being ganked then the people that build mining ships would go bankrupt.if all ships were perfectly safe then the need for ore would have vanished years ago and there would be no miners. what you are asking for is unreasonable.money at its root is a form of rationing. when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion (50% of humanity) it is clear where the source of poverty is.

10/3/2013,thank you guys for your support.also thank you for bumping this thread from time to time.
10/3/2013,"i appreciate all of the support that this idea has been receiving, and the csm did take notice. while that is good, we are going to need far more support to get this implemented. keep fighting the good fight.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
10/3/2013,"its the ability to 'see' the afk cloaker in local, not the use of a cloak which is causing the problem here. if a cloaker dropped from local (and was denied local as a balance) then it would not be possible to 'afk cloak' 23.5 hours a day' to cause players to 'drop their guard'.a cloaked vessel would have to be active to do anything.(cyno mechanics may have to be addressed here, i don't have enough experience with them to make a suggestion, apart from tie cyno lighting with the cloak drop targeting delay???)jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
10/3/2013,"as in previous arguments before this one, just be cause you cant see him does not mean he is not there. if we have no means of intelligence to know it requires a lot more effort to keep a sufficient guard up. if that were acceptable everyone would be living in worm hole space. so doing away with local without another means of gathering intel from the system your in will not work. the biggest issue is that there is a lot of empty null space due mainly to the ability of a cloaky camper to wait until someone lets their guard down , this is an issue of force projection ability that is out of proportion of the ability to defend against it. i am not saying it cannot be defended against. it is just not in balance. the end result is space remains empty or boring as no one is doing anything due to the ""threat"" of force projection. we have several good ideas, we still need ot get the attention of the csm and see that this balance issue is given the attention it needs."
10/3/2013,"ok lets take it another way, i am coming in a system that has conquerable stations. you have 15 pilots in system, i want to track them down and kill them, how do i go about doing this if you have 'x' number of pilots in station and afk?there should be a way from me, to hunt them down and kill them. should i then, have an option of hacking the station, pushing the eject button and have them sucked out in space so i have the ability to engage them?"
10/3/2013,"simple, get probes out, check d-scan, if you don't find anything then they are likely in station, so move to another system, easy isn't it. also the map shows average people in space last 30 minutes and number of pilots currently docked and active, also dotlan has the npc kills delta which gives you a very good idea on activity, and you have the new improved interceptors coming. and if all else fails you can just blast the services until they come out! blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
10/3/2013,"well then they can do the same thing and see what kind of activity etc etc etc. you have completely missed the point.the op is asking for ""interaction"" the ability to ""hunt"" a target. that is what i was directly replying to him as far as what he wants to do."
10/3/2013,"shoot the medical, fitting and repair services, tends to get a reaction, but i cannot see anything similar that one can do to a cloaky afk camper, actually the new personal depots, we can go shoot those, yipeeeee!!!!!! blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
10/3/2013,"frankly, there are two imbalances that afk cloakers highlight within eve: 1.) local chat being a perfect intel tool. getting intel is extremely important for pvp. unfortunately, our current ""tool"" is so powerful, with no ambiguity, that even the most ""dangerous"" areas of space become super-safe because you can tell at a glance, instantly, and with 100% certainty, if there is a hostile in system. to combat this, people put afk cloakers in system to deny you that sense of security. you shouldn't nerf afk cloaky unless you nerf the intel system (at least a little). 2.) hot drop mechanics. dealing with a single ship in system is very easy, and if the afk cloaker only represented one pilot, you would be an even bigger moron to stop using the system simply because it isn't 100% safe. hotdropping allows an enemy to bridge a pragmatically unscoutable force directly on top of a target that simply lights a cyno. the cloak mechanics themselves are very well balanced with local chat (perfect knowledge on who is around paired against perfect location obfuscation). really, if they address hotdrops, afk cloakying should become a non-issue for any competent player."
10/3/2013,"shooting services with a hac or recon or small gang of af's, i am not sure that will get any one excited to undock. lets be some what reasonable to what this is all about.the supposed afk cloaker (no one really knows if they are or not, none of your business any way, annoys the op to the point where he wants to touch the bad guy somehow and interact with him. again, i am talking directly to the point, a very narrow point here as to his basic want. the ability to interact with the cloaker. nothing more than that.shooting poco and or shooting services does not adress the issue of interacting with possibly afk windowlickers in the station. he is wanting to actually be able to hunt down the baddie and kill him, or at least die trying. shooting station services is not interacting with the afk dude in the station directly...now does it."
10/3/2013,"so being pinged, phoned, saying it on comms while playing wot's, thats what happens, in terms of the afk cloaky there is nothing i can do to get his attention apart from undocking a shiney and warping to a sanctum and if he is afk, snoring his head off he will ignore that juicy bit of a km. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
10/3/2013,"you are still missing it, he wants to actively interact with the cloaker, not hit the bat phone. he wants to actively hunt him down and interact with the target, period. and as far as pining peeps...it only is broadcasted when there is an actuall ""threat"". a small gang is not a threat. and it is not normally pinged on coms either. people just don't drop their game of gt5 or whatever they are playing for a small group shooting services. they wait until they are gone and undock pospreys."

10/3/2013,"multiple times actually in so called carebear alliances, and those leet pvp alliances are sure to be better at it!edit: so what i proved here is that its still possible to interact with people afk or docked in stations using the mechanism of shooting station services, i can see that it had an impact because something about band camp, what ever that means was thrown in my direction. also if anyone does anything to change local, then all that data given to dotlan and on the eve map should also be reduced in scope and accuracy, perhaps removed entirely. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
10/3/2013,"seen it multiple times? really? meh, you just proved you do not read, comprehension is blinded by your own agenda and you don't know ****."
10/3/2013,"an afk cloaky hunting mechanics would have two goals: to gank people ""afk"". to force pilots to leave the system so you can operate unhindered in perfect safety. are any of these goals good for the game? i think not!"
10/3/2013,"people shooting services and getting a reaction, of course i have seen it, been in it too.and you don't have an agenda? yeah right..., as i said the person that you detailed coming in system has a way to interact with the people in station, you should try it, unlike teh cloaky camper. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
10/3/2013,"he is talking about shooting someone in the face. the specific person in question, you know the boogey man everyone is afraid of. and please stop talking about what happens in null, you really do not have a clue. and another thing, the cloaky camper is a balance. you can't shoot the cloaky just the same as you can shoot the dude in the station. you have no idea if both are afk or not..so guess what draw. it is balanced."
10/3/2013,"you know, as far as i can tell the op's real complaint about hotdrops.just remove all the cynos and make supers use gates."
10/3/2013,"with the new soe ships coming out, shouldn't the soe corp get level 5 agents somewhere?"
10/3/2013,"this seems reasonable.... if they are in the appropriate place: for example, in their nullsec territories: pure blind! both roir-y and j-cijv could use some sister agents in the sister's stations, and they'd be a good place for lvl 5 agents to boot."

10/4/2013,"hello, that's not a troll, that's not a taunt, that's very serious... i'm tired to see my character with this annoying haircut.when i created him three years ago, he has long hair, and cool clothes... he's now something like a kind of gallente-copy-man, and has absolutely not the ""thing"" that did make me chose intaki as the race of my character ! bring us back intaki's haircuts ! that's not difficult, you just had to transfer that cool haircut of the amarrs to the intakis ! i'm waiting for this since tree years (this and walk in station, but that's not the subject) !thanks :)"
10/4/2013,"supported. my intaki character wants his long hair back and not in dread form. why was it not done with incarna in the first place? how hard can it ******* be? some of the decisions ccp makes are real wtf ccp, there are off buttons for ship explosions, missile effects, turret effects, etc. ""immersion"" does not seem to be harmed by those. so, [u]please[/u] give us a persisting off button for the jump gate and autoscan visuals."
10/4/2013,you had me until you said 'tree years'.
10/4/2013,"yes, those good old years of the trees, when earth was blue and green, and not grey and brown...seriously x)three, two, what the difference? we want back our hair !"
10/4/2013,"we jin-mei need our hair back too. i've been waiting too, tree years for mine. but seriously, wouldn't mind some long hair, and i agree on the not dreads.but if amarr give us long hair, do we have to give them sunglasses? for avatar balancing purposes? or are our glasses balanced by their hoodies?"
10/4/2013,"hair is overated imo.signatured removed, ccp phantom"
10/4/2013,"ccp ! give us the power ! the power to decide what haircut we want ! the power to decide what will be our destiny an our appearance ! add some barbers into the stations, i don't know, but do something !"
10/4/2013,"wis, barber shop? star citizen is that way ==>... or is it too soon?"
10/4/2013,i'm tired of looking like snape. did 1976 call and demand their mullets back?

10/4/2013,definitely would like my long hair back

10/5/2013,"after much discussion, i still have not received a valid argument against the original proposal.cloaky campers = no game mechanic to interact with once established in a system.consensus isno nerf to cloak as it is concerning ship fits or duration.most liked suggestions (including in game discussion) in no certain order1. cloak with cyno is scannable.2. new scan probes or skills to scan cloaked objects within a 15km area3. change local to only those who speak - add automatic d-scan for every 30 sec - add pilot transponders to d-scan for every pilot in system in space. (this will mean you have to dock to see who is in station) (ship types will not be linked with transponders)4. pilots in space that take no change or action (includes burning in one direction direction) 30 min are auto logged off .now i ask for thoughts pro and against each item."
10/5/2013,"1. i think its the difference between getting a ping or not on a cloaked ship, in this way you get the intel that they have a cyno, therefore pro but have to be special probes2. in terms of 1. yes, but not for ships that do not have a cyno, as the issue to me is force projection, so only for the ships in 1.3. i am wary of making that change to local due to the issue of force projection, that being said i have like many suggested that ccp create a new 0.0 without local and out of capital jump range of existing space, then see how that develops. the issue with the lack of local is that for solo players, people playing in low numbers tz's like aussies and those operating in npc 0.0 it becomes even more difficult. also because of this i would highly recommend removing all that data about npc's killed and people in system, otherwise it becomes too easy to find people and too easy to catch them, leading to less people in 0.0. so against.4. i am so so about it, maybe an hour or two. pro, sort ofother possibilities are to make it so d-scan does not work when cloaked, forcing them to de-cloak when active, or perhaps limit the range of the d-scan when cloaked.the issue is that i actually like it as it is, perhaps the interceptor changes will change things so people will afk cloak less. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
10/5/2013,"hi,i've moved this thread to the assembly hall forum as it's a subject for the csm to get involved in.thanks.[b]isd suvetar captain/commando [/b]"
10/5/2013,"ok, thanks for the moving so... csm ! yes, you csm ! make ccp change this and add us some hair ! you ear me csm ? go !"
10/5/2013,allow all hairstyles for all races.
10/5/2013,i feel this issue needs to be directly addressed toward the csm and to be brought forth to ccp. in an article posted by the mittani here:
10/5/2013,"with the recent revelations that ccp spawned unique ships for a player organisation to give away, gave the same organisation 30 slighty less unique ships earlier this summer, and dropped extremely rare monocles (which, incidentally, were at an earlier stage also given to the player organisation mentioned before) in an event, it seems that ccp is regularly spawning items worth many billions of isk in the name of 'community engagement'.if ccp feels this is the right thing to do, they should by all means go ahead. but i do feel it is important that any such spawn is fully disclosed, not only for the community to check who are the beneficiaries, but also because - and i think this is at least as important - to make sure the eve marketplace operates efficiently and transparently. (a stealth giveaway of 30 ships of which only 81 were known to exist makes those 111 ships overvalued, as the marketplace thinks only 81 exist.)""stay the course, we have done this many times before."" - (ccp) hilmar, june 2011"

10/6/2013,"i wish you guys would settle on one thread to whine about csm never responding. this is like putting out brush fires. you also need to decide which way you want to whine and not come at the issue from both sides.either there should not be things given out in which case you should leave out all the other deserving folks you listes and the not so deserving you added for irony.oryou shouldn't complain about things given out, demanding they be taken back and instead focus on creating a more equitable system for ccp to issue community gifts.me i lean towards the latter.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
10/6/2013,"i thought about this and would like your opinion on two questions that come to mind.1) do we want a listing of every niggling thing and who got it? a list of the first 500 to eve vegas so we can see they got a model bs? do free drinks in the bar count?2) would it generate even more tears of those who think they are also entitles ""he got a bigger cookie than me!""the secrecy issue of the isw's was questionable and i think above a certain arbitrary limit there should be a level of transparency. but not a complete tell us everything. how would you have this information disseminated and how would you combat the 'entitles' who declame that their actions are also community oriented and they want their piece of free pie as well?m"
10/6/2013,"regarding question 1.personally i would be ok with simply notifications like* the first 500 people to book fanfest will receive x.* the first 500 people in the door at fanfest will receive y.* two free drinks to anyone drinking with ccp at eve vegas.regarding question 2,i really don't have an answer to that one. if the process for determining 1 is fairly transparent & has certain requirements set out in advance it will help with that.as an example. (not saying this is exactly what i'd want, just thinking of a quick example)community groups will be chosen once a month (at most) by an internal random lottery at ccp. the pool of community groups is limited to those who have been featured in a dev blog & have not previously received a prize.i don't imagine it would make everyone happy, people would protest the lottery was biased. but at least we would have some idea on how things were done."
10/6/2013,"i am more concerned with the ingame (market) effects of spawning valuable items. anything worth more than x billion which is inserted into the economy should be disclosed; anything which is ""unique"" (i.e. not freely available via either production or lp/aur stores) should always be disclosed.more transparancy and a clear explanation of how and why receivers get selected will probably lead to less rage than the current situation, where we don't know who got what but do know that one organisation got quite a lot on at least three seperate occasions.a forum thread, a regular dev blog, a site page; anything which is public.ccp can defend what they're doing or they shouldn't be doing it. talk. explain. be considerate. be transparent. then ignore whoever is still whining.""stay the course, we have done this many times before."" - (ccp) hilmar, june 2011"

10/7/2013,"just read through all this, and must of missed something, as i am unclear on two points:1. will the cargo hold be scanable?2. when the ship blows up, what happens to the ships inside? do they explode as well, dropping their loot? or disappear like in a maintenance bay? i know we don't want fully fitted battleships dropping as loot! also, prefer calling them ""ferry class"" rather than ""tug class"". because ferries are what i do!"
10/7/2013,1. sure why not?2. imo they should...the tug should be hard to kill too ofcedit: to clarify i believe the ships should drop as fully fit
10/7/2013,"1. is a nerf to cloaks. (seems your problem here is the cyno, not the cloak)2. instant win button for gate camps.3. i would prefer so see cloaks drop from local (and be denied local to balance). this makes cloaks actually act like cloaks, and makes afk cloaking impossible.4. this would lead to massive macro usage, plus why just apply to players in space? people afk in the station are affecting you in the same way as afk cloakers....> showing up on local and being unable to be interacted with.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
10/7/2013,"jint i appreciate your point of view. 1. is a nerf to using a cyno - not the cloak. 2. unless you have a really really pro scanner no it is not., the intention is to make it difficult to scan a cloaked ship but possible.3. dropping cloaked ships from local further increases the imbalance and removes any current means of protection. this would make a cloaked cyno ship an unreasonable amount of undetectable force projection and just the opposite of this argument. 4. ccp has macro detection software and accounts using this is against the eula and would be banned. please keep in mind this argument is two fold, i am looking for more solutions or a better granularity of the ones presented.players should be active, mechanics should support this. there is not current mechanics for interaction with cloaked ships once established in system."
10/7/2013,"if your intention is to claim that player should be active, then your solution should address all inactive players, not just cloakers.as for your reply to 1, making a ship scannable just because it has a cyno is a nerf to the cloak. if your problem is that a cloaked vessel can drop a cyno, then address that fact. ask for the cyno to be tied into the drop-cloak targeting delay or something.2. even with a crappy scanner all it takes is one ping to tell you if a cloaker is close to you. this has nothing to do with 'finding an afk cloaker' as they will not be within 15km of a warpable point anyway.3. once again it's the cloaked cyno ship thats a problem..... starting to see a pattern. deal with the speed of a cyno pop and you are golden. 4. go to jita, so many people sending the same spam chat every minute, 23.5 hours a day. thats a macro... ccp does eff-all. 4. buy a wiggler, its a usb device that flicks the mouse one pixel left and right at a high speed. used to keep machines from going into power save when you dont want to adjust the settings.also ""there is not current mechanics for interaction with cloaked ships once established in system""there are may ways to interact and deal with a cloaker in a system. not to mention, if you are that adiment that its 'your' system, why not protect it and not allow a red to become established in the first place.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
10/7/2013,are you actually suggesting and supporting that i and others use attachments and software to enable afk game play? and if you are do you realize that you are advocating people to violate the eula?as to the rest of your arguments i suggest you re read all the previous arguments.
10/7/2013,"as this does not violate the spirit of the rules, ccp would not care.seriously, you can get the same effect from a mouse with a flaky optical reader on the wrong surface.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
10/7/2013,"indeed. let's be honest here, afk timers would simply not work. too easily bypassed and without breaking the eula.plus ask yourself do ccp even want it? seeing as afk players have next to no load, but add numbers to the server, i doubt it.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/7/2013,"i just watched a video of someone warping under the new warp system using an interceptor which of course has immunity to bubbles, the speed is just amazing and i think that even the most hapless gank bear who required 2 minutes delay on local should be able to catch something. the fun part comes in that it changes the way that he game works to a huge degree, local is not really that much of a protection, in that you will have swarming masses of interceptors running ahead of the roaming fleets. on many afk cloaking threads you chaps have gone on about local being the reason for afk cloaking as people cannot catch anything with local, so you can imagine my interest in seeing just how this pans out and the impact on the those afk cloaking if what you said is true.in terms of the mouse thing, yeah that would make it difficult, good point even if it is technically against the eula. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
10/7/2013,and it would be a great hunting ground for people running missions in carriers too.
10/7/2013,"really, this sort of reply is coming from the exact people we elected to whine on our behalf? how about a third option where you speak to ccp and tell them this was a dumb idea, and to simply apologize? then leave it up to ccp to work with the csm to come up with some ideas on better practices while handling community gifts.it's not that hard of an issue to handle, but apparently the csm taking rude and insulting defense of ccp on this is making it far more involved. poor play ccp and csm, so far.....this really could be put to bed quite easily."
10/7/2013,"wasn't going for rude. not my style.but tell me, in what way would you see that this could have been 'put to bed quite easily'.i said where i stand. how about you?mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
10/7/2013,i guess you didnt read this thread... that was posted a week ago.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
10/7/2013,"the only person whining here is you. never once did i state the csm quote ""never"" reply. if that were the case why would i make this thread in the first place? perhaps you should have contemplated the csm position entails more than a free trip to iceland...thank you for a warm and more than adequate response and being a shining example of why the csm truly are the players ""voice"" in new eden."
10/7/2013,indeed a week ago. on a subject entirely different from the one we are discussing here. perhaps reading between the lines and speaking out sentences slowly can paint a better picture for you.
10/7/2013,"wait did you seriously write this? why should it be my focus on creating a more ""equitable"" system (whatever the f&^% that means) anyways? isn't that your job? no of course not! why perception being 9/10's of the law, ccps's checkered past with t20 and other entities garnering favoritism, and the more recent embarrassment over other somer practices why surely! who would have ever thought we'd need a more ""equitable"" system for dividing favoritism?yes a daft idea i agree completely. or rather i have an idea for you. i never voted for any of the csm here (i voted for monk personally) because i already knew my play style and voice would never be represented anyways and your cold and begrudging response proves my gut feeling correct.however that being said one would think as an ""elected"" member of the counsel of *cough* ""stellar"" management you and others would actually hold ccp's feet to the fire instead of bitching about the very people you represent asking for exactly that!so my idea is simple. do your job. instead of throwing your arms up and kicking your lego blocks and going home why not listen for once? why not understand that trust in ccp's practices have come into question before multiple times?why the very creation of the csm was in turn due to a breach of this trust! you are supposed to be an emissary of that trust. and quite frankly you and the rest are doing a very **** poor job of ever convincing myself or anyone else that we can truly ""trust"" ccp to not be favorable toward an entity again.their very actions past, present, and yes potentially future have proven this time and time again."
10/7/2013,"ok, fine, i'll bite, post signer. an ideal and equitable system must have the following qualities:1. rewards given by ccp must be entirely impossible to monetize. (i.e. not items that can be sold for isk, or used to gain additional isk) [the only exception being alliance tournament prizes/ships or similar ingame events with open enrollment and correctly publicized]2. complete disclosure of the process used to select the people who received the non-monitizeable items or honors, and how ingame entities can become eligible for them.3. complete disclosure of who received the items.bottom line, no free isk, no transferable items. find other ways to honor people, put up monuments in their favorite systems, put constellations of stars shaped like a group's leader's smiling head, viewable in their home region (do this with mittani and deklein please). do something creative for god's sake, in a game as big as eve, i'm sure ways could be found to honor communities that do not involve large amounts of rare ships given to people behind closed doors."
10/7/2013,"see? now this is what i was looking for.1) about the only way i can see there being no isk value is if we did some sort of 'bound items' gimmick locking it to a character. not entirely bad, but a bit artificial. 2) transparency, while i agree wth this one strongly you might want to set an arbitrtrary 'petty cash' limit for minor prizes. so there is an encouragement for more people to get smaller things rather than one entity to get it all.3) the petty cash line might keep us from being inundated to the point od the signal being lost in the noise but other than that? hell yes saying that stuff gets given and to whom is a good idea.now how do you feel about prizes for less than ttally open events, say a pvp tourney at fanfest or vegas? it is only open to those who paid to be there and in that respect, limited. same question to any swag gifts at live meets. would you expect complete tranparency of who and what in all of that?and yes, i end damn near everything with the m, think of it as part of my sig, above the linemmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"

10/8/2013,you know perfectly well i'm not advocating any form of eula violation. i'm just pointing out how easy it is to bypass any type of afk kick-out.not to mention that the two that i pointed out are not eula violations anyway. if they were then jita would be a much quieter place. (to be quite honest i wish macroing repeat messages to the local channel was a violation)jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
10/8/2013,"step one: be prepared. done. this means being aligned or in a ship that aligns fast enough to make no difference.it may not be the most efficient way to work pve, especially compared to a min-max fitting, but it makes me impossible to catch unless i screw it up first.so long as local lets me hit warp before you have even loaded grid, you have no chance to catch me.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
10/8/2013,i like receiving all the good arguments and discussion.please lets remember what this thread is about. interaction with cloaked ships. this is the situation - ship enters system finds a safe and cloaks up. later people come into system or log on. following the only protocol that is safe for this situation is to stay in pos\station or leave and go somewhere else. this leaves the system unused and effectively shut down as there is currently no mechanic in place to know a. is the cloaked pilot active or notb. is the cloaked pilot carrying a cyno c. is there a threat of force projectionthere currently is now mechanic that allows you to interact and remove this threat if they never uncloak. i know i have heard all the arguments and it leaves much to be desired as i am pointing out an imbalance. if no one approves of the suggestions made. scannable cloaked cynoscannable cloaked ship with probes and skills.removing local and adding in new intellog off mechanics. then please give me a viable suggestion for a mechanic that allows me to if not hunt and interact with a cloaked vessel under the above circumstances. then at least interact and remove or change the situation after a reasonable period of time.
10/8/2013,"first off, your foundation is flawed. the system is not shut down.you can still operate, if you do so as part of a group, or make preparations to deal with hostiles directly.what do i mean?go, undock, do pve with others covering you. a group working together, even with individually weak ships, can handle threats.worried about a cyno? block them with a jammer.worried about covert cynos? don't be easy to kill. covert hostiles are more expensive to put in the field, and that is how they are balanced.if you can't beat em, leave: fit stabs, plant bubbles around your gates, use smart bombs, align to your exit.one or more of these strategies puts you back in the game.in null sec, effort is the price of admission, and if your opponent is making a current effort, you need to at least match it.as to limiting cloaked ships, they are already balanced. the most agreed upon trade off for detecting them in a new way, is to require effort for the existing method.this translates as: not being listed for free in local as a trade off to being able to scan them down.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
10/8/2013,"thanks for the reply nikk, but as you know you have not addressed the issue. if i was a renter i might agree with your tactics.as one who does pay the price to live in null, and again i do not rent. i want to remove hostels from whatever systems i want to use. here are some facts to keep in mind.if i did not want local -i would still live in a wormhole. there is still a lot of that space left unused as well.if i wanted to gimp my pvp fit to escape i would simply rent space - note i'm not a big ratter, and yes i mine but it is not my main profession. as to intelligence gathering and system use, technically speaking no the system is not shut down.let me ask you this, how many empty systems do you fly through to get a fight?having the ability to deal directly with a cloaked ship gives more options to pvp. it also would give more options to those who would use the space for things other than sitting around afk.it would also increase the amount of people willing to use space in pve fashion and would provide more targets. as some have pointed out, i for one am looking forward to the new interceptor balance and its new role along with warp changes.this alone is said to make afk cloaking obsolete. i do not think so as there are many out there who either looking for easy isk by sitting in a system waiting to be paid to leave or have a grudge to grind and want to deny space.afk cloaking is a cheap way to cause disruption in a system or constellation.that is what i am seeking to balance."
10/8/2013,"answering the underlined more specifically:i don't go looking for fights so much, i am a miner.as such, i rely on hostiles to act as a filter, and get rid of those who would also be miners.i prefer if they are more effective against other alliances or corps, but either way the quality of my efforts is more significant rather than the quantity here.as the hostiles are mostly impotent on this aspect, i instead observe the returns on my time being somewhat limited.the problem you are facing, is that hostile free environments are not normal. if you avoid them too often, you lose the will to take risks or operate at all with them present.being around players flying spaceships, who want to blow you up, is the point of the game, remember?call their bluff. make them unwilling to risk confrontation instead, or take it on your terms.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
10/8/2013,"*laughs softly* i like this answer.my bounty currently is 39 612 223 isk. i have it now for a long time. i would say i nourish it, because i got it from someone i respect in game. however, i do not fear troll bounty, i do not get attacked for it or anything else. there is no real effect for it.of course i am living currently with my clan in minamatar space. so in high sec, bounty is not worth much without being a suspect, criminal or an active kill right.take others for example. my favorite example is here karl strane, who has earned a solid ganker reputation, with a big bounty stack. however, you will hardly be able to earn the bounty since he flew as long as i saw him fast locking destroyers, worth only a small faction. and the payed bounty is payed on the base the ship you fly, not the bounty you have.if something should be changed by concord it is that if you got caught in the middle of something serious like being a suspect or criminal or a kill right as been applied to you a multiplier should get active to get a nice portion of the bounty set on you.i believe that this would benefit the and would be in favor on the opener speaker since you need to do something. maybe it would be also nice to ""buy"" a kill right. the higher the bounty the lower the price. but maybe the potential for abuse is to serious for some?as of now, i take bounty raise on my head as expression of likes."
10/8/2013,"why is this thread still alive? are we doing a ""head on a pike"" thing here?"
10/8/2013,"no, we're hoping for bounties"
10/8/2013,"(( okay, cant answer this as aischa.i clearly doubt you have heared anything from geb<U+FFFD>hreneinzugszentrale (gez) ?they are matter of effect a nightmare to google over the last years. at least from user perspective, but i guess for google too.they demand damn lot of money if you are able to play something. the fact that the windows media player has this function does not mean microsoft has not payed some agreement for it or does diobolic things with your computer - like drm - to enforce these rights on you.i respect the descision that the jukebox went missing, i rather have a good game then a bad player. you get wonderfull and a lot better onesm, then eve yould offer.for radio fire your favourite player up and alt-tab from the game. i guess radio does not need much attion, does it?my regards!))"
10/8/2013,"and, juste to say : that's not a joke, i want my hair back ! there absolutely no reason to refuse to allow me grow my hair !"
10/8/2013,"alright, you answered me fairly, and i'll respond in kind. i worry that even that might not be enough as people would still be able to hock the character with the bound items for isk, still, binding might be a reasonably good way to dissuade sales. more importantly though, i believe that communities should be honored through non-monetary means. look at the kings of lowsec event, the winner's flag was hoisted at ccp hq. that's the kind of recognition i mean.well one way or the other, disclosure is important, even relatively immaterial things should be disclosed in my opinion, though i'd be fine if they only disclosed material gifts (assuming the materiality level was within reason).yes, all should be clear, in the open, and in a place that can be found without pulling teeth.as to fanfest + vegas event in-game benefits, i suppose i would be fine with it so long as the gifts were suitably immaterial in isk value, and announced well before the event begins and while the event registration is still open. i'd shy away from too much value on these items as it would be more painfully discriminatory against people who can't afford travel otherwise."
10/8/2013,"ccp have decided to lock the other thread, and refer users to threads that are about the prizes somer were publicly given in order to raffle offwhich is kind of an entirely different complainthmm, odd how they'd try and deflect and misrepresent it like that"
10/8/2013,not going to quote for the sake of quoting but thank you to both the above folks for their answersnow to get them into ccp's mindset.m
10/8/2013,"oh hey, that constructive conversation on this topic. i was looking for that. here is where it was hiding."
10/8/2013,"thanks mike, if you can drop any return you get from ccp in here (that isn't nda'ed) that would be appreciated."
10/8/2013,"if things work right i won't have to report because ccp will be announcing decisions/changes/whatever themselves.that is how i would like this to resolve, anyhow.m"

""the mess that is corp management<U+FFFD>"" needs fixed bad. it's just not intuitive or easy to use, a lot of things don't make sense. some things are too ambiguous and others are so narrow focused that you have to keep adding things in until it works. then that person has so many permissions they might as well be a director. pos permissions are definitely the worst though imho. it amazes me that anybody even wants to run a corp at all and has put me off from trying to grow the corp in the future."

10/10/2013,"exactly my point. they need to clean it up and make it a more streamlined and sensible process. furthermore, i also feel there needs to be a base fee for corp creation/management/maintenance to discourage people from making a bunch of garbage ""tax dodging"" corps. all in all the whole entire field could use some attention! ^.^"
10/10/2013,"i will not support the removal of corps for the purpose of ""tax evasion"". spreadsheets online, ok...irs online? no way in hell.taxes aren't something that you should have to pay just because."
10/10/2013,"i see that got misconstrued a bit. firstly let me point out, a fee for creation/maintenance of a corp is not my primary request. just some love to corp permissions is, and i would be happy with that. however, what really should be done is an entire overhaul to the business and economic side of eve. after all the game is based on an economy. please note, i'm not saying enforce taxes ""just because."" look at alliances. they cost 1 billion isk to form and have an upkeep fee of 2 million per member corp. this--on a psychological level--prevents everybody and their brother from making their own garbage alliance and cluttering the skies with a bunch of ""one corp"" alliances all peacocking that they are some massive conglomerate . i am recommending that--as part of a larger update--we add a base cost of say.... 100 million to form a corp and say 200k isk per 50 members per month. this would--on a psychological level--be enough of a deterrent that it would remove a bunch of the 1 man corps from the record as well as serve several other useful functions. also, i can tell you first hand that this amount is a joke sum as it costs about 2-3 million isk per month to rent a station and about 80 mil or so to run a small pos per month. its primary function would be again, a deterrent. the main benefits immediately noticeable without additional programming would be: massive decrease in the rate at which namespace is being consumed. idk if you knew this, but alliances and corps share the same namespace, my alliance had to be named sovereign stars (plural) because sovereign star was a corp name. furthermore, it took forever to find a ticker symbol because alliances and corps share those too and we eventually had to settle on ""so"" because nothing else was left. namespace is reserved forever, even if a corp closes, so this alone is a serious concern. consolidation of existing and potential corporations, leading to the average corporation size being much larger, making it a more likely that your corp and its function will be recognized. look at red frog black frog and blue frog, some people still don't know about them because there are so many garbage corps to look through. in fact as far as i know they do not have a competitor! even if they did it would be hard as hell to find out who it is. a corp should mean something and be recognizable. ease of recruiting, because less people would want to pay the fees to make their own corps, and the fees would be easier split across more people. increased size of the npc corporations leading to more experienced players being in reach of newer players, which goes hand in hand with ccp's new player training they want to do and their complaints about how specific knowledge is so far out of reach of many newer players. however, the biggest benefit comes with point number 2. increased recognizability. this would pave the way for those pesky stocks to actually mean something. i mean the main value of stock comes from its perceived value. the more well known and successful the corp, the more it is worth on a market. that said it would be nice to see a stock market emerge in which corporations that were both a) a certain age and b) of a certain size could become publicly traded and sell their stock for some quick cash. this feature of course would be part of an expansion that would also include a complete revamp to the contracting system making it viable for internal infrastructure, a revamp to permissions so that it would be easier to make several ""jobs"" within a corporation, and of course many updates to the ui that would increase ease of market interaction. namely a button in the fitting panel titled ""buy all"" or ""buy and fit"" which would buy all of the modules available at the station that you did not have, just like if you were browsing and hit the buy button from the descriptive panel (rather than the view market orders button). some other features would include a the ability to sell bulk amounts of items all at once just like right clicking and hitting sell. of course it would pop up warnings for any item that was about to be sold for well under market value, just like it does now. the fee for the corp would only need to be implemented if we were to add all of these other features that required a reduction in the number of corps and an increase in the size of the ones that existed. i would not necessarily want it to be added under the current context, as then it would just be a needless fee. edit: as an added note, in order to balance this new economic sink, there would be a new economic faucet, which would likely come from a revamp in the base pay of missions to be higher, and/or an increase in npc trade orders. ccp would be well aware of this as historically they have always tried their best to steer the game's economy away from depressive states... well without making it obvious that that is what they were doing of course."
10/10/2013,"yes it does nerf something. cynos. that's the entire point of your suggestion. your suggestion specifically exists solely for the purpose of nerfing cynos. come out and say it. have conviction for your ideals. don't start backpedaling before you've even begun. if you believe cynos have to be nerfed, then convince me. good luck on that, though. your suggestion is so completely rediculous and over the top that i'm not even going to bother aguing against it."
10/10/2013,"i'd prefer that if a system has at least 1 belt, the belt(s) contain enough ore in volume, that that system can be upgraded to level 1 industry in one go from one downtime to another.without the need for industrials to have to open up and clear combat anomalies and mine in those who contain ore.ofcourse, everyone keeps saying it's totally understandable. nobody would however like a mission/complex, where the goal of the mission appeared after a certain ore type was mined out. the community would be in an uproar."

10/12/2013,1
10/12/2013,"i just watched the video for the upcoming new patch and when listening to the section on certificates i had a thought of a way to reward players who reach level 5 for a certifigate group.the devs talked about players wanting to become ""awesome"" by getting all the skills in the new certificate groups skilled so they can say they are certificate level 5 in say navigation or gunnery...to make this an added incentive what if there was a bonus applied to players for reaching level 5 in each certificate group...so say gunnery certificate and reaching level 5 u could get an extra +1% for all skills in the certificate group....in the same vain as the implants and having all the slave/crystal/snake etc implants and getting a bonus for having all in the set..(restrictions could be imposed so skills found in multiple certificates could not be exploited to gain multiple gains..ie only +1% for any skill no matter how many level 5 certificates the skill, is found in)the bonus could also vary and +1% was given as a basic example but other things like an extra skill level so essentially they would be level 6 in those skills could also be done..this would entice players to train all the skills to gain the level 5 certificate rather than what most players do and train a skill to level that allows them to use a module/item and not worry about the certicate that is attached to that skill..it also rewards players who have patiently been with the game a long time and have trained the skills up to level 5 and adds the factor that not all players are clones of each other with identical skills as not all will have the level 5 certificates.as it looks like now the system will be very nice but players get nothing for actuall achiving a level 5 certicate apart from bragging rights..a bonus would give motivation to skill those long skills up to level 5 to achive the certificate and get that certificate bonus on top on their skills..example....some1 with all gunnery skills up to level 5 would obviously qualify for the level 5 certificate and therefore get a +1% on all skills in the gunnery group....but some1 who only trains certain gunnery skills to level 5 and then moves onto other skills would not qualify for the cert or the bonus.this in turn means when these 2 toons meet and battle it out the advantage would slightly be with the person who has the cert bonus as it should be for some1 putting the time and effort into his skills and being a master of that group/certificate..this now means certificates actually are worth something in game instead of just a ""woohoo"" factor ""i finally got he certificate"" thing..this mechanic is already in game for the implant sets and i believe it would not be hard to include the certificate groups into the same mechanic in game..ie ca1 ca2 ca3 ca4 implants all get set bonus which affects all aspects of ship flying as does all the low and high grade implant sets.for consideration..."
10/12/2013,no.
10/12/2013,"not unless they introduce level 5 missions for pirate factions and the rest of the sub-factions. that's a hell of a lot of missions to add to the game.soe is not an empire faction. it is a sub-faction like the pirates. as such, it should not offer any missions of higher level than the rest of the smaller sub-factions."
10/12/2013,"i agree, every faction missing them should have each level of agents. (with the usual caveat of no level 5 in highsec).it's not like you have to create new dungeons, just copy paste the missions from other factions."
10/12/2013,do you have a source for that statement?
10/12/2013,"the years of wailing to the csm and ccp to allow the ""little"" guy to have have the ability to poke the ""big"" guy in 0.0 using small groups of players. the problem like most ideas the player base come up with is the fact they are so focused on what they want in a such a narrow view, they do not even understand that once you allow this to be, everyone, including the bad guys you and others want to nerf so badly will take the same tactics and punish you with it.and thus this swirls own the shitter as the push continues for a e-honor solution to have wot type conflict that is arbitrary and artificial. tl;dr:the game is too hard, i want to change the rules.."
10/12/2013,"new rule: people i like have a 99% resist, speed and lock range bonus and new rule: people i don't like have a 99% dps, speed and lock range penaltyat last, with this simple fix, eve is finally perfect."
10/12/2013,"what an incredibly non-constructive post.could you please address the original issue itself, instead of making sarcastic comments that add absolutely nothing to the discussion?cynos are a way to project power across many systems. combined with t3 nullified cloaked ships that are practically invulnerable, we have a situation where that projected power can be brought to bear with little risk in return. after the warp changes are put into effect, we'll also have to deal with cov ops ships that can enter a system and warp to an asteroid cluster in 10 to 15 seconds, and light a cyno.that isn't much time to react."
10/12/2013,"perhaps you should have some combat support ships to counter these fast cyno ships... such as, but not limited to...- griffin/kitsune support: people can't kill anything they can't pin down. with the cyno ship jammed (and thus unable to point anything) it takes a good 5 to 10 seconds after the cyno ship has landed, decloaked, and popped the cyno for people to jump in and load grid... by which time you should be gone (because you should have been aligned and/or aware of hostiles in system due to local).- artillery support: scared of that stealth bomber or interceptor? have 2 sensor boosted thrashers fit with artillery on-grid with you. pop the sucker as soon as he/she lands (which should be easy as these ships don't have a tank... even when tanked)."
10/12/2013,"example: if i have an 8.0 or better standing with a corporation and i want to find the nearest station that has a medical facility within the corp. i know i can look at the corp info and see all the stations and locations they own but it is slow searching that way. maybe, make it an addition to agent finder. just add all the services to the end of mission types when looking under a corporation.my ship finally came in but it was the kobayashi maru!!"

10/13/2013,keep in mind to move a ship in a different direction a click is required as such a button would need to be pressed.
10/13/2013,local is a great if you are not nrds...however these guys are and thus self inflicted.
10/13/2013,"hey,so, to make things a bit interesting and to give people the chance to cause some mayhem, remove all notification mails when a structure is under attack.think about for a moment.you can leave a pos, tcu, ihub, station, poco etc all sitting in space and never have to keep an eye on them simply because as soon as somebody fires 1 shot, the owner will get a notification mail.by removing the mail notifications it will allow people to make sneak attacks on these structure.as far as i am concerned if you put a structure up, it is your responsibility to keep an eye on it."
10/13/2013,so...make the game more frustrating for structure owners and drastically reduce the number of fights then?
10/13/2013,"ccp is moving away from nauseating tedium that favours larger organizations, not toward.shouldn't have paid for that game design degree from the university of phoenix, bro."
10/13/2013,you could argue it removes fights or you could say it creates more opportunity for smaller entities to put some hurt on the bigger entities.there are so many pos's put up in systems which are rarely used simply because if anybody attacks them you get a instant notification.
10/13/2013,"and when someone comes along to poke the pos for fuel, silos or whatever, the small guys are just going to get a hundred dreads dropped on whatever they've put up, surely? is taking down, say, a pl staging pos somewhere in lowsec really worth the effort and energy given what will happen to everything you put up?and you could argue that, as has been said, it forces people into bigger groups so they can keep an eye on all their stuff.and you have still not countered the removal of fights."
10/13/2013,"you could also argue that the larger entities have the numbers to really make this hurt in the timezones the smaller entities do not have representation in. thereby making it more useful for them.grr, goons."
10/13/2013,"this is true as well, however the way i see it the more stuff that gets blown up the better :)"
10/13/2013,"while stuff getting blown up is always good, this suggestions hits malcanis' law pretty hard, not gonna lie."
10/13/2013,"you'd think that people in the space-future would have come up with some pretty nifty ways of telling if someone was shooting their things. like house alarms, but for giant mechanical monstrosities with soul-crushing tons of hitpoints.oh, wait, they did."
10/13/2013,"in our world laundry machines can text/email you when you need to come get your clothes out. and you want me to think that in the future, they wouldn't have notifications saying ""hey somebody is shooting at me, better come check it out""? really now? just from a practical standpoint, these notifications should stay in."

10/14/2013,initial post edited to bring the ideas of this discussion forward
10/14/2013,"this not an open discussion, it is a closed and narrow discussion. you want everyone to stay with in the perimeters you set. if yuo want an open honest discussion you are going have to listen to the player base that practices such tactics. you know the tactics they some how prevents you from doing whatever it is you have to do. it has been brought up many times and yet you have not explained how an afk cloaker prevent you from doing anything."
10/14/2013,"this is an interesting idea for the old certificate system. i can somewhat see the logic behind it; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts type thing with regard to studying things. but i think that balancing it with the new system would be difficult. it'd also give advantages to veteran players, which isn't the direction that ccp has been going. but if they were tiny advantages, say 1% or so per certificate level, it could be primarily cosmetic."
10/14/2013,"this already happens. someone will still fly out to the structure to investigate:a) who/what is attacking it, andb) when it comes out of reinforcedstructures don't need to be watched in the same way that corporation assets don't need to be watched... just don't be shocked when some spy has stolen all your ****."

10/15/2013,i'm not a fan of local as in intel tool and to a lesser degree i'm not a fan of ships that are completely unscannable. i don't see the removal of local happening in k-space any time soon as too many people are opposed to it. however if the new warp mechanics allow for a substantial improvement on the ability to catch people at belts and titan bridging to some effect was rebalanced does anybody see a scanning down option for cloaked ships?
10/15/2013,not unless i can shoot whilst cloaked.as it stands i can not do a god damned thing while i am cloaked.
10/15/2013,can't support this.you would just be widening the gap between new and veteran players if the bonus was significant enough to be meaningful and if it wasn't what would be the point.
10/15/2013,"nrds only applies to shooting people, it doesn't mean we just merrily go about mining while neuts are in system. a neutral that pops into local provokes the exact same response as a red, so i'm not sure what impact that has on anything.the big difference is that we're close to empire space, and have a high population. there are people constantly roaming around looking for targets. and that's fine, it's far more fun than living in deep null where you can go 10 systems without seeing another player.sure, it adds risk, but risk = fun... up to a point. once you reach that point, people stop risking things and go elsewhere. then nobody has fun, even the people doing the drops, because there are less targets to shoot at."
10/15/2013,"i'm sorry... let's be frank: hotdrop: bringing in a pragmatically unscoutable force directly onto the field of battle capable of fully engaging 10s after the cyno goes up is a bit overpowered. i agree that the ops suggestion is not a good solution, but your being delusional if you think hotdrops are ""fine as is"". i personally believe the time to ""traverse the bridge protal"" should be mass based. a frigate can do it very quickly (few seconds), a battleship should take much longer to hit the field (30 s). ships with their own jump drives wouldn't be altered by this (so you can bring in capitals and bo's instantly). this is a much better balance than ""you can't target for 60s after bridging... uhg""."
10/15/2013,"fyi: after you jump, you have an 1 minute (or is it 30s?) invulnerability timer as long as you don't activate mods. furthermore, bubblers don't need to target to put up a bubble."

10/16/2013,"i honestly think that allowing the new deployable cyno jammers to block cov ops cynos would be the right thing to do.people will still be lazy and not use them, but for those that want to go to the hassle and expense of setting one up, it would afford them some measure of protection.ideally, i'd also like to see a module that could be fitted to a ship that would prevent a cyno from being lit... you could even give it a cooldown from being immediately reused. that would put a little more risk on the cloaked and nullified t3s that roam everywhere in near invulnerability (unless one makes a mistake).just like when you engage one, you have to wonder if it's got a black ops cyno fitted, now the t3 pilot has to wonder if you have a cyno jammer module fitted.more risk, so everyone should be happy with that, right?"

(they dont know who has entered system, cant see local chat etc - the cloakers intel needs to come from sneaking around and looking for people)- maybe a minute delay on dropping out of local, so they appear for a minute when they enter a system. (gives the residents a clue that someone may be in system)- some form of delay on cyno popping, i understand this is one of the major concerns with afk cloakers.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
10/18/2013,"should a cloaked ship drop from local, the people who are active in the systems would not know of his/her presence.result, this would make it even easier to hot drop and apply force projection on any target in the system.this would increase the element of surprise. it would be a gankers dream come true.you would be able to operate in any system with impunity.should not the local in habitats have any tools to prevent protect or combat this?most of you who post on this thread would say no. we want free reign to hot drop or gank who we want whenever we want and we do not want them to know about it until it happens. if you do not believe this is a fair assessment than go back and re read what you have posted.the effect of this is before long you would not have anyone to gank as they ""prey"" would simply go play other games. no one wants to play a game where there is such an imbalance that you cannot do anything ""yes properly fitted ships and aligned out would not matter as you the ganker would just bring enough to counter"" you would effectively over hunt and no more fun for anyone.your job is too easy as it is. you sit in a system cloaked, check d scan every hour or so while you post pink ponies on facebook waiting for someone to be stupid. or you do it out of spite knowing the those who are there can do nothing while you are cloaked. so you log in in the morning on that account and leave it all day while you play on another account. please explain how the play of the above is balanced ? afk or not i want to hunt you if you cloak up in my system. if you are active the hunt will be more challenging but not impossible as it is now."
10/18/2013,"even though local is used as an intel tool, ccp states that it is not intended be so, kind of like the political speak, but we have to just deal with it. here is the issue i have when i read these threads it becomes two camps kind of mantra. the reality is in null, we all live under the same circumstances, and rules. we all have to deal with a cloaky possibly sitting on the cyno bridge, or where ever. all of us have to grind up isk to pay for ships or shiny bobbles. all of us have to deal with hot drops in lo-sec. you are not a special snowflake that only you and your little buddies dealing with this. we all do. and most of us have learned how to deal with it. and turn around and use the same tactics on the other guy. what most line members lose sight of, is that this tactic is not to signal out just you, you are not that special. (unless of course your space rage is so great, that posting your rage in local on their forums makes for a great thread.) it is used to starve the corp or alliance. it is used to cause havoc and internal strife with in the alliance / corp. and it apparently works very well. it is a viable method, tactic and apparently way above your pay-grade."
10/18/2013,"baaldor - yes i know how to deal with it, and no i am not a special snowflake and nor do i alone and my friends feel special. we all know how to deal with. the problem that you and others do not address is that in dealing with it results in lots of space remaining unused. this is something we should have tools to deal with, that is all we are asking for. a lot of the bigger entities in null, even ones hostile to each other have pacts agreeing not to cloaky camp each other. yes we all have the same set of rules. and the purpose of this forum assembly hall is to bring forth ideas and changes to those rules that will help the game improve.i am not space raging. to be honest i make most of my isk in jita and if i like could play without un docking to make isk for my other account to pvp with. that would be boring. point being i really like this game i think there are areas to improve, balancing the afk cloaker is one of those areas.if you like the status quo then you are entitled to your opinion. i welcome open discussion of pro's and con's for improvements of the game we all play."
10/18/2013,"well, i believe all afk people should be dropped from local, (regardless of what they are doing.)this idea of cloaked people leaving local is interesting but not quite what i would do, as it will cause even more panic. edit: as for why this is preferable, the ship wouldn't be removed from space. afk miners are still there, afk cloakers are still there. people just wouldn't necessarily know, but when someone is infact active in their vessel they will join local again. you can't assume where these people are, but at least you know they are playing and not fapping."
10/18/2013,"local is a chat channel.the unintended fact that it can be used for intel in many ways, does not remove this as the primary reason for it's existence.local providing intel that influences decision making in the game, dumbs down game play.we should be earning the intel, not having it handed to us.when we earn something, we can compete to out perform other players, and in turn get better results. by giving us perfect results for free, intel is dropped from competition except in the remaining areas not being defined by local.you expect these conditions in a tutorial, where you are learning the game, not to have such impact in areas widely considered end game by many.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
10/18/2013,"dude, it is just this simple. the afk cloaker is in your head. there is no fix from ccp. you, the dude behind the key board is allowing mr. spooky to get in your head. there is nothing in game they are doing to you to prevent you to do what ever you want to do. and especially if there are so much unused space...go use it, because the cloaker is not there. and if he follows you he is not as afk as you thought. and what bigger entities? if they have a pact then they are in a for a world of hurt. especially if they fly nrds."
10/18/2013,i :fap: :fap: :fap: when i play....
10/18/2013,"this. any afk cloaker has stories of well organized campaigns against him/her that worked. there are well known tactics to get intel on that person and to bait him. i would say that about 50% of the systems where afk cloaking is done counter with such tactics. the other 50% do not want to spend the effort. the point of the null sec is that it has risks that you cannot control. this is why the rewards in null sec are so much higher. eliminating or nerfing cloaking, even afk cloaking, will reduce the risk side of that equation dramatically, particularly for ratters."
10/18/2013,"if i remember correctly, the juke box was taken out because it was a code nightmare or some such.well, developers, i have a proposal. perfect time to design something that can read mp3 files from the harddrive, or play eve music like the juke box. can't be that bad!! we're talking ""look into folder, open files"" kinda stuff."
10/18/2013,"oh my god...what has happened to these forums..not one ""eve has sound...?"""
10/18/2013,im all for it. (as long as the feature costs about 500bill)
10/18/2013,"and why would anyone support an idea that obviously lends an advantage to bigger alliances? null is null, wh space is wh space. there's a difference for a reason."
10/18/2013,"this space would offer more advantage to small adventuring corps than big alliances. since there are npc stations, alliance wouldn't be able to lock down the region against people who choose to live and fight there. it's that simpleeven if big alliances were to receive greater benefit, there's no reason to not have this feature, since it only adds to the game. nobody loses anything, only gains"
10/18/2013,so syndicate with out local?
10/18/2013,"yes, something like that would be great"
10/18/2013,"k, go to syndicate and close local. v0v"
10/18/2013,you know it doesn't work that way. however i'd be happy if ccp removed local from syndicate if they don't want to make new region
10/18/2013,"you forgot to mention that in the world of eve, 96% of people are warfare pilots and 4% are industrialists. and since the needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few, the industrialists have no choice but to sit back and use the tools they were given so far."
10/18/2013,"all for innovation, but industry just got a major boost with the rebalance of rare ores, and the current ships out there do just fine. the idea of a new capital ship is interesting, but the role of capitals by far is to -support- a fleet. this applies to combat or industry types.and honestly, the mining barge changes from the last time around gave us more effective solo mining options, even the venture has been seen ninja mining here and there.i think ccp innovates industry just fine. the only thing people are really crying for (quite understandably in fact) is for changes to refining arrays at poses. which, i'm sure will be addressed when the pos update finally happens. (it's coming people, someday.)edit: and if anything, the next t3 will probably be battlecruiser or maybe frigate level. i can't see them ever making a t3 indy. talk about a waste of resources."
10/18/2013,lol what?you want bacon bot actually to be put into the game?
10/18/2013,"guristas are caldari and gallenteangels are matari and gallenteserpentis are gallente and matariblood raiders are amarr and matarisansha are amarr and caldaridoing the math we have:amarr: 2 primary; no secondarycaldari: 1 primary; 1 secondarygallente: 1 primary; 2 secondaryminmatar: 1 primary; 2 secondaryin other words; amarr / caldari are required for only three factions (one being sansha, so..) however, gallente and matari find their way into four out of five pirate factions. the latter is somewhat understandable, as serps are basically angels.but let's look at is this way..serpentis are 'rent-a-cops.' the lore states they are angels, but not. why not make them gallente/caldari? vindicator with missiles? ok.i guess what i am saying is the variance isn't there. maybe if moru was a bigger player, it would help. having a sixth faction to fly would allow either two primary and one secondary, or vise versa.one more thing, before i forget. the actual way the skill requirement / parents are setup should matter. a sansha ship that requires amarr cruiser and caldari cruiser should be different from a ship that requires caldari cruiser and amarr cruiser. for instance, the primary skill determines the ships offensive capabilities; the secondary its defensive. this means the first ship uses lasers or vamps and has a shield tank. the second ship uses either missiles or rails and has an armor tank.[u]i <3 logistics:[/u] pilot of all t2 logi and my shiny archon [deceased.] also a chimera which may or may not be horrid. i don't make games, i play them. i get that ppl are passionate about change. i post here to plant seeds. you see your idea as is? holy **** you win! so let's post, and see what the devs and our peers use."

10/19/2013,"i don't know what fantasy world you live in, but in the real world (and eve) you don't ignore intel because it wasn't ""earned"". you know someone is in local, you do not do anything in system. simple as that. or as was brought up above, you organize pvp and try to bait. but you don't ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist. edit: if your intention was to support or suggest something, you might want to make it clear. i'm not sure what you would prefer to have happen."
10/19/2013,"that's the problem. eve is not the real world.half the things that exist for gameplay reasons in eve would make no sense in the real world, because gameplay is the primary consideration.genuine cloaking and stealth is not fully unlocked.you can't hide from someone who automatically knows you are there, unless you are playing a childs version of hide and seek.i would suggest this idea:"
10/19/2013,"well put- this is another example of tools needed, if you read a few earlier post there were several suggestions for intelligence tools that required some effort. the most supported idea was to make local like many other chant channels where only those who spoke up would be visible. for intel and auto d-scan that ran every 10 to 30 seconds would show pilots in system but not show location or ship types, a more active scan would be needed. please expand on your ideas and give your thoughts on what intel tools would be best for the game., keep in mind we still want roamers to have a reasonable chance to find acquire and engage targets before they could escape, while at the same time giving the local guy a reasonable chance of escape should he be alert."
10/19/2013,"i think it's a great idea as a test for no-local.i am extremely confident that an eve 2.0 would not have local; it's just too ingrained from the early days that it can't be reversed across the board without a huge backlash. however, if there was an npc region and the gameplay was noticeably superior with no local, then a game-wide change would be much easier to push through."
10/19/2013,"actually, if you think about it, quite a few fly with local closed anyway in large fleets. cuz the local spam spews forth and you are pretty much lagged to ****, or td'd to ****, whatever we are calling it now."
10/19/2013,"there is are a number of individuals and organisations showing a severe and flagrant disregard for the tos. avoiding naming said parties, i'd prefer to address the bending and outright breaking of this rule...selling/referring sales of etcs with ""bonus isk credit"" breaks this rule.this is blatant and arrogant disregard for the rules, and an obvious, long running attempt to launder in game gains for out of game profits. some of these operations will even allow you to simply withdraw this supposed ""credit"" for it's isk value within minutes of receiving it, without using any of the services provided. no matter how you try to spin it, this is rmting for isk at it's most stealthiest.this has to stop.there can not be one set of rules for the average player, and another for people selling etcs. this is rmting/rmt laundering no matter how anyone cuts it. this ""etc with isk"" is no different to selling a ""paperclip with isk"" on ebay, other than ccp getting a few dollars for the sale of an etc.my main concern is this: this promotes botting, and makes the sale and purchase of botted isk simple and clean for the buyer once the botting cartels catch wind of this (if they haven't already). it's a slippery slope, and can only end in disaster, since once you remove the fear of asset strips/account bans for isk buyers, it will become a pandemic problem.i'm not calling for account bans. but a warning with a blanket pardon for everyone who has been breaking this rule seems fair, then strict enforcement from here on in."
10/19/2013,i approve this message
10/19/2013,"since the op is against botting, i wholeheartedly approve. this **** shouldn't even be an issue."
10/19/2013,"i've seen a lot of these lately. do a bunch of people have reason to believe they've found some kind of hole in the tos? the text itself seems pretty clear (on this point, at least, maybe not on a few others but that's neither here nor there) so i have to wonder if there's something ccp has done or said that might make people believe the tos does not really apply in this case."
10/19/2013,"i don't see how this contradicts the tos. if anything, it makes those wishing to violate the tos even harder.you're buying an in-game item with in-game currency. this item improves your in-game capabilities by allowing you to fly for another month.likewise, the people buying the plexes are purchasing an in-game item for out-of-game currency directly from the manufacturer, which doesn't violate the tos either. it's the same as buying the collector's edition and getting the golden pod, or for that matter it's the same as anything on the aurum market.the plexes make it much harder for rmters to do business, as ccp is very efficient at stopping those who rmt as well as those who buy from the rmters. it provides a way to use rl currency to help your character out without destroying the effort of those who have the isk to spend. rmters find it hard to compete with the player prices for currency exchange, especially with the thousands of bans that ccp have enacted.if you see some people botting (as you so adamantly claim), then report them and ccp will switfly bring down the banhammer on them. if you just don't like the fact that people can do this in the game, in complete compliance with ccp's business method, then wow is a quick download away."
10/19/2013,"no, the ""bonus isk!"" trend makes it far easier for rmters to operate.it's as simple as this:referrer a directs to an etc for $10 with no bonusreferrer b directs to an etc for $10 and offers an in game 100m isk bonus when buying through their referral link.buyers assuming this is legal will buy from retailer b every time.the latter is stealth rmting, or rmt laundering. promoting the purchase of etcs with items/isk that aren't part of a ccp bundle. people will always look for and take the ""best offer""."
10/19/2013,"i see what you mean now, but this will never be easy for the ones who offer this. first off, if the isk was gained through some illicit means, ccp will track it down. they keep records of every transaction in this game, and the paper trail will be obvious.it's always been advised to buy etcs from reliable sources. the people who buy them from the illicit dealers will have their 100m taken away, and maybe even the etc will be invalid. while it's good to keep ccp informed about the tactics of the rmters, i don't think this is something to sound a klaxon alarm about.i met and talked to dr. eyjog when i was in iceland during the csm summit. i have experience to say that ccp's crack macro/rmt team either has this under control or soon will."
10/19/2013,"this is right up there with ""everybody"" claiming people in ""region x"" rmt.if they really were, and on such grand scales as people like to think, that ccp would let that slide? please remember that ccp has a very good reason to prevent rmt, as that steps on their toes in regards to plex sales. good grief, just because you have ""issues"" with something doesn't make it wrong."
10/19/2013,"i'm strongly against this idea. the whole reason there are single-person corps is because ccp wanted to get people out of npc corps. this would counteract the effect, as most people would be better paying the 11% tax on only bounties and mission rewards rather than the relatively high cost of keeping the corp open. it would also serve to cause the market to enter a minor recession, as liquid funds would be eaten away quickly.missions already give a good payout, i highly doubt ccp would want to increase this margin. the economy is healthy....this would make the cost of running any corporation more of a headache than it already is.likewise, the cost for running an alliance is very high already....you're basically talking about doubling it (or more), since every corp in the alliance would have to pay the monthly cost, as well as every person in the corp.if you don't like the single-character corporations, wardec them. that is a huge reason why ccp encouraged people to leave the npc corps. i'm sorry, but i find this concept of yours impractical and poorly thought through."

10/20/2013,i petitioned this months ago. they said they'd investigate it. since then they have given them free rare ships... i wonder if i ever hear of the petition again.
10/20/2013,"that's quite a charge you're leveling against an organization that, although it's record is marred, it has provided a service for many capsuleers. with the amount they make from the lotteries, i highly doubt they'd need to macro for isk gain, at least as an organization as a whole.i don't like what ccp gave them either, as they obviously didn't need it, and the people who won those ships seem to be selling them on the market immediately. however, ccp is examining everything with dedication, and they definitely do not want a repeat of the t20 debacle.the isk is not being laundered, as you'd need to get it back for that to happen. they're simply offering a bonus to those who buy from the particular seller, since the gtc/plex price is the same for both sellers."

10/21/2013,"again, as i literally just explained to the last person who didn't read everything. i am not suggesting we just add a fee to corporations as the game is right now! i am only suggesting it as part of a larger, broader scale change. my main request is a re-vamp of the permissions segment of corporation management and a re-vamp of contracting!!!!!!!!!the rest is a suggestion that would need to be taken as a whole, not individual parts, for an expansion based on white collar occupations, because ccp tends to only change things in large quantities via expansions. i rarely ever see patches that fix one or two problems anymore. look at odyssey, they could have just fixed the scanning program. but they didn't, they decided to go overboard and revamp all of the exploration sites, rename all of the anomalies, change ice belts into anomalies and make all ore/ice anomalies visible without scanning . they also added a scanning overlay and redid the scanning skills. then they added a bunch of scanning modules and renamed a bunch of other stuff.my point is, ccp won't listen to a request for something easy to fix, they tend to only do complete overhauls of entire segments of the game. i am only requesting a re-vamp of permissions and contracting. the rest is a loose suggestion for an expansion if need be."

10/22/2013,"according to the eve lore, the pod remaining green is a station security feature. as the golden pod is so valuable, when it exits your ship, you are immediately transfered to a standard pod, while your golden pod is vaulted. this prevents scuffing of your golden pod due to wearing against the railings of the captains' quarters. more importantly, when wis in implemented 17.5 years from now, this substitution prevents thieves from breaking into your cq and hijacking your golden pod."

10/22/2013,"rmting doesn't need to have anything to do with macro-ing. they have a legitimate way to make lots of isk, like many others in eve. the problem is their sale of isk for $$ (rmting) which ccp seems to allow because it's coupled to the sale of a gtc. if this is allowed then i might just start my own gtc webshop with an isk promotion. would be even easier if ccp just said: give us x% and you can sell all the isk you want."
10/22/2013,"rules only apply to the lesser folk. like you. somerblink is eve royality. they have the connections with ccp which rightfully place them above you. nothing is stopping you from openning a lottery, partnering with an plex seller and engaging in rmt on your own. that's what the sandbox is all about, finding ways to cheat and then using your connections with people who run the game to get away with it."
10/22/2013,"if they're offering the item for the same price as the competition, how is that money laundering? they're giving people a bonus to shop with them, that's good business. if they were selling it at an inflated price and delivering isk in return, that would be rmt. if it can be shown that they were provided those etc by ccp through a gift or at a reduced cost, then this is another gifting issue which ccp is really looking into. if they sold the etc for greater amounts than the competition, then it's stealth-rmt. if they simply want to share some of their (insane) wealth, that's up to them.in either case, it's not money laundering if they're simply adding a bonus to the fair-price sale. i dislike their track record in dealings with ccp, but i'm not gonna wag a finger at somer for rmt if there simply is no evidence of it."

10/24/2013,"just think of the practical applications. and the possibility of another new ""career"" path. ""arms smuggling""i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
10/24/2013,"i don't do well with elaborate explanations so .. here goes..i think that roles should be defined by the manufacturer of the ship. tech one, tech two .. anything.tech one ships get a defining role by the corp that invented it. this is defined by that corp's ""mission statement."" so, for instance a domi bpo would be purchased by capsuleers from creocron. creodron focuses on drones, obviously, and this shows. so, if roden shipyards were to make a domi bpo, the mission statement of that corp would change the loadout and bonuses.this would provide a way to focus tiericide and, eventually allow for customization based off of the parent corp's influence.to take the previous example further, let's look at marauders. the kronos was invented by duvolle labs. but what would happen if creodron licensed the bpo? well, they would apply their influence to it, bonuses would change, and more importantly .. they would more than likely use their own hull. so now, we have a layer of complexity that adds .. interesting results. a kronos could be a mega .. or it could be a domi!but the kicker is that this ""influence"" ... it can be balanced vertically. in other words, the mission statement dictates how effective the ship is at specific functions. any change to the mission statement changes all the ships that corp has designed. the concept is both unifying and able to add depth to the game.remember: ""a rose by any other name ...""this can be applied to the current teiricide effort. one corp may prefer support, whilst another prefers attack. this would be in their mission statement. so the hulls line up that way.[u]i <3 logistics:[/u] pilot of all t2 logi and my shiny archon [deceased.] also a chimera which may or may not be horrid. i don't make games, i play them. i get that ppl are passionate about change. i post here to plant seeds. you see your idea as is? holy **** you win! so let's post, and see what the devs and our peers use."

10/25/2013,"i've only been running incursions for about two months. so i have little objective knowledge of ""how things used to be"". but from what little exposure i've had to inter-community politics and the infantile temper tantrums resulting from lost in-site contests, the current state of incursions appears to me to be #broken#.in recent weeks, one or two shield incursion communities have taken it upon themselves (for whatever reason) to ruin the gameplay for all incursion runners by killing the mothership as soon as it appears, lately within 12-16 hours of the incursion first spawning, rather than leaving it up for a few days so players can get a chance to run hq, assault and vanguard sites without having to travel 30+ jumps every day to get to the next spawn.at the risk of incurring the wrath of those who claim ""eve is a sandbox! wah, wah, wah!"" whenever somebody complains about a broken game mechanic, i'd like to make a suggestion to fix the problem:since the primary motivation of the above referenced shield communities for popping the mom appears to be to grief the entire incursions community as punishment for perceived offenses committed by one or more armor communities, i suggest changing the spawn mechanic to remove the detrimental effect to the entire incursions community. this can be done by re-spawning another incursion in the same location as the one just killed if the mom is popped less than seven days after appearing. over-farming of the mom site can be prevented by removing the reward for completing the site if it is run within a week of the mothership's appearance. it doesn't need to be a week, just a reasonable length of time to discourage childish temper tantrums which diminish the enjoyment of the game for the greater community.waiting expectantly for the rants of the griefers whose entire reason for playing is to think of ways to make as many people as possible angry. :3"
10/25/2013,"eve is real. this is the motto of the game, or one of them. like real life you can't reallocate your time once it is spent. i learned to ride a bike when i was 7 or so. i havent rode a bike in 3 or 4 years. i can't go back and reallocate my time to learn something i would find useful now like coding c++ or learning dreamweaver or other fancy computer tech.it sucks but the idea is to get players for the long haul anyways and in relatively short order those 2.5m skill points will be dwarfed. besides if you did something like this now players would swap entire roles over night or push their skills further with no time investment.besides, one day you might find those skill points useful. just how if i ever get off my ass and take my bike to the gas station to fill the tires with air i might ride it again."
10/25/2013,"currently you can train a secondary character in addition to your main for a plex a month. without said plex you still have access to that said character. i can see how from a logical perspective your argument holds weight.however, this would lead to a massive increase in gank alts and cyno alts. furthermore you would risk destabilizing the economy of eve by making plex an optional thing to buy (and interestingly enough arguments could be made either way on whether we would be facing super inflation or a general decrease in cost, regardless changes to the price of plex directly affect the changes in the price of everything in eve. if you don't believe me go take an economics class or two).on top of that you completely change the fan-base of eve to be mostly a bunch of snot nosed kids that otherwise couldn't have afforded eve and now get to run rampet shouting obscenities and ruining the role playing and political environments of eve. one thing that has always amazed me is that the people who play eve, interesting enough, on average tend to be older more mature players with jobs and responsibilities. just all around no. i could go on for days about how you would completely ruin everything that is eve. if you don't want to pay for eve, but still want to be in eve. go play dust. a free to play model would completely ruin everything."

10/25/2013,"any of you who are ceos of corporations, or able to alter permissions of individuals likely feel my pain. the interface needs to be completely re-vamped. it is old, bulky, and confusing. furthermore each and every permission tends to do nothing without the addition of other permissions, which means when making a title, before you know it the title has access to everything and you might as well have just check marked ""director"". main changes i am looking for are listed below. the bold ones are ones i feel need to be done asap. ""wallet access, divisional"" -- currently it gives the ability to withdraw and deposit isk from the account at will, but without added permissions from other categories you cannot spend money from the wallet on things for the corp. this is silly, and counter-productive and encourages people to withdraw from the account and intermingle funds. this should simply allow the player to set it as his active wallet and view current balance. no withdraws. no deposits. nothing. ""titles being a way to organize and filter permissions"" -- all permissions should be in reference to other permissions found in the title to which they belong. therefore a ""title"" that contains the ""trader"" permission and ""divisional wallet: wallet 1st"" would allow you to use ""wallet division 1"" for purchases. but a second title assigned to the same character that contained ""divisional wallet: wallet 2nd"" and ""contract manager"" would make it so he could buy and sell with wallet 1, but not wallet 2, which he could only pay for contracts with. ""jr. accountant"" -- currently this allows you to view bills for the corp, but not act on them, and only if you have wallet access, which as mentioned above allows you to withdraw freely. you cannot even see the journal for the wallet. that is ridiculous. this should allow you to see the bills and see the journal for any wallets the current title gives access to. ""accountant"" -- currently this allows you to view journal, pay bills, and buy and sell things for the corp (it has jr accountant and trader built in). this should be changed to allow you withdraw/deposit isk (see above change about removing that from default permissions of wallets) view journal, and pay any bills with the wallet. it should not allow you to buy and sell things with corp cash like it currently does. ""contract manager"" -- currently this allows you to spend corp cash on contracts, regardless of who they are assigned to. also currently when a contract is assigned to the corp anyone in the corp may accept it. that needs to be changed. the way this should work is when a contract is assigned to the corporation only people with this permission can accept it. ""personnel manager"" -- currently this allows you to view and accept applications. this should instead allow people to add titles to members, as well as accept new members. meanwhile the current ""personnel manager"" roles should be built into a permission called ""recruiter"" ""hanger access (based at/other/hq) permission sets"" -- currently if you set someone to have access to hangers at ""based"" location that location can not be a pos, and can not be hq. that is ridiculous on both accounts. we should allow ""based at"" permissions to combine with hq permissions, and we should be able to base people at a pos. ""other"" is currently the only way to give permissions at pos (and orca/rorqual) and it gives permissions everywhere that they are not based and that is not hq. honestly, ""based at"" should overlap with everything and be able to be put on a pos or hq, but i do feel ""other"" should not overlap with hq. this is so that hq can be considered a separate entity which is a common setup. i love the ability to create dynamic queries, we need to make sure they continue to work after changes. i will likely think of more things and post them here when i get around to it. point is i am sure i am not the only one upset by some of this crap. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________please be sure to thumbs up if you agree___________________________________________________________________________________________________"
10/25/2013,"the general look and feel of the whole thing needs a major overhaul as well. the interface needs to be streamlined and a bit more user friendly as well. some of the specific changes i am looking for as far as the actual interface itself goes are listed below, as before bold are what i feel most strongly about:change the check boxes under the various hanger permissions sets to radio style buttons. since ""take"" is just an advanced level of ""query"" it makes no sense that both should be able to be checked at the same time. this will not only eliminate some confusion, but will also allow users to at a glance see which set of right the user has. ""container take"" as its own category with the exact same setup as hanger take/query is just silly as well. remove these categories and simply add a radio button to the right of take that says ""all."" then when you are in the permissions sections for the various hanger permissions you can plainly see if the player can a) simply see things in a hanger b) take things other than containers or c) take everything including containers. or at the very least consolidate these check boxes to the hanger screens' area. add a mouse over tooltip for all of the permissions sets that says (straight from ccp) exactly what the various permissions are supposed to do. remove the excess unused titles and instead add a buttons at the bottom of the title section that say ""new title"" and ""remove title."" if there still needs to be a hard limit of 20, then fine, give an error message when the player goes to create title 21, but there is no reason to have all those extra titles cluttering things up. this also helps so that you do not run into problems when re-purposing titles as a new title would always be perfectly blank. change the roles section so that there is a space for duration. that is to say allow someone to receive a role for duration x with 0 of course being infinite. most of the time a permission added through the roles section rather than the title section will be for one of three things: 1) to make someone a director. 2) to temporarily add a feature for a character or 3) to give a character a slight modification from others with his title (such as the leader in his group or something of that nature). clean up the output from the auditing tab and allow people to see more than just the 10 or so entries it normally displays. any of you who have ever used--or more likely, ""tried"" to use--this feature will see that it is more or less unusable. allow the deletion of decorations no longer in service. i myself had an officer think it was funny to make a completely b.s. medal that has since been deleted and is no longer in use. however, every time i go to assign someone a medal, that garbage medal clutters the list. support for discontinuing a medal needs to be implemented. it is important we clean up the interface so that 1) people actually have the ability to make a corp with a legit hierarchy, and more controversially 2) so people don't make stupid permission assignment mistakes by accident due to the bulky beast that is the current ui. while this will make spies actually have to work a little bit, it means anything they earned they actually were meant to earn (which should make the victory sooo much sweeter). please be sure to thumbs up if you agree"

10/26/2013,"helloi have an issue regarding the price for faction weapons in the lp store. in brief the cost in tags for these weapons is too high. tag generation rates have suffered from a series of patches and game design changes but the lp store tag costs haven't been adjusted to compensate. what we see now is these weapons are disproportionately expensive to other weapons of the same type. this is not an issue of drop rates: players can physically build these modules and that needs to be accounted for.i request a rebalance of their cost to increase availability as the end goal. long version:the central issue of the current balance for faction weapons are their meta level. with some of these modules having a meta level of 9 in terms of ccps internal balancing metric this would require them to be very expensive and have a degree of power higher than the lower meta levela. where faction weapon stats specifically are considered they typically possess a few key bonuses. first of all they generate heat when overheated at around half the rate of t1 and t2 modules. secondly they have a bit higher ammo capacoty. in terms of caldari/fed navy turrets i observed slightly higher optimal on caldari faction rails while fed navy rails had more fall off. lastly navy weapons have less fitting requirements. in theory a dedicated fw player should be able to, through only his own efforts, obtain the tags for and build himself a full faction ship complete with faction weapons/support modules and ammo. it would be time consuming but the overall benefit for this player would be possession of a ship that is considerably tougher than the base t1 variant and have a full compliment of high grade weapons. his ship would have efficient tanking modules and better weapons for general purpose combat. this is a noble goal in itself - the player has built this ship through his own work.the issues start when you begin to account for how he will build it. there is only one way to get faction stuff - tags. tags are generated in three ways primarily those being mission running, fw missions or coercing faction police to fight. before the fw rebalance a couple of years ago it was possible to use the bountiful faction rats found in button complexes as a steady source of tags. with the other dominant alternative being l4 misssion running it was much easier just to use fw for collecting tags - a theory supported by the internal game mechanics of the lp store especially the fw lp store. the rebalance was enacted to reduce the npcs in a complex to bare minimum as a measure of enabling players to fight on more even terms. unfortunately this stripped one of the most popular methods of tag generation from the game entirely and the fall out from this has been faction weapons are a tiresome grind to build now. in terms of balance of the faction meta items themselves i do not intend any action here. i am solely concerned with making these modules easier to acquire. in a perfect world faction stuff ahould be more expensive than t2 gear where they are just outright better mainly in terms of like cal navy shield extenders or pds. things like passive shield hardeners or boost amps are outright better than t2 and cost a respectable amount alrrady. it's when looking at weapons that things start getting crazy. as of this writing cal navy ham launchers are 60 million each - a price not justifiable through any metric. they are so expensive only because to build them costs an upfront few million from the lp store and also something like 500 tags. five hundred. ccp should in my opinion reduce the lp store costs of these weapons and weapon bpcs in preference to creating a more accessible tag generator. why? because if a new source of tags is created but is created in the wrong way or place nothing will change. people are already not expending the effort to farm hundreds of tags and they won't do it in the future either. by reducing the lp store cost however you let the market drive demand ny virtue of much lower costs and an associated increase in supply as people's pre existing tags get more mileage. faction gear already out performs t2 stuff by a not inconsiderable margin depending on what you're looking for, lower prices will drive demand up. the increase in demand will see prices fall further over time and hopefully have the tertiary effect of making fw a more attractive and serious occupation in and of itself. with lp stores acting like a giant isk sink for the game getting people to buy more stuff from there will benefit the economy and help to drive inflation down. i won't specifcy any prices for a full faction fit but if conjecture put it at 2 -4 x the price of a t2 ship i think that could be very reasonable"

10/27/2013,"destruction of the mothership does not increase or reduce risk to the fleets while running incursion sites. it simply ends the incursion. those of us who want to participate in incursions and do not have the means of assembling a fleet capable of running the kundalini manifest site are cut off from running the lower tiered sites due to the almost immediate destruction of the mothership as soon as it appears. my complaint is not that fleets capable of killing the mom are killing the mom. that's the purpose of the site. i have no facts, just hearsay to back this up, but it appears certain shield communities are intentionally running back-to-back hq sites, not merely to reap the isk/lp rewards for those sites, but primarily to run the red out of the bar and causing the mom to spawn, then immediately kill it. again, not primarily to reap the isk/lp rewards, but to deny access to that incursion by all players as soon as possible. again, hearsay tells me that the reason they are doing this is in response to being butthurt over armor fleets occasionally contesting a site, and sometimes winning those contests. while i can understand the irritation of having to deal with a contest when you're trying to run sites, i don't think it adheres to the spirit of the game to pitch a hissy-fit and intentionally take a dump in everybody's oatmeal."

10/27/2013,i really don't see why you are posting here about this. the scorched earth policy being used is not the result of any ccp created mechanic but is the result of player actions and does not appear in any way to violate the eula. if anything (i admit from an outsiders point of view) its refreshing to see something besides isk farming happening in the incursion community.
10/27/2013,this.
10/27/2013,"some elaboration on how players might use such space would be good.nullsec has the following economic resources which as far as i can guess would work out distributed as follows in your new local-free region:high end money moons - pl or cfcmid range money moons - whoever can be bothered to stick a strong pos on and regularly clear off siphonsanoms, scan down combat sites - dedicated multiboxing site runners (like joker who gave a talk at eve vegas)gas - almost no one, an occasional explorerrelic/data - newbies in magnatesasteroid belts - no onenpc missions - cloaky nullified tengu alts if the lp payout is high because of unusual/unique items.pocos - probably no onehere's what i'm seeing resulting from this:- virtually no fights. you could hunt down tengus running sites or doing missions but it's a pretty horrible task which is why so few people do it on tq.now presumably this is not the op's vision so perhaps you could explain why you feel this space would be an entertaining addition to the game."
10/27/2013,hahahahaha... the thug lyfe meets internet games.there should be shows on this!
10/27/2013,"the words speak for themselves. i am a specialist in cyberbullying. here, bullying, at it's core, required forced nonconsensual involvement in an enviroment. schoolkids can be bullied, because they cannot remove themselves from school. workplace bullying exists because it's quite difficult for someone to up and change a job. cyberbullying exists only in that social media has become a huge part of today's life, and isn't something easy to escape from.ero 1's bonus rooms and singing are purely consensual. nobody forces you to play ero's game. you are not required to join the bonus round. nobody is holding a gun to a person's head, forcing them to sing. you can walk away at any time.you can start calling it ""bullying"", when ccp comes in and says ""sing on ventrillo or lose your account"". till then, it's someone making a poor decision.7.2 can i avoid pvp completely? no; there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided. --eve new player guide"
10/27/2013,and it's not done through any eve medium. it would be like ccp enforcing harassment rules on kugutsumen.
10/27/2013,"so you think just because we can quit eve online its not cyberbullying? ridiculous. ""bullying is the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse, intimidate, or aggressively to impose domination over others. the behavior is often repeated and habitual. one essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of social or physical power. behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal harassment or threat, physical assault or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets. justifications and rationalizations for such behavior sometimes include differences of class, race, religion, gender, sexuality, appearance, behavior, or ability.[2][3] if bullying is done by a group, it is called mobbing.[4] the target of bullying is sometimes referred to as a ""victim""""no where in this definition does it say ""hey your not a victim if you can walk away"". i am at work and my manager bullies me, but hey its not bullying because i can quit my job!!! no your still being bullied, you should not have to quit your job , quit a game, or do anything because of another person. you are bullies."
10/27/2013,"you are aware that alliance panels at fanfest have frequently contained clips of people being made to sing as ransoms for thier ship, right? and that these pannels have been pre-approved by ccp before they're put on?if they thought making people sing was bad, they wouldn't allow that. now, i have nothing to do with new order, other than finding them hilarious, but i think the only eula violation here is you literally wishing for the death of another human being over a stupid internet spaceship video game. you need help.edit: how do the cyberbulling laws in iceland work anyway?"
10/27/2013,"your correct in saying that currently its not against the eula, hence this proposal. if no one shows they dont approve of these actions ccp will never do anything about them. i have been messaged by a lot of people who tell me they support my posts about the issue but not one of them is willing to actually take the fight where it matters. simply put they are all afraid of you and the backlash you produce."
10/27/2013,"wow op, you have some serious issues.may i suggest you take a short break from gaming for a while and gain some perspective on life.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/27/2013,"let's take a look back over this thread. first, the definition of bullying you cite:so, by that rationale, comments like the following must surely count as bullying: your 'arguments' are full of inconsistencies, contradictions, self-aggrandisation, baseless histrionics and, worst of all, glaring hypocrisy.might i respectfully recommend you take a few days or weeks away from a game whose rules you openly cite as being unsatisfactory (this dissatisfaction being the remit of your thread), or even look for another pastime, one you find less distressing."
10/27/2013,i bet you haven't
10/27/2013,"sorry to spam, but i've subsribed to the minerbumping.com thread in question, and i now have even bigger concerns over the credibility of the complaint and its source. it's difficult to be confident that somebody is arguing from a balanced position when they post this kind of comment in an anti-bullying thread: i seriously suggest you take some time away from your pc and enjoy life, go for a walk, maybe even talk to somebody professional who is trained to talk over your feelings with you. it is a game, my friend. please don't let it consume your life."
10/27/2013,"reading is fundamental.[i]""the purpose of fighting is to win. there is no possible victory in defense. the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either. the final weapon is the brain. all else is supplemental[/i]."""
10/27/2013,"going to go ahead and confirm that before i became a member and backer of the new order, erotica 1 doubled my isk because i played the game correctly, i am fully literate, and i was polite. it was, in fact, her forthright, upfront and honest nature that persuaded me to see the new order side of things.oh, and cyberbullying doesn't exist(in general, and certainly not in eve), because the internet is an entirely voluntary participatory media. i will even cite eve precedent. you actually have to make an effort to move away from a bumper, as per the ""gm response on miner bumping"" before it can be considered griefing. in eve, the onus is on you."
10/27/2013,"please stop using the ""its just a game"" bit. this has nothing even to do with eve, this is about the cyber bullying , eve is simply the medium being used to do said cyberbullying. i am asking the medium (ccp) to not allow itself to used as a focus for bullying.even if i walked away from eve i would still feel the same way about erotica 1, not because shes a troll in a game, but because she hurts people on purpose."
10/27/2013,the fatal flaw in your logic is that eve is indeed a game.
10/27/2013,"logic [snort] this is about the feels man.[i]""the purpose of fighting is to win. there is no possible victory in defense. the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either. the final weapon is the brain. all else is supplemental[/i]."""
10/27/2013,"indeed. i must admit - this is almost like saying that, instead of free will, we have 'free won't'. logic is for the 20th century dude - let mumbo jumbo rule now the age of aquarius is upon us...perhaps we can get back to the good old days of a physician curing people by bloodletting and shaking his fist at the moon.one thing: this pallarva is great free publicity for your new order. s/he is almost like a marketing agent for you lot!"

10/28/2013,"i think it would be useful to have bumping ""physics"" work. in a recent bumping incident i noticed my freighter (980x10**6 kg) was moving about he same as the machariel that was attempted to hold me up. at 10x less mass than me he should have been unable to have as much impact as he did. and his rebound (assuming perfect elasticity) should have been 10x as great.another thought but impractical would be to transfer damage to both parties in proportion to mass."
10/28/2013,"fyi, if you are being bumped.... use the log off safely mechanism to despawn your ship without alerting the bumpers to your impending disappearance."
10/28/2013,"imo faction weapons generally are overpriced by about an order of magnitude. given that they don't in practice outperform t2 (due to the effect of weapon specialisation skills) and can't use t2 ammo, they should have a target price of around double the equivalent t2 gear, triple at most. that would actually make them a viable alternative to t2 rather than just vanity ornaments.edit: and such a change would also allow them to serve as a useful alternative if we see runaway t2 materiel prices."
10/28/2013,op updated with more info
10/28/2013,ccp has done a lot of dough headed dumb ass things recently. removing the juke box is one of them. fix this and bring it back in the next update.
10/28/2013,"i've been following this and the jukebox petition thread for a while now, and i don't know if all of the ""eve has sound?"" posts are in the same thread, but they're int here somewhere and there's several of them. the jukebox petition thread (linked in post #124 above) is up to 28 pages now."
10/28/2013,"this feature has been suggested before, but i would like to repeat it as it would be very useful.members of the logistical backbone of corporations and alliances often provide ready-to-go, fitted ships for their members. currently fitting those ships requires individual actions for each and every ship. both renaming and fitting the ships has to be done for every ship separately. given that the amount of ships handled often numbers in the hundreds, this is a very time consuming job, one that could easily be automated.it should be possible to rename a selection of ships of a certain type and fit them with a saved fit, all with a handful of clicks."
10/28/2013,still supported.
10/28/2013,nailed it.
10/28/2013,"you know what it sounds like to me, from your description here?it sounds like you engaged in some pvp - perhaps indirectly, but pvp nevertheless - with the shield fleets by contesting a site they were going for, thus harming their wallets. now they're striking back - namely, by shutting off your farming ability as quickly as possible - and you're whining that they're being unfair.basically, it sounds like you're no better than a typical schoolyard bully. you pick on the other kid until he lashes back, then you run to the teacher. only difference is that this is eve, not the schoolyard, so there's no bull**** zero tolerance policies that get the other kid expelled for protecting himself."
10/28/2013,"i would recommend that if you do not like the fact that someone is intentionally shutting off the incursion early, that you mount your finest battlesteeds and engage them in hounourable player vs. player combat.if you're unwilling to do this to protect your money making schemes, i'm afraid eve is gonna be a pretty unfriendly place for you, especially in the next 6-36 months."
10/28/2013,we may need a number smaller than 0 here.get some of our top men on this.
10/28/2013,"in hindsight, this was probably the wrong place to post in an effort to instigate an uproar at the behavior of certain incursion communities. apologies for that. in response to the commentor who thinks denying access to the incursions gameplay to the entire eve community because they got their panties in a twist about being contested by a fleet from another community in a site ... i'm glad you didn't have access to nuclear weapons when somebody picked on you in your childhood."
10/28/2013,which one?
10/28/2013,which one what?
10/28/2013,"yes, a forum where people recognize and point out that you're suffering consequences for your own actions was probably the wrong place to expect sympathy from."

10/28/2013,it's an extra service he provides for free.
10/28/2013,you've been a pretty good teacher when it comes to honing my technique though.
10/28/2013,it's a service i provide for free.
10/28/2013,"i agree with your assessment.to encourage non-alliance based pvp, small scale pvp, such region would need to have extra incentives, such as:1) special asteroids that are more profitable than asteroids found in other regions. these have to be either in the main asteroid belts or anomaly sites that are automatically detected without need for scanning equipment.2) much more profitable belt rats, at least 2x average bounty and greater chance for faction spawns.idealy, the npc region should be setup in such a way as to prohibit alliances from setting up jump bridges. this should result in greater than usual stargate traffic and greater chance of encounters in easily accessible areas, such as gates, asteroid belts, anomalies.i remember before ccp added all the pos stuff and jump brides, and nerfed officer hunting, 0.0 space was much more lively for small scale fights. now it feels almost deserted. my idea should encourage small scale engagements and make things much more lively, at least in a small part of the map"
10/28/2013,"if only for this reason, it's a valuable idea.adding more variety in eve's ""ecosystems"" can only make it better."
10/28/2013,"funny, first time i've heard any of this."
10/28/2013,this is a longstanding eve tradition (see also: ransom for song)
10/28/2013,"if you don't like the idea of having your singing recorded, then you can exercise a minimum of self respect and tell the new order to go to hell and blow up your retriever."
10/28/2013,"i appreciate the two of you replying to this thread.your job as csm's is to represent all of us player base, not just the oldfarts. i ask that you keep an open mind to the needs of every player, and consider that just because something has always been, doesn't make it right."
10/28/2013,"man, if i had a nickle for every time someone told me what my job as csm was, i'd be as wealthy irl as i am ingame."
10/28/2013,"here's my question for you...what do you expect the csm to do, actually? they're just players of eve, same as you, me, and everyone else. they don't have speshul gm powers. they don't have any powers, aside from talking to ccp in a slightly more direct way than the rest of us.lets say, somehow, you get the csm behind you. next summit meeting, they all stand up at ccp hq and say ""hey, this singing for ransom thing is bad, make it stop!"" ccp says ""lol, no"".you asked via petition, the gm's said you were wrong. they sent you to the forums for lulz. you're kinda a laughing stock of regular forum denizens. we egg you on over in the mb.com forums for more lolz. are you grasping the pattern yet?(forgive me csm's, if i've made you out to sound useless. you guys get stuff done...just, you don't do it the way op thinks.)7.2 can i avoid pvp completely? no; there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided. --eve new player guide"
10/28/2013,"*gives you a nickle* your an elected official no? elected to represent the playerbase and take the communitys collective complaints to ccp. i realize im just one voice atm, but i ask that if more voices join mine you will seriously consider giving it recognition."
10/28/2013,"i dont mind being a laughing stock to fight for what i believe is right areola. the whole eve community could be against me on this subject, doesn't mean i should change my view and feelings about it. i believe one thing, you believe another, all i can do is put my point of view out there and hope that there are others who feel as i do, that eve doesn't have to be played this way to be trolltastic and fun.*edit* im sorry but per eula im not allowed to speak about what the ccp representative told me exactly."
10/28/2013,"what you are doing is the equivalent of walking into a peta meeting with the intent to explain how wrong they are being vegetarians. eve was very explicitly designed to be ""trollastic and fun"". see my sig for a quote. another quote comes from ccp describing the collectors edition..""we found early on that, when friends played eve together, they stopped being friends! we thought ""that's awesome, we need to keep developing this"" (loose quote, btw)7.2 can i avoid pvp completely? no; there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided. --eve new player guide"
10/28/2013,"that's a good job.at least you're starting to listen and learn.as per the replies in this thread, you hope in vain. and there are many other things you can do, like wardeccing krypteia operations, or even unsubcsribing and playing something else, like club penguin. or you could divert all that time, energy and indignation you're misdirecting into a make believe world and instead fight for something important, like world peace, equal rights for all and an end to pollution.and boxing doesn't have to involve knockouts, football doesn't have to involve goals and ice hockey doesn't have to involve fights. see your earlier comment about the whole eve community.send them a petition. perhaps it will be the first time they've heard any of this.i have to ask: are you really a new order agent on a windup? is this whole incident, including this thread, another new order/goonswarm prank?"
10/28/2013,"i'm going to read this thread. but first let me quote our dear op from the minerbumping forum.""but now i can only truly say i wish that erotica1 would die in front of his pc releasing his bowels on his chair, and being discovered alone with 50 cats eating his corpse.""if anyone needs to be looked at it is you dear op. seriously wishing a real life death upon me like this. you are ******* sick."
10/28/2013,you guys sure do like to quote only parts of my conversations :3 at least i gave the common courtesy of letting your links speak for themselves.
10/28/2013,"going to go ahead and confirm that erotica 1 doubled my isk because i played the game correctly. i too am fully literate, and i was polite, as are all other successful bonus room winners. op's claims are nothing but hogwash. erotica 1 is perhaps the most honest and responsible individual i have ever had the privilege of gaming with. as for op wishing harm upon erotica 1? well, i think we can see the quality of her critics now, can't we?what a shame it is that players such as op continue to attempt to ruin the game for pillars of the community such as erotica 1. it is hypocritical to denounce 'cyberbullying' whilst engaging in a campaign of hate against erotica 1. literally impersonating myself"
10/28/2013,"the amount of ""im a new order alt"" in this is scary. if your going to pretend to be someone else , you need to lose that ""repeat things 10 times in a cultish way"" thing you guys do."
10/28/2013,"so you believe that i am somebody other than myself pretending to be me?who do you believe i am?if you need somebody to talk to, your local health region very likely has crisis lines available where somebody can talk through your issues with you. i wish you all the best. literally impersonating myself"
10/28/2013,"read above. your quotes are all intact. i encourage everyone reading this thread to thoroughly examine the links you and i provided. i am glad to see you got kicked from your corp by the way. gentlemen's agreement has recovered their reputation. i don't know what the hell they were thinking letting you in. i can only assume something at eve vegas was related until they read your forum posting. my god, you are worse than any widot monkey on a typewriter than i have ever seen, and that's saying something.i really hope you get some help. by the way, no matter how disgusting and hateful your public wish that i die a horrible death in real life, i have not petitioned it. hell, there's no reason to, you're embarrassing yourself enough without any prodding from me.i tell you what though. if you want to put this behind us, i'll offer you a bonus round. i don't just do this for everyone- generally only one in every 100 clients. but you are special. i am happy to pay you out if you show me complete faith and stop all this ridiculous nonsense. warm regards,-ero"
10/28/2013,oh god i laughed so hard at the bonus round thing... your so magnanimous in trying to screw me over :3.
10/28/2013,"1) true as far as it goes, but we're also here to represent the players of the new order too.2) we're not in any way, morally or legally, required to ""represent by poll"". in short if 10 players want me to support x and 10,000 players want me to oppose it, i am still duty and conscience-bound to support to ccp it if in my considered opinion, x is the right thing to do. that said, i would also be duty bound to tell ccp ""although i strongly believe x is right, there will be significant community backlash if it is enacted"".3) i specifically campaigned on a specific platform of viewpoints about the game, and i regret to say that my campaign platform would not be compatible with restricting player freedom in the way that you want. it would be seen as a betrayal of the promises i made by the people who voted for me if i were to do so.4) i envy your privileged upbringing if you think singing a song to save an internet spaceship is ""bullying"". i could tell you a few things that i personally have been through that actually are bullying, and let me tell you, singing a song in a damb video game isn't on the list."
10/28/2013,"are you are the person that, on an eve fansite (www.minerbumping.com) recently stated the following?""but now i can only truly say i wish that erotica1 would die in front of his pc releasing his bowels on his chair, and being discovered alone with 50 cats eating his corpse. ""that is worse than most things i've heard miners say, and i've seen all the usuals (rl racist slurs, rl anti-semitic slurs, accusations of raping children, etc)."
10/28/2013,"i appreciate your well thought out and serious response. may i ask how the csm works in regards to choosing what to bring to ccp's attention? is it a group decision , or if i can get at least one of the members to sponsor it will that be enough?"
10/28/2013,can you get at least one other eve player to agree with you? let's try that first.
10/28/2013,"you can bring things to ccp's attention. you have done so. the community team at least read the forum. csm backing for an idea tends to lend weight and increases the chance of getting that attention. you might try mike or ali, but i warn you that there's no garauntee that they'll be sympathetic."
10/28/2013,"ooreikaoo michiko i am seriously considering running for csm in the future. if i can have your vote, your support, and your forum activism, i think i can secure the spot. i promise then i will bring your matter to the attention of the relevant parties."
10/28/2013,"i think reika should run for the next csm. if all of her claimed supporters voted for her, she'd most likely get in!"
10/28/2013,so how are the seating arrangements determined? could we sit next to each other?
10/28/2013,"im serious, i will vote you in, not even joking.why? because if mittani was an example, you wouldn't be able to do the same crap you do as a csm. you win, i win, go ahead erotica, run."
10/28/2013,why did you claim it creates no content then link to tons of created contentthat seems counterproductive
10/28/2013,"i would hate to think a boring, non-content creating carebear was trying to get interesting content creators banned out of jealousyplease link to an equal or greater amount of content created by you to avoid that impressionthis thread doesn't count as it is more properly considered content created by erotica 1"
10/28/2013,"wit that logic , new order isn't content since it is just a reaction to afk miners content"
10/28/2013,"i'm afraid you're digging yourself deeper and deeper into a non-content creation hole here and demonstrating that this thread is nothing but a depraved attempt to tear down content creators due to your intense jealousywe must ask ourselves: who is the strong, vigorious content creator from whom content flows like a fountainhead and whose contribution is irreplaceable and who is merely a replaceable drone who contributes nothing that a random replacement would notthe new order are the strong, vigorious content creators while the various illegal miners contribute nothing but their presence as disorderly criminals, and their long drawn out wail as they are brought to justice. this thread too is merely the reaction of a faceless drone to erotica 1's fountainhead of content creation. it is the review of a seminal masterpiece by a drunken layabout who did not appreciate that the art's illuminating vision exposed the failures of his wretched life: entertaining in its own way, but purely derivative of the masterpiece and a consequence of its genius"
10/28/2013,"faceless drone? practically everyone knows who i am at this point, who are you again?would you please get on topic already."
10/28/2013,"he's cfo of the cfc.kind of a big deal.conversely, basically no one but the relatively tiny number of players who read this thread - and, i suppose, the readers of mb.com - know who you are.he also is on topic. i mean, he's ridiculing you for your topic, but that is being on topic. one does not have to sympathize with a viewpoint to be ""on topic"" while discussing it."
10/28/2013,"pretty sure to be on topic he has to discuss points about the topic not about the op.*edit* and seriously the cfo of cfc, dont you think the cfc has had its faced shamed in bullying enough already with the ouster of the mittani from the csm, you feel you need to support another debacle?*edit 2* secondly , should you be really showing so much respect on a public forum meant to give any player the ability to bring up grievances. if he has more power then me in this, the csm might as well just be a cfc diplomat, not a community diplomat."
10/28/2013,shadow ironic rand dunk.******* classy.
10/28/2013,"ok, you know what? i am totally going there. if mittens had said ""biomass"" instead of ""kill"", he'd have been 100% in the clear."
10/28/2013,"by demonstrating that your grievances are meritless and not worth considering, the csm has done the admirable job of assisting the community in relaying legitimate grievances to ccp and increasing the signal/noise ratio of grievances in this forum to improve the ability of players with legitimate grievances to be heard. they should be commended."
10/28/2013,so nice to be appreciated.
10/28/2013,"aren't you the one who posted""but now i can only truly say i wish that erotica1 would die in front of his pc releasing his bowels on his chair, and being discovered alone with 50 cats eating his corpse. ""you also have a scantily clad underaged girl as your profile picture on the mb forums.you aren't exactly a model internet denizen."
10/28/2013,"i'm guessing he's the guy who fired you from the cfc. i guarantee that other than the tiny portion of eve players who read these forums, no one knows who you are."
10/28/2013,"you have already decided my grievance is meritless in the one day the post has been up? my apologies your majesty.*edit* answering on behalf of the csm, ballsy"
10/28/2013,"we should all applaud what erotica 1 does, such an amazingly nice thing to do for the players of eve.that's all i'm saying."
10/28/2013,"i have no wish to be anything of the sort, i dont care at all about your politics or your players who think they are god's because they've played a game for a decade... i care about humans and people who justify emotionally damaging people by hiding their acts in a virtual world"
10/28/2013,"the problem with using the ""emotionally damaging"" argument in a game is that anyone can make it against any part of the game they dislike.be very careful about the arguments you make around people who ascribe to the ""moral relativism"" school of thought."
10/28/2013,"i agree. let's say i find the molestation of defenseless asteroids to be highly emotionally damaging. by the op's logic, that activity must be ceased at all costs by ccp because hurt feelings are the first and only measure we should use for anything. ergo, remove the lascivious ""strip"" mining modules from the game, and ban all miners."
10/28/2013,"it is actually a lack of existing content that has set the new order in motion. nature abhors a vacuum, and miners have left new eden in a deprived and wanting state. our response to the the vacuum includes the creation of content. we make every effort to fill it, as we insist that progress can be made, and balance restored to the universe. if miners would busy themselves creating content in the ways that are currently unknown to them, then the new order would be less inclined to fill that vacuum with content. as it stands, it can't be that we are 'reacting', because that would imply that afk miners are 'acting', which we know is untrue. thus, because we can see that the new order is in fact creating content where there was none before, it can't be the case that the new order is a reactionary force in new eden. the miners are, in fact, the reactive force. all content created by the miners in question springs from their reaction to the new order's creation of new and original content. the laws of nature are at work here. every action has an equal or opposite reaction. in this case, the 'bumpee' is necessarily acting in a strictly reactive sense as a result of the motion imparted upon him or her by the 'bumper'. we can easily see who is the reactionary force here. literally impersonating myself"

10/29/2013,hey op why don't you go join a nullsec group and mine out there? null has stronger police than highsec would you believe it... being set to red is like a death sentence
10/29/2013,"thoot him, offither! thoot him at onthe! he puthed me!"
10/29/2013,"if you criminalize bumping someone, i swear i shall sit on the jita undock with an alt in a charon and rack up killmails. the problem with criminalizing an otherwise innocuous act, nevermind that it's petty and childish, is that because a considerable portion of the time the act is commited, it's accidental without harm intended.you could, instead, just not be afk. i mean, i suppose it's technically easier to complain on the forums than push the ""orbit"" button, but even so, i'd go ahead and put in the extra effort while mining, were i you. as for escorts, l2 escort and double web."
10/29/2013,"an important thing to remember....anything you get, i also get. keep that in mind, when advocating for these changes.it'd sure make ganking cheaper for one. two noob ships. noob ship a bumps the miner into noob ship b. concord responds. blaps ship a for bumping the miner, then blaps the miner for bumping ship b.us gankers have come up with an awesome solution to bumping. give miners a siege module, that locks them in place. locked to one spot for a 15 minute cycle time. can't move, or be moved an inch. i'm positive there's no way that could be used for nefarious purposes, and it's exactly what miners want.that was sarcasm, if you didn't catch it.7.2 can i avoid pvp completely? no; there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided. --eve new player guide"
10/29/2013,"just as well that it's sarcasm, because siege mode doesn't work that way anyway. you can very definitely still be moved."
10/29/2013,"this really is a good idea, because faction weapons should be a usable alternative to t2. they're not op, i can't see how this would break anything, and it has several beneficial consequences.before i try and escalate this, is there anything problematic that anyone can see with this? i've tried and i can't."
10/29/2013,"i would love to be able and use my lp to buy ships and modules directly ( at inflated lp costs of course)that should encourage people to upgrade i-hubs more.my other thoughts on tags:exchange tags for lp directly at a fixed rate based on the tag level ( or variable so ccp can adjust it as needed )- all items would be lp only other than items that need other things like nexus chips, data cores, ammo etc-or-have 2 different prices on the same item, one with tags, one without.- with tags would be a better lp / tag ratio than the strait lp cost- the tag market and gathering may pick up in response to better lp / tag ratios- more people in faction warfare to gain access to the faction equipment"
10/29/2013,not that my opinion counts for much because ~npc corp~ but i can't really think of anything bad about this. right now eve-central puts the average price of fn 250mm rail guns at something like 116m each. one rack of those would pay for a small fleet of fully t2 fit battlecruisers. to me that's broken.
10/29/2013,"see below, my browser screwed up and pseudo double posted...."
10/29/2013,"the simple seems short sweet simple and sublime. it is really kinda an obvious fix though when ya think about it. as far as the advanced fix, it would make having a higher sec status actually do something.<<---"
10/29/2013,"i guess he's finally admitting that the current is a good thing. v0vhopefully, he still gives me my bounty.""eve is a dark and harsh world, you're supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in, you're not supposed to feel like you're logging in to a happy, happy, fluffy, fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures, that's what hello kitty online is for."" -ccp wrangler"
10/29/2013,scantily clad? its a tank top and a pair of shorts... for the internet i feel im doing pretty modest. thanks for the personal attack though.
10/29/2013,"i too am going to go ahead and confirm that erotica 1 doubled my isk because i played the game correctly. i too am fully literate, and i was polite, as are all other successful bonus room winners. they really are.op's claims are nothing but bullcrap. erotica 1 is perhaps the most trustworthy and responsible individual i have ever had the privilege of never gaming with. as for op wishing harm upon erotica 1? well, i think we can see the quality of her critics now, can't we? what a shame it is that players such as op continue to attempt to ruin the game for pillars of the community such as erotica 1. it is hypocritical to denounce 'cyberbullying' whilst engaging in a campaign of hate against erotica 1. it was also shameful.oh and this post was all my own work.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/29/2013,"""i too am fully literate, and i was polite, as are all other successful bonus room winners. ""jokes old, your an alt, we get it, get back on topic."
10/29/2013,"your whole hate campaign against me, where you link content you disapprove of all over the internet, is a bit like someone who hates pornography linking sex videos everywhere she can to ""expose"" it. i suspect that 75% of those liking your posts are, in fact, showing appreciation for you conveniently linking the hydra series in chronological order.also, please update your photograph on the minerbumping website. since you support me for csm, i suggest you hold a sign that says ""erotica 1 for csm."" please only do this if you are of legal age.thank you."
10/29/2013,"yes, anybody who doesn't share your hatred-fueled fringe minority position is an erotica 1 alt. sure. i guess anybody who happens to be literate, polite, or a winner is an alt of erotica 1 too, then. is that right? literally impersonating myself"
10/29/2013,hearing erotica 1's voice over comms is a religious experience. its sad there are people here clearly jealous of erotica 1's fame and fortune. erotica 1 for csm. because he truly cares.
10/29/2013,you mean besides the fact you used the exact same sentences?
10/29/2013,"i yield. your mighty logic is irrefutable. no person could possibly plagiarise another like minded person's comments on an internet forum to make a point. that would be impossible. it is much more likely that everybody is erotica 1.have you checked under your bed, in your closet, etc. for erotica 1? she seems to be everywhere! literally impersonating myself"
10/29/2013,"your right, the fact you both were part of deep core mining, a corp with tons of new order members in it, should be disregarded as well."
10/29/2013,"they're trolling you. very effectively i might add.and the reason for this is that you don't have any real argument besides ""i don't like this and think it is wrong!"" ... which is a terrible argument to make because (as i mentioned before) it can be applied to any activity and/or action in this game by anyone.as far as bullying goes... sorry... but grow some thicker skin. everyone has been bullied at some point in the past. i was bullied, my friends were bullied, my bullies were bullied... hell... my family and my friends' families routinely bully everyone and anyone in it (ex. ""why can't you be like your brother/cousin/friend and get married already? i want grandkids!! son, i love you but... are you gay? why won't you date anyone? etc. etc."").you could say it's a part of the human condition... or at least so deeply ingrained within the norms of society that it will never be completely removed (such as the perception that you should be settling down and having kids when you are in your mid 20s)."
10/29/2013,"well this is a step in the right direction, at least you can admit its bullying now."
10/29/2013,"you do know deep core mining is an npc corp, right?7.2 can i avoid pvp completely? no; there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided. --eve new player guide"
10/29/2013,"actually no, ive always been an fna o7 member."
10/29/2013,"actually, you're a member of the scope now. lots of new order bumpers are in the scope. i'm afraid nothing you say against the new order can be relevant now.on that...you're proposing grandiose changes to a game you don't even understand the basics of, like npc corps. c'mon, you gots to be trollan'.7.2 can i avoid pvp completely? no; there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided. --eve new player guide"
10/29/2013,*gasp*
10/29/2013,not in the sense that it is an issue worth creating a fuss about... much less action against. as far as i'm concerned... it's normal.
10/29/2013,"you have to admit, the logic is irrefutable. together with the fact i was in deep core mining. let's not forget that! that fact alone speaks volumes.i also think he's solved the obvious anagram from the name deep core mining. we love our drink, so the rest is pure logic as well.deep core mining = pre code gin mine. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/29/2013,"oh god, enough this has totally worn me down, you win........not, seriously im not going to get off this subject just because your trolls, i play eve online for fun?"
10/29/2013,you should just stick to treadmills and laptops till you get better at it. then you can try attention w****** on the forums. good luck.sugar von murderertits : jake warbird gets my vote for most intriguing and attractive male character in eve.
10/29/2013,"ah! the conspiracy finally surfaces!although not into suicide ganking miners in hisec, i have to take my hat off to what you lot are doing. it's by far the most sophisticated, well-organised and thought out role play i have ever seen. creating this kind of emergent gamplay enriches eve for everyone.ps i must be an alt of erotica 1 - now send me 500 million isk.eta: this was, of course, a joke/troll/act of immaturity, and in no way meant to lead anybody to believe i am using the character name of another player to impersonate or falsely represent his or her identity.still, i'm happy to take the 500,000,000 isk anyway."
10/29/2013,"i don't know about everyone, but i've heard of you as the one who saidon the minerbumping.com forums."
10/29/2013,"it takes a strong woman to admit when she is wrong. thank you! can you please still link that photograph showing you holding a sign that reads ""erotica 1 for csm!"" please? you could be one of my campaign consultants, and we can start right now."
10/29/2013,this thread is why i play eve.
10/29/2013,"i'm at a loss for words: first off, falling for these scams is just silly. i just don't understand how it happens non-consensually. next, ransoming for a song has been done many, many times in the past, and i don't see it as some terrible shameful activity. it's just another form of exchange, where someone willingly entertains others to get ahead in the game. next, your trying to invoke cyber-bulling to get ""attention"", but you are way out of line. in a game of chess, it is not bullying to take your enemies pawn. in a game of eve, it is not bullying trying claim a system and control activities in it. bullying is much more personal, it is much more aggressive, and it is much more harmful. if these folks were following you from system to system, insulting you, preventing you from playing eve, posting nude images of your likeness, whatever... that would be bullying. what the mittani did, while talking to hundreds on stage, and thousands on a live stream, was identify a player with emotional problems, tell everyone to harass them, and recommend that he kills himself. that is crossing the line. bumping players about to prevent them from utilizing a system they are claiming is fair game play. asking someone to sing embarrassing songs in ransom is not. recording the vocal ventings of a player losing their head on the game is not."
10/29/2013,"i personally don't use cq... but, i paid 150 bucks for a golden damn pod. i want my golden damn pod! whether it's in cq or in station...i paid for it...now give it to me."
10/29/2013,
10/30/2013,"true enough, yup. i suppose i was using ""siege mode"" in a generic way.still, please, please give miners they're much requested space anchor. i'd have zero problems with a miner stuck in one spot for 15 minutes.7.2 can i avoid pvp completely? no; there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided. --eve new player guide"
10/30/2013,faction weapon imbalance is another issue that would ideally be rolled into a 'metacide' initiative for module balancing along the same lines as the tiericide of ship hulls we have already seen. fozzie has indicated previously that such a balancing project might be on the cards eventually but if those plans can be made reality then the sooner the better.
10/30/2013,/signed.oh how i would love to fit 100 tech 2 gank catalysts at once.

[u]i <3 logistics:[/u] pilot of all t2 logi and my shiny archon [deceased.] also a chimera which may or may not be horrid. i don't make games, i play them. i get that ppl are passionate about change. i post here to plant seeds. you see your idea as is? holy **** you win! so let's post, and see what the devs and our peers use."
10/30/2013,"i don't understand people attacking the sansha ships in incursions.the capsuleer ships drop more and better loot, and have worse ai.sure you need to get into their corporation first, or wardec them and hope they ignore you, but that is a small price to pay."
10/30/2013,"now i'm not an incursion runner, so i don't have much experience with them, but isn't the point of an incursion to defeat the mothership????[/sarcasm]jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
10/30/2013,"i'm kind of confused....all this incursion running groups and complaining about motherships and stuff just reminds me of old everquest mob camps.i mean, we're playing eve. if the ""other team"" is doing something so profoundly annoying....go shoot them! get some awoxing going, corptheftery, suicide gank...hell, suicide ecm at the right time on logi. the last thing you should be doing is crying like a themeparker experiencing ""unfairness"".if they pop the mothership too quickly for you, then go pop them before they can kill the mothership.7.2 can i avoid pvp completely? no; there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided. --eve new player guide"
10/30/2013,"i have criticised them for it, but in truth, i can't really fault them in this thread, because mynna's first and second post was not really that unpleasent. though it could be that i actually agree with them, so the biting wit has less of an impact. seriously, i think the frustration you have is that you can see no way to get back at the people doing this, as they are spread out in diffeent corps and npc's corps you cannot war dec them, nor can you suicide gank them because that takes a certain amount of organising of like minded people and they don't really exist in your community, but you could impact some of them and chose not to, why not at least target some of what you feel are their leaders, speak to fellow pilots upset with it and get something going.. their objective could be to reduce the number of people running incursions and it is effective, or it could be that certain people want incursion runners in bling fitted ships warping gate to gate, so yes it is pvp and if you wantg to gather that isk you will have to harden up and resist, rather than call for a change in the mechanics.nb. i should point out that this exact strategy to close down inursions earlier has been used before. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
10/30/2013,"potential solution: add sansha sites to go kill concord npc's or faction npc's. run site, get sansha lp, increase blue bar. if blue bar is increased enough, have mom despawn.... *edit* there really ought to be some drawbacks or conflict available here: you only collect lp if the sansha is not defeated, you lose standings with the faction npc's for helping out sanshas.... maybe running these sites while the mom is being attacked spawns new bomber waves at the mom site (for those who don't know, a bomber wave deals ~50k alpha and is responsible for most ship deaths in a mom site)."
10/30/2013,"i have spent sp that i regret. but i do find occasional unique uses for many of those skills.an alt trained mining enough to fly a mining barge. i have no intention of ever mining, but i do put those sp to use - pretending to mine in order to provide ganker warpins on lucrative gank targets.the only sp i really never, ever use are those on pi."
10/30/2013,ccp told you to come here and air your grievance?you so just got trolled by ccp.nothing erotica 1 has ever done could be considered cyberbullying. my own personal history has more contact with it.you are so egregiously wrong... there is even a faq for how wrong you are here.
10/30/2013,"no one even reads the post do they.. they just skim the damn thing and then start reading the comments... ridiculous.oh and trust me the last thing i'd like is to have to deal with seeing that flag lit up every day knowing someone else is back on my thread without even thinking it through just to insult me. you may feel im wrong, but not everyone does, unfortunately im the only one willing to stick my neck out for it. ccp isnt ********, they get 100's of support tickets about this kind of stuff a day, they didn't send me here to be trolled they sent me here to be a focal point for that frustration, but sadly i cant convince people to support me in open against people like the cfo of the cfc, even you gizznit, im dissapointed that someone who met me personally would think for a second i give a **** about attention from people in a video game.im going to keep this thread up , keep responding, and keep pushing the issue. feel free to continue to troll my thread with the only basis that this is a game. eventually people will stop hiding behind like button and secret personal in game chats and stick up to people who think that just because they play a game it gives them a right to act like the bottom of the barrel.and oh btw gm riven , you suck , told you it would be a **** storm. i told you i didn't trust the csm , and i hope you can see why now."

10/30/2013,"i resent the implication that i did not read, and listen to, your original post.the reason people aren't supporting you, is not because they are afraid of the cfc and something awful will happen to them, or because they are afraid of other reprisals by other groups or individuals. the reason is because you are just plain wrong. you aren't a focal point for the 'issue', if you are trying to be and this is the best focal point that can be mustered the planning committee for your cause needs to have a few more meetings. maybe hire a consultant.the activities certainly aren't nice, in fact they are downright cruel. but nobody is being forced to participate. up and until ccp says 'hey, guys..this isn't cool anymore. we now have rules in place to stop you from behaving badly. accept the change to the rules or walk.' there is nothing wrong with it in so far as the terms of the game.you are implying that the behavior is 'bottom of the barrel'. does anyone go hungry because they lost their space possessions? is anyone being denied basic human rights because their behavior has been spotlight? there are many forms of behavior that are reprehensible, that steal people's lives. none of which can happen in eve unless the victims are operating a rmt operation, and all those assets that were given away expecting to be doubled or tripled just happen to be their next paycheck.is that why you are so upset? is this putting a crimp in your rmt bot empire or something through an alt?or are you trying to apply some sort of extra moral behavior on the activities of pilots in eve. just because we play a game, that has no rules against a behavior that we enjoy, means that we will indulge in that behavior. not everyone will, but getting your bowels in a knot because someone does engage in it is about as useful as pissing on a nuclear reactor to cool it down.you want to 'push the issue' be my guest. ccp pushed you here so you could air your grievance. don't think they don't know what kind of reaction you would get. hence my 'you got trolled by ccp' comment. so, which is it? are you just some errant knight tilting at windmills? are you an rmt boss who lost a paycheck and are pissed? are you the all-in-one troll? or god forbid, do you actually believe the fountain of words you spew here and are riding a moral high horse?actually curious about how you see your role and your reasons for being in that role."

10/30/2013,"i'm sorry you feel personally slighted by me, perhaps i didn't elaborate clearly: i'm not implying you have some personal desire for attention, i'm saying you are employing the name of cyber-bulling to bring attention to the topic. to give an unrelated example that happened to me yesterday: a friend and i were discussing illegal immigration, and she brought up the recent gruesome murder of several children in ny by an illegal immigrant to emphasize criminal activity of illegal immigrants. the murder reference was simply a sensational approach to discussing the topic, just like cyberbullying is a sensational approach to discussing the actions of erotica 1. really, take a step back and look at waht erotica 1 has done, and keep the sensationalist stuff out of it. then we can truly evaluate whether erotica 1 has crossed the line: a.) protection racket: erotica & crew have ""claimed"" several systems as theirs. they run a protection racket to strong-arm isk out of any miner that wishes to utilize those systems. --- we could discuss the pro's and con's of this, but ccp generally gave it the thumbs up. believe it or not, but the new order recently moved into my highsec industrial home and attempted to strong arm my alt that utilizes the system to casually mine, invent, and manufacture. it has been entertaining..... b.) scamming: erotica & crew have scammed players out of ""all their assets"". i truly don't understand how you convince someone to hand over all their assets to another player in this game. that really just blows my mind, but it happens, and way more often than it should. --- we could discuss the pro's and con's of this, but ccp also gave scamming the thumbs up (as long as its not in the rookie channel). c.) humiliation: erotica & crew have potentially shamed and/or humiliated another eve player in a harmful manner. they recorded people ""flipping out"" on coms over their scamming & strong arming. they recorded people ""singing"" and willfully doing silly things in the hope of reclaiming scammed assets. then they publicized these recordings for anyone & everyone to know. --- this is where you believe they have crossed the line, and this is where you need to address the pro's and con's of allowing this behavior. pro: -- provides humor to many eve players. -- teaches, believe it or not. people learn from being humiliated, and other people learn from their public examples. -- provides content: this goes both ways, be it someone looking for the next laugh, or the humiliated looking for revenge. -- publicity: word of mouth is the best form of publicity that exists, and humorous quips spread the fastest. cons: -- potentially results in players leaving the game. ultimately, some people get so down trodden when scammed, humiliated, or faced with a conflict of interest they simply leave the game. that's unfortunate, but sometimes there isn't a solution that satisfies everyone. -- potentially causes people emotional damage. some people, after experiencing something humiliated, look back and laugh. some people get angry and goal driving. some people do something stupid. some people retain the hurt and truly are wouned from these experiences. to be honest though, this is a game, and anyone that is actually harmed from ingame activities really shouldn't be playing in the first place. so the question is, where is the line on humiliation, and did erotica cross it: did continue abusing someone showing signs of severe emotional distress (like threaten to commit suicide)? did they perform truly targeted harassment (as in the ""victim"" tried to move to a different area of space and they followed them system to system to poke at him, etc)? did they do something illegal (sexually explicit photos, rl asset scamming, rl harassment)? i haven't seen any evidence they crossed any of these lines, and that's the crux of the argument. p.s. you can turn off ""notifications"" by clicking ""unsubscribe"" on the top right of the forum thread."

10/31/2013,"i think incursion should be strictly low/null, and just rebuff missions."
10/31/2013,"to be honest, i disagree with this sentiment. i believe highsec incursions are overwhelmingly positive for eve in general. they are difficult enough to require teamwork, and operate in a manner where even more risk-adverse members of eve community will participate. in other words, they are one of the few highsec activities that actually brings players together. this is important for forming contacts, friendships, and more. believe it or not, forming these bonds, joining into a community, is one of the largest factors that govern player retention."
10/31/2013,this.its part of the learning curve in eve. i say no as well.
10/31/2013,"actually i did read the edit at the end of the op.amazing, i know. what i meant was to continue down that path, not here. i am not trying to shush or shutter debate, just that if it is a gameplay issue of harassment then this is not the place for it to be weighed. -op assembly hall rulesare we looking for debate on this, a common consensus on whether it is harassment or a single player asking for a ruling from ccp?mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
