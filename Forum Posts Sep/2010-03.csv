3/1/2010,"panther and sin need some major love still. speed bonus? lame. covops cloaks, i think yes. jump range... that's a tough one to make a call on.the ability to scan down cloakers would be a nice counter, but would have to be evaluated carefully. personally i would like to see a covops style t2 battlecruiser, maybe that would be a good role for such a ship. (t2 hurricane? pure sex!)*edit* nevermind. i re-evaluated my edit and edited it out."
3/1/2010,"not at t2 bc, a t2 destroyer- but anyway.a covops cloak is a must have to the bobs- sure it's powerful but also super expensive and skill-intensive.as to jump range... 2ly is horrible. with jdc iv i can jump 13ly with a carrier."

3/1/2010,"i'm sure that the recording tool would add 'some' extra load to a cpu but for most systems able to run eve now, i believe it will be a barely noticeable feature. to be honest, it does depend entirely on how much information really needs to be processed. and isn't all this information already cached or loaded somewhere? shouldn't be any major task to get this into a data file for later retrieval. but i could be biased, and seeing it from one angle. only one way to know for sure. get one of the developers to talk to the code monkeys about it, and give us that feedback! they would know more than anyone else how much extra strain on the client this would place, if any at all!"

3/1/2010,"it is, actually, but don't let that stop you~"
3/1/2010,"a war dec doesn't actually stop you mining, it just makes it very risky without combat support. it also doesn't force you to fly only combat ships.so the idea of an industry dec to force players into industrial ships is nothing like the same thing. i can't see how forcing people to bring ""industrial support"" could be added either, unless you have roaming asteroids that attack the pvpers and can only be taken down by hulk support.but now we are getting silly"

3/1/2010,"citing that invention scales as argument for keeping t2 bpos is kinda meh. since you have to scale in volume to achieve similar profits gained from a smaller number of items produced by t2 bpo, it means the markets become saturated with less people doing invention -> more competition -> lower margins, while people with bpos are largely unaffected.i would refrain from voting for the abolishment of t2 bpos if invented bpc me's could be brought to levels > 5. there are enough proposals for this. if that was done, bpos would still have an advantage, but at least the disparity of the production costs is reduced. and this would ofc bring t2 ship prices down, which i would welcome."
3/1/2010,"as already pointed out in page 1, 1 bpo is approximately the equivalent of 2,5 pe-4 bpc for production. i.e. 1 bpo do the same work of 2,5 production lines of bpc. so the 40 bpo that were seeded for each ship (if they are all still in game) are the equivalent of 100 production lines for that ship, i.e. 9,09 inventors with 11 production slots.probably banned and inactive accounts hold a large percentage of the best bpo.during the second seeding of t2 bpo there was a blog about them where it was said that a rtm cartel holding several bpo was banned en masse. at least some of those bpo were re-seeded with the second wave, but the bpo that were on banned accounts after that date have been removed from the game. the banning after the pos exploit probably had several good bpo banned as the people using the pos cheat to produce moon minerals were producing directly t2 stuff to reduce traceability."
3/1/2010,"well the only reason t2 bpos are being kept as-is to not screw the owners. apart from that, there is no argument for not fixing bad gamedesign.so, to protect the holy cows (somewhat), just let the t2 bpos be, but make invention more competitive by allowing for improved me. yeah, invention is fine, yadda yadda, but i want to see t2 ship prices drop."
3/1/2010,"let me tell you ... just because my costs drop, it doesnt mean i lower my prices. it just means i will make more profit. ;)business 101. works irl. works in eve."
3/1/2010,"it's great, isn't it? thank you for supporting my cause."
3/1/2010,"i'd dispute this - with direct competition for sales in a free market, margins get squeezed - you might decide not to drop your prices, but your competitor will in order to nick sales off you.someone else will do the same in order to nick sales off him, and you will at some stage be forced to do the same or your invesment in building materials will become tied up in stock you cannot shift, and you will therefore have no liquidity to invest in more materials for your next batches of production.it's these market forces that are keeping profit margins on t2 production tight, not t2 bpos.this is why you make no higher percentage margins prodicing hic / black op etc than you do items that have a t2 bpo equivalent. a lot of people seem convinced that removal of t2 bpos will somehow allow them to realise greater profit with their invented gear - it won't - if anything, having everyone building using invented neg me bpc will result in increased demand for materials to build the same number of finished products - if anything, your costs would most likely go up.the way to make money in t2 production right now is 'pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap' - this is why invention > bpo, because you can produce in volumes that dwarf what a bpo can produce - i'm not saying it's easy (especially if you build your own components) you need to be committed - but speak to anyone who owns a t2 bpo (or more) that is not exactly a logistical walk in the park, either."
3/1/2010,it works. ;)
3/1/2010,"you didn't propose replacing them with cash, you proposed shafting the people who own them. they're currently priced at something like 5 years profits at 0% waste. you propose giving them 2 years production at 20% waste. that's not compensation, that's a calculated insult. there is exactly one way to compensate them that wouldn't simply be a screwjob, and that's with cash(or goods, i suppose, but that'd be even more problematic)."

3/1/2010,definately agree and would go one step further. the functionality of the items hangar is getting noticably left behind as the rest of the interface develops. items should at least have corp hanger style tabs / folders to enable better organisation of what can quickly become a myriad of stuff./signed

3/1/2010,well that's something you did not have in your proposal. any chance you could add all the other aspects you left out in there too?plus it's still just another way to scam. or at least try.
3/1/2010,yes because people are going to go to all the trouble of burning out the mods on their ships and getting them shot into low hull in order to scam people out of a couple of minutes or a few million isk (which they won't even recieve). eve players are twisted but only the most chromosonally challenged griefer would find the motivation to do this sort of thing.supported.
3/1/2010,"this has to be a troll coming from you. off the top of my head, goons come to mind. this isn't even counting the kiddies that abound this game with the specific intent to annoy and make miserable as many players as possible simply for ""lulz"".without safeguards this would just become another useless tool to propogate epeen extensions in c&p: ""haha i jest sold sum idi0t a ravven with 99% damage haha!1 i r s0 awsum!!""and this is just what we need more of."
3/1/2010,"butthurt goon victim detected.while buying a 5% hull hp implant and loading up a ship with reinforced bulkheads before shooting it to within an inch of it's life before stripping it and contracting it from a station with no repair facility is somewhat appealing it's simply too much effort for such a limited tear harvest, especially when dealing with the problem is simple. this is actually quite an irritation for those of us wanting to contract ships with damaged mods/drones/crystals in far off lands to alts/friends/buyers. if some sort of damage indicater were included or added it may help to calm your carebear nerves matrixskye (what happened to mk1 anyway?)."
3/1/2010,"no. not really. but your comment proves my point quite well.your type (ie, the griefing type) go to great lengths to ""harvest tears"". you, above many others, know this.my carebear nerves are quite calm actually. thanks for your genuine concern though. and yes, if safeguards were added i'd be willing to support the issue. after years and years of playing eve i've come to the realization that many kiddies will take whatever opportunity and exploits they can get for cheap giggles and bragging rights. and too many giggles give me headaches :).and in reference to mk1, i retired him (biomassed). only to later realize that these forums need me :)."
3/1/2010,"i'd hardly say i'm the griefing type. i do agree with you that safeguards need to be in place for this sort of thing but even without them i must say that the potential effort:tear ratio is looking to be in favour of the 'griefed' rather than the griefer, considering that once your contract is up it may be hours or days before it is accepted with no guarentee of being online when it is accepted and whatnot. as always, one is left reminded of the old saying of 'buyer beware'."
3/1/2010,"one thing i have noticed in eve has been the recent large increase in account hacking on eve. security is a big concern with players and there are a number of ideas floating about on how to make accounts more secure.this idea is not meant to really protect an account, but rather hanger assets and possibly isk.now, a few years ago, back in my runescape playing days. jagex introduced a new feature into their mmorpg (in response to increasing security breaches). their system was an optional ingame pin code keypad.basically, in order to access your bank (which in runescape, meant all of your items and money world wide). a player would have to insert an x-number passcode to be allowed access to their bank. when accessing a bank, a keypad would display on the game and the players would click the appropriate code. (too many failures i believe locked you out for a bit).due to this, the number accounts with their items stolen before the account could be properly repossessed decreased dramatically in runescape.obviously there are a few fundamental differences between runescape and eve considering banks/hangers (in eve items can only be accessed at the hanger you left them in. and unlike runescape, isk is a digital credit rather then an item).however, implementing this sort of option could stop account hackers from being able to get to your hanger. (since they would need the pin). the program is also insusceptible to keyloggers. and possibly could be implemented to player donations/other wallet features.-can't be typed (done with mouse only)-runs in client-pin doesn't appear in any account information if account is stolen-optional thoughts? support?edit: this is what the runescape version of a security pin looks like.look at the f'n link"
3/1/2010,"from my impression from those presentations and dust trailer: dust won't start out as having an influence on 0.0, but instead on factional warfare. if this intention remains on the part of ccp, then it only makes sense that factional warfare be repaired to ensure a smooth integration of the two games.it may be appropriate for the guys at ccp iceland/eve team to talk to the dust team about about these interaction points and ensuring that the dust players don't get stuck fighting in the same 5 or 6 systems because no one wants to play fw in eve."
3/1/2010,counter-suggestion: make active tanking bonuses apply to rr mods as well. then active tanking becomes more viable in group pvp.

3/1/2010,"hp and self rep need to be looked at, but it needs to be combined with a look at rr fits on anything other than triage carriers and logis.it's a more complex problem than the op makes it."
3/1/2010,i'd have to say i like the idea :d
3/1/2010,bump with glue requested
3/1/2010,just thought of this. maybe an anti-cloaking bubble? you can't cloak inside the bubble? just a thought. and can't be overlapped with any type of warp disruption bubble. one or other. not both.
3/1/2010,"an active module that when activated provide a cloak disruptor on a 15 or 30<U+FFFD> angle in front of your ship with something like 5km range ,that can help to uncloak ships when they jump on a gate without being to much uber (and create a new t2 destroyer who will be the only one able to fit that module can be fun to)that can be fun to play that and give a more easier way to uncloak but keep need some piloting skills to use"
3/1/2010,"i would be opposed to any area effect that uncloaks everybody on the grid, or anything else of the sort; this negates the point of the cloak.i do, however, have sympathy for wanting to get rid of afk cloaking. it would be good if you posted a little bit more about what you wanted to achieve, i guess.things i would consent to:covert probe launcher on black ops ships, scans down cloaked vesselsmodule activation time on covert ops; 30 minutes cycle. after that, pilot has to reactivate."
3/1/2010,"maybe cloaks need to use more capacitor, or have a shorter cycle time, so afk cloakers have a harder time fitting their ship to permacloak. or like the guy said, a 30 minute cyle and cant auto re activate..."
3/1/2010,"the ""buff"" where cloaked ships now decloak each other that was supposed to be a bug that was going to be fixed and so far nothing has changed?imo covert ops cloaks should remain unprobable and be operational for as long as you want to run them (afk or not). the ships are designed around a covert cloak and thus shouldn't need to burn cap etc to keep them running.however i would be interested in hearing ideas for changes to the prototype (and t2 improved) cloaks.personally i think they should be sized so that, for example, a battleship needs a battleship sized cloak (and a capital needs a capital cloak) with higher fitting requirements. another idea would be for non-covert cloaked ships to show up on directional though masked from overview/visual so if you are on grid you could locate them given enough time and skill. this wouldn't stop people warping to a safe to cloak but would mean only covert ships can lurk at a gate to feed intel to the rest of the gang."
3/1/2010,i always wanted to see t2 destroyers able to dumbfire (like bombs) depth charges of sorts that fires a burst to decloak a ship within the aoe radius.-or-able to probe to the grid that a cloaked ship is on.. that means you can probe within a 250km radius from the ship... hardly a nerf to cloaking.
3/1/2010,in homeworld 2 you had a 'sensors ping' thingy on tiny little scout frigs that would unveil cloaked ships within a certain radius..i could see that working for eve as long as it was a specialised role that required an expensive ship and lots of skilling.
3/1/2010,new t2 destroyer tbh... like some sort of anti submarine hunter but in space! make it consume some sort of ammo or something with a decent cooldown and short to medium range (10-20km maybe). only problem is that it would spell the death knell for cov ops and recons jumping into 0.0 bubble camps.
3/1/2010,"if it was an on-grid ""ping"" it should be based upon sensor strength, in which most recons already have an advantage.id suggest bosting whatever counter there is for blockade runners though.edit: however i'm moe in love with a grid-wide probing than a local grid detection tool.cov ops are supposed to be ""the"" spy ship first, a combat ship second.a proto cloak should not be able to cover a capship in a hostil system for hours at a time, or someone going afk to work in a vaga only to decloak and strike whenever.. it's risk free.also, on the other side of the coin, i hate seeing ratters who safe+cloak the minute local goes +1.it's more the non-covops cloaks that are being abused."
3/1/2010,"i am really in favour of such things, however you indeed need to make sure it does not affect people who jump in gatecamp and want to get away by cloaking. a suficiently long warm up period would do that."
3/1/2010,that's easily fixed by giving it a 30s activation time.
3/1/2010,and disallow activation inside warp bubbles?
3/1/2010,for exampletheres many ways to prevent it from being overpowered
3/1/2010,"decloaking a covops jumping into a system is already a test of player skills: the skill of the tackler getting a line on the cloaker vs. the skill of the cloaker in evading the tackler. imo, no change is needed to the proximity distance as it can already be skewed in the tacklers favour by assigning a drone cloud (with the corresponding countermeasure of drone vulnerability to bombs). furthermore, there is already a sufficient module reactivation delay (even on a cocd) to prevent someone so decloaked from being able to recloak before being locked and subsequently tackled.a cloaked ship can't activate modules, reload charges, interact with celestial objects or target other ships - it has an effective dps of exactly zero. even after decloaking, it's ability to engage a target is penalized by the sensor recalibration delay. non-native cloakers incur further significant penalties to their scan resolution and their maximum cloaked velocities.i support the idea of ship-class sized cloaking devices - it seems reasonable to me that cloaking a capital should require more effort than cloaking a bs. with respect to non-native cloakers, i would consider supporting a very modest fuel consumption or the ability to probe out their general location (strongly dependent on the mechanism) if and only if that was balanced by a tradeoff against the existing drawbacks; however, in my mind such changes to native cloakers would completely invalidate their role and i'm am completely opposed to them. fundamentally, at least in my opinion, there isn't a problem with cloaked ships - the problem is when they uncloak. and for that there are already effective solutions that don't require changes to game mechanics with a very decided risk of borking an entire type of game play."
3/1/2010,"i agree that there is a need in many cases for a cloak- for supercaps and the like.however it's turned into a catch all and risk free. with the mwd+cloak trick it has become a way to bypass mechanics that people are saying probing would invalidate.a 30s module delay for the probe (i.e. delayed like an armor repper) and the inability to use the probe in a bubble are two excellent ideas to offset and allow the advantage of cloaking to remain.fuel consumption is a good idea in itself, but that addresses afk cloakers only. this would address many things such as farmers and macros in 0.0 which are impossible to catch."
3/1/2010,this topic seems to keep rearing its ugly and useless head over and over add nauseum...there is nothing wrong with the mechanics..thousands of eve players agree..leave cloaking alone...
3/1/2010,"if you are a mercenary corporation i would assume you would like to brag about successful contracts, not how much isk you've killed. is a merc corp fail if they were contracted to shut down a region against a certain corp/alliance and succeeded so well that the alliance never undocked to get killed in a measurable quantity?none what so ever, but kill mails for ships are already in game however irrelevant i hold them. the only reason i pay attention to my killboard is to check off things on my killboard bingo. need a black ops, and an orca and i win! of course i laugh at fail fits just like everyone else, however it's the team organization, planning and execution that i hold in higher regard (also a well executed gank is partial to my heart).i won't be upset at all if pod mails show up, however that does not change the fact that i see no good use for it other than another way to ""haha"" at someone you killed."

3/1/2010,"not needed / not supported. the killmail system already encourages killmailwhoring and discourages engaging when the outcome is not certain, this is bad enough. the last thing we need is yet more epeen fodder reinforcing this behaviour (of which i have been just as guilty of in the past) mostly due to concern over kb efficiency and other meaningless crap."
3/1/2010,"i don't support it primarily because this additional information would have only 1 effect: more hate speech in locali get enough snide remarks just because i like to fly expensive ships.there's not a single situation where seeing someone's implants wouldn't cause more negativity. either it'll be ""lol noob doesn't even have cheap implants""or""lol noob just lost his implants""the best thing is not to feed the trolls."
3/1/2010,*support*its a good thing. but i'd like this feature implemented along with neutral scanner that has been proposed about a week ago.
3/1/2010,"not supportedhere, how about this reason.it would increase pod killing for no other reason than to find out what implants someone had.i believe ccp and as such concord doesn't support pod killing, which is why you get a huge status hit for doing it when in low sec high sec. all this would do is promote pod killing anyone who happens by for no other reason than to see what they had in their head.i would hazard a guess as this is why it isn't included already."
3/1/2010,exactly my thoughts
3/1/2010,"i hate the fact that when i undock into a busy mining system, or a tradehub, i look around to see at least 5 other people with the exact same ship as me. with a little, uncomplicated editor you could instantly introduce the feeling of uniqueness. i dont want custom skins, or anything else that would represent a need for speed type customisations. just a little something to make me stand out from the crowd, thats all.+1"

3/1/2010,"do it like a courier mission with a lowsec start, but supply a single run bpc for an item from a *randomized* list of faction items instead of isk or lp so that it acts as a net isk sink and feels more like gambling. and, oh yes, don't tell the player what the reward is until after they've completed the mission so that they don't just decline missions until a super awesome item pops up. have the low sec mission giver supply a destination in hisec (so that it's impossible to portal someone from a to b for mad monies) with an item or items drawn from a random list of illegal items in that particular section of hisec that must be purchased from either an npc or player sell order. these items should all be sooper illegal and impossible to market/contract in hisec. the target cost for the cargo for these missions should be between 10 and 20 million isk. npc customs agents should also receive a boost of some sort to their detection skillz. if they spot contraband, the smuggler should get gcc and enjoy the delights of being chased by crazed faction police. tl;dr version:players haul 20-30mil worth of random items (purchased from npcs or players) available only in lowsec that trigger gcc and faction police chasing if detected to random hisec locations in return for a random one run bpc for an item from any empire/pirate faction.pros: -- creates demand for funky items in lowsec, and demand means supply means targets-- acts as a net isk outflow -- creates possibility for fun new bpc/bpos eg: exotic dancer bpo-- might eat up some minerals-- gambling is fun-- hilarious tear threads from players getting wtfpwnt by faction policecons: -- if too easy, increases the supply of faction gear which could slay the t2 market (could be fixed by making the popo more aggressive, raising target haul value, or lowering the chance for one of the better bpcs to show up)-- could be overly addictive to people who liked the gambling npc in diablo 2--harvey birdman, attorney at caw!"

3/1/2010,"the idea is to make tactical shield manipulation actually do something usefull. right now the only application is as prerequisite for modules. skill is bad for both shield and armor tankers. for shield tankers its bad because without the skill shield stay longer on the peak recharge rate, for armor tankers its bad, because damage which bleeds through shield to armor can be repaired anyway and again it reduces shield effective hp because shield stays less time on the peak recharge rate. why not give it some useful meaningful role ? for example give 10% to recharge rate at 5 or increase point of peak recharge rate to 40-45% at 5 (it is tactical shield manipulation after all). do something meaningful with it, we do not want any drastic alterations, because changing skill mechanics to big degree is bad, people train something for long time and then all of a sudden they realize that skills is useless for them or doesn't work like they expected anymore (like happened to cruise missiles when sb mechanics was changed). so do some minor adjustment to make it really useful for tanking and keep it in line with concept of active tanking."

3/1/2010,"you too go back under your bridgei never asserted that this is exactly what should be done, if trolls would ve actually read the posts they are trolling (which never happens unfortenantly), then you would ve read part of it which says for example"
3/1/2010,tactical shield manipulation is fine as is. the extra resists for passive hardeners or without cap are actually useful.
3/1/2010,omg
3/1/2010,derp ;)
3/1/2010,should i have written active hardeners without cap?*continues neuting sokratesz' wyvern*
3/1/2010,"nah you should have looked up the skill if you dont know what it does.but there are enough other skills that are mainly/only used to unlock stuff, like jury rigging."
3/1/2010,the idea is to read the skill clearly and carefully and understand that its premise is to reduce the amount of damage that pierces shields through to armor when they are at 25%. (other than it being a required skill for invun. fields and other)not to act like an asshat nooblet who knows nothing of what he speaks.oh..i meant to say not supported.
3/1/2010,i really should have went to bed instead of posting on the forums. but here i am. stay tuned for more postings where i am too tired.
3/1/2010,"that's the problem with the proposal, you ask for change but leave the actual solution completely open. how can we support that?tempted to call op a troll..."
3/1/2010,"tsm is the only skill in the game that actively harms you as you train it higher. it's absurd, and needs changing. that said, i have no really good idea what ought to be done with it. the only things that come to mind that don't step on the toes of existing skills or have silly power levels are either to reduce the cap needs of shield hardeners(say 10%/level, and up their base need 25% or so) or maybe some kind of fiddling with the shape of the shield recharge curve. i think the first of those is decent, and the second is likely to be a terrible idea."
3/1/2010,why does it harm you?
3/1/2010,"i agree with making the skill usefulll. maybe we could increase the width of the max recharge point of shield by a bit with each level. meaning peak recharge rate will be achieved in a grater range of values for shield percentage. either way, it should be come useful. now it can only have minor aesthetic value to armor tankers."
3/1/2010,"i believe what they're getting at is that because damage can pierce the shields, it removes damage from the shields and puts it on the armor, thus lowering the actual damage the shield takes, keeping it's level higher for better recharge.but, from what i can remember, shields only get pierced below 25%, so that argument is kinda dumb as the amount of difference is so marginal. i would say that a good change to this would be to reduce the capacitor needs for shield hardeners and invuls as they tend to use quite a lot of cap, and remove the shield piercing effect all together from the skill. invul's are like 3.3 cap/s for t2 and i think regular hardeners are like 2-2.5 off the top of my head.or another option instead would be to reduce cpu for shield hardening mods which i think most people would agree is a needed change, especially for capital ships."
3/1/2010,"the myth that tsm hurts shield tankers is laughable. it has been debunked over and over again.first, if your tank is 25%< then your tank is broken (passively speaking, actively possible). second, a shield tanker that lets damage bleed into his shields will die faster then a tanker that doesn't. tsm actually helps a shield tanker by stopping attacks from getting to the armor, if a shield tanker is taking armor damage, even if his shields can cope with the damage at, lets say, the 15% mark, eventually he will die. since he is taking armor damage.in short. tsm is actually good and you can go look up the super detailed posts that make mine look like a kid's understanding as to why you're wrong./notsupported.btw your suggestion would make passive tanking overpowered and nobody would active tank anymore."
3/1/2010,"faithfully supported. seeing very dramatic and perfectly homogeneous hit effects even for a shot that completely missed is flat out retired. ccp, please join this century."
3/1/2010,can we please get a csm candidate to support this
3/1/2010,"makes good sense, also since several ships have nos as their main ewar."
3/1/2010,"in all honesty, i think insurance payouts need to be spoken about in another thread.in regard to your addition, i did raise this in an earlier version of this ""fix"" idea/thread, but as the original post states: purpose: to create a working and less exploitable bounty system that is not so much designed to hurt pirates/gankers/griefers as it is to introduce a thrilling new career into the game for those who like to play the hunter! not so much for whiner n00bs to get revenge on pirates. thx"

3/1/2010,"if you can see what corporation an individual is in, then you can see what individuals are in the corporation, makes perfect logical sense to me. i think this was supose to be here for a while. i actually like it."
3/1/2010,"while there may be more people in 0.0, the changes dominion brought make it even harder to farm ratters which is annoying as ****. it's like they don't want anyone to die unless it's organized combat. this paired with the long ago addition of jump bridges make 0.0 a virtual dead zone for anything other than organized combat groups fighting each other, or boring ass camping/hot dropping on bridges.i'd strongly suggest a lot of warp scrambling rats in any signiture spawns to prevent the overwhelming protection these things give ratters. there is just far too little opportunity to scan down ratters in time before they can safe up. at least when people were ratting/mining in belts, you had a slim chance to catch competent people if you were solid at scanning. 0.0 is far to populated these days to be such a barren waste land for roaming/ganking. quit protecting the care bears so much."
3/1/2010,all rats in 0.0 should scramble rewards should be boosted respectively however.
3/1/2010,"i want to see better npc design across the board, yes. proper tackle seems like a natural part of that to me. the effect it would have on roaming pvp is a nice benefit as well."
3/1/2010,"maybe you just need more practise. 0.0 is still an empty waste land, i dont see how making it even more an empty waste land would help you."

3/1/2010,"some good discussion, altho i must admit i'm starting to get somewhat disappointed about the csm (it's not the fault of only current represantives tho). mainly as i have impression growing in me that csm is not taking overly seriously idea of representing community and seem to be more lobbyng for their own personal playstyles. the roots of this feeling reach back to the time of previous csm though. for example thinking that inability to dock while scrambled is reasonable idea rubs me in the wrong way to a degree so far only some rather populist real politicans have managed so far. so far i had impression that people in that board are somewhat intelligent just mostly ignored by ccp. and no - being able to get overview data before undocking does not make that idea good. docking games are lame, but there is far better options to cure that without screwing over anyone who has to move capital ship thru low sec. i have ofc not written the csm off just yet and plan to vote again in the next elections also with all my accounts as i have done so far. i like to believe that nodding in agreement to that bad idea by ccp was result of serious hangover, not some disability in the thinking process of our representatives. most of the ideas discussed were relatively reasonable. i do not agree to several of them, but that is life - can't please everyone. but seriously - inability to dock while scrammed ."
3/1/2010,"""the csm would like to be utilized more and would like ccp to be more proactive in bringing issues to them.""translation: the csm would like to feel more important. ""the csm does not see a need for a term limit."" um, hell yes the do. stupid idea.""the csm would like ccp to investigate the feasibility of improving access to nullsec""do something that gets rid of, or discourages power blocks and the smaller alliances will feel its worth going into 0.0 and staking a claim. right now it is either you are part of the power block or a renter (which is the same thing except you are paying to be part of the power block ). it is virtually impossible to go into 0.0 otherwise. seriously, change standings to have fees like war decs. the more blues you make, the more you pay.""the meeting discussed possible changes to the mechanics of the undocking game.""ability to see overview before you undock? sure, as long as i get to see who and what they are undocking with before they undock. ""look guys, they are flying this, and there is those, so fit specific."" undock, gank, redock.correct me if i am wrong, but if your whole alliance/whatever blue list is camped in and don't have one guy in cov ops to relay intel on what is outside station, then thats your own fault. is summary, horrible idea. the idea of the bigger the ship, the longer it takes to dock is far better. also remote whatever should count as aggression already. this whole, ""i want to be part of the fight without risk."" thing is crap.""the issue of the use of titans and doomsday devices in low-sec was discussed. csm believes that low-sec use of titans and doomsdays should be reinstated.""translation: we were having tons of fun doing the drive-by dd's in low sec with little to no risk after you took away our drive-by dd's in 0.0 with little to no risk. please bring that back. horrible idea.""the csm would like to have a budget of development time dedicated to going through a backlog of projects that they prioritize.""translation: we would like to have control of how you spend some of your budget directly.if you really want that then perhaps you should get a job at ccp and work you way up to management.""the csm calls for far more dialogue with ccp regarding game design as it is happening rather than after its release.""again, csm wanting to be recognized as game designers without actually working at ccp. drop off an application while you are there at the summit. also maybe ccp is hesitant about providing you guys with inside info just for it to be larksoned.""the csm would like warfare links and information warfare looked at. ccp will consider whether they need to be changed but is concerned about making them overpowered.""the only set that needs looked at is the information ones. they are worthless to bother fitting. not to mention the eos is a pointless waste of space right now with every aspect of it being lol. from lol gang bonuses to lol blasters to lol drones to lol tank. astarte too for that matter...""the csm was unhappy about a recently installed 5 minute cool down timer on forum posting. ccp announced that the timer will be reduced.""if the people that hate the timer are too lazy to log out and log back in to post something else, then the post must not have been worthy enough. the 5 minute timer is fine.""the csm expressed concern over heavy handed forum moderation.""orly? you should see the boards on other games out there. the rest is not bad i guess. definetly the best csm so far, sadly that is not saying much. keep things scandal free and the players will take the csm more seriously, thus ccp will take the csm more seriously and you will finally get to feel like egods."
3/1/2010,"no, we want to be able to give more adequate feedback about the things ccp is working on.xhagen proposed this along with the 1-year term, and we all agreed that it would be for the betterment of the csm and the relations with ccp....so basically you agree? we were talking about 'access' in its most basic form btw.read the rest, this ties in with the scram-unable to dock thing. fail. both csm and ccp felt that lowsec dd's were conflict drivers. not sure if you were aware of it but back in december we as a corp and tri as alliance were getting ready to bait and gank a titan - but it got nerfed before it could be executed. lowsec dd's require people to be more careful with what they do and may lead to epic battles once people get the hang of it.again this was proposed by ccp and we said, 'wow...ok cool' and then proceeded to discuss a ****ton of details about it."
3/1/2010,"no, we just want to be able to give more adequate feedback.ndano it's not, if you must relog just to circumvent it that just shows how wrong it is. ...sorry marlona that was a pretty poor attempt at criticism."
3/1/2010,"just out of curiousity...i am assuming that you don't include any of the beam weapons as a gun since they are still vastly more powerful than any other weapon system in the game? best range band, best tracking, best damage, virtually no ammo, instant ammo switching....oh and they use a little cap on ships designed specifically to have higher cap recharge than all the other ships of the same class.just curious ya know?"
3/1/2010,the discussion came up because a couple of csm members have issues with hybrids. at no point was there any discussion on nerfing the other guns just talk about possible boosts to hybrids and/or gallente ships in general.
3/1/2010,"and i agree with that notion but the minutes are what i quoted which is why i am curious. are the minutes wrong, were they comparing arty to rails and blasters to ac's, or did someone seriously think projectiles were the best weapon system overall?i mean projectiles use no cap but minmatar ships almost universally have the lowest cap size and recharge in return while the opposite is true of lasers and yet look at all the measurables and unmeasurables that lasers get over all the other systems which results in their superiority and is reflected statistically.anyways just was curious about that one statement was all. glad to hear you are fighting for the treaty system. i really want to see that one take place. i mean a treaty that allows mission runners to run lvl 5's in low sec for a cut of the profits to their guardians and so on just seems like a win win for all involved."
3/1/2010,"how about the players give ccp feedback about what they are working on?i for one welcome our new csm dictatorsnerf power blocks or you will wind up with the same scenario of what current pirates in low-sec non-stop complain about:""how come care bears don't want to do missions in low sec?""it has already been stated that even if level 4 missions were all moved to low sec, the majority of the eve population would still prefer to do level 3 missions in empire. its the gank factor. same principle can be applied to your question of, ""why won't small alliances move into 0.0?""true you have to pay for sov now, but that does not stop the, ""well, we like this space over here, but lets not pay for it. now if someone tries to claim sov, we will just blob the crap out of them with our power block and kill their tcu. if we can't have it, no one can!""so in closing on this section, yes, i agress something has got to be done to get rid of the 20-25k man blue list.i read everything before posting anything. all it will do is encourage docking to happen more often so everyone can have eyes with no risk. scraming to prevent docking i have mixed feelings about.titans should not be allowed to fire their dd if they have initiated warp drive.fixed?i'm teasing. seriously, its csm wanting more power and then get themselves into a position where to avoid players questions they throw out the ""nda"" statement. the majority of the csm represents a minorty of eve.oh, well who could have predicted this.no it is, if players are not being subjected to massive spam and accounts hacked and such just shows how well it is working. reducing the timer is not the solution you are looking for...i thought this is where you throw up the ""nda"" thing?"
3/1/2010,"the 25% quote is from the devblog as linked in my post which was sent to us in our ""welcome to the csm"" emails.thus i assume the wiki is incorrect however i will try to get this clarified this week..."
3/1/2010,"the inability to see or interact with a 'character' is one of the most cited shortfalls of eve online by new players and game journalists. it is the first thing every new player notices, to not dedicate development time to the project would be a poor business decision.even so saying, there is a fair portion of the player base that would like to see this added as can be seen in this thread. i look forward to seeing the finished product."
3/2/2010,"i think the issues as they're presented have been pretty well thrashed out, so i'll spare you my views -- they aren't unique.what concerns me though, is that all of these decisions seems to ignore a couple of fundamentals of gaming, most notably the ongoing development of new players. calculating how much an in-game miner affects the in-game economy is interesting; but let's also look at how those accounts affect the overall eve picture in terms of long term existence.historically, roughly 5 years in and an mmo starts to be ""at risk"". around this time, most mmos have run up on the rocks, and in most cases it has to do with diminishing player community and recruitment. if the game changes in such a way that a class of character becomes extinct, that can start to decay the entire game. lets face it  eve needs miners and mission runners and especially noobs. wipe out any class and you put the game at risk. anyone want to take a look at that?"
3/2/2010,"one other thing: its interesting to note that removing ceilings and floors on various commodities does in fact affect the economy here. note however that when all prices fall, youre not correcting; youre in a deflationary spiral. and eve most definitely is in deflation. reduction in the price of tritanium, for instance, is utterly meaningless unless you consider it in terms of the overall economy. minerals are down. and so are ships. and components. undsovetter be careful what major economic cogs you recommend changing now. unless theyre considered in terms of the overall economy, the results may be both surprising -- and grisly."

3/2/2010,/sign
3/2/2010,add the advanced ai rats to lowsec (and 0.0) which would encourage ship fits closer to pvp fit and make it so those ratting have a competent pvp setup as well.
3/2/2010,"low-sec is needing a boost, some good ideas listed."
3/2/2010,"not signed, trying to turn low-sec into 0.0 and allow pirate/pvp corps to build mini empires isn't going to ""fix"" low-sec in anyway. apart from 1, 6 and 9 the rest of the ops points sound good. as for making low-sec dangerous, it is dangerous enough, in fact so dangerous that people don't want to venture into low-sec as much as possible. the problem is just that, people don't have a good enough incentive to come to low-sec.as for cyno-jammers in low-sec, i think cap-warfare should be strictly restricted to 0.0, caps have no place in low-sec, especially now that there are jump freighters."
3/2/2010,"ok first off, i'll support the idea of ""a low sec expansion or upgrade"" but not the ideas presented. (sorry but we don't need sov warfare in low sec)i'm not a fan of any sort of system upgrades done by players. that to me is too much like sov warfare and next thing you know all the hoards or null sec blobs coming into low sec stealing everything. (example look the current situation with low sec moons)we already see many null sec alliances making moves on the moons all across low sec, which cuts out income possibilities for many low sec groups. no one in low sec can really compete when any of the major power blocs decide they want moons in low sec. if you allow for system upgrades, or the ability to control systems for some sort of benefit, it would turn into boring sov warfare, that many of us have no interest in.as far as capitols, i think something needs to be done about them as there are far too many floating around low sec. when a fw militia can drop 9 carriers into a fight and have dreads on stand by, it's easy to see things aren't what they should be in low sec. i do agree something needs to be done to curve the usage of capitols in low sec, but i don't think it would be right to be able to cyno jam them out of systems. if you let pirates upgrade systems to that extent, certain groups would just grab up high traffic boarder systems and never leave. we already see this to some extent. imo low sec needs to be opened up a bit. we need ""newly"" found systems or new gates added to make roaming a bit more enticing to various areas. i also think high sec cearbears have it far too easy and the risk vs reward just is not there to get them to want to adventure out into low sec.i won't say that all level 4's should be moved to low sec, but i do think all ""high ranking"" agents should be moved to low sec. i say any agent that is quality 10 and down should be in high sec. any agent that is quality 11 and up should be in low sec. this means any agent from level 1 through 4 that is above quality 10 ""should"" be in low sec. the reason for this, is it would add more risk for the reward and it would entice younger players to take a stab a pvp sooner than they might generally do. risk vs reward, remember that folks?miners should also get more reward from low sec, but i'm not sure how to do it with out affecting the whole eve mineral basket. possibly give them faster laser cycle times because of such and such reason that could be worked into a story. this would give miners a ""reason"" to come into low sec to mine, they would earn more because they are mining more with the faster cycle times in low sec. something like this likely wouldn't affect the mineral basket much but would give the reward that is needed to get them into low sec. once again, risk vs reward..if you notice, none of my ideas are about things for pirates, because having more targets in low sec is reward enough for real pirates. we don't need systems or upgrades we need people in space.continued"
3/2/2010,"continued..the one area i would like to see changed, is how pirates react with fw members. let's face it, most pirates are at a very big disadvantage to the blobs the militia's can muster up at the drop of a hat. much less, we have to fight them under gate guns causing us to have to fly heavy or with lots of logistics. i don't think gate guns should go away as there should be risk to us pirate types, however i do think ccp should think about no gate guns if we the target is in fw. we have fw guys whom fight each other day in and out on gates and stations. they fight on gates and stations, that are owned by their various empires, yet the gates don't attack the guys from the other side, so why should they attack pirates?i completely agree with having gate guns there to hinder attacks on civilian (non militia) members. however militia members are in low sec in most cases to pvp. they accept the risks of low sec and come there for the action. why not allow us pirate types, the ability to fight them unmolested from gate guns for a short amount of time? it would be nice to be able to not have to fly a bc and above or have logistics in every gang because we can't fight on gates with out it.again i'm not saying no gate guns, but rather let us get involved in fights on gates with militia members with out having to fly bs's & bc's or hac's all the time.to add to this i will say i really do not like gate ""extended"" gate camps. it think it's a lame form of lazy pvp when you do nothing but sit on a high traffic gate ganking people.perhaps having the gate guns do more dps if the same ships are on the gates for an extended amount of time. i'm not sure how this would work though, because most likely certain groups would just blob up even more to tank the guns.i do think it would be nice to fight the fw guys in small faster ships but also do something to hinder the 23/7 gate camping types."
3/2/2010,"agree with everything you are saying m8. the main issue with low-sec is the lack of people in it and ccp should try to find solutions to the ""low-sec problem"" from that vantage point.bs rats were a good start, did it change much? probably not but i am certain it had a little impact on trying to get new players into low-sec. e.g. a new player will do a lvl 1 mission and get about lets say 50k isk reward for it. if he goes to low-sec and kills a 500k bs rat he will save a lot of time in terms of gaining capital initially. however for more advanced players ratting in low-sec is not viable atm. i am not saying low-sec should have 0.0 spawns but spawns that are closer to 0.0 quality.low-sec is supposed to be a stepping stone for 0.0 as well as a place to live and make some kind of a living for people if they choose to do so. at the moment it isn't doing either of those things in a good way. either risks are too low (e.g. fw missions where you only have to kill 1 npc in most missions) or the risk vs reward is just not worth it in the first place."
3/2/2010,"i like a lot of the ideas and i would love to fight more pirates, pirate wars sounds hell interesting"
3/2/2010,"those who whine about gatecamping obviously have absolutely no idea how inherently risky it is, as the united (lol) demonstrate on a daily basiscamping a gate 23/7 only makes you a big, fat target 23/7as for the rest of the ideas some are meh but i'm supporting just because lowsec needs some real boost"
3/2/2010,supported idea.
3/2/2010,"i think that the idea that it is a stepping stone to 0.0 is a perception that has lead low sec into its current state. regardless of their original intentions or of how it is commonly viewed, low-sec has moved beyond that and needs to be analyzed with what is actually happening there rather then what they thought would happen. first off the reality is it doesn<U+FFFD>t work that way, the stepping stone into 0.0 is to go to 0.0. second, as it stands there are three distinct areas of space with a quasi fourth. high sec, low sec, 0.0 and maybe wormholes. they share similarities but for the most part are distinct in and of themselves and don't follow a progressively graduated curve. in other words, there is no curve players can climb going up from high sec at the low to 0.0 at the climax. each area of space needs to be treated on its own, unless ccp manages to shoehorn in some sort of progressive mechanic ramping up to 0.0. i doubt they could manage it, and even if it were possible the game resultant would probably not be the game we all know and love (it'd be like wow instead).all this is to say that low-sec requires its own treatments and focus regardless of 0.0 or high-sec. from its current state of being it would seem to me that ccp hasn<U+FFFD>t arrived there yet, they will though i think, as the game evolves further. i just wish it was sooner rather then later."
3/2/2010,actually due to gate guns lowsec requires far more sp than 0.0
3/2/2010,"indeed, and there are the security hits, and the timers, and the lack of bubbles, and the lack of bombs, and whatever else i'm missing. they really are two very distinct and separate areas. as much as high sec is different from either of them."
3/2/2010,why not.
3/2/2010,would be really helpful.
3/2/2010,really annoying to have a station bookmarked and you can't align to the bm...
3/2/2010,"i wholeheartedly support it. so tired of the ambient sounds, drowning out everything else or just never ending. station ambient sounds while in space, etc. or my artillery falling silent in the middle of a fight. it's sad, but a very common statement from my friends who play eve is: ""eve has sound?"". because they play with it off, rather than deal with it."

3/2/2010,"on one hand i love watching eve movies and a 'battle recorder' would allow much improved presentation.on the other, i can't help thinking that this would have the potential to be seriously exploited in the same way that bacon used the logserver information."
3/2/2010,"cash shouldn't really be an option. they should leave the same way they came in. look at it like anything else in this game, investing in anything is a gamble. did the people who originally recieved them pay anything for them? i honestly don't know because i don't think i was around then. eve is a game of chances, just like undocking. when the time comes, devblog the time and date it'll happen. then at that time, they become max run bpc's. problem solved. if you bought em from someone else, that person made a hefty profit and the buyer made a bad investment (i'm sure they made a nice profit while they had it anyway). if the person who received them never sold them, it never really benefitted anyone but that person anyway and no harm done."
3/2/2010,"1) they were brought with rp, everything you had with the agent the moment you accepted the offer. at the time of the first seeding datacores were not an option (they were introduced 2 year later) so training those skill was a hit or miss proposition.2) can i turn all your bpo to max run bpc? can i turn your ships to a version that will last 100 undocking? that is what you are suggesting."
3/2/2010,"1) then pay the owner in rp as repayment. paying out what people pay for the item isn't solid value. if someone paid an amount more than it was worth to have it, that shouldn't give them the right to claim what they paid. 2) can i turn all your bpo to max run bpc? sure go ahead lol. the undocking part of your post is nonsense tbh. these itemsfor isk value though, and though there isn't one, i used the armageddon and redeemer for an example. 596,250,000 isk for a geddon bpo. geddons go for around 45mil or so, we'll say the avg is 45mil. 596,250,000/45,000,000= 13.2513.25x695,000,000(is random current price of a redeemer)= 9,208,750,000.bpo owner can be awarded just over 9bil if they owned the redeemer bpo. this is an example, so don't get your panties in a wad about a redeemer bpo. people who invested in more valuable items will get a substantial payback but not near what they did pay for it. will people get screwed? sure. it's eve, get over it. it will not break the bank of those who own them if they paid a huge sum already. if investors get ****ed, talk to those people who invested in enron and borrow a tissue. these bpo's shouldn't be in the game unless everyone can be able to get their own. for the trolls to come, kleenex? fly safe."
3/2/2010,"who cares about their loss , come on every change in eve affects people and many of us lost isk due to changes many times, why should they be exceptioned from this? why should keep items in for some privileged ""elit"" who were lucky when these bpos were shared? also bpo-s effect markets maybe not the modules,but ships/ammos definitely. is that right ? i dont think so . if they want to make money they should be join the inventors ranks or something else like the rest of us."
3/2/2010,"do you have any clue about how much value you are speaking off?just as an example... cap recharger ii bpos sell for 70-80bn. for easier math lets say plexes are 250m for $15. we are talking about $4200-4800.sabre bpo was 50bn, hulk over 100bn.when ccp wanted to reduce the cost of motherships to like 6bn they were already thinking on how to reimburse the owners for the loss in value. and that was just a price reduction of 9-10bn.some people worked really hard to actually *buy* their bpos.and the hulk bpo is actually funny. only 11% of the hulks come from bpos. so 89% are build by happy inventor. seems like the market is fine?but of course whining about ""i dont have a t2 bpo, so others shouldnt have either"" is so much easier than actually doing research and producing the right things."
3/2/2010,"maybe that 70-80bill is overpriced , but still who cares? i dont. they made their choices when bought the bpo.just like that bad investment. so they should get special treatment just because they are t2 bpo owners?also this math about isk-->$ is against eula ,you cant trade isk to realmoney legally.so for hulk it is 11% ,then what? does it somehow proove that t2 bpos are fine then ,no absolutly not.t2 bpos are a bad game design they should gone just like the seed of them.there are these items which are unavailable for newcommers to eve just because they werent playing when bpos were seeded, only possible way to get them is to buy them from their current owners willing to sell them at a very overpriced rate.oh if ccp thinks they should get reimbuse then do so but still they should remove them from game."
3/2/2010,how is a t2 bpo unavailable to you? you can buy them. will it cost you lots of money? sure.you think it is too much money? you dont want it enough. it is easy enough to earn 50-100bn with invention in a year and buy yourself a t2 bpo.hell there are some nice t2 missile bpos for sale atm that go below 5bn buyout.was the idea bad to introduce them through a lottery style? mostlikely. (even without the t20 thingie) do we need more t2 bpos? no. but all that doesnt mean you should rip them out of the game either. they are not game breaking either.i just wonder naomi ... do you actually do t2 production?
3/2/2010,"both thing have exactly the same sense (or better, lack of it) of your proposal: turning a permanent item into a limited use one. i would prefer to see my bpo turned to an unusable but collection worthy ""framed t2 bpo"" to hung in my room when incarna become active that have it turned to a consumable with a limited number of uses. you find turning your ship to a item with a finite number of uses nonsense, but it is exactly what you are suggesting for the bpo."
3/2/2010,"venkul, you truly do not know what you mean. according to you, if you undock, you automatically lose a ship. not just the chance, thereof. everyone undocks, not just me and a select few.darius, all t2 bpo's aren't available for sale, so how are all of them available for me to buy any one of them i want? i have no chance to buy a particular one i may want. which makes the t2 bpo control monopolizing and unfair."
3/2/2010,the broken part is not that they exist and give advantage over invention. the broken part is they cant be taken by force ( assuming owner has half brain and farms it at station ).
3/2/2010,"leaving out bpos that werent seeded (marauders, eaf), i am sure if you wave with enough money you will find someone who will sell you that seeded bpo."
3/2/2010,"im a bit bored so will join in.actually wasnt invention was brought in to circumvent bpo holders who were being pilloried for price fixing (re sellers and critical supply shortages - were not to blame at all of course) so what you are implying there is that the lowest priced t2 item in any station is made from a bpo and is not invented. wow never knew that - care to back it up with some data?and i would say your 'tens of hundreds' of would be inventors would blame lack of lab slot availability than prices at this point in time.agree with you on the inconsistency part. however, were not the t2 bpos (especially ships) material requirements significantly changed recently due to the failure of alchemy and rare moon shortage.?here are some approximate figures for a well researched hac bpo .(no its not mine- wish it was though)basing purely on buy order prices - after all you want it to sell immediately.not going anywhere near data core prices etc how you get them / value them is up to you.average buy order price 100mcost to build ( not including base ship) 65m (27m on plates 17m on microprocessors) profit around 30m ( taxes and ship taken into account)time it takes in station to build 1.25 days approx so lets say 6 a weekthus 6/7 of 30m = 25m a day. not really.thus at a me -4 bpc (50% waste) 97.5m yes at that me you are not going to compete . however you would not build a battleship at me0 either and expect to be profitable. hence the use of decryptors .smaller items sell very well ( as long as you dont do the hub routes)most older players are lazy and dont want to travel 10+ jumps to save a few k iski myself invent ( lab slots permitting) and where the average is around 600k i sell mine for 900+k easily. allowing decryptors to become more readily available would be nice though.im sorry i cannot support the motion.0bi"
3/2/2010,"no. not at all.leave the choice to everyone, they don't do any harm at all. buy a t2 bpo and compete with inventors if you want to or buy and research its t1 equivalent, do the copies and the research jobs if you want to.but please, do us a favour and use only npc facilities when inventing! ..."
3/2/2010,bumping back to the first page.
3/2/2010,"are you guys *honestly* complaining that you might get scammed over damaged items? are you freaking kidding me? as long as there is a thing that lets you know damaged status of the items before accepting the contract, you would have no one to blame but yourself. all you are doing at this point is arguing that amarr pilots should have much harder logistical lives than everyone else.oh look, you had scorch l in your battleship? whooops, can't contract it to your carrier alt! oh look, you had in mf in your crusader? whoops, can't contract it to your carrier alt! oh look, your hauler had some ammo in it? whoops, can't contract it to your hauler alt. give me a ****ing break - my ""job"" in this isn't to point out and do all the design work for ccp.... my ""job"" in this thread is to point out an issue: you should be able to contract damaged items. if that means that there has to be some popup warning you about the items that are damaged or that there's some sort of column in the contract screen simply isn't my problem. ccp is more than capable of handling the particulars of fixing the problem.-liang"
3/2/2010,"yes, can be most annoying."
3/2/2010,this has needed a fix for so bloody long...
3/2/2010,"yeah, nothing more annoying than having a used set of crystals in the cargo of a amarr ship in 0.0, even more so if the said ship is in lost station, as you can't contract it without repackaging and destroying rigs to get rid of the damaged crystals. another option would be to have an option when creating the contract to remove the damaged items from the ship/container, be it crystals, drones or mods."
3/2/2010,i second this guy's idea.your contract for armageddon contains 1 unit of scorch l and 2 hammerhead i that has been damaged. this item has been removed to your hangar.
3/2/2010,"actually, local is very much an intel tool.in addition to sorting, an option to switch profile icon off should be added to reduce the vertical space taken by 50%."
3/2/2010,"as long as local exists, it should have a sensible interface. so sure, if ccp intends to remove local, or change it in some way, this wouldn't be needed- but as it stands, there's no reason that ccp should specifically avoid giving it a sensible interface. local as it stands is an intel tool- whether you like it or not. until that changes, this has my support."
3/2/2010,while this will not completely stop the hackers. it should dramatically decrease the number of cases and the severity of the loss.
3/2/2010,"added some more details to the original proposal.hope, this is still in time with regards to the next csm meeting."
3/2/2010,"abyss wyrm- i absolutely agree, i actually have sent them a letter, the quality of russian translation is absolutely terrible. i am a native speaking russian and i play the game in english. and imao we should translate the names of items for those that do not know english, but give original names in english in brackets. same probably should be applied to every language."
3/2/2010,"edit to support op.what would be nice is an interface that pops up when trying to create a new thread that is similar to the knowledge base, petition, or bug submission tool. it should force you to search for your topic prior to allowing you to post a new topic. then there would be about 10 threads started a day at best and those wouldn't be a continuous rehash of the same old beaten to death crap from every lazy noob to find the assembly hall."
3/2/2010,"rewritten post....i believe the problem people are having here is a problem with the agile scrum process itself.the system isn't perfect and there are trade-offs in any methodology. with re-balancing, finishing of existing expansions, and factionwar in general coming well behind 0.0 and bug chasing, and with no permanent ""product owner"" of factionwar the priorities combine to leave users of fw left out in the cold. without a scrum and to our best reckoning without any staff at all assigned.is it possible that each expansion needs it's own product owner that then stays with it and communicates with the public?it is meant to be user driven right?"
3/2/2010,ccp need to either fix fw or end it.it's as simple as that.
3/2/2010,decided to support this after all.
3/2/2010,"rentable event/ arena systemsthe ability to rent out a single dedicated system(s) for events with no security status (and thus no security standing loss for pvp events) with functions to restrict people able to enter depending on user preset choices and toggles (ie. their name, corp, ships type, and ship fittings, skill level, whether they've paid a fee, whether they've supplied an item etc.).this may sound like a lot of work, but the some of the mechanics are already ingame (think of acceleration gates and wormhole restrictions and the alliance tournament) . entrances to these areas would need to have multiple entrances and exits either using wormholes or multiple acceleration gates to enable different sec status'd pilots entry. other stuffnew prize contract systemsystem data exportcharge for the systems/ isk sinki've never play wow and i don't caremoar tournamentsif you've ever run a tournament, deathrace, mass melee or whatever with pilots from multiple alliances and corps you'll know how much of a headache it can be. having a system in place such as this could only enable moar fun. getting more than 10 people to flip cans is a logistical nightmare, even with veteran players.-t'amber"
3/2/2010,suppoarted.
3/2/2010,"i support this topic, but only because the op's english is win.-t'amber"
3/2/2010,"t, you dog you :p"
3/2/2010,supported
3/2/2010,arenas are dumb and go against eve ideology
3/2/2010,this.
3/2/2010,"not supported.i think things like this should be left in the hands of players. if you want an arena, claim a wormhole for a day, and bring enough back up to run an event. or do it with referee and can fishing in high-sec. same thing if you want to run races; set up a course with cans and have monitors and judges or whatever.the point is the mechanics exist that would allow players to mange this sort of thing for themselves already, and i think it ought to be left with them what to do with the sand-box."
3/2/2010,"now that poses are not longer used to determine sovereignty, it would be nice to allow players to maintain ownership of their pos if they change corps, rather than having to disassemble and then re-anchor it after joining the new corp.one possible option would be to allow the ""lauch for corp"" option to make the pos function as it currently does, and allow the ""launch for self"" option to allow the launching player to maintain ownership of the pos even if they change corps."
3/2/2010,no.players in npc corps do not need to be able to own pos facilities - this would render them untouchable even by wardec in high security space.
3/2/2010,hell no.pos's require a player owned corporation to be deployed.no exceptions.(no i don't give a crap what you said... i know what your going after and your not going to get it)
3/2/2010,this plus a bonus to the cpu usage of armor repair modules on ships that are meant to be active tanked would be great. currently these ships are inferior to buffer tanked ships for everything except mission running.
3/2/2010,yes please.
3/2/2010,/sign
3/2/2010,good idea
3/2/2010,well wormholes work at 5km so perhaps it's a non issue?/me hopes
3/2/2010,"i suggest making the distance be 5km, the same as the jump range for wormholes."
3/2/2010,good idea
3/2/2010,"as amusing as the bumping chain reactions are, it is unpleasant for the titan to get bumped and equally annoying to be bumped by the bumped titan (especially when it happens just before the bridge goes up). support for this."
3/2/2010,cannot allow to disapear
3/2/2010,"if it were an outright whine you'd have a point, but it isn't, so you don't."
3/2/2010,"i have over 400 kills in the last few months alone from a stealth bomber. i'm not bragging but i love covops ships. i love everything cloaky.that being said, your'e right. thousands say they're fine yet tens of thousands say they need a counter.nobody is looking to nerf cloaks. people just want those that are cloaking to remain active or be hunted.there's a huge difference."
3/2/2010,that's a nice summary indeed.
3/2/2010,"and that's what i'm opposed to. in deep space (deep 0.0 or w-space) the cloak is often the only ""dock"" available. pilots who fly far often don't have the luxury of being able to dock up when it's time to go make lunch or something.safe spot + cloak = explorers dock. i'm absolutely willing to accept afk cloakers to keep this functionality in the game. remember, one of the prime advantages of eve over other games for players with families/jobs/busy lives is the ability to walk away from the game and deal with life. cloaking up (just like docking) is a part of that."
3/2/2010,"ctrl-qwhen rl calls, log off.the cloak is not the game's ""please hold"" button."
3/2/2010,what 'buff'?i don't agree they need a nerf though.
3/2/2010,"do you know about the aggression mechanics?you can't simply ctrl-q if you have been in a fight within the last 15 mins because you will emergency warp and stay visible in space until the end of those 15 mins, during which time anyone fitted with a combat probes will find you and kill you.hardly fair.as to probing out ships, exclude covert ops cloaked ships and i might agree. the issue with being able to probe out covert ops is that it would make it far too safe to sit gangs at snipe spots on gates etc. how op is it to be able to ping a covert ops ship trying to get a drop on your gang. yes you can probe and warp a gang to result, but without a covert ops on grid getting the correct alignment to avoid bubbles etc you will fail hard.it is not a simple matter."
3/2/2010,"nope, never pvp'd in my life (well on this character it's true).but seriously, i know. my point was that the cloak isn't for that, otherwise every ship should have one. i mean, it's only far to have something to avoid the point of a gcc or agression timer.i agree completely."
3/2/2010,"did anyone not use pre-domi dd as a decloaking device? bomber campin' yo' outpost? warp titans on grid and double dd, cloaker wakes up in a pod. if a modified superweapon was given to titans (second module, but just like now cant fit both at once) for gridwide (and only gridwide), it would be fair. dominion got rid of the only truly viable decloaking mechanic.edit 1/1: yes this was done and yes it often killed friendlies"
3/2/2010,"in older dumps at least one could find ""decloaking devices"" that looked pretty similar to a traditional sb, but their description told the purpose of these modules would be to decloak ships within the range of these modules. i never saw them becoming 0'ed (state published), but as i started with cold war, these might have been in existance earlier.i'd prefer a combination of both ideas - (re-)introducing such decloaking modules (that would also decloak a covert cloaked ship) - maybe chance based - plus sized regular cloak modules that would allow to survive the agression time but not for hours of afk'ing (eating cap sounds nice to me).additionally, i never understood why cloaks are high slot modules. they don't require that much cap but loads of cpu instead. compared to other modules, i would have expected cloaaks to be mid-slot ones..."
3/2/2010,"its not a major problem but, it would be much easier if i could strip the modules from a ship that i am not on-board instead of swapping ships and waiting for session timer to finish just to change back. it would save time and annoyances of swapping to rigged ships just to remove the modules.i can see it being useful in getting the modules from a rigged ship that i can't fly. let say i get a rigged megathron from a contract coming equipped with armor repair modules and hardeners. problem is that i fly amarr ships and i can't fly a megathron for a while not to mention its rigged. therefore i can't get the modules off the ship that i want to use for my armageddon without repackaging the ships and destroying the rigs or waiting a for a while just to board the ship.basically all you would have to do is right click on the ship in your hangar and select the new option to ""strip modules from ship"". the modules would be removed from the ship and be put into your item hangar, allowing you to refit your current ship with the modules you need.i think this would save a lot of hassle for all eve players."
3/2/2010,and of course i support my idea
3/2/2010,"there is a way to do this (repackage a fitted ship), but it also means losing any rigs or insurance it has. not a bad idea tbh"
3/2/2010,"why not take this a step further and allow us to refit ships while not being in the ship as well, but regardless supported!"
3/2/2010,supported
3/2/2010,"yeah, i wouldn't mind having this."
3/2/2010,supported on low priority. to me it'd be a matter of convenience - scotty is annoying enough ;)
3/2/2010,the best reasoning i've seen - by order of the sheeple!!!plus we could spend hours pointlessly tweaking our color schemes when we're too chikken to leave our comfy zones in hi-sec stations!!!but excellent reasoning with a hint of sage!
3/2/2010,"although not an original thread, the 4th rig idea is and i like (excpt the bonuses).most of the lahg created from something like this would be client side so if you or your pc counldn't handle the lahg you could always turn it off .. and to lower the chances of coming across a whole fleet of custom colours you could make them bloody expensive to buy so that only the elite could afford them -t'amber"
3/2/2010,"i can actually recall a couple mmo's that failed, in part because everyone looked pretty much the same...it's kinda boring to go out in a fleet and see 50+ frigates, all alike (sue me, i used to be in eve uni)it would be kinda interesting to have simple decals too...in a fleet - all dd=red, ecm=blue, tackle=greensl's have 1 stripewc's have 2 stripesfc's are white with 3 stripes(actually, your uuber tank is white, the real fc is in an inconspicuous black-as-night shuttle.....)"
3/2/2010,thread cleaned up a bit.
3/2/2010,good idea
3/2/2010,supported
3/2/2010,"lag? i don't give a $%&* for large fleet combat, it really sucks.this idea rocks."
3/2/2010,"what about creating ""launch drone group x"" shortcuts? that way, you define your groups the way you want and bind the launching of those groups separately. there would need to be a way to assign your groups to one of idk, five, group numbers so they could be bound. it wouldn't be perfect, but it would be better than being forced to use the drone window."
3/2/2010,my domi got different sets than my raven or my sacri.
3/2/2010,"yeah i thought about that too. lets say that instead of having arbitrary groups, we have a set number, like 5 or 10, and make binds for those. maybe drone groups could be saved with a fitting, so that you could have different groups for each ship, but the binds would still work. then its to the pilot to make sure that their group 1 drones are all combat, group 2 are all ecm, etc... again, not perfect, but better than nothing."
3/2/2010,keep in mind that ccp did not mention anywhere that they made this change to reduce lag - or if the change even affects lag at all.
3/2/2010,"problemthe prices of mins are heavily influenced by mission runners, so that mining ist going to be nonsense for the relation of isk per hour. proposalremove reprocessing or nerv reprocessing so that the total output of minerals from mission runners is lower then 10% of the total marked."
3/2/2010,*gives said poster the idiot of the day award*if your going to request removal of reprocessing... then i request that anyone who attacks anyone in high sec without war-dec be forced to buy there ships and products in low sec.it's only fair : o pand if you believe that.. i got a bridge for sale.
3/2/2010,reprocessing is ok... i believe the problem might be that huge amount of tech 1 loot from those missions.
3/2/2010,"yes, but if you remove most parts of the t1 loot, then the t2 prices will be going exponentially upwards."
3/2/2010,"how <U+FFFD>bout make it cost money to reprocesses instead. how much sense does it make that a station will break down module into its component parts, strip the unsalvageable material away and then melt or process the rest into base materials (which one assumes must cost something) all for basically free ( i believe they tax some materials but that<U+FFFD>s kind of dumb and it's really minor in comparison).anyways, nerfing the reprocessing amount, or nerfing the drop rate, is a band aid solution at best, ubalancing at worst, and ultimately pointless. it's a problem that needs to be approached with far more care then just, ""omg, eww! hit with a hammer and burn it in holy fire.""not supported."
3/2/2010,yes lets get everyone to raise the prices of goods to make up for the cost of reprocessing... real smart.... reaaaaly smart.
3/2/2010,i wish i could remove your posting
3/2/2010,"right 'cuase i was really trying to fix the whole problem with one line rather then just tossing in an idea. perhaps you missed the part where i said that the problem requires a little more care and thought then that? maybe you should take the sunglasses off next time?it would also lead to an increase in the price of minerals too, making it good for miners. you might note that the stuff bought for reprocessing schemes would have to raise their prices but that the modules actually used by players would remain only marginally affected because the price for them is set by drop rate and demand. but then again your one line argument is fairly pointless so theres not much point in going into it."

3/2/2010,your actually falling for this tripe hersch? o.o;;;surely you jest.i remember my maelstrom's tank improving as i trained up tsm... tsm helps... i don't get where peopel are getting the idea it hurts.and who the hell gives a crap at 25% shields... if your shield tanking its a waste of time to fret as your likely dead anyway.armor tankers? whoop ti doo... your an armor tanker..who cares about shields?!
3/2/2010,"please, continue to argue that taking armour/structure damage improves your tanking ability. in fact, i recommend that all you shield tankers leave it at level 1"
3/2/2010,you mean 4. ;)we love our invul ii :p
3/2/2010,5 even! 8o)
3/2/2010,after warhead upgrades 5 is done.
3/2/2010,"well it sounds plausible that if instead of your shields taking damage, your armour does, in that way not lowering your shield and keeping your recharge up."
3/2/2010,"change it to cpu reduction for shield modules, even if only for hardeners or boosters/boost amps"
3/2/2010,"scimis rep my hac's shield even at 15%, no reason to require for it to add armor rep or hull rep to keep me alive.not supported."
3/2/2010,right now the only useful application of this skill is a prerequisite for shield hardeners. the skill's bonus is pointless because by the time your shields are under 25% your tank is broken. (active tanks could make it)i like the idea of it increasing the max recharge window.
3/2/2010,"that is exactly the point, it does not make any difference. wether the skill hurts your ship or actually improve it, does not matter, difference is probably so minisque it is not noticeable, which is not right as it should be making a difference, so let's make it usefull. the fact is armor tanker does not give a crap about shields, and for shield tanker, if you are below 20% shield you're are probably already dead. it woun't make more then half a percent difference."
3/2/2010,re-read what the skill book says...you people are making me shake my head... is this really our generation? people who make assumptions and conclude before thinking things through?yes... it might be a bit weak for a skill that doesn't achieve much... guess what... there are tons that do that.but its not useless... that's for sure.i'm done with this farce of a thread... oey... do what you will... buff it.. but don't bloody nerf it.
3/2/2010,"i think it is sort of silly for it to be at 25% and below. i mean, at that point, a shield tank is dead anyway. either you've capped out or you can't active tank to keep up or your passive tank just failed. anyway you look at it, if your shield tank has fallen to under 25% shields, you're going to die in the next few seconds.so, i would suggest making the magic number start at 40-50% or something. unless there was some other boost to shield tanking the came along with it, it would just become a required skill in a different way.i will support that there has to be a better use for the skill though. but the op's suggestion is fairly crazy. i have max shield skills and have enjoyed the wonder than is a passive tank. throwing a 50% recharge bonus (as suggested by the op) would make heavy passive shield tanks truly invincible rather than just a hard tank to break. vultures roll with around 600-700 hp/s at peak recharge (677 hp/s for mine). the op's suggestion would bring that to over 1000 hp/s. as amusing as that might be, it would also be horribly unbalanced."
3/2/2010,the 25% are well worth it.a friend of mine got below 20% in his drake and could happily continue tanking with keeping range. and he didnt get armor dmg thanks to the skill.

(even if its not needing to be drawn... the calculations invovled in 3d space are likely going to cause a migraine. who would thunk it? a miss harder to calculate than a hit? x o ) chaos theory anyone?)honestly... i really fail to see the importance... yes its cool... yes it would make things nice.but i can think of about 100 other items far more earth shattering then this.i'd sooner ask ccp to fix open shelled errors on various ships such as the maelstrom and the typhoon and others.like thats gonna happen.so yes... you may resume your emo-rant at-will...lota good it will do"

3/2/2010,"players can thru sisi testing and feedback threads, the csm is just another layer in that system.a lot can change in one year, let alone 2, and if a candidate gets elected more than twice in a row, it would be unlikely to be because of a powerblock and more likely to be simply because he was a competent representative.we discussed this at length and its difficult to come up with solutions there, as its simply human nature to clutter up in groups rather than fight outnumbered. game mechanics like treaties could however support a more dynamic system.they can't anyway, firing dd interrupts warp and disallows it for 30sno. we're not all that stupid. (to get caught ;))the point is that that may be achieved while causing less grief to players, with a lower timer. there is nothing magical about 5 minutes that scares of spammers, 1-2 mins might well have the exact same effects."
3/2/2010,"excellent. hybrids need some love. not a huge boost, just a little tweaking so blasters can more reliably engage in their size class, and rails can more usefully leverage their range."
3/2/2010,"yeah i wasn't really happy how this was worded in the minutes, it happened as td said."
3/2/2010,"sorry if i am not jumping for joy over treaties as a solution to power block issue in 0.0. i remember before dominion was released being excited about the idea of power blocks being done for and there be massive battles all over 0.0 that were not the whole ""ultra mega team a vs. ultra mega team b"" and those two teams being the only teams in 0.0what did we get? same damn thing if not worse. csm was heavily involved in dominion too as was totted by both csm and ccp. is this the part where we get to thank csm for dominion?the only time one of these power blocks goes down is when someone pulls the plug, and they are just replaced by yet another power block.so good luck with your treaties as a solution. looks like you will have plenty of time do work on that now totalitarian sokratesz./me salutes"
3/2/2010,"the third csm pointed out some very clear things to ccp regarding what they wanted to see in domionion. the fact that many of the features intended to address their concerns never made it into the release was one of if not the most hot button issue of the weekend. treaties were identified as probably the most meaningful, widesweeping change that would actually do most of what dominion was supposed to do. but as the minutes mention, other things were discussed such as the size of ihubs, access points to 0.0, the presence of undersized rats in 0.0, and a reduction/increase in station services hp/resists with the aim at making them more attackable and repairable by small groups."
3/2/2010,as a mission runner the only thing that will get me to .0 is missions and i was hoping the new infrastructure upgrades would allow a mission mechanic to be developed there.null sec ratting just doesn't interest me at all but being able to do what i like and support a .0 alliance would have me down there before the end of the week. if my corp wouldn't sign a treaty to get access then i wouldn't be in my corp much longer. i imagine a lot of mission runners would go as well but as it sits now we either get ganked in low sec trying or stay in high sec.one can hope for changes in the future.
3/2/2010,"i must say i'm rather happy with the summit's results, although there where some things i disagree with, there where major strides made in terms of csm's political 'weight' and ccp and csm communication back and forth and to the playerbase. that's something i've been hoping to see."
3/2/2010,and what did you discuss that would allow alliances to realistically go into 0.0 and claim sov without having to blue one of the power blocks?
3/2/2010,"you need to vote someone into the csm that thinks about these things. right now, unless your part of one of the major power blocks, your voice will never be heard. better luck next time."
3/2/2010,"not everyone on the csm is from a major power bloc, in fact i think when the voting ended only four of the nine full councillors were. since then goons have fallen whilst another csm member has put an alt into a sov holding alliance.you would have a point if you were talking about pvp vs carebear but the bogeyman large power bloc taking over the csm claims are a bit overblown."
3/2/2010,you enjoy your 'treaties' feature that is nothing more than a tool to manage pets and does jack for opening the door for alliances to be part of 0.0 without being part of a power block.
3/2/2010,"yes, a lot can change in a year (note that the second term will start after 1 year, not 2). that is exactly why it is not a good idea to have you pople locked in the seat for a year.having no industrial representative for 6 month is bad for, lacking it for a year is several order of magnitude worse. having a bunch of people that say: ""it is not in my election program, i don't care for this stuff"" don't get me full of hope for the future months, even less if you guys get a change in rules for this csm and get to stay for a year. so far i have seen 2 threads about industrial stuff by csm members and it was pretty evident they don't know how the industrial part of eve work.gems like this one: ""moving datacore production to nullsec was identified as a possible means to give players incentives to operate there."" show that you guys have no idea of the effects of a change like this would have on invention. tossing a suggestion like that in the middle of the meeting without any discussion in the assembly hall, the market forum or the science and industry forum show a total disregard for the opinions of the players and a lack of comprehension of the probable consequences."
3/2/2010,"that was not ours, that was ccp's, and they had put quite a bit of thought in it.and if you want more industrial reps on the csm, run yourself and mobilise your peers?"
3/2/2010,"i read the meeting minutes from iceland and found this statement:""the csm would not like to see very large fleet fights discouraged through game design""but you acknowledge and experience all day the lag that affects those large fleet engagements. i see a bit of contraddiction between these two things.obvious thingswhile it is right that when people learn about eve they are usually very impressed by the size of engagements, it's true as well that many of us were disappointed when we doscovered how bad our game experience can be made because of ""lag"" (and connected issue such as grid loading issues, desync and so on). but it's obvious that, if you and ccp don't put in place a gameplay mechanic that encourages smaller fights over bigger ones, people will always pack themselves in the smallest area possible. why?i think you know that focus fire is the best tactic to use in eve. everybody uses it when they call primaries. it gives you the fastest way to kill enemy forces, and thus to take out enemy dps. this is the mother of all the issues with server performance. if you improve server performance, you just push forward the soft limit on local population that is posed by lag. that is, this limit will be always reached, and we will always have lagged fights, just more bigger ones, that is more epic ones.so, if you don't put in place a gameplay mechanic that help the server in splitting the load of a fight on different another statement of yours (actually the completion of the phrase above)""...but feels there is a need for a fair distribution of lag caused by grids not loading.""personally, i don't like it. i don't want lag at all. but i want epic fights ad you.my considerationshow many people must be in a fight for it to be considered ""epic""? 500 people are enough?and do you think they must be in the same system?if your answers to the two question above were both ""yes"", you will never have lagless engagements with current server tecnology. but think of how many 500 ships are. with all their drones. i bet you cannot distinguish between 500 and 5000 if you are between them. i have been on many demonstrations, and i can guarantee you that wheter you are between 500 or 5000 people you cannot tell the difference. that is to say that the ""epicness"" of a fight will not be ruined if a fight ""only"" of 500 ships, while server performance will.so i ask you. why don't you encourage ccp to create a conquest mechanic that encourages people to split their forces on many solarsistem?this will solve lag in fleet fights once for all.if you don't discourage bigger ""monolithic"" fights, lag will always be back. these are my thoughts. please tell me if and why you disagree."

3/3/2010,"i like the concept of ""attrition warfare"" but this really doesn't support ""small gang warfare"" so much as 'gank the carebears.""edit: unless people actually ""defend"" their carebears...or the bears reship and fight the insurgents...idea has potential"
3/3/2010,"yeah the implicit idea was that the alliance would have to protect its industrialists to keep their high indices. a ""they can defend themselves"" stance wouldn't be positive for them as it directly influences the security of the system if all the industrialists just pack up and leave for a safer area."
3/3/2010,sounds like a good idea.

3/3/2010,"the ones worth deccing are the 8 month to 1.5 year people who think they know how to pvp and fly really nice ships. or deccing a 300 man alliance that has a nice pos and wont come to defend it.deccing people who can only fly frigates and cruisers is just a waste of ammo. still, war decs are fine the way they are."
3/3/2010,"argumentum ad populum.industrialist corps do war dec competitors. industrialist corps do put contracts out on competitors. when an industrial corp gets large enough (requiring the ability to stave off attacks from competitors and high sec pvp corps), they attract the attention of alliances.what you fail to realize is the biggest industrial corps are in null sec alliances. where do you think they get all the minerals to build outposts, titans, super caps, and replace all those capital ships they lose? they don't buy them from dinky high sec industrial corps, that's for sure.short of a few months (when i joined two consecutive pirate corps after getting my first industrial corp bulldozed), i've been in industrial corps the entire 4 years i've played eve.the current corp cranks out a few dozen bss/bcs a day and caps are built on a regular basis. why can we do this? we also have a group of rabid pvpers in the corp who keep systems we mine clear, and keep our freighters safe.as to ganking freighters (straw man argument)... i was showing you why pvp corps would attack an industrial corp without a contract from another industrial... when you kill a loaded freighter, you pull in a mountain of isk. you can make money with pvp. that is the point.and i do know how much it takes to gank a freighter in high sec. the last time i was in on one, we attacked it with 19 bss (tier 1-2). fully fit, each lost somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-30m each from the difference between insurance payout and fittings. each person received about 110m isk from the loot that was dropped and sold. that is a healthy profit for a few hours of grinding sec status and about an hour spent hunting a worthwhile target (not including the income from grinding sec status). belts are less static than they used to be. as are plexes. you really don't have the systems that are end-all-be-all sources for industrialists. as such, a high sec industrialist corp should easily be able to pick up and move where the war dec becomes pointless. you have 24 hours notice for crying out loud.i will ignore your ad hominem arguments."
3/3/2010,"invention was the fix to the t2 bpo problem, and its heavily impacted the profitability of most of the old ""big profit bpos"", it also killed a significant portion of the cartels that used to exist.(remember 10mill+ cap recharger 2s anyone?)t2 bpos are not anywhere near as damaging as they sued to be now that anyone and everyone can invent, and the sheer number of r+d jobs going on in empire is an indication that a lot of people are either inventing or getting ready to.in short, the situation isn't broken. so no fix is really needed."
3/3/2010,yes they should of been removed when they stopped the lotterly this clearly gives older players a huge advantage over other players. only the people reaping the benefits of this will not support it...
3/3/2010,half the people i know with t2 bpos are about as old as me (2 years playing) and bought their bpos after farming lots and lots of iskthis sort of assumption makes you look stupid. i and many others do not have any t2 bpos (nor have i partook in invention for quite some time) and i still think removing these items is stupid.

3/3/2010,"people often cite this post: as a reason to change/remove meta 0 modules drop rate in missions (and some of them whant them removed from belt rats too).if you look closely to the data you will notice that loot include morphite (so the loot table include t2 items). it include reprocessed ships and compression modules too. so the data were heavily contaminated even then. now time as passed and we had wormholes, unholy rage, the velspater buff and the 0.0 upgrades.there are plenty of discussions in the market forum and the science and industry forum about the value of minerals and turning them to isk by self destructing ship that we have just produced and mission running and ratting are often indicated as the culprit of the low value of minerals. it can be true or the problem can be another, so i vould like to see ccp give some up to date information. something like:1) a table like the one above for a recent period, one cleared of spurious data as much as possible;2) how much minerals are mined in high sec/low sec/0.0/wh or at least the different percentages if ccp feel that knowing the actual quantities could affect the markets. 3) some data about the number of ships self destructing to collect insurance. i think all those data are needed if we want to help ccp analyze the problem and i really hope ccp has them as they need them to see what is happening in eve."

3/3/2010,"as it stands, damage controls take one unit of capacitor every thirty seconds. this means that even if one is neuted dry, one is likely to still have enough passive regen to run the dc. as such there's no real point having it an active module, as it can't be overloaded, either. so, i propose that damage controls become a passive mod, which might even have the salutary effect of reducing lag."
3/3/2010,i'm down. though may change game play for those passive tanked drakes sporting the damage controls *snicker*
3/3/2010,"i don't see why not.also, in before the elite pvp'ers who think it takes a **** ton of skill to press one button before you engage the enemy."
3/3/2010,i don't see why or why not.all of this over 1 unit of cap?nah... not worth the time investment.and there is likely a reason for it.
3/3/2010,afk hull tank travel fits ftw jk
3/3/2010,i like it.
3/3/2010,not supported for this reason.
3/3/2010,you just killed the proposal. congratulation.not supported for exactly that reason.
3/3/2010,"because if you go afk your armor tank spontaneously combusts? what about shield tanks? i mean, sure, why not."
3/3/2010,not supported. if it was a passive module it's resistances would be increased by the shield/armor hardening skills.
3/3/2010,it isn't done for technical reasons if i recall. something to do with how stacking penalties are applied.plus i won't get a laugh when someone i know loses a fight because they forget to flick it on!
3/3/2010,"because making it an exclusion just isn't possible, right?"
3/3/2010,so what you are saying is you have no idea what goes into programming those bonus's into the game and how much server load it would cause? name one system in that game that is excluded by a skill it would otherwise be directly effected by?goodluck.
3/3/2010,"people die every day because they mis-click or forget to click it after a jump. if it was made passive then we might as well remove a lowslot from all ships and increase all resistances appropriately.increase cap drain by a lot, allow it to be overheated and increase benefits (like a perpetual creeping repair of hull) of it while applying stacking which is currently not the case."
3/3/2010,"nobecause making damage controls a separate group is not possible either, right? you do realise that shield resistance amplifiers are not affected by this skill, because they are a different mod. group. no, making damage control excluded from effect of a singe skill woun't sky-rocket cpu usage and crash the server."
3/3/2010,a) i never said it would crash the server only increase load by creating it's own special group. everytime anything new is added it increases load and this change is so tiny and pointless is it worth added load? dramatize much?b) passive shield hardeners are affected by shield compensation skills by 5% per level and active hardeners are also affected when they are not online by 3% per level. the same goes for armor compensation skills.
3/3/2010,"from some old dev and players comments it apparently was meant to be a passive module but there were programming problems (i vaguely recall something about it being stackable if passive, but i can be wrong). a suggestion like this was made a couple of year ago and a dev stated i the thread that the programming hurdle had been resolved to introduce some other module. so apparently the use of energy to use the damage control is only a legacy thing, something left over from old problems. note that the dc is in a category of its own as it is not stacking nerfed and stack with other modules but don't stack with other dc. so, even if it is not something critical, supported."
3/3/2010,it's stacking nerfs are applied to it's resistance bonus's when i use it so i am not sure what you are talking about there. though you may be right that it's already in a catagory of it's own since when it isn't on it doesn't seem to get any bonus from the compensation skills.still stupidly small but saves one click here and there so why not.
3/3/2010,"you running missions increases load on the node, you should stop doing that. no by the armor skills, what you where trying to argue, which means they are in a different group, which means that creating groups isn't a problem when we whant to, which renders your whole talk about extra server load irrelevant. [quoteyou ]have no idea...how much server load it would cause?as neihter you nor me know wether it is in a group of it's own at the moment, arguing about it is pointless. as less click=> less server requests => sell lag, that benefit would heavylly outweight any load that could appear for extra one database entry. please, can we stop commenting on how much lag it would cause, as only ccp knows (and in some cases even they don't) how much lag certain features mean? especially if you are far from being an expert in that area? and damage controls do not suffer from any sort of stacking penalties, by the way."

3/3/2010,"/signedgreat idea, can be nice to ransom pods at a good price instead of not really knowing :)you got my vote :)"
3/3/2010,"ccp, please allow to build on planets in wh.atm, the ihubs give a boost to 0.0 space, but no to wh. in wh there is no moonmining.so please give the wh citizens the possibilty to build on planets.thanks"
3/3/2010,no...there is a reason that is not allowed.and i suspect such things would require an ihub as that's the reason they where made.
3/3/2010,"same reason as for no wh sovereignty. impossible to bring enough fire-power in to contest/destroy such structures.perhaps some super fragile versions that do not require hubs, but then any roamer with a gun can set you back weeks/months and that no fun either.you chose to live in the wilderness, you choes to live without running water"
3/3/2010,well i have a nice waterplanet ? so why i cant use the resource ? and now lets talk not about game mechanics.
3/3/2010,"i have just a idea, ok, if it is planned from ccp, that wh citizens cannot build on planets, why not include a ship, wich can go to the orbit and harvest some resources from the planet ? like a rorqual or something like that."
3/3/2010,"what part of ""ccp says no"" do you people not understand?can't read english?"
3/3/2010,"actually drake, according to the devblog, we will be able to interact with all planets. whether that really means all remains to be seen on sisi i suppose."
3/3/2010,yeah... all planets in known space... whs isn't included in that to be sure due to the obvious 0.0 implications.otherwise its obvious that they will have to open up moon mining and a plethora of other things in whs... and that is a can of worms in itself.
3/3/2010,no you just dont understand actually we had 2 tower in wh of which the distance was only 10ly which is jumpable easly enough but it seems you cna light cyno but just cant jump and about those station we could have them but you could always get but the wh system a cyno to be link and then you can jump a whole fleet with a titan or a cyno a hotdrop on a wh and you get to the next one thats it try to be optimiste and not pessimiste
3/3/2010,"i think this quote applies to your question, ccp whisper - therefore the answer is no.brechan"
3/3/2010,"no, no, and a thrice time nono hot dropping titans into a wh.... simple as that, it's what makes them unique is that excact ability for only the owners of said hole to have capital capabillities, so stop being so damn lazy and get an assembly array in there like the rest of us"
3/3/2010,no you reaslly dont understand what wh space is... if you lived there for since it first started then you would know that some the stuf ccp made is great but why you think they keep improving stuff it is because it need to be improved to suit better what it is employed for and if people stop thinking of only 0.0 and 0.0 and 0.0 you would stop having a narrow vision of what is wh and then you would see other stuff than 0.0
3/3/2010,listen well and clear kiddo... i lived in wormhole space... long enough to know that what your asking for would be great and all but it would screw the balance so far out of wack that it would be a living nightmare.in whs we have a level playing field... there are rules and guidelines even super alliances are forced to comply with... by changing those rules you lose your advantage.and as ive said already... ccp says no... therefore the answer is no.quit while your ahead before you embarrass yourself.ps: the only reason i stopped is i found that 0.0 was more profitable and easier to cope with in spite of the dangers of hot drops and other 0.0esqe things.
3/3/2010,"i expect if you keep ignoring what we're saying and repeating that we don't understand, we'll probably start supporting your thread."
3/3/2010,i don't understand.
3/3/2010,"as a long time wh dweller i don't want/need jump bridges or cynos. i don't want/need the subspace beacons and data network. the lack of these are what makes wh space different.however, there is a pos mod that requires system sov that does not make any sense to me. i can build all the carriers, dreads and rorquals that i want but i can't on-line a capital ship maintenance array to hold them. what is so special about this mod that it can't be on-line in wh space? isn't it just a big hanger? even in 0.0 why does this mod require sov? what am i missing?"
3/3/2010,that's a rational question/request to be sure.the other complaint is the weakness of reprocessing arrays...personally id rather see the damn timer go away and leave them at the weak processing power they have now to make up for the timing.
3/3/2010,"wh sovereignty was intentionally left out since it was and still is impossible to contest. there is no way to bring needed fire-power in.what do you want it for anyway? jumpranges to/from wh are too long and cynos don't work there as far as i know .. something to do with concord beacons or some such. come up with some ideas as to how to expand on pos structures or mobile base-ship type things instead, the audience is far larger down that route"
3/3/2010,"let's say that its modified so you can have sov in wh, mine moongoo (and all other things that require sov) and put jump bridge there... time three months they would be all taken by the big megaalliances.do you really want to lose your wh?"
3/3/2010,"the only sov like feature i could see wanting in wh space would be the ability to set up market hubs of some type. i could see this simplifying logistics in a way ccp would not like though.personally i rather like the idea of setting up a 'oh, you screwed up and ran out of probes, missiles or space to drop your loot? stop by one of my convenient market hubs where i will charge exorbitant prices for common goods!'"
3/3/2010,"so yeah... i'm just getting to the point where i can afford to use these nice little toys and i see they don't behave like i would expect them to behave when it comes to crystals.mining crystals eventually expire and shut down... and auto-reload a new crystal in its place.i assumed that the same would be the case for a rack of beam/pulse cannons.granted maybe having them in group mode is not helping either but i was willing to accept the entire rack going off line to reload one crystal and then start firing them again.but instead the whole damn thing shuts down and you can't resume firing because of one cannon not loaded with a crystal in a group.instead of breaking them out of the group i would have to cycle crystals out to a different group then cycle back.for those who don't know how potentially painful that is... switching from gleam to aurora is a bit hazardous. :)solution - when a crystal ""shatters"" have the reload mech. grab a spare crystal from the cargo bay and allow the pilot to start firing away without cycling out and or breaking the group up.pros - less frustration and shouldn't effect balance. and allows group firing pew pew sweet action.cons - your frakked if you don't have a spare."
3/3/2010,bekase improving gameplay is not what ccp pays attention to.
3/3/2010,"proposing the idea of selling multiple goods via shift click, and having the option to sell each good individually without having to create a contract, or right click and sell item on multiple goods. for instance, i have 150 things in my items, i can select all goods, right click, and select (sell all goods)...and i can sell them according to buyers on the market, rather then having to right click and sell all 150 things (or make a contract)"
3/3/2010,very much it would be desirable to know that my enemy has wasted while i pod him.
3/3/2010,"so anyone who doesn't support changing the hype basically says ""go away and roll an amarr character""how about you just stop posting and try to find a reasonable way to fix this ship?i don't feel altering the slot layout is such a good plan, but i do think the hyperion badly needs fixing. i think those fixes are more likely to come from gameplay mechanic changes (blaster tracking, something to make active armor tanking less crap) than altering the ship itself though.it is, however, a shining example of how ineffective the whole gallente 'design philosophy' is - whichever moron thought that active tank+mwd+short range, bad tracking, high damage guns was a good idea should be outside washing car windows."
3/3/2010,"*sighs* k you guys are making this far too complicated, will support when you change to this --> make new tabs, for launchable drones (just like folders you can already make) i have mine setup as hammers, hobs, heavys, reppers, shields, and ecm exactly like that. have ccp implement launch group alpha (or a or one idc) then put drones in these folders and have hotkeys for these premade folders. put whatever drones you plan on useing in these folders. problem solved"
3/3/2010,"supported, with the ability to add shortcut keys to certain drone groups. as an ishkur pilot, it's very annoying to have to quit manually flying so that i can recall my warriors and launch my ecm drones.maybe one could right click a drone group in-flight and select an option that says ""assign shortcut"" or something like that."
3/3/2010,+1 with a catch. right now you only can put a drone in one of your groups so if you want to adapt to your enemy and want to launch eg. 2 light 1 med and 2 ecm drones you have to manually select them and launch. there should be an extra tab in drone interf

3/3/2010,you posted the exact same topic back on 02/22/2010. youa re either an idiot or a troll.please stop.
3/3/2010,i don't see how people are getting these things stolen. whenever i ran missions in the past the objective item was always in my cargo within a couple of seconds.

3/3/2010,supported
3/3/2010,"supported. without this it'll be impossible to have naps without granting, say, docking rights. i don't like non-aggression pact frenzy, but players should have the choice to let people pass through their territory without giving them docking rights."
3/3/2010,forgot to support!
3/3/2010,"raising issues/proposals on topics that are still being worked on is rather pointless.add your concerns in the relevant thread and suggest alternatives. the devblog was a courtesy-call by ccp to give us a chance to influence the outcome and help with the revamp, not a set-in-stone type of thing.not supporting. objection to issue that does not yet exist."
3/3/2010,"not supported.only on the basis on why would you want to make things more detailed standings wise? is silly at the moment.most people set at -10,-5,0,+5,+10 very rarely even in 0.0 alliances anything in between is used and this is shown graphically in the new ui which i think is the step in the right direction.to be honest im not sure why we even need 5 options. your either a friendly, a neutral or an enemy there really is no in between, and to be honest when it comes to it the only things your hear is - are they blue, are they red, are they neut that is it..ok perhaps theres the pos/station access point but what else?i mean please explain why you would even want more detailed standings"
3/3/2010,"we dont want more detailed standings - we just want the same ones we have now. station access, fleet access and service tax all tie into standings, and as such, more standings than just 10, 5, -5 and -10 are used. you may not need them, but many others do.as for bringing up a proposal to a 'future issue': it is easier to get ccp to change their mind now and not implement a bad change than it is to let them implement a bad change and then get them to change it back. i was a csm member for two terms and know that just because something is 'in the backlog' it does not mean it will get done any time soon. getting the point accross through the csm as well as the comments thread will show ccp how important it is that they do not screw this up."
3/3/2010,"dont toss ideas around me.. i tend to tear im up like a rabbid dog. :)i don't got a problem with selling high and buying low... but then you get these asshats who suicide gank in the name of a perverse ideology of ""helping the economy"" out.either way... no foul no harm done. just don't touch reprocessing. : o p"
3/3/2010,agreed. i tend to think that the problem is more based on the mining/industry side then it is the missioning side in any case.
3/3/2010,"1) buy a new airbus.2) put it in a furnace.3) collect reclaimed metals.4) sell the raw materials for more then the plane, the labour, the processes, the costs.i know that in rare situations this is a reality..... but....eve sets it up as a ""game"", the amount reclaimed is deliberately high to create a ""reprocessor"" career path.ignore that it ruins the market often and is completely ridiculous.if it's going to be a career path then at least make it something that can't be done on a low sp alt."
3/3/2010,"eve is a sandbox played by many that have the claim the economy has to be more than the one in wow. i know the whining will be earth shaking if ccp nerfs refining, but the game mechanics for economics are now horrible. the low price level is not caused by competition of miners on the market."
3/3/2010,"explain why:- the price of high end minerals only plunged after ccp introduced unlimited high ends in wormhole space and any 0.0- the price of veld only plunged after ccp introduced the new veld roids in highsec- the price of minerals was fairly stable for years - with mission runners collecting loots- the magical 46% of minerals post has morphite in the reprocessed column. oh wait ccp specifically said it was for all modules - even those used for mineral compression.yeah, you want to know why the mineral market is ****ed up? because of you. stop mining.-liang"
3/3/2010,"op is attacking the problem from the wrong end. fix the minerals available from rat loot, not the ability to reprocess."
3/3/2010,what the hell.
3/3/2010,"i would suggest that rats only drops meta 2 and higher items that can't be produced in other ways. that way it wouldn't interfere with the normal mineral market due to these modules being so valuable ""unreprocessed"".but this would probably just crash the higher meta market instead"
3/3/2010,"nope, people will just start building them. the cost of the t1 originals compared to final t2 product cost is minimal."
3/3/2010,not if the drop rate forthe meta 2 items and above remaind the same.
3/3/2010,"true, but that would have to mean that all meta 1 items are removed from the loot tables, with no other changes. this in turn means less overall income for the mission runners, which would make them go berserk."
3/3/2010,"too many miners --> too much minerals supply , demand is more like is the same---> prices drop. thats all, if you want higher prices there should be less miners or more buyers."
3/3/2010,"problems are:abundance of bpsabundance of farmersabundance of hisec minerstoo much morphitetoo many loot dropstoo much iskinsurance is static and needs to be dynamicetc, etc."
3/3/2010,"if you remove reprocessing you can't get minerals from your ore either.also, if you seriously believe that mission runners are getting better mineral hauls from running their missions than you are mining....then durrr, run missions instead of mining and get the benefit yourself - it's still locking objects up, pressing buttons, and moving items into your hold at the end of the day."
3/3/2010,"you must prove the problem is real. so far we have a old post from a dev saying that in the period between mid august and mid september 2008 the reprocessing of modules (and ships, and t2 stuff and compression items) was producing approximately 40% of the minerals. to be specific the number were:tritanium: 43%pyerite: 68%mexallon: 59%isogen: 56%nocxium: 32%zydrine: 18%megacyte: 39%morphite: 1% i would add that in that timeframe i had a friend buying as many eos as possible from the market and reprocessing them to sell the components for a gain. after that we had wormholes, unholy rage, the velspater buff and the 0.0 upgrades. i doubt those data have any value today. if you can get ccp to release more up to date informations and possibly clear them of spurious data (removing at least reprocessed t2, ships and capital items from the total) we will have a better idea of where the problem lie and what could be done."
3/3/2010,"remove base t1 loot, replace meta drops with 'wrecked modules' that function as bpcs.?"
3/3/2010,"i believe this message sums up my stance on this issue:""a sammich without bread isn't a sammichit's meat with mustard on your hands!""yes, we'd all prefer some sort of system where players smuggled stuff from players to other players, and are pulled over by a third set of players for naughtiness. but that isn't going to happen because the vast majority of players just can't be bothered to give a pair of numby nuts about what other players have in their holds. the booster system was intended to be all ""yay smuggling"" but guess how well that went nowhere. exceedingly well! demand for boosters is near nil outside of the pvp community, and to be quite honest the people who have the most need for them tend not to hang out in hisec where the smuggling would happen!so using npcs to drive smuggling, but providing all the real rewards and supply through players while acting as a net isk sink works to the benefit of all humanity in at least eleventy billion ways. plus, hey-o, smuggling. in conclusion i demand that all and sundry support the peter potamus home for hot unwed mothers by approving this proposal. failure to do so will result in something quite unpleasant -- in your pants!-harvey birdman, attorney at law!"
3/3/2010,"supported in princaple, i belive that this would be a valuble step to incressing the intrests and profitability of low sec, i would also add that there should be a small bounty placed on the smugglers when they are flaged by customs for the duration of there contract encouraging pvp. do you take a small ship and skip through the gates fast only to instapop... or somethign hevey with an increased chance of the faction police ariving and proceeding to chew on your behind.small issue with the stealthy ships making these sorts of runs relitivly easy though - blockade runner springs to mind."
3/3/2010,"as the certain super sexy winged man in question, i feel that this line adequately addresses your complaint vis a vis cloak wtfpwnzing customs agents.i'd honestly prefer that carrying contraband through a gate instantly trigger the faction police whaaambulance, regardless of cloak status. imagine how hilarious it would be to see people going ""waaaaah"" through system after system with a whole horde of blinky lights hot on their tails.i'll imagine it for you. it would be very hilarious. very. -harvey birdman, attorney at baw!"
3/3/2010,and dont forget the buffer tankers 25% can be a huge amount of hp.also remebr the damage to the armor is in addition to the normal damge recived to the shielding - its not transfered its bonus damage to my knowlege.
3/3/2010,"i think people are missing the real issue here. see, the bonus isn't completely uselss, but is it really worth a rank 4 int/mem skill for combat players? armour tankers don't have a skill like this. to make things more balanced, i'd say introduce tactical armour reinforcement. again, a rank four int/mem skill that prevents armour damage from bleeding through to structure.either that, or make the skill do something that's worth a rank four skill. and to have lvl 5 as requirement for capital shield tanks is even dumber than making it a rank 4.a useful bonus? without making it op? pass. but how about we just say we'd like a review of this skill, ask ccp to look in to it and leave it at that?i'd be happy with that."

3/3/2010,"translation: stop complaining about our ineptitude, it's your fault that you didn't elect more capable and well-rounded players. it's not our fault that we're an inept csm! it's your fault!"
3/3/2010,shut up because you have no idea what you're talking about.
3/3/2010,"keep in mind that it's ccp who set out to get more people into 0.0, a design philosophy i am quite aprehensive about. the csm could have opposed it but i doubt it'd have changed ccp's mind on that particular issue. i'm not against the csm going for features like treaties, but i cannot honestly say that the issues brought forth by the csm looked like an even devide between pvp issues and pve issues. this may however not be entirely the csm's fault, as they only support issues brought up and voted on in the assembly hall, which brings out only a section of the playerbase.when i ran for csm i did a survey that showed exploration to be the most popular candidate for potential upcoming additions to the game. this was however not reflected by the issues brought forth in the assembly hall, and therefor, nor was it reflected by the issues the csm brought forth at the summit. so it's not all on the csm's shoulders."
3/3/2010,"a vast majority of players do not read the forums. if ccp/csm hope to truly hear the voices of the many along with the few, then they need to explore ideas on how to allow easier access to such things as assembly hall and such.how come there is no 'in game' polls and such? i am not talking about the in game browser but something more intuitive.we get like maybe at best a hundred or so replies on thumbs up or thumbs down (wish that was an option) on ideas when the player base is like 350k (not sure if that is accurate but you get the idea)my one sincere question i have for the csm/ccp is this:what is being planed to better connect the player community's ideas and opinions with the csm/ccp via easy access 'within the game' and when will this be?"
3/3/2010,"come next elections, vote that way, and get everyone else to do the same."
3/3/2010,i don't follow. you mean thru the in game browser or something better?
3/3/2010,what i mean is to vote for a person who wants these things you summed up there.
3/3/2010,"why can't the current csm get something like this done? every csm member should want things put into the game that would better connect with the majority of the eve population. unless they don't want the majority to have a voice in things.csm members, wouldn't you like a way to better connect with the community?"
3/3/2010,we complained about this during csm 3. hopefully we'll see a lot of tools when spacebook or mygate or whatever it is called is implemented.
3/3/2010,"answering ""shut up"" every time you get a reply you don't like it not the way to get meaningful debates on a topic.again, yours (current csm) lack of interest in the industrial part of the game and in pve show exactly why a 1 year term is too long. the whole csm seem to have a very unbalanced view of the game, favouring only one facet of it. you are there to represent all the players, not only those that voted for you. you can have a primary area of expertise and interest but you should not refuse to look all the other problems because they weren't on your election program."
3/3/2010,"a csm voted in by only a fraction of the playerbase is bound to be a warped representation of the playerbase as a whole. if that representation has a pvp oriented agenda, then it's only logical that they don't want to be overshadowed by a larger group of politically inactive pve gamers. unfortunately there is no way around this exept voting. if you can get the pve gamers to vote en-masse you'll see a radical shift in the political climate of eve."
3/3/2010,"he's not looking for meaningful debate, he's just being an idiot. i don't refuse to look at any particular area of gameplay but there are other csm reps who know much more about that sort of stuff. if someone wants something changed about a piece of game that i know little about, they will have a lot of explaining to do."
3/3/2010,"both z0d and song li are extremely capable industrialists + pve players, and as you'll note from my campaign i'm definitely a pvper but supported some industrial concerns on principle such as being able to build more stuff that is currently provided by npc's. lo and behold, planetary interaction looks like it might address some industrialist concerns and we talked with ccp about some of the details to see if it was going to go a direction we liked; it was.if you have a specific concern, voice it. if you dont like the candidate spread, do more work to get people who agree with you elected. talking about how ""industrial issues arnt addressed"" without yourself mentioning what those issues are is pointless whining. talking about how ""there are no industrialists or pveers on the csm"" when one of the richest industrialists in the game and a prolific mission/pos runner are currently sitting belies either your ignorance or intent to start an argument no matter the facts.i can hardly blame sok for losing patience in the face of such implacable uselessness. player ""dialogue"" like that is the reason ccp needs a group of players like csm. thanks for keeping us relevant ;)"
3/3/2010,"so people on the csm know little about the game. interesting. i would've guessed that from reading the minutes, but i didn't expect to see someone on the csm admit to it. kudos on noting that you're not a complete eve player, but rather a one-dimensional nub. csm is so pointless (well, except for leaked information for market manipulation i suppose), they should really just shut it down completely."
3/3/2010,if you believe somebody who tells you they know in detail every single aspect of the game then you are a gullible fool (and for 500 mil i can get you into a sov holding alliance with docking rights in 5 regions. don't delay transfer isk today!).the game is so complex that people specialise in one or more areas and that is the point here. no one person on the csm would claim to be a complete expert in every area. for example whilst primarily a pvper (and pvp trainer) i do limited industrial stuff (reactions and the like). i wouldn't claim to know in detail about invention or supercapital construction and so if topics like that come up it is the job of the csm reps with skills in those areas to do the initial investigation and proposals.but if i need to know about running a single person corp with a 2 week old char i'll be sure to ask your advice
3/3/2010,so you are saying the csm does not want an easy way for the entire eve community to voice their opinion with better in game tools? interesting.
3/3/2010,"i'm sure some current and past csm members would have wanted it, but you need more in order to make it likely it'll be put anywhere near a meaningfull place on the priority list. without the votes, i think it'll take several years."
3/3/2010,"""so you are saying the csm does not want an easy way for the entire eve community to voice their opinion with better in game tools? interesting."" *long, drawnout, sigh* i'd tell you to stop twisting word's into the most negative light possible, but i suspect you enjoy it. unfortunately not everyone prefers intellectual discourse. some prefer to go full in with an indiscriminate smear job.now now csm. remember the central room of eve forums. don't feed the troll. :-) it only encourages them. :-pi think csm 3 has done good work presenting and getting across a number of issues to ccp. keeping the player base up to date on their actions, and overall doing a bangup job.my only 1 complaint, just 1. is the capital jump graphic is still unresolved. ^_^"
3/3/2010,"the results - is something, that you get after the job is done. you can see the results of the previous 3 csm by comparing the meeting minutes, and the game changes in the expansions following after it.as for csm4, i have a strong feeling, that we are had allready achieved something, but its too early to see the whole picture."

3/4/2010,"yes! anyone who disagrees should read the fine print in their car insurance policy. it's like using your car to smash the front door of a banks so you can rob it and then asking insurance to pay for the dent. and can we maybe look in to buffing hulks? for how much they are worth they sure as hell are not 'able to withstand the dangers off deep space'. anybody other then me think its idiotic that you can muck a 150 mil ship with 15 mil worth of gank in less then a few minutes? suicide ganking is as silly as the name implies. you attack a ship get blown up and then concord does nothing to your pod as if it was your ship that committed the crime and not you. i say once ure ship is popped, concord should be able to catch you and arrest you. then you either make bail or your char sits in the can for a few days. get caught again and this time you sit for a week or two and so on."

3/4/2010,"in real life when there is a massive demand for something, companies tend to pursue creation of that thing. one of the most common and well-loved ships in the universe of pod pilots is an ancient droneboat that looks like poop. and what does creodron spend their time pursuing? the helios, which can field one (tech1 imicus gets three) drone, the eos, a ship that has twice its bandwidth in drone space to begin with, and only gains moer as a bonus (yeah, adaptability, i know, not my point!), and the sin, a travesty of a droneship (mostly because that isn't its role).these ships all have their roles. their greatest successes? the ishtar, a durable medium-sized drone carrier, and the ishkur, a mini-drone carrier. take the hint, creodron, pod pilots want more drone carriers and will make you filthy rich if you bother to make them.this is half a rant about the purest drone carrier in the game being medium-sized, and half a plea for more drone-based design from the company founded by this badass.what i want creodron to do to revamp their ships:1. 3+ light drones on the helios, remove its turret hardpoints, or don't make it a creodron ship.2. give the eos a *support* drone bonus and 125 bandwidth. it is a gang-supporting ship and would work well with rep bots and the like.3. creodron branded subsystem for the proteus, which actually allows it to function similar to any other high-end droneboats (lots of space, 125mb bandwidth).4. either switch the sin's agility bonus to a drone bonus or, again, drop the creodron brand. i'm fully willing to accept that the primary role of the sin is not effectively fielding drones, but if it is only going to be less effective than the base model for drones then creodron should have nothing to do with its inception.5. creodron faction drones, and worthwhile navy/rogue factional drones.6. i'd like to see the helios' bonus on the ishkur instead of more drone space, but that could be a game-changer.7. pure drone-boat battleship. the dominix has been dominating for decades, pod pilots are ready and willing to drop the isk for a new model, make it happen.8. overall, more ships with drones as a primary armament (like the ishtar) instead of an afterthought (like most ships). if they ever revamp destroyers or do a second tier i'd like to see a droneboat destroyer.9. drone-enhancing modules. i think i've mentioned this before. highs:small drone control unit+5 mb bandwidth, +1 drone controlledmedium drone control unit+10mb bandwidth, +1 drone controlledlarge drone control unit+25 mb bandwidth, +1 drone controlledroughly as tough to fit as the largest rail in that size (150mm, 250mm, 425mm).rigs:drone bay reconstruction+10 drone bay- cargo (standard penalty)edit: also, amarr/gallente skills-used rogue drone faction ships."
3/4/2010,supporting the hell out of this.eve does not have enough modules and rigs for drone purposes. i want to see the modules you introduced.
3/4/2010,"prolly ought to support myself.and, yes, i know pvpers are concerned about drone boats because they operate outside normal restrictions a lot of the time. i firmly believe drones are balanced in this aspect though.they can't really be ewared...but they can be blown up.they don't drop on the wreck...but they can be destroyed and damage your opponent even if they escape.they don't have to be fitted in module slots...but they can't be overheated either and have their own sort of slots.they have incredible range and adaptability (rr drones are much longer than unbonused rr, for instance)... but have to actually move to that range, and then return to be switched out.drone boats don't necessarily have to be dps kings, or even have all sorts of highs for neuts. i'm not looking for more domis here, but rather ships that use drones as a primary armament instead of a supplement to something else. i'd be perfectly fine with drone carriers only having 2/3 highs. i like the adaptability of drones, and the micromanagement aspect, not just throwing in the highest-dps thermal drones you can, siccing them, and forgetting them.drone boats are the antithesis of interceptors, mainly. instead of focusing on your own modules and piloting and tending towards twitch gameplay, it turns eve into more of an rts where most of your attention is focused on drone micromanagement. this playstyle should be supported better.ideally, i'd love to see drones become a big enough threat that someone actually bothers fitting up a ship specifically as an exclusive drone-killer."
3/4/2010,"won't support because of your high slot mods to drone control links. although i've been a droneboater my whole life and love em to death, you can't have +1 to drones controlled unless it is on a cap like it is now, used to be you could control 10 at a time but they moved it to 5 and doubled the damage, controlling more would generate waaay too much lag and make drones over-powered (i wouldn't complain though ;)"
3/4/2010,"lag is definitely an issue, and an unfortunate one. ideally, these would be balanced enough that we wouldn't see that many more drones in space. additionally, less guns firing would offset some of the lag. perhaps grouping of drones would be a good solution. most people send all of their drones at the same target, if they could be grouped into what the server sees as one entity somehow, it may reduce lag.as for overpowered, see above, drones are well-balanced. a 10-drone boat wouldn't be stronger than a gunboat in some ways, and weaker in others."
3/4/2010,"i like some of the ideas however mods that allow both bandwidth and drones controlled seems overboard. maybe keep drone controls as they are, but allow another highslot mod that has the same fitting reqs as guns (without awu and wu bonuses) that increases drone bandwidth by a maximum of 15mb per mod"
3/4/2010,"edit: nm, misunderstood your point of contention. yeah, nothing wrong with splitting bandwidth and drone control modules, as long as both are present. at that point it might be prudent to make the bandwidth modules lowslots though.and the modules have to be sized. 15mb is massive for a frigate, and not enough for one more large drone for a bs. doing a one-size fits all module means either small ships get screwed (because fitting requirements are bs-sized) or large ships don't have an option."
3/4/2010,"definately yeswell, maybe, more thought needs to be put into thatmore ships is too vague, that does not work.drone enchansing modules? well, as much as drone control modules sound cool, i do not think their addition will be good gameplay wise, hard to tell though. they would act as a massive damage boost. lag is not an issue when we are talking about specialized drone-ships as only a small percentage of the ships in a given fleet consits of such ships."
3/4/2010,add 20% damage - over 5 drones is the same as adding one more drone without the unbalancing possibilities (think about 5 large drones/sentryes + 5 ewar drones...) and the lag.
3/4/2010,"the ""unbalancing possibilities"" are actually the malleability that would make droneboats able to compete with conventional weaponry.point taken about the ewar drones though, they're balanced around a set of 5 achieving the same effect as 1 module of that size. essentially that means you'd be able to trade 5 high slots for 1 medslot. not particularly impressive.my point is: drones are remarkably self-balancing. there would be some interesting tactics that could be employed with these modules, but all of them have major weaknesses to exploit. they would, however, force some adaptation, which imo is a good thing."
3/4/2010,"""massive damage boost"" doesn't really apply, which is one of my key points. because the modules take the place of guns, they shouldn't result in more net dps. they should do a little less, but have to be dealt with differently. pure gunboat appears? you neut it (if it is using lasers/hybrids), or disrupt it. pure droneboat appears? you pop the drones, or screw its targeting (drones are more resistant to this than guns, but if he can't control where they go they're as good as dead).as someone who sometimes enjoys flying really cheap frigates/cruisers into pvp, i'd absolutely love to be able to neuter a droneboat by killing 5-10 of its drones. even if it killed me i'd have done damage way higher than that incurred."
3/4/2010,"a 10 drone boat would be much stronger though. thinkof 10 tech 2 heavys, and tell me how much dps that is putting out or 10 sentries on one slowmoving bs and also drones cause more lag than guns because the game has to create another little ship (5 actually) and they specifically already halved drone numbers and doubled the dps for this reason, if you double it again, it will be ludacris"
3/4/2010,"hi, i'm the eve economist, lets decide not to impact the market, but we'll just add a crapload of extra supply!yeah, that'll work!there's no way that prices are going to drop from this... making highend ores available in all 0.0's with sov upgrades does not impact mining in any way! nope!i'm not saying the sov upgrades are bad (i think they're awesome), but ccp should get their arses kicked for continuing to say that ""we don't affect economy"", then continuing to increase supply :/ (we saw this with increase respawn of ores in highsec as well)"
3/4/2010,venkul is correct: clear information on such a heavily discussed and important topic is vital.
3/4/2010,[request of information] souces of mineralsi always wondered what taste is the tritanium souce...
3/4/2010,"if only ccp would hire an economist that could easily whip up a chart like that and release it on the forums.instead of hiring an economist with zero experience in his field, ccp should have hired a player who read economics for dummies and had him make some charts. would have been 10000x more useful. supporting this to show how inept eyjog is."
3/4/2010,"i am also interested in the effect the various changes to the mineral supply are having on the in-game economy.imho, miners should account for the majority of minerals in eve. if that's not possible, it should still *not* be possible to build/insure/suicide ships for a profit. that's just silly no matter how you look at it. edited to show support."
3/4/2010,"this kind of information is extremely important to us industrialists. the sad fact is that only ccp has the ability to generate these numbers for us hurt as we don't have access to raw market data.you know what, that would be awesome if ccp could give us a market data dump say every month with all the useful information, but i can see how that would probably be too much work and too much data to handle."
3/4/2010,"while i support the request for information, there would need to be some major changes to the game before removing t1 meta 0 loot were possible. don't get me wrong, i'm all for this, but it can't happen in the game as it is right now without drastic consequences both on the market and on gameplay.for one, you'd need to add a lot more manufacturing stations (somewhere like 3x the amount currently available). as another, you'd have to make mining more interesting and profitable, maybe by altering the composition of most of the asteroids in the game.what i would recommend in this incarnation is to reduce the t1 meta 0 drop chance by 10% a few months before the expansion that overhauls all the aspects goes live, and continue doing this by 10% per month until there is no meta 0 loot available in wrecks. meta 1+ loot would still be available, as well as something like npc goods dropped (tags, etc) which would be a smaller income source for the mission runners.tl;dr: supported for more info, but don't alter drop rates until game mechanics are changed."
3/4/2010,this... i'm wholly against the removal of the said loot for obvious reasons (just think back to the days of being noob for crying out loud)top that off with the fact that i think the argument of minerals flooding the market from missions is totally off the wall... i want to see the proof in the pudding so to speak... won't reverse my stance until such time.ps: if they change it... bunyips proposed change seems like a good place to start.
3/4/2010,ccp needs to keep its player base more informed.supported.
3/4/2010,i like this idea....event systems and areas... should be both..... opens all kinda of possiblilties from people host them making isk to rewards for winners.
3/4/2010,"great idea, give armor tankers some needed love."
3/4/2010,he? why?
3/4/2010,"i know it is, but this is a good start. personally i have no real gripe with plated and trimarked bs operating as an rr blob. in larger scale fights you need that ehp otherwise you'll likely instapop.i do agree that the whole dynamic needs looking into, personally i'd like to see the fitting requirements raised on plates/extenders and lowered on reps or at least equalised. i'd rather see plated/extended bs limited to lower-mid tier guns with active repped boats being able to mount higher tier guns, but that's for another topic (and likely will never happen as it will screw over a lot of cruiser/bc pilots).your an moran."
3/4/2010,"why? because i asked why he thinks armor tanks are weaker than shield tanks? this clearly shows how moran you are, i havent even talked to you.your idea to boost bonuses is stupid ,instead of boosting the reppers/shield boosters this would only make some active bonused ships worthy to use these."
3/4/2010,protip: read the op.
3/4/2010,"theres always going to be a tipping point between active and buffer as numbers increase, unless you nerf the crap out of buffer. if you buff active tanking so that tipping point is more then well 2 you endup with broken 1v1/2v2 mechanics and ships that are still useless past the tipping point in fleets, not to mention the hulls which are meant to active tank don't have the best fitting setups for large fights (mainly blasters/acs).wouldn't it be better to tweak the bonus to +10% to repair mod and +10% received rr? that way the ships in question stay usefull past the tipping point. the disadvantage over a resist bonus is 1/3 less primary buffer and the requirement of rr/active tank to use the bonus."
3/4/2010,"i'm on board for the principle of the thing, although just going from 7.5 % to 10 % may not be the right fix.i'd like to see a bonus like -10 % to capacitor requirement and cycle time for repairers per level. this would make them rep twice the dps at the same amount of cap and also give them a more even repair rate (as opposed to long cycle times). it'd also mean one pulse of a repper wouldn't take as much cap."
3/4/2010,"or a better one make them unkillable until they fit up a repper. why not?it wouldnt be more unbalanced than your current proposal.so whats the problem with boosting reppers/boosters instead of some ships? then even without bonus there would be reasons to fit active tanks up,and bonused ships would still be 7.5%/lvl better at it."
3/4/2010,"because there's nothing wrong with reps as a module. they function well on their own in a lot of situations. the problem is simply with ships that are ""forced"" (via bonuses) to fit them in situations where they don't work well.the solution is to make them work well for those ships, even in situations where repairers don't usually work well, not to boost repairers for everyone at a risk of overpowering them in situations where they're already good."
3/4/2010,"so wouldnt boosting bonus to 10%/lvl make those ships op in situations where they're already good?because for those self repair bonused ships both changes would be the same , but for not bonused ships in your version self repairing would still be unwanted."
3/4/2010,"if you really want active tanking to be viable the answer is simple. you boost the rep amount done by modules. if you think 10% more boost is enough you're crazy. think more around 25% more boost. for example a t2 xl sb boosts 600 hp. a 25% boost would then make it rep 750 hp. this cannot be only for ships that have in your opinon, active bonuses. for example the rokh has a resist bonus but is a great active tank. and i feel sorry for hype pilots because the slot layout and pg does need tweaked. whatever the change for active tanking, it needs to be across the board and not to select ships."
3/4/2010,wow something everyone is agreeing on...
3/4/2010,yes.

3/4/2010,loli mean come on i supported the freaking topic and he is still complaining?
3/4/2010,"*if* it would have any effect at all on server load, i'm all for it. making it excluded by the passive module boosting skills might take a little codework, but i don't think it'd be extreme on either side (it isn't a 5 minute fix, but it isn't a major architecture change).that said, the developers know how much server load damage controls generate (presumably), and they also know how much work it'd be to change that (presumably), and they so far haven't found it worthwhile, so *shrug*."
3/4/2010,this
3/4/2010,"i'm sure this had been done a gazillion times already - but what about implementing a simple reputation system?many forums allow you to do something similar - you can give people ""positive"" or ""negative"" reputation based on interactions.consider it an extension of the standings system - maybe a public database maintained by concord. for example you could give people negative reputation if the scam you or gank you. or give good traders positive reputation for good trades or completion of contracts etc.you'd have to flesh it out much more than that to minimise abuse (ie. negative standings can only be applied if they fail a contract, or kill/attack you - positive only at the completion of a contract, etc).this could also lead to a renewal of the contract system - i'd love to see a more open system - both in more freedom in how i can make contracts, a cooldown period (even just 5 mins) to help minimize scams, and allow a character to show their contract history so contract bidding can take place - ie. say i want to 'hire' miners - i can make a contract saying that i will pay a flat rate for ore/minerals for 1 week starting next wednesday. people can ""bid"" for the contract, and i can see their history of what contracts they have taken, who was involved, and what the result was (a kind of ebay like feedback system without comments). you could flesh this out to a ""i want from 200 to 1000 of this item @ 123isk per item, on a weekly basis, indefinitely"" style contracts.yeah.."

3/4/2010,"last i checked... your ""freaking"" missiles/hybirds/ballistic weapons don't shatter after so many shots and are very easy to maintain as far as tech 2 ammo.secondly... reloading is not the same as being forced to change ammo twice (once to get out and once to put it back in and not to mention penalties associated with ammo types) to get the damn thing to load.so care to try again or are you just trolling to be trolling?ps: if your going to troll then at least be rational and smart... trolling like a ****** is embarrassing."
3/4/2010,"very well then. not supported because you are complaining about a 3 or 4 second (at most) crystal swap out time, meanwhile it takes every other weapon 10 seconds to change/swap ammo. sounds most like the problem is that crystals break down at different rates. push to have crystal damage made more consistent so that in a rack of 8 guns all 8 crystals break at the same time."
3/4/2010,"the really funny thing about this thread is the last time i saw drakes opinion on the subject of fixing laser crystals this was his response.so i have to say.to quote someone""stop whining""seriously... drake's been mining with tech 2 deep core strip miners along with the associated mining crystals and he's never had any trouble keeping things straight.and they work on the same basic system that laser crystals would. all drake had to do was make sure drake loaded used instead of new when he switched things out.if he can do it.. you can do it.this proposal smells of cheese and crackers.... not supported.what all of a sudden faction crystals are a problem for you so we should now change it ?not supporting purelly because the topic has been raised bydrake ""i dont see the issue not supported"" draconis."
3/4/2010,"cloaking, as a whole, doesn't need a change. the only thing that needs a change is a pilot's ability to stay cloaked for long periods of time while they aren't even playing the game, effectively locking down key mining systems and trade routes while they sleep.i agree with the post at the bottom of page 1: disable auto-repeat on cloaks and give them a 10/20/30 minute duration. if you are indeed actively engaged in playing this great game, then you will be able to press f1 again to put your cloak up when it cycles off. if not, then say herro to my li'l probe.if that's a problem, you can always log out."

3/4/2010,"since there's now secure time codes, people should be able to scam in-game with insecure gtc's (clarification: selling a fake gtc for isk would be allowed; selling one for real-life money would not). perhaps something can be implemented to let people use isk to buy gtc's from other players like plex (not just securely buy them from ccp), but there's no reason to continue the ban on gtc scamming now that secure timecode trading is allowed. it goes against the spirit of eve/dark universe that new eden is supposed to be.-slimy"
3/4/2010,what sort of scams do you think should be allowed?
3/4/2010,um...what are you smoking? i'm thinking you should stop before it kills any more brain cells.

3/4/2010,supporting my own topic
3/4/2010,"i'm syssin, and i support this topic."
3/4/2010,"scamming gtcs, which have real world monetary value because you can legitimately sell them for real world money, has legal implications. ccp are quite right to avoid these.as said above: there are thousands of in-game items you can use to seperate chumps from their isk, without exposing ccp to legal liability."
3/4/2010,"you name is apt. maybe throw in the word ""tit"" for good measure, though."
3/4/2010,"would never happen. gtcs are purchased using real life currency. if people get scammed out of gtcs the chances of them buying more decreases, and ccp and authorised gtc sellers lose business.it's also why ccp won't let you move plex in a ship...if someone get ganked while carrying plex in their ship, that's real life currency down the toilet, and ccp would be on the receiving so many rage petitions, they'd never get anything else done."
3/4/2010,*thumbs down* you got plexes to scam with.
3/4/2010,"there are no legal implications since you wouldn't be selling a gtc for real-life money. you'd be selling it for isk, which is not ""owned"" by anyone since one's isk is a number on a server run by ccp. essentially, you'd be giving someone a fake number for isk, not a fake number for real-life money."
3/4/2010,good idea
3/4/2010,"this is nothing more than the developers of eve to maximize their subscription dollar.there is no reason to have 3 character slots if you can effectively only use 1 at a time.not being able to train multiple characters is simply to slow down your progress in the game, and milk the monthly subscription fee for as long as they can. the problem is, they're not getting the new subscribers, and they're losing existing ones. maybe they want it that way, i don't know.anyone i talk to about eve has the very same reaction 1) what? i can't level up on my own? it's time based? 2) what? i cant train/try characters simultaneously? what if i screw up one of my characters and have to start over? no way am i paying for that man!"
3/4/2010,forum mods should punish people for necro'ing bad proposals.
3/4/2010,"by nerfing buffer tanks, active tanking would be more viable. it would let small armor gangs in 0.0 be able to fight more than one fight without offlining their modules in deadspace to remote rep each other with their utility high slots.idea from this thread:"
3/4/2010,yes. let's boost alphaing. make ganking even easier.no. not supported.
3/4/2010,"there are some situations in which this is sound logic. this is not one of those situations. tanking is not a contained system, but rather a countermeasure. weakening the stronger method thereby weakens tanking as a whole, and weakening as a whole of a countermeasure affects the overall balance (as the poster above noted, it shifts power even more towards gank).this is a viable change, but only if you rework dps as well (gank v. tank is a more contained system)."

3/4/2010,iirc ccp have increased the defences on ships several times because people were dying to fast in fleet fight.so now why do we want to undo that generally popular move ?
3/4/2010,on kill mail yes
3/4/2010,makes sense
3/4/2010,"supported. i've taken to buying entirely different sets of hardeners for ships that are based at the same station and never used simultaneously, simply because it is *that* annoying to jump into the ship, unfit it, and then jump into the other ship and use the modules.ideally (although it'd require a lot more codework) ships wouldn't be truly fitted until undocking. all modules would rest in a combined module pool, with the fitting window just showing what the ship would be like if it were to be fitted (upon clicking undock). it wouldn't function any different than now, with the exception of modules currently fitted to other ships being available for fitting to a current ship.could cause issues with cargo bay mods though."
3/4/2010,"ok you miss understood what im talking about, i am not talking about the relative size of the color (yes each color is 96 bits) im talking about the increase in parsing time on the database itself.so for instance (using arbitrary numbers here), lets say currently there are 32000 people that play eve (im not saying 32000 people logged on, im talking 32000 paying accounts). each person has 5 ships, all with custom paint jobs, you are dealing with a database 160000 enteries now, (this number is most likely alot higher, i would say that most people own more then 5 ships total), instead of roughly 231 color pallets (that must be parsed)so, again, same situation 30 ships jump into a system, currently a database of ~231 enteries is parsed for each ship that jumped in for its associated color pallete.custom paint: 30 ships jump into a system and a database of 160000 enteries is parsed, for each ship that jumped in for its associated color pallete, (this does not even include the possible join needed to associated a specific ship pallete to a specific piolet.now where i should stand correct myself is, im more talking about load time here, instead of lag. as soon as all the palletes where loaded, the normal server lag would be the same as it is now. but you would see a increase in load times, upon jumping/cynoing into a new system, with large fleets (this would really only affect densly populated systems, or during large fleet battles.)also this is assuming your allowed complete control over the color schemes.i do beleive having access to any of the color schemes that share between the tech one, tech 2, and faction ships would be a more plausible and liked idea. but then youd have to ask about those ships that only have 1 color scheme (my poor hyperion...) lol."
3/4/2010,"considering servers are specialy made to hold and ""deal"" alot of data i dont think it would be a serious load. expecialy with new technologys like solid state harddrives, 1 tb harddrives, octalcore processers (8 cores) and like you said yourself there are allready ""other"" paintjobs used, t2 ships, mission ships, rat ships and so on, not to mention iv seen some pritty interesting and exotic looking test server toys in the graphics catagory. the minimum of what im trying to get pushed though is to make all those paint scemes publicly avalable for people to pick and chose from. i admit using a r/b/g system would use more space and cause more lag then the preset method but it creates a nicer universe/look to the game cause ships will become more personalized.and thank you admin for the clean up"
3/4/2010,use a t3 ship.strategic cruiser skill bonus: 5% reduction in the amount of heat damage absorbed by modules per level.
3/4/2010,"i already doi thought when i proposed this that it would be interesting to allow standard ships to do the same but at a fitting cost.yes passive or ofline modules can be used to sink some of the heat/damage, but only a very limited amount, not the same that could be sunk using a dedicated module.this is merely an idea, that i thought might have some merit but apparently there was little interest so lets just move on."
3/4/2010,"overheating should be for short periods, right now you can already overheat most modules quite long, doesnt need to become even longer."
3/4/2010,make the bonus + armour rep / + recieved rrotherwise its always going to suck asoon as your up against more then 2 ships of the same size.the difference to resists is that it has alot less primary buffer & requires active support to work.
3/4/2010,"hyperion is wrong from the ground up. even looking at the description the designers thought there was a desire for a big blasterboat: there wasn't, because the megathron fills that role excellently.i mean, ideally, it'd be an awesome drone carrier, but people love/hate the domi so much i don't think that'd fly.the problem is that gallente don't have too many niches and their main ones are filled by their other two battleships.it can't be ""the fast close-range bs"", gallente already get the megathron and making it really fast infringes on minmatar.it can't be ""the drone bs"", gallente already get that one.it can't be ""the awesome huge-pg/armor bs"", because thats the amarr claim to fame.it can't be ""the big ewar boat"" because gallente ewar is terribad.i guess you could turn it into a bs-sized logistics ship. seems a shame with the awesome battleship model to make it a repairmobile, but some really heavy rr bonuses would make it a major fleet asset."

3/4/2010,why do we only hear a few out of all the csm members on threads?
3/4/2010,"probably because they can't be bothered responding to such a whiny little nitwit. i'm sorry marlona, i'm sure you are a good fellow and everything but with the amount of negativity and terrible posts you put out i'm surprised your computer hasn't spontaneously combusted. i bet you're fun at parties too."
3/4/2010,your just mad because i don't give you a pat on the back for breaking the nda.stop being mad.
3/4/2010,"m8, i don't need your personaly approval, in fact i'd probably think less of you if you did (like some of the mouth breathers on these boards). however you seem intent on twisting every bit of dialogue, every communique, every forum post to your 'glass-half-empty' viewpoint regurgtating the same arguements over and over again like some sort of cow-troll chewing the cud.also, yeah, the nda thing. there's no need to keep bringing it up every time you respond to me. u mad, i get it, ok?"
3/4/2010,"people will react in simplified ways to complicated issues every single time, no matter what you do. and the vast majority will not respond to insults by changing themselves. even a troll can be 'translated' and if you do, you discover there's always a legitimate concern underneath the bad language. i could ofcourse tell both parties to stop flinging poo at eachother, but they won't. it's human nature."
3/4/2010,"here is my problem with the csm.*darius johnson shows picture of ""rainbow land"" during fanfest and says, ""ccp, fix this.""*ccp works closely with csm to come up with a resolution.*eve is presented with dominion which did nothing but cater to the power blocks.*csm claims that they had nothing to do with it.*csm members of power blocks ask ccp, ""fix the game where alliances can get in 0.0 without becoming part of power blocks.""*ccp and csm talk about treaties.*csm says treaties could be a solution to this problem.*csm says grouping together is human nature. while i agree it is of course, but to put up fake sobs over, ""why won't small alliances go into 0.0?"" just to get more features and tools put in game that just cater to the power blocks.*i suggest to change the way standings work to be similar to war dec's and the fees involved and csm comes running in saying that, ""you can't stop people from being friends! this new idea we have to better 0.0 is far better."" excuse. and all it is is some new way to keep 0.0 the way it is.i want to see conflicts all over 0.0 not none of this team a vs. team b only crap with 20,000 grid locking, system crashing, super ultra blob whatever crap.bottom line is if it in any way remotely could have a negative affect on power blocks, they will do whatever it takes to make sure the idea never sees the light of day.this is true. you know it, i know it and everyone who reads this thread knows it.the day csm stops fake complaining about how sov mechanics cater to power blocks is the day i stop calling them out on their bull****. it just truely is pathetic how csm works. either its some scandal going on or something being pushed forward for political reasons instead of what is best for the eve community./rant off"
3/4/2010,"having to asume the posibility that you're either correct or incorrect, the notion that you feel you cannot trust a csm that has ties to an ingame powerblock stands either way. in real life politics there are laws in place in some countries preventing this conflict of interests problem, in eve, there are no such laws. treaties and dominion don't seem to be the core of your issue, they're just the symptoms, no?so let me ask, is there any way you can think of that'll allow you to trust the csm even if it contains members of powerblocks? what sort of evidence of their impartialness are you looking for?"
3/4/2010,"i understand this. but when i or anyone else calls them out on such things in question, they throw up their hands in denial. nothing anyone can do about that. a lier is a lier.when the csm members start represnting the eve community and puts aside thier own political agendas. that day, i fear, will never come."
3/4/2010,"well, they're opting for closer contact between ccp, the csm and the players, which seems to be something that benefits the players more than any partial csm member. so there are good signs around, wouldn't you say?"
3/4/2010,"nothing i can say will convince you that there isn't some big alliance boogyman pulling the strings. as to what darius or any previous csm did or said, i can't speak for them so i won't.if you are going to accuse me of lying then kindly point to a post or otherwise where i have been untruthful rather than slinging mud in this general direction.i'm interested to hear why formalised treaties to remove the need to ""blue"" people everywhere would be bad but that some kind of 0.0 wardec (which would simply be a treaty in reverse) would be good. perhaps you would be so kind as to point me at this proposal you raised so i can take a look."
3/4/2010,"interesting stuff with regards to overviews in station, and docking while scrammed. wouldn't it be fair to say that the issues of neutral reppers, docking and jumping mechanics is a greater issue than general docking games?"
3/4/2010,"neutral repping wouldn't need to change with ccp's proposal (you could scram the logistics so it can't dock). however i would prefer this idea to only kick in after the target has agressed (e.g. you have to undock and shoot somebody before you can be blocked from re-docking by others). in that situation repping would have to be considered agressing too. i concede that will be viewed as a kick in the teeth to dedicated logistics cruisers.as far as gates are concerned, there is already a viable counter to a target de-agressing and jumping - have tacklers waiting on the other side."
3/4/2010,"thanks for posting the minutes. i would also like to thank all csm members, clearly a tough job. i find it extremely difficult to be critical of the people or the process for a couple of reasons; 1. the effort and time required by csm members, 2. the nda leaves me blind to a lot of details. all i can do is review the minutes, please correct me, which is nothing more than a minor snapshot of the discussion with ccp.reading only the minutes from this meeting it seems many aspects of eve were under represented. a meeting of this importance not to broach topics such as pve, markets, industry, ui, exploration, wormholes, lowsec and technical but talk about black ops bs's seems rather insignificant. it is not to say a topic such as black ops bs should not be discussed but when so many other macro issues are left behind it really looses it's importance to the grander scheme. once again, because of the nda i am blind and maybe all these items were discussed in detail. a while back i played swg, post nge (i know<U+FFFD>). they also had there own csm, galactic senate. a platform where players elected senators to represent aspects of the game. i was quite impressed with the delegates because they were all experts in their field of game play. while the representation was outstanding it was doomed to fail because most proposals were cast aside as, ""don't have time or resources"". dividing eve into sections and electing qualified representatives might be something to consider. who qualifies? obviously people who play the game, but people who write guides and help others in their field and are experts in that area. they won't serve? find out why and what incentives or changes can be made to get them to serve. each delegate has an alternate and the most important part, we can recall them. i believe doing this, term limits are irrelevant and the macro aspects of the game are represented. i do commend you on hitting some really important topics. ccp not managing expectations for expansions and quietly cutting features were refreshing to read. the treaty system was a very important aspect of dominion and was a great example of this cut a promoted feature to never discuss again trend with ccp. also worth mentioning, ""the csm would like to have a budget of development time dedicated to going through a backlog of projects that they prioritize."". what good are any csm suggestions if we don't have commitment and communication to an agenda items status, well done csm.the most disturbing:""the csm calls for an increased dialogue with ccp regarding game design during the actual development process rather than after release of an expansion.""during development? how about before! do we really think once ccp has started development they are going to make any substantial changes? in my humble view, csm should already have a really detailed plan for tyrannis and pretty good idea what is planned for incarna (if that is the winter expansion). if csm only has the information presented in the recent devblog for tyrannis then sorry to say this, we are wasting our time with csm.one last time, just want to thank csm members for all the hard work."
3/4/2010,"you're probably not going to believe me, but i represent people that like to blow stuff up, regardless of their ticker."
3/4/2010,"now this i'd also like to know. way i see it, any large force would tactically do well to prevent any and all smaller forces from developing themselves near them, so even if small alliances had access, how could they stay there without being completely overrun by the bigger powerblocks, or becoming part of one? and what could large powerblocks gain from smaller alliances being near them, even if treaties are possible?"
3/4/2010,"one of the options discussed was that for example, smaller industrial and npc-ing corps could more effectively 'rent' blue status from a sov holding alliance in a particular region or constellation, without being blue all over the galaxy. this system would be a lot more dynamic than the current standings and could potentially get smaller corps easier into 0.0."
3/4/2010,"don't you think that the alliances would see such blue status renting corporations as being competition to the available resources in 'their' 0.0 systems, and that the big alliances would prefer to reap the resources themselves rather than to outsource it?"
3/4/2010,"the issue at the moment is if you want to let some smaller alliances/corps live in your sov space you have to set them blue and that blue status would be anywhere in eve. thus some alliances won't consider such options (having renters able to go into any of your sov systems for example).some alliances would quite like to be able to either rent space to other alliances or be happy to have smaller alliances living next door with some kind of no sov war pact (for example).treaties as originally described would allow alliances to have roaming pvp anywhere in 0.0 whilst allowing blue status in a few key systems (such as the sov systems of the smaller alliance). the benefit for larger alliances is a potential income stream as well as small gang roaming pvp. the smaller alliances get the pvp too as well as the chance to hold sov space (or rent outposts etc) in 0.0 without having to own a cap fleet to defend it from the locals or blue the whole area.it is a significant change over the current system and would open up new options which could become more important when planetary interaction hits.is it a perfect system? no, but it opens more interesting options than are available currently."
3/4/2010,"no because the sov holders could cash the rent and not have to bother with npc'ing themself, see also td's post."
3/4/2010,you guys keep dodging the question of how this is supposed to allow smaller alliances the ability to access 0.0 without being all buddy buddy with power blocks.*pets pay rent.*treaties are a tool to manage this.just keep spinning and spinning... this does nothing but enhance the current power blocks in 0.0. nice addition for low sec for say a peaceful mining corp wanting to rent from pirates or something.does nothing for 0.0 to open up access without being blue/signing treaties with power blocks. nice spin on the pet tool though.
3/4/2010,"if you are going to not bother to actually read my posts i'm not going to respond to your anti-csm hate any further.for the last time, read what i said. many larger sov holding alliances would welcome limited blues (that is blue status in a limited number of systems) to allow smaller alliances to live next door without dropping a cap fleet on their head. these larger alliances do not want to fully blue people so currently they are not receptive to the idea.is that clear enough? some alliances do not want global blue status with every other alliance in a region.got that?so a system as described originally could allow a smaller alliance to hold space next to a larger alliance with some mutual understanding of no cap/sov warfare and blue in a couple of systems. it doesn't have to be a paid for thing, some alliances (and i know this because i've spoken to them) would love a smaller alliance running regular small gang roaming pvp because it gives their small gang pvpers something to do between huge sov blobfests.some alliances would use it to allow ""pets"" to have access to certain systems but not their whole region.lets now address your next point.doesn't have to mean renting. some alliances (again i know this because i've spoken to a few) don't want to hold sov in all nearby systems but would be happy to have a smaller alliance take some in exchange for a no sov war policy. no isk changes hands, no blue status (except potentially in their home system). currently not an option but would be with the treaty system.how can you sit there and not think that opens up 0.0 to smaller alliances?whine about pets and renters all you like. how the heck do you expect a smaller alliance to hold space without having some no sov war pact with nearby alliances? no sov war pacts are not full naps, are not full blue status and mean roaming pvp is an option currently unavailable. would every alliance give such an offer, of course not but the option would be there.it opens up options not currently available and would enable some smaller 0.0 alliances to hold sov without having to nap train everyone nearby.and it doesn't automatically mean an isk requirement, i've spoken to a few alliances who would do this for free just for the roaming pvp chances.if you take the anti-csm blinkers off for a minute and actually think about it you would see that fine grained control with treaties == more options for living in 0.0.you keep repeating this but it isn't true. see my point above.i'll close with a question.how do you expect a smaller alliance to hold sov next to a larger alliance and not get face stomped by a capital blob seeing as how you detest the idea of diplomacy.if you choose to ignore the difference between having the option of limited ""no sov war"" pacts and having to choose between fully signed up nap/pet relationship or no 0.0 then i can't help you."
3/4/2010,"wonderful example, everyone want to firm a treaty saying ""we will get isk from you for using system x, but we will camp every adjacent system and blow you up when you try to enter it"".maybe you should think a bit more about this?you and her want very different things, i doubt you will ever agree on what you are discussing.she want a way to get in 0.0 with risk but without the need to become the serf of someone, your reply is all about as you can become a serf. maybe it is not possible to do it in another way, but it is still fairly unpalatable.all your post is about the wonderful life of being the sparring partner of mike tayson in exchange for access to the gym. don't seem a great deal."
3/4/2010,if you have a treaty with a nearby 'powerblock' that won't protect you from the nearby powerblocks you don't have a treaty with. do you expect the powerblock you have a treaty with as a small corp or alliance will stick it's neck out for you in defense against an opponent that you yourself as a small corp or alliance have no realistic chance against?
3/4/2010,maybe you should. because if you can set it for single regions or constellations then it's easy to set an area with access for your renters.
3/4/2010,"don't give them easy kills and they won't waste their time camping use other ways to get stuff in and out of the system, it isn't hard.the point is at the moment the only two options are blue every alliance living nearby (which means blue to them everywhere in eve) or don't live in sov 0.0.in all seriousness you have to weigh up the offers. don't assume every alliance will want isk for this type of arrangement. i can tell you for a fact is not going to be the case 100% of the time (again i state i have discussed this kind of thing with other alliances already but without the treaty option it isn't as likely to happen).that is something you have to decide. some larger alliances would offer that kind of thing (not wanting other larger alliances living next door). other people will bring in mercs to help defend instead.there are more options with a treaty system than a basic blue everywhere in eve or not at all arrangement which is the only current system.again i say this is not a perfect idea but it opens up a ton of new options which are currently missing and should be fairly simple to implement (if system == x then standings := y)if you are expecting changes to allow small alliances to hold sov and be able to solo defend against larger alliances without at the same time making it utterly impossible for larger alliances using the same game mechanics to be unseated then i'm afraid there isn't anything on the table at this time."
3/4/2010,"what i'm more concerned about is that the 'smaller fish' in that big ocean will see limited rewards with increased risk from the much bigger fish. the bigger alliances take up all the really good bounty, and can defend themselves against the other big fish. the smaller alliances that are there through treaties get the scraps, but can suffer great losses against much bigger opponents. is that unrealistic of me to think?"
3/4/2010,"don't forget empire level 4 agents compete with 0.0 isk income potential pretty well. so we are back to the whole, ""why should a alliance go out to 0.0 to be a pet? oh, forgive me, i mean sign a 'treaty' with a power block.also about the solo defend thing. not going to happen. here is why.""listen up everyone. pet number 14, err, i mean that alliance we have a treat with in constilation whatever is being invaded.""""but not all of us will be blue to each other if we all go to help out. what can we possible do??""""here. we modified everyones treaties so we will all be blue there.""""wow. pure genius!""""assemble the blob!!!"""
3/4/2010,i demand that the csm provide me with information that proves how useless they are. failure to do so will only prove how useless they are.

3/5/2010,"that's totally dumb.how often newbies have to confirm, that tehy want to do something that is involving concord action? 2 times? three times?it's like the big red button, with some text in capital letters clost to it reading: ""if you press this button, the universe will blow up, are you sure about that?""after you pressed the button another button appears asking you to confirmoif you are really sure about that...in my opionion, the following happend in the csm/ccp discussion: the pvp-csmler don't wan this to change, that's it.but that does not matter, it is not logic, since newbies will not leave the game after acknowledging four times, that they want to blow stuff up. they will leave, if they become suicide ganked. and suicide ganked is backed up by a juicy insurrance payout. thats stupid."
3/5/2010,"i dont think touching insurance should do it, because every once and a while i lose a ship to npc's and i'd like to get the insurance from that.i think its a simple ui change.try this as a message box :""you have just been volleyed by a battleship in jita. explode? (y/n)"""

3/5/2010,"this! oh, and bump :)"
3/5/2010,"yes, do it."
3/5/2010,after following this thread and the one before it. i think both rails and blasters just need a lot more damage. make having the drawbacks of the other guns worth it. it's that simple because kinetic and thermal are heavily tanked by almost all ships. just look at the resists and how ships are fit.
3/5/2010,1+
3/5/2010,yes please
3/5/2010,this will add to the rang of tactics that can be used and thus gets my vote <U+F04A>
3/5/2010,"just keep bumping up the bounties on rats, and make the ore rarer..all high qualities of ore or they produce more...really, we would just need more corporations to be comfortable with the isk they can make to live out there, and put up with pirates. eventually it would lead to 1 of 2 things..either the corps get blobbed out by pirates that refuse to take losses (most likely) or 2, corps get themselves situated out there and try to take some pockets and bottlenecks to rat and mine in. if it's 1, then pirates can make some more isk, as well as being more vulnerable to anti-pies while making that isk. if it's 2, then the corps may evolve in skill and actually enjoy the random pvp aspect of it and defend their home areas in low sec from other corps. if a small increase doesn't work, increase it again...it will draw some attn. i'd say 10mil an hour ratting in a decent sized system would compete with passively running level 4's in a raven without looking at your screen hardly ever (not counting salvage), plus the level 4's in low sec do pay out better also, but can get a bump as well."

3/5/2010,"i think this is painful problem to most of pvpers. and i am personally tired of this... useful ability. in most cases capitals use self destruction to dramatically reduce to minimize profit for opponents.as result, those who ""killed"" s/d capital, gets nothing... no loot, no killmail, etc.but what does it cost to capital pilot? he gets very nice insurance payout, and no killmail, which can show that he is unbelievable noob, who lost a carrier to industrial ship, or something like that. main issue is that capital ship now can avoid true loss in the majority of situations, and no matter, is he attacked by small hac gang or good battleships gang. his active tank allows him to live long enough to finish self destruct procedure, and leave opponents holding the bag (except large 0.0 blobs).this problem is in csm's plans for discussion ("
3/5/2010,agreed
3/5/2010,"1) no, i don't like this. maybe if applied to all ships to dicourage self-destruct in combat. needs to be loocked at carefully.2) sure3)no point if first point is implemented, 10 minuts seems absurdely long to me. so no on this one. 4) yes, as alternative to #1, but cannot be used together with #1. 5) yes, as alternative to #1 and # 4, but they cannot be all used together."
3/5/2010,"like everything else in eve, what a player may try to obtain can be denied from them. sd'ing denies the aggressor the km and rightfully so. irc ccp has stated that the lack of km for sd is working as designed and i for one can completely agree with them. sorry, but bring more dps or htfu. in eve, nothing is given to you and you have to take the initiative to obtain what you want.nothing makes me happier than pilots tears from not getting their precious km. even better yet is when they fake said km because ""they earned it.""on the issue of insurance, i agree with you to a degree, but sd is a legitimate game mechanic for a number of reasons, such as getting stuck, some missions, ect. ect.nothing is more pathetic than lazy pilots demanding to be given something that has been taken from them. hmmm, this sounds really familiar. like pilots complaining about salvage not being theirs maybe?"
3/5/2010,couldnt have said it better.(not supported)
3/5/2010,"i think that people who kill capitals aren't doing it for the loot. it's a not a serious argument to make against self destruct optioni see how self destruct option is kind of a downer, for the gank squad (lets face it, it's only used by victims of overwhelming force). but it puts a nice twist on the whole pvp scene, and it goes well with eve's core theme of hurting people."
3/5/2010,"meh... i don't like self destruct right now for the simple reason that the person who is doing so is having his cake and eating it. he is able to deny all loot, the killmail and he gets his insurance payout. it's a win/win scenario for the self destructer. now, i couldn't give two hoots about the killmail or the loot as long as the person doing the self destructing gets hit in the balls by it (figuratively speaking).for those saying 'htfu' and 'bring more dps'... really gents? you want to encourage more blobby behaviour?"
3/5/2010,"then why current csm have ""selfdestruct balancing"" on their issue list as major issue for this year?the topicstarter personally participated in killing of 10 carriers and his corp participated in killing or killed 16, not mentioning numerous others which selfdestructed. and not mentioning that he in sum have more than 700 kills.on the other side, you have 36 kills for all your lifetime (which is very, very small number) and 15 stupid losses.so you have no right to say ""sorry, but bring more dps or htfu"", because you're, in fact, totally incompetent in common pvp, not talking about killing carriers.are you piloting a carrier to be happy about it? do you ever selfdestructed one?if not, you're just yet another carebear theorist, which enjoys posting his incompetent opinion."
3/5/2010,i dont see it as encouraging blobs. but when you dont have enough dps to kill them in time you might not get the kill mail. no need to whine about it. move on and find the next target.
3/5/2010,"if it's a win win to self destruct, why don't you do it more often?like when your territory is being attacked, simply self destruct and all your troubles go away. the enemy gets nothing, so they would be too discouraged to come in the first place, right?"
3/5/2010,"wait.. what?nope. there are tons of carriers doing lv5 missions in lowsec, and some of them faction/deadspace fitted. and u dont need large amount of dps to kill it on a mission. in example, today we (3 bs with neutralizers, drake and dramiel) have caught natos on angel mission in iges, but he self destructed on 50% of structure. no loot, no km, wtf? and this kind of stuff happens all the time."
3/5/2010,"your ideas are almost as bad as the ops. in fact, in some ways they are worse."
3/5/2010,"i like how they don't actually solve anything either. i'm sure there are greifer corps who would be perfectly happy to skill up some low sp alt pilots and just do it with t1 mods and hulls instead.newsflash dav, sp's are really only part of pvp, arguably not even that big of one. certainly not the main part."

3/5/2010,"very observant, and this is the truth. i personally asked ccp who are the people responsible for fw. there is no-one responsible. when game design is confronted with any fw matter, they go ""this is not my responsibility, and i'm already assigned to x"", and the issues the csm send to them end up in limbo as they do not get assigned to any team.same thing with bug fixing, there is no-one sitting on the other end to pick up fw bug issues. gm people do not know how the fw mechanics work either, so when confronted with bugs/exploits, these tickets do not get resolved properly either.fw needs a team permanently assigned to it, period."
3/5/2010,"i support the motion to revisit fw and fix the purpose and mechanic of ""plexing"".however there must be a general scope review, from capabilities of npcs (with their ewar for example) to standings/lp gains for doing fw.i would like to see fewer quantities of npcs in plexes, but a bit more dangerous with not only jamming/dampening/disrupting/painting ewar, but warp scrambling and webbing too. with long range and short range weaponry on all factions. and with plexes that do look like real military garrisons (maybe stasis towers? neutering towers?).executing fw missions, which i have, is a bridge between missioning and real pvp, but real militia corps do not gain the ""war"" by running them, they win the war by capturing systems and killing opposing fleets. please take these concepts into consideration."
3/5/2010,"there are a few bugs in faction war that need to be fixed. but i think fw gets a low priority because its not seen as really important to players wallets. you don't lose anything tangible when you lose systems. whereas if there are bugs in null sec players are losing large amounts of isk. while i agree that any bugs should be fixed i can't see how this is somehow more urgent than other bugs. as far as a larger ""fix"" well everyone has different (often contradictory) ideas about what that should be. more npc involvment less npc involvement etc. i would like to see people propose real things that they would like to see fixed as opposed to vague requests for more attention. for me i would like to see a few more faction war exclusive items."
3/5/2010,personal pos is not that bright idea. i would prefer tho system where one corp can transfer the ownership of tower to another corp thru some system. or the very least fix the friking acsess rights to tower so that i don't have to keep several altcorps and altalliances around just for empire towers.edit: support added just for the heck of it
3/5/2010,"this proposal has been entirely overhauled to include 50% less suck.new proposalhello everyone. i'd like to outline a system that i've drafted up to severely hamper macro mining in eve, and hopefully return eve's economy to a healthy state.macro mining has historically been somewhat of an arms race between the bots and ccp. ccp bans accounts and the botters acquire/hack more. while i applaud ccp for initiating and maintaining such a vindictive effort, this never-ending story needlessly ties up ccp's resources and only merits short-term success. while i initially thought justice could be served via actual players, this was simply to hard to implement without opening up a can of griefing worms. what follows is a somewhat long-winded explanation of my revised idea. read on.as the macro issue has long been a scourge to the players of eve, it is time to acknowledge it amongst the people of new eden. by identifying it as a 'rogue drone invasion' or otherwise sentient-artificial threat, ccp would be able to combat the macro'ers within the game itself, without breaking immersion. macro'ing hulks et al. would be understood within the game universe as compromised by rogue drone forces, criminal hackers or other sci-fi what-have-yous. this perceived threat would allow for the creation of...industrial policecreate an npc force of industrial police, an extension of concord, who (in empire space) fly between belts of various systems and 'scan' any ship that has 'fired' a mining laser/strip miner/mining drone at an asteroid in the last five minutes. this scan would consist of what is essentially a captcha image presented to the miner in a pop-up window, modified of course to fit the eve design/lore. this would need to be filled out within 15 minutes. upon successfully entering the code, the police units would leave the miner to his business, and continue scanning other ships. if however, the miner fails to enter the code correctly, the police units would be able to request that the miner cease mining operations in the area. further attempts at mining in the same region would be met with concord aggression.i must stress that a) these captcha images must be easy to read and b) that the pilots are given several tries to accurately respond.it is also important to note that the frequency of these vessels should be both entirely random, and also able to respond to player reports of suspected botting. whether the units are randomly spawned similar to npc pirates, or are actual roaming entities does not really matter. they should however, be fairly consistent while not being an overt nuisance for average players. they should also remain in the belt/area if the miner were to dock up. this is to prevent macro'ers from simply 'dodging' the police.i know it's not perfect, but its as best of a solution i can think of short of an entire overhaul of the mining system, which, come to think, isn't that bad of an idea in itself. but some sort of challenge-response test should be incorporated into mining, and this is one way to do that with mining in its current implementation.as a miner myself its frustrating to have to compete with what is essentially people generating isk for nothing.tl;dr: concordokken the macro miners!thoughts?"
3/5/2010,really a new idea.and as i said the last time ... no.
3/5/2010,darius - lets form a new industrialist police force that would keep these idiots from proposing ideas that destroy industry by harming the legit ones eh?oh... that means hell no to you op.
3/5/2010,you dont need to justify macro mining in roleplay terms what is wrong with you
3/5/2010,"what about macro ratters? they are a bloody pain, as soon as you enter system they are gone.one option dont allow use of cloaks, but only on specialised ships. but everyone will cry about this.but having police checking all the time may be a processing issue, thats alot of checking constantly, think of all the people mining at the same time, also what you if you get a massive mining op, with say 50 players.the best thing to do is firstly petition it, and to be honest when i have done this ccp have check it out, cos in about 2 weeks i never saw them again. also if they are in 'your' space, then you have to do your bit a patrol the systems yourself, keep doing it they will move.what you got to remember is as well, its rare you find a 'hostile' macro - either ratting or mining. so if they are system then just go start ratting yourself or mining. as all they do is hide and cloak up, eventually log, so really they shouldnt even impact on your mining or ratting.and if you wasnt there before then you wasnt using the system so what difference does it make if they macro or not so to speak.yes this maybe a isk issue but help remove them yourselves, and thats the solution you see macros make an effort to remove them yourself."
3/5/2010,and what of all the legitimate (albeit stupid) afk miners who set up before going shopping?and what of all the legitimate miners who are chewing the fat over a nice juicy belt?no one their right mind would ever want to penalise another to the extent you seem to want. there is a reason why ccp is trying (with questionable success) to minimize the damn pop-ups.there is no easy fix to automation in games. best one can do is make it so bothersome to set up that fewer people make it through with sanity intact.- random belt spawns rather than static.- surprise rat spawns.etc.
3/5/2010,"or we just wait for ring and comet mining, where ccp said that you cant macro it."
3/5/2010,"or planetary interation, and besides, you don't think macroers can take care of your ""code""? -.- ya, you added one step to the program and annoyed the hell out of the rest of the real miners, way to go, someone pod this guy >_>"
3/5/2010,"i did some ""interruption"" of macros once or twice by convo spamming them but hek thats costs me isk,.. maybe if it was 0 cspa (or wotever) to convo bomb them and then be able to pop them without having to worry bout being wardec'd or corded and then loot the ""bots"" stuff, more ""live"" players would get involved,.. maybe."
3/5/2010,"i could see the captcha going into effect, not just for miners though. captcha pops up after a certain amount of time in game. sometimes 2h, sometimes 3h. never the same everytime. sure, macros can get a couple hours in of mining before they are logged off and flagged. if people want to be online and not at the keyboard mining, they aren't really playing anyway.edit: the captcha wouldn't interfere with anything going on onscreen. that way pvpers in a fight wouldn't be interupted. if the capcha isn't filled in properly within say, 15 minutes, person is logged. that will keep people at their comps playing instead of overloading the game with afk's also. an afk would be fine for 10-15 minutes, other than that log off. even people running scouts dualboxing can switch back and forth ever so often. no harm there. if the comet mining can be used to prevent macroing...why can't they do it for regular mining? also funny how many people who try to block attempts to end macro mining are pvpers. not for the ganks, but because of their alts maybe?p.s. op, drop the indy police bit, that part really does suck/supported"
3/5/2010,"if you still believe that captchas prevent anything, you are pretty naive. captchas count as broken."
3/5/2010,"rather than constantly putting down any attempts to stop macro mining, how about try to help with it. or at least give up your macro account name, for fun ;)seriously, and don't give the usual ""i think im a badass so i'll post some stupid ****"" kind of post. reply to this why you think macro mining should be legit, since you constantly put down any attempts to help end it and never give any positive posts to assist in ending it."
3/5/2010,suicide gank the miners? works for me. how about you?common sense has nothing to being a bad ass. captcha are broken and annoying in the web already. no need to annoy people in game with it.
3/5/2010,he didn't say macro mining should be legit you asshat.he said it would disrupt legitimate miners.can you read? because i'm starting to think your just more upset over the macro mining than anything.
3/5/2010,"i support this. i think macromining in highsec should be legal, but since it's not ccp needs to do something about it even if that will hurt the amount of subscriptions they get. this solution would discourage both automated macroing and ""human macroing"", i.e., afk mining."
3/5/2010,reported for encouraging the violations of the eula.
3/5/2010,"if someone can't handle a pop-up or two, that takes a few seconds of their time, every few hours while they're mining than they are most likely afk or botting.its not exactly the 1st amendment that we would be giving up here. mining as it stands is a very relaxing activity. as long as it was done in an immersible way i don't see any issues.i wouldn't be surprised if someone told me that the majority of the mined ore comes from people who do abuse the rules, as it simply isn't feasible to compete with macro'ers at this point.you don't see any automation in games where the interactive nature of them outpaces the complexity of simple programs. if captcha really is the son of satan to everyone, than perhaps we should be looking at ways to increase the extent to which a miner is involved with mining.it can't remain as is, to say the least."
3/5/2010,"macro mining is an inseparable part of eve at this point. most large 0.0 alliances would lose a lot of their poses if they didn't have access to cheap and plentiful fuel mined by macros in high sec. their industrial divisions cannot produce the amount of fuel needed for poses.why do you think ccp introduced jump freighters? to make it easier for 0.0 alliances to import the mass amounts of minerals, fuel and t1 goods produced in empire by macro miners.don't get me wrong, i don't support macros at all. i'm just calling it like i see it. back in 06 i started this game with industry and mining as my chosen profession, and i spent over a year training for it. but then i realized that i just can't compete with guys that have their macros on from dt to dt every day. i could carve out a battleship every few days, where a macro miner could spit out 3 a day.i'd like to see macros gone, but i just don't think it'll ever happen. most of eve wants to pvp, not make ships. but every ship lost in pvp was made by a player. every t2 ship was once a blueprint; mined from asteroids; invented from datacores and a t1 blueprint; harvested from a moon; cyno-jumped out to 0.0... in the timeline of a ship's journey through the sandbox, it's flight in pvp is only a small wedge.eh, this is starting to sound kinda rant-ish.in short, ccp ignores macros because macros keep their game running. dey took muh jooorb!edit: bring back jihadswarm <3"
3/5/2010,"no no and damned well no!i wish all you mob who suggest boosting/fixing active tanking modules in preference to boosting the active tanking bonus would get it through your thick damned skulls that the issue here is not the mobule but the tanking bonus balannce.currently the 5%/lvl resist bonus is superior in almost every way to the 7.5%/lvl rep bonus, there is a margin a very very small margin that a repair bonus is superior in raw dps tank. this btw is the case even if the resist bonused ship goes active tank also.if you boost the active modules, it won't change a thing, the resist bonused ships will still be superior because they can fit the same module.hence why the op asks for a repair bonus increase, then at least the repair bonus will have a clear superiority in smaller engagements, and not by a huge amount and certainly not a game breaking amount. but a clear enough difference to make it worth using a vulnerable tank such as an active bonus.were not here to fix active tanking modules, were here to fix active tanking ships."
3/5/2010,"so you are saying that these active tank bonused ships are fine atm,even when fitted with such modules.then why do you want to boost them? just because they have different bonus than other ships? it makes no sense.bonuses are different ship to ship that doesnt justify that bonuses have to equal to eachother, only ships performane matters,and as you said these ships work fine as they are now.if they are fine there is no need to boost them!""were not here to fix active tanking modules, were here to fix active tanking ships."" ""then at least the repair bonus will have a clear superiority in smaller engagements"" so you just want to make you ships the only ships reasonable for smaller engagements? awesome for balance :(what i see is that you want your active tanked minmatar ships even better,but these are fine and such a change would make them op.thou i agree that some active tank bonused gallente ships are weak and should be boosted ,but then there is the ship hull is the problem not the bonus itself,better slot layouts and fittings could fix them easily."
3/5/2010,"ahh... you still don't understand? i cry for your parents... hope they didn't putmuch into your education.i will try one more time to explain the situation to you. although i doubt you will read it...currently with the way resists, incoming dps, tanked dps, time and cap use. if an active tank bonused ship and a resist bonused ship both fitted an active tank, the active bonused ship would only be superior by about 2% in tank, however as soon as both ships have to disable their rep due to cap, the resist bonused ship wins out. the superiority of the active tank bonused ship is also only within a very small window of incoming dps.note: if a small gang v's small gang situation had both gangs with a logistics cruiser, the resist bonus ship would be vastly superior than an active tank bonused ship. negating even the minor superiority of active tank bonused ships in small engagements.once the incoming dps is sufficient enough, i.e medium sized engagements and up, the resist bonused ship is superior by a great deal in all situations because an active tank ceases to be viable, rr, ehp and for small ships speed, are the only accepted tank for those larger engagements.because the resist bonus is so far and away superior in the vast majority of pvp (not that i gripe about balance in tanks for large engagements), it is only fitting that active tank bonused ships were equally superior in small engagements as resist bonused ships are in large engagements.p.s if you don't understand this then sod off, your a waste of forum bandwidth."
3/5/2010,"i wondered when you'd tip up in this thread spilling your man juice and love for the rokh everywhere... i'm not just refering to the hype but all ships with this bonus.i'll refer you to nian banks' post, he put it quite well..."
3/5/2010,/signed
3/5/2010,vv
3/5/2010,"in small gangs the maelstrom is pretty damn close to the rokh in tank. the maelstrom has the cap advantage making it better if it has to tank a long time. so say you get your 10% boost per level. that's only 12.5% more boost with bs 5. that's less than popping a blue pill. if your arguement is to make active tanking viable in small-mid size gangs then you better ask for a bigger buff. even with hg crystals right now my active rokh still melts in larger fights as it should. so imagine if you get a buff to your ships that equals having hg crystals, it still won't be enough. i'd be very surprised if ccp buffed active tanking in any way. but good luck."
3/5/2010,"mining as profession was discussed on latest summit csm 4.0 like it was discussed with previous csms. there where some ideas tossed around and as far as i understood ccp is looking into it.as sokratesz said, summer expansion is all about industry and comet mining is in future plans (to our knowledge), so we should all wait and see how things go.also any ideas on how to improve mining, or make it more interesting, are welcome. if you have any feel free to poke me or send ingame mail."
3/5/2010,"yes, please."
3/5/2010,"to be fair this was something i hadn't thought of, but let's consider how much it would actually increase ehp of your average hauler: probably on the order of 1500 ehp, which would come at the expense of cargo capacity. tbh i don't think this seriously weakens the suicide gank mechanic."

3/5/2010,"oh my god.... you sit here and argue however you have 100% no idea wtf you are talking about. dcs are not stacking nerfed with anything... pull up eft or mess around with the fitting manager in the game...also using arguments that making it passive would cause extra server load is one of the dumbest standpoints i have seen this year...do you know how the code works? nope. do you know that items can't be sepperated from the effect of skills? nope... so stfu and stop talking out your ass like you have some knowledge about how the game works when you are clearly making it all up just to support your trolly argumentative banter...now, for my opinion... no, dc does not need to be passive... it's already the most powerful low slot tanking item in game, why do we need to make it even more powerful??!?"
3/5/2010,do you behave like this in real life because maybe you should keep reading this before flipping out. all of my points were absolutely valid points until it was determined that a) it is seperated from the skills already so any extra load it causes already exists and b)the stacking nerf does indeed impact it's shield and armor resistances just not it's hull resists since there are no hull resistance modules. ie if you have 20% resist and add in a hardener to get it to 50% and add in a dcu you only get 5% more which would be about right with the current mechanic of an 87% reduction in effectiveness for the hardening bonus of the dcu on top of the standard reduction.it's a debate moron try to keep up. in a debate i can be pursueded however most people don't think of such basic things when they shout there idea's to the eve community such as opportunity cost and load so i point those out regularly. if you don't like it then don't visit the assembly.
3/5/2010,"although de-uro dc is an active module, de-facto, it is a passive module as it has no capacitor consumption. even if you are neuting a frigate with a battleship, you will not shut-down the damage control, it consumes 1/30 gj/s which is literally nothing. that means every time it it being activating there is an unnecessary request to the server, as it does not serve a practical purpose. no, i do not want it to be passive because of afk'ers, we are not fighting afk=ers by making uncomfortable ui. red raider- please, you are trolling so bad it hurts. he is not complaining, he points out how obviously stupid your argument is. i really hope that you are trolling."
3/5/2010,"i only behave like this in rl to people who are so ignorant about their own ""interpritation"" of facts that they think they are right when they are 100% incorrect. dcs do not have any stacking penalty what so ever. you sit here and type about how assembly hall is about debates when this simple fact is not up for debate because it is a fact!.the debate is ""do you think dcs should be passive modules"", and i have already stated my rather simplistic point of view, no. the debate is not about if dc has a stacking penalty because it does not. the % of resistance added by the dc is based on the meta lvl of the dc and has no other modifier! try it out, put on 2 hardeners, then put a dcuii on after. if my resistance on thermal is 61.8% (2x eanmii) and i put on a dcuii it increases my thermal to 67.6. that is a 15% increase, the amount of increase to thermal if the dcuii was not effected by a diminishing return...stop trolling already... you're not good at it. 0/10"
3/5/2010,"even if you are right it's irrelevant and you very well may be right but i honestly don't care. also if you are saying that 5.8 is a 15% increase then you need to rework your math but that's not a central issue here. if you pay attention i am not the one who started the resistance argument that was the op stating that passive resists are not affected by the compensation skills and i corrected him. then he went off on a tangent just like you are on. funny how that works are we alt posting now?my point in being against it as a passive module has already been resolved and thus i supported the op. in the end it doesn't matter because the afk hauler hitch will probably kill it anyways though i honestly don't understand why you wouldn't just equip a web/jammer to resolve that problem.but oh well, keep railing against me for debating a topic. it won't make me stop."

3/5/2010,"there is a difference between a glitch and a mechanic... this is not a mechanic frustration... its obviously a glitch when it comes to grouping.now if your going to just poke fun and laugh then go right on ahead.. i'm sure the mods will love to ban a few more trolls.i don't have a problem with inconsistent rates.. i don't even mind having to reload in the middle of a fight so long as its the same crystal set.but having to switch to a different crystal set then switch back again just to pick up a replacement crystal seems a bit ""unintended"" as far as mechanics go.all other ammo types just reload...its like having to reload nuke rounds but in order to do so i have to shove in plasma before i can reload nuke rounds.and yes all other ammo types don't behave like crystals... fine... but the principle is the same.you'd throw a fit about it if the situation was reversed regardless.again... i don't mind the nuisance of reloading different guns and different rates... just doesn't make sense that it doesn't follow the same basic pattern for all other guns.if anything its a glitched mechanic when it comes to grouping and not necessarily the gun.if the guns where not grouped... it wouldn't be an issue as the one gun would stop while the others keep cycling... and it will likely mean i just have to do that.only issue is the damage is inconsistent and tends to vary more when individually fired.that and its not as cool looking."
3/5/2010,"i prefer to lob missiles at things but i hear you on the cool looking aspect. i sometimes wish i could keep my missile launchers in one big group for mechanics reasons, but have the launchers ripple fire them 1 second apart cause a buncha missile launches look cooler then one launch.in regards to shooty things.. when those lasers are in a group and you right click on it is there an option to 'reload' or 'reload all'?"
3/5/2010,"i know what you mean... grouping missile launchers just doesn't work for a number of reasons.as to your question... the ""auto reload"" is always turned on... and asking it to reload causes an error... don't recall the message but it didn't make sense to begin with."

3/5/2010,"given ccp's past willingness to award characters or accounts special gifts (zephyr, apotheosis, snowball launchers, ...) it seems that it'd help break up the long, hard slog from new year's holiday to labor day (international; may 1st) or memorial day (usa last monday in may) if ccp awarded something fun in the spring. april 1st, known as ""april fool's day"" in the west seems like as good a day to celebrate as any other non-religious holiday.my modest proposal for this year's april fool's day award would be a roll of duct tape in the hold of every assembled minmatar-designed ship (and possibly minmatar hybrids like the daredevil). additionally, ccp should make duct tape a new consumer trade good, sold in some minmatar corp stations. you know that minmatar pvp pilots would buy it to put in their ship's holds (""hello isk sink!""

3/6/2010,"ok, i forget some some carebears misuse the carrier for mission running.and i'm all for the inhumane treatment of carebears, but there's gotta be a different way than messing with the self destruct for caps across the board. maybe modify missions so they don't allow carriers to finish them. after all, npc rats deserve better treatment too, more than some carebears"

3/6/2010,agreed.
3/6/2010,"selfdestruct maybe used to deny loot, that is fine with me, killmail needs to be sent out."
3/6/2010,"i think the self destruct timer should be based on ship size (class).if the ship reaches the end of the timer then no kill mail should be issued to anyone.on another note of the whole, ""he self-destructed and is getting to have his cake and eat it too."" crap. since when was anyone able to make a profit off a fully fit carrier or dread when is fit? take into account the amount of isk to buy the insurance and the cost of the mods, fighters, drones, rigs. you get the idea.only t1 crap fit, non-rigged, t1 ships that are sub-capital are you able to pull this off, and not on all of them.they are still out isk, especially on capital ships. not to mention the logistics of getting said stuff replaced.in closing i am in support of the timer being adjusted based on the ship size itself. i have had many ships self-destruct on me when i was unable to kill them in the 2 minutes, but i shrugged it off and moved on with my life. maybe it is time for you to do the same?"
3/6/2010,support it.
3/6/2010,"no, the whole ""whine point"" is about something entirely different. ask yourself a question: why the loot drops when killing ships in eve? because, among other things it's reward for the winner.but with capitals we have always-working, no-penalty ability accessible to anyone despite their skillpoints, ship state or state of battle, that allows victim to deny this entire aspect of game (loot drop + killmail generation). i think that is fundamental reason why csm plans to discuss ""selfdestruct balancing"".also, i agree with you that making s/d timer dependent on ship size (and making it more big for capital ships) is most easy and rational way to nerf self destruct. but i also think that killmail must be generated nevertheless, for proper counting of kills and losses on killboards."
3/6/2010,"you assume ccp cares about killmail and killboards, but they dont."
3/6/2010,agreed
3/6/2010,"yes, they care much about it. if they don't, they'd haven't implemented killmail portion of eve api (via which most of modern killboards receive killmails), nor they have had implemented in-game display of corporation kills and losses (almost in-game corporation killboard)."
3/6/2010,agreed
3/6/2010,i think 15 min sd sequence for caps will solve most of the problems. you either have 15 mins if the victim logs or if the victim sds. also there should be a notification that a cap started sd sequence.
3/6/2010,"self destruct should do a few things:create a wake damage similar to a smartbomb over (for a capital) of say 30km/r (smaller, of course, for smaller ships) putting out a damage of 1/3 the s/d ship's total base hp across all damage types.there should be a killmail generated with the last pilot to land a blow prior to s/d receiving it. the pilot of the ship would be on that killmail with the weapon listed as self destruct initiator, no damage.insurance payout as normal.i'm torn as to weather all modules/cargo/drones should be destroyed or all drop, but either way it should be all, not just a random collection. if all drop they are all damaged, regardless."
3/6/2010,"you should stop posting. you are terrible.i wasn't implying that the cap ship pilot is making money out of it. i'll spell it out for you:you are doing an anomoly/jump to a cyno at an ss/undock from a kickout in your carrier/dread and somehow (most likely due to an iodine deficiency or extra chromosone) get caught out by a 6+ man hac/recon gang. you scream in alliance but noone is around to help. they are nibbling away at you and while you can tank them you don't think it will last, at least not until backup can arrive.option a: let them kill you. embarrassing killmail generated, aggressors scoop your precious mods but you get your insurance.let's call that 2:1 in favour of the aggressor.option b: self destruct. no embarrassment and humiliation on your alliance killboard, no loot to the aggressors and you get your insurance.let's call that 3:0 in favour of the self destructor.this is what is flawed with the system. at least one of the parts of 'option b' should be changed, either make it so that there is some record of a self destruction, enable some or all modules to drop or deny the self destructor his insurance. that's called balance mate."
3/6/2010,"i doesn't take all that to sort it out. apply it to all ships and be done with it (removed the free-isk gimmick to boot):1. no insurance on s-d.2. mail to top damage dealer.3. loot drop, slightly reduced.basically make it into the time honoured naval tradition of scuttling ones ship rather than having it captured."
3/6/2010,"but you're implying that the pilot is losing nothing. the pilot loses his ship and all of the modules and drones/fighters attached to it. all of that needs to be replaced. the pilot definitely isn't gaining anything, he's actually losing quite a bit. 3:1, the loser and his alliance are out a capital ship, and have to replace it. insurance alone won't cover that.2:1, the aggressors have successfully denied their enemy the use one capital ship, so it's still a military victory. just because they didn't get a killing blow or an epeen-stroking text message, they've still completed their objective, the destruction of a capital ship.the pilot has to deal with the embarrassment of losing his ship, and the logistics of replacing it. probably a loss of respect within his organization, and they may feel disinclined to help him replace it."
3/6/2010,signed
3/6/2010,"the ship is dead anyway so stop harping on about 'the great loss to the individual'. fact is, in a situation like that where all is lost and you have the time there is absolutely no reason not to self destruct, there are no drawbacks or penalties for doing so.no, even at platinum levels a cap pilot won't 'make money' on a cap ship (especially after cap fittings and whatnot) but he's not losing anything at all by chosing to self destruct. in fact he is gaining by there not being any record of the engagement (and hence no loss of respect within his organisation) and denying the aggressors their loot.this scales up even further with supercaps. it's unlikely that an active supercap pilot will lose his ship to hostiles unless he logs off and is blobbed, has an appalling fit or faces a massively overwhelming weight of fire in the order of 100+ dreads or has a misguided sense of e-hono(u)r."
3/6/2010,"this is simply the result of us thinking differently and having different priorities. you're looking to earn a psychological victory and enhance your ego, through the embarrassment of your target and the record of the engagement. i'm more concerned with the victory itself. embarrassment can be gotten over, and is worth absolutely nothing if my target or his organization has any sense of perspective.your argument is based on the premise that you as an attacker get absolutely nothing from a target that self-destructs. the fact that you don't get a killmail is a problem with the culture, not the system. you're simply failing to consider that you're still scoring a military victory.your scenario states he called for backup, so his organization knows he came under attack. he's a known carrier pilot within his organization, so he'll at some point have to account for the loss of the ship. true with enough money, he could simply gloss it over and buy a new ship and outfit it, but that's costing a lot. again, military victory."
3/6/2010,"seriously, i put up a constructive argument against your post and you go off on ""you should stop posting. you are terrible."" cop out reply.does the self-destruct feature need to be balanced? sure. does it have to be the lark way? no.stop being mad lark."
3/6/2010,the fact of the matter remains. you lose absoloutely nothing by self destructing while the attacker loses everything.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.
3/6/2010,"oh my god, how dare someone stop an attack from getting a kill mail by self destructing! of all the things wrong in eve this is the worst! take away a players right to blow up his own ship, it's just not fair!what, no loot because he self destructed!? oh, my god that's just terrible and unfair to everyone involved in the fight. i mean how dare they self destruct their ship and destroy all that loot.he got paid for self destructing? wow, that's just as bad as those gankers who suicide themselves in hi-sec getting paid too! just unreal, this need changed.change it, change it now ccp!!!oh, not supported by the way. if you're worried about this then bring a bigger fleet. i would seriously be upset if i had to sit for 30 mins while i wait for someone to peck away at my shields and kill me slowly. the self destruct is working as was intended and should remain so, learn to kill faster and bring more friends."
3/6/2010,i think it's right.
3/6/2010,agreed.
3/6/2010,"wow... everyone is all for getting rid of insurance for an act of defiance...won't happen folks, until they get rid of insurance for suicidoken.imo the sd should cause a pretty nice boom that's sufficient to put a major hurting on the attackers as stoned said, but drop the mods as normal."
3/6/2010,yes. yes.everything about this: yes.bumping for great justice.
3/6/2010,iirc for day of darkness ii the guy was invited to ccp hq and could use their inhouse tools.
3/6/2010,"oh i like that, it is a nice addition!"
3/6/2010,"yes. i am not reading most of the replies, but if it hasn't been brought up i would like to see planet types depend on distance from star.... ie an ice planet at planet i (closest to star) doesnt make much sense when you have lava planets very far out. last time i checked, i believe they were random (correct me if i'm wrong)"
3/6/2010,yes. a feature like that would keep so many people in the game too.
3/6/2010,"wouldn't it be nice to, just once, see an idea for dealing with macro-miners that didn't involved boring, annoying, or otherwise interfering with legitimate miners in the process?just once?"
3/6/2010,"no thanx.1) captcha are annoying and suck majorly.2) the whole idea of adding captcha is a direction i hope eve never takes on any issue, in-game or out.3) captcha are easy to crack.3.a) ai neutral networks have a great deal of success (90%+) with any easy to read captcha, only impossible to read horrible unusable captcha images are non-machine readable.3.b) where neutral networks fail you instead can use **** surfers as a free workforce, who must solve your captcha from eve before accessing free ****."
3/6/2010,"there's some good thought at the heart of the concept, but the implementation is terrible. going off what someone said earlier about random belt rats, i'd go with.1. message goes out onto the grid about a pirate patrol being sighted heading out among the asteroid fields.2. concord beacon appears3. miner has 10~ minutes to activate the beacon, which results in concord intercepting the rats.4. if the timer expires without interaction a fairly sizeable (for hisec) rat spawn occurs, maybe even up to a battleship.pros:keeps things much more immersivemore ratting opportunitiesperhaps a reason to guard hisec mining operations, maybe the rats would get stronger the more minerals being mined, resulting in a rat-farming crew accompanying a mining crew.cons:not particularly hard to add the ""activate beacon"" into your macro somewhere, but they could take measures to make it annoying to do (randomized names/distances/whatever)."
3/6/2010,"edit: actually, i changed my response. i have come to grips with the fact that ccp is more worried about their numbers of subscribers than keeping the game legit for other players."
3/6/2010,"resurrecting this because... well, need more player input. the current csm lot are all concerned only with their pvp and not a whit about how the builders behind the scenes make all of those items they want to play with... except to randomly suicide the fool.they've got just one industrialist... just one. and they clearly don't listen to him much at all."
3/6/2010,"supported, but i'm anticipating a lot of blank stares from ccp on this one, since it doesn't exclusively involve 0.0 and/or things blowing up."
3/6/2010,"point the finger at the csm, not ccp. quite a few csm members have already come out and said that they have no interest in industry, and that they know next to nothing about it. their priorities lie in the combat side of eve, one even went so far as to call the industry side of the game overdeveloped and stupid. it is more important to get titans firing dd's in low sec than it is to represent the entire playerbase."
3/6/2010,keeping someone elses idea alive
3/6/2010,word.
3/6/2010,"because haulers are so hard to gank atm, right? the extra 1.5k ehp will totally imbalance the game?"
3/6/2010,"ok math time. an ubertanked badger ii (4x mse ii, mag scattering amp ii, heat dissipation amplifier ii) has 14.1k ehp with max skills, three cargo expander iis, and no dc. with dc ii instead of one of those cargo expanders, you get 17.4k ehp. for an itty v, the difference is between 12.7k and 15.8k ehp. but, given that people who afk-haul valuable items are not the sharpest knives in the drawer, i have serious doubts as to how many would fit their haulers competently. and of course fitting with reinforced bulkheads increases tank potential considerably--we're talking 25k ehp with a dual structure/shield tank on the itty with the dc adding a full 9k ehp, but besides meaning you don't have cargo expanders, those four reinforced bulkhead iis will slow you down by more than a third, making afk autopilot times considerably longer.anyway, if people are worried about the afk tanking, one alternative would be to keep the dc as an active mod, but have its cycle time be 24 hours. that way, you still have to activate it while jumping into a system, but it should mean that there is only that one server call per activation, which is a whole lot less frequently than once every thirty seconds (unless i'm totally misunderstanding how the server works, which is entirely possible)."
3/6/2010,"1/30 gj's is not literally nothing! it's practically nothing. sorry, pet hate of mine :pi have had my damage control deactivated repeatedly by a curse in a fight a gate camp a while back. had to keep flicking it back on. think they must have been running a small neut on it.i'm 50/50 on this so not supporting."
3/6/2010,dude... you fail... 5.8% is 15% of the difference between 100%(max resistance) and the 61.8%(current resistance)... the 15% is applied to the gap between 100 and 61.8 or 38.2. rework you're math and you will find that 5.8% is the resistance increase of a 15% dcu.as for me being an alt of the op... really man? are you really going to continue this pointless drivel?
3/6/2010,"the problem is that you confuse stacking nerfed with diminishing returns.what you are speaking of are diminishing returns, i.e. the resistance bonus is applied to the difference between 100% and the current resists. so the 10% resist of the dc in your example is applied to the 50% of the resist not already covered by the module you applied first. 10%*50%=5% (btw 10%*87%=8.7%)the stacking nerf is a modifier to all of a module modifiers if at least one of is modifier is stacked with another module affecting the same characteristic. if you have 4 modules affecting your shield em resistance, the first work at 100% efficiency, the second at 87%, the third at 57% and the fourth at 28% (when activating them they are considered in decrescent strength order, so the strongest give 100% benefit, the second strongest 87% and so on). for resists module both the stack nerf and the diminishing return modifiers are in effect, with the exception of the dc that is affected only by the diminishing returns."
3/6/2010,"the source engine has one, why can't eve? it would rid the youtube of all these crappy xfire videos (a couple of them being mine, admittedly), and remove the fraps.com label from the videos that are actually good.sure, one could pirate the full version of fraps to record, but it would be safer and simpler to have an in-game recorder, which records demos during gameplay, and renders them frame-by-frame after the user closes the client.thoughts?"
3/6/2010,"i don't think anyone knows what source is.but on the subject on hand... already raised by csm.check ""battle recorder"".no need to repeat what has been said."
3/6/2010,just a thought ... you could *buy* fraps.
3/6/2010,but that's not frreeee
3/6/2010,they want to live of something as well. not everything you want is free. pay the price or dont use it. simple rule.
3/6/2010,"no, the target never had a chance (in most situations) atleast he should be able to ""scam"" you for his implants. it's a gamble for him... if he dosent pay enough he's risking geting poped.also he's risking giving you any money because there's no guarantee that you wont pop him later.if you want the game to support ransoming, wich is currently a player driven feature, then the target must have 100% assurance that his pod will be safe after he pays, then some severe consequences are needed for a pirate not holding their end of a bargain.in shorteither make ransoming a full game feature with all the bells and whistles or dont touch anything"
3/6/2010,1
3/6/2010,"sto, hades rest its godforsaken soul, had the right idea: a separate channel for damage notifications. you could even set it to personal, gang, or fleet.just make a channel out of the notification process and if you want it, there it is."
3/6/2010,totally agreed.
3/6/2010,"ok, so before you go off thinking i'm making ganking legal, i'm not. trust me, lost my second proteus in a week to a jita ganker -.- anyways, on to the idea.i propose we make bounty hunting an actual profession, with real isk payout, and fun, and actually takes work -.- how we would do this is, have an npc ship (much like a rat, only mobile) warp around from system to system not doing anything but that, is warping, until someone engages him, then it's an all out fight, as if you were fighting a rat. the difference is, these rats have much higher isk rewards, are much harder to kill, and are much harder to find (as they are always warping) and they can go anywhere in eve. i'd suggest they start off deep in null sec, and have a more or less guided path towards empire, but still at random. this would add spice to bounty hunting, and you could have all new locater agents to use for this, which you'd have to work standings up, and the agent would give you the nearest target, and you'd have to track them around and hunt them down. now they'd take a little bit to warp, so your not chasing a frig in a bs or anything, but still not gonna stay in one system for a half hour. this would take teamwork/luck finding them, and would be worth the rewards. also, no commander or factino loot from null sec, cuz it's make those empire lovers get the same stuff as null sec so it'd inflate prices and make null sec not worth it, just stick to the bounty, as it is bounty hunting."
3/6/2010,"how. the. ****?oh, and about the idea... i fail to see how it contributes to the game. since highsec population is incredibly dense, the npcs will get picked off by randoms at the first few stargates it jumps. thus, this ""bounty-hunter"" profession will not be very viable."
3/6/2010,"well they'll be considerably harder to kill, and ya i know... i didn't mean to fall asleep while in space at jita ok? lol let's not focus on that, but i was just bored and trying to think of stuff to liven up high sec, make it a bit more interesting, and it could still go pretty far, cuz people might see them, but won't be ready to kill them, thus report it to friends who go off and track em. not every cruiser and bc can kill them, plus i'd like to add, that a good portion of high seccers don't carry scram (which is needed to catch the buggers) unless your at war in which case you won't usually bother tangling with him."
3/6/2010,heres some tips -1: don't afk2: don't use autopilot3: don't afk4: don't use autopilot5: don't afk and use autopilotoh and not supported.... repeat rehash of the same ideas already proposed.
3/6/2010,"did you not listen? i fell asleep that's not quite the same as afk ya nub, and wasn't on autopilot"
3/6/2010,so a gun which fires beyond 250km. it does a fair bit of damage. it also has alot of backfire; so like aoe effect. like the eryx or fgm148 javelin. also obviously not instant travel munitions.it could be put on essentially the 3rd tier dread. undockable behemoth of bad aligning. the gun could also have an acceleration factor which pushes the ship back. perhaps after 5 mins of shooting. it's moving a nice speed backwards that you cant manage to stop and align out of; because of your size.
3/6/2010,"ahh, yes. and we will use this giant gun to shoot at all the targets we have locked that are over 250km away that we....wait. i forgot. we can't lock anything over 250km away. how silly of me."
3/6/2010,you can fit a rohk to shoot over 250km!and as pointed out above the issue is locking.
3/6/2010,"on another note this brings up a new idea of a new sniper ship, that needs a special mod (maybe a camera drone) to be able to hit people from that far away! =p needs things like super good tracking and amazing skills, large caliber, just like real life lol"
3/6/2010,qft!there's nothing more annoying than a grouped weapon that utterly stops working because one of the crystals broke. :/ this is a non-issue for charges because you always have to reload an identical amount.
3/6/2010,finally... someone who gets it.feel free to rub it in the faces of the people who don't. you earned it.
3/6/2010,"you are aware that the weapons would have to be ungrouped to reload seperately right?also, i hear tell that 10 second reload times are completely not frustrating in those nasty little dogfight where the engagement is on a knifes edge and you lose because it takes your arty, auto's, missiles, blasters or railguns so long to reload.seriously? get over yourself. *****ing about an something where even the labour intensive way to reload takes at most 1/2 the time that it takes any other weapon system to reload or switch ammo? even with this excuse to whine amarr players dont have as long sat there unable to dish out dps as the matar, caldari or gallente."
3/6/2010,you are aware that you need to read the whole post before you respond as it makes you look foolish right?keep it coming trolls.it's an obvious f'ing glitch people... otherwise it wouldn't give a bloody error.go try it for yourself! i challenge you... go see what happens.and honestly i don't give a rip about rp'ing like you guys do so please give it a rest.i play amarr for fun... same as i would for matar or caldari or gallente.all have cons and pros... this is not a whine about dps... its a complaint about mechanics of grouping and reloading.and if... if (and that's a big if) you read my post you'd see i would likely ungroup and resume my gleefull fun of pew pew pew but your too hung up over yourself to get that... so none of my concern i guess.
3/6/2010,"the duration idea isn't viable, because you can't switch it off during that period eighter.."
3/6/2010,"if the practice allready exists, how will making it official bring more people into 0.0?"
3/6/2010,so you see what i mean about 'treaties' being nothing more than a pet tool?
3/6/2010,"i see your point, but let's wait what they have to say about it before anybody jumps the gun."
3/6/2010,you mean when csm plays the nda card on us? i will just wait for dev blogs directly from ccp or gold bar comments from ccp. anything from csm is like a box of chocolates.

3/7/2010,"keep the feedback rollin' fellas! in the meanwhile, up!"
3/7/2010,supported
3/7/2010,1
3/7/2010,do it.
3/7/2010,sounds like a pretty strong argument to me.
3/7/2010,"no support - railguns are intended to have greater ranges but lower damage than lasers, which is what they are usually compared to in this thread. the argument seems to be based around the fact that the extra range is useless, thus simply viewing rails as a lower-damage version of beam lasers.bringing rails towards dps parity would make them overpowered; reducing their range to compensate just homogenises them with lasers. i don't believe that the arguments in this thread has shown railguns to have a global performance disparity with regards to other long-range turrets that justifies them being improved. they are undoubtedly weaker than other turrets in areas where those turrets shine (i.e. alpha strike => arties, dps => lasers) but stronger in their own niche (range).railguns are indeed worse at being beam lasers than beam lasers are, but beam lasers are worse at being rails."
3/7/2010,"hello, i was brought over tho this thread by tagami, from a ships and modules discussion here.i rarely post outside of the ships and modules forum, and don't visit either the assembly hall or development forums very often. i do however care about the topic and would like to offer some comments and pointers.the damage modifier proposali'm not touching the railgun damage modifier proposal. at a glance it's a fair suggestion and i tend to not concern myself with detailed figures. i agree with the notion of taking the edge off some of it's extremes though and in that regard it's a fair approach to cut range in favour of damage (even if that may not sit well with players who rely on spike to compete in sniping, people using the deimos for that is a readily available example). wether 15% and 70% are the right target values though, i leave up to the discretion of tagami and liang. the concept i approve of.the powergrid proposali disagree with the suggestion to pg. those figures assume that the pg (or overall fitting) of the gallente ships is satisfactory, while in reality the gallente hybrid platforms suffer pg issues of their own and to some degree the same could even be said about the minmatar muninn (in regard to hacs). all of those ships are relegated to fitting mods and recurring downsizing to frigate sized modules. obviously the eagle is worse off than the deimos, which in turn is worse off than the muninn, but that doesn't add to the assumption that a deimos would be okay, and a good target value for percieved balance.in the larger picture, the assumption that gallente grid is fine and caldari need to be put in line is a poor basis for suggestions. a very simple definition of a good target value is assuming that a ship with a free utility slot should be able to fit something within it's ship class for the slot to be deemed effective. that's not to say it's a bad idea to downgrade to a smaller module, but to be limited to that, mark a good definition of it's shortcomming.the csm proposal and offsite linkthe first thing i'd do is to focus the proposal on the key matters. it's good to mention that certain things are affected to different degrees, but i think it spends too much time on detailing definitions. the different ranges serve a good example, since no matter how you approach it, you are presenting a definition you are trying to sell to the audience. giving an explanation of different ranges is a good reference to provide, but focus on things that your audience can relate to in a broader picture.00-12km12-25km25-75km75-250kmthat is a much more intuitive way to bracket things up, and define them by effects rather than how far different ship- and weapon sizes can reach. after all, when you fly a ship ingame you are not limited to just fighting ships of your own size. the 00-12km range is defined by webs, scrams, short-medium neuts and nos, their stopping power and the ships' that operate within that range and it's mobility. the second bracket 12-25km is defined by common point, bubble (disruptor) ranges that allow mobile (mwd) fights on grid, but not initiating warp to escape grid. the next bracket, 25-75km (medium range) is defined by a variety of effects from ewar optimals to the base control range of all drones. the last range of 75-250 km (defined as sniping range), is where only large long range weapons and range bonused effects occur.the terms scram/web range and point range are widely regarded and stapled within the community.you might need to define mid in contrast to long range better.further attention to detail in that regard, just risk throwing attention away from how the propsal relate to range."
3/7/2010,"i believe you miss the point if you think that the proposal is trying to make rails=lasers. rails are quite distinct from lasers, they have different damage profile and use both ammo and capacitor. rails have all the disadvantages of the other weapon systems (ammo volume, capacitor consumption, bad tracking, slow ammo selection), without any of the advantages (alpha or dps). lasers have so much better tracking it's not even funny.what the proposal states is that in order to have parity for the ships+weapon systems in the tactical envelope they engage, rails need a damage buff. saying that the rokh can hit stuff @ 250 km, when no-one engages there is worthless.if you want to compare, due to the nature of their bonuses, deimos is more akin to munnin, while eagle is more akin to zealot. mega is more like the pest, while rokh is close to the apoc."
3/7/2010,"i agree with that, but i think you're overlooking what goes in the other slots. it's become almost an expectation now not just to fit the highest-tier guns, but an oversized buffer module as well as a mwd and often cap booster as well. something has to give, and one man's ""realistic fit"" is another's ""going too far"". i don't think there would be any disagreement that there need to be compromises when deciding what to fit - often the utility slot can't fit something like a ship-sized neut, because all the powergrid has been used elsewhere (often with an oversized buffer).if you fit a cruiser-sized ship with medium-tier turrets, a single mar or 800mm plate, and your mwd + cap booster then i'd expect you to be able to fit a medium neut/nos/smartbomb/whatever in the utility high. if you're upgrading the guns, or sticking a 1600mm plate, or a second rep, then in my opinion you're using up your overhead from a neutral setup and don't really have a right to demand more fittings.the concept of bracketing ranges based on effects is legitimate and at the very least empirical. however, unfortunately i don't think these brackets really mean anything, or at least let us draw any conclusions. they're very broad, and while they do a good job regarding the effects of the modules they cover (for example, a vagabond typically has to operate outside of 13km), they completely miss out all of the modules that aren't on the list.for example, if a crusader can scramble a taranis and keep the latter at 9-10km, the crusader will almost certainly win. if the taranis gets inside of 5km it should be all over for the crusader. these are both classed in the same one of your range brackets, but yield very different results. if a taranis could hit at 10km like it can hit at 3km, the result would be very different, so i don't see what we're gaining by bracketing up the ranges like this.additionally, i would disagree with your upper bracket anyway. firstly because ewar modules typically have a falloff longer than optimal, so (unlike webs and points) there is no single cutoff point at which they stop operating but rather a very smooth over which their effectiveness diminishes. secondly (and arguably more importantly), being in or out of this range doesn't give a concrete advantage in the same way that being in or out of point/web range does. i don't know anyone that would relish being able to hit from e.g. 80km instead of 70km because now they're outside of ewar range.besides, i don't agree with your description of the upper bracket with respect to weapons - all medium-sized long-range weapons can hit past 75km, even on ships without a range bonus. at that point, unless we're discussing small railguns (which we don't seem to be so much as medium and large), everything gets lumped together into the same single range bracket. so what was the point of this again?as i posted above, i think this ""uniform range"" mentality is harmful, because it overlooks the utility of extra range. if you have a 130km optimal and the other guy has a 100km optimal, then that's rubbish if you're 95km apart, but amazing if you're 130km apart."
3/7/2010,"it sounds to me, like you're trying to use rails in a tactical envelope to which they are mediocre performers. why is it worthless to fire on your targets from a position to which they cannot return fire? it's the equivalent of essentially jamming the entire opposing fleet for the duration of them being out of range (and then giving yourself a 60% resistance boost if they manage to burn to their optimal+falloff) - that sounds pretty worthwhile to me.your argument is similar in concept, if not in scale, to comparing short-range battleship turrets based on starting 45km apart. of course the abaddon wins in this situation (and loses if the fight starts 5km apart).making the most of your own strong points, while denying your opponent use of theirs, is what eve's rock-paper-scissors is all about."
3/7/2010,"i don't disagree with the rock-paper-scissors approach, and this is not an effort yo make everything the same with just different skin. however you need to take into consideration the application of these concepts on the field. if we look at bs class, a position 170-190km away is just as good as one 230 km away (only enemy snipers can reach you and if your support is doing it's job, only on grid probing can get the enemy fleet to your position). it allows the fc to utilise all the ships he has in his fleet and not only rokhs. therefore, the tactical envelope within we have to consider the ships is pretty much defined by the rest of the fleet composition.same thing is for hacs or for support railboats.you can perceive the balance in game by looking at ship utilization really easy (you can check kms if you don't take part in 0.0 fleet warfare). in a bs fleet, count the number of rokhs, apocs, pests an megas. you'll realise that there is no demand for the range advantage of the rokh, while most megas gimp their fit decreasing dps to reach the tactical envelope. that shows precicely why it is of no worth to the pilot/ fc to fly/ have a rokh in fleet. megas are more common due to their capability to sport an armor tank keeping with the rr concept for apocs and pests."
3/7/2010,"it's a fair concern, i give it credit. mine, is obviously a definition based on trends and trends are not always a good basis for balance either. there are other ways that you can relate to though, if you want to take a step back and look at the legitimacy for those trends. if you assume for example, that the armor repairers were meant to be doubled in regard to the combination of shield booster and boost amplifiers; or that a cap booster is not an optional module on active tanks - you can see there is more to the argument about pg than just ""1600mm have become the norm even for cruisers"". instead, 1600mm have become the norm because fitting 2x 800mm is equally difficult. 1600mm is not as ""oversized"" as one would assume in that regard. most ships after all share a common idea of how many slots make up a certain degree of tank.what you gain is a general summary that provide an intuitive overview. any generalization base on majority. there is no perfect definition, but as opposed to majority your examples are exceptions.another way to look at that is by asking yourself four simple questions when you piece together a ship:- at what range do combat tend to become immobile in most ships?- at what range do i tend to be forced to commit to stay if i engage?- at what range do i tend to be able to disengage and escape?- at what range do i tend to avoid the majority of damage and effects?it's not meant to be an exact rule to apply and quench vivid combat, but it's meant to provide an understanding of what you can expect at a given range from a variety of ships (a gang, as opposed to a single ship). that an interceptor can point from 30 rather than 25 do not detract from the general understanding that you tend to be pointed somewhere in that vicinity.i also agree with you to some part on the comment about mid to long range. i even put a little disclaimer in my first reply there above you. you could easily define mid range as 25-70, 25-80 or 25-100 at your own discretion. it won't affect the context much though as there are so few effects that are concretely affected by those differences. whereas it is important to define a difference between ewar optimal (mid) and falloff (long), or bonused long range weapons. i choose 75km to pick a well rounded figure. it's not exact science, but a cut-off point shared by recon optimals, heavy missiles, long range medium turrets on unbonused ships and drone control ranges (among other). they are not cut at 75km, but they are all topped off around that range. it's alot of effects.in short, you shouldn't class your crusader based on how it act against a taranis, you should class it based on how it operates in context to any ship or the sum of all."
3/7/2010,"i need to briefly touch on this as well:you never are though, that's the problem. i've reiterated that several times in threads on ships and modules. you do not magically appear 130km apart, and your ship have no means of it's own to establish and maintain that range. you can't balance ships around the notion that you have a bookmark your opponent do not, or that you have a sling providing you warp-ins while your opponent is not allowed the same.you see that alot today when snipers fight each other. gang a gain a warp-in on gang b, who responds with warping off and warping back in on gang a at their own optimals, who respond again by escaping and re-engaging at their preferred range. that's why you can never assume an ""amazing 130km range advantage"".what you can assume is that the game provide natural warp-points up to 100km (which is why 100km has become such an important figure for sniper hacs). any range beyond that is determined and dictated by tactical measures anyone can have, as opposed to an advantage on turret reach.a big gang of eagles are no more effective against sniper hacs than a big gang of sniper bs. sniper bs have a 1/3 range advantage with a 150km standard versus a 100km standard, but they have little to no means to establish and maintain that range. sniper hacs are effective in how they can establish (100km celestial warp-in) and often maintain their optimals on their own (by being relatively [above average] fast ships), and trap other ships in those uniform ranges (on gates, stations etc.) that you wish to veer away perspective from. obviously, i don't want to represent some sort of stale idea that ranges are absolute. there is merit to bracketing though as long as the game itself use bracketing (by bracket celestial warp-points, and station/gate mechanics etc). that's also why sniper bs are not extremely effective against sniper hacs, and tend to fight to a stalemate rather than a decisive win. that's also why the thorium eagle is the 'best' eagle, and spike eagles are relegated to a nische - twice the damage at half the range (on a range you can control), is better than half the damage at twice the range (on a range that you can't control). it's easy to forget that one of the strongest assets of fighting around 100km, is that you can't be warped to from the killzone (eg., a gate) even if tackle and bubbles fail."
3/7/2010,"most of the threads which ask for a single button to be moved do not get much attention and do not get picked up. however, they can make out life a lot simpler by making better, more intuitive ui, not miss clicking and trashing our faction battleship with 20 billion worth of goodies, or selling off the mission loot with a single click of a button instead of spending 10 minutes selling every single type of sensor booster for 10 isk each.drone ui revamp: has been asked for for a long time: add shortcut key to launch drones, with a different shortcut for each drone group.we want to see drone hp in bay. we want better management of drone groups. we want more aggression options. e.g. attack anyone engaging fleet members, attack anyone engaging me, e.t.c. make it possible to sort the local channel by standings / security status. right click => insure ship.make access to api data configurable.add a subscription timerselect multiple items, right click => sell all stupid trash and self destruct buttons need to be moved.(the most prequently submitted proposal in history of eve) make afterburners red. cannot find the thread, but they will be easier to distinguish.when a module is being overloaded, make the button above module toggle red to make it more visible.when you are being webbed, make the speed bar go yellow, if you are scrammed, make it go red. give ewar it's own column in the overview - so you can actually place it somewhere where it wont be overlayed on some random text below. add a multiplier to the e-war, so when i put my mouse over a webbing icon, and ""2x"" comes up, that would mean he has two webbers on me. add nos/neut to the overview.configurable ranges for orbit, keep at range, warp at/to (at least withing 100 km)look at being limited to 100km for no reason.report button should only show up in local, npc corps, and default channels (e.g. rookie help, trade). i do not need to report my corpmates and fleetmembers as isk spammers.""buy all"" option in item purchase, and in the fitting screen.remove avatars from local channel option, so more people fitlet us invite people to language channels (why is this not possible???)right click + ctrl => unlock"
3/7/2010,"add to tactical overview, it can be switched on and off and makes sense."
3/7/2010,*bump*
3/7/2010,i thought this was in before i started playing already
3/7/2010,no to dumbing down eve and playing into the hands of those who would automate it.make the system map orientation correspond to normal-space like it used to before ccp started breaking stuff and aligning to bookmarks becomes a cinch while requiring actual player sentience.
3/7/2010,this would be very handy.
3/7/2010,1
3/7/2010,yep
3/7/2010,it never was a problem for me but it makes sense.
3/7/2010,"izen; you mean the option to choose between a sloppy and accurate sound picture :-) or was it mute since irl space is soundless. thank you cyberghost for this detailed post covering most of these non rewarding sound issues. i must say its easy for me to recognize most of these sound bugs you mention during gameplay. wonder why ccp haven't got the same priority for the sound engine compared to efforts applied to the graphic content. its a major fail to underestimate sound quality/picture/track, something developers learned back in the late eighties. you can enjoy the radio, but mtv on mute/cracking on & off doesn't rock.great idea to use csm for this approach, hope it will shake em up !"
3/7/2010,amazing!
3/7/2010,"i feel there's been a lot more value added to the original thread since this was first posted: 1. crunched the numbers of damage vs. smaller ships with the tracking boost (very little effect on cruisers and below),2. the affect of removal of the megathrons tracking bonus on railgun use (no effect vs. correct sized targets) 3. addition of an inertia 'drawback' to accompany the ab bonuses (enhanced straight line speed at expense of turn rate)oh and, supported"
3/7/2010,"killmail and loot denial is a valid form of counter-intelligence and should still be possible.if self destructing really is such a problem, then how about this: when a ship activates self destruct, all modules go offline (because the crew members who normally keep them operating are running for the escape pods)? this still makes self destruct an option, but it gives the attackers a better chance of killing the target before the timer ticks down."
3/7/2010,"those alternatives, no.the first set is excellent. ccp can make selfdestructs spit out a shiploss kmail with nullattackers right? like npc losses, but a different/additional placeholder.victim blows loot, gets his insurance[ real imba issue: suicide ganks in hisec pay insurance to criminal flags], attackers get to link to him blowing up his ship. their names and selfdestruct order on mail.can't penalize a person who has decided to go down fighting. it's be like a kamikaze pilot bring less gas on his plane knowing he is going to simply aim it at some enemy and ram it. not logical. if he kills the attackers he should be able to cancel his selfdestruct just like any rational combatant.scorched earth policy is a legitimate total war policy. if eve is a sandbox, it cannot be denied. if it is denied, this is closer to hello kitty online.problem solved. carry on about your day."
3/7/2010,if implemented there would have to be a way to prevent corp and alliance taxes to summing to more than 100%. perhaps have the alliance take a chunk of corp taxes.
3/7/2010,"i see a problem with this idea: it will tax again the same people that are taxed at corporation level and not tax the same people that avoid the tax at the corporation level.if it was something like a per head tax levered on the corp wallet it would probably be more balanced, as the corp would then see that the member give some for of contribution (work or isk or whatever they want) worth his presence in the corporation. so, supported as a general idea, not as a percentage of the npc rewards and bounties as for the corp tax."
3/7/2010,"there should be an option to flag people as scammers. it should make their chat names grey and then red over time based on the number of people flagging them to give fair warning to other players and reduce the effectiveness of scams. i understand the difference between scammers and good business is debatable, but i feel this would be a deterrent for many.thoughts?"
3/7/2010,enable your brain before clicking accept.
3/7/2010,"well, that could be missused alot. if you make a lot of money out of scamming you probably would not like to stand out from the crowd by being red. solution? flag everyone else as scammers. if you and your corpmates flag random people as scammers then you really can't be singled out anymore. and it would turn into a mechanic that tells you if someone has been in jita.and you really can't expect ccp to enforce a ""unjust"" scammer flag. and even if they did, what really is a scam is probably a personal experience. i mean if someone who haven't been playing for a year pops in and sell their t3 modules to a price they thought were resonable a year ago - they would probably be called a scammer today.although i would appeciate a working ""report scammer"", since jita local is a *****. i can't see how it is supposed to be done though. reporting of isk sellers work because it's such a blatant breach of the eula and that there is a hint that misuse will lead to ban. while begging, lies and deciet might be immoral (by some standards) - it's within the laws of the game.read before you click."
3/7/2010,"support, a thousand times"
3/7/2010,this annoyed me again today. where can i find out what's being discussed at the next csm meeting (or however this works)?-liang
3/7/2010,"what's the problem? create a courier contract with your buyer or whomever, put down the agreed price as collateral.then get the buyer or whomever to fail the contract. problem solved .. somewhat messy though even works with armor/hull damage."
3/7/2010,supported. i had an issue with firesaling my amarr ships when i found out my corp was kicked from this 0.0 alliance. i was stuck in a station without services and a bunch of amarr ships with damaged crystals.i petitioned it and a gm moved the crystals for me. i see no reason why this shouldn't be fixed.
3/7/2010,"supported, thrice times over. the number of times i've recovered t2 crystals from someone's wreck, thought ooh- these are valuable, and then kicked myself two hours later when selling the loot is just- yeah- well. +1"

3/7/2010,"read this first.my proposal is that a player can not interact with planets unless they are in a player made corporation. this will open up the option to war dec your competition. also i don't want to see a bunch of ****ing macro-planet-*****-stupid-jerks messing up this feature as well. that is unless they can be pew pewed at.having it for player made corporations will also breath new life into merc corps for hire and such.support this proposal and say ""no!!!"" to macro planet mining."
3/7/2010,"sounds like a good idea.this could also prevent mass trials/alts from annoying serious players.also, i pray to god that ccp doesn't dispute the planets in the same way moons are, having regions who are just ""better"".having systems that are better is fine, but all regions should be ""balanced"", in therms of isk-generation.that means no region-who-gives-1000-times-more-isk than the others, ccp!"
3/7/2010,supporting my proposal.
3/7/2010,"obviously a sensible idea.in fact i'd go one further: ""owning"" an empire planet automatically enrolls you in faction warfare (so if you're not in a player corp, you're enrolled in to the npc fw corp). makes sense, if you think about it for a moment. pod pilots can't plausibly claim to be seperated from the factions while running planets belonging to those factions."
3/7/2010,"no.if you read the article, you'd know that you can't ""claim"" planets*.the planets resources is split amongst everyone who choses to settle down on it.* = 0.0 may be different in this regard, but this is probably more due to sov"
3/7/2010,"no.stop trying to make ""mob playing"" mandatory.as thing are at this point you run some industry on a planet, you don't own it.and malc, in wwii ford industries in germany were running full tilt (producing machines used by the german army) and the profit were sent to the usa shareholders through swizerland. so nothing stop you from owning a factory working in enemy territory. for all of you pew pew obsessed, there is pvp in this as more people work the same planet the less efficient your production became, i.e. it is more similar to market pvp than combat pvp, but the pvp part is there. we should still see how it is implement, but don't try to impose your one side vision."
3/7/2010,yes dont **** up this with macro monkey ****... anders fogh needs to be sentenced for was crimes... also marlona sky for leader of my death cult
3/7/2010,i don't think it should put you in faction warfare. player made corp is enough in my opinion.
3/7/2010,"very good point! the more ways to encourage ppl to leave npc corps, the better!"
3/7/2010,"whoa, this fix does not even that much new coding... people assume they'd have to force a minigame into the laser, but that is not the case. only better, if the roids stopped gunfire/missiles so miner could evade in the field of them. as they might want to ninjamine lowsec/nullsec...i don't mine, ever since i learned there are not heavy mining drones of any kind.[former vexorbarge, thanny owner lol]. but i'd mine just for the mining tournies i could start."

3/7/2010,"seems like a genuinely good idea, lets see what the dev feedback to csm is before we speculating.supported for the purposes of getting feedback."
3/7/2010,and we have a winner. this is exactly why ccp hasn't made it a passive unit.
3/7/2010,nope. there is a really old thread that ccp said why it has to be (or had to be when they put it in or whatever) an active module. can't find the original thread though.
3/7/2010,then pirates shouldn't get a module for seeing a person's implants. why should pirates get that information when pods are at the mercy of popping even if they pay the ransom?
3/7/2010,[quoteit should not be allowed in high security space and can be used only by pilots with -10 ss.wut? and people can seriously support that (or are they all trolling?)how about this idea then: warp scramblers and disruptors can only be used by pilots with +5 ss.
3/7/2010,supported though tbh i'd be happy if i could just move it out of the bloody middle of the screen.
3/7/2010,and switchable offable!
3/7/2010,easiest way to say this is using a rp linecurrent concord rules state that any expidition into or thru a wormhole is a violation of law and therefore anyone who is caught going into a wormhole is subject to fines and or ship destruction. the reason everyone isn't blown out of the sky when they jump into and out of a hole is that your ship becon stops transmitting just as if your ship cloaks or goes offline. so responding to every case of a ship going off grid would not be possible.in short going to w-space is illeagal why the heck would concord then grant you sov for breaking the law
3/7/2010,"i'm saddened to see that learning skills have not been brought up. given, they have been brought up many, many times before but a solution was never implemented by ccp.the learning skill design must be one of the oldest, if not the oldest wart of eve and it is well time the problem is addressed.other then that, awesome csm representation. i especially like the proposed remedy for the so called ""docking games""."
3/7/2010,"already read them before, but here is my commentary since you asked for it: i am slightly disappointed that multiple small ui changes that request swapping buttons around and etc. where not requested. they are fairly minor, but they make a difference. i am glad battle recorder and more meaningful null-sec warfare, especially for small gangs, was mentioned, as well as extreme abundance of not valuable npc's. i support csm in pushing the warp-scrambling ships not docking. this is a very good thing in my opinion, as it would stop all the lame station games once and for all. feel free in doing the same for gates, then people will actually think. maybe in this case we could even get rid of aggro timers (or maybe we should not) black ops- yes, warfare links-yes. destroyers- finally. we really need to force ccp to redo starbases one day. it has to be done, maybe not today, but it has to. mercenary corporations should post corp logos? ofcource!corp bookmarks? hell yes! more involvement in development proses is absolutely necessary, currently csm acts more as filter of ideas from assembly hall to ccp, instead of being really involved in the development proses. and yes, it would be nice to know what happened to the issues brought up by previous csm. line that seperates forum post from signature?? will this happen?? \i am glad that these issues have been brought up, but i would, as most of the csm candidates, like to know what happens to these issues after this. thank you for mentioning the role system. i would like to see the prioritized list discussed, or at least published. i would like minor ui improvements that have been suggested (trash button, windows closing on double-click, so on) to be there, as such things need very little development time, and are very important. in general i got positive impression and am hopeful."
3/7/2010,"except that there's hardly a consensus for any ""solution"", or even a consensus that there's a problem."
3/7/2010,"most macros (i have extensive ganking experience) use active shield tanks instead of setting their drones to auto-aggress. thus, if there's weak warp scrambling rats the macros won't be able to get away since they have nothing that damages anything. the rats need to be weak enough to not give new players too much trouble ratting."
3/7/2010,"yeah, another ""let me gank people with even less hassles"" thread, nice one."
3/7/2010,"because macros can mine/rat independently, but launching drones would be too hard to add to them?"

3/8/2010,see csm minutes :)
3/8/2010,the csm minutes didn't really give any info.
3/8/2010,i think i supported this a while back but anyways support!
3/8/2010,those who say that 15% will make railguns overpowered. just know this. lasers don't need to reload or wait 10 seconds to swap ammo! so the railgun's actual realistic dps is still less than lasers.
3/8/2010,i have played gallente/caldari for over 3 years but i am retraining amarr because of terrible close in options and pathetic rail dps + cap use. as long as i'm using cap i might as well not use ammo.
3/8/2010,"what a well formulated argument for the problem we're not talking about. i've said it before and i'll say it again, between the lock limit and high damage on lasers allowing their falloff to compete with railgun optimals there is no '130km' as you illustrate it. theany point you're talking about exists, and even then only maginally beyond the lock limit and are therefore completely irrelevent to the game. this theory also ignores the fact that at any range you can at least try to shoot at the enemy, if your max optimal is 100km 130km may still be within your falloff and if you do 2x+ the damage you can still -beat- the longer ranged weapons system at it's own range.being the 'ranged' weapon of choice means that at your optimal, beyond the optimal of other weapons systems, you do more damage then others by a fair margin, this isn't currently the case and this imbalance has rendered the sniping vessels of two races impotant as a result."
3/8/2010,"railguns need some looking into, one quite big issue with fleets is that the railgun ammo takes much space and they fire rapidly -> mega's run out of ammo quite fast. having the biggest m^3 ammo consumption and also needing cap to fire is a major drawback.and in today's eve minnies with arties make better snipers than the rails on gallente ships (rokh is a special case) and rails are supposed to be the sniper weapons of choice..."
3/8/2010,"i disagree with that. if you're at 170-190km, the enemy sniper bses can return fire. if you're at 230km, only their rokhs can. the range bonus either lets you take a massive reduction in return fire, or use faction ammo at standard ranges for 400% of ""normal"" tracking should you wish.ship utilisation only tells you about which ships are being used. while desirability plays some part in this, it is in no way divorced from many external factors affecting this choice too.most importantly, a lot of eve ship fitting revolves around group mentality. many fits have become popular only after someone tried something which was unconventional at the time, and then others noticed it worked and started using it too. concepts such as nano ships, dualprop, (ham) drakes as pvp ships, nano rupture etc. were all at one point regarded as strange if not outright lolfits (crucially even at such times that game mechanics made them just as viable as they are now).my point is that what people fly is often very conservative and based on common opinion. that an option is not being used, does not mean such as option does not exist.i take your point - but i don't know if your assumption is a valid one. dual reps are roughly equivalent to shield booster + amp in terms of performance per slots. but who's to say the ships were balanced around the expectation of fitting dual reps, rather than armor reps having more cap efficiency with a lower rep amount?it's basically impossible to say either way, but do i find it unlikely that reps/appropriately-sized plates were always expected to be fitted in pairs else they would simply be more effective. you could always downgrade to a smaller (doubled-in-performance) rep if fitting issues, or a hybrid tank, were reasons not to do this.in fact this is a good example of what i consider to be an escalation in expectations. don't get me wrong, i agree that you need to go oversized buffer or dual-rep due to today's metagame. however, i don't believe the ships are originally designed to be fit as such, and while it's fine that people are doing this i think they overlook that they're already pushing the ship's capabilities, because that's become their baseline."
3/8/2010,"i agree with the first point, but i don't think the next three tally that well with your characterisation of range, which is a good indication of why i don't think the classification is legitimate:at what range do i tend to be forced to commit to stay if i engage?if you're in the faster ship, then the answer is the same as the first question. if you're at, say, 15km and decide you want to leave, then you can burn out of point range and warp. the amount of incoming damage (tracking-modified) vs. your ehp vs. the speed differences will determine how quickly you can leave point range though, so operating from 22km is going to be safer than 15km in that you can disengage quicker should the need arise.if you're in the slower ship, and they want you to stay, then this is point range. (but then if you're the slower ship and choose to engage, you'll almost certainly be wanting to go straight for the web-scram to stop the other ship disengaging).- at what range do i tend to be able to disengage and escape?essentially the inverse of the above question, likewise for the answers.- at what range do i tend to avoid the majority of damage and effects?now this is where i think your classification of ranges is too simplistic, because the answer is simply it depends. against a taranis, the answer is about 10km. against a rokh, the answer is 250km. against other ships, it's somewhere in between.critically, most small and medium ships (certainly those used for solo/small-gang pvp) have little ability to project damage much beyond point range, so in that case engaging at 40km, say, will make you nigh-on unhittable. (this is actually pretty relevant in the case of stealth bombers, for example). battleships (except for blasters and torps) can typically hit reasonably well to that range, but if you get 60km out you're usually safe again.as another example, an ambit-rigged hurricane would murder a brutix because even at 20km he'd be taking no damage. on the other hand, a harbinger would track and hit just fine.one question that i think is missing from the above, is:what range do i have to operate at to stop the other guy from disengaging?the answer is pretty obvious, but the (typically) 24km ceiling when soloing is very relevant to a lot of ships and setups.i agree entirely - and because the sum of all ships have such different engagement ranges, i don't think there's any value in generalised range brackets. typically, asides from point/web ranges it's weapon ranges you're concerned with, and with the number of weapons systems and tiers and ship bonuses and tes/tcs/locii/ambits (and to a lesser extent, pilot skills) just about any range is a cut-off for something, and there's no reason to choose one over another in a global context.i think there would be a lot more value in doing this for a given situation - e.g. ""going up against a hypothetical gang of sniper zealots, brutices, eagles and megas - the brutix has a 70km optimal, the zealot has 100km, the eagles and mega have 150km."" that way the range differences can be legitimately used to compare performance and damage mitigation in a particular situation."
3/8/2010,"true, but you're not magically at 95km, either. the engagement happens at whatever range the aggressors warp to the other party. if you're choosing the fight then you get to choose the range you warp in at, otherwise you don't.even if you're on the back foot, being able to return fire against eagles landing 130km away is much better than not being able to.well no, i'm not assuming that. but i am saying that your ""preferred range"" is outside the range at which the other gang can return fire, while you can still hit them at theirs.anyway, not having taken part in fleet sniper fights, surely the point is to prevent the other gang from warping around like this by bubbling them? if you don't tackle them, i don't see how they're meant to stick around in an unfavourable situation (and you definitely want to make it an unfavourable situation for them.besides, as you've said - if they warp out and back to you at 95km, you can just warp out and back in at your preferred range. i grant that 100km does have some importance because of being able to warp that far from a warpable point. however, unless the targets are sitting directly on a celestial, you'd need a covops/inty to get your a warpin anyway, at which point they can position themselves 30km closer to you, for a 130km warp-in.and if we're talking about battleships and the utility of the rokh's range advantage, this point has no merit since bses will need to have specially established warp-ins anyway - at which point it is just as feasible to establish a 250km warp-in as it is a 180km one.true, to some extent - but the eagles are still sniper hacs as well as having battleship-sniper range. they have agility to get into warp quickly, cruiser-class mwd speed (even though pretty slow-ish) and the tracking of medium-sized guns.and the ability to choose between the two (even with a ten second ammo change) is greater yet. though i don't see why you can control a 100km range but not a 200km range...good point, but the same still holds for e.g. 130km sniping (with a smaller ""buffer"")."
3/8/2010,"falloff on heavy beams is 19km, with three tes. going 35km beyond optimal they'll hence be hitting about 9.5% of the time. i can assure you that railguns do more than 9.5% of the raw damage of lasers. that's definitely not true for small or medium turrets, and i was lead to believe that the standard range for bs snipers was 150-180km? a rokh has a >250km (with spike) with just 2 tes; a 3te megathron firing at this range would have a 39% chance to hit, with an expectation of 31.4% of its raw dps.it doesn't ignore that at all - it's just that damage degrades in falloff possibly faster that you'd expect. even if you're doing double the raw damage of another ship (and we're seeing nothing like that discrepancy here), you'd still be doing less damage at your optimal+falloff.so yes, if the longer-ranged weapons system was doing half the damage for a bit more range (less than your own falloff), you would have a point. however, that's not the case; looking at the raw stats, railguns do ~9% less damage for 20% more range. and more importantly, comparing actual ships you end up with greater disparities in both, with optimal bonuses skewing the crossover point even earlier.not only that, but how many sniper ships are going to give up slots to sensor boosters in order to hit beyond optimal + falloff? there's a very real chance that even if another ship could be hitting you for ~30% of base damage, they won't even be able to lock you in practice.that's a ridiculous claim, what is it about ""your"" optimal that makes it special? if your second clause is taken to mean anything, then it requires that only the longest-range weapon system could be the ""ranged weapon of choice"", since otherwise it's not beyond the optimal of other weapons systems. hence railguns win regardless. or if we ignore the clause, then neutron blasters win. it's simply about having the best range of situations that you can come out on top in. having extra range is an advantage in that it lets you engage from many more positions (and outside the range of many other weapons systems), though this is useless if you don't use it. the real kicker is having the best combination of damage and tracking for the situations in which you do engage, and i have seen nothing that shows railguns are not competitive in this regard with other long-range turrets."
3/8/2010,"gartel reiman you missing many flaws of railships, therefor your conclusions are wrong.also your theory about fleet battles are flawed aswell.just be in some of them and try to answer your questions about why they are not working as you imagined.then you will get where you are wrong and why railships are bad.railships dont have any advantage over beam or arty ships,slightly better optimal isnt enough to compensate the huge list of disadvantages."
3/8/2010,"now please tell me what those flaws are?.don't just say he have flaws in his post without telling what the flaws is.but yeah, i agree that railguns need a little boost / tweak in something, but i'm not really sure on what is needed to be boosted / tweaked yet though."
3/8/2010,"did i just read someone compare chance to hit and dps as if they were somehow the same, or could be used to offset the other?if you have a 9.5% chance to hit and 100 dps, it is not the same, or comprable as an 18% chance to hit and 30 dps... you have to factor in rof, ehp of the target.. so many things.it may seem obvious but to some it's not apparently."
3/8/2010,"so you presume that your fleet is comprised only of rokhs. false premise.apoc aurora l: 372 @ 193+33 tracking 0.00524, rokh cn tungsten: 323 @ 197+49 or cn iridium: 287 @ 168+ 49 tracking 0.01202. false premise, wrong numbers, strawman argument.law of large numbers and statistics disagree with you. if you amass a fleet, the composition will be influenced by the majority. the majority follows the performance/isk rule. false on this count as well. data and numbers tell the truth, stop trying to pass white as black.there is an upper ceiling to the ships' capabilities, and that is what we are asking to be to modified. if i or anyone else can reach that ceiling, is totally different.we are not dictating fittings, we are indicating design shortcomings. don't mix these too up.you are doing this backwards. what is your performance criterion for that situation you described? whether or not each ship can reach the target? false methodology.a realistic tactical situation is: we warp in @ 100 from gate and engage. which ship will be able to deliver more damage to the target?"
3/8/2010,"sorry to bring this up, but shouldn't you listen to the opinion of people that have taken part in numerous fleet bs fights, sniperhac roams, etc? i believe that there is an expression used by field personnel for those guys that try to argue vs experience using unfounded theories. don't just theorize, measure and analyze the relevant data.see above.qft"
3/8/2010,"200km is more common, you see a lot of bob fits fall around that area and it seems you haven't met the new sniper on the block, the apoc which can get up to 230km putting a rokh's 249+ optimal well within reach. also comparing a megathron to a rokh is 100% absurd since they're both saddled with the same poor weapons system and the rokh's bonuses should make it the primiere sniper in the game, compare it to a snipe apoc if you want to be serious.i've based all my stats and conclusions off the idea that you do around 50% damage at the end of the first cycle of falloff, which you seem to agree is the case later in your post, you seem to underestimate just how large the falloff margins are next to the differences in range.i'm not sure what stats you're looking at but here's what i know, based on the sniper battleship situation comparion rokh to apoc.apoc gets 25% more damage for 8% less range then the rokh, more conservative setups will lead to a 17% difference in range, with a falloff of 41-44km which means an apoc can still do 340 dps at the rokh's optimal or 180 with a more conservative setup where the rokh is stuck at 320 dps.this is based off both setups with 3 damage mods and 2/3 tracking enhancers, 2/3 sensor boosters and 8x 425mm rails/tachyon lasers. fitting this as well as a mwd on an apoc isn't easy of course but with the right rigs you can manage it and get a ship that's unambiguously better then the rokh at any range."
3/8/2010,"this is a laughable argument and complete misunderstanding of how things work and what i said, so i'll explain again. what's special about 'your' optimal is that it is the optimal range of your weapons system with spike/aurora, in short it's the best damage you're going to be doing within 80km in either direction. if another weapons system is fighting at that range while having different optimals then you should expect to do more damage. likewise if you try to fight the enemy at their optimal you expect them to do more damage to you. what this means, and what you're repeatedly failed to understand is that without a damage advantage at your optimal having a longer optimal is useless because you will be outpreformed or near-matched by the falloff of higher damage lower ranged systems.most weapons systems have a damage advantage at their optimal, blasters do, pulse lasers do, beam lasers do and rails either don't or have such a marginal advantage as to not matter at all.damagedamage vs shieldsdamage vs armor"

3/8/2010,"greetings,my proposal is simple enough and mostly related to a lot of what i've encountered in whiskey space. simply that with dreads being so large seiging of pos's in wh space/ high sec can be extremly difficult. it is far to easy to defend against anything short of a 30+ man bs fleet attacking a pos. which essentially makes wh, and high sec pos's invincible to anything but large blob attacks (unless of course the pos is ignored by the owner).my proposal is simply to create either modules with horrible tracking for bs size ships essentially only capable of hitting a pos sized object. or to create a secondary ship class of lower skill requiring glass cannons so to speak who's primary role would only be to seige large targets. obviously they would not module or ship wise be as powerful as something like a dread, but would at least be powerful enough to make seige of pos's in whiskey space and high sec more viable and less time consuming."

3/8/2010,"the latest eve quarterly economic newsletter showed the dominance of jita in trade is growing.table 4: the top 10 highest population systems in eve, in terms of characters on active paying accounts excluding characters currentlyflying either a rookie ship or capsule.table 5: relative share of regions in total trade value.have all those ships in one place, jita, increases the risk overloading the node/grid. it's currently better than it has been in the past but continued growth will increase the likeliness of it returning/deteriorating one day.that dominance is derived from the large number of stations and services available in jita compared to the other faction hubs. action needs to be taken to balance the level of trade amongst trade hubs. if jita was just nerfed like yulai, another hub will just be created. instead a strategy is needed that promotes a diffusion of trade. a levelling process. therefore instead of nerfing jita, trade needs to supported and promoted in the other faction hubs.(some of these proposal also presents a good opportunity for in game news events)add stations & services to existing station in or near the other faction hubs, trade is built on production, that means factories, labs station, officers and hangers. players are attracted by agents, so add agents in or near, one of each level. medical services would allow plays to jc visit a hub without flying a ship in. (c.f. the network effect)from an rp perspective it's a bit silly that gallente are compelled to travel to jita to trade, less of a problem but equally silly in minmatar travelling to domain to trade. trading with the enemy should be made more difficult, trading with allies should be made easier. (free trade is good in real life but sucks for flavour is a war scenario) introduce a new tax, import tariff that is increased with negative faction standing. new unaligned pilots could trade relatively freely, align pilots would trade cheaply in their own faction space and less cheaply in enemy faction space.make the travel routes between allies slightly shorter and the travel routes between enemy hubs a little longer. make trade more bi-lateral rather than quad-lateral.oursulaert further from jita.jita closer to amarr.amarr further from rens.rens closer to oursulaert.ensure the overall travel distance in jumps remains the same/similar.jita <-> amarr is the same/similar as rens <-> oursulaert jita <-> oursulaert is same/similar as rens <-> amarr."
3/8/2010,"nice, thread - if only you knew what you are talking about !first btw - comon flame him boys ! :)"
3/8/2010,"*facepalms*1. trading in jita is done to 99.99999% in one station (4-4 caldari navy assembly plant). the other stations are mostly unused.2. you already pay more tax and broker fee for bad standing. given the volume that can be quite a lot of extra costs.3. jita isnt the major trade hub because ccp made it that way. players created it.and you know why it it is the major trade hub? because people move all their stuff there to trade it.the regional trade hubs get close to it, but dont really reach the volume.you really dont know what you were talking about."
3/8/2010,"the trade at 4-4 is supported by production from numerous factories, labs and mining operations in and around jita.wrong. tax is limited by accounting skill, standing has no effect. broker fee is marginally by corporation standing and faction standing. this is clearly not enough to discourage trading with the enemy, which is frankly silly.eve is a sandbox governed by the rules and toys ccp provide, the jita effect was inevitable and was even called the yulai effect when that was the number 1 hub.the faction trade hubs are not even close to jita, if you had been bothered to read the qen you would see the figures speak for themselves. jita 53%, domain 8.9%."
3/8/2010,come back when you know what you are talking about.
3/8/2010,this!in answer to your other thread:1) no2) not applicable
3/8/2010,"touche. a minor error now corrected that doesn't change the fundamental point. it is so small it doesn't discourage trading with the enemy which is silly.and no i won't stop posting because somebody tells me to, only when somebody provide a cohesive argument why the proposal is wrong, a single line troll isn't that. this is supposed to be a discussion."
3/8/2010,"by definition of the network effect, the majority of the trade volume will clump up in one convenient location, regardless of any attempts to distribute trading volumes more evenly.thus trying nerf jita and all that rabble is a moot point.not supported."
3/8/2010,"if it was larger, the most that you could expect is that people would use alts to avoid it."
3/8/2010,i would still think that the location is more important than the stations around.e.g. dodixie got a hub because of the good lvl4 agent and the relatively close position to the jita -> hek pipe.rens mostlikely got a hub because it is relatively close to amamake.amarr is pretty close (5-6jumps) to many lowsec entries.
3/8/2010,trade hubs are created by players.you go to place a buy/sell order at any station you can dock at and there fore you are commencing trade.therefore... you don't know what the hell your talking about.ccp can't do nothing about this... people just need to get used to doing business somewhere else.
3/8/2010,"only true when each path is equally weighted. there increasing the lengths of some routes and the value of some nodes will diffuse the network.perhaps you should read up on opportunity cost and barriers to entry.there are plenty of things ccp can do to shape the environment and influence player decisions on this matter, the question is which of these many things are the most appropriate.to name a few, i don't like them all but they would work.docking queues at congested stations.increase in exploration sites in quiet systems.more rats in quiet systems.congestion charge based on how busy the system, constellation and region are, applied to factory & lab charges, broker fees, office & hanger rent.agents in busy systems have fewer missions and occasionally make you wait, or send you away to run x number missions for my college in quiet station z.agents in quiet systems pay increased bonus or lp to entice pilots in to work for them."
3/8/2010,yes a lot of people run missions in jita or plexes.

3/8/2010,"jita is fine. in fact it's so fine that it's a product of the multiplayer sandbox manifesting itself.also adding arbitrary and pointless limits wouldn't help anything, traders don't have to be in jita to trade in jita or have you never looked at the trade skills tree?no one is compelled to go to jita to trade in the slightest. but because it's so big and so competitive it often has the best prices for buying and the quickest sells. a player can do just fine in other hubs both with trading or outfitting ships.really you haven't even given a decent argument that there is a problem in the first place why should we even bother to consider changing it?"

3/8/2010,"considering that all the important parts of the eve interface are as far apart from each other as possible, to make the use of the latter as uncomfortable as possible, yes i agree!a ui overhaul is desperately needed, a few hotkeys won't do."

3/8/2010,iirc so was fleet warfare yet it got mentioned again. i hate to think what ccp's rebalancing pile must look like but i get the feeling af's in general and rockets in particular are going mouldy near the bottom of said pile.it would be nice to see someone give them a prod.
3/8/2010,those are my biggest concerns about increasing the terms to 1 year. one advantage is that you would have a longer streak of attendance since you have 2 summits. it is also why i recommended that the terms start with the winter elections. that way you only have 2 months after the fanfest summit before the new csm term starts. people who are burnt out will not put themselves up for election and even if they stop showing you only have a 2 month lame duck period to shuffle though. i would assume a chunk of that would be put towards setting things up for the next csm term anyway.
3/9/2010,then i suggest you read them again =p unless of course you want to know exactly how they wil be fixed - but i doubt even ccp knows that at this time.

3/9/2010,"no, i presume the squad of rokhs is composed solely of rokhs. the other guys warp to ""normal"" sniper optimal, but your rokhs can operate from beyond that.well, you've put some tracking mods on the apoc and none on the rokh in that comparison. but anyway, rokh's cn tungsten tracking is 0.01202 while it's tracking with spike is 0.00301, so the faction ammo is tracking four times as well as ""normal"" (i.e. long-range t2 ammo).beams do track better than railguns natively, though. the 44% better base tracking of tachyons than 425s (or 59% better with megabeams) is possibly a more valid issue than the damage/range debate, possibly not depending on the intended engagement envelopes.yes, data and numbers tell the truth, and the truth is simply that more megas etc. are used in large fleet engagements.data and numbers don't pass any judgement on the raw facts; any interpretation as to ""why"" is subjective and not backed up by the data. you're claiming more people fly megas because rokhs are inferior; i'm claiming more people fly megas because of their trained skills, alliance fit & reimbursement policies and fc tactics (it's easier to try to make all ships fungible so you just need to think about ""sniper bses"" rather than to manage different types accordingly).in particular i don't agree that when you amass a fleet the composition will be influenced by the majority. rather the composition is influenced by the long-term dictates of the alliance policies (coming from the few leaders) and the immediate requests/demands of the fleet's fc. your individual pilot doesn't get much chance to be a snowflake.it's simply a question of whether what you're asking for is in-line with the concept of the ship. some would say that e.g. a thorax could get 15% damage per level and still fit within the intended performance bracket, others wouldn't. it's simply an issue of what that bracket is intended to be for a given ship.in that exact situation, it's the one that does the most damage at 100km, quite simply. as i said above, if you're not expecting return fire, you simply want the highest damage at ranges outside of the enemy's optimal. that situation makes any range above 100km dubious. other situations would not."
3/9/2010,"of course, and that's broadly what i'm basing my assessments on. don't get me wrong, i'm not saying ""i'm right and here's why""; i'm pointing out that i haven't been convinced by your arguments so far and am explaining why, based on my knowledge.exactly. if your proposal is valid, then it shouldn't rely on ""just knowing"" from experience, it should be presentable purely in the abstract based on the actual numbers and figures. of course, there needs to be some interpretation (e.g. how likely is it that you can get a bubble on an enemy fleet, get a 6-second warpin going on etc.) but that only really effects which numerically-backed situations are valid - not the validity of each individual sub-conclusion.ability to warp to your gang? i'm afraid i don't get which part of ""above"" (we've generated quite a lot of it ) you're referring to.well, it wasn't comparing dps and falloff, so much as comparing damage lost in falloff compared with extra optimal (and the equivalence or otherwise of the two). asides from the rather strange choice of figures in the example that don't really tally at all - the difference isn't that great. in fact, were it not for hit quality you'd have the same expectation of damage from 8 guns with a 50% chance to hit, or 4 guns with a 100% chance to hit. the only difference is that the former might do up to double the volley damage (which averages out by doing as little as zero damage on other volleys).(in actual fact because of hit quality being degraded by a lower chance to hit, the one in falloff will actually average around 38% of base damage rather than 50%.)unless you're shooting at a very small number of targets that you need to instapop and your combined expected volley is something like 80% of their ehp - this difference is going to be insignificant over any engagement due to the extra highs being cancelled out by the extra lows. rate of fire will only make a difference regarding the steepness of the distribution (i.e. the odds of getting a result distinct from the average over a given period of time), not the expected average damage dealt. unless you are taking a very few samples (i.e. trying to kill something in one or two volleys) this is broadly irrelevant. and the ehp only comes into the equation when it's somewhere close to your volley damage, and even then it balances out against multiple targets.so really, the important figure is the expectation, in which degree we can obviously offset base damage against falloff; the only way anything else matters is the degree of volatility you would prefer."
3/9/2010,"definitely true about the apoc. i mentioned the mega as a baseline on an understanding that it's the shortest-ranged common sniper ship. so if fcs are going for a uniform warp-in range for ships, this range has to be the lowest common denominator, which is thus what i was looking to calculate.it's 38% damage at the end of falloff, which is a notable amount less than 50%. i think you also based your arguments around one weapon having a 2x+ base damage to the other though, which is also definitely not the case.i was looking at the turrets themselves - which, i know, cannot be considered outside the context of the ships that use them, of course. however, if the raw stats compare sensibly, but the ships are out of balance, it would suggest it's the ships bonuses/slot layout/fitting that's causing the imbalance rather than the weapons systems themselves. it's a legitimate point to consider when deciding what boost (if any) to ask for.comparing equivalent setups (3 damage mods, 3 range mods), rokh has 18.6% more range and apoc has 25% more damage. rokh also has more falloff, but the locking cap means this can't be used effectively (it's already got a 274km optimal... ).two things that i do agree are unfair on the rokh here:the locking cap completely screws over the rokh here. at 300km the rokh will still do 227 dps while the apoc does 59 dps there. the fact that the rokh's optimal with two range mods is already beyond the locking cap is silly. this needs to be increased if the rokh's extra optimal is to be of any real use, other than as a pseudo-tracking bonus with cn thorium.tachyons are effectively a tier higher than megabeams, there is no direct railgun equivalent. while this makes the apoc a ***** to fit, it does make it shine in abstract comparisons like this. against megabeams, range difference is 30.5% and damage 16%"
3/9/2010,"projectile weapons never do, and they're ok right now. damage types, alpha, tracking, cap use and fitting all do come into it as well, it's not simply a game of dps numbers.having extra optimal gives you an option that the shorter-ranged guys don't have. as i noted above, the rokh gets screwed over here, because it can't use its extra optimal due to the locking range cap, whereas a tach apoc has the perfect amount of range (231+48 means it's still hitting just fine at 249, thanks). in a more general sense, though (e.g. anything with medium rails) this concept still holds.even with falloff perhaps letting the other guy hit you at your optimal, this just blue-shifts the ranges. you can go a little bit into your own falloff (against lasers especially, not so much against arties) and they lose a lot more damage against a small amount for you.so in many cases, railguns do outdamage any other weapons system at their optimals, simply because the other weapons systems can't hit that far and will be well into falloff by then. apoc vs rokh is a particular case where this doesn't hold because of the locking cap.those graphs aren't accurate, primarily because they join the dots linearly. the important part in particular is the line between the last two dots on each series (i.e. optimal with t2 long-range ammo going to optimal+falloff with t2 long range).when this is fixed, it shows exactly what you say should be the case above. the beam lasers are the shorter-ranged weapon system, so by your logic should outdamage the longer-ranged rails at every point within beam range. this is true. then as soon as we go a bit past the beam's optimal range, the railguns start doing more damage consistently."
3/9/2010,"that's still a false premise because if you peruse kms, you'll see that the average number of rokhs in fleets cannot fill even a squad.i used standard fleet fits, 3x damage mods and 2x range mods on both ships.apoc is 1x te+1xtc, rokh is 2x tc. so lasers do more dps/ have better tracking @ same range and this makes my arguments not valid? i am confused here, damage delivery is reliant upon the product damage*range*tracking. if the apoc(damage as dps) and pest(damage as alpha) are superior in all three over the rokh and mega, doesn't that indicate there is a reason to boost rails?so you mean that alliances dictate individual skill plans? sorry, but we're not in boot camp. everything you just said boils down to the performance/ isk rule. if the rokh performed as well as the apoc, you'd see them on alliance reimbursement schemes. since it is under-performing, it is not. thus, people with railgun skills are forced to train for the cheaper mega, or pest, or apoc. fcs ask for fleet snipers, 170km range/ max dps/ 56k ehp (sbs are the new dd) not for shiptypes."
3/9/2010,"fair enough. examine the ships then under these premises:1) fleetbs engagement envelope is 170-190km. fleet operates as a unit and the variation in ranges falls within 20km from the warp-in the fc calls (megas and pests will warp-in @ 170, apocs and rokhs @ 190). no individual squad shenanigans.2) sniperhac engagement envelope is 70-100km. you can see in game justification for these ranges if you right click in empty space.3) ranged anti-support engagement envelope is out to 80km, meaning that their mission is to obliterate asap any enemy support that enters that sphere of influence.this is standard operational doctrine for fleets and is the basis of our comparisons. hypothetical situations that involve combat @ 250km do not happen, so there is no merit in including them to the conversation. when both mega and rokh (railboats) under-perform vs pest and apoc, then you need to look at their common trait. if their only common trait is rails, then there lies the problem.see above for operational doctrine. as i've said before, an eft number that has no in-game application at any time is of no consequence. anyway it was shown before, beams have pretty much the same range as rail for operational use. does that constitute your counter-proposal: nerf lasers?"
3/9/2010,"the megathron is outperformed by all snipers except the rokh (which has longer range). the hyperion is outperformed by the apocalypse. the rokh underperforms all other snipers in all aspects until they get into the most extreme range. at issue is simply the benefit that people talk about (extra range) really doesn't hold up. in reality, rail ships have no benefit and many penalties compared to other weapons systems in eve (lowest alpha, lowest tracking, uses cap, and uses ammo)."
3/9/2010,"i think this is the crux of our disagreement.railguns excel only at range. when there is no real benefit to range then i agree there would be no real point in choosing railguns over an alternative weapons system.you reiterate without any justification that fights at 250km (in a more general sense, fights beyond other weapons' ranges) ""do not happen"". why? what is stopping the rokhs choosing to warp in at 230km in your above situation instead of warping it at 190km?i agree that if fights at long++ ranges don't happen, then railguns will be pretty mediocre in practice indeed. but even in this case i don't think that buffing rails is the best option (because they're intended to do slightly less damage with longer ranges), but rather address the mechanics that mean their range provides no tangible advantage."
3/9/2010,"lets look from the fc's position, he has like 40% apoc,30%mega,20% tempest ,10%rokh or around this. he can use 100% of his force at 170km and 40% at 230km ,so what would he do? yeah warp the fleet to 170km as any sane person would.now look from the enemies point ,if they cant fight back,then they will warp/jump out, this way fighting from 230km holds no advantage.so lets assume that enemies can fight back ,so they can shoot at least 170km far.now lets see what rokhs would do they can warp to 170km like the rest of the fleet or to 230km to their optimal,what they will get from warping to their optimal?dps/alpha wont increase at all in some cases it will decrease if you would use lower navy ammo than iridium.enemies wouldnt attack them at that ranges ,but here is the problem they would attack the rest of the fleet,tempests/megas,then enemy dps wont decrease even a little.maybe even increse as the rokhs tend to be the best tanked sniper bs most of the time ,by moving the best tankers out of enemy range is a moronic step,no fc would do this.so from fc's view you get no advantage at all if you move your rokhs to 230km ,there is absolutely no reason to use their better optimal because it is pointless to do. especially the opposite, using rokhs as the rest of the fleet makes managing the fleet easier.therefor we can say that better optimal in sniper fleet ,than the rest of your fleet holds no advantage at all.and for fleet fight you cant make a rokh only fleet,because only a little part of your members can fly those,and training for them takes a lot of time and possibly would result with 0 advantage.and rails are used for sniper fleets,and rails better optimal is no advantage at all,it is just there but you cant use it out because your fleet doesnt consist only of rokh or eagles.oh and here comes another stupidity the resist bonuses for caldari snipers. if your tactic is to keep out from enemy range then why the hell do you want to have a tank bonus?oh and dont tell me that it is for blaster fits ,because there optimal bonus is mostly pointless to have.sum up rails :advantage: better optimal (i already pointed out why this is negated)disadvantages: small ammo clip,10sec reload,huge cap use,fixed dmg types,low alpha,hard to fit up to caldari/gallente ships,tiers scale badlyso like 0 advantage versuse many disadvantages and you ask why rails should be boosted?"
3/9/2010,"naomi did a good job describing the thought processes that justify the facts. what i want to emphasize is that the field experience we were talking about and you stated that you lack, is all the justification required to outline the operational environment we are in.so to sum it up:you: sarge, why do i need to keep my gun clean?me: cause if you don't son, it'll blow up in your face.you: i'll take good care sarge to not get it dirty, keep it out of the sand and mud on the battlefield and it will need no cleaning, right?me: son, i've seen it happen, poor sod didn't have a face afterward.you: but sarge, you haven't justified yet why i need to clean my gun!!!"
3/9/2010,"i support the damage proposal, but do not support the others.as background, i fly megathrons and occasionally rokh in 150k rr gangs quite often. my alt flies an equivalent apoc. at that range, my mega does less dmg, has less tracking (even with its bonuses!), and has less ehp than my apoc. both have poor cap. the rokh can do well in some situations (200k+ and if shield tanking is allowed), but overall its mismatched tactically.i also use sniperhacs (mostly muninn). zealot is far better than the others, with superior dps and it can also be quite nasty with pulses as well. in the bc class, the same trend is true. gal is the worst; medium rails need a big boost. the myrm bonsus don't work well and its damage is poor compared to the other bc. i have limited experience with frigate guns, and will not comment, but my limited experience leads me to believe that pretty much all ""long"" range frigate guns are irrelevant anyhow.but overall, i believe rails need a buff. i also believe several gal/caldari ships need love, especially the demios, hyperion, and myrmidon. i also call for ccp to consider nerfing some laser boats that outperform all other ships in their class, including the zealot and the apoc, with a real good look at the other amarr bs."
3/9/2010,"so in your effort to find out potential problems with a weapons system you compared two ships using said weapons system instead of against others, brilliant.eft says otherwise and don't make false claims about my arguments, they're based on the fact that you railgun optimal falls well within the first falloff of a tach apoc.[quotei was looking at the turrets themselves - which, i know, cannot be considered outside the context of the ships that use them, of course. however, if the raw stats compare sensibly, but the ships are out of balance, it would suggest it's the ships bonuses/slot layout/fitting that's causing the imbalance rather than the weapons systems themselves. it's a legitimate point to consider when deciding what boost (if any) to ask for.so what you're saying is that you examined railguns in a world without lock limits thus ignoring one of the major problems with the platform, make a new analysis that actually sees what happens when you put these things on ships, context matters.there you go you compared equivalent setups and got similar results, as you pointed out yourself much of the range advantage you quote comes to no use hence why i chose to use just two and leave optimal at 253km. also oversized or not people use tachyons and ignoring them won't make them go away, simply leave them overpowered next to other systems."

3/9/2010,let's take this one step further...why should capital ships be the only one with this feature? why not any ship with a drone bay?
3/9/2010,we're flying internet spaceships piloted via direct neural interface. surely it makes sense that such highly capable machines would be capable of performing these maneuvers at the flick of a pilot's will.well supported!

3/9/2010,"ccp is pretty ret@rded here. first off if you are developing for xbox 360 it isn't that hard to port to pc. second off, is thinking that they can make a dent in a market that is already flooded with fpses without relying on their current customers to champion their product is foolhardy. i don't own a console, and i won't buy one for the mediocre fps dust 514. just look at all the problems and bugs with eve, you know that dust won't be a polished a+ grade shooter. there will be -no- reason to buy it outside of something to do in the eve universe when not running fleet/corp ops.however, i would be willing to pay $40 (i'd laugh at 50-60) to play dust 514 on pc. but justifying $130 for a console, $65 for a year of xbox live, and then $50 for the game adds up to $245 for a game that i don't really want to play in the first place. tl;dr: there are too many good ""thoroughbred"" games out there to play dust 514 on console."
3/9/2010,"you're aware that the xbox 360 doesn't use x86 processors, right?"
3/9/2010,no
3/9/2010,"problem is not with selfdestruct existance, but in that it places no penalties on the one who initiates it.it is his right to destruct his own ship - but there also must be responsibility connected with it. but currently such responsibility doesn't exist - i can initiate and cancel selfdestruct any time i want and i will receive no penalties for either of these actions.the problem is not that he destroyed his loot, but that he (piloting the capital) can do it almost always regardless of his skills (as human being), agility or anything other - he just presses one button, and timing is not so important too (he just see that he is tackled alone).no, i don't want to bring bigger fleet, because it will generate more lag on server side and will lower pvp skill / learning of each individual pilot in my fleet.i have no objection - go on, selfdestruct in such situation. but receive no bonuses from it, such as denying enemy killmail or loot. is it fine with you?what do you mean - faster? you mean ""bring blob to kill something that can be killed with much less amount of ships""? no, thank you.no, it is not working as intended. when it was first introduced in game, there were no capital ships which can tank incredible amount of dps and so successfuly selfdestruct most of the time.also, ccp already posted somewhere (by words of csm delegate korvin) that killmail must be generated in case of s/d."
3/9/2010,"i think the only reasonable change is a minor increase in self destruct timer for caps - by 1 minute.and denial of insurance payout.but no killmails, since the whole purpose of self destruct is to deny the killmail and loot, these 2 things should not be overturned."
3/9/2010,"yes, i think that combination is reasonable and rational, but others may be too. but ccp sometimes overreact nerfs thing to the root - i don't want that to happen with selfdestruct, of course. :)"
3/9/2010,"guys, guys, think of the precious k:d ratio."
3/9/2010,"that's bull****, i only am required to bring the dps nessesary to break his tank, that is it. obviously the lest attacker should get the killmail and that's it. all self destruction should do, is deny the attacker the loot."
3/9/2010,"it won't work, and actualy it will do worse then now, as ppl will flag every person they dont like as a scammer, and scammers themself will simply flagg evryone they see to confuse everyone else.besides that, imho scamming itself isnt a problem, the amount of scamming in eve now, and scammers spamming is the problem. its about 1 year since i prefere to buy and self stuff in amarr, not an jita. all becuse there is almost none scammer spammers in amarr local, while jita local now is real trash.three solution.first, make links in chat unable to modify, so if you link raven contract, it will show raven contract, not an cnr contract. or allow them to modify while typing, but nethertheless posted unmodified. for example, i create contract for raven, set the price to 400m isk, link that contract to local channel, and then tried to modify it so it would say raven navy issue instead of raven. but then i press 'enter' to post it, and will actualy post unmodified link of raven.second solution is about same link in local, but about those who spamm the local about zydrin or mecacyte contracts. first of all same make contracts unable to modify, secon make links say amount in words, not in numbers, or at least mixed. for example again. i've create contract with 40k zydrin, and trying to sell it as 400k of zydrine. i linking that contract to local chanel, and suprusigly find that its said 'forty thousand of zydrin' or '40 thousand of zydrin'. and if i'll try to modify it, at will post exact amout of the good i with to sell anyway.last thing is about direct trading. there is also contantly spamming in local about selling something via direct trade, because of dt's little defect, wich is used alot to get isk from ppl. its about changing amount of changing amout of offered isk in last moment. dt now prevent to removing offered items from dt window, but it doent prevent to change the price. and fix is also very simple. make the summ of isk for dt 'locked' after first typing of it. so you if yo are actualy make a misstake in typing summ of isk, you need to close current dt window, open new one, and then try again. ist raher small irritation for those who using dt not for scamming, but it will almost kill dt-scamming iitself, as it is it will finaly make spamming in jita local about such scamming worthless.finaly, i dont belive scamming will be beating in eve ever. but, it can be reduced to the point there only ppl who realy dedicated for scamming, who belived thats exactly thier playstyle, who is using thier own brain to make the scamming possible will continue to... ehm, doing what they do:)and that for good."
3/9/2010,"the point is none of that is necessary if you:a) don't use direct trades except with people you know (and trust). if the seller can't take the time to post a contract, i really don't need what you're selling.b) read everything twice - it's a wise move in real world contract dealings and it's doubly wise in eve where there are no legal penalties for (in game) fraud and scamming.if you're paying attention, and careful, you're not going to get scammed."
3/9/2010,that way haulers carrying a few battleship bpc's don't show up as having lost a few billion isk worth of stuff.
3/9/2010,"support. while you're at it, put in some kind of distinguisher between bpos and bpcs to make it easier to sort between the two..."
3/9/2010,agreed on both points. i realy hate checking all the bpc's in my hangar when things got messed up...again!
3/9/2010,yes plx
3/9/2010,supported if % damage is shown in contract; also want to be able to remotely contract any other damaged items in the same way and be given the option to repair those that can be repaired for the customary fees as part of the contracting process.in a universe where you can communicate across light years effortlessly--and where the contract process is smart enough to unload weapons remotely--it only makes sense that contracting a repair crew to do some work in a remote station should be possible.
3/9/2010,"sorry if this had been mentioned already.i get around mostly by right clicking in space and using the stargate drop down menu.what irks me is having to show info on each stargate and navigate to the system info box to see what sec status it is. that or using the mini map which uses up a lot of screen and basically you have to do the same thing.i propose that the names in the stargate drop down menu be color coded, or even go as far as to list what type of sec status it is. without having to look it up in all those windows or live in the area and get to know which system is which."
3/9/2010,"declining a mission usually means ""hey i don't wanna do this mission"" and not ""i dont wanna do this mission, please offer me the same exact mission in another system"". can we please get the mission system changed to where if you decline a mission, you aren't offered that mission immediately after declining it the first time?this is incredibly frustrating."
3/9/2010,moved to assembly hall.
3/9/2010,reasonable request actually. just set a flag on that mission you declined and reset it after the next mission is offered.
3/9/2010,"yep, sounds logical."
3/9/2010,"we cannot be silent any more. we wrote petitions - they were accepted. we filled bugreports - they were successfuly assigned. but ccp still (for at least more than a year already!) haven't fixed three fundamental flaws in game mechanics, which known to many, many pilots.here they are:1) you logoff and after that someone places aggro on you - but you will still disappear after 1 minute.2) you logoff, login, logoff, login - and appear on a spot not where you was or where you're travelling previously.3) you click warp to and instantly logoff - no one can scramble you or even lock you.what does these flaws in game mechanics allow?1. the (1) allows player, if he have enough effective hp, to escape small-to-medium camps in lowsec and during highsec war, and most of the camps in nullsec if they're without bubbles.literally, that exploit makes freighter pilot using it almost invincible even without a scout - he will die only if fled to camp of 5+ battleships that can kill him in 1 minute.also, during highsec war, if you have camping enemy pilot and he jumps to your small camp, he can just logoff on his cnr or marauder - and to disappear after 1 minute.2. the (2) exploit allows pilot to escape any camp when quitting the system - in high/low/nullsec: pilot warps to other stargate and see on your scanner that there is camp here - so you just double-logoff in warp and appear not in the camp with bubble, but on a safespot.also it allows pilot to escape in his ship (including capital) any pos blockade - even if entire pos is covered with bubbles, pilot just makes double-logoff (with 15 minute interval after first logoff) and appears on the spot, where he can turn on cloaking device, warp out, etc.also it allows safely stealing capital ships from enemy pos without a worry about pos disruptors: all you need to bump them with alt out of pos shield and get into them with your main - and logoff. pos even with 15 large autocannons will to kill ""nude"" dread or carrier in 1 minute - so after double logoff you will just appear on the safespot, not near pos.3. the (3) one makes pilot using it literally uninterceptable in high- and lowsec - regardless of the ship he is piloting (be it noobship, freighter or capital). nuff said.carebears and pvp'ers - unite! let's make ccp to fix this damned things at last, so we can happily live together in peaceful and good eve! oh, wait..."
3/9/2010,"as soon as you tell me how to tell from the server's perspective the difference between me unplugging my network cable and my internet going down, sure.i mean sure, we can trap for ctrl-q or closing the application - of course if i open task manager and just terminate the process none of that code will fire either, so..."
3/9/2010,"when you terminate your process or press ctrl-q, all tcp/udp sockets are closed and server notified about that immediately (in case of udp, by special command game sends).also, no single one of these exploits' fixes requires server to make such distinction."
3/9/2010,"1st seems to be considered as game mechanics' feature, not a bug by ccp for numerous years, so i'm inclined to neither support it nor completely disagree with you here.2nd and 3rd are obvious exploits and hopefully sooner than later will be removed from game.i'd call such distinction a bad move - it will encourage players to simulate hard disconnect."
3/9/2010,"yes, but again: no fixes for these exploits require server to ever make such distinction."
3/9/2010,)))
3/9/2010,"the 3 points in op are valid and important enough to warrant fixing. i don't see any technical difficulty of fixing them, so it's not that much to ask either. the only issue people may have is ideological one: either you believe in carebearism or hardcore pvp.i'm afraid the devs have gone soft"
3/9/2010,"yes, i want it"
3/9/2010,+1 from russian community.
3/9/2010,"for every one person rescued by the mechanic as it should be, there's a hundred people who use it for safety and personal gain. nullsec is more safe than empire with this nonsensical 'safety measure'."

3/9/2010,"""players can logon and logof as they want"". we can cry for years."

3/9/2010,it was actually in the preliminary release notes for dominion iirc. but then got pulled for the final release. pretty strange.
3/9/2010,"one year ago i've filled bugreport about it - currently it is closed with words ""fixed in: planetary interaction"". so (2) will be fixed in next expansion - tyrannis."
3/9/2010,"+1, agree with jeremey"
3/9/2010,"logging out should never be an exploit, however abusing logoff to get to an ""nth"" position that isn't where logoff 1 happened should be an exploit. also the log out when just about to come out of warp and going ~10000m/s and are invulnerable should also be fixed."
3/9/2010,agreed at all.
3/9/2010,qft
3/9/2010,agreed for 2 and 3 but 1 is intentional.
3/9/2010,"it may be intentional but it's still carebear. if the log off timer was 2 minutes, that non-aggro exploit wouldn't be so useful. in most cases when people log right before they are targeted, the attacker needs just 30-60 seconds more to finish the job.and lets face it, if you log off on purpose to save the ship, you deserve no pity. you must be destroyed."
3/9/2010,"ok has noone herd of combat probes? have an lat sit with 4 probes at 1 at aound a gate.survs 2 functions:1: insta scan for bc's and bigger on log in (if agressed for shooting/being shot by u)the players ship will sit in space for 15minits so scan them down and kill them while they log off2: pilot in capship (fitted with cloak) will be scanned when they land on there ss grid the cloak is not going to sace them when u warp to 0m with a fleet containing ceptors and dronesi dont personaly see any of the ops complaints as exploits (dont use them either)if u want the km then go the extra mile to get it, that simplestow whining and tool up for the job in hand.."
3/9/2010,"thats all fine and good until you go ld warping into (insert combat scenario here) and die because you had no chance to defend yourself against (insert anything that shoots here). a lot of legitimate disconnects happen at handoff's and spawn points like undocking, jumping, and entering a deadspace area.if you didn't get to kill that shiny freighter because he pulled the plug on you then you should have brought more firepower. it sucks and it is carebear but you could have done it where as a legitimate disconnect shouldn't suffer a ton of grief over a technical issue. as it is now i believe someone discoing is an exploit so when they do it report them and let ccp handle them. ccp developed the 1 minute timer for a reason and with a lot of thought to prevent accidental ship losses and the influx of petitions that would follow asking for reimbursement.so since you know that you have 1 minute to kill your target if he/she is a douche then plan accordingly and make the douche pay dearly. especially since if he disco's his pod will still warp off to a safespot and you can still report him for discoing and he lost his ship."
3/9/2010,"how would probes help with catching lock-immune ship in lowsec or preventing ships breaking thru gazillions of bubbles from pos in wh?don't make ld jumps, especially in systems with only 2 gates. burn your cap to warp within 1-14 au from gate, check, then warp to gate.there should be absolutely no difference between disconnect and log off in pvp (in pve it may be okay imo) - as i stated this encourages players to simulate disconnect in trouble. if you get disconnected often then your isp/switch/power upply is pile of ****, blame it and not ccp. yes, any disconnected person in pvp battle shouldn't have any additional options/abilities when compared to logged off player."
3/9/2010,"i love this suggestion, as well as all the excellent discussion for and against this proposal. would like to see more. also...supporting my own proposal!"
3/9/2010,.
3/9/2010,active tanking modules and bonuses need looked at simultaneously otherwise you'll achieve nothing because it's so much easier to fit an oversize extender/plate than it is to fit an oversize repper / booster.a large shield booster + medium cap booster takes up more pg/cpu than two large extenders and takes 109 seconds to make up the same amount of hp (assuming lvl 5 skills). not many 1 vs 1 fights are going to last long enough for that to be a worthwhile trade off.on most cruisers the choice is between a large extender or medium booster + small cap booster. until this discrepancy is fixed active tanking bonuses will be worthless on anything smaller than a battleship.quoted as proof that intelligence exists somewhere on the eve forums.
3/9/2010,strongly agree
3/9/2010,"i have to suprise you, t3 can use cov-ops cloaks, they just lack of role of covert-cyno-ships.and just how letting them using cover cyno will make bos more worthless? o_o"
3/9/2010,only 2 things need to be done.1: give it covert ops cloak.2: give it longer jump range.otherwise its foolish.give it a reason to be useful in-spite of its shortcoming dps.
3/9/2010,"i actualy like current feature of bos extra speed in cloak. as i said before they are the only ships in game now who have that feature since sbs lost it. yeah, they cant warp cloaked, but even then they are very good with t2 (or even better faction) cloak.so unless ccp will make bos run faster even in cov-ops cloak, i am againt that fix.they are not an logistic ships like carrier or jf, so why they need longer jump range?sound logical to me that bss size ship can jump only short distances, bless thier creators they are able to jump at all :)"
3/9/2010,for someone who likes black ops... you obviously don't know much about how they are employed.1: black ops ships are used as a jump bridge tool for any ship using covert ops cloaks... the whole point of black ops ships is to covert ops to strike fast and stealthy so.if a black ops ship can't warp while cloaked... its a very expensive wandering target and not likely going to be used in ambushes without decent backup or an exit...and only as a fancy covert ops bridge. it never made sense to me to call it black ops when it can't even warp while cloaked yet it enables said ships with said ability to go vast distances.2: longer jump range is for only jf and logistics? are you for real? what the hell did you think i was getting at? if you had bothered to research you'd see that the black ops has the most horid jump ranges for max range.... its dreadfully short and only allows at best short range strikes. it has nothing to do with cargo carrying.... battleships have crap for cargo space as it is... at best a fancy bpo carrier and even then that's just stupid.now if your going to argue why or why not... try to think before you post.covert ops i can get why people may not like it much... but that's just me.but everyone agrees that the jump range is limited.... why you don't doesn't make sense.and the dps doesn't make sense for its role... but the covert jump bridge makes up for it.yet this is about how unloved they are... sadly a-lot of us think they are great potentials for hit and run strikes... but a very bloody expensive one at that!lets make it worth while.
3/9/2010,"i warped alot in bo in lowsec space before, never lost it to gate camp or something. if you cant keep your bo safe (reletevly) without cov-ops cloak, it doesnt mean it cant be safe at all...dreads need longer jump range much more then bos, they dont get it. titans direly need a longer jump range, they dont get it.its dreadfully short and only allows at best short range strikes.thats what they are for, short range strikes. if you need longer distance, prepare more cover cynos on the route.tbh i like they even as they are now. more to say i will hate to see the day then bos will become overpopular. could be strange to hear, but part of the bo strange is about thier unpopularity."
3/9/2010,if only because i'm tired of hearing about it on ts.
3/9/2010,"i actually have to agree, you guys are jumping the gun, so to speak. it would be best to see what they are doing before whining about it.although im certain nothing like increasing spawns of very valuble items in one certain area of space (which happens to be host to a certain alliance) would ever happen."
3/9/2010,agreed.
3/9/2010,bob still controlling your game eh?
3/9/2010,"i am against anything that forces players to join player corps. i am just as much against players being forced into any corp at all, i am not forced into such things in the rl so a game that is supposed to be a sandbox should not be making those decisions for me.planet mining/operations should be just as mining is now, highsec means lower valued resources and limited numbers. there should be steps taken to somehow keep macro miners from setting up camp but system security levels should mandate what risk planet side structures are in.personally i see planets becoming like moons, something i will just not waste my time on. well except if 514 turns out to be a good idea....red"
3/9/2010,the only thing you are forced to do in this game is pay the monthly subscription to play. so you have nothing to worry about.
3/9/2010,"you can't launch a pos when in npc corp, i don't hear ppl whining about that. imho it's the only logical step to make planet interaction require you to do the same as when launching a pos....plz ccp remove report to another place ><"
3/9/2010,"still n.8 crystal ball, but: don't seem ""you should be in a corp"".as i was saying, the pvp part is more like market ""combat"", not pew pew.the pew pew part come in low sec/0.0 where you can deny moving the stuff you produce on planet away from the planet. you can find the interview here:"
3/9/2010,"yeah, i linked the interview at the very begining of my op so that is nothing new. the main argument is, that if you do not have to be in a player made corp, whatever market planets will provide, will be macroed just like belts are by marco miners (in this case planets)sure 0.0 and even low sec will be harder to do, but every high sec planet will be f.u.b.a.r.edit: spelling"
3/9/2010,"you have no idea of how the mechanic will work but you are ""sure"" that it will be something that can be macro mined. if you had read the little stuff that has been said (introducing tyrannis), it don't seem the case, it will be more similar to moon mining than asteroid mining: start the activity and return after a time to collect the results. we are both using a number 8 crystal ball upon very few informations, but you add in your previsions the caveat that the developer will be totally stupid, i hope they are reasonably intelligent. hi sec return will be low, but simply because the planets are relatively few and there will be a lot of competition, so each planet will have a lot of players using a few resources. as for all other activities that could be done with little effort, little capital and low skills the net profit will decrease very fast to a minimum wage level. it is the same for building, trading and mining. even high level missions are somewhat nerfed by that (even if they require more skills and equipment and the bounties are fixed) as the value of lp and loot has decreased to minimal levels. rtm people will maybe do them (no need for a macro if they will work as depicted in the blog)? possible. it is a good reason to deny them to part of the players? no, especially as the suggested cure will cure nothing. forcing players and macro in shell corps with one wooden head sitting as ceo and one character will change nothing. you wardec them and they move from one corp to another in 24 hours. net result you have simply annoyed the real players forcing them to form shell corps but you have resolved nothing. apparently some people think that forcing other players in shell corps will cure anything in the game. wishful thinking but it will do absolutely nothing beside annoying people and making corporate management 1 a essential skill."
3/9/2010,more important is a function to filter bpcs/bpos. but htis has my support.
3/9/2010,"with regards to the csm minutes posted in the recent dev blog there was a mention of the possibility of maknig it that being warp scrambled will stop a ship from being able to dock. instead, i would suggest creating a module specifically for this, which can only prevent docking and has no other purpose. this could only be fit to an interdictor (high slot module).the purpose of this modification to the original suggestion is:1. to give the interdictors a unique role in high sec and low sec pvp. currently, they are quite rarely used in high sec/low sec.2. as per the conversation in the csm minutes, it would be a way to counter ""docking games"" or carriers sitting on stations ganking ships with relative safety. though i personally feel it's not something which should be an effect of warp disrupting/scrambling a ship, there should be a specific choice/decision made to use the tactic.tl:drmake a high slot module for interdictors which stops ships from docking."
3/9/2010,"came in expecting to be against it, but as long as its done as you suggested-a specific module, and limited to interdictors i'd support it."
3/9/2010,agreed sounds like a good idea if its done where its a specialized mod only for ceptors.
3/9/2010,at the very least you need first windows in stations. but even then it only will increase the amount of station camping going on.
3/9/2010,"if this module prevents people from docking in highsec then i am against it. however if station campers need help in low sec i really wouldn't care either way.of course, the chances of this being an actual vote are pretty limited.red"
3/9/2010,"i support this if stations also have windows so that you can see if someone's outside waiting for you. highsec wars tend to be mostly undock games, which are lame."
3/9/2010,supported as in being only usable on a specific class ship (what about interceptors? :s ) under the condition that we can see what's outside the station while being docked.
3/9/2010,"or better yet, assault frigates to give them a role in fleets.i don't know really. i am really against the whole, ""hey, i can see out the windows so i can fit specific.""i just see this as a docking game boost right now."
3/9/2010,imo docking prevention needs to be possible. a specific mod for it sounds great to me but i am unsure if it needs to be restricted to a specific ship.as far as windows i think they are not 100% necessary. but i am not against them as long as them being required does not delay the implementation of docking prevention mechanics.the mechanic for windows could possibly be implemented like the directional scanner could possibly work. with a much longer delay (30 seconds?) and possibly not directional with limited range.
3/9/2010,as long as it only works on capital ships.
3/9/2010,"this - station undock gankers do not need a boost, thank you very much."
3/9/2010,"the csm felt that any such module being introduced into the game would have to go hand in hand with being able to see and overview of what is outside the station while still docked, though i personally liked the suggestion of making it more like the ship scanner, and only able to be used once every 30 seconds."
3/9/2010,well tubes ^^ one thing i notice u did not add in the opso as that is was not an iwin button for every ship.i was restricted to a class of ship so that you would not have droves of ships fitted with it and perma holding some guy in placesecondly: that it was a module (not unlike ecm) that when used would jam your ability to comunicate by jamming your sensore(comms arrey)it would have a 30 second activation so that if it missed a cycle the player would have a chance of escape(he would need to be on the ball though)
3/9/2010,"you're a moron.and for your second point, to me that's a stupid idea, therefore i did not include it."
3/9/2010,sry not supporting this. unless you have a way to see out you will get r#ped because currently you have no way to know a station is being camped then to undock. although i do hate docking games.....
3/9/2010,tractor beams that affect ships. pull with a force and speed based on mass differential.pull those bastards right off the undock.oh so fun.
3/9/2010,"as it currently stands i will have to vote down on this one for now.since the talks are heading towards a module to be used on one of the smaller ships, i do not see a tackler pulling anything larger then another tackler, no matter what the module was.slade"
3/9/2010,this was my initial concern. but i'm sure it won't take long for the hordes to start recommending an alt to take a peak or trouble a friend a few systems away to come see for you.welcome to alts online.
3/9/2010,"indeed, although and alt won't help you when a lowsec or 0.0 station is being camped...."
3/9/2010,"supported. interdictors are very fragile ships. it's not like they can just bubble and run away with this module. make the range of this docking disruption module to be relatively short, like 10km. this way, there will be considerable risk while operating anti-station games interdictor.but, yes, i do agree that you should be able to see outside of the station if this is actually implemented."
3/9/2010,agreed to both points.without a means of seeing outside the station its an i-win button for station campers. with a means of seeing outside its an interesting idea for a highly specialized fleet role.
3/9/2010,"as it is having negative sec status is more like a badge of honor or prize for a pirate. it's just as useful as the bounty they carry. there is absolutely nothing about a negative sec that cannot be overcome with an alt.no doubt this will cause lots of tears among what i call ""carebear pirates"" (players that behave more like carebears than pirates). and in spite of this whinage id like for us to maturely critique and discuss the following changes to make having negative standings more challenging and actually mean something more than just a badge to proudly display.1. fix sec status so that anything resembling a pirate in lo sec can be attacked without penalty to one's self. lo sec pirates usually keep their sec status above -5 which translates to a sec penalty if someone attacks them. this goes hand in hand with making it more of a grind to rat your sec status up (see point #5).2. make kill rights discreetly transferable so pirates don't know who has dibbs on them.3. add higher sec penalties when blobs are involved in lo sec. if a 10-man gang attacks a solo ratter they take a greater hit in sec status. the more pirates are involved in a kill the greater the sec status loss. this should discourage blobs/ganks a bit.4. make aggro timers dynamic and dependent on a player's sec status. the lower the sec status the longer the aggro timer. yes, i know it's annoying but that's the point; make negative status carry real consequences that cannot be circumvented with alts. the current ""mickey mouse"" consequences are a joke. and an honest pirate will admit to it. so a -10 with aggro would have to wait maybe 15 to 20 minutes to be able to dock and clear his aggro.5. make it so gaining positive sec status immediately after aggressing someone is harder. for example, if a carebear pirate wants to rat his sec status back up it will be more difficult to do if he had attacked someone in say, less than a month ago. if the carebear pirate has not attacked anyone in a month then he may rat his sec status back up at the normal speed. this month can be thought of as reflection and penitence time that shows a genuine desire to be good :p.anyway, let the pirate tears blot out the sun!!!in all seriousness, i am expecting a whole lot of immature responses and the normal idiotic behavior id expect from carebear pirates. however, i will see past that and hope i can have a serious discussion with the more mature playerbase.discuss and critique!"
3/9/2010,"you really have not earned a constructive response based on your usual behavior.however, i'm feeling kind this morning:1. i got no problem with making life a tad rougher on ""**** yellow"" pirates. no tears from me here.2. sure. whatever. won't matter to anyone i've ever flown with. i never pay attention to whether anyone has kill rights on me in system. as a -10 player i am a free target to everyone. no tears from me here.3. if being -10 is a badge of honor then i don't understand how you are hoping to illicit tears by making it easier to get to -10. no tears from me here.4. if you make a proposal that actually diminishes the amount of pvp possible in the game, don't expect it to be supported by many players or devs. this one is so bad that it isn't going to go further than your imagination. no tears from me here.5. again, if -10 is a badge of honor than you have just made it easier to both get there and stay there. i got no problems with it. it won't happen anyway. the devs have this funny philosophy where they like for players to have few restrictions and lots of freedom. strange, no? no tears from me here.this is why you'll always be my cupcake. you are just so darned cute!"
3/9/2010,"it's not just about making it easier to get to -10. it's about adding consequences on your way there as well. as you said yourself these changes will mostly affect those playing ""sec status"" yo-yo games, namely carebear pirates.in reference to your response to #4, it's about adding real consequences. as it stands there are no real consequences to having negative status. it seems to me that out of everything i suggested this would be the only one to affect you. and since that seems to be the case, why would you stop pvping all together for this minor inconvenience? what's wrong with ""earning"" that -10 with a little take? what's wrong with having actual consequences to your actions?and if it's as you say, the whole point to pirating is to do it without any real consequences so that there is lots of pvp in the game, then why not just get rid of the whole joke that sec status and bounties are? that would surely encourage more pirating and more pvp in general, would you not agree?thanks ."
3/9/2010,"yellow pirates should be concorded the minute they enter highsec. i am almost always ""pirated"" when i enter low/null sec, so they should feel the pain and be better balanced. if you choose a life of crime then you need to forfit your civilized system rights.red(flame suit on)"
3/9/2010,do it.now.i'm tired of using ctrl+alt+shift+downarrow+r for binds.
3/9/2010,"mining should be boring, i prefer it that way. it should also remain as a reaaaallllyyy slow way to gain isk. boring and the least profit making venture, forces people to move on to other things, its a natural progression and should not be messed with. i like mining but also think that mining technology (strip miners, mining upgrades) should not be advanced any further.monday-thursday i mine a few hours at night while i catch up on all my favorite shows. friday, i update all my variouis trade orders and saturday i run missions or do some things with friends. if mining is messed with too much, i have to spend more time trying to make enough isk to play thru the weekends."
3/9/2010,"to give further purpose to certain modules (faction turrets) and to encourage players to fit faction ships with their racial modules, make it so fitting a faction module on a ship from the same faction gives a slight boost to attributes. this could come in the form of damage bonus (turrets), range (webs) or a general over heating bonus for the modules. the bonus would be quite small, perhaps 2% so it doesn't tread too much on the toes of deadspace modules."
3/9/2010,"you mean a 'set bonus', the problem is that if you 2% per gun, or 2% more mwd for ships that alrady have a record of being solopwnzwagons then you end up with a ship that becomes a threat to sizes of ships that it shouldn't be fighting, last thing i want to see is a dramiel that has enough dps to take down a battecruiser."
3/9/2010,"its an interesting idea, would do something to make otherwise identical mods distinct from each other, and there's a certain logical appeal in having faction equipment optimised to function with their corresponding faction vessel.as above though, it would need to be implemented carefully in case a particular combination proved unbalancingly powerful. tentative support."
3/9/2010,"i was encouraged to post this on behalf on a lazy alliance mate. i do agree it would need to be carefully implemented, perhaps it would be less likely to result in over powered ships if it gave purely overheat damage reduction of a small amount. just something to not make it overpowered but which does result in some benefit.and just in case it wasn't clear from the op, this would only apply to faction/pirate ships, not regular t1 or t2 hulls."
3/9/2010,it always seems logical to me to fit a navy raven with navy mods. however i do agree it would be very tricky to balance...nonetheless i like it.
3/9/2010,"assuming that any balance issues can be worked out so that, as mentioned before, these ships don't become omgwtfsolobbqpwnmobiles (of doom) then i'm all for it.i mean if i'm willing to field a faction ship with faction mods, i should get some benefit from it aside from being called primary first."
3/9/2010,"how hard would it be to have more missions....not more missions as it stands now, ie. go here kill stuff return to base, or the occasional ""mine this and bring it back"", or the ""go bring this to be from another station.""but rather, more... engaging missions, maybe missions with a conversation between you and an npc (instead of go here and click name, accept mission). maybe even a new mission type, diplomacy missions if you will. also, maybe some scanning/probing missions (maybe even some hacking/archaeological missions)"
3/9/2010,"no.hulk pilots should just accept that flying a t2 ship means you lose a lot of cash when you fail to tank it and it dies. if they want to be safe, they should fly t1 covetors which are insurable. thats what the gankers are doing.its ganking people with marauders and whining because you never make any money at it."
3/9/2010,"it was an example. the loss is next to nothing is the point, suicide ganking should be a group of ppl kill a freightor because the guy had alot of stuff that was worth money. i think this idea is better than throwing away insurance, or making suicide ganking = no insurance at all.."
3/9/2010,"no offense, but having never been ganked, your speaking out of your ass. i've been ganked many times, twice in a proteus, few times while hauling (lost 500mil on one haul) and that sucks, but it's eve. if people wanna be little *****s and can't take null sec then just use your killrights and take you money back."
3/9/2010,"insurance is broken, which is why suicide ganking is currently unbalanced. rather than apply a band-aid to just one symptom, fix the root cause. make the insurance value dynamic, based on the traded mineral cost of the ship, so that it is never possible to make a profit from buying a ship to destroy it, and the problem is largely solved, along with several other problems."
3/9/2010,"this - as much as malcanis and i rarely see eye to eye on anything, he's got the right of this one. insurance needs to stop being based on fixed based prices and start being based on the actual value of the asset (which is how real insurance policies work)."
3/9/2010,^^^ this.
3/9/2010,r u proposing to make t2 and t3 all reward no risk so t1 becomes utterly useless? 'cause there's already a game like that--it's called world of warcraft.
3/9/2010,"i've got two problems with suicide ganking on the whole.1. as people have said, the current ""minimum loot to be a worthwhile gank"" is way too low. you could have half an industrial full of quafe and it'd be profitable to gank. if someone is hauling lots of expensive stuff, they should have to be on the lookout, but i'm of the opinion that moving, say, an iteron ii of tritanium should be fairly safe on autopilot. this also applies to ganking for tears, where people begin to gank expensive ships not for profit, but merely because they'll destroy more than they lose (because you lose so little). if you want to say ""we'll lose 100 mil of ship to destroy 200 mil of ship"", sure, at least you're putting something out there. 10 mil for 500 mil? not such a good exchange.2. escorting in hisec is tricky. you're basically relegated to rrs and even then ganksquads are rather quick and you'd need good timing or a lot of repairs. because the ganking side will always always always have the first shot, there's no way to be proactive about escorting. in short, if i've got a 200 million isk budget to protect my industrial full of tritanium, and the gankers have a 100 million isk budget to gank it, they'll win every time, because there's no real way to spend that money to proactively defend against ganking. this harkens back to the spent/destroyed comparison uptop because the gankers only really need to factor in their single target ship. the industrial can spend 500 million isk on escorts but all that really mattes is how much tank they can pack into the target ship (which is fairly limited without a lot of rr) whereas the ganksquad's applied dps is far more easily raised (hire another raven). it also has the same issue as eccm, namely you have to fit and prepare for someone that probably won't occur, so you're better off just losing a ship every once in a while and not sacrificing your day-to-day effectiveness. hiring a merc corp to escort you everywhere with rrs, for instance, means you'll never make a profit.the combination of #1 and #2 is bad, because it basically puts hisec industry at the mercy of suicide gankers, with no real way to combat it. ideally, if the gankee is willing to expend more resources than the gankers, he should have some sort of defensive option."
3/9/2010,"all kinds of greatness in this thread.bs turrets are too small. in fact they should be about 3x the size they are now at a minimum.all gun effects suck except lasers...go figure. ac's should either fire a burst of ammo or continuously fire through the cycle time and both projectile systems should have much better firing and hitting effects. hybrids also have crappy effects. most guns sound like complete crap(though i like med rails). a large ac should sound more like a 25mm bushmaster chaingun instead of a spitwad cannon and a small ac should sound like a burst from a minigun with the cycle noise in between bursts, even if the computer is simulating the sound give me the choice of the sound. hell in theory you could program the computer to make it sound like you were shooting geese or cows at your enemy so why not sound...eh...real? then intensify the effect if you are overheating the system.missile effects are ridiculous in that i would love to see smoke trails and explosions that were much smaller and spherical instead of planar.the hull damage idea is cool though aging as you own your ship is kind of dumb but if it is limited to your client and you can turn it off then i am all for it. at least let me bust out a high pressure washer and a paint brush to keep her looking good and don't kill bandwidth with something unnecessary.it would be cool to see smoke coming from your engine if you are using an ab or mwd intensify this for overheating as well.i don't like the change to wrecks since it really adds nothing to the game unless you are directly looking at the wreck but meh.sounds good."
3/9/2010,"this was mentioned in the c&p section, and i quite liked the idea:something in game needs to be added to allow for the smuggling of drugs. the idea of risking a payload of drugs to sell in highsec seems like it could be quite interesting if done right, not to mention boosters could take a slight tweak anyways."

3/9/2010,more words tia
3/9/2010,"this, many of those actuallyedit/ supporting my own idea !"
3/9/2010,only when we start banning stupid proposals.
3/9/2010,i want to know the net isk flow from eve insurance.there's the negative flow from purchases of insurance plans and positive flow from payouts. what is the net change over 1 month? does it fluctuate greatly from month to month or is is a stable figure?i think this data would help people discussing insurance system more objectively. and there's no reason to keep the info hidden.
3/9/2010,you mean the same guy that didnt know that the increase in pyerite prices came from insurance fraud?
3/9/2010,"1. your topic is in the wrong place, the assembly hall is for proposals and issues, of which this is neither.2. net income/expenses depend on the mineral prices of the month. higher mineral prices = more cost to build = less or negative insurance payout from self-destruction. lower costs = lower cost to build = more profit from insuring and self-destructing.3. minerals will never go below a certain price (market floor) because when they get cheap, people buy them, and there there is less of them, and when people stop buying they get cheap because there is more of them (supply and demand)."
3/9/2010,yeah the same guy.
3/9/2010,isnt the assembly hall is for what you want to bring to the attention of the csm? i think this is an excellent place to ask this question. anyway what i would like to see the eveonline economist do is calculate insurance policies for ships every few months. i guess this is a proposal.
3/9/2010,"i'm sure it been asked for before. why must my freighter pilot have to contract all his rigged ships to an alt, to have the alt set up a courier contract for the freighter pilot to deliver?and once the ships are delivered, the alt has to contract them back to the freighter pilot!please make it so that the freighter pilot can make the courier contract and accept it himself. in fact seeing as this is also nonsensical, just allow rigged ships to be placed in a freighter without all the contract malarky."
3/9/2010,"as the way i see it, in eve, if your escorting a ship you can't really throw yourself in front of oncoming fire. therefore i believe that there should be a module/warfare link that makes you unable to target a certain ship. i think it should be a warfare link within the fleet that forces the targeting system of the hostile ship to randomly select another ship in the fleet (that is in system and in range). while i do see some exploits/faults with this idea, i was hoping that the community could help work them out. otherwise, the community would come to realize that this idea could not ever work, please provide criticism."

3/9/2010,"hi,some of the ingame effects got an overhaul recently and are stunning now. for instance laser or projectile effects. or the armor rep effect. or the web effect. btw: make sure you've hdr and bloom enabled - it is a huge difference sometimes!other effects didn't get an update yet:(1) missiles - graphics:see my sig, that's what i mean ^^ missiles should be launched at separated points on the ship. it's a pity they're blobbed in one uncool glowing ball atm. it would look way cooler if they would fly on parallel routes onto the target. and no, it wouldn't lead to more server lag because it's a pure client side effect, which can be turned of. the server doesn't even need to know about detached missile routes. for the server it's still one volley of a number grouped missile launchers. if the missiles are detached, they should look small but more gleaming. for ingame comparison just look the new salvager effect. the shiny point in the wreck. or just remember the look of star trek photon torpedos.(2) missiles - sound:they sound to low-tech (""hissing"") to loud and not powerful enough imo. and it's the same sound for all sizes. turrets do different sounds for different turret sizes. i propose a more ""high-tech"" and more subtle - but powerfull at the same time - launch sound. good comparison are the missile effects in the new bsg series (cylons) or the star trek series and movies.(3) rails - graphics:i did a serpentis mission, first time after enabling bloom and hdr. the incoming railgun effect of the npcs was really awesome. difficult to descibe. maybe call it a ultra fast moving ""shred"" of high energy towards you. important is that's not a continuous ray - that's what makes them different from lasers and looks cool. as said - the npc railgun effect is nice. only the player railgun effect looks unspectacular! why?!(4) rails - sound:small and medium rails are nice imo. it's the short and hefty ""bang"" sound which makes them cool. just large rails should sound much more hefty. they sound weak atm. (5) blasters - sound:same like rails. the large ones sound too weak. blaster in general should sound very ""dry"" and short and hefty. atm it's a bit too much ""hissing"" imo.(6) sentry and combat drones - graphics:they are barely visible on the field right now. only exception are projectile drones (sentry and combat) maybe. i'd like to see a much more visible effect - like logistics drones. for instance gallente and caldari drones could do a blaster-like (combat drones) or railgun-like (sentries) effect. ofc not that dominant like turrets but still very good visible. it's a pity a sentry dominix just get lost when an amarr bs starts it's light show ^^(7) combat drones - sound:the bigger ones should do a more brutal sound than the smaller ones. atm they do the same.(8) lasers - sound:lasers are too dominant atm. you need to have just one laser ship in your fleet and you don't hear anything other ^^ imho they should tuned down a bit. that would appear more high-tec and space-like then also.(9) sensor boosters/eccm - graphics:too bright and really disturbing over the time. (10) sensor boosters - sound:too loud and disturbing. needs to tuned down a fair bit!(11) shield hardeners - graphics:i'd propose any fancy effect here instead of just a second semi-transparent layer around the ship (and each spike). the armor hardener effect is really nice in comparison.(12) shield hardeners - sound:they are too dominant.(13) shield, amor and hull notifications:why these ""beep"" sounds? more aura!!1 plz let aura announce ""low shields"" or ""low armor"" - she does that for capacitor already!--one note to my ""too loud"" remarks: if one effect is too loud, lowering the master game volume doesn't help much ^^ other sounds (""your capacitor is empty"") wouldn't be hearable that way. that's all"
3/9/2010,"not supported, ever think that perhaps high-sec pos's are harder to kill by design? to even put one up you need a corp standing of 10x the sec status of the system with the owning faction, plus it consumes faction charters which you or who-ever you buy them from needs to run missions to get the lp to purchase them with. in whiskey space you have the option of building a dread in the system to take it down, as last i checked the xtra-large ship array could build them and didn't need sov to anchor/on-line."

3/9/2010,stupid that i have to make another post to support my own idea.
3/9/2010,"this is stupid. it really is, think through it first. insurance puts a floor on the prices miners receive for their work, and even mission runners to some extent. it encourages pvp by making ships cheaper, and by covering more of a loss (hello, insurance) people are more willing to undock.think of a real world scenario. i have car insurance that covers all damage after $500. i pay my money every six months (lasts three months in eve) and i'm set. i get a new car if my car gets owned. i'm not scared to drive because my car might get wrecked, because i know it won't be the end of the world. people do take losses on insurance, when they fly multiple ships with rigs (as there is no reason to not rig now) some insurance will inevitably lapse. people can't easily make money through insurance. but you also shouldn't fault people for using a mechanic in the game for making money, if anything you should go after macrominers that oversupply the minerals that make producing ships that cheaply possible.my second major point is the absolute last thing this game needs is fewer people undocking because they are scared of losing their ships. if you think it is bad now just imagine how it would be if you cut insurance payouts by 1/3 or more. it is really, really dumb."
3/9/2010,"i'm surprised there is so little comment on ccp's response to suicide ganking and insurance. essentially it's ""suicide ganking is ok, except we will put protections in case newbies accidentally concordokken themselves."" whether or not your position on it, i would have expected more back and forth posted in the minutes on that and a more detailed response from ccp.also this little gem:so don't expect faction warfare to be upgraded anytime soon, but we'll fix any exploits we see pop up if it wont kill the server.the csm raise needed points, but ccp's response to me is pretty disappointing."
3/9/2010,"macro miners don't bother me, even when i see 70+ ships sitting in a ice feild. isk farmers actually don't bother me either and it would seem that eve actually does a pretty good job of finding and banning those players. however i do understand that wide spread farming can have adverse effects on a game so see the need for ccp to be active. if there is proof that a macro miner is an isk farmer then ban the account.i tried ice mining for a while but quickly decided its not worth the effort. one field i was bothered quite often by the other ""real"" people who were very territorial of their ice field but the other one which was obviously a macro field didn't bother me once and i was able to try the ice mining out. given the choice between chatty cathy's and mining bots, i preger the bots cause they leave everyone else alone."
3/9/2010,"the planets - phisically 'correct' planets. would be good to take a look at. granted as far as i understand ccp has already acknowledged that there is issue. but seeing as planetary interaction is coming as next expansion it might be worth poking at it some to make sure it is something that does not get forgotten, as it's a lot harder to fix afterwards."
3/9/2010,"this thread is bad and you should feel terrible.you are also mis-using the definition of 'playing' in the eve universe. change it to 'paying' would be more accurate.if you are paying, you have the option of playing, where as someone who is (was) ghost training would not. you may say 'but i actually meant playing' - but, then, do you really expect people to play 23/7/365?finally, as people have said, the offline training at a constant speed is one of the unique feature and draws of eve. if you don't like it, then gtfo, and find another mmo that has a experience system that you like. there are plenty out there."

3/10/2010,"that's the most interesting part of your post, for me. are you implying that most fleet battles in 0.0 happen because both fcs honestly believe they're going to win? and that the objective is to one-volley the opposing ships? if the enemy is able to disengage at will then i can't see any other conclusion.in some respects your point is self-contradictory; fighting from 230km clearly holds a massive advantage, if it changes the enemy's perspective from ""let's fight, i think we'll win this one"" to ""we have no chance of winning"". i realise that given your earlier point this would not get you any kills, but it clearly has tipped the scales massively in your favour and thus is a powerful advantage?that's an interesting point, and a good one. the advantage of extra range is of course that you can outdamage the enemy snipers at that range; but if most of your fleet is still at the standard range then they can still be fired on.so you can make pseudo-invincible rokhs, but if these form a small percentage of your fleet, it's not likely to swing things one way or another. or in other words, it merely changes the order of the enemy's primaries, pushing your rokhs to the end (where you argue they might be anyway due to the resist bonus), so it's only going to materially have an impact once all the non-rokhs are dead.mmm-hmm, that does seem a bit silly. especially when a sniper ship could get a second bonus to help with this - damage and tracking being the obvious ones, though both of these are typically gallente bonuses so presumably that's why they haven't been applied.i don't know if negated is quite the word. it arguably makes your ship individually better, the issue is that most of your gangmates don't have the same advantage and so die first. and then it's a n-vs-5n[/i] fight if you lost, or a win if you win. but this is surely always true of inspecting individual performance of a ship in a fleet composed of disparate ship types?only compared to lasers (unsurprisingly). arties have half the clip size and have to reload too.only compared to the capless projectiles; lasers take mroe than twice as much cap. (and yes, almost all amarr laserboats get a cap reduction bonus, but that basically turns them into single-bonused ships just so they can use lasers.)again, lasers fare arguably worse here, with fixed damage types that are additionally worse against armour (likely to be the dominant tank in bs fleets, as i understand).true. (though for a given dps, low alpha <=> high rof, and depending on the situation it's not clear which is preferable.)all high-calibre long-range guns are hard to fit. whether rails are harder[/i] to fit to their respective ships is hard to say, but 425s seem easier to fit than 1400 arties or tachs. rails have notably lower base grid requirements at the very least.could you expand on that? at a glance they don't seem to be tiered any worse/better than beams or arties (looking at damage/range/fallof vs cap/fitting/tracking)..."
3/10/2010,"it's a reasonable point, and i believe in that situation i might find it within me to trust my sargeant. however, if the sargeant then wants to propose refinements/improvements to the cleaning process, based on his beliefs and without any hypothetical testing, then he does need to be able to justify his proposals, even to those who have not had to clean guns in a warzone before. especially as the chances are that half the board that will review his request will not have the same experience he does, and because his proposals will ripple beyond the sargeant's operational theatre.in order to investigate the problems with the weapons system, i was establishing the baseline situation. replace ""mega"" with ""<typically shortest-ranged fleet sniper>""; the weapons system is irrelevant at that point, as its purpose is merely to establish the maximum range that commonly all fleet snipers can engage at, and which the fc will use if he's going to warp everyone as one blob.eft 2.12 at least does include hit quality in damage figures, and so shows a gun doing 40 dps at optimal and 15 dps at optimal + falloff.i don't know about ""well within""; theoretically it's 231+48 for the tachs vs 274+58 for 425s, so the tachs are at 91.5% falloff (at which point they do 43.7% base damage).in practice this is irrelevant because of the locking range cap, but i definitely support removing/increasing this to allow a rokh's longer optimal with spike to at least exist. additionally, tachs are slightly problematic with respect to balance and i would tentatively support a review of them. (comparing against megabeams, rokh's optimal is at 168% falloff.)not ignoring - acknowledging and investigating how this ""fix"" would put things. as said above, i agree that the lock limit needs to be lifted. clearly this is a technological decision (probably one made 6 years ago when ""250k is enough for anyone"" ).indeed. but if they're balanced on raw stats and broken on ships, the ships must be fixed, not the guns."
3/10/2010,"1) the proposal is based on data (ship utilization, fleet engagement envelope, ship attributes) corroborated by numerous independent parties. it is not based on ""beliefs"" but on experience (experience can be quantified) that define the design framework.2) hypothesis testing? we are dealing with a deterministic system (it is a simulation after all and we have the functions- eft, falloff calculations). hypothetical testing in this case is running the numbers in eft and making the graphs. if you want to discuss benchmarking and how we should do it for these ships, sure, i'll be happy to explain.3) you seem to have not read the thread, where the different scenarios and ripples to other railgun applications (pve) are examined extensively. we even discussed how this change will affect the performance of kronos and came to the conclusion that it will enhance it without making it more powerful than the rest of the marauders. it will actually not move it at all in the pecking order, but it will be a more satisfying ship to fly.4) you seem hell-bent to force the discussion on changing ships instead of the weapon system-ammo interaction (as i have said before, a 15% damage increase to the ammo is very interesting and it might be exactly what blaster users are asking). let's enumerate the ships that need a buff because of hybrids: rokh, mega, hype, ferox, eagle, deimos, harpy, moa, merlin. would you suggest that all these get a damage bonus to compensate for the railguns' anemic performance? oh, wait, some of them already have one and it does not fix the problem. therefore, we need to look for the simplest solution (ocam's razor). the common trait is the weapon system, therefore the weapon system needs to be fixed.5) you seem confused. you talk about hypothetical situations that do not happen or require a system change more radical than increasing the damage attributes of railguns. just to let you know, if the lock limit increases to 300km the probability for lag situations increases by 80%. i don't think ccp will lift the lock limit any soon.6) baseline situation was established. you failed to substantiate any faults in that baseline. you try to hypothesize a different situation that we informed you many times does not happen. you want to pass that non-existent situation falsely as baseline. well, to do so you need to prove to us that your hypothetical situations are more probable than what we use as baseline from field data. in effect, if you can get the fcs of it, rzr, -a-, atlas, mm, tcf etc to come here and state that they order engagement for their fleet at 230km+, then you will have justified your views. otherwise, you are just trying to create a strawman argument.to recapitulate:1) fleetbs engagement envelope is 170-190km. fleet operates as a unit(megas/pests will warp-in @ 170, apocs/rokhs @ 190).2) sniperhac engagement envelope is 70-100km. range is dictated by game mechanics, and ship speed/ agility (get in position burning w/ mwd).3) ranged anti-support engagement envelope is out to 80km, mission is to obliterate asap any enemy support that enters that area to protect the fleet bs.is that clear now? btw, care to enlighten us what is your experience with hybrids?"
3/10/2010,"let's form a fleet together. if you can warp to warp to me at 150km with the click of a button, then you win the argument and rokhs can warp in at 230km and engage.the problem with your argument is that the way fleet fights work is a cloaky or ceptor sets up between 50-100km from the enemy fleet, then the fleet warps to them at 100km. alternately, for a fleet that is already in place, they setup several sniping locations at about 150-180km from the gate the enemy will come in through. in this case, you have no ability to engage at any other range that the sniping spot range as you are warping around the gate, so warping at anything other than 0km will put you closer to the enemies, not further.in effect, even if you wanted to engage at a longer range than the rest of the fleet, the only way to do that is to warp in at the same point as everyone else, then use up your cap burning out to the range you want to engage at... in the meantime, the fleet is probably about to warp to another spot (this happens every few minutes so the other fleet cannot get a close range warp-in on your fleet). so, if range is a benefit, the warp-to ranges would need to be at least 200km and that would only work half the time. allowing warp ins less than 200km would only allow the warp in point to be closer to the enemy fleet.a sniper engagement is like a ballet where both sides keep moving to prevent their ships from being tackled by a dictor/hictor. generally, both fleets align to a warp out spot so ships can immediately warp out if they are locked. unless a pilot is an idiot and doesn't warp right away, the only way to kill them is to 1-volley them. the only time when warp outs are not used is when a system is swarming with both fleets, so warp outs are not safe. lag is usually horrible in those cases, so rr usually can get to work before a second salvo is fired, so you are left with needing to 1-salvo them once more.when a fleet finds that they cannot 1-salvo the other fleet repeatedly, and/or start losing their own ships, and/or see that their sniper spots are compromised, they will disengage.this is how sniper fights work in eve. so, no, having a fleet capable of engaging at a longer range will only be a benefit until the other fleet adapts. at which point your fleet will have to adapt. eventually, both will disengage because neither will be able to engage for more than a few seconds at their desired range and they will quickly run out of safe warp in/out spots.bringing a sniper hac to a sniper bs fight is suicide. plus, both ship types have almost the same cost but the hac doesn't have insurance."

3/10/2010,"1. shield and armor tanking is two different concepts.2. regeneration is an integral part of shield tanking.3. you give up other things in order to gain regeneration.4. a dumbed down example is to square shield regeneration against lower nominal hp total with worse fitting restrictions/options.5. thus any percentage based armor bonus is likely to introduce a higher total hp bonus (crude: 1600mm mindlink hp bonus > lse mindlink hp bonus).6. not letting shield bonuses apply instantly and citing regeneration is thus dually punitive (regneration and total hp).= let the bonuses apply instantly, let the shields gain the indirect bonus to regeneration.no need for complex balancing acts.the effective application of the regeneration bonus is far less representative ingame than the 'loss' of total hp is limiting.else, provide me one live example where added effect of regeneration would risk throwing the game balance worse than what is currently incurred.+ support for the idea, even if the regeneration penalty isn't needed in my book."

3/10/2010,"well, like i pointed in another unrelated thread (about rr mechanics) old & ugly foundation code (read: touch it and the game easily breaks) is managing both pve and pvp and this is a major scare factor for ccp to make changes, expecially when the cases are so specific.in particular, in some places the code seems not discerning between npc vs pc being the originator of the actions.example of very often dc / crash scenario: player warps in plex or mission, npcs could almost insta-scram (usually it's npc frigs vs player battleship size signature).with no intervening mechanic, the ship is basically as good as dead.to counter this ccp made frigs randomly turn off scram or switch to web and often there's some kms of space before the frigs can lock, all to prevent lots of ragequits and petitions.there are still some missions which are an harsher exception to this, though and it's why i believe they still let exist that behavior you noticed.now, if the combat code could detect that it's a pc point being made and not an npc, it could probably act differently. something tells me it's not so though and to change it, it requires to open their can'o'worms code.maybe it's intended. they are bringing their biggest available ""horsepower"", not an iteron.you are bringing in an agile setup (to be able to gtfo i suppose, are you sure you are not being 'bear at all in this?) that is not your biggest available horsepower, yet you want to kill their biggest horsepower?i mean, would using battleships be enough? yes, they are. but you use bcs and / or hacs and / or inties etc because you don't want to be hotdropped so you are also not perfectly virgin in this talk.said that, i'd be totally fine to have pc scrammed ships die, i just don't think ccp are ready to fiddle with what ""works since years"".i'll even add more meat about the exploits: ok it's fine that t3 needed some ""push"" because after so much work they revealed to be meh and players ignored them.but isn't it vastly too much (to ""sell"" t3 to the players) to give them te ability to be unscannable? what counter for that? logoffski can be countered with effort, exactly like mwd + cloak can be < 100% safe.but what's counterable about total immunity from probes? *goes to create a thread for it*"

3/10/2010,"i have an idea for cloaking, which at least seems interesting in concept if not in actual mechanics...when using covops cloaks (ie, the only ones where you can do anything at all with the cloak on) if you warp, you hafta pay a small fuel cost (around 20 units per au jumped) after which you decloak. this might balance recon cloakers slightly, but afk cloaking is fine. if you're so paranoid of someone who can't move, shoot, or chances are even find you, you shouldn't be complaining. after all, you can still see them in local.edit: so what if they're scan immune? that's the whole point of a cloak. that's like saying you should be able to shoot people while cloaked."
3/10/2010,"he is talking about a common setup for t3 shipsdissolution sequencer electronic subsystem (gives sensor strength per level)interdiction nullifier propulsion subsystem (bubble immune)optionally:covert op offensive subsystemwarfare processor defensive subsystem (gang link bonuses)the dissolution sequencer subsystem can raise your sensor strength to a lvl, where it is very hard to probe you out when you fit 1-2 eccm. (jfyi, formular is: sigradius/sensorstrength <= 1.08)so for roaming gangs you get a nice commandship that is relatively safe.some people also use this relative safety from being probed to run missions/plexes in less friendly space, but their tanks are usually pretty gimped compared to the full potential tank.last but not least this also works on other ships. ceptors e.g. so you can have a double eccm stiletto waiting in a safe to land tackle or just gather intel.i wonder if we will ever see a day where people dont whine."
3/10/2010,unscannable ships are about as harmless as afk cloakers
3/10/2010,"so in short the whine here is about not being able to ninja salvage a t3 mission runneri never liked that ninja mechanic... so im fine with thatbut maybe the op is right and that might, just might need looking atanything else that can be acomplished with an unscanable ship can also be acomplished with any ship with cloakplease next time, dont hide your whine behind so much text"
3/10/2010,"out of curiousity and since you seem to be all about balance, what is the counter to ninjaing?"
3/10/2010,"since 80% of my current income comes from missioning, you are looking at the wrong direction about ninjas and similar.they are despisable individuals but ccp decided to support their ""miniprofession"".if everyone else has to be subject to them, why some should not?afk cloakers cannot farm plexes under someone else's face though.salvaging while doing the mission is a good start.shooting the wrecks at least denies them the stuff but i have yet to resort to it due to the above.persistent pests are usually fixed by warping out and getting them killed.no, the unscannable ship breaks an eve principle, that is everything has a counter.if they made say a 1b module that can be the only one that can be fitted and only on another t3 ship and that 1b module allows to track an unscannable ship, then there would be a counter. sure it'd be used very few times but the principle would be restored."
3/10/2010,"you can not probe out the ship. but you can probe out the plex, the anomaly, the drones (some people are stupid enough for that).you can wait for them on gates, you can wait for them on stations.they made some effort to make your life harder, but it is not impossible to catch them. so you have to put some effort in to get the kill.if you want easy kills, run missions."
3/10/2010,"ummm, so your solution for someone doing say, level 3 missions is to fit salvagers and tractor beams on their caracal and race the ninjaer to them, or let me guess, they should l3 on marauders? . but you find it ridiculous when someone suggests to catch t3's at the gate?oh, and destroying your own wrecks isn't a counter. it's just trying to spite someone for stealing your wreck while spiting your own self in the process."
3/10/2010,"unscannable ships are used for two things:missions in hostile areassafe gang bonuseshow is the first bothering you? their efficiency is significantly cut down and they can be caught. patience is a virtue.the second instance, needs looking into. but imo this is more a problem with ships giving bonuses off grid, than it is unscannable ships.as stated, unscannable ships cannot run plexes with immunity as you can simply scan out the signature."
3/10/2010,"they ""farm"" intel with impunity which is what they're there to do in the first place.see my response above.this isn't a counter. this hoping, wishing, and praying that the ninja salvager is stupid enough to not warp away if he can't tank npc rats.try again with ninja salvaging. none of your suggestions were valid. or, they are as good a suggestion as the ones you were provided to counter unscannable ships ."
3/10/2010,"... salvage before they do? or get a friend to do it for you (very new players make great slave labour, they don't want for much )?laziness is no excuse."
3/10/2010,exactly. if someone is too lazy for not wanting to use a properly set up gatecamp to catch t3's at the gate that isn't an excuse either. under a properly set up gatecamp no ship is immune.
3/10/2010,"when the cry goes out that a t3 has been found near your space, you end up with enough people in a fleet to properly catch that ship. a t3 ship showing up in someone's space draws the same attention as a faction bs, or capital ship. people are willing to bubble and reinforce poss to get them. the only two places where a t3 ship has a dramatic advantage is in low sec and when traveling rapidly through low sec or 0.0.if you want to make them scannable, then all cloaked ships should be scannable, which would be one of the biggest nerfs ever."
3/10/2010,"cloaked ships can't fire weapons, use ganglinks, etc.especially those t3 fleet boosters are invincible on a safe spot. there is a reason why ganglinks can't be activated while warping after all. you can simply exploit this mechanic by using an unprobable ship. this should be considered an exploit!"
3/10/2010,"wait... what? it can't be probed because it is cloaked. if it is cloaked, the gang links aren't on. if it isn't cloaked, you can find it with probes."
3/10/2010,read the whole thread pls. you can make ships unprobable (without using cloak) by raising your sensor strength to 108% of your signature radius. can easily be done with the correct subsystem of t3 ships and some eccm modules. you even can fit 2 command processors and 3 ganglinks along with covert ops cloaking and interdiction nullifier (good at gates on your way to safespots). perfect gang booster character that is unprobable and has cov ops cloak.
3/10/2010,"unture, in real life there are somethings you can find or scan for, so it should be in eve...."
3/10/2010,"false. they can still be probed. it is harder to do. but if you are hunting down a ss gang booster during a fleet fight, you are probably doing it wrong. there are far better uses for your time even if it was a triple extender fleet command ship. besides, with hundreds of ships zipping around (as they warp-in/out) you aren't going to find a single ship very easily unless it was titan-sized."
3/10/2010,"nope, if it's signature to sensor strength ratio is under 1.08 then with no skills and equipment you'll be able to get a warpable result on it.in reality even that much isn't required, because really, how many probers have full virtue sets in their clone?i don't see anything wrong in ship that can't be scanned though it gives more advantage then a cloak but it gimps your setup more then cloak too"
3/10/2010,"sounds to me that if there is a problem then it is with gang links, not t3 themselves.so perhaps the thread should be about nerfing gang links and at least your arguments would be consistent. not that i think there's a problem with those either. but you're better off arguing that gang links are overpowered.the fact is:cloaked ships in hostile territory collect useful intel with impunity. this is working as intended.t3 ships can boost sensor strength to be unscannable while plexing (working as intended).where they differ: gang link bonuses."
3/10/2010,"going _beyond_ 100% sensor strength cannot be ""working as intended"". it's like pretending to have > 100% damage resistance (enemies give you hp!).the only reason ccp has not closed this exploit (that is smart use of game mechanics) is because they could not entice people to bother with their labor intensive t3 and so they dropped an huge hook.now they sold the t3 concept, they may as well close the hole, which imho should figure on their internal cvs as pure bug (ie letting modules stack beyond the maximum possible)."
3/10/2010,"you're still evading the issue. now you're nit-picking sensor strength beyond 100% which isn't an argument in on itself. you've failed to address the arguments above, but i'll bite this one anyway.if indeed is an unintended oversight as you claim it is, then they can always cap it at 100%.what i don't understand is how you could possibly argue that cloaks are working as intended (collecting intel) when there is no real counter to them and that t3s are broken for performing the very task they've been created to specialize in. you can't possibly ""fix"" one without fixing the other, as they are both doing their jobs as intended. and in my opinion neither can hurt you and both are gimped to pose any kind of serious threat.if you want to argue that gang links bonuses re broken, then you may be able to pose a better argument there. but the fact that you're avoiding the issue to basically just ""fix"" the one problem that bothers you is very hypocritical. i'm sorry, but that is just how it looks.bottom line is there is nothing overpowered about t3s."
3/10/2010,if it was just for me i'd nerf cloaks as well.
3/10/2010,i think you got some misconception there: 100% sensor strength doesnt exist. you can always add more eccm/backup arrays until you run out of slots (and friends for eccm projectors).
3/10/2010,"good idea, no reason to oppose this, easy to implement."
3/10/2010,"low sec will be pvp pirates attempting to catch ninja planet industry operators - hoping there is defense-attack. wormholes might become attractive for short term pos sestups go in deploy a pos harvest the planet for a while ( hoping different planets have different benefits) move materials out, will mean more movement and so forth but until we see the plans its simply speculation"
3/10/2010,"just thought when managing countless targets, a cycle current locked targets hot key would be very useful."
3/10/2010,"one problem in fleet warfare (especially so if fleet limits are increased: link) is the floods of broadcasts. generally, all logistics is in a gang/wing, so rr broadcasts should be sent to that specific gang/wing, not the entire fleet. generally, logistics is not shooting primary targets (and it can be highly annoying if a broadcast for reps is displayed, but when you click to lock, it has switched to a target broadcast), so they have no need to see what ship has been broadcast as primary.the proposal is for the fc to be able to set where broadcasts are sent. both top down broadcasts (i.e. targets are sent to everyone except x gang/wing) and bottom up broadcasts (i.e. rr broadcasts can be set to only go to a specific gang/wing). this may also reduce client lag during fleet fights (especially if fleet sizes are increased, as stated at the beginning of the post)."
3/10/2010,"there already is this little quite handy feature called broadcast filter, which you can use to ignore non-relevant broadcasts...."
3/10/2010,"which individual pilots have to set. the suggestion is to allow it to be set by the fc. if i understand the filter mechanic, your client is still receiving the broadcasts and removing the ones you don't want. if the fc sets the filter, it would be assumed to be set on the server, thus cutting down the load for the client.also, support."
3/10/2010,"please, ccp can we have a better contract indexing of blueprints -- especially to tell bpos from bpcs?a lag problem can exist just from folks having to click and inspect the all the [multiple items] sells, as it is. that's unnecessary database calls.just trying to find researched bpos with the right me and pe is work."
3/10/2010,"what your suggesting wont work for bpc's below battlecruiser value.why ?because your putting all the work on the seller as opposed to the buyer where it is now.if your expecting bp copiers to trawl through 100's or thousands of contracts , including lame offers and scam attempts for a few 100 thousand isk per shot you are living in a dream world.whats needed is a way to stack / unstack runs and the ability to sell bpc's on the market while keeping me/pe intact.more work for the devs this way i am sure , but better a solution than a half solution that wont work and will just end up wasting dev time."
3/10/2010,"proposal to add a second orbit @ range button to overview target.in combat there are generally two range designations that matter; tackle and skirmish.at tackle range you want to be close enough to hold point/scram/web. at skirmish range you want to be close enough to lock but out of range of point/scram/web.currently you can only set one orbit @ range. if you want to orbit at a different range than the one you have set you have to right-click/orbit at/set range, which takes precious time.it would be easier if you could just set a 2nd orbit at range button.it would also be nice if you could tie the orbit @ range to a ship fitting, so when you undock in a given ship it will know at which range you want to orbit rather than having to manually reset them every time."
3/10/2010,maybe check this thread
3/10/2010,"new ship idea. the trapper, a t2 battleship, based off of the interdictor skill requirements. prevents ships from cloaking.ship chassis: abaddon, rohk, hyperion, maelstrom.fitting:< t1 counterparts in dps and tank.special fitting: can fit a probe launcher, and a *decloak module*decloak module:acts like a smartbomb, but a much larger radius, up to 30km max, it works in waves, once you activate the module, it will give off one wave, and decloak all within the range. the reactivation time will be 3 minutes, then it may be fired off again. the module will not work nearby a starbase, or a stargate, to prevent people from anti cloak camps.thank you for reading, and i hope you like the ship idea."
3/10/2010,"how would the decloaking work? send out a wave that decloaks any people in range of it, or a constant effect, and im guessing the range would be dependent on the level of your skill of the ship among other things? sounds interesting. but i dont have enough experience with cloaks to really know. sounds fun thou, **** of a lot cloakers im sure."
3/10/2010,"brilliant! get out of my head, was just rowing my pod back to hq thinking about just such a setup."
3/10/2010,great idea.
3/10/2010,i mentioned a decloak bubble in another post as a reply. supported.
3/10/2010,"not supported. if it worked like a bubble it would be way too static and easy essentially nerfing cloaks beyond usefulness. keep in mind that sb's are active in an anti blobbing/rr bs roll, this would easily negate them in any situation where they could set up a firing run. what would perhaps be better would be something indicating the direction or location of cloaked ships on grid and then having to still de-cloak them the regular way with interceptors and drones etc.also obviously this is not against afk cloakers since they are on grid with you so don't suggest it is. second you make absolutely no argument otherwise for why this should be brought up at all, other then of course to nerf cloaks because they bother you. third you make no argument for why afk cloaking would be a problem even if this is what your ""solution"" addressed, which it doesn't.i really wish there was a thumbs down on these boards."
3/10/2010,"the way in which it would work like a bubble, is that in a range of 30km or less, you may activate the module, and it will decloak anyone within that 30km range, it would not scram or lower the velocity of any ship, it is merely for the sense of decloaking ships. i do not have anything against cloaking ships, but i believe it would be an interesting role, and a fun ship to fly. having a probe launcher, and being able to prevent enemies from cloaking would be a very fun experience to pvp in. i do not think this ship will nerf cloaks, but i think it will keep t3 cruiser pilots who may not be interdicted, and can covert ops cloak, from causing havoc without having much sense of worry when roaming continuously through enemy territory. also it would fill a role of preventing your fleet from getting stealth ganked. i think the ship idea seems versatile for those whom wish to low sec roam, or do corp ops in a multiple role battleship. because the other t2 battleships are hardly fit for roaming, or for broad fleet ops. a black ops ship is already extremely limited to its use, and a marauder is typically used for missioning.i believe the t2 battleship class needs to be looked into further, to find more useful roles in fleet ops that everyone can roam in, and that the heavy interdictor would be a very interesting ship to follow up on."
3/10/2010,maybe a bubble that visually shows a cloaked ship but you can't target. instead you need a ship to approach to decloak.
3/10/2010,rofl.not supported. this ship would become defacto standard in gate camps and render cloaks as option to bypass camps totally useless. we dont need to nerf covops and recons into uselessness.
3/10/2010,"how will this stop afk cloaking? you do know that afk cloakers are in a safespot that you can never probe out right? you do know that your decloak module would completely overpower gate camps and make getting dedicated cloaky scout ships impossible to move around 0.0, right? you do know the penalties of the t3 subsystems you talk about, right?if you make cloakers easily probable and decloakable then you might as well just remove the cloaking device altogether as what is the point."
3/10/2010,"if it's a blast with a greater than 5 minute cooldown, i support it. not a constant effect.also make the t2 hyper black!"
3/10/2010,this ship + hics = rofl?it's basically outright op.what about normal gate cloak?
3/10/2010,"even with just a pulse that thing is overpowered.example:you jump into their camp in your viator. align with mwd and cloak.currently it needs competent ceptor pilots to decloak and tackle you. good chance for them to catch you, but also a chance to run for you. (50/50 in my eyes)with his dreamed up t2 battleship: fire decloak impulse, ares/stiletto lands point on you and you are dead.chance for them: 100%chance for you: 0%same goes for recons, bombers, covops, hell even ships fitted with a normal cloak.he wants to get kills feeded without much work. skills and costs will not balance that thing out."
3/10/2010,"edited topic so that it prevents people from anti cloak camping, and makes the ship less op in the sense that it will completely nerf cloaks."
3/10/2010,"'press f1 to decloak hostiles' is the dumbest **** ever, no matter how many idiots propose it in here.edit: hah while i posted that he changed the op so it goes from 'brokenly overpowered' to 'utterly worthless'"

3/10/2010,i am no expert. but can't any cov ops cloaky ship uncloak when a ship undocks an lock him down and wait for backup to arrive? whocares if u got a window while docked if there are cloaky tacklers. could be bad for transports battleships and cap ships?
3/10/2010,"the idea would be that it's a module only interdictors could fit. if they chose to fit a cloaking device it would seriously mess with their lock time, so would probably only be capable of catching freighters and capitals at that point."
3/10/2010,"let us use the hundreds of windows on stations, then we'll talk. otherwise, undocking a suidical noob-alt to peek outside will become routine in lowsec."

3/10/2010,i'm not a fan of checking the sell forums for useful items only to find at least half of the posts are lottery spam.when i first started eve 3 years ago there was a bit but now that eve has so many players it's really gotten out of hand. :)
3/10/2010,"i am pirate, and yes, im -10, ive never tried to raise my sec status, because to be quite honets, i just like killing poeple and taking their stuff..now, -10 has penalties, you cant go to hisec, gate guns wont help you when people shoot you, anyone can kill you, anywhere, without fear of the law or security hits. people dont realise, being a pirate is one of the most dangerous careers in eve, it is a hard life and most pirates like it that way. eve was never meant to be played on 'easy' mode.all i see, many many times on the forums, is people who want lowsec to be made safe or some risk free play, well eve was never meant to be risk free, ever, not even hisec.lowsec is the place for pirates and criminals, if you cant take the heat, stay out. and for the record, most people in lowsec spend most of their time warring between each other, not sitting waiting for a hauler/miner/tourist to come to lowsec and be ganked. most gatecamps happen when the warring facrtions dont have fleets out killing each other, because making craebears cry is usually just a hobby to fill in the places between fleet fights with your enemy."
3/10/2010,"here's the thing though, yes, it's true, you can't go to hi sec safely, however, you can use an alt to mitigate this ""consequence"". and from the open admissions from pirates themselves they use alts to go shopping for them in hi sec. so i'm sorry, but this isn't hardship. it's a joke of a consequence.in reference to your comment about gate guns, well, let's be honest, they're not really doing much in lo sec. it's easy to tank their paper-wet dps. they don't hold you in place. you're free to warp away from them as you please. and they don't just shoot at -10s. they shoot at anyone with an aggression timer on them.piracy isn't one of the most dangerous careers in eve. i'm sorry but i just can't agree with you there. you know who i think have one of the most dangerous careers in eve? players looking to pve in lo sec. now that is risky. you see, the pirate chooses the target, not the other way around.""... it is a hard life and most pirates like it that way""i hear this all the time but it seems the carebear pirates only want it to be a hard life for the carebear, not themselves. and this is what i am trying to do, make it harder. but this doesn't sit well with pirates because well, it's making their life harder and it wasn't what they meant when they said eve is harsh and cold . the truth is that there aren't serious consequences to being a pirate. everything can be mitigated with an alt. so i'll ask you again, what is it that causes you serious hardship for being a pirate?your last paragraph i kinda agree with you, so no arguments from me there. only thing i can add is that when you freely engage a target (consensually) you can't count that as hardship or risk. if you engage by choice you're doing it for fun and you yourself are controlling that risk, even if you lose. get what i'm saying?"
3/10/2010,"it's a shame the op put so much effort in to this thread when there are perfectly good ideas on fixing the bounty hunting system that could do with a bump.see here#1while it'll never happen i quite like this idea, it would mean that by keeping your sec at about -1 you would have the advantages of being flashy red (extra fights in low sec) while still being allowed in to high sec.don't think that was the ops intention but that would be the result.#2yes for the love of god fix the bounty system, see above link.#3bad idea. the reason 'blobs' happen is because people like to play alongside their mates, this is hardly unreasonable in an mmo. anyone who solos regularly will know that it's not pvp it's pvppppppp and sets themselves up accordingly.if you're not willing to either bring friends or fight when outnumbered you're playing the wrong game.#4again a bad idea. this would mainly penalize -10 pilots and make wars between pirate groups very difficult. the end result would be large groups of pirates sitting on stargates ganking noobs to relieve the boredom.#5no. what you call carebear pirates i'd call casual pvpers and it's hard enough to encourage them in to low sec as it is, one mans blob is another mans target list and i want more targets not less."
3/10/2010,"1. absolutely. there needs to be more incentive for anti-piracy.2. absolutely. not so much for the reason you outlined; actually i would say that if the kill rights get transferred, it changes in the person's character sheet as well. but transferable kill rights (better bounty system) is definitely need.3. i don't particularly agree with this. what if its 10 frigates going after a battleship? 4. okay5. real pirates don't care.decent ideas but your motives of wanting carebear tears is sort of pathetic. grow up."
3/10/2010,"it's why i said #1 goes along with #5. if you keep shooting targets you won't be staying at -1 for long, considering it would be harder to rat your sec back up. i don't think you've completely understood the whole idea. you can't shoot non-neg players and expect to stay at -1, especially when i clearly also recommend making grinding sec status harder. this is mostly to discourage the part-time pirates that spend 3 days pirating and 2 days ratting their sec status back up.here's to hoping.this is understandable to a point. and as you say, pvpppppp is part of the game. but, the fact is this wouldn't affect -10 to begin with. it would only affect the part-time blobbers and i don't see how this is a bad thing. they could continue blobbing with all ten or thirty of their friends, but they just need to accept the consequences of a little harsher penalties. isn't this what eve is about? consequences for your actions?see above. we shouldn't be encouraging more blobs. and this change would still allow you the choice of bringing your blob anyway. just be prepared to take a sharper hit on sec status. it means there are now real consequences for blobbing.as opposed to docking and being bored regardless? i'm afraid i don't follow your logic here. troubling you a little bit for living the life of a pirate isn't against the spirit of the game. the whole point is to have real consequences for your actions. and adding a 15-minute aggro timer to a -10 pirate is a consequence you coudn't resolve with an alt. you have to weight out the timer. or perhaps you can think of something that could replace this idea. i'm open to suggestions. but it has to be something that cannot be mitigated by alts and that carries actual consequences, not a slap on the wrist.this changes would actually encourage them to stay in lo sec. you see, they'd stop playing yo-yo with their sec status and decide once and for all whether they pirate or carebear it up. and since these are likely players that enjoy blobs and ganks i'd say there's a better chance they'll go the dark side. not only that, but you have their attention in lo sec for the entire time, since grinding sec status would be more tedious and not worth it.i appreciate your feedback. thanks."
3/10/2010,"good point. however, ask yourself this. would it not be worth to consider if it reduces the number of blobs? it wouldnt affect players with -10s of course, but it would hopefully sway some of the yo-yo pirates concerned about their sec status in keeping their gangs to a minimum. after all, pvp is more fun when its quality, not quantity. and in the end youre still given the freedom to blob if you wish. just be prepared to accept the consequence of taking a harder sec status. i honestly dont see this being as game-breaking. but thats just my opinion and i respect yours.exactly. and this is what my ideas are aiming to do. if you decide to go the pirate route then it means youve decided not to care about your sec status and its consequences. but a pirate caring about his sec status and being able to manipulate his sec status to plunder then go about living like a regular citizen (yo-yo pirates) is kind of a slap in the face of the game mechanics and it also breaks game immersion.actually, the tears i was referring to were from carebear pirates or yo-yo pirates :p. i know there are some good mature pirates out there. but, from experience i can tell you there are lots, and i mean lots, of douches out there as well. dont take those comments to heart. theyre addressed to the idiots that abound these forums, not the actual people that have some respect and level of maturity. in any case, it doesnt seem like it applies to you.thanks for the comments o7."
3/10/2010,"i have only been playing eve for around 2 months including my buddy trial, and i overall enjoy the experience. i have, however, noticed something that could easily be improved. currently, there is no way to tell if someone is there or not to chat other than if you were around to see them type ""afk"" or ""in a battle"". any good messenger system (non-game, of course - i'm talking windows live hotmail or yahoo messenger here), has a status system to let other people know what that person is up to, and subsequently if they are available or not.i propose a system like this in eve - so that if we join a channel to find some information and the players are afk, we will not simply assume they are ignoring the chanel when they do not reply, and so that we can all easily tell who we can speak to and who we can't.i suggest such statuses as these:[*]available - for those who are at the keyboard, ready to type as and when[*]afk - for those who cannot type for whatever reason (food, toilet, whatever =p)[*]battling - for those in a battle and can only type at select times.[*]semi-afk - for those who are only checking their screens every now and then (such as when mining)the system for changing your status could be a simple right click of your name or character sheet and selecting the drop down menu ""status"", then selecting which, or programmable keyboard short cuts.because this is for other people to know, there would also have to be a visual queue or marker for each type of status - their name could be in different writing in the right side (members area) of the chat window, for instance.i ask anyone to post supporting this proposal, and suggesting improvements over my ideas.thanks"

3/10/2010,i hate the wasp playstyle ... so ... no
3/10/2010,what the hell are you talking about?
3/10/2010,"no, roids were worse designed, but flashed of a nice light when lasers hit them :dmining brings in too many resources vs how many are consumed.any change they do, requires a massive nerf on how much material comes in game (including nerfing missions, whs and 0.0 sov spawned belts).any improvement to make mining better and more interesting will just make more people do it, worsening the long standing situation where insurance fraud is the only option to make minerals leave the game.mining needs an automation nerf (aka making it interactive) and a global yield nerf - less than other mining professions though (beginning with l4 missioning, i am making double the minerals with missioning than with 2 t2 fit hulks + bonuses. plus i make lots of mega and zydrine, no way it can be done by an hi sec miner)."
3/10/2010,"how does this not fit into the category of ""ccp should review mining""?"
3/10/2010,"i imagine this would function much like full implant sets - granting a nice bonus but perhaps having more mediocre performance on their own?care would have to be taken to make sure that the set bonuses make sense though - i can imagine the .05% active armor tank bonus ccp will give the federation navy set already, for instance"
3/10/2010,"i would support this idea if it worked for pvp only - since this set bonus would encourage people to fit more faction gear, and thus result in greater loot and more excitement in pvp.if it's just used by the carebears to grind their level 4s - no, they are too easy as it is.but either way, it's highly unlikely ccp would do anything that increases risk or losses in pvp."
3/10/2010,"nice idealike other people pointed out it would have some balancing issuesso how about a heat bonusmake the ""set"" generate less heat. not game breaking, but still usefull."
3/10/2010,when it came time to review the myriad of things passed by previous csm's i personally poked about rockets (and the af 4th bonus).soon (tm)
3/10/2010,"thank you good sir, may your rocket live long and poke lots."
3/10/2010,"remember: the more exclimations (for bonus points use 1's) after an idea, the better it is."
3/10/2010,"eve already is an eq/wow grindfest, where your wallet represents your experience level. just ask any leet pvp'er how much they enjoy their level 4 mission alt.not that i'm supporting the op, i'm just sharing my perception."
3/10/2010,supported.
3/10/2010,"actually, while we're at it, can we please make it so that you are never ever offered the same mission twice in a row? it gets a bit tedious when you get ""unauthorized military presence"" three times in a row. don't get me wrong, i like the mission, but i it just feels a bit pointless after th esecond time around."
3/10/2010,"it can be frustrating to get that one ""haul 20,000 m3 of stuff to low sec"" mission. it would be extremely annoying to get it again after declining it."
3/11/2010,"black op are mostly ok as is, could use a few changes in its class though to make them more cool.changes i'd like to see:1. give them better t2 resistances2. give them more damage+tracking etc bonuses - remove cloaked velocity if you have to, who uses it?3. better targeting range and sensor resolution3. longer jump range? sure why not"
3/11/2010,yes :d
3/11/2010,please revisit these ships to make them worth the price tag.
3/11/2010,"i see part of your difficulty, i believe it's been repeatedly stated that changing the lock limit isn't going to happen and this makes sense given the effect this would have on lag and server load so while many of us are working under the assumption that we have to work with the lock limit as an unchangeable limitation you're not. so yes 249km is well within an apoc's lock limit, 274 not so much but 249 is the number we have to work with.sure this may be the case but it would require unraveling years worth of balance, starting with the whole concept of having the disadvantage of lasers be cap use, then making most of their ships half that very cap use, not a very practical solution and thus we're left with working with what we have. you've still failed to actually explain where railguns have a meaningful advantage compared to lasers as i've stated the many advantages beams have and how few rails have as a result.your baseline just happens to be the worst sniper out there, the fact that you didn't know this speaks volumes to your lack of experience and understanding and as tagami's pointed out the fact that you haven't read the thread or it's predecessor."
3/11/2010,"the fact that the mega is a crappy sniper, the rokh does no damage, and the hyperion is mediocre at best [dps as a function of range - looking at alpha strike is even more shocking]... wouldn't this prove the point we've been trying to make all along? railguns need to be improved."
3/11/2010,"my god, yees!"

3/11/2010,"ahh i was mistaken, i apologize"

3/11/2010,"so what happens when you decline all the possible missions? actually, that's a great idea. leave angel extravaganza or your favourite other mission. :-)"
3/11/2010,"the only mission that you should not get is the one mission that you previously declined immeadiately before requesting a new mission. this does not stop an agent from cycling through two or more missions that you keep declining, nor does it prevent the agent from offering the mission within the 4 hours of declining it provided that another mission is offered immeadiately after the first time the original mission was declined."
3/11/2010,fanny batter.
3/11/2010,"first, i never whined about anything you may want to look in a mirror to find that. i stated what ccp has already made perfectly clear, a 1 minute logoff timer is in place to reduce the chances of a legitimate disconnect resulting in the destruction of a players assets. the op and the people supporting his first item are whining that 1 minute isn't long enough to kill a target. anything can be killed in less than a minute if enough firepower is available but a player can't avoid legitimate disco which is why the rule exists. that doesn't mean i support people using this tactic to avoid losing assets but since doing so is considered an exploit then it is up to you to petition the offending party not me and everyone else to lose our ships because of a legitimate disco and you and yours not getting a kill because you were unprepared to dish out the firepower needed to pull it off.so in summary. you have multiples avenues to deal with item 1 while legitimate disco's have no way to stop a legitimate disco so they shouldn't pay the consequences and ccp agrees."

3/11/2010,you are basing everything that occurs in eve off of lowsec and .0 pvp. unfortunately for you the vast majority of eve doesn't live and operate in either of those spaces. so when a noob in a frigate jumps into his level 1 mission and doesn't get killed because of a legitimate disco it's because this rule is in place due to the fact that a huge majority of paying eve customers face this issue every day. this rule is backed up by rules specifically designed to stop people from using this mechanic as a way losing your ship. there is nothing broken here except for the fact that people are not reporting it as they should be. instead they come whine about it in the assembly hall.yes it's frustrating but ccp isn't going to make 3/4 of it's paying customers ****ed off because 1/100th of them disco on purpose.
3/11/2010,"what saves the noob in this case is ""emergency warp"" that happens immediately after disconnect.nobody here is proposing any changes to emergency warp. your point is moot."
3/11/2010,wrong there is warp jamming in some missions.
3/11/2010,"what saves the noob is 2 minute aggro from npc. no one here proposed any changes to that. also no one here proposed to remove emergency warp or making ships stay for more than 1 or 2 minute if they don't have aggro.if you don't know that ""player"" aggro and ""npc"" aggro are different things with different timers that are triggered differently, then go learn basic game mechanics before posting such posts."
3/11/2010,please provide evidence of level 1-2 missions that have warp scrambling rats
3/11/2010,"it doesn't matter, because he doesn't understand that in this topic no one proposes to make npc aggro timer to reset itself even if player logoffs. the whole talk is about player vs. player aggro timer.for every one who doesn't know: if npc shoots at you, you've got 2 minute ""npc aggro"" - if you logoff, your ship will be present in game for 2 minutes (it will either warp out or will stay in place for that time if npcs have scrambled you).on the other hand, player vs. player interaction (shots, warp disruptors, ecm, etc.) places on you 15 minute aggro.the whole bug is that if you logoff and player places aggro on you after that, you still disappear after 1 minute. but no one here proposes to make that if npc shoots you after logoff (or disconnect) to make you ship stay for 15 minutes! people who think that this is proposed in this topic are just don't know even current game mechanics."
3/11/2010,"you are right jeremey, the proposed changes have no effect on carebear that doesn't get attacked by another player.the main problem is people logging off literally seconds before they see incoming aggro. and as i said earlier, the probability of real disconnect in that case is less than 1:10000"
3/11/2010,major support.
3/11/2010,"the misconception is in the inhumane efforts spent to avoid pvp at all costs, in the top non consensual pvp game of all. from that misconception come the need to invent all sorts of ""principles"", all sort of ""parables"", all sorts of nitpickings."
3/11/2010,"your entire argument is fundamentally flawed and shows a severe misunderstanding of the game. some examples:- being unprobeable wasn't introduced ex post facto - it actually included in the first introduction of the scanning system and people found ways to make it happen with t3s (along side many ships up to battlecruiser sized).- capping sensor strength vs sig radius means that you cap how well someone can resist being jammed. smooth move there, slick.- becoming unprobeable comes with significant sacrifices - a ""tight specialization"" if you will. this is a significant enough penalty that i'd wonder if they wouldn't make more isk in high sec than missioning in 0.0/lowsec. especially if they fit the covops mod and interdiction nullifier.- being unprobeable doesn't offer many advantages over being cloaked from a pvp perspective. you can't effectively attack someone, but you can give bonuses and collect intel in local. well, i suppose i have to give this one to the cloaked ship seeing as how it can do all that but doesn't so significantly affect its actual combat abilities.- dealing with unprobeable mission runners (this seems to be your primary beef) is extremely easy. they are still vulnerable on gates and stations, and people regularly kill recons on gates and stations and t3 are not any different. to put it bluntly, if you can't kill an unprobeable ship in your stomping grounds, it's because you fail.- complaining about someone having nor isk of ninjaing or item stealing is pretty ****ing lol. there's lots of ways to do that, and my golem has never had anyone enter the mission and steal loot or salvage.- t3 has a much heftier penalty for loss. show me another ship that forces skillpoint loss.-liang"
3/11/2010,"i know this, and does not change it should not be possible to do it, on any ship.actually i always found it quite peculiar that boosting sensor strength on yourself you affect another stat, but i suppose this is just another residual of who knows what ancient past.if it was significant enough, people would not apply it on every opportunity.never said being cloaked should not be looked at all of its advantages and eventually nerfed. it's another escamotage to reward for no risk after all.because safe spots don't exist and you must dock with the t3 ship even just to get more ammo, no way you could do that with an alt in a cheaper ship. oh wait...recons are strong ships but don't go beyond ""the rules"" after all. killing a t3 on a gate? i dare say it might be harder.apparently, the ""can't kill an unprobeable ship"" works so well that everyone and their dog fit that kit.it's like nano again or like falcons again. when it becomes a must to do a certain way, it means the game is imbalanced towards that way and you know that sooner or later it will get axed.nevertheless, for every blatantly overpowered feature, there's always a fat group of benefitters who find it just fine.what i can read here is really nothing, nothing new that i have not found in the many years i play mmos. a new game feature is introduced, insufficient testing does not let the developers cover every hole and of course there's a mob of people working 24/7 to find every possible opening to take advantage. of course they find it perfect, fine and appropriate to use these misfeatures and will beat on everyone who is not hypocrital enough to join the clapping mob.yup, you have to use some very, very basic diligence in your golem though. that's what makes the golem fine.the loss is because you fly a small signature yet powerful and tanked ship, not because you are permitted to circumvent being found."
3/11/2010,"i've seen lots of requests for unprobeable mission runners, but very few in space. and the ones i've seen in space i can probe. i think you're jumping at theoretical shadows here.nerfing cloaking also nerfs the ability of the few to wage war against the many in *any* fashion. i'd be -1 to a cloak nerf.because missions are all in the same system and you don't have to dock to get more missions, and involving more than one character doesn't always bring more advantages..... oh wait...dare say it all you want, it doesn't change the fact that it's not any harder than killing a recon - and in some ways it's actually easier. but in the end all your post is boiling down to is bbbbbaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwww!!! besides, don't you have 7b isk to pay off before you can waste our time about how you fail at pvp?yep, all the pve threads are about unprobeable tengus. that's right folks, you heard it here. haven't seen a cnr/raven/domi/abaddon/paladin/nightmare/nighthawk/caracal/drake/bomber/blah pve thread in months!oh, and btw, i *do* choose to be scannable (and not in a tengu no less!) in hostile systems so that i can have an edge in pve. whoops because nobody does that.yes, because nobody has ever been able to fly around in good small ships before. -liang"
3/11/2010,"i do lvl3 missions with a myrmidon. it has tractor and salvager on it. i did some lvl3 with a vexor (even ""probing question""), it had a salvager."
3/11/2010,"setups with great sensor strength should be much harder to probe (like they're harder to jamm), not completely immune."
3/11/2010,"that's the whole point of the thread. you are not meant to see them in space, they would not even buy a t3 if you could.at dr we started in like 5-10 people in early 2009 and ended in 150 men fleets by nov 2009.failure to attract players with a solid corp should not be hedged by using a module imho.edit: this thread is not about cloak, why do you keep trying to derail it into that?also, cloak is a solution to some game problems (i.e. how to find out enemy weaknesses etc), and has no ""limits"" or numbers to be violated. ie ccp planned cloaks and they just work, like them or not. unscannable t3 instead play exactly with elder mechanics with parameters that can be violated (exploited to be more appropriate) to achieve something originally not intended to become so. last time i checked, you don't have to dock in a t3 to turn in a mission.oh, but by missioning (the other overpowered thing you frothe at the mouth to defend so much) i am half done already.with 1 bpc + minerals + some self made t2 modules and a 150k shield (what is it in total?), in 2 hours a day, i am earning almost 30% a month of what varo jan is earning with a 150 billions investment in the research alliance he purchased.of course those inties and cov ops have a battleship-alike tank and gank!that's exactly my whole point."
3/11/2010,then the same should be for cloaking.
3/11/2010,"i don't see any parallels or logic here, care to explain?"
3/11/2010,cloaks/recons have the ability to collect valuable intel in null sec and even prey on miners/ratters. it's what they're for. and they also cannot be probed.if your argument is that it isn't fair some ships cannot be probed then logically your argument should also extend to recons not being able to be probed. why would you include one and exclude the other?
3/11/2010,"i wasn't going to comment on this issue, just because i know nothing i say is going to convince anyone of anything - but whatever. i've never been known for my ability to keep my mouth shut, even when i should.i found this loadout on battle clinc of an unprobable loki that had received decent ratings (23+, 0-)."
3/11/2010,"then why wouldn't you fit cloak to your missionrunning ship instead of loads of eccms? because it doesn't allow you to do anything except for flying around?when you fit eccms - you should sacrifice efficiency of your ship, gaining more time to bail when you see probes (not to become completely immune to them, because your ship is still able to do various things including killing npcs). when you fit cloak - you reduce pve/gang boosting efficiency of your ship to zero, making it impossible to scan you. i don't see any irrationality here."
3/11/2010,"why does your sensor strength have anything to do with how difficult it is to probe you down? that's what i would like to know. why isn't it simply a function of your sig radius? if ccp just changed the equation, none of this would be an issue. if you want to disappear, use a cloak."
3/11/2010,"because just as a recon ship needs to be cloaked in order to perform its job properly (its why its called a recon) an npcing setup t3 needs sensor boosters to npc properly (i.e., what it's meant for). the bonus of the dissolution sequencer applies to eccm modules, not cloaks. its like fitting eccm on a recon instead of the covert ops cloak. why would you do that?then youll be happy to know you are sacrificing efficiency. run a plex with max tank/gank and then run the same plex with eccms fit instead. compare results. when t3 ships fit eccm modules they are gimping their tank/gank. they cannot hurt you and therefore will not be a threat to you.recons arent specialized in pve/gang boosting, therefore the fact that they lose efficiency in those areas is irrelevant. what they dont lose efficiency in even when cloaked is the ability to recon (i.e. gather intel). in fact, because they are cloaked they are invulnerable and thus able to perform their job at a much higher efficiency!d.c."
3/11/2010,"you can still catch it on gates or stations.no. and id say its still isnt enough when you take into consideration that t3s are around 500m and cost you 4 days of training when you die.its understandable that pve ship is avoiding pvp. but player still have to dock/jump the gate to complete mission, get new missions, refit and get ammo = it definitely isnt invulnerable.it isnt standard, you are giving up alot of ships potential by making it unprobeable.its counter to this mechanic. again, you are giving up alot of ships potential by countering ninjaing through making ship unprobeable.no. generally - its a whine of 'pvper' /hard to call ppl who hunt down pve ships real pvpers/ who is not able to probe down mission runners in system he lives and is too lazy to do a proper camp."
3/11/2010,"well looking at figures in eft (which i hate doing cause it isn't really testing ideas) and looking at only third tier bs's in a remote rep role these are results i found (all lvl 5 skills no implants).abaddon: dps.......920 @ 15(+10)km (tracking 0.04129)tank......150k ehp with a defence efficiency of 394 (omni damage) with a single remote armour rephyperion:dps.......1085 @ 4.5(+13)km (tracking 0.07036)tank......110k ehp with a defence efficiency of 253 (omni damgae) with a single remote armour reprohk:dps.......906 @ 6.8(+13)km (tracking 0.05412)tank......117k (124k w invul overloaded) ehp with a defence efficiency of 394 (431 ol'd invul)with a single remote shield repmaelstrom:dps.......1021 @ 3.5 (+31)km (tracking 0.05913)tank.....95k (100k with invul ol'd) ehp with a defence efficiency of 268 (298 invul ol'd) with a single remote shield repnow if we apply the idea of increasing the ammount of rr the hyperion and maelstrom recieve, say 7.5% / bs level the eft defence efficiency figures would be far closer to their competitors. does anyone bleive this would create an imbalance or do youthink that it gives the hyp and mael a fleet role instead of just relegating them to solo/very small gang work as the local rep bonus becomes useless vs more than 2 or three ships.so in summary.... what this thread would be requesting is that the active tank bonus be increase to 10% per lvl of armour repairer/ shield boost ammount and 7.5% bonus to rr recieved but only in armour for hype and shield for mael."
3/11/2010,"hmm compared to rokh vs maelstrom i see no reason to boost the mael,maybe after a blaster boost. so it is clr that maelstroms bonuses are fine-->no need for this active tank bonus boost."
3/11/2010,yup
3/11/2010,"gotta love amarr eh naomi? they get the dps, the range advantage, the buffer and the rr and active tanking advantage. the maelstrom requires 150% more remote reppers to be on par with the abaddon's remote rep tanking ability. the maelstroms dps is actually the same as the abaddons at 15km. the hype does almost the same using null at 15km. unfortunatly the rokh fails here too. doing only 80% the dps the other three ships offer . so if the active tank boost goes forward the rokh will need a boost to increase shield to compensate. it all needs balancing out but we'll find a way in the end"
3/11/2010,sorry i'm a moron... didn't have any drones in the rokh!.... updated above post
3/11/2010,"also, change the hype to 10% shield boost ammount per level pretty please. real men fit neutrons and four mag stabs."
3/11/2010,"+1, my main flys a tri-rep, dual boosted myrm. this will make my tank 2ez4lowsec ;)"
3/11/2010,"oh it seem different now. so giving 7.5%/lvl for incoming remote rep is fine with me ,but not this 10%/lvl the op wants.btw it seems that armor tank >> shield ,what a surprise,maybe ccp should do something about that too.like increasing the base shield resists a little bit."
3/11/2010,i agree that 10% is a little too much. maybe 9% per level is a better figure (end result is 7.5% better @ lvl5 than current.9%/lvl remote rep recieved looks like an excellent fix for the disparity between the resist bonus and the local boost bonus (according to eft this would give slightly higher defence efficiency on a single remote rep than a ship with the resist bonus). i've only been checking out battleships with this idea and it looks perfect.yes the rokh needs either a slight boost to base shield resists or a boost to base shield ammount to balance it all out with a good buffer. i would prefer the latter as better resists = better rr tanking.
3/11/2010,"not supporting because this is just nit-picking. no offense, i'd rather tackle problems with gameplay and not worry too much about game description."
3/11/2010,"this was posted already, and no.a) if you don't mine which is like 95% of the forum users you remove containers from the overview and you won't see them, amazing.b) miners don't macro with cans, at least very few do why bother, a simpler macro would be to:mine, fill hold, dock, unload ore-, undock,-warp to belt, and repeat. over mine, enter password for container, transfer ore to container, mine, transfer ore to container,--repeat until full, dock, switch ships, undock, warp to container, open container, transfer ore, dock, unload ore, -switch ships, warp to container, mine-repeat. or you could go bother a corp with people willing to fight over new miners using cans to make some isk."

3/11/2010,"the capital class interdictor would be something you did not field regularly, and that you did not field lightly. it would have a hefty price tag being a t2 variant of an already existing capital ship. it would not carry any sort of weapon system or even be able to self sustain the scripted version of it's interdiction bubble without carriers or sc to aid it. these ships would share the jump range of a dread and would not be deployable in low sec. costing in the range of 3-7b mineral cost and not being insurable past it's t1 counterpart a capital interdictor would be something used when you have the upper hand and absolutely do not want the hostile fleet escaping. sporting several times the hp of a dread or carrier and dual defensive bonuses(resists and local rep) the ship is designed purely to soak fire and keep hostile ships locked down over a larger area than previously possible. it would not have the massive hp of a sc or titan but would be enough to soak fire with the aid of reps from your fleet. the normal unscripted bubble of the capital interdictor would extend out to a 40km radius, cycle every 30 seconds using a high amount of cap. the bubble would cause the ship to become immobile and increase it's agility/mass by 16 fold so you could not effectively bump it out of your way. after the bubble is disengaged either by the pilot or forcefully by nueting the ship would be unable to warp for 1 minute afterwards or jump for 10. the scripted variant would extend to an 80km radius and would require significantly more cap than the ship could generate for more than a very short burst without the aid of carriers or sc supporting it. scripting also reduces the cap recharge by 75% and has all the same effects as the unscripted bubble. in short- t2 version of dread or carrier(probably carrier)- 3-7b to be determined by the dev designing it- several times the hp of it's t1 counterpart- only as insurable as any other t2 ship- 7.5% repair bonus per level, 5% resist bonus per level- 40km radius bubble unscripted. immobile while activated and for 1 minute afterwards- unable to jump for 10 minutes after deactivation- scripted 80km radius. 75% reduced cap recharge.- no additional high slots to discourage cap transfering several to create cap out of thin air and be self sufficient without support."

3/11/2010,"this move would have a bad long term effect.knowing they'd be unable to escape, enemies would:- desist from attacking (pvp becomes sparser)- only attack with an huge-tastic fleet surely able to crush yours. blobs just got worse- pvp recover would become longer (again, pvp becomes sparser) because wiping out the entirety of the enemy makes them longer to rebuild / rebuy all.- you just killed guerrilla tactics.only positive effect is if you have a major alliance able to relentlessy steamroll everything with no hope of defense. basically a star wars empire deathstar + interdictors."
3/11/2010,"1) people have said this with hictors as well, and dictors, and pos, and dominion, and many other things. people aren't going to stop pvping simply because you have a larger bubble. if you have placed your capital fleet inside a bubble i would say you encouraged a fight not discouraged one. you can anchor a few t2 larges and actually cover more space than this for far less cash and people do. 2) hi, maybe you haven't looked at supercaps, which require blobs to counter more than 1 or 2 already. the lawlblob response is dumb and antiquated. every major war in history has been won by a blob and it won't stop just because you hate fleet pvp3) or it causes an alteration of tactics and people who routinely use caps in ******ed fashions without support fleets find themselves without a cap fleet regardless of it's size. 4) uh, no i didn't. this isn't a grid wide bubble. i am sorry you can not go point blank with 60 rr bs when one of these bubbles is up and get out immediately. again it only stops them if the person is using them defensively which means their capital fleet is inside a bubble."
3/11/2010,"by your own admission, the capital hictor would be here so that ""a minmatar bs cannot kill it"" etc etc. this means you want to not stop pvping but the others would. otherwise they would not focus on hics to flee.high value assets are made to be weak and need to be defended, unless you can pretend to have capital falcons and similar.hey i can be accused of many things but with my signature, how can you say i hate fleet pvp? then a cure is to nerf caps or make this t2 hic only affect caps. that would save the small fries and smaller skirmishes would still be viable.in general your post seems about the ""bad mechanics"" of the game (ie heavy handed usage of rr, capacitor tricks, capitals abuse...) more than about bringing in a fresh ship.why not putting steep diminishing returns in stuff that already exists then?"

3/12/2010,"okay boys and girls, i've re-read whole thread and noticed that almost everyone who opposes these changes uses 'what happens if i get real disconnect' argument, so let's look a bit deeper into it.when you get disconnected, server stops getting data from client; to make sure that connection is really lost it waits for 30 or 60 seconds before making emergency warp-off, and only after that moment you're considered as logged off (opposed to insta-logoff using ctrl-q).---1. you logoff and after that someone places aggro on you - but you will still disappear after 1 minute.there're really 2 cases in this single point: 1.1. after jumping into some system through gate and 1.2. all others. major difference is 45-60 seconds of cloaked state which provides you total invulnerability after jumping into some gate.1.1. if you've got legit disconnect in gate cloak - most likely you'll be able to avoid aggro and if you have enough tank your ship will vanish in 1 minute. in this case suggested mechanics change will affect you in some edge cases. but personally i think number of 1.1.1. legit disconnects in fat ships which can survive camp is absolute minority when compared to 1.1.2 number of legit disconnects in cases where your ship won't be able to tank campers (you'll die with 1 minute aggro the same way you'd die with 15 minutes aggro) plus number of forced logouts which are done just to keep your ship 'alive'1.2. there're numerous situations, but let's take some fat ship in the belt, say, orca and group of hulks. they noticed few interceptors en-route to their belt and have no time to align and warp to pos (at least that's true for orca). they log off right when interceptors land into their belt, and if gang doesn't have enough dps arriving instantly after interceptor to the belt - most of miner guys will survive. if they had real disconnect - they'd be aggroed before server issues log off after time out is reached. in this case, it won't help players which got really disconnected.---2. you logoff, login, logoff, login - and appear on a spot not where you was or where you're travelling previously.that's pretty obvious that it's impossible to make this trick (especially multiple times) without insta-logoff, which is not the case with real disconnect where time out should expire before actual logoff.---3. you click warp to and instantly logoff - no one can scramble you or even lock you.same. if you click warp and hit log off - this trick works. if you click warp and get disconnected - you will be aggroed and killed.sooo, is 'what happens if i get real disconnect' argument that strong? i don't think so, really :p"
3/12/2010,"everything you wrote in your post is quite right, but just small remark: it seems that eve uses tcp/ip (and not asynchronous udp), so server doesn't literally waits for client data - it's just notified when tcp/ip connection is timed out (as i can say from my programming experience without touching the game itself, of course).from practical standpoint we can say that during ""legit"" disconnect (not closing game client by ctrl-q) the server just waits 30-60 seconds for client data."
3/12/2010,step 1: log in and get into a fightstep 2: pull the ethernet cable out of your computerstep 3: rinse and repeat.weak argument my ass... server will never be able to discern the difference between a logoffski and a disconnect.stop theorizing and talking about things you know nothing about people.yes its a problem... but the suggested solutions will cause more harm than you ever thought possible.just wait until it happens to you... i guarantee you will be first one to scream at ccp.it only takes one incident... just one.ps: and before you flame me note i supported this proposal.. so shove that up your missile tube.
3/12/2010,"anyone who had legitimate disconnect during battle (as i have) knows that the current mechanism doesn't benefit you at all. you fight, you disconnect, you log back in 30 seconds later - your ship is dead.or you fight, you disconnect, by some miracle you weren't scrambled, you warp to safe, you log back in 30 seconds later, warp back into enemy gang, weakened, and probably die.or you fight, you disconnect, you can't log back in cause of serious internet problems, but by some miracle your ship wasn't scrambled. so the enemy probes you down in 2-5 minutes and you die anyway.the only way to get any benefit from this is to exploit the system purposely."
3/12/2010,"have you read what others wrote here? we talking about that if server (or devs) cannot descern between legitimate logoff and cutting your ethernet cable, then logoff should not give advantages in/during pvp.also, if logoff happened not during pvp (so player doesn't have 15 minute aggro timer), proposed changes will have no effect on him.what harm exactly fixing these bugs will cause? please be more specific when making such statements.no, i think it is fair that if you've disconnected in the middle in the fight - you die (if enemy have scrambled and shooting you with enough dps).thank you for clarification, that is exactly about what i'm talking about too."

3/12/2010,"your problem seems to be with alts. but your real intention is to nerf something you can't gank with your pvp ship while it's at its most vulnerable, doing pve. so ccp comes up with a ship that counters that and naturally now you want a counter to that counter.this isn't a problem inherent to t3 ships. in fact, this isn't a problem at all. but you're better off arguing that placing too many hi quality agents in one system creates an unfair ability to pick and choose missions. but like i said, your true motive and gripe is not being able to gank pve ships with your pvp gank squad of death. but you won't say this. you come under different pretenses. but meh, whatever.on paper? have you even ever tried stuffing a t3 with eccm and compared its efficiency with a non-eccm version? you don't seem to even understand you're giving up dps and tank. you say you're a mission runner, but are you really? from what you say you don't seem to run missions a lot.and by ""game long term good"" you really mean be able to gank even the one ship that specializes in countering attacks to a pve setup. gotcha."
3/12/2010,"i'm talking about pve aspect only here. titan also can bridge ships from safety, performing its role well, recons/covops can too (but guess what? covops don't have bubble immunity subsystem and can be caught easily after jumping to other systems by some nice camp).and - dissolution sequencer doesn't boost eccm bonus, it just boosts your sensor strength.i still can do 4 lvl missions in it. its efficiency is less, but far from being zero."

3/12/2010,"supported.i understand that some ships are meant to be ""versatile""... but there comes a point where being so is actually a detriment. the typhoon, as pointed out, is a great ship due to its ""versatility"" and can pump out a lot of dps. however ships, like the lachesis, don't have enough high slots or grid to utilize the split weapon bonuses properly and as a consequence can't perform against other ""pure-bonused"" ships within its class dps-wise.as for the nit-pickiness... well... some of us like a bit of consistency ."
3/12/2010,nit picking or not.... bold faced lies in game tend to ruin the theme.
3/12/2010,"this is a small, easy fix. someone just has to go in and change the text. roden has no business saying they make missile boats (and the bonus on the ships with it is a waste) and every reason to claim they make powerful electronic warfare and logistics ships. so, what they say and do are basically opposite.even if the bonuses are not removed (the bonuses would be changed to something else in an ideal world), even if the weapons mounts weren't changed (no need for missile slots in an ideal world), at least change the text in the description."
3/12/2010,"supported - roden ships are just another example of how hilariously badly thought out many of the ""newer"" gallente ships actually are."
3/12/2010,easy fix which makes sense. +1
3/12/2010,seriously allow us to stop our ship when we are stuck on a accel gate.ctrl + space doesnt work
3/12/2010,always worked for me...
3/12/2010,i can cancel warp fine when stuck on them.
3/12/2010,"ok i have now spent a week trying to find keys to the angel/pith 1/10 and 2/10 plexes and i have had no lucknamly its because tey are farmed to hell. apparently these plexes drop b-type loot this is where imo the issue is,people can controal access to thes plexes by farming the first rooms this is because of the extended time between key spawnswhat i would like to see is these plexes braught in line with the serpentis plexes (add a serp 2/10 static plex) and scale the loot acordinglyso:ded 1/10 c-type, faction, frig bpc(v rair)ded 2/10 c/b-type faction, frig bpc v rair)decrease key spawn times to around 1 hour and 2 hour respecfully,add more rats to the 2nd lvl plexesok i know people are going to flaim that im moaning but hay its my right ^^"
3/12/2010,iirc they decreased the drop rate for the b-type loot already. anyway ... try the lowsec plexes. they are usually not farmed as badly. comes with other risks though.
3/12/2010,i love it!secure thimble for sure. nearly useless to anyone who's progressed beyond cruiser mining.

3/12/2010,"well, if i loggon on one day to fin 435 log-on attempts failed showing up, i'd petition it, and they could then do some ip-check magic to ban/something that ip(supporting my own idea as well)"
3/12/2010,"might be.but on the other hand, what would it cost?i seriously doubt that it'd be much work to implement, and it'll hurt no one.if even a single ""hack"" can be prevented, it'd be worth it."
3/12/2010,"guess this is enough other supporters to give myself a thumbs up for this as well. hopefully csm will put this one up, not a lot of responses, but pretty much all of them positive!"
3/12/2010,"if needed i think we can all live even with can without the compression advantage, keeping as much stuff within as the size of the container. often it will be more useful to be capable to better organize the stuff you move than to gain a bit of space. /supported."
3/12/2010,"cmon guys this is eve, we should all kinds of different sizes of cans for our indys and freighters,and if someone could please give me a container that would let you transport a rigged ship that would be amazing, even if for instance the container took up 50km3 but could only hold a ship/fittings/rigs/cargo/drones of a total 25k m3"

3/13/2010,i support.
3/13/2010,well i dont think that eve's code can easily support the integration of having something towed with u thru warp and thru gates so why not juts another t2 variant of freighters? :p
3/13/2010,agreed

3/13/2010,score! thanks zod ;)
3/13/2010,plzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzeventually i would like more drone modules too.
3/13/2010,"only thing i need is an option to restrict drones to locked targets. nothing like being surrounded by frigs scramming me while my light drone keep trying to go kill a bc after being redirected to the frigs for the 10th time.also seeing drone damage in drone bay. if these 2 things were implemented, i'd be content."
3/13/2010,"i like it.and please, for the love of god, let me right-click somebody in my overview/fleet and have my drones guard/assist them. those horrible menus in the drone window..."

3/13/2010,heck at that rate make it a notification.
3/13/2010,"i could partly aggre only on 3rd matter. though as long this... feature will exist, i will use it myself.but 3rd thing is rly kind a bug, as for 1st and 2nd, its a normal game feature.gather more dds to kill your target in 1 minute, and dont let them go (unless they will use 3rd feature/bug) so double logoff/login wouldnt matter at all.you cant just ask to remove every possible feature in the game thet let ppl escape from the grasp of agressors. basicly you ask to make game simplier for you (and your folks may be), and thats wrong.so as i only partly agree about 3rd matter, no my support here."
3/13/2010,"i'm not pro-blob. i don't argue to change log off mechanics just so the big blobs can kill more people.if you are seriously interested in giving people more chances of escape from gate campers and blobbers, we should undo the great nano nerf - when people had more speed and agility they could escape bad situations without resorting to lan cable pulling.the nano nerf was just as retarded as current log off mechanics. the fact that ccp are just fine with this proves they cannot be trusted to make good judgment on game design. we have to force them into doing the right thing, for the good of eve community as a whole rather than select individuals."
3/13/2010,"smaller ships are still fast and agile enough to escape most of gate camps in low.as for heavier. there is still mwd+cloak feature, there is still warpstabs, there is still ecm-bursts. a lot of ways still out there to escape gatecamps in low even without using buggy warp+logoff feature.not even mentioning comlitely safe carrier's logistics."
3/13/2010,"not supported from me either because she's right there is no way to tell if i terminated the process/ unplugged the network cable from an actual unintentional dc. the entire point of terminating a process is for it to immediately cease functioning which means its not going to send any commands back to ccp, it's simply going to drop all contact just like a dc would. now with a ctrl-q yes you could have that send signals because the program would still be running until the ctrl-q command was finished and implementing a message sent to ccp saying ctrl-q command was used to log off would work but the other methods are still useable.care to explain exactly how a fix could be implemented that the server would not need to be informed of how you logged off? cause i've never heard of one before."
3/13/2010,"escaping the gatecamp with closing game client is not a game feature - it's undocumented outgame mechanics, totally unintended by devs.escaping the bubbled pos by double-logoffing is not intended game feature too - at least because devs are already fixed it.the motivation of my statements have no influence on their rightesnousness or usefulness. so please refrain from such demagogy."
3/13/2010,"i had disconnects during warping into camp and i know what i'm talking about.i am solo pvper and had numerous losses due to disconnects. i never screamed at ccp - please tell me what i'm doing wrong.exactly. you can counter each of the 'features' by bringing more ships just to counter exploits. ships to aggro you on the other side during warp-in and separate team which will pursue you after warp-logoff trick, dedicated probers to catch logoff-login-logoff-login jerks, bringing more dps to kill you in 1 minute without aggro. it's not really possible to camp gate with small team without letting guys (who know these tricks) escape.do you really want eve to become more blobbish?oh come on dude. did you read my post on top of this page? care to test any of its points and say 'yes, fixing this point will affect those who had legit disconnect'?"
3/13/2010,and so what? how inability to distinguish between legitimate disconnect and unplugging the cable prevents fixing described bugs? how exactly fixing described bugs affects the players who got legitimate disconnect?can you please answer these questions yourself and not repeat someone other's legends and myths.
3/13/2010,"+1, fix this"
3/13/2010,"1. no. no aggro after you log off without aggro. way too exploitable and unfair to those that wait out aggro timers and log. wouldn't be that big of an issue except for #2.2. was actually fixed a while back you would warp back to original log-off spot no matter how many times you relogged. broken game mechanic.3. you can't point or lock someone in warp. not sure how this works when combined with logging off, heard it was ruled an exploit. can't comment on this one...supported to fix #2 as it was already implemented once and broken in a subsequent patch."
3/13/2010,you instantly become 'invulnerable' after hitting ctrl-q - others can't lock you.
3/13/2010,"and what do you call people who log off literally 1-3 seconds before they get aggro?the current mechanic is much, much more exploitable than the potential exploit you worry about. so even if changing it wouldn't solve all problem, it would make situation at least 10 times better"
3/13/2010,"low-sec has primarily become the buffer zone between big null-sec sov alliances and high sec..most available assets are taken by thee alliancs and or there supporters.its no longer a ""wild place.lets fix that. one idea is to make low sec moons depletable with a fixed amount of resources that can only be regenerated after a certain amount of time of not being used.leave null sec just as it is and of course high sec moons are all baren anyway.to me this is a natural gradation between high low and nul sec."
3/13/2010,you left out the bit about piracy being an issue.
3/13/2010,"the probing system could be a bit more user-friendly. positioning probes in 3 dimensions on a 2-dimensional grid is, at times, very aggravating."
3/13/2010,"for those who dont know, as how it work now, the more ppl grinding one agent, the more lps it will give until hit the cap for particular mission.but thats exatly the reason of overblobing such systems as motsu, irjunen, dodixie, e.t.c. more to say, thats the reason why 90% of lowsec agents completely out of use.you simply cant in solo or small team make ""forgotten"" agents worthwhile. its very often then good quality agent in lowsec pay less then middle quality agent in highsec. no need to add about security and comfort between lowsecs and highsecs.so proposal is, make it work completely reverse. as more ppl grinding solo agent, as less it will pay to them. and so, as fewer ppl will work on other agent, as more it will pay them. logical too, if hundreds of capsuleers grinding one constelation, then probably it is mostly out of any crime, no need for local administration to pay a lot to keep things in line. so otherwise as fewer ppl will work in another constelation as more desperatly agents in that constelation will requere service of capsuleers, and as more they will accept to pay to them.so what does it gives?it will force ppl to split more evenly acros eve, and it will encourage more ppl to explore many empty (as they are now) lowsecs.p.s. thats need to be done for highsecs and lowsec. i dont mind if 0.0 space will keep the old mechanics for it agents."
3/13/2010,"huh?missioners now have to spread out to make isk, like, say - practically any other profession? (except market trading)yes!also give anyone with over 10k lp a ""lollypop"" item in their hangar once this gets implemented."
3/13/2010,"i agree with this topic, as it'll make ninja salvaging more of a nomadic profession. i used to mission in dodixie, so i know how much of a pain they can be.also, it just makes sense. there should be some kind of slider that prevents hubs like dodixie from ever becoming unused, but just to limit the mission runners there."
3/13/2010,"not really, since it is based on missions and not agents. agent himself only add to payout through the relative quality which does add up over time.the more times it is completed the more data points are available for auto-balancer, so in that sense it 'caps out'.but you are ignoring the equalizer which is time-to-complete also acting as a modifier for agent payouts. if a thousand people all blitz a mission then the payout will be well below what it might be if people waited until the last second to complete.since it is the same missions being run from most/all agents of a specific corp/faction and the auto-balancer works on a missions a ploy like yours will have no effect. there will still be more to be made from higher quality agents.counter:re-write the auto-balancer to include the following factors:- number of actively employed pod pilots (ie. accepted missions over time).- size of corporation in question. the larger it is the lower the wages, juts like real life additional things to do:- remove q20 agents from highest sec space (0.7-1). they are the elite recruiters, surely a corp doesn't waste that skill by having them work out of the hq but rather where needed most (ie. where security is lacking).- introduce 'expeditionary' branches of empire corps that only exist in deep-lowsec (0.1-0.3) and have better offers in store, say halfway between militia and regular stores."
3/13/2010,there's no 4/20 military agents in hi-sec.ps does anyone have link to article/discussion thread about how auto-balancer works?
3/13/2010,"they removed the q20 agents? good stuff, haven't really paid attention to specifics since going industrial. scaling q based on system security is still a good idea though long hard slog through chaff .. auto-balancer"
3/13/2010,"linked thread describes payload balancer which balances mission base attributes, not agent's. i've never seen an evidence of per-agent payload balancer, in my past experience proper base attributes are taken (isk/lp reward) and modified by skills/standings/solar system security status. e.g. angel/sansha wc4 in extremely inpopular 0.4 system has never gave me less reward than the same mission in popular 0.5 system.that is, i still don't believe that this:is true.it's important to remember though that in different regions/corps/factions agents offer different set of missions. it's possible to have 2 missions which look absolutely the same, but actually it's 2 missions with different ids and different set of base attributes. one may be taken by some agent in placid, another by agent in aridia.to prove existance of such 'per-agent' mechanism we have to find agents in the same region, where lower ss/higher quality agent (with other things being equal) gives less reward only because it's unpopular."
3/13/2010,"i don't think the op understands how the autobalancer works (then again, no one outside ccp *really* knows, but at least some details have been made public). afaik, the quality of an agent and the payout given is independent of the number of players using that agent; the only relevant factors are the average time taken (across all of eve) for a player to complete the mission in question and the security status of the agent's home system.that said, it would be very nice if an agents' quality was dependent on the number of missions it had given out over the last month or so, with over-farmed agents rapidly dropping to -20 quality and those in far-flung backwaters rising. supported."
3/13/2010,"mission base is all the auto-balancer modifies, this base is then adjusted by agent effective quality (eq).eq is dependent on personal standings with said agent/corp/faction and system security (approx. q10 per 0.1 decrease in sys.sec). each mission has an absolute maximum payout that is determined by security of agent system and hitting that ceiling is very fast in high-sec (~6.5k lp for 0.5 system as i recall goes up rapidly to over 20k in 0.2-0.3).your wc example fits perfectly with this, as the 0.4 agent would have a +q10 and the ceiling raised (all other things being equal).if the goal is to encourage low-sec mission running then perhaps making the eq adjustment more steep is a good first step. allow one to hit the ceiling faster thus making up for the higher risk .. it is the low income initial agent grooming that pulls teeth ps: i ran an agent in a 0.5 system on/off for over a year and eq went all the way to 70-80 or something silly .. ceiling was hit after a couple of weeks though."

3/13/2010,ccp ftw - cant this be solve by the on board computer pridictin a fligt path and warpin the pilot to a planet then to the intended destination? and to prevent campin at plants because pilots will figure out - hmm he has to warp to this stargate which would take him/her through this planet or station so lets camp here- add a option to warp to diffrent points on the planets orbit and have like satealites orbitin that plant that can assest in a pilot warpin quickly for lowsec and high sec. because warpin through stuff to me is a glitch even though ur movein at the speed of light.
3/13/2010,"curved warps fix this up i think. warping through things is one of those little things that drag eve down, imho. it look so goofy... they try to justify this like warping is not really moving it wrap space or such as.also, getting out of the same fixed and specific tiny boxes of space (grid) would be welcome by me!lastly, warp speed is many times over the speed of light. the speed of light being 0.00200398707 au / second, even a slow 0.75 au/s freighter is slushing around at 375 times the speed of light. mach 1 is 340 m/s. just so you know."

3/13/2010,pwnd.hard.
3/13/2010,"i would like to see some sort of damage mitigation feature in eve, where the more people targeting and shooting a ship, the less effective the damage. each ship-class would have a set amount of incoming dps, where it gets 100% damage up to that dps. after that, additional incoming damage becomes more and more ineffective. this would help make active tanking slightly more useful in larger engagements. additionally, in larger fleets it would start to become useful to have ships pick primaries by squads, instead of 100+ all shooting the same target. however, care would have to be taken to pick dps caps for each class that still allow for complex battle situations and don't completely destroy focus fire.ship class- 100% damage until this dps- 50% damage at this dpspossible numbers:frig- 500 - 750cruiser- 2000- 3000bc - 3000 - 4500bs 6000 - 9000cap 30000 - 45000for example, an cap that has 30000 incoming dps will take full damage. however, each additional ship hitting past that 30000 number will not do full damage, but merely a % of damage. at 45000 incoming dps, additional ships are only hitting for 50% of their potential."
3/13/2010,sins of the solar empire.

3/14/2010,"i dont know if i like all the ideas, but i support the need for change in the way lowsec works.. for me i think low sec's problem is it's lack of role in the eve universe.when i first moved to 0.0 it was to do pvp. i wanted to get in a small gang and go roaming to find some other players who were also looking for a fight. what i got was huge blobs that 4 out of 5 times ended up in me hanging in a system without grid for half an hour or so until i could see on my ui that someone were shooting my bs and slowly killing it and my pod all the time still with no grid.. so 0.0 happened to be about blobs and ratting safely for 15mil/h to afford getting killed without grid.as that doesn't seem to change i would like low sec to fill that missing role. low sec should be the place where you could have small scale pvp combat against other pvp-minded players.i didn't want to move to lowsec at that time as what i thought i could do there were either just sitting all night long in a gatecamp or trying to act as an anti-pirate and get just about nothing in reward for those few pirates i would happen to catch. maybe i'm all wrong about what happens in low sec but hey, what i don't see i don't know, so please if someone knows about another way of living there, please enlighten me.one thing that could make me move to low sec instantly and make me want to stay there would be by making anti-piracy/piracy worth doing so that low sec won't be about gatecamps and killing carebears but more about a fight for survival and profit for both pirates and their counterparts.i think for that to be possible there should be more profits related to piracy and anti-piracy. sure pirates got ransoms as a possible income source, but there must be other ways to boost the attractiveness of living as a criminal in new eden. smuggling maybe, i don't know but i think the market (or maybe a new black market) will be a part of the answer as it would open up for new professions and new ways of making isk.i don't think there should be a sov system as we know it from 0.0. if there were to be one it shouldn't be controlled purely by military dominance as i think that will just make the blobs start appearing in low sec too in the way we know them in 0.0. once again i don't claim to have the answers but i definitely think that low sec have some great opportunities in the eve universe for new pirate related professions and for anti-piracy organisations to see a reason for doing their job, which is not in any way to make low sec safe for carebears. instead their function should be to counter the new piracy professions in a way that could be profitable or in some way rewarding for the pirates or antipirates who do their job best.maybe a system where sovereignty were controlled by some kind of piracy lp's could be a way. the lp's could be given to both pirates and anti-pirates in some way when they did something that would have a positive impact on their way of living as a pirate or anti-pirate and the sovereignty of systems or the possible profits of the market (or black market) could then be affected by who had the most sov in the system. if as an example there were two pirate organisations fighting for the sov of a system, the one having the most sov (gained through doing piraterelated stuff(don't know how it should be earned but somehow without forcing huge blobs to camp the systems all day)) could have the best ability to manipulate the illegal part of the market and then if a anti-piracy organisation gained more sov in that system it could limit the pirates ability to use the illegal market and then allowing the anti-pirates to do something else that could work as a income source for them instead.in that way it could be profitable for both pirates and anti-pirates to try to control the lowsec regions but as the sov system wouldn't be that dependent on combat and military control huge blobs wouldn't appear in the way they do in 0.0just some thoughts."

3/14/2010,"support bump, of justice.csm/devs take note, this is what ui polish looks like."
3/14/2010,strongly supported
3/14/2010,"if the reward is crappy...you don't have to do storyline missions at all.but i think this kind of storyline should be implemented for any agent out there, not only for gallente.so storylines become somewhat difficult (faction standing is very precious) and a challenge. people (especially missionrunners) interacting in lowsec is a great milestone in gameplay."
3/14/2010,you have my support. these new storylines were very poorly thought out and implemented.
3/14/2010,"from all the fw threads out there it seems that fw is still rather bugged/exploitable/imbalanced as far as the plexes go. i haven't tried it myself so anything i say is secondhand at best, but it seems rather off to base a major change to a long established game mechanic on the results of an admittedly incomplete and low priority feature. especially when it singles out only one portion of the playerbase performing the same activity.supported for that reason."

3/14/2010,i hate it when ccp tries to provide game balance through obtuse ui so i'm going to have to support this. really now that they have the mechanics they want though i think they should take a look at re-balancing the system. really i'd prefer battlesmiths idea though as it's much more fluid and fits in with whats already there.
3/14/2010,"yes yes oh god yesa good point is made about combat probes, though, in that it would give a big advantage to probers because it would take a lot less time to probe. this new functionality would be solely for reducing how tedious it is to position your probes... not to make it quicker... so how about when you use a saved probe pattern, it takes an additional <number that makes sense> seconds to run a scan?definitely supported."
3/14/2010,"i'd support if the proposal was an improved ui, but the current one is workable, and i find myself falling in with the crowd saying it could make things too easy. something worth getting should take time and have difficulty. wonder how the csm will vote on it..."

3/14/2010,"it is the other way around, cloaks are the counter to probing."

3/14/2010,lol
3/14/2010,"you still didn't answer my question... why won't you use cloak if it's so effective then?proper decloaking is efficient only when target which jumped into camp cannot warp from its spot and has to fly ~10 km just to get out of the bubble. t3 has interdiction nullifier which helps to get out of the bubble anyway because even if you're decloaked, it's too late for campers.ye, what's wrong with force recons?raging is poor argument. go fit a cloak on your pve ship and prove that it's still efficient (and even more efficient than immune to probers setups)!"
3/14/2010,"the same reason a recon wouldn't load up on eccms instead of a cloak, because the wrong tool for the job, no matter how good won't do you any good. if what you need is a hammer and someone brings you the best screwdriver in the world you're still sol. so, how exactly will a t3 fit for plexing do his job cloaked? and why would you not want a t3 to do the job it's meant to do while you seem to not have a problem with a recon doing his job with 100% safety?actually this just isn't true. so arguing with you that it is possible while you argue it isn't is pointless. i'll have to leave it at that.there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. i'm pointing out that they do their job extremely well while being 100% safe. but that's what they're meant to do. wouldn't you agree? but what i'm having trouble understanding is why would you think recons are fine and that they *should* be able to do their jobs in 100% safety while t3s shouldn't. your response a couple of posts above was ""i'm only talking pve here"" which leads me to believe you're ok with invulnerabilities in pvp but not pve.then you change the conversation to ""well, the interdiction nullifier makes it invulnerable"". and then my response to you is that your problem is with the interdiction nullifier and why not ask ccp to nerf that instead? you still haven't proven that the dissolution sequencer is overpowered. and you really won't be able to. because as long as you think 100% safe intel-gathering is ok but 100% safe plexing isn't your argument is hypocritical.go fit eccms on a recon instead of a cloak and prove that it's still efficient (and even more efficient than immune to probers setups)."
3/14/2010,"i am currently doing 0% pvp, even felt like leaving my corp because i can't play long enough to be worthwhile.my true motive is that you can do like those who ganked in hi sec and managed to cheat concord.or those in wow who would go over the roofs to harass newbies since guards were not programmed to attack over roofs. the art of finding the little hole to subvert the game rules. also called exploit.it's easy: do you do the plexes / whatever with the gimped setup or not?if yes, then:- you factored in the gimpage and still found out it's profitable enough to bother- you factored in the gimpage and still can do the task, that is gimp or not it does the job, it's a job *enabler*. without that cheat setup you would *not* be there. and thus you are exploiting the game taking advantages you should not take.and where is it written that a t3 is meant to do its job without any risk?because that's a powerful mechanic that has been introduced to help t3 ships where they would be weak. that is an intended, calculated, planned, intended feature, with no side ""fine math"" or tricks to go beyond the limits.t3 ships were made with that advantage in mind.it's players who decided to add another, so you get two powerful mechanics and one of them is beyond game engine management and thus an exploit."
3/14/2010,"nano ships and falcons affected whole pvp aspect of the game, unprobeable ships affect only lazy carebear gankers.then you can catch his alt and he wont be able to do anything, only sit in space /same with cloaky ships/.you still have to return mission and refit or get ammo /and if you use alt for it it can be ganked/.you can camp station all day if you have time, even near downtime. so you are saying it should be completely impossible to do plexes or missions if there are enemy ships in system?so being 'lol completely immune' why having a role in pvp is ok /cloaked ship scouting enemy/, but in pve /missionin ship/ its not...its still possible and if you are decloaked or you cant cloak because something is near you you are instalocked and dead /tbh not that hard with competent gatecamp because every new bubble popped will interrupt initiated warp/. hard to believe it - as missionrunner you are whining for l4 mission nerf and as carebear you are whining for nerf of unprobeable ships that dont affect you in any way.you can probe down plexes even if you cant probe down ship. but i understand its hard for lazy ganker. lies, many ppl ran 0.0 mission even without unprobable ships and its not cheat setup. its same like saying that cloaks are cheating.you are lying, its not exploit and cheating.they are not doing anything without risk.no, its working as intended and its not an exploit."
3/14/2010,"it's impossible to have this discussion with you and we'll get nowhere fast. no need to even address your points. however, the above gem is probably the most laughable of all. if you think t3 pilots are exploiting game mechanics then feel free to petition them as exploiting game mechanics is against the eula.as was already said, this is about lazy gankers wanting their easy pve kills. all i can say is good luck with your nerf crusade. that is all."
3/14/2010,its not only about ganking carebears. there are other purposes for unscannable ships. i mentioned t3 fleet booster ships before.before t3-ships a commandship was vulnerable while running gang links because you can't use the links while being in warp or cloaked. why did ccp do this? because otherwise any commandship could warp permanently between several bookmarks and be invulnerable.now with t3s ability to use ganglinks and being unscannable this mechanic is obsolete and you can exploit the game mechanic of warfare links by being unscannable. either get rid of unscannable ships or make ganglinks be used in warp!fleet commands were nerfed pretty hard with the introduction of t3 even without that scan mechanic.

3/14/2010,"supporting my own topic, obviously"
3/14/2010,only being able to put 6000 dps on a bs before having some sort of penalty would destroy warfare? really?
3/14/2010,"this has to be one of the stupidest proposals i've ever read. if you think active tanking isn't useful, then don't use it, or perhaps propose a buff if you think it's underpowered (it's not). don't go trying to completely ruin perfectly-sane game mechanics in which if 100 people are dealing a collective 10,000 dps to a ship, that ship takes 10,000 dps. to change that would be to require a complete revamp of every single combat-related module and bonus in the entire game and then everything would look different on paper, but it would still end up working just the way it does now. you know why? because right now the game is balanced.if you don't like how much damage you take when you're primaried by a 100-man enemy fleet... don't go places where you might encounter a 100-man enemy fleet. it's really quite simple."
3/14/2010,"i would not like to see any sort rr bonus on the ships in questions. take the hyperion for instance. what would you do be doing in a rr gang with a 8-turret ship? drop one gun for a rr? you're not going to be accepted in a rr bs gang without a rr module. hence, bring the megathron.if you're talking about dedicated logistics support, well, that could work, but it's already been stated that active tanking ships work best in very small and/or solo engagements. you're not going to have dedicated logistics around for those.why make this more convoluted than it needs to be? the original idea presented is simple, easy, and makes sense (and still has my support)."
3/14/2010,"there is a disparity between the usefulness between the armour/shield resist bonus and the armour repair bonus in that the resist bonus works well with a buffer tank, an active tank and spider tanking. the active tank bonus is also useless when the ship is used in larger than very small scale pvp whereas the resist bonus is useful as either a buffer or a remote rep. dropping a turret for a remote rep is not that big of a deal when it comes to it, in fact, in some instances we use dual rr fits on our megs's in my corp when in fleet bs fights. 9% per level to armour repair amount and remote repair recieved looks like it would work very well amongst the 3rd tier bs's (haven't checked the bc's yet) with some other tweaking of these ships stats all the 3rd teir bs's would bcome very useful, well rounded ships that can be used in small/large fleet engagements or solo."
3/14/2010,lets change kinetic only bonus to regular dmg bonus on caldari missile ships.
3/14/2010,"i'm confused naiomi. why have you asked for that in here? i also disagree, caldari are the kinetic race. but we're going way off topic now"
3/14/2010,"it is easy ,same argument as your post ,kinetic bonus is weaker than the regular dmg bonus,it limits those ships where kinetic is heavily resisted same way as active bonus does within fleets see similar :d"

3/15/2010,"as a specific question, would people be happy if rails received a 20% reduction in pg and a 10% reduction in cpu needs with all other stats remaining the same?would that be enough to balance them with other ships/options?"
3/15/2010,"multi-part answer. maybe and no.people have found ways to fit the guns. the biggest problem is they barely scratch the paint on other ships. lowest alpha, lowest dps, throw bad tracking in the mix and they simply don't fill a niche in combat.it is most notable with bs, where most battleships are capable of engaging at nearly the same range (or better range) as railgun ships. smaller ships have at least the benefit of longer range. the smaller ships (hac, bc, cs, af, inty, frigate) would find benefit in easier fitting, but bss simply need to have damage that is relatively in line with all the other sniper ships.again, i will point to these two graphs:dps as a function of rangealpha strike as a function of rangeif you are against the idea of the need to boost damage for large railguns and disagree with the numbers in those graphs, i challenge you to put together better railgun fits than those used to make the graphs.small and medium railguns have a range benefit. if they had lower fitting requirements, they could have a healthier tank so they had the possibility to gain range before being pulled apart. small additional problem with that is half the railgun ships are caldari, which means they are also the slowest ships (likely to be unable to increase or even maintain range from their target). the easiest fix would be to give all railguns some kind of ""gotcha"" damage (such as higher alpha, slower rof) placing them between lasers and artillery. the alpha graph shows enough gap between the two where this wouldn't be unreasonable, and it carries through for medium and small guns."
3/15/2010,"sadly not, it would fail to address their poor tracking, fixed damage type, low dps and alpha etc. enabling us to fit more of a bad gun seems to be a poor substitute for fixing their behavior."
3/15/2010,"but would it open up other advantages the other ranged ships would not have? ie more low slots and rig slots because no rcu's would be needed. more rigging options. more ean's and tracking computers, which are traditionally very high cpu and not viable. etc. and if so, would this then give the ship an advantage no other ship has that is also viable in pvp?"
3/15/2010,as i said:because battleships have enough grid and cpu to play around with to make them fit. a freed up slot on a bs isn't going to allow the tank to be beefed up to compensate for the lack of firepower. easier fitting for smaller ships would allow them to increase their speed (or beef up their tank) so they could get to a range where they are safe from counter-fire.
3/15/2010,"not really - while there's other dumb issues (web bonus, lol) that make it a cruddy choice in general, look at the kronos vs. the other marauders. and maybe compare it with the tier 2 and 3 bs of each faction too.it only needs to fit 4 guns, thus opening up the cap/pg you describe and still suffers sub-par performance because it simply can't push out the kind of damage that the other ships in its class do- nevermind against therm tanking factions such as angels.unless you arm it with blasters, which for missioning where most rats orbit at about 40-60k is utterly idiotic.on the pvp side of things, you will still run up against resistances and buffer tanking issues and you will still be saddled with the fact your guns don't hit well enough, far enough, or hard enough to compete at range.off the top of my head, adding a 3rd fixed damage type might be a good way to go. that means that while the damage of hybrids is still fixed, they do have the advantage of a wider spectrum of damage making them harder to buffer tank against. perhaps a 60/25/15 mix of therm/kin/em or something. i'd like to see a reasonable 7.5%-10% damage boost across the board along with some fixes to the awful state of t2 hybrid ammunition.generally speaking, leave the long range alpha to artillery, leave the short-medium range chewing up to lasers, and give railguns a niche in between them doing medium-long ranged, wide-spectrum damage.p.s - blasters need work too :)someone in my corp made the argument that drones ought to plug that dps hole, but my personal feeling is that relying on synergy between three different weapons systems to make up for the shortcomings of the others probably means we have three broken ways of delivering damage."
3/15/2010,"my issue is with the idea that increasing damage fixes everything. they've done this countless times in the past, and all it does is move the flaw to the next race in line.currently, mh hyperion fits get 401 dps at silly long ranges. they have approximately the same dps, capacitor, and other statistics to similar racial bs types/fits. the mega has a bit more fitting issue, but 2 useful bonuses. the domi has always been heavily limited by fittings, but does well anyways because of drones. increasing the damage of all of the rail guns is just going to push the hyperion over the top and make it the new best sniper bs.i would argue that blasters need a hard look at and a lot of radical changes of some sort, opinions vary. but rails seem to do pretty well, and if fittings were eased, i could see a small boost that wouldn't be to damage for once that might just do enough to put them in line with other races rather than make them the new fotw. maybe, possibly, look at capacitor as a secondary change if the fittings aren't enough.as for the tracking issue, it is very apparent people have no clue how tracking works in this game to be arguing over such small numbers. the difference between the long range guns is hardly noticable, and does not drastically affect their performance. the only balance change you could possibly make on the tracking front to create balance would have to be huge to be noticeable. and then the argument becomes where is balance between long and short range weapons. actually, if you added a 3rd or 4th mag stab, it would give you that small damage increase most people here are begging for, without having to change the gun mechanics themselves. i believe the 3rd adds 14ish % and the 4th adds around 7% dps.but yes, you could also go with more tank, or more agility, or other things that might serve a purpose in certain fleets."
3/15/2010,"please link this fitting.the mega is the worst sniper. a domi sniper is just a joke.unlikely.a 3rd mag stab is already standard on a rokh, and it still does very poor sniper damage compared to the 2 damage mod fits of all the other ships. a 4th is a stacking penalty joke.an extra slot would also not fix the short range and low damage of the mega."
3/15/2010,"except that drones cannot engage at sniper range, so their damage has no bearing.making generalizations for different guns is the basis of the logical error leading to the argument against boosting damage for rails. if not for the bonuses from different ships creating overlap, there are modules and rigs that do this even more (except for damage - due to heavy stacking penalties). but if we are going to generalize the different guns, this is not balanced: dps=laser>projectile>railalpha=projectile>laser>railrange=rail>laser>projectileit would make more sense for hybrids to be a hybrid of projectiles and energy weapons - not only in name and technology but also in dps and alpha."

3/15/2010,"just to note, even at 32x antialiasing the shadows look jagged.-t'amber"
3/15/2010,"because in some older games, in order to save resources, shadows and transparent surfaces aren't antialiased. it's not that you can't antialise them, it's that in some cases you choose not to for performance reasons."
3/15/2010,"/signed i'm all for this entering the pc market as well. i don't mind seeing it on consoles..but i, like many other players it seems, will not go out of my way to buy a console purely for dust. especially if it is a fps, as those just are utter rubbish on consoles - i've tried many and hated all. pc is the only true fps platform. others may disagree, but the console version is already certain for you.. i want this game to be made available for pc,too. i have seen plenty of solid arguments that support a move to the pc, but none that really stand out why this should be console only. surely, ccp can not ignore their player base like that?"
3/15/2010,"for the review of my peers, the csm, and ccp, i would like to request the following revision of blueprints and how they are implemented within eve.issue:-transporting\storing blueprints is cumbersome and extremely high risk-dealing with dozens or hundreds of blueprints is aggravatingin it's current iteration, blueprints are treated like a physical commodity, a cd/book/scroll. they are moved physically and vulnerable to theft, and organizing them is frustrating once they are in excess of 20-30. each blueprint goes from being a stackable item, to a unique item once researched, i'm sure this is unfriendly to the item databases. likewise with the constant removal and restoration of these blueprints when they enter or leave an installation.idea:-move blueprints from physical space to remotely accessible databases in virtual spaceimmersion wise, treat blueprints as a license to use copyrighted designs, which is more or less permanent for the person or organization.the exact implementation of this i am not emotionally invested in, but the general idea would be to treat the blueprints more like a skill book and less like an interactive item. player x travels to station y, purchases a blueprint, and installs it to a virtual space that is effectively omnipresent. any costs involved and the delivery requirements for this process i leave to game designers, but i would assume that a player who only needs to manage his 8 ammo blueprints would pay less, or nothing, and a player or corporation storing 100+ would pay a more significant amount to maintain it.i would imagine that the blueprints would then be organized in the blueprint tab of the industry window in a similar fashion to the way they are organized in the market tab, by type and not by their current location. a blueprint being researched would be locked from manufacture, and vice-versa.continuing in that thought train, a player may have access to his own database, and his corporation may also maintain it's database that may or may not be accessible by the player as well. adding blueprints to the corp database and/or accessing those blueprints for manufacture/research would make sense using corp roles/permissions.impact:-firstly, that the system become simple enough that a normal player might consider purchasing simple blueprints for items they use frequently (ammo, drones) because it is convenient and easy-secondly, give a mechanism for taking high sec industry into low sec hubs, an intermediary step to providing a 'tortuga bay' style jita in low sec.i now ask for and welcome the thoughts, insights and criticisms of my fellow players."
3/15/2010,theft is good for eve.you got roles to protect them.
3/15/2010,"i am inclined to agree with you, but support my proposal. the objective being to mobilize and organize industry, and not to circumvent theft. do you have a suggestion that will include opportunities for theft into this proposal."
3/15/2010,supporting this.
3/15/2010,agree
3/15/2010,ccp please fix mining to make it worthwhile
3/15/2010,"thats no exploits afaik, but bad mechanic and only thouse who logoff on purpuse get benefits from it - since if you really have problems with connection - good chances are that eve-server would go on like you still in game, or close client after you engaged in combat.the way i see it fixed - after character gets logged off (no matter for real or ctrl-q) for 10 seconds ship stoppes any warp/moving related activites (or waits for warp to end (if speed > 0.1 au per second) and then kickes 10 second timer on) and can be agressed - after that - the usual: emerg. warp and 1 or 15 minute timer depending on agr. state."
3/15/2010,to often and easily abused to be left in tbfh.
3/15/2010,this would not work against those ctrl-qing right after warp in and would also require a change to pve scrambling mechanics and would make warp-in-aggro missions easily exploited / defeated.
3/15/2010,"i do not sign it, jeremey why the hell did you tell everyone about these exploits? why? you think it`ll help? and i say: no it wont help. before this thread only a rare golem or whatever would use these things to get out of the camp, but now you`ve opened so many people`s eyes on it, that everyone, every single one uses this crap now. have you lost your mind man? or its juat a rage cuz you sometimes fail to kill some sweetass carebear ship/freighter? well im glad to tell you that now you will have difficulties to kill a lot more people, as these things have become extremely popular, you may be proud of yourself, gj./not signedimho this thread should not exist, devs plz delete it as it tells everyone about the exploits. before only about 200 people were useing them in the whole eve, now every single bud uses em, omgwtfbbq... yeah, big thx jeremey, big thx man. good job ffsgrammar mistakesi was fine about these exploits although i never used them myself, and i was fine when sometimes my victims use them, because it were only rare occasions.oh and btw some people have really bad internet, so wtf if they have a disconnect in camp/warp they lose their ship? yeah sounds good for you? but perhaps not for them. i personally do not want to write reimbursemnt petitions every time i lose my hsip because of a power cut, etc and then wait few days just to enjoy a gms refuse to reimburse my ship because the server was not lagging, it is me who is lagging.this thing is nto exploit, it was created to help laggers, to defend them from some ass pirate-kiddies who want to kill him when he lags. and now these pirate blob-kiddies are whining on forums ""we cant be silent anymooooooooar!!! we want easy fraaaags!!! it is such a pleasure to kill a faction fitted golem or whatevah when he laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaags!!!! whyyyyyy we cant killl heeeeeeeeeeeeem?!?!?!?!?!??!"" how bou you guys grow up a bit eh?"
3/15/2010,"and fixing this will deny forever making deep spots :(( that would be really, really sad... devs do not listen to him. he posted this crap on russian community forums (eve-ru.com) as well, and you now what? few people support him. only few. because if he do not have enough dps to kill a logoffsky, its his problem, not mine, not ours, and not ccps.period."
3/15/2010,"evidently you have little experience in mission and how the payout change over time. not a surprise, new missions are rare and in recent years only a few people has seen the payout change. generally it go this way: when a new missions is deployed the payout and time is at the minimum level. after it has been completed successfully enough times (failed/refused missions aren't considered) the payout and time for the bonus start to change, going up (but rarely even going near the maximum payout).when enough people has done the mission at least a few times or it appear in some third party forum with the suggestions on how to do it, the payout and bonus time start to decrease, going generally to a very low level. going in lower sec systems increase the floor (minimum pay) and the ceiling (maximum pay) so in low sec you have a higher payout as the floor is higher and the agent quality get increased by being in a lower sec system.-----not supported as the op don't know what he is speaking of. agent eq is not influenced by the number of characters using it."
3/15/2010,"apart from different wording you just said the exact same thing that i did, so not quite sure what the hell that patronising crap is for."
3/15/2010,"re-reading your post i see i did read part of it wrong, so my apologies. i had read it as ""new missions get to the maximum payout fast"", something that rarely happen.your main argument instead was a suggestion to modify the mechanics a bit so that ""the reward from new agents in low sec get to the highest value possible with that agent faster"".so again, my apologies for the wrong interpretation and the patronizing tone."
3/15/2010,"don't know how much flaming i'll get for this one, but it should be fun...i want to encourage more new players to stay with eve after they start playing - that said, i have noticed that the easiest way for new players to play and learn how to play is to jetcan mine. it allows the new player to build some isk, buy skill books, and learn about the game/people/ships/fittings at a reasonable pace. i have done it, and i know most of you at one time has as well. the issue here lately is the imbalance between new players and the veterans who are bored to tears and want to mess with the carebear easy targets trying to build some isk. the aggressor flies up in a tech 2 frigate and swaps all the ore form your can to their can. you just lost a bunch of ore... if you try to take it back, you get tackled and blasted to bits - you just got canflipped, and a ""welcome to eve.""here is my observation it is not possible to deploy/anchor a secure container in >0.8 space, which means that concord will not help you if it's pulled off by someone who wants to mess with you. concord does not view theft as aggression. i know the obvious replies... join a better corp/alliance/fleet/merc friends, etc... that's not always possible when you are just getting your feet wet into the game. proposal:allow players to pay concord to prevent theft from jetcans by adding a huge red warning to the standard warning that the property is protected by contract with concord in 0.8 space or better. if the veteran player wished to continue to take from the jetcan, it will be viewed as aggression and provoke a concord response.the contract is limited to the system that it is made by contacting one of the captains flying around the stargates. the contract has a limited duration based on cost, which can be secured by individuals or corporations (that have an office in that system). contracts cannot be made by players who have 180 or more days played (or set sp cutoff). yes, it's good to have some cover in 0.8 to 1.0 space while preparing for <0.8 space. no, i do not agree that all players have the resources to counter this imbalance between new players and the veterans. we all are very aware of the learning curve in eve, which is a good thing. however, the imbalance created by the veteran players cannot be changed, and the limited recourse available to the new player includes finding another game to play. i do not want that to be the norm given the vast potential for people looking for that extra challenge in a mmo - meaning eve, not the tool who likes to canflip. i think small adjustments are in order to help encourage the player base to grow. just my 0.2 isk worthps - yes this is an alt because i do not need a wardec or kos from that tool who loves to canflip for s&g."
3/15/2010,"wonder if it will encourage suicide ganking of carebears in highsec for ""s&g""?forget the ore, just kill you!ccp should allow flags to be transferred to merc contractors. then you will have a solution that keeps concord out of the way. maybe..."
3/15/2010,"not needed. have your mercs in the corp. if someone steals from you, they are flagged to your corp. so the mercs in your corp can just kill them happily.problem solved."
3/15/2010,"i should have taken bets on how fast the obvious would have been stated.i'm sure it has been a while since many of you were new to the game. hindsight is 20/20 from where you see the situation. your point is valid, but it is not something a new player typically has available."
3/15/2010,true. the new player doesnt have this. but this kind of benefits you get when joining a player corp.ccp should not add some protection you can hire in while being in npc corps.
3/15/2010,"if can flipping occurs in starter systems, you can petition against it as it is against the rules."
3/15/2010,what exactly qualifies as a starter system?
3/15/2010,"you play safe here, because you know ccp are tolerating this side effect of an oudated system (the scanning vs sensor strength mechanics) because they could not ""sell"" t3 ships otherwise.also, exploiting does not equate to violate the eula. it only becomes a bannable offense after the eula gets changed to forbid that precise exploit, it's why everyone do them impunely before they are fixed.also, your resistance to pvp in a pvp game is peculiar. did you lose too many autopiloted badgers in low sec in your early days?"
3/15/2010,"well, i've read the replies, thought it over, and realized that i am indeed, horribly wrong.i have spent the last week inflicting corporeal penance upon myself and of course, wracking my brain for another solution. you folks have made some good points, and i realize that macro mining probably props up a larger portion of this game than ccp would care to admit, but that does mean that it should interfere with honest miners trying to compete in the same market. anyways, here's a relatively pain-free solution.first off, we can assume (as a natural extension to eve lore), that the four empires who possess the never-ending swaths of veldspar would have it in their best interest to regulate the commercial harvesting of said resources.my idea is now a simple one. the use of an exhumer in empire belts would require a mining license. said licenses are purchasable only by player corporations, and by extension grant license rights to all members. the costs of these licenses would be minimal, and serve mostly to keep high-end hulks from operating in the new player corporations.want the max yield per/hour? then you will have to open yourself up to war declarations and so on. anyone not ready or unwilling to face those risks can mine roids in a covetor in much safer conditions in the npc corp. this goes hand in hand with the risk vs reward philosophy, and any industry corp worth their rock-salt will be able to handle a few war-decs now and again.this doesn't punish new players, who can carry on mining in their cruisers and barges, but will hold the macro'ers and similar ultra-carebears accountable should they seek to continue their maximized profits. if not, they can macro to their hearts content -- at a handicapped rate of course. ;)lowsec and nullsec mining would remain unchanged.thoughts?"
3/15/2010,"against anything, hands down, no discussion, against anything which forces players into player corps.zirse, there are like 10 other subjects way more important then this one, you should put your efforts into one of them.move along,red"
3/15/2010,"there is no 'forcing' anyone to do anything here. there would be an 'incentive' to join player corps, but it would be very feasible to mine in an npc corp.under the current system, it actually rewards miners working from under the protection of npc corps, often for all the wrong reasons. this is easily changed and the proposal doesn't inconvenience a large group. for the true anti-socials, its not too far out of reach to form your own private corp.and i will continue to attract attention to issues that are important to me, and what i perceive to be for the greater good of eve. as a miner, this issue is paramount to me."
3/15/2010,"so. t1 hulls look boring. they all have exactly the same pain job. as it stands now, there are very few different paint jobs for each ship, and most of those paint jobs require additional skills to use. this is not a proposal to allow players to customize their ship paint jobs, that would kill the servers rather quickly.this is a proposal to make existing models available for purchase and production by players. evidence - in the dev blog about the upcoming change to the scorpion model, there was a pic which had rows of scorpions with various paint jobs. there were 4 that are currently purchasable in the game, but clearly there are many more models than are currently usable by players. i, for one, would enjoy being able to fly more than just the rattler, widow, navy issue, and civilian scorpion. ccp has them in game, so why not let us use them? perhaps give the models different bonuses, or different statistics and make them buildable, or, just leave them the same and when a person purchases a scorpion they can go to the respective group and get it painted those colors. or perhaps the paint jobs are dependent on whose station the ships were built at. it would offer incentive to build ships in places that aren't jita, and it could be an isk sink. it might even act as a mineral sink. i would enjoy a bit more diversity in the models of ships that people would fly. seeing 100 ravens all in the same color scheme gets boring after a while.anyways, i'd like to say that i stole this idea wholesale from akita t. don't credit me, credit akita."
3/15/2010,"they had it originally in sisi, it was deemed too powerful. this of course was long before some of the missile changes, speed changes, and blah blah other crap happened. i agree, it should be a missile boat.all the destroyer t1/t2 need a look at."
3/15/2010,"the current insurance system linking insurance and mineral prices so that the sum of prices for all minerals doesn't go lower than the insurance payout. that is an issue because it's against the free marked. the proposal is, if someone buys a ship, he gets an offer for insurance that is linked to the mineral prices too. for example he gets 90% of the reprosessing value. the base should be a 7 day weighted avg of the minerals."
3/15/2010,so you want a direct subsidy to manufacturers only?
3/15/2010,otherwise it would be exploitable...i think this isn't really a good option for getting rid of this problem.
3/15/2010,"ok, modify the proposal so that the insurance payout is xx % of the value of the minerals of a reprocessed ship."
3/15/2010,that's pretty much what they're doing on sisi at the moment.
3/15/2010,...and only produces a downward spiral to mineral prices and doesn't solve the ops problem.
3/15/2010,"really? is the insurance payout on sisi linked to markedprices? if yes, then my problem is solved. if not and only the insurance payout is lowered then we have the same mechanics as before."
3/15/2010,"ccp quite often give people what they asked for, rather than what they wanted."
3/15/2010,"if i remember correctly, this was demo'ed at last years fanfest...aka: its already being worked on."

3/15/2010,"i wholeheartedly give a zillion thumbs up to this. it turns highsec into - scan bs missioning, invade with gank ship, gank, gtfo. i don't even have to work for aggro! this would be so sweet!"
3/15/2010,i wholeheartedly give many thumbs up to this suggestion (all two of them!). now i'll finally be able to make my dream come true salvaging in a gank phoon :)
3/15/2010,"let me put this in a way youll understand. your proposing:your hunting a deer, some other guy comes in, and shoots you, takes your gun, still takes the deer, and then leaves; and then the police say to bad, you where hunting in that remote forest we dont like to go too.not supported"
3/15/2010,"to all you comparing deer hunting to salvaging ,or anything out of the real world except salvaging, i think you should read this article and see for yourself that the rules for salvaging are very close to those irl.i could elaborate on why i exactly oppose this proposal but i'm not stating my opinion about why the salvaging mechanic in-game makes actual sense, once again."
3/15/2010,"true, but in the case of marine salvage there isn't a large army of well-armed, sub-millisecond response and invulnerable police ready to blow you out of the water if you make an attempt to defend 'your' salvage.personally it's more fun to pop the wrecks when you get close and tag team it over the whole mission - it's especially fun making you fly 80+km to the next wreck before popping it i don't really see how salvagers can make that much income doing what they do... but hey if you're playing specifically to troll people that's fine too."
3/15/2010,"if a ship irl were to attack another ship that was ""stealing their salvage"", their flag state would likely revoke their registration, making them fair game for navies and other ships. response time would be slower, but the end result would be the same (ship loss)."
3/15/2010,"hiyas.been playing around with the ship scanner lately, handy little gadget to check out other people's fits.one thing i thought that might be useful for people that use it, would be the ability to save to fittings, much the same as when someone links their fit to a chat window.would also have benefits for war scouts to link the enemy fittings to intel channels and such."
3/15/2010,that makes it too easy. work for your intel.
3/15/2010,"with targeting level 3, you can lock 5 targets. who really needs any more than that?"
3/15/2010,"you have apparently never flown a logistics ship, wtb more than 10 locked targets."

3/15/2010,this is madness..
3/15/2010,this. is. eve.
3/15/2010,epic fail noob.
3/15/2010,yeah... i guess that's why there is a skill called multitasking which would technically allow you to lock 5 targets more on top of the 5 you get from targeting and the 2 you get standard.also what's up with the certificate whoring? i just don't get it...
3/15/2010,locking your target + 5 of his drones comes in handy. targeting is a very useful skill for every player and has to be kept in core certificates.not supported.
3/15/2010,"i fail to see how swearing is childish. there have been many people in this thread that just use the pat response, ""well if you can't use anything but swears to articulate your point, then go back to school/stfu"" :).i personally use profanity like if i keep doing so i'm going to win something, and you know what, i'm a college graduate! here's the rub though, it's all about the context in which the words are used. a gm in this post even stated that they don't just ban people or flag them for using moderate profanity. sexually explicit harassment is another issue entirely.i believe in freedom of speech, but where is the line drawn? additionally, this is not an argument about free speech. last i checked, eve was solely under the jurisdiction of ccp. they want eve to have a teen rating and who could blame them? why would you want to?bottom line is, i use profanity frivolously and in so doing fall well short of the harassment line, but i gladly accept that the freedom is limited so that all of us don't have to endure some moron sending up a wall of nonsensical profanity, just because he can.again though, in no way does using profanity make one more childish than someone who chooses not to. they are just words. and i know someone is going to reply, ""well then just use other words"". i just don't want to. i like them. i like the way they sound. i like what they stand for. and i love the visceral meanness of them.as for ccp's prerogative to outlaw naughty speech, get over it. it is not changing, and if it did, even the staunchest advocates of free speech and swearing would be blown away by what would follow."
3/15/2010,"i'd also like to add to this thread that petitions involving swearing, or harrassment, are dealt with on a case-by-case basis by various different people in the gm department. there is bound to be some discrepancy between the rulings since we have to use our own judgement in such cases, whether a gag or warning is warranted or not. if someone has an issue with a ruling, they should petition it and a senior gm or lead gm will review the case. we also tend not to spend a huge amount of time investigating such cases, as we get quite a few of them in our harrassment queue and it's more important to keep the queue down and tend to more important issues than play sherlock holmes in such cases.in essence though using profanity ingame is frowned upon, and any use of profanity could potentially get you a gag or warning. if we officially gave everyone a ""quota"" on how much profanity they are allowed to use, the ingame chat would quickly become littered with profanities and abusive language which would be seriously offputting to many of our customers. public chat, especially official channels such as rookie help, recruitment channel etc, have stricter rules in this regard.also if you suspect a player petitioned you not because he/she was truly offended by your language, but rather just to get you in trouble, then please petition it as doing that is not allowed. we will punish players who try to manipulate us to get revenge on other players, providing we have enough evidence to take action."
3/15/2010,"honestly, it is usually the guy who gets ganked, then threatens to hunt you down irl, slash your tires, toilet paper your dog, and beat you up with a rubber chicken (or some variation) that gets gagged/banned. the tantrums people throw on eve then are shocked when they get banned are pretty epic."
3/15/2010,"this is simply an example of griefing taken to an extreme. player a is simply trying to maximize screwing over player b. it's expanding on an atmosphere eve already encourages. you see it a lot on internet forums too. some posters will act like complete douches, but then run to the report button as soon as someone takes them to task for it. the difference of course is that eve is designed to emphasize its unfriendly aspects.it's more of a teen thing. teens, especially young teens, swear because it's edgey and ""bad"" and they think it makes them look cool. this is exacerbated by the fact that the internet allows people to dissociate with their actions, and not have to hold themselves responsible for the consequences. this is also what encourages the young punks on xbl to behave the way they do.when you hit early-mid 20s, you usually learn that swearing isn't nearly as cool as you thought, and it simply becomes a tool of emphasis or frustration.as for the issue at hand, simply put, the rules are the rules, and everyone here has explicitly agreed to follow them. if you snap off inappropriately at someone because they did something the game specifically allows them to do, then it's your own fault."
3/15/2010,that would be cool if you can join a pirate faction militia.
3/15/2010,"while this would be a neat idea, i believe that a whole low sec/pirate expansion should be on the menu at some point."
3/15/2010,is this some kind of a joke? you do realize your playing eve right?
3/15/2010,king dave said is this some kind of a joke? you do realize your playing eve right?is your post some sort of joke? do you not understand the problem?
3/15/2010,"i duno pottsey but eve is a pvp game per s<U+FFFD>, and ccp wants it that way.(wow, i made a rhyme)"
3/15/2010,didnt ccps reports say something like 75% of people live in empire and on average less than 1 ship is lost per month per account in pvp combat. this suggest combat pvp is the minority. for a pvp game we dont seem to do that much pvp on the whole as a player base. or i am reading/remembering the data wrong.
3/15/2010,"i think you fail to understand what a pvp game is. if eve was a pvp game, there would not be a pve option. pvp games don't need a pve option. ""enemy territory: quake wars"" is a pvp game. there is nothing to shoot apart from other players. eve is a sandbox game. a sandbox will naturally encourage players to pvp (limited amount of sand to play with), but there shouldn't be a need to force it on players, as this removes options and makes it less sandboxy.sandboxes are about options, not about linear paths. if i wanted to play a pvp game, it wouldn't be eve. and i do play pvp games. i don't pvp in eve because the game mechanics does not cater to my personal likes/dislikes. it's simply put: not my cup of tea. i don't really enjoy having a massive advantage over my enemy, as this makes the game less challanging. i always join the loosing team in fps games, as this makes things more of a challange.in eve, this simply means i'll be on the loosing side, and there's very little i can do as a single player to change that. i'm not complaining about that however, as there are plenty of other things to do in eve. but don't try to tell me that i have to pvp, because then the only reason i play eve is taken away from me, and i'll simply find another non pvp game to play.tl;dr: i'm not forcing you to mine/mission/plex/whatever it is that you don't like to do in eve, so don't force me to do something i don't enjoy, because i won't.edit: i almost forgot to mention, pew pew is not the only way to pvp in eve. almost every activity in eve is subject to pvp. in fact, even mission running is subject to non-pew pew pvp in many ways."
3/15/2010,"i'm not claiming that pvp is the only way to play in eve, far from it, but the economy is driven by pvp losses and your minerals, lp and loot wouldn't be worth squat without us to blow it to high heaven."
3/16/2010,"and as screen resolutions increase, so will the difficulty to distinguish the characters."

3/16/2010,"haha!! i had to laugh when i saw this post. i was like ""eve font"" - that sounds bland.but i was thinking - why are so many people reading and supporting this idea.then i open the post and again was surprised to see the idea post so simple and as i read it i laughed. talk about nailing it on the head. i nominate this thread for the all time simplest yet profound use of the english language - a few letters and the man spoke volumes! nice!+1 for sure!"

3/16/2010,i personally don't need them larger. i just need those few letters distinguishable from other letters.
3/16/2010,"may i make a suggestion? instead of just boosting rails, which doesn't really help gallente much, why not boost rail boats like the harpy, moa, ferox, eagle and rokh with a damage and an optimal bonus and boost facemelt blaster boats with a tracking and damage bonus?wouldn't that simplify things somewhat?"
3/16/2010,"i dont think so, the problem is more complex than just changing bonuses.a full revisit of hybrid ships+ weapons is needed.currently there are some problems with these ships:-low dps-cap use-fitting issues(especially for caldari rail ships) and to some extend gallente blaster ships(too small tank)-no real advantage-slow ships (this is mainly problem for the blasters but a huge one imho)-caldari only,very weak at close range even if fitted with blasters,slow+no anti-tackler ability,medicore dps at best--> completly useless at close ranges imho"
3/16/2010,"true, this ship can do 401 dps. but, based on your fit, it can only do that for 4m 55s (with the mwd off). this wouldn't work in a fleet situation. plus, if you allow ships to not be cap stable, then the amarr ships could do significantly more dps than the fits i used for the graphs. such as this:[apocalypse, dps]tracking enhancer iiheat sink iiheat sink iiheat sink iiinternal force field array ico-processor iireactor control unit iiquad lif fueled i booster rocketssensor booster ii, targeting rangesensor booster ii, targeting rangetracking computer iitachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora llarge ionic field projector ilarge ancillary current router ilarge energy collision accelerator i401 dps < 413 dps191km optimal < 200km optimal2110 alpha < 2841 alpha.00356 tracking < .00542 trackingtier 3 gallente battleship price > tier 2 amarr battleship pricethis non-cap-stable apoc would outdo your non-cap-stable hype for all ranges up to 220km (where they both are pushing 315 dps) and beyond (where the apoc's shorter falloff falters). using drugs would only make it worse.before you ask, the abaddon can go even more silly than the apoc (but shorter range). obviously less you can do with the minmatar fits, as projectiles don't burn cap, but their alpha (from the fits i listed previously) is higher than either of these non-cap-stable ships all the way out to the lock limit."
3/16/2010,"people seem to forget that when i did the balancing calculations and came up with the proposal, i did it on the premise of using standard fleet fits (or as close as possible) and using the dps*tank*isk metric.do you know why you don't see hypes in fleets? because that fit with 3x sebos doing 401 dps costs 200mil. the equivalent apoc and tempest fits cost half that.performance/isk is the major issue here, and rails are on the bottom rung as far as that goes.on the comment about fixing the ships instead of the weapons: i think that looking only at the ships is ignoring the issue and beating around the bush. the problem lies in the ammo-weapon interaction. if we want an all encompassing, simple and elegant solution, i think this would have to lie with re-engineering the damage potential of the ammo. after going through all the hybrid discussions, it does seem that most people report that they are underwhelmed by the damage delivered in comparison to the disadvantages of the weapon systems.for example, the idea about delivering extra damage in a third type sounds promising, but it's too complicated. i did like the rails= kin/ blasters=therm weapon damage multiplier rebalancing idea quite a lot. adding the 15% damage boost on top of the respective characteristic damage for rails/blasters would be very nice indeed."

3/16/2010,"if you were to give the caldari ships a damage bonus, you would be taking away a range bonus, thus requiring a little more base range to be added to the stats for railguns. this would fix the issue for the most part, but megathron snipers would no longer have the ""well, at least i'm not flying a rokh"" phrase to comfort them. the smaller gallente ships would be sol, and stuck using s/m blasters which are pretty crap. as i am not fond of the megathron sniper to begin with (it is out of its element anyway) and am in favor of fixing blasters so they actually are functional, i wouldn't lose sleep over it if this suggestion is implemented."
3/16/2010,"that's the dumbest statement i've ever read. you can't count ship cost when insurance totally negates it. the only cost that matters is fittings on anything t1. the markets have driven the cost of building the ships down to exactly what ship + insurance cost would equal payout too.the apoc is hardly more cap stable. also in fleet engagements, it's hardly likely to cap out a bs. anyone with a lot of fleet experience knows that during a fight, due to lag and a lot of other factors, you just don't cap out often. the only time it becomes an issue is when you do pos shooting or some other stationary shoot with a lot of hp to chew through. that's not the intent of a sniper bs. between swapping targets, and periods of warp ins/outs there is plenty of time for the capacitor to easily out recharge the use. not to mention, that hype fit has a spare rig slot that can boost cap.... notice the one empty slot i left.that hype fit is totally practical in any normal super sniper range fleet engagement. that's been the big question throughout this thread, and it got answered. rails are pretty good, all that needs fixing is the fittings issue most gallente have. most amarr and minmatar have far less fitting issues than gallente do, and this is really true of any weapon platform they may use."

3/16/2010,"i have been wondering a while by now why can't we build multiple stations per system. there is nothing mentioned in backstory about it. just arbitary limit placed on number of outposts you can have in system. if it is possible in npc 0.0, low sec and in hi sec why not also in player claimed 0.0. it is the same space afterall. so i propose lifting this ban from eve. allow construction of several outposts per starsystem. i would also like to see ofc ability to build player station in low sec or even in hi sec also ofc, but for now i have to be content with proposing just ability to build multiple stations in starsystems in 0.0."
3/16/2010,posting to support my own topic.
3/16/2010,"i have also allways wondered about this. unless there is a very specific reason or what have you, /supported."
3/16/2010,see no reason not to.
3/16/2010,"with the current sov system being tied to stations and thus a system with multiple stations would be major pain in the ass to take over, not supported.also why would you want to have more stations in the same system?"
3/16/2010,taking over two stations in one system would be considerably easier than taking over two stations in 2 systems.having multiple stations in 1 system is a considerable benefit for industrial activity. consider having your refinery and factory stations close together. there is also the question of office space.allowing multiple outposts per system would be a considerable help in increasing population density in 0.0
3/16/2010,"in my opinion having multiple stations in system would only be relevant if attacker and defender have more or less equal numbers. currently this not seem to be case usually with attacker having clear numerical advantage. so this would just mean currently in everyday situation 1-2 more siege ticks for the 50+ dreads shooting at station while victims of the takeover stay docked or away as they do not have numbers to do anything against attacker. yes - if numbers are equal it would make taking over the system with multiple stations a bit harder. but hey you would get multiple stations for your trouble. if you can under current system of countless rf timers in defenders prime time take a station system then one more station in that system would be irrelevant for the outcome. in fact it would be easier to take over 2 stations in same system than taking over 2 adjacent systems with 1 station in each of them. as far as why ? in my opinion this artificial limit is a bit immersion breaking. i can kinda understand why this system was in place under the old sov system - to avoid someone dropping 4 stations in one (sov 4) system with 5 moons and putting deathstar on each moon in system. even then i tought that this is a bit dumb way of doing it as there was no reasoning whatsover provided why can't you build several stations in the same system in 0.0 while this can be done in empire and npc 0.0 ? ofc i also have agenda, i would prefer to keep factory station and refinery station in same system instead of having to run into adjacent system with my minerals. it's not about 'risk' as there is no risk doing that be that factory system next door or 5j out. jump bridges and several accounts full of scouts plus proper intel channels and there is no danger of moving your minerals in freighter or jf. it is just not convinient. ofc from leadership position one would want to make sure every system has station (bcos of sov warfare reasons) before making multiple stations per system (if that would be possible) - but that is entirely another story. so if you have to pick between conquering 1 system with 2 stations in it or 2 systems with both having 1 station in it what one would you prefer ? i sure would prefer the first one as an attacker - one less ihub to crunch thru."
3/16/2010,"well, you not intent to, but you do circumvent theft...yep, and risk is good for eve. you circumvent that risk too. and no, i don't have ideas how to deal with it, except for them being a ""physical commodity""as for other issues - yes, handling bpo's in manufacturing and researching process is horrible. this is programming and ui issue. why you do not propose fixes to that ? after all, keeping bpo's in your ""servers"" may be plagued with the same problems as well."
3/16/2010,^^ this
3/16/2010,"well, firstly consider the following, blueprints are rarely ever exposed to piracy or theft anyway. there is too much incentive not to when the cost of both currency and research time is so great. for that reason, they are effectively locked down in high sec station where they remain for all time. when they are moved, a reasonable player does so easily in the tiny hold of a covert ship and they are only exposed for a few minutes of travel time when they absolutely need to be moved. or, they are moved by alts in shuttles, etc. the result is not that blueprints are regularly stolen, but that they seldom ever move from a secure location and when they do they are done so in a way that eliminates chance of loss.when i first approached this as a management issue (escape sorting 100+ items to build or research) my first thought was that they would be stored in one item that manages all blueprints. you steal one item, you steal all of them. that wouldn't address the issue of them being locked down, but it would make them easier to deal with for sure. 100+ items compressed down to 5 or 6.that evolved to the item being more like an implant, transported in pod. pods are relatively safe, but that would then marry them to jump clones and the 24 hours timer associated. industry would then become an impediment to usual gameplay? not a bad idea, still, but they wouldn't be vulnerable to theft either, only to permanent loss. you could assuage the damage some and make them more like a skill, where your research is damaged just like you would lose some skills without a proper clone.that then evolved to the idea of making it a permanent virtual space where the chance of loss is replaced with a known constant loss in maintenance fees. the cumbersome moving of items is gone, as is the need to lock them down in one physical space.risking a ship != risking a blueprint, if you lose a ship it can be rebuilt or repurchased funds allowing assuaged by insurance. losing skills is almost impossible. it doesn't make sense that with each blueprint you transport you risk several orders of magnitude more isk and months of research. therefore, i stand by my proposal that they function more like a skill.i do think that the possibility for theft and or destruction is fine. i don't have any specific methods of establishing that, but i would like to see the end result of easily managed blueprints, organized logically like they are in market, instead of physically sorted as items."
3/16/2010,rofl!you might want to stop by in the crime and punishment forum and do some research how often people wipe the blueprint library when the empty corp hangars.also some director of intrepid crossing got popped in his covops full of all kind of capital and subcapital blueprints while trying to dock in a heavily bubbled station.imho blueprints as a physical unit have to stay.(oh and jfyi i have a nice blueprint copy hangar which has around 4000 copies all the time. so trust me i know the pain associated with them.)
3/16/2010,"the first you can attribute to naivete, the second to usual warp to 0 shenanigans. it is possible to secure blueprints, to what extent that is done varies greatly i'm sure. would you rather they were all one physical item then? that would still be an improvement for inventory, and you could then make the change to blueprint sorting within it to a logical sort? alternatively, would you rather that the blueprints could be ejected and taken as individual physical items again for the purpose of resale or theft?as a matter of convenience, it doesn't make a difference to an inside man if he has to steal them all by moving one item, or group moving the entire inventory. it would effect the usability of the entire stock for everyone that had less sinister intentions.where is your complaint exactly?"
3/16/2010,"interesting idea worthy of my support.while i do not like the corp theft (mainly bcos of utterly crappy all or nothing security options from ccp side) it is unfortunately one of the things that can be done in eve and is considered by ccp as one of the allowed activities. so perhaps give us ability to make our bpo library one item. i have over 700 bpo's and it is indeed hassle to mess with them. perhaps it would be better if my library could be condensed into 'magic box' so i would have just 1 item to load when i open the hangar section with prints instead of 700+ items. ofc one would need also some ability to split the box so to say and do all the things you usually do with prints.it would be kinda like putting the prints into container, you just could use them while they are in container. same could be done for bpc's ofc. the 1000 item per hangar and 2000 items in contract (if you are being clever and putting bpc's in cans) are limits i regularly bump into. i do not like them as no explanation has been provided to me why they are there from storyline standpoint. i mean if i want to put 1200 max run bpc's of fusion xl ammo into my corp hangar what prevents me from doing it ? being able to condense those bpc's into one 'item' would be good. as long as i could in theory start 1000 parallel 1000 run fusion xl jobs from that tiem as one can do currently with 1000 bpc's."
3/16/2010,"you want to lessen or even completely remove risks when dealing with bpo's. no.also, you want them to be represented in game with some kind of different interface. if ccp can't make bearable bpo managing system, for whatever reasons, what makes you think it will magically appear when renamed to some ""virtual servers"" ui ? especially when you not propose any specific improvements in this area ?"
3/16/2010,"they need to fix the industry ui, not destroy the market by allowing anybody and everybody to build battleships in every 0.0 station they podjump to.not supported."
3/16/2010,i keep forgetting or missing contracts because of no flash. would be nice to have.
3/16/2010,"hell yes, and this chart should also go in every econ dev blog published too."
3/16/2010,lie. there're almost twice more votes for fixing these exploits than total number of supports in this thread.
3/16/2010,"/signed. fix this! its insane that you can escape death in this way. eve is supposed to be harsh (apparently). seems most people are unaware of this get out of jail free card feature. makes a mockery of the game tbh. if your internet connection sucks so bad then don't undock in anything you can't afford to lose. i hate losing something as much as the next guy, but this is just a farce."
3/16/2010,"not support.it wasn't an exploit for more than 2 years, why it should be now? it's the same type mechanics as cloaked (macro)hunters - so it's should be fixed both or neither."
3/16/2010,"that's the truth.and gentlemen, please don't pay much attention to this bunch of low-sec pirates. all the rest of russian community, i'm glad to represent, is perfectly satisfied with width and flexibility of the features, eve-online offers to it's subscribers.the following is the result of poll that took place in a central russian-community resource:81 ppl would like those features to be eliminated160 ppl would like those features to be kept intact.ps. i beg a pardon, gents, but most probably i wouldn't be able to reply you. i can't read english. i can only write messages in english."
3/16/2010,"well, if 80+ is few - then yes, it's the truth :pyea, availability of exploits is flexibility of the features. great.it's a shame that you don't get that 3rd option ""no, i'm darkside member and feel butthurt"" isn't the same as ""no"". uniting them into one single option and summing number of votes is bad idea, mkay?"
3/16/2010,i agree. hate exploits and want them to be fixed.
3/16/2010,if that is the case than i am all for it. i was unaware that pvp timers and npc timers were different and honestly shocked that pvp timers are shorter since i assume this tactic is used almost entirely by the pvp crowd and not the npc crowd.as for that being basic game mechanics you are kidding yourself. unless you are actively trying to figure it out instead of just dealing with the occasional disco you are never going to know the difference between the two without combing some mind numbing pvp guide to ganking on some fanboy epeen website that 3/4 of the population could care less about.
3/16/2010,i support this message.
3/16/2010,this deserves support i think.
3/16/2010,"you certainly put a lot of work here, do you ?? how about instead of copypasting the links (which of course failed to paste) you go read them ?lots of these ideas are bit outdated, other linkies are here for the purpose of people to stop posting them over and over - because they were discussed ad nauseam and said to be not implemented for various reasons."
3/16/2010,"nope, i didnt put a lot of work in here, but one of the csm's claimed it was a lot of work to look in the forums and insisted these issues werent in the assembly hall forum. so i helped him out some. but hey, if they are out of date, then when they are presented ccp can say ""already implimented"" and they can move on. i just want the csm to actually propose ideas that the players want, not what they personally want as pvp'ers. did you read the minutes of the last meeting? it was a complete waste of time. they should be representative of us. so get some answers to some of our proposals, in this case some of the most requested proposals in ""features and ideas""."
3/16/2010,"so, you claim you want all these ideas to be implemented. more even, it is us who wants all of them to be implemented (rather brave statement).i will repeat, how about you go and actually read that stuff ?"
3/16/2010,"i simply pointed out that proposals have to be raised in the assembly hall forum and that it wasn't the job of the csm to go hunting for issues and raise proposals on behalf of people too lazy to do it themselves.if people cannot be bothered to follow the correct procedure then their ideas will never progress forward.is that clear enough?this is not a proposal, it is a wish list. each of these items would have to be raised as a separate proposal containing sufficient details to explain the problem and solutions. as this thread does not contain any specific proposal this is not the correct forum for it."
3/16/2010,the proposal is for you to address these issue at the next csm meeting. you have that proposal in front of you . or are you going to go back on your words now? are you afraid of a little work on your part?
3/16/2010,"that is not how the csm process works. it is not a matter of ""a little work"", you cannot game the system to put a list of 110 items into the agenda as one single proposal. even worse the items on the list don't contain any details required to make such a determination in the first place. lastly some of the list have already been submitted to ccp.if that is the best you can come up with then it isn't going to get looked at and at best will end up on the agenda purely to get rejected so we don't have to deal with such blatant disregard of the csm process in future."
3/16/2010,and even worse ... many of the items on the list had been reviewed by ccp/csm already.they are just listed as commonly proposed ideas to stop people from posting them *again*.which sadly doesnt work. you prove it again.
3/16/2010,"the original post contains a link to the message that lists all these issues with a link to threads on them. if your so self centered you wont even look at the issues the actual game players are requesting, perhaps your not in the right position. btw, from the last mission, you (general) seem to have disregarded the entire player pbase from what was posted in the minutes, so perhaps you process needs to be looked at....it clearly isnt working thus far..."
3/16/2010,"i see the ""dont change my game"" crowd has spoken up....look, the guy said he didnt have time to go looking for proposals, so i helped him out with a nice little link to the most common ones. and wheither or not previous csm's have looked over them doesnt mean later csm's wouldnt reverse their standing on any issue. if they are going to be our representatives on this board, then let them represent us. if they are going to play ego games, then let them pursue their own agendas as they appear to be doing now. going by those minutes the last meeting was worthless. lets see them actually do some work for us for a change."
3/16/2010,"that is not raising a proposal, that is attempting to put 110 items onto the agenda with absolutely no effort on your part.a proposal thread should consist of the issue and a proposed solution so people can support it (or not). simply linking to another thread is not the way to do it. linking to another thread with 110 items on it and saying that is a valid proposal is so false i don't know where to begin.because i refuse to write 110 proposals for you i'm self centred? check the last meeting thread, you'll see i raised 5 issues, z0d raised 3, aleks raised 1 - nobody else raised any issues at all and you are pointing the finger at me? what exactly are you on? yes, i ignored the whole player base when i raised issues that players had put as proposals into the assembly hall, following the correct procedure.oh wait, i didn't ignore them at all and their issues were discussed the job of the csm is to filter the issues raised in the assembly hall forum, pick the best and submit them to ccp.it is not the job of the csm to read every different forum looking for issues to raise on behalf of players like yourself who expect everything to be done for them"
3/16/2010,"nobody is asking you to read every forum, just features and ideas. would that be so hard? if your basing your whole representation on the vast minority that post on these forums, your doing a disservice to everyone. you raised 5 issues. wow. i am so impressed. it should have been 50. either your minutes are way incorrect or ya'll really wasted a lot of time during this meeting...."
3/16/2010,"*sigh* you seem unable to actually read my posts so i'm probably wasting my time.one last timeproposals for csm have to correctly raised in the assembly hall forumis that so hard for you to grasp? it would appear so. i can read the features and ideas forum all day, nothing in there can be submitted to the csm without a proper proposal thread in the assembly hall. that is simply one of the rules. coupled with that, csm are not expected to write these proposals for you, that is the only step you have to do but apparently that is far too much work and we should ignore all the people following the correct process to waste our time doing it for you thousands of other people are actively participating in the correct forum, why can't you?are you telling me that people who post in the features and ideas forum are somehow utterly unable to post the completed idea as a proposal in the assembly hall forums.really?don't you think it would be doing a disservice to the people who have correctly raised proposals in the assembly hall forum if instead of looking at their issues we spent the next 6 months raising and discussing the 110 proposals you've picked? that doesn't sound very representative, which is why each proposal in the assembly hall can be voted on so everyone gets a chance to support an issue.you call me self centred for refusing to spend 6 months of csm meetings dealing with a list of 110 issues that took you 30 seconds to cut and paste from another thread (and it was even too much effort for you to retain the links) read the raw logs, we dealt with 8 issues this time, a few of which were pretty simple and it still took over an hour to discuss them all. what planet are you from if you think that a 2-3 hour meeting could possibly deal properly with 50 issues? we don't just read out a list and say yes or no to them, we actually bother to read the proposals and discuss them fully. say we did plan to talk about 50 issues in a 3 hour meeting180mins / 50 proposals = 3.6 minutes per proposal.3.6 minutes / 9 reps = 24 seconds per rep per proposal your ignorance of the entire procedure is telling."
3/16/2010,eight whole proposals? thats amazing....you go to ccp to talk about the game face to face with them in order to represent the players of this game and you come up with 8 whole proposals to talk to them about.....two of which are self serving 1)increase length of csm term and 2)make csm more of a stakeholder (whatever the hell that means) in the process of making new features and expansions...i am so impressed. by 2025 you might just get to some important issues...
3/16/2010,"i guess we will see delenne sheridan in the next term to see how much better she will do.though you wont get my vote.last but not least ... assembly hall proposal that merge 2-3 ideas are bad already. because you can never tick the ""supported"" checkbox, if you dont want to support some pieces of the proposals. you drop 110 things at the us and expect we support all of them?even though your list contains things where ccp devs already stated that it would be too complicated to implement (joystick control) or that they will never return for various reasons (mines).but i am amazed. blaming others is so much easier than stepping up yourself.edit: wow, you are worse than i expected. you should really step up yourself and do some work before you risk such words. atm you behave like an idiot."
3/16/2010,"i didnt say everyone one of those things should be approved, i said they should be brought up with ccp and get an answer on why they can or can not be added to the game. i have no dog in this hunt, except wanting the csm to actually represent the players, and not their own narrow (8 total proposals) interests...."
3/16/2010,well then you should atleast sort out all proposals with dev replies and former csm proposing them already.
3/16/2010,"i really do suggest you read about the csm process and take a look at the minutes because you are making yourself look very very foolish right now.you seem to be confusing the csm meetings we have every two weeks with the iceland summit which happened in feb. because i have the numbers to hand i will show you how many issues we have managed to discuss per meeting...meeting 1 - handover from csm3, introduction from ccpno proposals discussed.meeting 2 - first proper meeting16 proposals discussedmeeting 315 proposals discussedmeeting 47 proposals discussedmeeting 56 proposals discussed, issues list finalised for the summit (ccp required it one month in advance of the meeting to schedule dev time)the list contained 14 major and 19 minor issues passed by the csmmeeting 66 proposals discussedcsm - ccp summit - many issues from the major list discussed as well as some of the previously raised issues and discussion on new features such as planetary interactionmeeting 7 8 proposals discussed (the 8 i talked about in my earlier post).so you'll excuse me if i stick to my opinion that a single proposal which attempts to raise 110 issues is utterly ridiculous especially as you yourself don't wish to put the effort in to raising the issues correctly"
3/16/2010,"out of 44 proposals, you could only work 8 in for a summit where you went to iceland? really? come on, you guys packed your stuff, flew or boated to iceland, sat down with the developers and for the time alloted you only got 8 items discussed...."
3/16/2010,get of your high horse. really. everything i could say to you know would mostlikely get me banned for offensive language.
3/16/2010,"delenne,i get the odd feeling that you have never worked for a company that holds meetings to discuss items of importance before. i have personally sat in numerous meetings at work where we take 2 hours to decide on the wording for a single paragraph of a document to distribute to the company discussing a minor policy change, and this is for around 100 people.you expect the elected csm volunteers to be able to propose and discuss numerous redundant items with no effort to define a possible fix in the short period of time they have allotted to them? you are, for lack of a better term, insane.perhaps, before yelling about topics that you pull from other threads, post in the wrong place, and scream about incessantly like you have done some real work, you should do some real work like teadaze has suggested."
3/16/2010,"who said we only discussed 8 issues in iceland? i stated earlier that the last meeting we covered 8 issues. the last meeting was on sunday, wasn't in iceland and didn't have any ccp people there because you brought it up, we had 28 separate meeting sessions over the 3 days in iceland and at least 20 of those were directly related to issues raised by the csm whilst many of the other meetings covered multiple issues too. oh and the ""self serving"" discussions were raised by ccp not csm, thanks for paying attention i have to thank you for your continued attempts to troll, i've not laughed this much in ages"
3/16/2010,just amazed that they go all the way to iceland to meet with the developers of a huge game and all they get done is 8 things....they were supposed to go with a list of 34 things....i guess we wil all just have to accept that there is no player representation in this game at all.
3/16/2010,reading comprehension fail!i like pieces of 8 though
3/16/2010,"i can't decide yet if you're incredibly dense, or having one heck of a troll run here. on the chance this isn't a trollgoing to the summit with 33 issues to discuss is a far cry from 8. please retake reading comprehension, thanks."
3/16/2010,"don't worry, they were issues no one really cared about anyway.the important stuff is generally ignored."

3/16/2010,a system a new character starts in...
3/16/2010,ccp wrote a dev blog about this a while backit also happened to get published on apr 1st
3/16/2010,"i like this idea not only for the suggested idea but also for these others ---#1) i think ccp will like it as an isk sink.#2) i have often thought of this as a way to possibly fix (or move in the right direction) the bounty mechanics in eve which everyone knows are completely broken.use concorde for hire (instead of using the isk as a bounty which is fricken useless) as payment for their ships/time to go out and hunt your known offender. this wouldn't be cheap and you would have to provide them intel as to the known system that person is in. if when concorde arrives there, the offender is not there, they wait a day and then leave. if you spent the isk and he wasn't there - oh well but at least it gives the opportunity to exact your revenge (for a price). dynamics: (before you all flame me) - you can only hire concorde for a certain period of time and only based on the standing loss of the other character that killed you). in other words, if you were popped in 0.0 - sorry you can't hire them. no whining. if you got popped in low sec (that would have to be either fine tuned on the sliding scale ccp developed for standing loss a while back or treated like 0.0). maybe you can only hire a few frigates or one bs depending on the level of the offense in other words.#2b)finally, as always, this would add some cool purpose to eve in the fact that intel would gain some importance other than just for pvp fleets and transporting goods. you might see headhunters corps (like merc corps in eve) spring up as legit careers. and as always, concorde ships are vulnerable to attack and would have to be paid for accordingly (in other words, if you want to make sure that you get your man, you have to hire accordingly the amount of ships and that is gonna cost you.) i think these concorde hired ships too should be allowed to travel into 0.0 and should be constrained to the normal gate mechanics (if your target lives in deep 0.0 it will be hard to reach him)."
3/16/2010,"how ? by making some npc's who do the work instead of them ??so can you choose your mind please, concord goes to 0.0 or not ?? if yes, what a nice way to wage 0.0 wars, isn't it also, while we are here, i want to hire concord to kill my mission rats, and hire that industrial ships, who mindlessly wander around anyway to mine some ore for me."
3/16/2010,"there is a difference between ""do my work for me"" and ""watch my back so i can do my own work"" in this suggestion. if this is an anti tool mechanic, i'm all for it."
3/16/2010,"lets make invention less of a click fest please and improve some other stuff along the way.when invention came in the devs gave us the impression that the current ( now 3 years old ? ) state of invention was just going to be the first iteration and that there would be improvements coming.like many things in eve once its out there and the most obvious bugs are fixed invention has been forgotten about and we have had no further improvements or tweeks.1) improve the interface - invention broke my mouse , no really it did the left button no longer works correctly after all those clicks.a batch job run would be excellent.instead of selecting 1 bpc and doing all the clickies, select multiple bpc's of the same type and insert the jobs all at once.options include [x] in parallel or [x] in series.parallel jobs would use multiple slots at the same instalation based off free time and use up the players science jobs 1 per bpc up to the maximum the player can start.series jobs would use only a single slot and would take x times longer to complete where x is the number of bpc's selected max ( 30 days ).this option would only use up 1 player science job.2) remove the -me -pe protection given to bpo holders.invention jobs with the worse possible or no decryptor should start from me 0 pe 0 , bodging in the -me and -pe for invented bpc copies was a unwarrented extra cost lumped onto the invented copy builder over and above what is required for a bpo build.invented bpc's already have the extra overhead of dycryptors which is substantial.3) allow me and pe of input bpc to have an effect on output bpc me and pe.e.g.output me = base me + ( input me / 10 ) 4)add unrepairable damage to interfaces.interfaces wear out after 100 jobs and need to be replaced.this is so that explorations drops of interface build components and bp's are not so utterley worthless as they are today."
3/16/2010,"1. yes.2. yes!3. yes!4. once upon a time, those things were worth something. now, they drop like candy given out by creepy clowns. this should be fixed."
3/16/2010,while i agree with 1 to 3.... 4 would drive my corp nuts. we would need like 25+ interfaces each month.
3/16/2010,"you just need to treat them more like you currently treat dycryptors.making them a consumable item alters the cash flow from invention down to exploration.points 2&3 would make dycrytors somewhat less necessary and make them more of an option rather than a requirement as they are atm for a lot of invented items , esp ships iirc.point 4 counterbalances this somewhat by adding value to interface build components.so impact on explorations drops.2&3) less iskies going to exporers for dycrypters ( radar ) currently uber4) more iskies going to explorers for interface bpc's and components ( magnetometric ) currently pointless.overall invented build costs should come down due to reduced moon goo requirements.meaning cheaper t2 ships and mods for everyone \o/."
3/16/2010,"hint ... if you run 2500+ inventions per months it is mostlikely not ships, so i mostlikely dont use decryptors. 2500 decryptors?"
3/16/2010,"as you stated, it should differ between the interfaces. ccp would likely have to work out the lifespan of different interfaces."
3/16/2010,"ok so your looking at 25 interfaces a month.the cost of those if there rig/module interfaces is going to be peanuts compared to the mineral/moon goo you will save on the build.if your not doing the build but selling the bpc's then the extra margin on the build is of course reflected in the value of your invented bpc.why do you say it would drive you nuts ? are you refering to cost or the hassle of obtaining them ?yup this too , there no reason why high throughput interfaces [rig/mod] couldnt take less damage than low throughput interfaces [ship]the only reason for 4 is too keep some cash flowing back into exploration and too provide some differenciation in build cost between invented bpc's and t2 bpo's."
3/16/2010,well. i dont know if enough of them drop in eve so there wont be a shortage. :)
3/16/2010,"as alot of people use destroyers for salvaging and there isnt much insentive to go into t2 destroyers for anyone but those living in 0.0, why not make a t2 salvage destroyer?this is the ship i was thinking of:turret slots- 0launcher slots- 0high slots- 8med slots- 3low slots- 4rig slots- 2destroyer bonus- 5% bonus to max velocity per level, 5% to cargo size per level[t2 ship skill]- 7.5% bonus to salvager chance, 7.5% bonus codebreakers and anazlyzer module access chance per level.role bonus: 100% range and velocity of tractor beamsskills needed-[t2 skill]destroyer lv5[possible skill needed- salvaging lv5]race frigate skill lv5spaceship command lv5tell me your ideas on this and what could be improved, i included the salvaging lv5 skill so people dont just go for the ship without going for t2 salvagers and getting a bigger bonus for less time. also the destroyer could be split into different ships each giving a bonus to either salvagers, codebreakers and anazlyzers.edit: added role bonus and increased t2 bonus from 3% to 7.5% because of loss of rig slot for t2 ships"
3/16/2010,sounds good
3/16/2010,"to me the idea sounds good as well. but i still think salvaging should get more love by modules not ships. therefore a salvager destroyer should add performance to existing modules and enhance them like a longer distance for tractor beams.also i foresee a problem to make the salva-destroyer useless by only having 2 rig slots. if you fly a ""salva-cane"" or a ""salva-myrm"" with 1700m3 to 2000m3 cargo and 3 rigs you would loose 10% of a chance to get salvage. at level 5 only a plus of 5% compared to a salva-cane is not worth to take on the trouble loosing so much cargo. unfortunately if it comes to ships you will likely get bashed to train a marauder as heard so often."
3/16/2010,"good idea, long overdue."
3/16/2010,"it's a nice idea, but not supported.the 100% tractor range/velocity bonus needs to stay squarely in the arena of marauders or other larger specialized mission runners.as it stands this salvaging destroyer would make missioning in most hisec hubs impossible for anyone running a t1 battleship/salvager dualbox.if it was to be considered more seriously, it would have to come with a paper-thin tank and some changes to mission/deadspace aggression mechanics."
3/16/2010,how would this make missioning impossible in mission hubs?you can't tractor beam wrecks that you don't own.
3/16/2010,"incidentally, a t3 pilot with level 5 in the electronic subskill of whatever t3 ship he is flying, can get a 100% bonus to range/velocity of tractor beams also with the right module. and t3 ships are considerably smaller then mauraders. i would hardly consider an orca or rorqual a mission running ship also.personally i would love to see a ship designed for the mini professions of hacking, archeology and salvaging."
3/16/2010,"yep, but t3 ships are very limited by expense (although becoming more common) and i've never even seen a ninja/griefer attempt to bug people using a rorqual or an orca - so that's a strawman at best.i imagine the t2 destroyer hull being discussed here would be far more available for around 20-40m."
3/16/2010,t2 bs and t3 cruisers are hundreds of millions in price. a t2 destroyer is tens of millions. it would seriously reduce the value of t2 bs and t3 cruiser (or at least make the sub not worth buying) to have a t2 destroyer with similar capabilities.
3/16/2010,"t3 cruisers are already down to 300m material costs (and that is buying from sell orders, buy orders could cut off another few millions). we are far away from the former 700m-1bn."
3/16/2010,yes.t3 cruiser = ~$300mt2 bs = ~$600mt2 destroyer = ~$30mthat's what i'm getting at.
3/16/2010,"oh i would be all for a 30m isk t2 salvage destroyer, the thought of training and building a second tengu for my wh character is.. well daunting what with the huge *** ""go get your 12 friends with battleships!"" target that a t3 paints on your backside in a wh.so yeah.. a cheap(er) way to get the tractor beam range bonus would be freaking awesome.edit: self censored word"
3/16/2010,"indeed, they put a developer or a whole team on trying to make this change, it will take them some time to figure out how to work their forums and make this change, please be patient. it isn't like some of those crazy forums you've seen before on the internet where an administrator like logs in and goes into the settings to change things this is all tied up in a 7+year old game's code, people have to be consulted and tracked down before a meeting can be held about how exactly this thing is gonna happen, if in fact it can even be done man."
3/16/2010,"there is just one little flaw. you can't organize yourself in a ""human"" corp and have this goal. topic supported. if you can pay to wardec one must be able to pay not to get wardecced. if you wanna fight get out to 0.0 and look for equal opponents not noobs in high sec."
3/16/2010,"now i usually don't reply to ideas that keep carebears safe however, what if there was a silent auction if corp a wardecs corp b. corp be can either take it like a man (ie all jump ship and make a new corp like they do) or they can make a counter bid to concord. if corp b elects to make a counter bid to concord corp a is given another chance to up their bribe but they do not know how much corp b is giving so whoever bribes concord the most determines whether there is a wardec or not. now i like this idea mainly because it is an isk sink and an interesting one at that. it gives the carebears a chance to fight back with the one weapon they have their wallets and it takes money out of the game which is always a good thing."
3/16/2010,and what is stopping you from organizing yourself into a corporation without being in a corporation?or are you just being ignorantly foolsih?the corporation system is just that.... a system... no one is stopping you from getting a band of npc pilots under a flag out of game...all it takes is a website or some sort of centralized communications platform and you got yourself a working team.the only thing your not getting is a corp hanger... the ability to drop a pos... and a centeralized wallet.but you get war dec immunity and you get ot do whatever it is you want to do until you feel strong enough to handle the problems.hell make a 1 man corporation if you want it that bad and then go from there.but seriously people.... engage brain before posting please.
3/16/2010,set the fee to 10 bill a week and i'll support it.
3/16/2010,"the ""only"" things you have mentioned are exactly the things a corp want to have. website is of course not the problem.one more thing. if you dont like the idea itself don't make the mistake and accuse people of beeing ignorant and neglecting brain usage. doing so you end up, like just demonstrated, as such a person who is ignorant and not using his brain cause it does not come to your mind that one want to have exactly the features you just dismissed. besides it makes you sound awfully childish. oh and of course price can't be more then wardeccing itself. so 10 billion is to much i am afraid."
3/16/2010,enjoy your blissful fun in high sec and let me know how it works out for you.i'll be taking tear donations as you continue to whine and complain.when your ready to put your brain into gear let me know... otherwise keep on crying.
3/16/2010,"you can pay to not get wardec'd already. 1. pay a merc corp to roll the corp that dec'd you. 2. put your stuff on contract and move somewhere else where you don't have to worry about the dec anymore.3. pay the ransom you most likely were asked for.4. tell them to go shove it and everyone in the corp plays on alts in an alt corp for a week or two.5. dissolve the corp, then make a new one.you have 5 ways to deal with wars. paying ccp fake money to protect you from ebil piwats isn't going to be an option."
3/16/2010,"sorry none of you suggestions are oriented on the topic. from 1 - 5 you have been decced already. the idea is not to get bothered with a wardec at all. high skilled pvp people, like you i guess, should fight high skilled pvp people. not industrials which hardly make it lvl2 mission niveau.see it positive. this way you would have only worthy opponents left. why shouldnt it be an option? you have to pay ccp fake money to declare war."
3/16/2010,i'm in an industrial corp.industry and pvp are synergistic. you fail to comprehend this.
3/16/2010,"awesome idea but a little change is needed ,instead of sending money to npc corp you should send it to me :)1bil/month should be enough.btw send an offer for the wardecking corp that you surrender and pay :d"
3/16/2010,"lol. yeah they are just totally useless, and the whole point of t3 was to fly around unprobeable. man this thread is stupid."
3/16/2010,"even with these tricks t3 still remain less played than marauders.for being the ccp stated versatile ships with t2 alike cost (but without t2 0.0 alliances materials monopoly) it is not really a great achievement.despite having squashed material costs on them, again and again.so the hidden pact comes: we get a blind eye or two about some peculiar... feature and you buy the ships because of them.btw a gm told me that they are aware of this ways of fitting and so far they are allowed but they reserve to change them.so don't plan to necessarily sit on the luck machine forever."
3/16/2010,"so wait...a gm told you that ccp reserves the right to rework game mechanics?was that really in doubt?i mean honestly, did you really need a gm to tell you that ccp can change the way the game works if they want to? i don't think anyone here is harboring any illusions about that point."
3/16/2010,well they can certainly put a team on it in any case. :p
3/16/2010,"only if it were also required that corps purchase missioning licenses, ratting licenses, exploring licenses, market trading licenses, salvaging licenses, contract selling/buying licenses, and pvp licenses too.singling out one particular group of players, legitimate miners, for harassment in this fashion is ridiculous. if you have incontrovertible proof that a given character is a macro-miner report them to ccp. if you have a 100% foolproof means of detecting game macros make real world $$$ by selling it to game companies. otherwise, leave the miners to enjoy the game in their fashion while you enjoy the game in your own fashion."
3/16/2010,"in this thread i am presenting my 3 ideas on how to improve usability of eve a bit(we all know its needed).i put them all in one thread since its my believe they dont change any game mechanics but do improve the gameing experience.nr.1) more drag'n'drop ingame- make items in the market window d&d'able into chat windows and notes as you can do it with hangar items- make hangar/market items d&d'able into the search window of contractssaves alot of typeingnr.2) mail groupsi'd like to see that ccp introduces ""mail groups"" like we have them in current mail clients like outlook and thunderbird.- you add contacts(preferably by drag&drop) into the group, you can save those groups and make various of them.- contacts can be added without their approval- mails can be sent to its members the same way as with todays 'mailing lists'.i think this makes sending one mail to many contacts a bit less tedious.nr.3) give corps some financial analysis tools- most important give us charts and tables to categorize weekly/monthly income through tax/market-orders/donations - charts and tables with corp expenditures. maybe also add the possibility to manually add data like pos fuel cost.- overviews of total weekly/monthly revenue/profitsthats all for now. hope you like those ideas"
3/16/2010,i want this!
3/16/2010,"supported, i favour different hulls through bp so you have to buy new bp to make hull b, c, d etc and they should have some minor differences to justify the cost and physical changes, ie extra weapon high, more armour etc."
3/16/2010,"keep in mind that, as the devblog said, each skin ""weight"" around 4mb for old shaders, arond 2.5-3mb for new shaders, and they need to be in memory (cached or loaded on the fly) when loading grid..."
3/16/2010,i support fixing the eris to be useful in some way other than as a flying coffin. the heretic needs love too. making it a laser boat would be good since there's only one useful t2 small laser ship (crusader) so those of us that trained small lasers to level 5 for the slicer could have another ship to fly.
3/16/2010,"supported. i also think the heretic needs lasers rather than rockets. unless ccp is willing to give all races an interdictor that doesn't have to use that race's primary weapon type, the heretic shouldn't be forced rockets on."
3/16/2010,i was thinking that it would be good if once a year you could pay say <U+FFFD>10.00 for to have all your assets moved to one station. this would allow people to gather all there far flung assets as well as maybe speeding up the databases. im sure ccp could do with the extra revinue during this time as well.
3/16/2010,"lazy much?also how would we catch all those juicy pi<U+FFFD>atas err sorry hauler, if you could juts pay ccp once per year to move your stuff? last but not least ... you got courier contracts to move stuff around.that said ... not supported."
3/16/2010,this.
3/16/2010,"agreed. if you're willing to pay real world money to move your stuff, i am sure you would be willing to pay isk to accomplish the same thing, right?"
3/16/2010,"don't care if it's been brought up before, new csm and i don't think this is in the wiki.proposed by both astria tiphareth and rovan stargazer (click on the names for relevant threads)key points:npc distress calls broadcasted in local, or in-station quick timer (roughly 2-3 min) for response. can choose to assist either faction npc involved (civilians or pirates, etc) could enhance fwpvp distress calls: broadcasted in local as a ""warp to"" link would need timers and restrictions in place to prevent spam/abuse would enhance the ""butterfly effect"" and also new mission runners who may end up in trouble.this is not my idea but i think it could be implemented fairly easily and add a dynamic to the game that was lost when events were scrubbed."
3/16/2010,and what of the potential for spamming distress calls in local?
3/16/2010,"do people even read posts anymore?""would need timers and restrictions in place to prevent spam/abuse""there would have to be some way to prevent some person from spamming it over and over. a simple 30min window would do."
3/16/2010,sounds very promising and could prove to be a very interesting dynamic to add to the game. i'd definitely like to see ccp think about things along these lines.
3/16/2010,"alliance is knocking over a system. defending alliance starts dropping on top of them with x4 the numbers. all pilots of the alliance that are now outnumbered hit ""distress"" (as they are in distress). node crashes.or, the classic get someone killed by mission npcs to salvage their wreck after dropping the mission."
3/16/2010,"the node won't crash, it's the same as people spam local with fofofo and ascii art, or random links. nothing will change.well yeah, the fact that it may be a trap is one of the appeals."
3/16/2010,"no, it would be like the jet can spamming that used to plague 0.0 (to bring down a node before a tower/station could be reinforced).this can already be done by asking ""can someone help me finish this mission? i don't seem to have enough firepower :("" after having triggered all the spawns and dragged all the npcs to the warp-in point. some happy, helpful carebear will always try to ""come to your rescue"". often will apologize that they aren't able to help after you've caused their ship to explode. fantastic little scam."
3/16/2010,"local text and jetcans are two separate things.again, jetcans and drones, i.e. objects do cause lag.text in local causes the same amount of lag.but even then you can always choose to disable them then. or have them off by default.as to the scam you propose... cool? so what?it's part of the game."
3/16/2010,"i have no problem with the scam. 1. if these distress beacons were added, they would need to be a different overview class than other beacons. beacons are usually on in pvp (need to know if and where a cyno is popped, if for no other reason).2. if the beacons are off in pvp (due to the previously stated issue), people would have to switch them on once someone verbalized that they were actually under attack (at which point, it would have been just as easy to form a fleet).3. if they are on in pve, the first thing i would do (and will deny this to the grave), if i was fc'ing the gang, is have all the pilots attacking the ratters/miners pop distress beacons so it would make it difficult to fight back (cluttered overview). anything to make it easier to fight them, or more specifically, help the tacklers survive longer."
3/16/2010,"then show standings to the one doing the distress call.has been proposed before, will support again."
3/16/2010,#edit# forums futzed up my post...it's an issue as its already been laid out... get 200 pilots to issue a distress call simultaneously and you get a serious problem.can you say jita? : o p
3/16/2010,"would be best for the op to give a better explanation than just linking to a dozen pages of discussion. if these ideas are ironed out, then it seems like a good idea."
3/16/2010,"preface: i know this has been mentioned hundreds of times before so thus the title of my post (revisit), but i have not heard anything back from the csm on this and would like to know if anything is being done to move forward this very simple, helpful and wanted eve feature.proposal - modifying the icon pictures for most in game modules to provide graphics corner tags like t2 and t3 currently have.to elaborate:- t1 stay the same with no tag (essentially a tag in and of itself).- officer items get a corner tag (if you can imagine it) just like t2 or t3 (a little corner trianagle) but instead of the t2 or t3 symbol, an ""o"" standing for officer.- faction items (i.e gallente, dread guristas, corpus, etc.) get a corner tag with an ""f"" in it.- original blueprints get a corner tag or ""banner"" tag (a little rectangular box accross the top fo the icon square) that says ""bpo"" or ""original"".- blueprint copies get a banner tag or corner tag that says ""bpc"" or ""copy"".- other tag suggestions welcome.why? you ask would someone so ""stupidly"" suggest this (i say stupid because i am sure someone will try and flame the idea as seems to be the norm these days in life instead of providing constructive criticism)?because it helps when sorting your stuff; making sure you identify and transfer the correct item. but most importantly it saves time when it comes to the blueprints and having to right click and look at their properties.ccp made a step in the right direction with the last expansion and allowing people to look in containers from afar. how's about fixing something so simple like the bpo/bpc and other item tags. this is just good gui. besides, the graphics editing time ccp has to dump into it (which speaking as a graphic artist myself), the thousand of items this would apply to - this could be done in a matter of days by one serious working individual. and more importantly again save players(the customer) thousands of hours in right click time on bpos and bpcs (not to mention less heartache in other item identifying) if only the time was alotted because your vote here spurs the csm and developers on. thanks for your time and consideration."
3/16/2010,the only stupid thing i see is the refusal do to research as to why such ideas are refused.particularly when its obvious your too damn lazy to search the posts for that reason.but alas.... the ignorance must be bliss.ccp has said time and time again.... they cannot do what you want without scrapping the database and starting over.it's how its mapped out when it comes ot indicating whether a bpo is a bpc.yes...everyone and there mother would like it... but it ain't going to happen.so stupidly asking for it for the billionth time will not make it happen any sooner or any later for that matter.
3/16/2010,"ccp can fix the bpo/bpc issue , it would just be a lot of work for them.currently they dont seem to feel that the effort involved is worth the payoff.so every week up to 50,000 players have to make extra effort with bpc/bpo segregation.the scale of the problem and the number of people it negativelly affects does justify a fix imo even if it is a lot of unattractive grind for the devs .there are spare fields in the inventory table that could be utilised iirc.for example stack size.bpc's items are allways singletons.singletons do not use the stacksize field for inventory items.therefore if the stacksize is used to indicate runs remaining on the bpc it would be possible for the assets/items windows in the client gui to identify bpc's correctly.singleton stacksize[yes].....[0] [asssembled item or bpo][no]......[0] (not used atm)[yes].....[>0] [bpc with stacksize = runs remaining] (this is unused atm )[no]......[>0] [unassembled items or unresearched bpo stack]of course this is a quick and dirty and would introduce lots of bugs that would need to be hunted down, but it might be preferable to a database structure change that would require a substantial rewrite of a lot of the code.anyways whether its a database structure change or a quick and dirty, bpo/bpc differentiation is one of the most requested features in eve, so maybe the csm should get tough and stop taking no for an answer."
3/16/2010,"under the assumption that mining is a viable profession (at least it says so in documentation), then removing the insurance 'fraud' system would create a situation where minerals plummet in value due to the massive overproduction of minerals that currently exists. so, miners would make less isk, margins would shrink on manufactured goods, etc.what wouldn't happen is missioners being impacted, due to the payouts from missions remaining roughly the same.now, if you'd link the mission payouts to the mineral index, then everyone would feel the same amount of 'pain' and all would be good. as it is a single player can make more isk missioning rather than mining. although, i can easily run 3miners + orca as one player, but i cannot be as efficient missioning, so the isk 'hit' from each account being less efficient is made up from the multiple accounts.why does that matter? fact is, there are many players running multiple accounts just for mining. completely trash mining as a profession, then those players will either 1) cancel accounts or 2) quit playing. what? emorage? nah... i pay for my extra accounts via plex. if plex cannot pay for them and make additional isk profit, then those accounts will go away and ccp makes less real money. pretty sure i'm not the only player with that thought process.i do not currently engage in insurance fraud. i *do* like it much better than an npc buying raw goods. at least with insurance fraud you have to work at it by getting then researching a bpo, spend time blowing up your stuff, and acquiring the raw minerals that you may be lacking from your current mining exploits. you make slightly under market anyway from bs fraud.as the number of players increases in eve, then demand for minerals will increase and the 'problem' will solve itself as ship prices increase. that is, unless, more players just want to mine....."
3/16/2010,"the mineral price is a another problem. yes you will get more miners if the player base is growing. mining ist popular and the prices going down. that is the sandbox. adapt or die. but that is not my problem. i want solve the problem that the current insurance system is awfull, because it's a problem for the free marked."
3/16/2010,"whether you intended to or not, what your post is saying is that effectively eve has more miners than it's pvp population require. this situation has arisen because of the long term distortion of the mineral economy caused by t1 ship insurance.in short: miners have been addicted to npc buy orders, and now they're faced with going 'cold turkey' and competing in the player economy.some people will retire their mining alts; many more people will still need their isk making alt to make isk, so they'll respec those alts in to invention or production or research or ratting or whatever until the economy rebalances."
3/16/2010,nice pic... so how is it you get the snaz new scorp model months ahead of schedule? or is that already seeded on sisi (haven't logged there in months).
3/16/2010,"since the latest expansion they have fixed the aspect ratio problem i was experiencing with my triplehead2go setup. (3x1680x1050 screens) eve running at 5040x1050 is truly the only way eve should be played. i'll be sure to slap some pics here when the eyefinity 6 edition comes out. i got the 6 screens ready to go, just need the card now. hopefully it will just work out of the box."
3/16/2010,/threaddamn! i needed that laugh.

3/16/2010,"will check out the meetings now, thanks for the prompt posting."
3/16/2010,"doh, fixed"
3/16/2010,"really?even leaving that out, the problem of those missions is that they are ill thought ans made in a way that scream ""easy targets here"" for all you pvp guys. no one like to be the cannon fodder for the enjoyment of other people. even less if they have to pay for that."
3/16/2010,"hey don't get me wrong, if something is broken it should be fixed but pottsey's concern of 'being pushed into pvp situations' is rather silly given that this is eve."
3/16/2010,"sokratesz said hey don't get me wrong, if something is broken it should be fixed but pottsey's concern of 'being pushed into pvp situations' is rather silly given that this is eve.its not silly if you look into it. sending big slow pve setup battleships 15+jumps for a 30+jump round trip all to the same system is not fair or right. no matter where you are in gallante space the new missions send you to the same system. as all the pve people are sent to the same spot there is a massive pirate camp at the gates. if we are setup for pvp we cannot do the missions, if we are setup for pve we die to the camp. not to mention the problem of 30plus boring jumps in a battelship. all that for no reward. pve people are not pvp people and we are not bait so the pvp people have easy targets. pushing pve people into pvp is not only flat out wrong but its a good way to make all the pve people quit the game. if we wanted to do pve mixed with pvp we would join faction warfare. i would also question how pvp is the driving force of the economy considering how few people do pvp and lose ships. it wouldnt surprise me if more ships are lost in pve then pvp.eve is not a pvp only game. a large amount of the player base do not to combat pvp and have no interest in combat pvp.edit: in my mind ccp's biggest mistake it to try and push to many pve people into pvp. things like that can kill games. if ccp role out the gallante changes to all races i bet a large amount of people quit."
3/16/2010,"great, so we agree that it is broken and needs fixing, the pvp/pve discussion isn't even part of this."
3/16/2010,"fixed it for you.also, how do pvp'ers maintain the price of lp and highend loot if 99% of pvp'ers don't fit faction/meta4 stuff on their ships?i think, if less of it got evaporated, the price of it might fall to a level that would make faction/meta4 items viable on pvp fits. as for the price of faction gear, that is also artificially kept higher than it's real value due an artificial price floor created by isk costs for certain lp store items.so no, pvp'ers don't do squat to keep the economy going. in fact, because of insurance, they do more harm than good. another thing to note is that a healthy economy will see a slight rise in prices every year. in eve, prices either fluctuate more than a bouncing ball on crack, or they slowly decline.so either there are way too few people loosing ships (which is supposedly what happens when you pvp), or your theory about pvp'ers keeping the economy healthy doesn't hold any stock.either way, i don't see any new mechanic implemented to force pvp'ers to do 10+ jumps in pve fitted ships to an area surrounded by rats, in addition to having no other form of protection, so i don't see why pve'ers should be forced in to unreasonable pvp situations. in all fairness, it's not balanced.the equivalent to pirates would be that from now on, -10 pirates need to make 20 jumps through highsec every time they loose a ship. and while in highsec, they'd be considered ffa (the pod), but not be allowed to shoot back."
3/16/2010,are we playing the same game?
3/17/2010,"i believe that was at fanfest..... maybe it was only a ""font guy"" and not a ""typography expert"".is there a chance this most valuable staff member has been sitting idle eating donuts waiting to be given the job of fixing the most important issue in the game?maybe they've been working on designing fonts for expansion youtube trailers...."
3/17/2010,yes
3/17/2010,yes
3/17/2010,the eve font is terrible. it coulf definitely use being revisited.
3/17/2010,"i do not care about csm, and i like this idea. assault ships are meh nowadays. everyone is using faction frigs.i say, either give em another bonus or give em an extra module slot."
3/17/2010,"i also approve. i like them mighty good, and do think they could be better.however, an ishk boost might not be fair, that ship is good as is."
3/17/2010,"when are you jumping the jf full of minerals to our home base dude? or do you not look at material amounts? are you one of the minerals are free crowd? do you get minerals spawned in your hangars? or are you really dumb? if an apoc needs only 7 mil trit in comparison to 10 mil trit for a rokh, guess which one is going to get built? that is what makes or breaks the deal. hype suffers from the same cost issue, it's just that caldari are stuck with the rokh for any kind of sniping and thus the problem is more acute for them.yaay, i am sorry to inform you that you did not answer any question, you just demonstrated your ignorance and shortsightedness.you obviously fail to understand what is the issue here. it's not bs fits, or hac fits. it's not gallente or caldari fitting requirements (even thought the shortcomings in that area make the w/s even harder to deal with). it's weapon balance and the fact that amarr have been op for too long, matari caught up to them and rails are left back in the dust. if you need to invest more in minerals and fittings to get the same performance between the races, there is a disparity.if you can't wrap your head around that, and you think that fitting faction and expensive named items will solve the problem, please contract such items to me in game. isk donations in the bils are just as good though.do you really think that proposing a rigged bs that costs twice as much as the rest of the other bs show that there is balance between weapon systems? is it the fact that you haven't flown a gallente or caldari railboat that makes you shortsighted or are you afraid that the amarr boats you fly will not be that op if rails get boosted?"
3/17/2010,"it doesn't cost 2x as much, quit saying it does. if you are having logistical issues, that's a totally different problem, not cost.here's a good thought, you can fit about 20 hypes in a freighter, or about 8 in a jump freighter, a few runs and you have enough to last your boys a while, unless you just really suck and lose ships a lot. if you're really packing minerals, i believe it jumps to about 50 bs worth of hyperions in a freighter. wtf is your alliance doing to lose more than 50 of one racial bs a month?you can't argue that a ship isn't worth the isk because it's hard to build. you still get the same 0 sum gain/loss once insurance is paid based on jita mineral cost as you would a tier 2 or tier 1. that fitting i popped up had no faction on it, so where that comment came from is beyond any logic i can think of.i don't fly gallente right now because ranged warfare in general is dead. bs ranges are far more practical in the 50-70km ranges which suits amarr and minmatar better. this is a result of the increase in bombers, and the overpowered nature of rr platforms. if you want to argue that blasters need a serious boost, fine, you'd be totally right about that.but i have flown gallente quite often in the past, and i really do like the hyperion for ranged fleets. the point is, you can't boost rail damage and think that's going to solve this problem you're stating is a problem. it's just going to bork the system in some other way, just as it has the past gazillion times the devs have tried it with a gun platform.the rokh is what it is, change the ship stats if you don't like it, but don't change the rails because 1 ship doesn't perform well with them. when it comes to dps, most other ships fall in line quite well, whether you see it or not."
3/17/2010,"i said nothing about the apoc being more cap stable. but, your argument is that cap stability doesn't matter anyway, so i really don't understand your point. also, with max related skills, i run low on cap in big fleet fights flying ships that are cap stable without mwd running, due to the constant short warps (would be my guess). having a hard time understanding how a ship without boosters that lasts only a few minutes just firing its guns would survive very long in a fight. unless it spends a lot of time hiding in safe spots.your weapon of choice now is lasers. back in your bob days, you were flying with hybrids. you stopped using them, but are trying to claim they are on par? unless, of course, you realized hybrids are inferior to lasers and prefer the inequality over balance? i really can't blame you, as i did the same thing. the difference being i would prefer hybrids to be fixed, rather than left as the fool's weapon of choice."
3/17/2010,"i use lasers because i use pulses, which are mid range weapons that gallente just don't have. that's more an issue with blasters than it is with rails. blame rr fits and the pulses if you're going to go down that road. as for the harbinger, i use it more because the brutix is incredibly terrible on fittings. i use the absolution more because the passive boost to hp is more useful in most fights than the active tank of a rail astarte, and i hardly ever use close range weapons on a t2 command ship unless i fly a sleipnir, which i hardly ever fly because the hurricane is so damn good for way less money.as for the capacitor, the hype has enough to last for more than an entire clip of ammo. assuming this game has flaws, omg impossible, no gun every fires exactly at it's intended rof in fleet lag, even when it's better than post dominion. it only takes 1 second of delay between shots for the capacitor to be stable. you also have 10 seconds at least of delay every 40 rounds of ammo, which again builds your cap back up.if you're using your mwd, your goal is almost always to escape a situation and warp out. no bs fit is cap stable with mwd on for fleet combat. almost every fleet sniper bs fit has about 1 min 30 seconds or there abouts with it's mwd on. no competent fleet fit maker is going to worry about the mwd issue."
3/17/2010,"looks at blueprints. looks at faceless alt. considers which one is right.if you need to procure more minerals to build a ship, it costs more. time to gather the resources is not free. isk is not an issue, nor logistics. however if we jump a freighterload of minerals, why not optimize their use? why not make the more out of it? why build 20 hypes and not 35 apocs? since you know, 20*401= 8020 while 35*370= 12950.yep, sure is. no fleet fights are happening, keep believing it."
3/17/2010,"it doesn't matter if you do not have pilots to fly them. if you're just telling me you're lazy, fine, you're lazy. that's not a reason to avoid the hype. some of us do the work, and reap the rewards.if this is the logic you are using to balance ships, seriously, thank god you're not a dev."
3/17/2010,"yaay you are so wrong.cap stability matters:it can run out in ordinary fights especially when you shoot structures (which is part of snipe bs role no matter what you think)+stupid hybrids need ammo too not like op lasers which can be fine with some m3 never ending crystals,but hey according to you it is balanced somehow....oh and usually you warp in off regularly in a balanced fight+ you have to use mwd to spread out and get out of bubbles-->hybrid ships runs out of cap even faster.oh and if you are low on cap and still need to mwd because your fleet just warp out then game over for u.cost:yeah tier 3 cost as much as tier 2 if you buy it insure and loose it before insurance is over, most of my battleships havent blowen up before insurance is over --> tier 3 costs a lot more than tier 2,you know the point is not to loose your ship usually :)oh and if your corp produces the battleships (which imho most 0.0 allience do ,who happen to be the only ones using sniper battleships strange isnt it?) tier 3 needs more minerals --> less ships can be built from the same amount as for tier 2 battleships.lag:oh there is a lag so you cant run out of cap,wohooo ,but suddenly refire delay lowers hybrids dps.lets calculate with real datas.assume a 1 sec delay between repeats, assume 20sec reload delay.without lag stats:hyperion 2110 alpha/5.26 sec 402dps 40ammo/clip, with reload 40*2110/(40*5.26+10sec)=383dpsrokh 1736alpha(lol)/5.108sec 340dps 40ammo/clip, with reload 324dpsabaddon 3453 alpha/6.88 sec 501dps assume unlimited, with reload 501 dpsapoc 2841 alpha/6.88 sec 412dps assume unlimited, with reload 412 dpsmaelstrom 6737 alpha/15.91sec 423dps 20ammo/clip ,with reload 20*6737/(20*15.91+10sec)=410 dpshmm even now hyperion is below the rest-> rails suxwith lag:hyperion 2110 alpha/6.26 sec 337dps 40ammo/clip, with reload 40*2110/(40*6.26+30sec)=301dpsrokh 1736alpha(lol)/6.108sec 284dps 40ammo/clip, with reload 253dps(lool crap)abaddon 3453 alpha/7.88 sec 438dps assume unlimited, with reload 438 dps apoc 2841 alpha/7.88 sec 360dps assume unlimited, with reload 360 dpsmaelstrom 6737 alpha/16.91sec 398dps 20ammo/clip ,with reload 20*6737/(20*16.91+30sec)=366 dpsyou see in laggy situations hybrids is even worse because their low rof time lag affects them more.last nail in the coffin:ammo use during half hour of shooting amarr 0m^3hybrids (8*2m^3)*1800sec/(40*5.26s+10s)=16(m^3/clip)*8.18(clip fired)=131m^3 auchprojectiles (8*0.5m^3)*1800sec/(20*15.91s+10s)= 4*5.48=22m^3so this show hybrids usually run out of ammo during ops my experience confirms this, keep in mind you have to bring more than one type of ammo i usually bring 5 types.so i ask you (these stats are real you can check it yourself), do you still think hybrid guns are balanced?the fits werent included due to space issue."
3/17/2010,"i think you're proving the point that blame is in areas other than a raw damage boost. lower capacitor needs, lower pg/cpu needs, double the clip size. all three of those would bring it more in line with what you just pointed out.i never said they were balanced, i said i'm not a fan of a direct damage boost being the balance they need.if you do what the op says, we'll see a hyperion at nearly 490 dps, and it's just going to become the new flavor of the week until *****ing generates another damage boost somewhere else."
3/17/2010,"exactly. what do you guys think will happen on this forum if hybrids gets boosted?. i hope your not so dumb that you think that the projectile whines wont come back in full force all over the places here.if we boost hybrids, then we are back to the projectile whines. i'm 100% sure about that.and not only that, when lasers first of all is overpowered, then why boost railguns to something that is overpowered?.hello, jesus christ, don't be stupid.but i'm all in for making the railguns easier to fit some some caldari ships and other gallente ships that have powergrid issues."
3/17/2010,"people don't realize that at one point in time, 300 dps was considered a lot for a bs. usually it was average of 280 for a sniper fit. from all the blancing the devs have tried with raw dmg boost, we're now up to 400+ dps on bs and still, they're not considered balanced. obviously damage boosting isn't working."
3/17/2010,then why not just rebalanced all weapons. i also think that rails/blasters/lasers should also be able to wider variety of damages. em/therm/explosive laserstherm/kinetic/explosive railsthe ratio of damages would vary depending upon particle stream and or materials used.currently missiles and projectiles are the only ones that can pick which damage type they want to use. course this is super advanced sci-fi based game why not push the boundaries farther with rail gun ammo that acts like projectile ammo. this new form of rail would always do kinetic damage + another form depending upon type of new ammo that paralells projectile types.
3/17/2010,"which is why we're obviously not agreed a straight damage boost is a good idea, but on the other hand the figures don't lie and clearly railguns are the bottom of the heap in terms of how much firepower they can bring to a target.how do you fix this without bringing in a damage boost?lowering pg or cpu requirements will do absolutely nothing to fix this, because fitting more broken weapons to my ship doesn't change or negate the fact that they still suck and will keep sucking no matter how many of them i'm able to use at once, nor will their damage profile improve dependent on how many more unrelated modules i'm able to fit on the platform that carries them.assuming ccp decided tomorrow to make the damage output of all weapons systems equal... thus eliminating that argument from the equation completely, how would they go about maintaining a flavor for each weapon system without overly breaking one of them? because even if you nerfed everything back into the 300dps bracket..railguns would still suck due to tracking, need to reload and limited damage profile.the combination of moving the armor hole from thermal to explosive really didn't help their case either (this is before my time - but i heard it mentioned occasionally)so can we please try to think of a solution to the problem that does not involve overpowering the weapons nor involves ineffective changes to fitting statistics that will do nothing to alter their lackluster in-game behavior."
3/17/2010,"that's why you trained amarr instead of flying hypes?please stop lying to yourself. if hype was the op ship you talk about, fleets would be composed of it. however, all i see in fleets are apocs, pest and megas (for the people that haven't skilled amarr yet). your doing eft warrioring and not considering the complete picture. fyi, for the 401 dps hype, there is the 446 dps tach abaddon, which costs roughly the same. so throwing numbers around without looking at the underlying structure and relations is totally bull****.i see people yapping: ""this is not the way to do it, you are trying to make the railguns op, blah...blah...blah...""do you realise that even with 15% damage increase, rails will do less dps than the equivalent laser boats? how does that make them op? maybe i am not a dev, but i can see where there is a glaring imbalance and have a proposal to fix it. what is your counter-proposal?if you can come with a better way to fix the railgun problems, which are universally accepted (low damage, high cap consumption, huge fitting requirements, small clip, slow reload, bad tracking) without making them lasers, please do the math and propose a solution."
3/17/2010,"for god sake, how many times does it have to be said. look at the ship fits, they're all pulses. pulses > blasters for fleet work. it has nothing to do with rails. use some common sense.fittings equate to a damage boost. if you can fit a 4th mag stab in place of a rcu on any sniper bs, it's about a 6% damage boost if the player so chooses.you can also change clip size, change cap use, change tracking, and whatever else.... all of which do not require a direct damage boost. all of which benefit the ships performance in fleet. why don't you instead argue about why sniper combat is nearly dead in this game. rr is taking over, and that's a much bigger issue than you've made rails to be."
3/17/2010,"omg why everyone wants to compare railguns to tachyons? it's completely wrong because noone takes into account their huge fitting requirements so you need to fit only 7 guns to fit it for pvp, not for eft-warrior mode. also i loled at this tachyons armageddons as kind of arguments - ok go fit and try to fly it.the only thing you may compare to railguns are megabeams.high cap consumption you say? try to fly abaddon, maybe you'll want than to fit artillery or even railguns on it instead.tracking - isn't this 37.5% tracking bonus on megathron enough?don't forget that the balance is not just the numbers in 2 different modules - it's much more completely concept that affects all the ships parameters, their bonuses and modules they can fit to.anyway blasters really need more love, it's all fine with the railguns."
3/17/2010,has anyone associated with ccp acknowledged the problem with hybrids? anyone know if they are even thinking about this problem?
3/17/2010,"lol ,so you want to tell ppl what they can use for their ships and what not?amarr can fit and use tachyons ,so why shouldnt we compare it to mega/rokh fitted with 425mm rails hmm?even if it need more pg/cpu apoc can be fitted with them and doing so it will be much better than any mega/rokh fit. what comes from it --> railguns are not fine-->need a boost.just look at my post it is clear evidence that rails lack huge dps compared to their disadvantages,a 15% dps boost would just bring them onto the same lvl as amarr/matar atm, it would still have many disadvantages.no lowering fitting is not an option it wont make them more worthy to be used, like the lower tier guns ,hell nobody uses them why? because they have crap dps/range no matter how easy to fit them.they needs an usable role where they are favoured over the beams/arties.yaay: strange where i fly we use mostly sniper fleets ,not some stupid rr ones which can be killed by a sniper hac fleet easily."
3/17/2010,"have you read the thread? nobody is comparing rails to tachs? the comparisons were made between the ships used as snipers sporting weapon systems that they were designed for, using same class modules.when comparing:apoc-(t2 mega beams), pest-(t2 1400mm), mega/rokh-(t2 425mm)andzealot-(t2 heavy beams), munnin- (t2 720mm), eagle/deimos- (t2 250mm)using 3x damage mods on each ship, it was shown that railguns are producing, on average, 15% less damage output than the other ships at the same range.please read the thread before you try to be a smartass about tachyons and abaddons, ok?"
3/17/2010,"sorry yaay, couldn't help but point out your change in weapon preference. the reason being both types of hybrids have been nerfed to hell and back. i remember, once upon a time, when railguns were worth fitting. i remember, once upon a time, when blasters were so good they were op (as opposed to never used because they are crap). my point is, and i think you would agree, now that projectiles are actually useful, hybrids need to be reviewed and made useful again as well (but not op). i think there is enough evidence to show that hybrids are less than similar fits across the board. in the end, it is ccp who makes the decision on how to balance them so they are once more useful. having seen, and experienced, the change to projectiles, i trust ccp to find and make a useful niche for hybrids to fill that has some bearing in combat.i also agree with your point about rr combat. however, it isn't something new. i think it may have more to do with an inability to play the ""my fleet has longer range than you and will be able to stay out of reach while popping your ships"" game that had been the strength of snipers for so long. part of this change may be attributed to the introduction of logistics and triage modules making defense so strong that snipers are incapable of picking off ships in the other fleet. i understand the attempt ccp was making to create longer battles, but they've side-lined snipers in the process. to resurrect snipers, they need to be heavy alpha, slow rof (similar to what any form of long-range combat is irl). this is part of the reason i had suggested that a way to fix rails would be a large boost to alpha, even if it kept dps as is."
3/17/2010,supported for rebalancing railguns and possibly re-evaluating caldari gunboats.
3/17/2010,"that's what i'm talking about. you're just comparing 2 numbers in one class called raw_damage_from_guns completely forgetting about another ship abilities.eagle? it can shoot up to 200+ with rails nor zealot/munin can do. and you want to add damage to it. think twice.deimos? yes this one is poor in sniper role but it has 50m3 dronebaynor zealot/munin has. and this ship ability can be used in some other way. adding damage bonus just to guns and keeping all other things will outbalance ships in different ways, so we'll see another whine thread again in the future."
3/17/2010,"it's obvious that you haven't read the thread, but you feel compelled to just throw random stuff in the conversation.stop being lazy and spew inanities, i am not going to repeat my self, it's 2 pages back, in black and white, go read it."
3/17/2010,"i have posted fits for both apoc and abaddon that easily work with tachyons. people don't use them for the previously stated decline of sniper capability in fleet warfare and the previous need for dd resitant fits (amarr ships trumped all with 3x dd proof + 150+km range + 300+ dps abaddon fits). incidentally, 425 rails have higher cpu requirements that eat up low slots in a similar way to the tachs. but even when snipers were good, and even if they were to magically return, rails < beams. what are fleet compositions now? ""amarr > minmatar > gallente > you will be primaried by your own fleet if you bring caldari"" gc fc (and i'm confident he is not the only one to say this).you bring up the tracking bonus of the megathron. even with the bonus, the mega has less tracking than apoc/abaddon. since you bring up bonuses and energy weapon cap consumption... apoc. but really, i was doing cap logi last night in a fleet and was receiving as many requests for cap from the megas as the apocs, only saw 1 abaddon who needed cap (the others seemed to be fine with their enormous hold full of 800s). had one douche in a sieged nag who kept asking for cap. in any event, megas or tachs, top damage went repeatedly to amarr and minmatar, with megathrons, hypes, and some rokhs way down the list.i repeat, this is not balanced."

3/17/2010,its just ccp force feeding pvp down the throats of the paying customers who do not wish to participate in that area of the game. unfortunately they wont change there attitude until some competition actually hits the mmo internet spaceships genre of game. eve has depth and is generally a fun game to play. unfortunately it also has a monopoly on good space sci-fi mmo. until black prophecy or jumpgate evolution come out there really isnt any competition for eve. (note i didnt mention world of star trek for a reason)
3/17/2010,"agree. but it is more. as it appears more and more pvpers are on the testserver and quoting and of course, they are directing the decisions a little bit. the situation shows, that 3 main factions of players exist.huge alliance players in 0.0happy and lucky pveers in high sec.the most unhappy group: lowsecs. why are they unhappy? hard to get along in the big battles. harder to do things in highsec. can not fly where they want. can not do what they want. ergo: complaining, whining like pussies. but they are paying customers. so ccp needs to react.at least there should be done something. i dont care about low-sec. missions which lead to lowsec, i dont care about, i click them away. it takes just a few missions, if you know what you do, to gain faction back, though u dont win anything when faction always is on 10.0.when i want pvp i go 0-sec. no faction hits. thats ok. i can understand that low-sec is kinda empty. but it wont become populated by pressing pvers into it with missions. those with ruined factions, bad reputation and lil chance to get their items, well, bad luck or like we say it in austria: ""gschissn grennt"".take this missions out.what they should do? bring a 1 time chance as a mission to regain reputation. but if they are pirates, lawlz, let them hang in lowsec :)cheers ikonia"

3/17/2010,"loot drop is just another feature and dimension part of the game and that you fight for. if it was a ""reward for killing a ship"" it would just appear in your cargo with you being declared the rightful owner to that loot. but it doesn't. when the loot drops it still shows as the victim being the owner. this isn't the game you think it is where you get ""prizes"" for completing a task. you have to fight for it tooth and nail. so please do htfu."
3/17/2010,hey so this annoyed me yesterday ... again. someday i'm going to need to pull those battleships out of the ass end of nowhere. come on ccp - let me contract them to my alts or alliance mates!-liang
3/17/2010,"if this was done, then said contracts need to show as ""damaged"", big bright red leters at the top of the contract, and players need an option to ""not show damaged contracts"".but, i dont actualy see this as the problem. the problem being there is no way to trade things to an alt character other then contracts or having them both on and at the same station.fix: the ability to alow players to trade to one another, regardless of what station they are at or weather both parties are on at the same time. this could be done with an option, like a friends list, a trade list, when you add some one to it, they can trade items to you, and said items will drop into the station bay from wich the trade was made from.and ccp, there does need to be a list, or some players will trade a single piece of ammo to random people at a thousand different stations, just for fun."
3/17/2010,with these options it is more then reasonable.

3/17/2010,"as discussed here: clone costs - punishing veterans for continuing to play their main?the linked thread has many points/counterpoints for/against the idea. many voiced better than i can put in this post so i would suggest a review of it. the oldest, most dedicated and supportive ranks of the player base seem to almost be punished just for being dedicated to their main characters.the cost for clones seem to scale at a higher than linear (almost exponential rate) for a reason i've yet to find (simply arbitrarily?) one could say clone costs scale at a seemingly unfair and illogical rate.i cannot see how this serves either ccp, the players or the health of the game overall (and this could be lack of imagination on my part).it almost restricts older characters from flying some of the more fun ship classes (who takes a 40mil clone out it in a </=15mil ship??? why should you face such a mandatory high penalty for pvp loss?). there are other insinuated/associated penalties discussed. loss in pvp is essential. i'm not suggesting otherwise. these losses present themselves effectively and in a balanced manner through ship costs, rigs, fitting, combat implants, etc... making the justification for current clone costs questionable.(warning: needless sob rhetoric ahead) this is eve. it should be harsh. i really hope i'm not coming across as looking for a handout to oldest players. without further clarification from ccp it seems the current clone cost scale seems to be more of a kick of sand to the face rather than a pat on the back or (at the least) a fair deal vs the lower clone tiers. one could view it as needless penalty for sticking around after years of continued support and continuing to play their main chars."
3/17/2010,supported.my reasons are in the linked thread.
3/17/2010,"not all high sp characters are in 0.0, bs, caps or titans.many like to fly smaller ships worth a fraction of the value of their clones.why should older players be forced to fly bigger ships just to get value for money?p.s. fix the eve font before dedicating time to any other issue, it's just getting ridiculous.next 6 month expansion could be the typogrowrath - ""the much anticipated critical expansion to the award winning mmo universe"".it should come with a cool sexy trailer showing how people no longer go blind playing eve."

3/17/2010,a very new topic. yes really new.
3/17/2010,"i apologize. i searched the linked thread lists in the sticky and found nothing. the eve search link suggested in that sticky gave me a 404, so i went ahead and started a new proposal thread. thanks for linking the previous though, if mods want to lock this i understand."
3/17/2010,not supported.... don't fly want you can't afford to lose.and those who have that kind of high sp should already know how to make a damn living.get a backbone people.... your embarrassing the veterans.don't like paying for a new clone? then stop dying so often!teaches you to be prudent... efficient.... a good steward... concepts in eve that are quickly fading.
3/17/2010,"i agree that the higher end clones seem to be too expensive. however, an asymptotic cost curve is dumb. i think we should just scale it linearly at the end and make it 5million sp per 1million isk clone cost instead of the 3:1 ratio as it is currently."
3/17/2010,this at least seems fair enough... but i do not want to see cheap assed clones at very high sp's.the last thing we need is an isk explosion because you can die more frequently : o p
3/17/2010,this.
3/17/2010,"not supported -it's tough enough to come in as a new player as it is, given you have to either roll specialized alts or spend over a year to train into anything remotely competent. given the way the training system works, you're almost better buying a 1yr sub in advance, training up a character and then learn how to play the game rather than ****ing around for months, unable to compete because you simply can't fly anything worthwhile when everyone around you is zipping about in hacs and capitals.the high clone costs are one of the few balancing mechanisms to make using high sp characters less attractive and allowing new players and low sp chars to be even remotely competitive.- unless, of course, your goal is to stop new people playing the game and have it die the slow death of dwindling playerbase?there's a fine balance between making a game challenging and making it so frustrating nobody will bother playing it."
3/17/2010,"you what?how on earth does reducing the cost of high skill point characters' clones make new players quit?your a fine one to bleat, the industrialist that doesn't pvp, we aren't talking about carebears who never get into harms way but people who enjoy a bit of pew pew and you don't qualify, your input is void, we could all hole up in a factory slot or whatever and run when a new red enters system, or is that what you are suggesting?"
3/17/2010,ok so you play for years and havent figured out some of the x ways to (semi)passively make money in eve?
3/17/2010,"the current clone cost system seems unjustified from a pure gameplay perspective. i've read a few of these threads and haven't heard one good reason for them, so unless ccp has a reason for it that hasn't been mentioned yet, the costs on high sp count should be made more reasonable."
3/17/2010,so what your saying is... you don't have time to make isk and would rather prefer to be able to freely blow stuff up and die many times and not worry about affording to pay for your clone.yeah... makes sense... must suck to be a horrid pilot in eve.guess what... nothing in game... even in life... is free... let alone cheap.adapt or die.... less.keep it coming... i'll need an another container for your tears.and before you blow off your smartass mouth again... we are subject to the same penalties and costs you are... we can die just as often as you can... so please... grow up and stop using pathetic excuses.you have no excuse... at that age and at that rate you should be able to make enough isk to pay for your measly clone... pa the tic.
3/17/2010,"if you cant afford a high sp clone then dont buy one.you will lose some skill points when podded next enabling you ""eventually"" to use a lower skilled cheaper clone.you may have to retrain some stuff that you lose and need.if you want the advantage of a high sp char then expect it too cost you , like any other expensive ship/mod in eve.nothing is broken here.o and also stop sucking so much and stop dying it really helps with clone costs."
3/17/2010,supported 100%
3/17/2010,"not supported in its current form.i support the general idea that the price scaling is wrong and making higher sp chars more risk averse.problem with original post:it lists what you can concede is a problem, but where one would expect at least a proposed solution/change, it is not even sketched out what should happen.as such you are abusing the ""[proposal]"" tag in the subject line and it seem appropriate to file it as unconstructive complaint.please draft a proper proposal, there is likely plenty of support out there if you bother to do it right."
3/17/2010,"it's not a question whether you can make enough money, it is a question why should you be forced to make enough money. and there is not reason, therefore, i support this proposal."

3/17/2010,"don't fly a pod if you're high sp and don't grind like a wow player?interesting position, if you're a cheap player who's been playing for a long time then according to drake you should never undock.this is about balacing it so the pilot has the choice of flying small ships if they so desire.as for pilot ""skill"" and losing pods......... heard of lag?"
3/17/2010,"cripes, stop training skills that don't help you make isk, learn to make more isk and stop being a whiner.or pause your uber costly main and train one of your alts to fly small ships and die when you want to be in a small ship."

3/17/2010,ye
3/17/2010,"while my base clone cost is still cheap, i can see this is a problem (opposed to people saying ""oh no the vets have so much already""). a vet shouldn't be locked out of flying many classes of ships, or be forced into more carebearing for the same loss.otoh, maybe this is ccp's way of saying that more experienced players should leave 0.0 for lowsec, where the real pvp happens ;)"
3/17/2010,"i like the idea. it would seem it's more a matter of server side logistics, since each station gets a new database written. it couldn't hurt to ask the devs about it and get an official response one way or the other.also, stations can't be destroyed, what would stop 0.0 space from becoming littered with outposts into the future?"
3/17/2010,i too would like to see this happen since the change of the sov system.this might also make it more attractive for attacking parties to go after certain systems which ends up within the risk/reward balance. dropping 3 stations in one system (per example) will make it easier for your alliance however it also makes it a prime target for your enemy.what i'd also like to see in time is more customization of stations. for example having several stations of the same faction with a few changes across the board and different 3d models for each. also what i'd like to see is that when a station has been upgraded that the materials don't mysteriously vanish into the station but make physical changes (yes modular stations).
3/17/2010,"what prevents that happening right now ? is there that big difference from the 'littered with outposts' perspective if there is 1, 2 or 3 stations in system. you can already put one station in every system you own. as far as i'm aware most big alliances have plans to do that in fact. put one station in every single system they claim sov in. in my opinion main preventing factor is cost - after you have 2 to 4 stations in system why would you want more ? the population density a 0.0 system can support is finite, as resources in the system are finite. there is only so many people you can stick inside anomaly before you run into dimishing returns. so at some point you have to ask if you would want one more station or would for example one more supercarrier or titan serve you better. second quite relevant reason to ask for lifting of this constraint is in fact the inability to remove stations. i would like to be able to remove stations, even if it would take months and considerable effort and cost. currently, if some dumb person has built caldari station (it's deathtrap btw, kickout style) in strategically important location you are stuck with it. if the constraint is lifted you can just ignore the crap that previous owners of the space have installed and do that properly. make sure that your station undock point is in line with moon where you can dump death star and all the small things that count. i would be asking for option to remove stations from your space also, but it has been already asked many times and devs have stated that they cant or do not want to do that."
3/17/2010,"if it can be combined with a change to sovereignty mechanics to minimize the prevalence of moarblob > all so that warfare actually becomes ""good fights"" and fun for everyone.without such a change adding stations will just act as golden parachutes for ""kickers-of-sandcastles"" or whomever else is the first to make a 1k fleet.war is good and can be fun, but if mechanics keep being tilted towards kicking the castles over building them, the game loses value/attraction.ever since bob ran over ascn all of 0.0 has been engaged in a perpetual escalation leaving no room for the builders .. this is the direct reason for the capital/super-capital spam and to a lesser degree the blobbing we are seeing today.equal opportunity. allow building to hold as much value as destroying."
3/17/2010,"this has already happened. look at delve, providence, deklein, feythabolis, tribute..."
3/17/2010,"could you explain why this is needed?the only reason i can see is ""easier logistics between different outpost types"" or ""we want to have more than one outpost type without the increased sov costs"".for the logistic part i would answer ""more targets on the logistic routes, which is good"".for the 2nd part ... i would answer ""you want variations? pay the costs""so why do you want it?"
3/17/2010,"immersion, empire building, industrial might ... reasons to ask for it are many. and having station in system does nothing to sov cost currently btw. ihub upgrades determine the sov cost - if you use the system you will have them and you pay for them. system without ihub upgrades on the other hand is relatively worthless as it has only rare complex or anomaly and belt ratting is history after one can do it in l5 military upgraded system. i have noticed that people for some reason seem to think that building a station in system makes the sov cost go up. it does not. logistics routes. dunno - perhaps in those alliances space that lack proper organization. in my part of space we do not use gates in non combat ships. there is this thing called jump bridge. goes from one death star pos to another death star pos up to 5 ly away. and proper intel channels also ofc. one must be taking unreasonable risks if he manages to get killed in non combat ship in properly organized alliance space. and building second station in same system would be paying the cost. about 22 - 25 bil or so in fact, depending how deep you live and thus how big is your transportation cost for the egg + contents."
3/17/2010,i support this idea
3/17/2010,well most people upgrade their station systems. and iirc jump bridges are sov index 4 and cost quite a bit. so either you are lying with the upgades or you use gates. ;)
3/17/2010,"maybe its downt to the fact that not every low sec and empire system has a station, whereas in 0.0 you can build a station in every system if you so wish, maybe thats the compromise. tbh do i support it yes and no, but there isnt many stations being built anyway so the impact of allowing multiples in a system i dont seem would be large. so i guess ill support it..but i think it should be limited to say no more than 2"
3/17/2010,only reason i can think is ccp wants to spread the player base out so forcing one per 00 system ( perhaps the alliances should work to making every sytem in 00 have an outpost and then see what ccp does)
3/17/2010,"im not one for the roleplay side but in eve we are all wealthy and our alliances are sometimes ever bigger then the empire alliances...why cant we show our power by having multiple stations if we are to show off our welth i see this as a good way to go about it...perhaps make the stations destructable if theres more then 1 station in the system... tho i see no reason against having a ""capture station/destroy station"" button.... would be a good idea i think.and the owners should have a self destruct button to stop hostile take over of their stations... tho the reason for having the indestructable stations is probably to stop the loss of assets... a simple disclaimer should solve that.and ofcourse the industrial benifits are great..."
3/17/2010,"what elements of the ui do you dislike? the only point of discomfort i have with industry takes place when dealing with the inevitably large amount of bpos and bpcs that accumulate. i would like the selection of which physical copy removed, and replaced with the a clean sort by type.what stops someone from building a battleship in any station they want to already? it would be a tall order to do that on clone jumps, considering you have to wait a day between those jumps. you could get more done faster by making and then distributing bpcs, which is done anyway since copying jobs get their own lab slots, and it is more secure, bringing us back to my first point that reasonable players already eliminate risk of theft with their gameplay.you also assume an abundance of minerals and free factory slots in all those locations, if the material for a galaxy spanning armada is already in place why do you believe that it wouldn't be just as easy to setup the blueprints for those factories to churn out ships into the distant future? and even so, there are plenty of opportunities to get those ships destroyed which is where most of the fun in this game happens anyway. is this genuinely something you think would happen, but is kept in check by messy blueprint hangars?"
3/17/2010,"then you already have it, kind of. switch to list view, use filters... not that your imaginary ""server"" would look any different, knowing ccp.if by ""clean sort by type"" you mean distinguishing bpo's from bpc's, it is desired by literally everybody, and as such, discussed a zillion times in last years. ccp said they would like to have that too, but were pretty adamant it is impossible due to technical reasons. search before posting. devising some imaginary ""servers"" is irrelevant here, as it not help by any means, problem is underlying.same goes for presenting list of bpc details.so, getting stripped of ui issues, we are left with pure desire to save bpo's from hauling dangers.no."
3/17/2010,"not supported, seems like you'd just make blueprints and being limited to a single installation less likely so long as one obtained the proper minerals/materials, and research would then not require the bpo be moved.i'd support a bpo organization system or db that can be located at any station you can place bp's so i don't have to scroll through them all in my inventory but rather have a different bp database i put them into(think special bp hangar). they could be removed from that db/hangar for me/te/pe or copying and transport but in general you'd store them there for ease of use. use would still require the bp be at the facility you want to use it would just be a way to not have hundreds of bp's sitting in your items hangar to dig through, with a better bp interface showing me/te/runs/copy/original etc."
3/17/2010,yes please! /supporting
3/17/2010,self-destruct timers are based on ship class according to the following:capital: 5 minutesbattleship: 3 minutesbattle cruisers: 2 minutescruisers: 1 minutefrigate/destroyer: 30 secondsself-destructing issues a loss mail to the pilot that was in the ship and issues a kill mail to the non-npc pilot that did the highest damage to said ship if it was being agressed.big things make nice boom when self-destructing:when you self-destruct in a battleship or larger ship a wave of damage like a smart bomb goes of inflicting damage to everything within its blast range. any security hits from such a blast are applied.- battleship blast is equivalent to its racial t2 large smart bomb in range and damage. i.e. megathron self-destructing would cause 300 thermal damage to everything within 6km.- pirate issued battleships that require two races to be able to pilot would cause a blast from each race's version of a t2 large smartbomb. i.e. vindicator self-destructing would cause 300 thermal and 300 explosive damage to everything within 6km.- all non-super capitals would do double the damage and double the range of a t2 large smart bomb from its race. i.e. moros self-destructing would cause 600 thermal damage to everything within 12km.- all super capitals would do quadruple the damage and quadruple the range of a t2 large smart bomb from its race. i.e. erebus self-destructing would cause 1200 thermal damage to everything within 24km.- all other ships do not have any damage done to its surroundings when self-destructing.- no smart bomb effect upon self-destuct if within 5km of a station or gate.
3/17/2010,not supported!:p incomplete ;)
3/17/2010,updated op and supporting my proposal.
3/17/2010,"curious regarding the 'missing' parts here?seems fairly 'specific' and has a cover all clause.support it, even more so if ccp can introduce it in some stealthy patching way with no notes ;-)prepare for ramming speed@!!"
3/17/2010,"i was about to make a comment about aoe in empire, however the only ship class with aoe damage is a bs and it's only 1 smartbomb's worth of damage. added with the timer and it is very unlikely able to be abused. however, in the case that an aoe destruct affects a neutral party in empire, the sec loss should be applied as if a smartbomb hit.also, all mods and cargo should still die- self destructing is also a valid tactic to prevent those mods from ending up in enemy hands.otherwise, supported."
3/17/2010,i can see it now...a horde of battleships sd'ing in jita.not supporting until its improved and completed. : o p
3/17/2010,he is talking about when i first made post hours ago and it posted without any info.
3/17/2010,if you would know the history of the original posting. hint .... look at the time of my posting and the time of the last edit. the original posting was broken.;)
3/17/2010,part 1: i dont care so much about the timers. if something selfdestructs before you get the killmail. move on try to get the next one.part 2:ok. i self destruct my raven outside jita 4-4. a hauler undocks and gets killed by your proposed explosion?a) do i get gcc?b) does the pilot get kill rights?and yes you are not the first person with that suggestion.last but not least ... 2 proposals merged into 1 are bad.
3/17/2010,updated op with this in mind. sound better?
3/17/2010,"if they pop something in empire, they have to get gcc. and you can't pop a hauler with only 300 damage. it'll likely pop a tackler or frigate though. honestly, when things blow up they should be damaging stuff near them anyway or they really aren't blowing up, are they?"
3/17/2010,"a) yesb) yesi guess i could have split them but i didn't want to spam assembly hall with related proposals. it is more of a revision of self-destruct feature. to make it based on ship size, issuing a killmail and to make self-destructing be a possible tactic. i don't see an issue with that being in one proposal. edit: timers too long or what? be specific."
3/17/2010,i dont care about them at all. :)as you said in one of the other threads yourself. if you didnt get the killmail move on stop crying. :)so it was somewhat funny to see you bringing up the proposal. :)
3/17/2010,add stargates to that and you'll get my vote.but such requirements would take the fun out of the mechanic elsewhere... which removes the whole reason for it to begin with.
3/17/2010,"""you can not selfdestruct as you are too close to the station/stargate."" similar to the smartbomb warning ;dthinking about it .... that could be amusing with station huggers. ;)but it would require that redock timer and self destruction timer are the same length so you cant dock up faster than self destructing. hmhm. so what about the thought to give both the same timer?"
3/17/2010,"i remember my stance on that. then i got to thinking about the explosion thing and also the fact that they will simply create a kill mail anyways. they still don't get the loot but this gives self destructing some sort of last f-you to the person doing it. maybe the damage needs to be increased to make it worth doing? also, most people complain about capitals self-destructing in two mintues. my proposal would increase this to 5 mintues.this is true. 300 damage from one damage type really going to be an issue outside of jita 4-4? would a pod even die to that? also if it is multiple people doing it at the same time, they would all take massive sec hits and if what ccp has done with insurance on sisi makes it to tranquility we will see a decline in no-risk suicide stuff in empire.on another note, that station should be modified with 3 more exits and when you undock you come out a random one. ""you can not selfdestruct as you are too close to the station/stargate."" similar to the smartbomb warning ;dthinking about it .... that could be amusing with station huggers. ;)or you can not dock if your trying to self-destruct.""you want to bring that ticking time bomb in here?! hell no!"" -scotty"
3/17/2010,"no. atm the docking timer is around 1minute. so you normally wouldnt self destruct on a station/gate but sit out the timer and jump.if you give both timers the same length, you can choose between self destruct and dock/jump."
3/17/2010,"can't support it. battleships should be 2 minutes (the current amount of time given to sd) and everything below decreasing in time. you're trying to ""fix"" something that isn't the problem. so battleships are being punished for what capital ships are causing. if everything from battleships and below were given 2 minutes or less then you'd have my support.but the whines on self destruct are almost always about capitals. so keep the solution tied to that."
3/17/2010,"while i agree about the capital ships self-destructing whines dominating any complaint about the mechanic, it is only because a capital ship doing that is what stings the most to the attackers. it should be scaled according to the ship class don't you think?"
3/17/2010,i'm torn tbh....i like the idea of causing damage while giving the finger in a sd as far as a tactic... but it can be easily abused to hell and back...and if you put too many safeties in place to prevent abuse... it nerfs the hell out of it... thereby removing the reason all-together.while i oppose griefing in high sec (suicide ganking) i do not wish to see that niche go away completely.interesting conundrum to be sure.
3/17/2010,"idea needs more input. wish more people would voice thier idea/opinion about this. also, wouldn't someone just fit rack of smartbombs to be more effective than the one effective smartbomb by self-destruct?"
3/17/2010,"oh i'm with ya. your idea is noble. but the consequences are too harsh for battleships. again, i don't feel that battleships are the problem. and i want them to have a decent chance to sd. a battleship having to go through 3 minutes to sd is pushing it too much since they're usually ganked anyway. i just think it needs to be reasonable. and 3 minutes is too much time for a bs."
3/17/2010,and give the satisfaction of punishment to concord? :)
3/17/2010,"i find myself agreeing with matrix here.which is odd for me, to say the least."
3/17/2010,why should the 3minute timer for bs be a problem? finally enough time to nibble away the ratter in a rifter!;)
3/17/2010,i'd like to see a change for sure. if anything make the ability to generate a km from a sd even if no loot drops.
3/17/2010,"this is true, so how about 2 min for a bs and 1.5 min for a bc?also, should smaller ships than a bs set off an explosion? all??damage or range be increased on what i put in the op?johnny 5 needs input, input!"
3/17/2010,"oh i'm sure it would make for some lulz moments. but that isn't a justified reason for changing a game mechanic, as much as the lullerz kiddies think otherwise.edit: supported"
3/17/2010,"it would be a really good idea if it was a dot-aoe. so, not only popping ships, but also pods. the reason being, doing it would be both an f-u and would decimate sec status if done as a suicide gank. so, something like 100-300 damage/sec for 6 seconds. making it so there was no control over keeping it from popping pods would prevent people from using it as a high sec gank (popping pods is a pretty big sec hit), while creating a good middle finger to an attacker."
3/17/2010,"ok i give it +1.btw: that will give nice wtf moments for mom pilots warping to close to a gate or getting bumped towards the gate. ;)""you can not self destruct as you are only 22km from the gate"";)"
3/17/2010,"dont get trolled csm by this failposter.op knows hes wrong now hes just trying to cover it up with an ""ill get the last word in"" so i dont look like a tool. however we are well past that now. op fail."
3/17/2010,"op's got it spot on, loot tables for mag sites may need looked at but honestly they need looked at anyway.the only possible reason for the invention interface being so bad is that it was designed by a sadist who enjoys torturing mice."
3/17/2010,"current situation is that:1)current game mecanic does not take into account the fact that radial tolerance increases as an object approaches the gun, reaching 180% tolerance when an object is at point blank. rl example: if i am standing 10cm from a freight train and holding a gun, no matter how fast the train moves, i will probably hit it. second issue is that when firing in falloff, it is equally hard to hit a titan and a frigate.rl example: if i am firing withought aiming, i will have easier time hitting a tank then a fly. solution #1: a mild adjustmentto the formulas- this is not perfectly accurate, but is a compromice between rl and game mecanics complexety, implementing 99% realistic romulas would require reworking the entire targeting and tracking system, which would be alot of work that does not really make a difference, therefore, lets:1) when distance to the target is less then 10x it's signature radius, the sig. radius used for tracking calculation is increased as target gets closer (to the person trying to shoot it ofc.) and reaches 2-3x target's normalsig. radius at point blank. the increase is exponential. therefore when a bs is orbiting a bs at distance < 4km (assuming sig. radius of most battleships is 400m), it will need more transversal to speedtank the other bs. however, if we have a frigate orbiting a bs, nothing will change as frigate's sig. radius is 50-60 meters, and orbiting closer then 500 meters at full speed is not very common. 2) propose the formula: real falloff = target sig. resolution/gun sig. resolution * gun's natural faloff, where target sig res/gun sig res cannot go any higher then 3, and can't go any lower then 1/3.this will result in: bs with projectiles/blasters being able to hit towers with moderate efficiency.large increase of engagement range or blaster and projectile armed ships against larger targets. decrease of ingagement range of large ships against smaller ships. puts blaster users into a less ******ed position in regards to tracking when at point blank (which is where they belong)increases importance of target painters. your thoughts on the system proposed?"
3/17/2010,"ok i do like this idear,but it has been mentioned 1000s of times and as yet ccp have brushed it off,and for the record salvaging is not a profession, is an aspect of expleration (magnometric sites) still hopfully ccp sees this thred and thinks""its bouut time the destroyer class ships got some new uses and varents"" im not crossing my fingers yet thoughdd"
3/17/2010,60-100m would seem apprirprate could have 40km tractor range and perhaps a 50% base salvage chance or standard salvager but a 10km radius fo salvage
3/17/2010,better not tell that to the ninja salvage crowd.. they may start following you around.
3/17/2010,"strongly supportthe point of training all those skills is to give yourself more options. and yet a brand new player has the option of cheap easily replaceable losses (that's a pretty damn good option) yet players like me who have to pay 20-30 mil that's a long ago dream.a thing i love about eve is being able to do everything on one character not having to create a second character to train up a 2nd class. alts in eve are for teamwork or doing 2 specialisations at once not cause your main character is limited. the only way for me to viably fly a large selection of ships is to train up a alt to do it, for some ships their advantage is cheap cost which is directly countered by my clone."
3/17/2010,only at 72m sp but the bare clone (ie. no implants) cost already equates to two fully fitted and insured bcs or a t2 frigate.anything to make dying less painful gets my vote.addendum: alternative is to have just few sp tiers and then add costs dependent on intended use (a clone with ability to contain full +4 sets being more expensive than a +2 capable one - higher grade clones = more expensive).
3/17/2010,*slaps the opno one should be totally immune from danger not even in hi sec. risk is what makes this game not suck
3/17/2010,no...
3/17/2010,"i support ^that, let a corp pay a fee equal to the cost of declaring war on a corporation, should a corporation attempt to war dec that corp the corp being war decd gets the option of paying a fee to 'undec' themselves and it can go ping pong back increasing exponentially or maybe just doubling every time it gets smacked back and forth. perhaps a skillset could be added to control the number of times the wardec hot potato could be lobbed back and forth or the number of 'counters' a protected corporation could try in order to dodge the war dec. a ceo also might train government bureaucracies and each level allows them to increase the odds(5% chance to start for a max of 25%) of having their counter offer get concord to drop the war dec which can then be started over again with all fees reset. wardecs can still happen but it isn't as easy as 'oh look at those miners, click-payfee-wait 24hrs for war'."
3/17/2010,curved warp flights would be the solution.

3/17/2010,"just because almost all this ship's are flying in gay setup (covert cloak), i think they must be scannable."
3/17/2010,scanning became way too easy with apocrypha anyway.btw how come your ship's signal strength inside a deadspace complex with tenn of structures and ships is greater then the signal strenght of this comlex?ship's signal strength should be capped at complex's signal strength when you're inside imo

3/17/2010,your not a very bright miner are you? considering the trash you keep spewing.stop embarrassing us and walk away before you embarrass yourself.
3/17/2010,mission runners had to deal with a 11% tax while in a npc corp so why shouldn't miners deal with a 11% reduction in mining yield while in a npc corp?
3/17/2010,hint: many of the mission runners are not in npc corps anymore. they are in hundreds of new 1-man-corps. other mission farmers have multiple corps to jump wardecs over and over again. (hint fly to palas and see all the toons in the corps with the funny numbers as corp ticker) and same goes for macro miners. so your suggestion would not really solve that problem at all.
3/17/2010,i am well aware that many mission runners are no longer in npc corps. this is self evident pretty much wherever you go in the eve universe.my suggestion wasnt actually to solve the problem. my suggestion would make npc miners to be tempted to move to player corporations to maximize their yield; they would then be subject to war decs. this wouldnt stop the miners from jumping corp. but similarly this wouldnt stop anyone from war decing any corporation they jumped to. this is similar to the one man player mission running corporations you refer to. they are subject to war declarations as you well know.
3/17/2010,tax wouldn't stop mining in npc corps even then.just like it never stopped mission runners... in spite of the 1 man mission corps... and furthermore... the same applies to miners in 1 man mission corps as well.so basically.... complete and utter waste of time.
3/17/2010,i agree with you it wouldnt stop npc mining. in fact i wouldnt want to stop npc mining at all. the 11% reduction to mining yield as mentioned earlier would make miners whether macro or not tempted to move to a player corporation where they are subject to war declarations.do you feel this would really be a complete waste of time?
3/17/2010,sure. i let my npc miner alt mine the stuff and reprocess it with my player corp toon that even got some standing from mission running. or if i dont have an alt i ask my mission running friend in his 1 man corp.
3/17/2010,your mining alt currently isn't mining at a 11% reduction to mining yield. i wasn't refering to reprocessing/refining. i am refering to a 11% reduction to mining yield.
3/17/2010,all your doing is making the problem worse.if i was a solo miner... i would make a solo corp.... mine...if i get war dec'd... i leave and go npc for a bit leaving an alt behind to spite them.... or jump to an another solo corp.... etc...etc...hence... total and utter waste of time.even then... i likely wouldn't give a damn about 11% tax on refinement anyway as my skills would make up for it... and if it gets that bad.... i'll go to whs where i can refine my own damn minerals at a 25% loss and still come out on top.getting the message yet?
3/17/2010,just to be clear i am refering to a 11% reduction to mining yield.
3/17/2010,doesn't matter even then... just means it takes longer to get to the same result... but not much longer.
3/17/2010,thats cool. i'm not trying to stop mining. it takes longer to get the same result if you are a mission runner in an npc corporation but not much longer. why should npc miners be exempt?
3/17/2010,supporting this and bump
3/17/2010,/sign and /support from me and my associates as well as bump it
3/17/2010,many pilots run with minimum settings (including texture detail) when in situations where graphics lag could be an issue. i doubt minimum detail textures are as significant. thus this is probably a non issue.*but* i digress it is not for the players to decide what is feasible. all we need to do is tell ccp what features we want and *they* determine weather they are feasible.would you like to see this feature implemented?
3/17/2010,destroyers are such a nothing ship. i remember when they were released. people flew them for about a week and worked out they sucked balls. unfortunately the t2 variant (although it has a role) is still kind of munted in terms of usefulness as one good hit from a cruiser will kill it.
3/17/2010,"actually if you can just gain access to the can rather than it showing you the password would be cool. exploding cans would be funny too. while you set the password you select boobytrap to arm container, lol."
3/17/2010,"honestly.i haven't met a single person who has used t2 rigs on the ships they actually fly in-game.i'm betting some rich l4 mission runners stick them on their vargs' and golems', but other than that..."
3/17/2010,"much discussion has gone on about insurance and suicide ganking. i throw this idea out to the crowd.allow people to bribe concord. hulk pilot pays x isk for concord to keep a small ship nearby. suicide gankers can see said ship. game result is a faster concord response time. this is a form of insurance that is more in line with the flavor of the game and allows those concerned with suicide ganks to pay more for security, if they want. the faster response time would make it harder to suicide gank, but ideally not impossible for a coordinated team. it would dovetail with the existing variable response times in different security systems. the bribe might be system specific or constellation specific. if concord is too ""pure"" allow the bribing of the local racial cops. perhaps put a new trade good in the game, donuts...it could also be considered that criminals could bribe concord as well, to give them a bit more time. both options act as an isk sink and keeps some kind of risk in high sec."
3/17/2010,"i see 2 solutions on that.first of all this is a brilliant idea. as pirating in systems of high sec is not part of the game nor intended to work, this issue needs to be solved. gankers should have not a single chance to proceed their plans.i see the idea with the personal concorde bodyguard. but it it still has vulnerabilities left to be used for exploiting.1. solution: i recommend not to make it with a concorde vessel. the better way would be to use a skill for it. this skill should have the background to use static concorde turrets, in e.g. 1 per level of skill. those could have a range of like 500 kms and only react on high sec pirates (players) that attack a player. though still the chance is kept that a player lets fool himself by the old and still working faction trick.2. solution: instead of guns the use of concorde drones. i am not sure if this should be skill depending.of course, the lower the sec status of a system is, the slower the concorde comes. this factor can also be involved into both solutions by increasing the response time of the ship. i just dont see the point. suicide gankers are cheaters. they use a weakness in the game engine to gain personal benefit. this is what i call an exploit. they attack, they die. i would not discuss, since none of them is a paying customer, but a trial account. the pirate behind this tactic might be a paying character. but if this way a game-engine can be optimized, it is ok.ikoniathe greater northern alliance"
3/17/2010,"that's funny, the devs seem to think otherwise."
3/17/2010,"although i don't think pvp is the main driving force behind the economy. i think it's going a little too far to say ""pvp'ers don't do squat to keep the economy going"". come on now fille balle, pvp does have a noticeable impact on the economy. thinking about it more i and am switching positions a little. pvp is a driving force behind the economy. i don't think it's as big a driving force as pve but it's still a large driving force."
3/17/2010,"if not for item destruction, there would be no market for your loot, lp etc. item destruction results from pvp. qed. i'm not saying it's more important in case i stepped on someone's ego there just that it is the 'end consumer' in a production chain and the demand that sets many a price. it would be like me saying that eve would be better off without carebears - because the dependency works both ways."
3/17/2010,"sokratesz said if not for item destruction, there would be no market for your loot, lp etc. item destruction results from pvp.i was under the impression there was a lot more item destruction from pve then pvp. i thought but i could be wrong that the highest lost ships tend to be pve ships like ravens which you dont get in pvp much. either way like i said, once i thought about it more i think pvp is a large driving force and my first post saying pvp is not a driveing force is wrong."
3/17/2010,i'd like to see the number of ships destroyed by npc's vs. the number of ships destroyed with a player on the mail. i'm fairly certain that that ratio would be something outrageous like 1:10000.(hint hint ccp quarterly newsletter)
3/17/2010,well said. this is exactly the issue here. the nature of 'kill' missions needs to be completely revisited. wave after wave of big'n'dumb rats whos difficulty is rated solely on dps and tank... no.give pvers a chance!
3/17/2010,"yeah, you're absolutely right. that's taking it too far, but on the other hand, saying that pvp is the sole driving force behind the economy is taking it too far in the opposite direction. in fact, pvp isn't fueling anyting at all, it is the fire that burns the fuel produced by mission runners/miners/industrialists etc.sure, no fire, no practical use for the fuel. but my point still stands. if pvp was such a great way of burning fuel, then why has the price of minerals dropped to a point where it's profitable to sd a ship? i think part of the reason is that 99% of eve's players are carebears.the only players that actually loose ships are either noobs or 0.0 soldiers. any experienced player will know how to avoid loosing his ship, even the pvp'er. and they will all do everything they can in order to avoid loosing ships. besides, an average mission runner or 0.0 soldier fly's a battleship or better, where as an average pvp'er will usually fly a cruiser or a bc. so when a mission runner/0.0 soldier looses a ship, far more minerals are ""burned"".this is what i mean when i say pvp'ers don't do squat. yes, you're right, it makes a difference, but not enough unfortunately."
3/17/2010,"people die in pve? i mean seriously, ok maybe you lose a few ships learning the ropes/different missions and maybe the odd one when you forget to turn your tank on but otherwise: how do you die in pve, *especially* if that's what you do full time? as a former mission runner, i would need that explained to me lol.the reason the raven dies so frequently is twofold. one, it's extremely popular compared to other bs so when people attack pvers they're more likely to be hitting a raven pilot. two, one of the reasons it's so popular is its versatility which includes its pvp role as the best torpedo ship in the game, so there's intentional pvp losses on top of ganks. aside from ammunition, which is a consumable item, pve does little to drive the economy unless there's pvp in the picture. without pvp loss, players will stop buying ships. you'll have the case where players skill up, buy one of whatever they need at each level, and then they'll hardly need to make another purchase. eve's growth rate simply cant sustain that kind of economic model.now when you factor in replacements needed for victims and doers of suicide ganking, 0.0 pvp (including the cap-loss-heavy sov conflicts), lowsec piracy, at-risk pveing (like in lowsec or 0.0 where the barrier to attack by players is low), highsec wars, and carebears buying ships they can go out and pvp for fun in, then you have what drives our economy."
3/17/2010,"alekseyev karrde said ""people die in pve?""yes as there is far more to pve then just missions. complex's and wormhole space sleepers kill a fair few pilots. cosmos and expeditions kill a lot. i bet a lot die in level 5 missions. then there are those that seem to somehow die in level 4 and less missions. i know some of the static cosmos sites i lived in used to kill a lot of pilots per day every day. unlike the odd pvp battle here and there those cosmos sites are every day.that and as pve people outnumber pvp people by so much even if only a small amount of pve people die that's still a massive amount compared to pvp.i really don't believe your comments on pvp are correct as ccp did give us pvp loss numbers and they were very tiny. but only ccp has the stats to prove one of us right or wrong. perhaps the pve numbers are also very small."
3/18/2010,"yep. lets nerf all successful ships: drake, myrm, ishkur, ishtar, zealot, rupture etc. lets fix old problems: nerf scorch range, increase auto cannon pg, boost rails, remove projectile alfa etc. lets make everything equal!"
3/18/2010,"and it's opinions like this that keep you on the losing side of most fights. i've never said don't boost rails, i've just strongly argued that it shouldn't be a boost in damage specifically. it doesn't matter what they do to any gun, there's always going to be a preferred ship class in fleets, a secondary and a third. someone has to be third always."
3/18/2010,"no it won't, do the math right, the 401 dps hyp comes to 461 dps after the suggested boost, 60 dps for 30+ km range lost to the apoc, which is actually a perfect trade. 15% damage gained for a 15% loss to range, plus low alpha and cap issues on it's major platform flavor of the month this is not.propose an alternative then, you haven't brought any new information that would suggest that things are either balanced currently or that the proposed changes would be imbalanced, if you don't like the proposed changes anyways at least offer an alternative instead of simply demanding that the game remain unbalanced.next you're going to say that range equates a damage boost aren't you? xd firstly you demonstrated yourself why this is wholly insufficient, 4th mag stab gives you 6% damage when we're looking at a need for 15%, secondly not everyone will have low slots available for this as rigs are a fairly common alternative for squeezing more pg out of a fit if needed lastly rails fit fairly well to their platform as is, i can't think of a rail platform that would particularly want to use an rcu unless they're also fitting 1600mm plates & mwd.prove it, you haven't introduced any new information, we've produced numerous fits with tachyons and decent ehp and mwds on apocs before, honestly if nobody can compare anything to tachyons then the only solution is to remove tachyons from the game since they're either designed to be op, or appropriate and should be compared with other top tier sniper weapons.propose an alternative or gtfo"
3/18/2010,"actually, i believe the calculation would be:243 (the dps without the mag modifier)*1.1 (10% increase)*401/243 (the increase provided by the mags)=441.1 dpsthis would make it a powerful ship (even though the cap wouldn't last). but it has already been pointed out that you can get an abaddon, similarly fit, doing 502 dps that would be doing more dps than the beefed up hype until about 180km. also can get a maelstrom over 400 dps with all the massive alpha as well. 441.1 dps on a hyperion isn't over-powered unless you are flying a rokh."
3/18/2010,4 mag stab hype is 425 dps. op says 15% increase in dmg. 1.15*425 = 488.75. with 3 mag stabs it's 461. why would someone do a 4 stab hype? i think 490 dps at 210 optimal is reason enough.
3/18/2010,"please do the calculation again. the damage boost is to the guns themselves. if 4 mag stabs make 425 dps, then a 15% boost to guns would bring it to 488.75. still less than a 502 dps abaddon. 3 mag stabs (as your fit showed) would be 441.1 dps (as i showed in the calculation). still less than the 502 dps abaddon up to 174km.are you in favor of nerfing beams so the abaddon and apoc don't trounce railguns? wait, then projectiles would be op and have to be nerfed to match the other weapons. or, they could boost railguns to match everything else."
3/18/2010,"you want to talk about a 4 mag stab hype then we'll talk about 4 heat sink apocs and abbadons and how they're absolutely rediculous, 425 dps@231km optimal on an apoc and 532dps@175km optimal, are either of them practical? not really, but hey 4 damage mods must still be a good and sensible thing.i think we're assuming different boosts here, you're thinking of a 10% boost and we're thinking of a 15%, either way neither of the results are overpowered in any way as the worst case scenario is my proposal with the 15% boost where you trade range for damage perfectly equally between the hype and an apoc."
3/18/2010,"so, glass canon + frentix is your answer to balance issues? is that a valid argument? i believe not. is it a strawman argument? no, but it is naive or very biased, trying to force the argument. a properly fit hype does 357 dps @ 191+48 km (less than an apoc at the same range) and tanks 68k ehp. a 15% damage increase would take that only up to 410 dps. so yaay, you can now stop using failfits to try to argue that rails will be op if boosted. if you have trouble fitting a fleetbs, it's ok, pay attention, you might learn something.however, if you are one of those people that show up in fleet battles in expensive non-reimbursable ships that can't be repped before they get popped, be my guest. darwin will take care of your affliction."
3/18/2010,"on the contrary, despite talking about glass cannon fits, yaay seems to use more cautious fits. such as this apoc with only 1 heat sink, or this 2 sink sniper apoc, or the 2 sink sniper harby, or this super-plate abaddon.so, i guess i have even more trouble with yaay pointing to glass cannons with fear while flying normal or tank fits. why don't you fly with 4 heat sinks? the same reason almost no one uses such a fit on a hyperion."
3/18/2010,"funny part is that the glass cannon approach ends up favoring the apoc pretty well as it can sit signifigantly further out while doing very nice damage allowing it to get away with lower ehp numbers since the only thing hitting it will be a rokh and they only really tickle. setting up a 401 dps@231km with 48k ehp apoc is fairly easy, and with implants and a faction te you can bring that dps to 425, that is a glass cannon, or a cannon at least since 48k ehp isn't super-squishy in the end."
3/18/2010,"you're an idiot for comparing pulses to anything long range.i'm using the same argument against people that have argued the other side. i showed stats with both 3 and 4 mag stabs for that reason. comparing any abanddon fit to any other sniper fit is just idiocy. yes it get's ridiculous firepower. it also caps out in about 12 shots. that's not even comparable to other races that can get about 60 shots off before capping out in the most ideal situation.with or without frentix, the range difference is about 17 - 20 optimal. that's not a lot, and again, it has nothing to do with damage issues. you guys keep ignoring the point and trying to just discredit me in general. point is, there are far better things to balance rails with than damage. you guys keep arguing about every stat but damage at this point because you can't win the argument, the hype does nice damage and it fubarred your arguement because you didn't know it could do that at those ranges.it's the difference between wind bagging an argument, and actually doing all the proper analysis first. i don't like your idea because in the history of eve, it has never worked, and it's been tried many times.i think making fittings easier, and some small tweaks to secondary stats make far more sense for rails.i don't use glass cannon fleets because they're impossible to use these days. 7-10 bombs kill even the avg tanked snipe fleets, a few bubbles and a rr fleet tears them to peaces too. there's virtually no use for a snipe fleet in game. that's not an issue with rails, that's an issue with fleet warfare in general.if some of you still use snipe fleets, good luck. but when you face a competent force, you're going to die in a hurry."
3/18/2010,"except, this is an tach sniper fit that you lost. 312 dps @ 200km + 37 falloff and 80k ehp. from a time when fear of dd was greater than doing more dps.i wasn't laying into you yaay. i was pointing out that you fit tanks, not glass cannons (as had been suggested). also pointing out that few people (you are an example) fly glass cannon snipers (with 4x damage mods).the 502 dps fit caps out after 5+ minutes, which is more than the 425 dps hype fit (<5 minutes).and again, i agree. there are other things that can be changed other than just boosting dps."

3/18/2010,if what you are saying is popping ratters/miners in a system impacts the system industry/military levels. this is a good idea.edit: support
3/18/2010,"what he is saying is that ratters and miners are now a valid part of the defense strategy for a system, but that they will need to be defended for this to work. and that preventing them from doing their thing will make the system easier to take a little later on. actually popping them has nothing to do with it. it's an incentive for sovereignty holders to man (or woman) up and defend their right to rat and mine rather than dock up or move to a different system. and that should mean more real fights can be had rather than simple ganks -- and that's a good thing."

3/18/2010,"heyoo. it has come to my attention that there are multiple people who have a problem with accidental double-clicks in eve, which cause trouble and distress to players.example 1) you have a helios and it is cloaked in a deadspace site. you rotate the camera to get a new vantage point of your surroundings and about 15 seconds later you are completely decloaked and are being shot at by rats. you lose your helios.example 2) you are at a pos in your thanatos. you close a chat window then need to go afk. about 10-15 minutes later your cell phone is going off. your corpmates are calling you because your thanatos is 120km away from the pos.these are all frustrating incidents which can increase the potential for losses due to poor mouse click implementation. so let's fix it.proposali propose that we implement a ship anchor button. whether it is a button near your reset view/tactical overlay buttons or a right click option in the hud triangle <U+25BA>, it would allow you to anchor your ship in place. alternatively if your ship is not already stopping and is moving, you could have it keep your current direction of movement fixed. so it basically will lock down your ship movements to whatever they are at currently. when you warp the anchor deactivates automatically. if you stop warp before you warp you will need to re-anchor your ship.note: if your ship is stopping and you are decelerating from say, 200m/s and you hit your anchor, it would prevent you from moving once you land in place. if you are aligned to say a star and hit the anchor button it would make it so your ship may not divert from its current alignment to the star. i feel the urge to state this does not negatively impact other people attempting to bump you. if somebody bumps you will still move, you just will not be able to input new movement commands until you unanchor your ship.tl;dr: implement an anchor button that prevents the client from new movement commands (except warp.)this is frustrating to many players and has been noted in this thread:"
3/18/2010,approving my own post :d
3/18/2010,"so if you're stopped dead and anchored, what effect does bumping have? would it be the regular stopped + bumping effect, or would it be more like the approach + bumping effect?"
3/18/2010,this thread has been made under the pretence that double-clicking is an issue.it isn't.
3/18/2010,then please explain to me why when rotating the camera i will start moving in the direction which i first single clicked to grab the camera?
3/18/2010,"happens to me too, but not supporting because this isn't the solution."
3/18/2010,then what do you propose? where is the negative impact of this idea?
3/18/2010,supported.
3/18/2010,not supported.people should take care of their ship. it isnt all that difficult.
3/18/2010,"you're in a car. you park on a hill. you put the car in park and turn on the e-brake like anybody would. you get out of your car. the second you turn around your e-brake fails and your car slips into neutral.your car goes careening down the hill, and crashes into another person's car. now, you did everything right. the car had some sort of malfunction you weren't expecting though. who is at fault? you, or the car?"

3/18/2010,"i don't think you understand the problem.in eve, accidental mouse clicks are detected. sure i can tell my ship to stop, tell it to orbit, tell it to stay at range.but as soon as i click my mouse somewhere else, there is a chance my client will send that to the server as a double click and off i go.there is no way to prevent it from happening for some people, so that is why i posted this thread."
3/18/2010,"you have a doubleclicking problem, you propose a toggle-button solution... i sense a new instance of the same problem incoming..."
3/18/2010,"fortunately the problem doesn't work like that.i am not 100% sure what causes it or else i would fix it myself, but it doesn't seem to happen when i click on most ui things that are fixed in place. the only thing it has happened to before is a module (which wound up with it turning yellow.. it was amusing) and any chat box which is stacked on top of other chat boxes.so, regardless of it being a client issue or a server issue, why can't it just be something that we could have as an option?"
3/18/2010,"i used to have an issue with double clicking and ending up with my hulk drifting away without me realizing, so i got a new mouse and problem was solved."
3/18/2010,this problem happen so often to me that i press ctrl+space preemptively when i play with the camera and need to be sure i'm still standing still.there can be multiple solutions thought like changing the shortcut for moving or playing a sound when the ship received this order.
3/18/2010,"i have this problem, have had it for some time. it is massively irritating. after some simple testing i determined that (not surprisingly) it is my mouse at fault, not eve. replace your mouse, see if you still need an anchor. however... the alignment lock aspect of this idea i do like, very much. a starship drifting back to neutral trim is both idiotic in concept and problematic in practice. i'll support this for that reason."
3/18/2010,supporting on the assumption that it can be assigned to a shortcut.
3/18/2010,"not supported, doesn't take much effort to make sure your not moving before you go afk.adapt or die comes into play here"
3/18/2010,yes for an option to disable double-click. we need nothing more.
3/18/2010,"this i would support if it were it's own proposal.the op, on the other hand, gets a no."
3/18/2010,i support the idea of a ship anchor.
3/18/2010,"most likelly your mouse button is suffering from debounce or contact bouncei had this issue too , although my mouse was fine for every other application i run on my machine it did not work well in eve.my guess is eve uses custom drivers for the mouse , and those drivers are not very good at recognising contact bounce.buy a new mouse this will fix your issues long before ccp does."
3/18/2010,this can be fixed by shortening your double click speed so two clicks not meant to be a double click are not reported to the game as a double click.
3/18/2010,"unfortunettly no , if the double click pulse is being sent by a mouse button that is wearing out the pulses will only be milliseconds apart.much faster than can be caught by the double click speed setting."
3/18/2010,then they have a crappy mouse and likely have any number of other problems in other software because of it. eve doesn't need to compensate for that.
3/18/2010,i support ccp fixing the underlying problem instead of adding a band-aid.
3/18/2010,"i agree with these changes - especially the bandwidth boost module (if you remove the bonus drones controlled). the bandwidth has nothing to do with the amount of drones controlled (that's the drones skill that determines number), but only the size of the drones. we may see myrms with a full rack of heavy drones, but they wouldn't have guns.the helios is the most underpowered covops ship due to only having two highs - the 3 drones will help compensate for that. a dedicated droneboat bs could be a new t2 ew bs with a bonus to drone control range and drone ew bonus as the t2 bonuses.supported."
3/18/2010,"a highslot 5mb module with medium fitting req, and 10mb mod with large fitting req would be better, more drones would probably not. the ishkur does not need a buff, 5% more drone damage defenately is a buff.otherwise: supported."
3/18/2010,"making a ""more powerful"" drone boat than the dominix is pushing into the realm of carriers. a fantastic in-between could be taking the concept of the nuet/vamp-domi and giving bonuses and fittings to fit this play-style. but only if ccp can manage to make it an uglier ship than the flying-mutant-potato."
3/18/2010,"not supportedhigh skill characters got tons of advantages over less skilled charactersreducing risk in pvp is the wrong way to gothis game is great precisely because losses mean somethingthose who don't want to pay high clone cost don't have to buy clones, if they want to fly cheap ships, they don't need more than 20 mil sp anyway. ccp should not keep lowering the bar just so more stupid people can pass"
3/18/2010,"i would prefer an older player dying and because of the cost going straight back into battle with a new ship they already have ready to go (which generally carrys a heavier cost than the clone and helps industry) then to just go ohh well can't justify another clone tonight i'll log. because of the fun of fighting you can justify spending more time to get more ships but justifying time for just a clone which doesn't directly relate to fun is a lot harder (imo).its about getting more pvp from a game that is about pvp and making it more attractive to undock in a game where people are already too safe. the clone cost for a loss isn't really that much until you get to the higher levels and it blows out to ridiculous costs. for those who say we want free pvp what about the ship, mods and any implants? this i get to choose at the time what i'm willing to risk. not i need a 75m sp clone because i don't want to see the past x years gone to waste in training and paying for this game. i don't want eve to be risk free its the whole reason why eve gives you such a good buzz when pvping and why its different from so many other games.on that note its a game, not everyone gets to play heaps and its supposed to be fun with a good balance between risk vs reward. its also an rp game and saying i should be forced to use an alt because of my age doesn't work well on me. if ccp stated this was the punishment for being a long paying customer and i should stop training my character then i would stop paying my account for those busy periods in life where i'm not playing much. i'm not sure ccp really like the idea of stopping people from progressing as that in some cases is the only reason why they are still around.also how does being old mean they should be flying expensive ships? i think most that fly expensive ships do it because they are rich and flying anything less doesn't give them that buzz anymore as its too easy for them to replace. this can be for someone quite young though if they got lucky, are good at market stuff or even just have lots of time to make money. being able to only play a few hours a week gives very different perspective than being able to play everyday for a few+ hours.it seems a few here also seem to think anyone taking risks is doing it wrong and i know some people think if its a fair fight your doing it wrong. just because you die doesn't mean your being stupid or even risky sometimes it can mean you were unlucky or need more friends (yeah everyone likes more blobs). don't we want more risky behavior not less?sorry i got a bit rumbly there.also this thread is different to my proposal thread which i gave examples on what i could see it being. this turned out to be a bad idea as everyone thought it was concrete and no one gave suggestions on how to improve it. just proposing a change to make the high end not so expensive at least gives personal interpretation and ccp can do the same if they feel its important enough.can only support the topic once? doesn't this give the replies to support ratio a false indication if there is any discussion?and now i have to wait 5 minutes even though i couldn't post anyway!! arhhh this forum is ****"
3/18/2010,"listened to yourself much?any reason why you feel compeled to always be on the negative side of any and all issues?do you even pvp?i don't grind. i'm not interested in collecting rat tails for the store keeper. i have enough isk. i don't see the reason for clones locking high sp subscribers out of small ships.matting is correct, many times on ts/vent i have heard people say ""oh well can't justify yet another clone tonight, cyas""get over yourself drake, you are not ""all that""."
3/18/2010,seems a reasonable request. want this fixed for when i get to those insance number in 5-6 years
3/18/2010,pathetic.

3/18/2010,"supported.i can't think of a good reason why high skilled players should be restricted from engaging in pvp as easily as everyone else can, due to having to spent so much time working to generate enough income to even afford the clones, as some guys here seem to think they should.that approach is dictating playstyle to others which sucks. if i want to pvp i don't see why i should have to spend 5 times as much time ratting or working on industry to afford it as anyone else."
3/18/2010,"strongly opposed. clone costs are one of the advantages newer players hold over older players. older players are supposed to be able to compensate for higher clone costs with greater player experience and the advantages of better character skills. in any case, the absolute cost of clones is not actually very high.if the op feels that his clone costs are too high, he can always create a new character for low-sp activities.eve is supposed to be a pvp game with a harsh death penalty. clone costs are part of that penalty"

3/18/2010,"if you have ever been involved in flipping a station to conquer a system, you would be against this. unless they release a super weapon to rip apart stations, there should be a limit of 1 station to a system or people will begin putting a dozen stations in a system so it would be near impossible to conquer the system."
3/18/2010,there is always the option of emptying wallets to change sov or disbanding alliances.proven to be a well working way to take over systems and stations.
3/18/2010,lol! too true. metagaming remains the only way to win 0.0 wars in eve - even post-dominion.
3/18/2010,"i have been present in several cases of flipping or trying to flip station system ownership under the new system. 49-u (failed attempt, timezone pingpong), d-g (biggest blob so far, capital turkey shoot), period basis (many station systems without any real opposition). i still consider lifting this ban preventing multiple stations per system reasonable. if ccp is worried about someone dropping 20 stations in system then they can either tweak sov system to take possibility into account or discourage station spam thru other means - for example making number of stations in system affect sov bill."
3/18/2010,"fair enough. i'm just pointing out a major reason why it would be bad to allow multiple stations in a system in response to posts like these:andandas in, spamming stations as a means of defending a system is a big reason why to limit a system to only 1 outpost."
3/18/2010,"if eve history has shown us anything then it is that cost alone does not prevent activities that give edge to one side in the territorial dance. however i'm fairly confident that if number of stations in system would cause exponential system maintenance cost increase after the first station one could station spam himself into bancrupcy. if number of stations would cause increasing of bill then it should be however 'offline' stations to avoid punishing whoever is unfortunate enough to conquer the system. or you can just go easy route and make station hp in system shared. so you build 2 stations, fair enough, but they have their hp halved, etc etc. when making multiple stations cost something. ccp has stated on several occasions that they will not make stations destructible. fair enough - how about offlining them. nothing snappy ofc. let's say 2 week timer to offline and 1 month timer to online a station. offline station would be kinda like normal station just all station services would be disabled and you would not be able to put new items on the hangar floor in there as hangars would 'full'. everyone could dock there as it's offline afterall. saying that there should be only 1 station per system is like saying that there should be hard cap at 5 titans per system. if allowing multiple stations per system would unbalance something then simple - rebalance it. but damnit i want my sandbox!"
3/18/2010,"wft, why the hell would you limit it? let's limit amount of money you can have in your wallet so rich don't get richer huh? same thing here."
3/18/2010,how about this ... eve is risk vs reward. correct?so .... when someone invades your system as soon as *1* outposts becomes vulnerable all other outposts in system become vulnerable too.risk: you loose way more assets when the system is taken. of course it means this system will be a more juicy target for invaders.reward: easier logistics as long as you hold the system.if we make the sov mechanics like that i would say ... drop as many outpost as you want into the system and make the pinata more juicy. ;)would you still want multiple outpost in a single system with this mechanic?
3/18/2010,"there is an artificial limit on how much dps you can bring to bear in a system. whether it is the max dps a ship can do or the maximum number of pilots that you can put in a system before the node chokes, it isn't a whole lot when you compare it to the defenses of stations. again, a dozen stations would probably make a system invincible, as you would likely spend the entire day (downtime-to-downtime) and end up unable to reinforce the last station.that's what i'm getting at."

3/18/2010,"if the defenders can't defend 1 station in a system, how will they defend 2 or more? shooting a station is what happens after the system has been secured.seriously, it's a non issue. if you want to spam stations to make your space a grind to conquer, it's hugely more effective to put 12 stations (and 12 ihubs) in 12 systems than it is to put 12 stations and 1 hub in 1 system."
3/18/2010,you are sure about the station thing?from
3/18/2010,"the reason stations get reinforced without being defended is usually because there isn't enough time for a decent defense fleet to form up, get in position, and attack. as was stated, with enough dreads, it only takes a cycle. the longer you spend with a cap fleet in enemy space, the more likely they are to start dropping titans in and popping you ships, the more likely they are to start harassing your ships, if not enough time to call every last friend they have and hit your fleet with a few hundred dreads. that's what would happen.so, sitting in a hostile system, logged in, in siege, for 2.5 hours... this would be silly, bordering on suicidal. i'm fairly certain it would take far longer than that anyway. i've been in fleets led by goons, -a-, atlas, tcf, and razer fcs. getting from 1 tower to the next tower in the same system takes a lot longer than the 2 minutes you give it. and that's assuming there are no problems. that's assuming intel doesn't come that a hostile fleet is near and everyone has to safe up. that's assuming everyone sieges and warps like clockwork (which never happens in a big fleet). that's assuming you can keep a fleet together for hours just to flip one system."

3/18/2010,i'm pretty sure this was taken to ccp(csm4) because even if it was handled by csm3 it still hasn't happened yet.
3/18/2010,"this is where show stops, sorry.ccp has stated, that they can't present you these details without currently needed clicking one by one - or it will load servers too much.basically, when you open any hangar or container with bpo/bpc, server sends you list: ""this is bpo/bpc for -insert name-"". server does not make immediate full query for bpc type and details (me, pe, runs...). according to ccp, it is too big a load. i don't know why, but they are supposed to know that stuff...without solving this problem, any interface will not make wonders."
3/18/2010,"you can get that information right away1. go to science and industry2. go to (corp) blueprint tab3. pick the type you want (copy/original)4. *double click* on the station you want5. you get a nice new window which lists all blueprints and their stats.important: if that hangar has many blueprints (1000+) opening the new window can be really slow.and if you keep the (corp) blueprint tab open it will reload on every job you set up. for such big hangars, switch the tab in the science and industry window to jobs or installations.then it wont update the blueprint list when setting up jobs, but atleast the client stays fast."
3/18/2010,"if you can electronically transmit blueprints from one place to another place, then you should be able to ""hack"" the communication and steal them. in fact, you should be able to ""hack"" (an in-game mechanic) comms too. in fact, there's a number of things that people should be able to break into that are protected by game mechanics. bpos/bpcs have no reason to have the same kind of protection as other things (like your hangar for instance)."

3/18/2010,i'm talking about this part.^^so any new ideas are pointless?
3/18/2010,"a new idea in this direction, yes, because it's already been discussed and the smartbomb option was dismissed by ccp."
3/18/2010,this could have been sokratesz's original post. this is the information csm is supposed to provide to the community.
3/18/2010,"kind of like when the players wanted a training que and ccp dismissed it. it's a good thing the players didn't bother to keep pushing for it and waste their time. oh wai...but then they wouldn't be egods, with the rest of the eve community worshiping them and begging for bit of information."
3/18/2010,or getting rid of pos bowling.or getting rid of pos warfare.or the modular pos concept that players have been begging for since a few seconds after players touched poss. csm has brought it up. it has been requested more than once during fanfest.csm exists to push for the changes the masses want.
3/18/2010,"funny, what else was omitted from the minutes?"

3/18/2010,there's a diff between hiring concord to play the game for you and letting new players hire concord to help cleanup the fail pvpers who can only canflip newbs rather than actually go outside to 0.0 where real players can kill them.i'm all for it. not only will it help to increase the population but it might also force these losers to come out to 0.0 and play. :-p the more out here the merrier.
3/18/2010,"wrong, its the most boring and worthless job, especially for new players.this thread looks like ""my macrominer bot don't mine good enough because some bad people steals all the ore it mines"""
3/18/2010,i'm all for it as long as it is also possible to bribe concord to ignore attacks on npc corp members.
3/18/2010,"not supported.new players need to learn about theft and laziness. i mined when i started and read about how jetcan mining was a risk, i then moved to a less populated .7 system so i could anchor a huge secure container, all i could afford after i bought a destroyer + several miners,skill books etc. paying concord to pop people for theft, when they don't ever do it anywhere else, is for lack of a more effective way to say it, stupid. the tutorials are an important part of the new player experience and if people would actually pay attention to them they would learn a lot about the game most notably is how you can leave a system to go somewhere else, yet many new players decide to stay in the starter systems until they are prodded out. the real problem is new players don't understand that after they do all the tutorials they should go somewhere else not start mining belts where half the time(when i was coming up) the roids were all eaten by some jagoff in a retriever or hulk."

3/18/2010,it's a good idea for close ranged weapons but wouldn't it adversely affect long ranged weapons like artillery and railguns?
3/18/2010,"this reminds me of the issue where the ""hero tank"" drake (or nighthawk - don't remember which it was) flew to 0km on the hyperion it was fighting in the last alliance tourney, and hugged it for a minute or so. the hyperion basically was unable to hit it but the missiles had no trouble slowly breaking down the hyperion's tank, leading to the almost dead nighthawk/drake coming from behind for the win. this ""mechanic"" should be fixed."
3/18/2010,"comments:- it sounds like you're attempting to explain how something looks closer as its nearer or further away as its further away - and is subsequently easier/harder to hit because of it. i think it would be better for all involved if we kept it simple - perhaps by sig_radius to perceived_sig_radius = real_sig_radius * (optimal+falloff)/range.- this might scale for battleship or capital combat, but it will definitely end up being a *massive* nerf to frigate combat with falloffs *always* being cut to 1/3rd what they should be.- there was once a thread in the game dev forum here (search for gabriel karrade or wade through my own posting history) which had many suggestions for how to change the tracking formula. all of them were much simpler than this, and there was a great abundance of graphs to illustrate how things would change.-liang"
3/18/2010,"please, could you explain that? i cannot see how frigates, the ships with the best weapon resolution, will suffer from this. they will benefit from much bigger faloff and even more tracking while shooting bigger targets, and will have no effect when shooting other frigates. please, explain what you mean. i cannot understand that.."
3/18/2010,"the issue is simple. eve calculates the chance to hit based on the radius of the object being shot (m), the speed it is traveling (m/s), and the speed the guns can transit... in rad/s.eve converts the speed to rad/s (presumably), but does not convert the size to rads. to fix the math, everything needs to be measured using the same stick. either have everything converted to radians (a measurement of plane angle) or meters (a measurement of length). to convert the ship size to radians, a simple algorithm is used. that was sort of a joke. that would likely increase server load in a noticeable way. it can be simplified a lot though by just using the pythagorean theorem and a willingness to accept that it is ""close enough"". this would be a lighter calculation for the servers. this would be a step back, in that the server limit (before they start smoking, crying, and quitting on us) on how many people could be shooting at each other on one node would decrease."

3/18/2010,"so this is a fairly simple concept im just gonna throw out here.what is itwhenever you achieve level 5 in a particular skill give the player the option to throttle the skill back down to a level 4 or lower if the player ever chooses to do so.why would this be usefuli will give an example. if you are running a dual or triple armour rep setup and you know you are not quite going to have enough capacitor to run them all permanently, but you know that a quick downgrade to a level 4 repair systems skill would allow you to permanently keep running them and sufficently tanking the dps you could simply throttle the skill to achieve a stable capacitor.i admit it might be limited in scope, but im positive there would be other uses for this option.tldr - it would be nice when you have trained a skill to level 5 to be able to downgrade a skill of a module due to capacitor concerns."
3/18/2010,or you could just pulse the second or third repper.i do that all the time.not supported.

3/18/2010,this. stop spamming this important forum!
3/18/2010,maybe ccp could implement an option to blank the screen during warp for those whose sensibilities are hurt by warping through stuff.
3/18/2010,"ccp could probably solve this by using some kind of graphical distortion that bends everything around the warp tunnel. however, i assume this would cause weaker graphics cards to cry big crocodile tears. it might be nice to have something like this implemented as a graphics option (so most people don't see the clipping issue).also, op needs spell checker."

3/18/2010,"i see there was a vote against the localization of the csm logs. i'm currious why meissa voted against. not that it's very important, just currious.edit: more elaborately, if the worry was the increased workload on ccp and isd, why worry about it when it's a job and people get payed for it anyway? i mean, isn't that like complaining about garbage disposal because it sucks that it's needed, even though people make a living doing it?"
3/18/2010,"the proposal specifically stated to ability for player volunteers to submit translations and thus not increase the load on ccp/isd.the comment about it being somebody's job isn't accurate in this context because this would be a new responsibility.rather than require ccp to commit more time to this (and thus less time to other things) we suggested that volunteers could be given the tools to do the translations instead. of course if this system works there is nothing to stop ccp doing more official translations in the future, but we need to start somewhere. speaking of which, i notice that the links on the wiki now contain /en/ which makes me wonder if the wiki is setup for multiple languages"

3/18/2010,which stats are you referencing? could you post a link for the discussion?
3/18/2010,"i'd bet you isk the ships lost/subscriber to pve will be much lower than those pvp figures. i'd also bet my entire account that the isk value in a given month of ships lost to pvp exceeds those lost in purely pve pursuits. how many people lose titans to mission rats?you can point to .62 ships/subscribers and say it's low, but as you note the vast majority of accounts are currently in empire (not to mention that a fair number of eve players have indy and pvp accounts). the fact is that stat points out that, on average, well over half the accounts on the server experience a pvp ship loss once a month. whether they are looking for it or not ;) and dont get me started on the numerous ways people avoid recorded ship loss in pvp, even when they are on the losing end of an engagement (docking games, neutral rr, self destruction). and lets be honest, empire supports a much higher proportion of macro/isk farmer/isk seller accounts than lowsec/0.0/wh space, accounts which literally do nothing but npc (see stats on unholy rage)i'd say with less than 30% of accounts residing outside of empire raising that number to over half a subscriber indicates a high level of impact. that would support the argument that the demand of that 30% is what makes the activity of the empire care bears worthwhile.believe me, i came to eve from matrix online where the only way items went out of game was gradual wear and tear through pve pursuits. that economy was dead in like 3 months. in eve, you dont even have wear and tear aside from ammo consumption (which doesnt even apply for drones and lasers). the fact with eve is that unless you're still learning how to do w/e pve activity you're engaging in, death is a rarity. even c6 sleepers get regularly manhandled by practiced groups of pvers (tune in to the planet risk show for evidence).you are correct that really only ccp holds the definitive answer to this though. all i can do is highlight the indications that show pvp to be a much higher and much more consistent source of demand than purely pve pursuits."
3/18/2010,"i would like to see stats from ccp about ships lost in pvp and pve (and their total values) before continuing this, it'll be pretty futile otherwise."
3/18/2010,"i suspect that the huge majority of ""non pvp"" losses are to concord and insurance-fraud self-destructs.as it is, 299,000k subs with 0.67 losses per sub per month is 200,000 pvp losses per month. that's a hell of a lot of ships, modules and rigs to keep the industrial side ticking over.i would be very suprised indeed to learn that ""true"" pve losses (ie: excluding concord and self-destructs) were even a tenth of this figure. if you disclude ""learning losses"" from accounts less than, say, 60 days old, i would guess that the figure falls even further."
3/18/2010,"even pure pve mission runners engage in pvp every time they sell their mission loot.pvp is player vs player, it doesn't require ship vs ship(s). without ever firing a shot you can engage in pvp by* trading* reactions* moon mining* invention* mining (seriously, you can go mine roids to stop others getting them all )etc.as more and more stuff moves from npc production to player production (yay for planetary interaction) there are even more opportunities for pvp.and this is why eve is so much more interesting than other games"
3/18/2010,"i never classed that stuff as pvp. i use the original meaning of pvp which is combat between players causing a loss, or two or more players fighting. not this new definition some eve forum users like to use.if you play on a no pvp server or in a no pvp zone you still have trading and resources. if you buy a pve game it never ever lists trade and resource gathering as pvp. in fact i cannot think of a single game not even pvp games where you list trading and resource gathering as pvp in the features. if you look up a list of pvp games it always about combat only. features about pvp are always combat related.the term pvp originated in reference to players killing players hence the verse bit of pvp. why all of a sudden do we have to change its meaning to refer to pretty much everything? pvp meant combat between players for something like 20+ years.teadaze said "" pvp is player vs player, it doesn't require ship vs ship(s). without ever firing a shot you can engage in pvp by""it does require a player to be competing against another player. pvp requires a player verse another player. when i sell mission loot i am not competing against another player so there is no verse another player. when i am mining i am not competing when there is plenty to go around same for reactions and moon mining. still even if you are competing pvp feels wrong as its a combat team not a generic cover all player competing against another player team and now i wrote far too much about something i shouldn't have responded to :) thanks for the fun. lets pvp on the forums some more."

3/19/2010,i agree font type and size should be adjustable.... i would like to have really big and easy to read letters.even better would be to get the option to customize your user interface like in other games. that would outsource a problem of eve in a way.
3/19/2010,fixing rockets themselves would go a long towards fixing this problem. not that i'm disagreeing with the motion for a fourth bonus. it really is needed.agree absolutely. i also seriously think the wolf's shield and armour resistances should be swapped.here i agree as well. the enyo is a much maligned ship in need of a boost.
3/19/2010,"full on support. i love flying assault frigates, but they're way out of whack, balancewise."
3/19/2010,yes to this.
3/19/2010,"what? i only stated that most af's need a boost, but the ishkur is not one of them. balanced =/= equal. would you think that a wolf's style would be even similar to an ishkur's style, even when desirability would be similar?could you point out where i stated that af's should resemble one another other then in desirability?"

3/19/2010,"projection much? lets compare posts....yours...mine...i'm talking about dps and i'm proving that the hype is thoroughly outclassed as is and with the boost would still find itself quite in line with lasers for the damage/range.then stop bringing them upwe have done the proper analysis, you apparently haven't if you think 490 damage is all that extraordinary an output for a hype to be at, a point that it would only reach -after- the 15% damage boost we're proposing. you're also continuing to fail to propose an alternative to more damage, i'm open to suggestions and even new information but you have to produce some, not simply re-argue the same points that were put down pages ago. myself i think that either a direct damage boost or a damage boost in the form of rof with some big reductions to cap use would be appropriate, if you have ideas share them."
3/19/2010,"you realise you are the only one harping about pulses, right? self awareness is good to have though, i applaud your sincerity.thank you for being so sincere and self effacing, you have made your point, i agree, no need to bash yourself any more. 20km is the difference between 170-150km. if you fly in sniper fleets, you know what does that mean.you do a pretty good job of it yourself, no need us to help you do that.where is that proposal you are talking about again?i did my analysis and presented it, therefore this wind bagging must be what you are up to, right?things like 10% more pg, 15% more damage and 10% less optimal, maybe?our kb disagrees. a scout does wonders, support is an important asset and if you think that an rr fleet is going to be the absolute answer, you are deluding yourself. the only real problematic encounter we had in our sniperfleets was genos with nanoed machariels.as for stealth bombers, 7 bombs are 56k damage, if you see more than 8 bombs, the sbs are fail and the bombs ineffective. if you are there for the 2nd wave and haven't warped out, you are doing it wrong."
3/19/2010,"i'll take this bait just for a giggle. i've already said a decrease to fittings and a change to capacitor use are the things i'd start with. i'm not going to provide actual numbers, because without testing you can never be sure of those until the actual patch. i would also have a 3rd modifier on hold which i would use if those 2 changes didn't appear to do enough for rails. that 3rd mod would most likely be a change in range modifiers on t1 ammos. i would say changing all ammo for by an increase in 20% range would be a good 3rd option as a back up. that means am would be 30% redux, iridium would be a 50% boost to range, etc. that would help both gallente and especially caldari big time with both rails and blaster fits. there's nothing in the books that says ammo's have to be between -50% and + 60%, so this seems like a very viable fix to gallente weapons. obviously t2 short range would really need a fix if this were to go in effect.obviously you are eft warrioring and speculating about bombers if you really think that's how they work. we warp 20-40 bombers on top of enemies in 1-2 waves as do many of our opponents and have no problem landing 80% of the bombs if not more. the reason that works is, no matter what, the first 8 bombs are going to hit. also, it takes 3.51 seconds of separation between bombs for 0 damage to be inflicted on by one on the other. with lag, and personal delay, and peoples very slow nature to get into warp and to load grid, this is virtually nothing.i don't honestly know who ushra khan could possibly be fighting over there in napville in large numbers. i do however know how badly it performed against goons bombers, how most people fair against ch and evoke bombers, and how the nc and russians up north have done with their bombers. any sniper fleet is usually dead within about 15 seconds of landing on grid these days up north. even if they use anti bomber tactics, they lose a chunk of bs that are close enough anyways... remember, bombs have a 30km diameter of effect. and for the record, i've only brought up pulses because some deuche is trying to disprove my faith in rails because i've flow a ton of pulse ships lately. i honestly love the sniper hype, i've just seen 0 reason to fly a sniper ship in the past 4 months."
3/19/2010,"which would do absolutely nothing. i can already fit 8 railguns on a hyperion or 7 railguns on a megathron - how would decreasing the fittings result in any change whatsoever to their ability to output damage? how would it boost the rokh back up to being a viable sniper again?i'm not really following the logic here. the only thing you'd do with the extra cpu/pg would be to fit a bigger buffer, but how does that help balance railguns?hitting at 30km like a wet noodle is the same as hitting at 60km like a wet noodle. the only time that changes is when the target is scrammed. altering the ammo ranges would do very little to help their performance. it doesn't fix their alpha, their tracking, their dps or their limited damage types.i love lady gaga but that doesn't mean people don't look at me funny when i tell them for a very good reason... <_<>_>"
3/19/2010,"lol what? are you suggesting it ever was a viable sniper? it is hard to fit with an armor tank (few low slots), does jack for damage, and can't track to support itself outside a blob.if you love it, you would fly it. if you don't fly it then perhaps you only like the way it looks?"
3/19/2010,i would like to have at least 2 orbit ranges that would be easy to access. maybe right clicking the toggle is betterand then if you want to set it you have to ctrl click or ctrl right click. same with keep at range commands.

3/19/2010,"over the last couple years i ran the idea of swapping out the map browser with a navigational panel by several people and they liked it and wanted me to post it here on the forums. finally i have some time i am willing to spend laying it out visually. the concept here is to streamline what we already have at our disposal. reconfiguring so that information we want is closer together and as few as clicks away as possible.if you are a little confused about what each section does, please read the description. video may follow if it is still confusing.the concept(flag icon) common destinations this basically takes places you have in your bookmarks and makes them easily accessible. ideally users would setup their own groups, call them what they want and have as many drop downs as they want. (planet arrow icon) current routethis combines the information we have on the left with the information we can get from going to the star map. (four bars icon) _____ solar systemtaking the only useful info from the map browser and moving it here.(gradient outline ball icon) proximityfocusing on the system you are in, gives you information about the system you are heading to and some additional information about adjacent systems.why?common destinations - right people either use the note pad or their assets window for common destinations. i've even setup specific chat channels with motd's for common way points. using the systems in place now works, but being able to click drag destinations into a navigation specific window would be ace in my book.current route - if you have several systems to stop in, unless you are on autopilot you may skip right over them because the info on the left of our screens does not say when to stop. the best way to see the info is in the map/autopilot/way points tab. even though you have your overview available, you can not see the space around you, and getting the sense of what is around you is even worse if you have a 'travel' overview setting. merging the map/autopilot/way points tab with the standard autopilot (navigation) info on the left into a specific tab would improve the clumsy feel we have now of getting that same information.proximity - all to often you have to find an alternate route. sometimes you have to find it quickly and fumbling around menus is extremely frustrating. it is information that we already have it is just extremely difficult to get it all at once. the proximity window solves this. it gets most pilots who would need a navigation tab the info they want."
3/19/2010,"this is most excellent. thanks you for taking the time to make a spiffy ui mockup. i can see this going places can i take out a box off the panel? since you plan to remove the route stuff on the left, itd be nice to let me take out the current route panel and place it somewhere i like. also, wouldnt the optimize and clear waypoints button be better placed within the current route panel?"

3/19/2010,"agreed this is a nice proposition for the csm, there is the proximity feature that is on itself a nice thing but will eliminate the scouts for a part and make things a bit easier in eve which is a good or a bad thing. depends how u look at it.supported"

3/19/2010,"nobody forces you to train sp without stop. if you don't need all those skills to fly cheap crap, why do you keep training? how about training your alt to reasonable level instead?just because many people are lazy and stupid (don't realize the choices they have) doesn't mean ccp should keep dumbing down the game for them.eve is one game where the stupid actually fail, and forced to quit. ccp already made a lot of cuts and simplifications to gameplay, as a result the average intelligence of eve online community has dropped significantly - as anyone who played from 2004 can confirm.lets keep the average intelligence above 4chan level."
3/19/2010,"because i want to fly the expensive stuff to, i fly everything sub capital (from frigs to deadspace fit pirate ship in pvp) and have no intentions of training capital skills ever, and im still far from flying everything sub cap. and i have alts, 9 of them in fact, whereof 5 of them have clone costs (before implants) at 20m+.... also pointing out again, none of them have capital skills. why the heck should i have to grind for at least an hour just to replace my clone unimplanted because i want to go roam in 0.0 in a frig/cruiser? or 2-3 hours if i dual/triple account... at that rate it is cheaper to dual/triple account with t2 fit battleships in low-sec... seriously, unless this gets changed, im going back to exclusive low sec pvp. ccp wants more people in 0.0 <- see what increasing clone costs do? exactly the opposite. also, how is more pvp'ing instead of grinding bad?"
3/19/2010,"counter strike has more pvp than in eve. you want counter strike in space?maybe besides the free clones, you want free ships and insta spawn in new equipped shipped? why market grind when we could have more pvp if we simply spawned in system of death with new ship with same fittings? we'd have tons of pvp then!or perhaps what makes eve pvp so special is because losing stuff actually hurts people?"
3/19/2010,sorry where in any of the discussion about clone costs has there been mention of free clones apart from those against the idea?no one is asking for free clones just a re-balancing of their costs.
3/19/2010,"he does that. a lotfor many, suggesting an adjustment to the rate clone costs increase is equivalent to giving everyone a ~ cmd prompt option and a list of cheat codes."
3/19/2010,i think that a change is needed is a no brainer..i can understand the fear of making the game easier which should by no means happen. but the problem with the clone cost is merely a undesireable use of a money sink which restricts gameplay options. the real benefit of a high sp character is its versatility. this reduction in versatility is surely not intentional. this will not make the game easier in any way or even have a strong impact on the wallet of the older players. but it will result in more active gameplay. how to adress the problem is something that should be discussed as well.. but i guess it would be helpful to know that the devs are actually willing to change this cost distribution in some way.this problem will become even more apparent in the future. it is only a matter of time before it gets dealt with in one way or another.
3/19/2010,"i have never, ever heard that on vent. i cant believe that any pvper would ever say that.and i certainly pvp. and 95% of the pvp that i do is in 0.0. in the last year, pod losess have cost me, let's see something like 300 million isk. and i'm not even very good at pvp. i just pay attention and - whenever possible - stay aligned. if i lose a ship, i spam the warp button. my pod usually gets out. that's all there is too it.i get my isk from ratting and missioning. no mighty trade empires or pos chains for me. i'm too lazy and not really smart enough to do stuff like that. and yet - somehow - i manage to find the ~600k a day that getting podded costs me."
3/19/2010,supported. always entertaining to see drake draconis in these thread posting about pvp and clone loss.
3/19/2010,even malcanis agrees dr. whinesmith.and i don't like his stance on eve economics... irony.this goes for all of you.... when it gets right down to it... your just too damn lazy to keep watch over your wallets.this game is spreading lazyness like a cancer.
3/19/2010,"balancing clone costs is hardly going to be counter strike in space... just instead of 1 cruiser you can now use maybe 2-3, making people much more satisfied over their night of pvp'ing. there is no one saying clones should be free! ''or perhaps what makes eve pvp so special is because losing stuff actually hurts people?'' stuff/ships, not making old players not able to have some nights of cheap fun every now and then when we're tired of flying bigger stuff."

3/19/2010,supported. unfair to casual gamers.
3/19/2010,you can 'blitzkrieg' only the initial assault. taking a system takes at best 4-5 days with all the rf timers in defenders prime time. it's not like your 50 dreads come out of blue when defender has 2 days of rf timer to stare at and organize defense fleet for particular time in his prime. let's take for example d-g in providence. i would say that no matter what amount of stations would have been in the system the outcome would have been the same. even without defenders inexperience dealing with lag. as far as saying that 50 dreads can't stay around 2 - 3 hours that just silly. i have seen dreads sitting in pos during 40-u campaign for 2 weeks straight 4-5 h a day waiting for action. if you are taking over station system where defenders do actually turn up you do not 'go home'. you stick to it until job is done. the rf timers make damn sure that there is absolute max numbers present on both sides. if defender cant bring that big blob he loses and if he can he wins regardless if attacker has to kill 1 outpost or 20.

3/19/2010,"seems like it would make sense to divorce them from the item database then, wouldn't it? the server doesn't struggle to load all your skills, what levels they are at, etc. they are just there, either you do or don't have it and it has stats which are <value>. it even goes one step further and shows you ones you don't have but qualify for and ones you don't at all if you so desire. i, therefore, assert that you could do the same thing with blueprints. it only needs to show whether you do or don't have one, what it's me/pe is, and that you have created y amount of copies for use as well. all that would look clean on one menu, each in it's own row. for the purposes of theft which you repeatedly insist this is avoiding, an inside man who would be able to steal anything anyway could by clicking 'eject' and take the whole thing wherever.as far as the more conventional kinds of theft that occur when the inevitable mistake is made traveling around, you could just assume that it is either located in your 'pod' or in a little black box or whatever. the pirates could then scoop it and remove the parts they are interested in and trash the rest when they get it home. pretty simple, no evasion of theft involved.@di mulle, thank you for the helpful pointers, i am a big fan of the blueprint tab, i think it would be even better if it were organized by manufactured item type and not location dropdowns. the blueprint hangar is a terrible place to go for information, and i continue to assert that it doesn't need to be there.@bagehi, i think the idea of hacking/intercepting player communications and inventory sounds especially appealing, but even in modern electronic communications confidential data is transferred in such a way as to be almost impossible without performing an exhaustive search that would only yield pitiful amounts of data. for more information you can read on aes cryptography [@"

3/19/2010,that'd be good but just in case it doesn't go through... maybe it's the tons of exhumers littering the belts?
3/19/2010,quick question before i reply in full. you say you have petitioned this and you insinuated that the petitions were upheld in some fashion. does ccp consider use of these tactics to be illegal exploits for which they punish players for using?
3/19/2010,"the only one that is being considered an exploit (quietly) is the deep deep deep space log off trick.you log in... and log off... log in... log off.. .log in... eventually you end up in the ass end of the system.and thanks to grid fu you end up on the overview a kajillion au away from destination.we caught some prick doing this in one of our systems... the gm actually shoved his shiny carrier butt in the station because someone got screen-shots to prove it. of which we camped 23/7 until he managed to sneak out using the same damn trick right after downtime.they said they haven't publicly announced it as such so what i'm saying is likely going to be disproved or ""meh'd"" and still require proof. not easy considering.the only reason that's being even considered as such mind you is due to the fact its abuse of said mechanic.disconnections and logoffskies?as i've said before.... pull the ethernet cable from your tower and the server doesn't have a damn clue what your doing.the moment you get that figured out... is the moment you understand that while this mechanic ""sucks"".... it isn't as simple to fix.all thanks to tcp/ip.if anything there needs to be a change for when you log back in.... should be the exact same spot regardless.and perhaps the best solution for that is that the said location remains ""stuck"" until your session timer (double it if you need to) expires.. then you can write a new location.should be warped in long before it times out.but they likely have already fixed that with tyranis on the horizon. and i do mean specifically that.you will likely never get a ultimate solution to this.so while disconnections and logoffskies will be around... the logging on process will be nailed down as its logically the only rational solution to track.it's impossible to track disconnections because if you attempt to do so on the server side... you will likely get accused of misjudging and ccp will never take that liability on.the last thing they want to do is deal with ship reimbursement complaints on that level.however... if you log back in... your going to log back in in such a way that it is entirely predictable within reason.... and if people camp that spot... they will get a all be it brief window of opportunity to pod said person."
3/19/2010,"so basically 1 is a glitch, 3 is an abused safety feature and 2 is a ccp error somewhere. 2 - almost impossible to prove and the time it was proven in your above scenario the gm placed them in a station which he later escaped from using the exact same tactic. i'm going to assume a little something here. that the people supporting this thread are low-sec null-sec primarily. so i will reserve any vitriol for those i consider deserving of it. as you said, there really is not way to stop the ""logoffski"" trick w/o punishing people who are not using it. (a friend was a victim of a dropout a couple of nights ago and ccp gave him the usual - we had no lag no our system so it was yours, tuff luck.) i am going to surpise myself and support this proposal, my first, even though i'm a newb carebear/mission runner right now. i've been nailed in low sec 2 days into the game, can-flipped, had some attempt to gank me and had ninja-salvagers in my corp mates missions. these are people generally associated with pirates and low sec/ null sec dwellers. i'm going to support this anyway. i'm doing so really for one reason only, its a flaw that should be fixed. even if i consider other areas of the game to be broken, some of which i cannot think of a fix for anyway (not really despite the threads about them), and i'm currently on the dead opposite side of you, they should at least fix fix this. so often it seems the don't want to fix, or rebalance or even improve the damned font! maybe if i can get them to setting people to fixing problems, they will eventually get around to mine. (well, that and i want to be able to use your own tactics against you in the near future.:done above poster was correct though. this really should have found another way to raise this issue w/o detailing what action is taken. if i had the opportunity to use this against someone who had tried to gank me or ninja salved me, i would in an instant. just the thought of them spitting on their monitor in frustration brings a smile to my face.good luck with this.(bloody pirates!)"
3/19/2010,just in case you didnt read the link .... ccp will change that mechanic in tyrranis. so the thread is already obsolete.
3/19/2010,"1. the exploit is impossible to track because it usually occurs during a session change (jumping into a gate camp) and session changes are often when normal disconnects occur (ever click ""undock"" and found yourself staring at your desktop instead?).2. i'm under the impression this trick has been solved to some extent. current mechanic is that even if you do end up 700 au away, it will warp you back (eventually) to where you started and there is nothing you can do about it. however, there is no reason the server shouldn't flag this and dump the character back at their original location for 2 hours (just out of spite) if it is done more than twice in a row.3. not familiar with this, but i live in the world where bubbles exist. if this is the case, it should be fixed.so, 2 & 3 should be fixed, but 1 is just something we have to deal with until ccp finds a way to win at the internets and prevent disconnections from ever happening again."

3/19/2010,"the planar layout is easily explained by rotational forces. if the ship does not settle (which i support), it should be manually alignable to the plane (and the ever-important checkbox to switch it on and off)."
3/19/2010,"does not work with ctrl+space, the ship settles."
3/19/2010,"supported because i would use this frequently. i.e.: i came out of warp within a giant veldspar cluster and therefore my manoeuvring options are rather limited. i spotted a convenient opening right above me. i dont want to get out of here just yet since the giant rocks make spiffy interceptors barriers. i will want to get out fast if i have to. i can double click right above me and do my best to manually set speed as near zero as possible; just so i dont really move much yet my ship have its nose aligned where i want to. when i need to get out of here i set full speed and right off i go, laughing at the interceptor now stuck on a rock..in short, no auto-leveling is nice because i can plan and setup an egress path without spinning the camera first... see what i mean?the auto-level thing makes it an unperfect tactic since i can never really leave my ship pointing up without actually moving. its bound to (slowly) move itself out of the cool hideout over time. ill have to try the manual accelerate and decelerate commands. it never occurred to me that it keep the ships heading even when at 0 m/s. its [ctrl] [+] and [ctrl] [-] respectively, i think. i never use this because i found it erratic in response and difficult to make it stop accelerating/decelerating at will and at the speed i want. hmm.. perhaps only trigger the auto-leveling feature if you hit [ctrl] [space] a second time once the ship velocity is already (or very close to) 0 m/s?"

3/19/2010,"what u fail to understand is that's the price u pay for this profession--u want to reward the newbies for not using their brain to explore/try better ways to make isk besides the absolute easiest, effortless way to do so. this is not world of warcraft, where the game is designed to force u to play a certain way. u want better isk, use a better way to get it."
3/19/2010,"currently, weapon damage and rof rigs take about 2x calibration points than all other ""important"" rigs.considering that both damage and rof rigs are stacking penalized with ship damage mods, is there any reason for their calibration requirement to be this high?i have never seen any good reason for it and attribute this design flaw to ""damage-phobia"" that ccp seems to be suffering from. if it is a real condition then they should seek therapy, but somehow find the strength to admit they were wrong and overcome their fears by fixing the issue."
3/19/2010,"supported, this is one of my pet peeves. maybe cut the calibration of the t1 rigs to 150 and the t2s to 225."
3/19/2010,"not supported.damage rigs are fine. they aren't meant to be an omgwtf i can gank with my bc and 2k dps. they can replace your damage mods, thus leaving you with low slots for other important things. they calibration points are high because they can be so effective in the right hands. learn how to fit a ship other than, maximize raw damage."
3/19/2010,"as it is now, the shield extender and armor buffer rigs are about 10x more valuable in pvp situation that a damage rigs.just 3 cheap buffer rigs are equivalent to a full grade slave set. while it would take 2 damage rigs to achieve equivalent of 1 damage mod.if you are seriously concerned about rig balance in pvp, and you are on the conservative side about how powerful they should be - you should also support changing buffer rigs to have same requirements as damage rigs. am i correct?"
3/19/2010,"reducing them to 150 (50+ more than the 'utility' weapon rigs) would be near ideal.allows blowing two rigs in place of a damage mod and still have calibration for range, tracking etc. especially potent on small hulls and hulls with limited 'spare' low slots. if buffer module calibration is upped by 50 it still conveniently prevents faction hulls from being able to use 2 dmg + buffer rigs.buffer rigs really need to be looked at as well, way too good for their meagre cost, but not relevant to this thread unless title is changed"
3/19/2010,never had a problem here... but then i tend to fit my ships differently... fail fits perhaps... but never encountered an issue with a short fall in calibration points.perhaps you should start posting your fits to prove your case...
3/19/2010,agree'ing on this.
3/19/2010,rarely see a reason to put a damage rig in. regardless of the calibration points.
3/19/2010,"it strikes me that giving damage rigs a boost like this would serve to further make active tanking more obsolete, not supported."
3/19/2010,"it's quite the opposite, actually.right now pvp setups are dominated by buffer tanking rigs, correct?by making damage rigs a little more attractive, it reduces the usage of buffer rigs, which in turn increases the power ratio of active tank vs buffer tank."
3/19/2010,"i can't think of a non-offensive way to tell you how much that made my head hurt. how would it affect buffer tanking worse than it would affect active tanking?buffer tanking is already preferable in any situation beyond small gang warfare where you have high incoming dps - more than an active tank can handle. the more incoming dps, the quicker the active tank will be overwhelmed and die.in other words, this would further increase the need for larger buffers to keep a ship alive long enough for either rr platforms to target and start repping, or for it to find some kind of escape route or deal enough damage back in a short enough time to live.either way, it does nothing to promote active tanks."
3/19/2010,where do you get the active tank tangent from? this is about a perceived imbalance of the fitting requirements of weapon rigs. active tanking vs. buffer tanking is an entirely different beast altogether with its own multiple proposals floating around.
3/19/2010,"as i have said above, sure you can make it completely life-like if you want to, and i will be all for that, but what i am trying propose here is a compromise."
3/19/2010,"i worry that frigates would be too easily hit by weapons when they are orbiting close. this has merit in rl physics too: think an xwing fighter flying between the death stars guns. if anything, it gets harder for a large ship to hit a frigate the closer the frigate is, because it can fly between the big ships guns.doesn't mean i don't like the idea: maybe the signature radius increase would only occur with hulls of equal or greater size: this would approximately take into account the fact that smaller ships could fit between the guns, and ships of the same or larger size can't (fit between the guns)."
3/19/2010,"i think it would be a good move to give corp management the ability to assign pos roles by size. as smalls and mediums typically have less influence and utility than larges, they should be opened up to more players. the problem as it stands currently is that you can't offer someone the right to plop down a personal pos without granting them full access to the large towers. as large towers are typically half of the equation in sovereignty atm due to the location of bridges, high end moons and jammers, most corps refuse to just grant access willy nilly.so lets create corp roles that can be grantable specifically to the size of a tower, or maybe even go a step further and allow racial designation of tower control to corp members. ie player a can only drop a small tower or gallente racial tower. as a manager of roles in the past, i know this would be a huge boost to corp managements abilities, and give players more opportunities to sink money into towers."
3/19/2010,"sure, why not?roles / corp management is awful, though, and is already something that needs desperate attention.why not bundle this within?there'd need to have a separate attribute on the ct that designates which size it is, but if that were tied into role management, it'd probably be possible. a lot of extra tables, sure, but that's up to ccp, i guess."

3/19/2010,"with the number of abandoned towers i see floating about in w-space, i think it would make sense to allow for seizure of an offline tower by another corp. would make sense to tie it to hacking as well. possibly new modules or drones to assist in the process."
3/19/2010,this topic has nothing to do with 0.0.nothing to do with ratting.nothing to do with how much isk is in your wallet.nothing to do with alliances or how they operate.nothing to do with how many hours a day you play or how often you grind.it is simply about high sp characters being locked out of small ship pvp by a mechanic that forces them to fly bs or higher to get value for money.
3/19/2010,"an ingame brute force type program would be cool, as long as it also takes as long or near as long as a real bf program. the owners would then have an opportunity to notice that something is out of the ordinary and do something to protect his cargo.as for people who do use the same password as their logins, the game should easily put in some features to prevent this. it could be as simple as a notation in the password field saying ""make sure not to use the same password as you login."" or as complex as actually comparing a players container password to their login password and denying its use.on the brute force side, players could be able to create a bf dictionary of say 100 words or combinations only that their bf program can use. the user would not know which one was the proper one thus making it still a little cryptic, only that they gained access. players would have to fill in all 100 bf pwords to cut down on the chance of knowing which one it actually was....... yes i know not fulll proof to some of you script kiddies but hey, what is??"

3/20/2010,"this argument is stupid. stations are a logistical backbone, not defenses. if you whant alliances to be able to concentrate their logistics, you will need more then one station per system. obviously taking the station over takes time, what, you whan to get it for free? if someone invested money into building multiple stations, it will take more effort to take that away from him, that much seems obvious to me. there isn't an artificial limit on amount of people, you will crash teh server, that's a technical limit. they are two different things."
3/20/2010,"allow stations to change hands but disallow any station management unless sovereignty is held (ie. anyone can dock/undock until system outcome is determined).or go even further and disallow access to services entirely unless sovereignty is held. you can dock/undock, providing a beachhead but not much else.want to take a multi-station system? make sure you have the logistics in place and the manpower available because it is going to be a long slog."
3/20/2010,the point is that it takes multiple days for a system with a single station already.so having multiple outpost in one system and having to take them one after each other is just stupid.
3/20/2010,this argument has already been dealt with. why are you still going on about it?
3/20/2010,"it seems that you finally will request a big code rewriting for some minor rp purpose - if every basic mechanics stay in place btw, some good technical discussion about technical topic (one of the many in recent years, ofc) is here. not the op himself, he is rather hysterically ignorant, but answers are quite explaining."
3/20/2010,"hi mulle, thank you for the link. it lead me back to a thread with more official responses then the usual speculative rebuttals industry requests attract. i'm assuming an unfair amount of insight into the game's code, but i don't think it would be the most difficult rework ever put on the table. that few of the core elements need to change would be a big help, the industry process works very well and i would like to keep it as much as possible.the rp element of the proposal, 'why would super secret blueprints be carried around on disk when ftl communication is safer, faster and cooler?', has it's own merits, i don't think that merely citing it as an rp change means it should be discounted. it is, however, worth suspending until someone has a good idea how to preserve the occasional theft or disastrous loss of data. good chance to add some sort of carrot that would entice players into willingly moving them around or risking them, would make for great lulz.regarding the other half, suspending the blueprints from the item inventory, that has technical merits. if i correctly understand ccp lingorm from this thread i think there is some ground to stand on. removing the blueprints from the item hangars could result in some performance boosts, in that it would reduce the number of inventory queries to a tiny fraction and possibly even the number of calls to the relevant differential tables as well. that differential data is what is important, blueprint queries should go directly to it.i'll come back later with an awesome ms paint flowchart and a photoshop concept image, perhaps that will help?"

3/20/2010,"i think a lot of people would agree that the amount of titans in game nowadays has become somewhat absurd, and if this trend is to continue, eventually fleet combat will be entire fleets of titans one shotting each other with doomsdays. i have a proposal to reverse this trend that i would like some constructive feedback on.titans were originally meant to be so expensive in mineral cost that alliances could only possibly afford one. however, this is not the case, as alliances seem to make so much money that the cost of a titan is almost trivial. what i suggest is a concept that will not be unknown to strategy gamers, and is quite apt, as a titan is a *strategic* asset. i am of course talking about 'upkeep'.i propose that to operate a titan, an alliance should need to pay a monthly upkeep cost, the price of which should be high enough to make it economically unfeasible for an alliance to maintain an increasing amount of titans and still manage to remain solvent. this cost would have to be dynamic to stop it becoming trivial to afford over time."
3/20/2010,"why don't we wait and see what until the full effects of the dominion changes have rippled out? titans and motherships are being used a lot more in much more dangerous situations than before and many more have died in the past months than in the time before the change.besides, upkeep costs for a ship that is permanently in space would be silly. what if the pilot goes afk from game?"
3/20/2010,we are aware of the effects. it failed. supporting.
3/20/2010,oh really?i saw more titans die after dominion than before.
3/20/2010,derp?
3/20/2010,"the cost would be optional, failure to pay would simply stop that titan from being able to move that month, which is just the same as the pilot being afk from eve.i don't see a problem with alliances having reserves of titans, but only being to deploy a selected few."
3/20/2010,"there have been like 5 legit titan deaths in about 3 full months of game play. that's not out of the ordinary compared to pre dominion numbers. of those 5, not counting the server **** up on pl, i think 4 were acting solo, and stupidly. that was a similar problem before the change and an increase in stupid people, or people just doing stupid things seems to coincided with an overall increase in active titan numbers in game. so it's hard to credit any of these deaths to good old fashioned kills.as for the op idea, no. i do agree that there needs to be a wait and see approach atm. hopefully, the devs will make some major changes to titan/mom mechanics that will prevent a lot of this gayness from continuing. go figure, my prediction was right. it's becoming far to common to siege towers with just super capitals and a large support fleet rather than use dreads that can be 1 shot and get stuck for 10 minutes, and warp scrammed by towers.thanks ccp, really show you thought this one out."
3/20/2010,"regardless of the circumstances, that's 10 titans lost in three months and there have been many occasions where titans were fielded, got tackled but survived due to hax, luck or skill. motherships are once more useful and 2 died just yesterday..i'm sticking to my original post, the effects still need to ripple out, people are still adjusting to the new situation."
3/20/2010,"but lets be realistic, in the same time way more new titans were most likely produced than destroyed."
3/20/2010,"that's probably true, but it's become less easy to build them with the new sov mechanics. many titans are however never used in combat, and thus are no problem for anyone."
3/20/2010,"tecnically correct but now that those wars are decided and the large blocs are at peace?with pl and goons gone, -a- being on friendly terms with atlas and it and the nc doing god knows what there is nothing left to kill the remaining 300+ titans.it will probably be years before the power structures are shaken up again which means that super-capital numbers will increase just like they did during the last lull in large scale war (between delve 1 and 2).maintenance costs on what was supposed to be rare, bordering on unique, ships is pretty much the only avenue left to stop the numbers from increasing even further.supported until ccp gets their thumbs out and makes sovereignty bills matter and discourages the vast empty spaces in null-sec sphere of influences."
3/20/2010,"to ""reduce"" number of titans ingame, simply fix the logoff timer on them.happened countless times that a titan was tackled but could logoff before enough firepower could arive to kill him in time, thanks to the hp buff."
3/20/2010,"bring more friends?say you got a well fitted shieldtanked titan with 50 mil ehp, and you tackle him. when he hits half shield, he decided '**** this', and logs off. you now have 15 minutes to kill 25 mil ehp, something that 4 motherships -or- 10 dreads can easily accomplish. and that's not even counting possible dd's of your own!"
3/20/2010,"as progression in the game continues, balancing is necessary. it would be far more practical to introduce a super expensive mobile titan killer that has the upkeep you are looking for, but does not rob players who do not yet have a titan of the chance to fly one. don't kill the dream, kill the titan."

3/20/2010,"i've made my reason clearer, and you've missed my point since i have to make it clearer and explain that i know the hulk pilots don't need help i'm saying they are jerks, many of which are no longer noobs in any sense but mine in noob systems due to being afk, poor skills, macros, etc. a new player should see those jerks and the dwindling ore, if there is any and realise 'i should go somewhere else( to mine)', since a) this system is lame with ore, and b) my tutorial agents have no more work for me. those things added up yield no need to make concord into your personal mercenary when that isn't their mandate, and as i've said before is something they don't do-punish people for theft your proposal has that change for a special reason i don't see warrants it. if i can pay concord to protect the ore i jet into space why can't i pay them to protect my wrecks, my unpiloted ship, drones, etc they are now for hire as npc mercs."
3/20/2010,"i do understand and see your point; however, you are not looking at this for the perspective of the new player. there is a lot to learn and time is needed to skill up for the move to unsafe space. yes, there are other places besides the initial system tutorial agents operate, but if you notice, i said 0.8 and higher. this is a slight adjustment for the newer player to provide some cover. even if it's only for 30 to 60 days, it's better than having to put up with the jerks (be they in a hulk fast striping, or assault ship flipping) and get some isk and encourage them to want to stay and play more. as i have said before, mercs are not always available for new players. how long after you started playing did you realize that there were mercs available, and how long before you could afford for them to come watch your back? the idea of merc corporation to protect a new player is insulting everyone here because we all know they cost too much for a new player to afford. even if the player were to hire someone in the system to look out for them, flags are not transferable...normally i would dismiss your nonconstructive bantering bringing wow into this conversation, but you are the type of person who is so far removed form the problem that you cannot see that this will allow people to play the way they want. this proposal does not force anyone to play any different that what they already try to do now, but are thwarted from by players like yourself. new players have 2 ways to raise isk, missions and mining. if you canflip the mining method, they you are the who is forcing them to play your way. sorry if that robes you from your power trip, but i want the player base to grow without people like you running them off to other games."

3/21/2010,every now and then an idea comes along that is so terrible i feel like ccp should just shut the assembly hall down to stop the crazy from spreading.this has been one of those ideas.
3/21/2010,"wrong, 9/10 of the *systems* (not holes why can people not make the distinction calling a w-space system a ""hole"" is like calling jita a ""jumpgate"") that you see are inhabited. perhaps you should look at other classes of systems if you want to profit. that or start killing people in systems that have resources you want.it seems ccp have set us w-space in such a way as to force pvp over resources. this is good. if you want a stable and secure source of income then theres plenty of those of that in highsec. w-space seems to be here for carebears with guns. either get guns or get out before you loose all your investments to an attack."
3/21/2010,"then he might well not have been there in the first place. the dd as it is now is just an extra, its the weapon dps that matters so a titan is only worth something when he's on the field shooting stuff."
3/21/2010,its funny...excellent yes more titans died and no more kill all button...which is what we wanted...however the problem remains is that the big alliances have got sooooo much cash and resources that they can build 10 for everyone they lose..im mean look at the last turnout 32 titans in a fleet - jeezzzz2 titans max allowed in system - simple
3/21/2010,oh really?i saw more titans builded after dominion than before.you see what i did here ?
3/21/2010,why do people think having lots of titans in-game is a problem? only if they are being used can they be of any advantage.

3/21/2010,"you make it sound as if only alliances pay for titans. i know several titan pilots that paid for their titans out of their own pocket, and what about those titan pilots who aren't members of space holding alliances or corps? how did they get their titan? there are a lot of those out there."

3/21/2010,"1. the learning curve involves being self-sufficient, as in no mercs necessary. if your jetcan is stolen from, use your brain--secure container.2. i'm so far removed from the game and yet u're not putting this in perspective? u're just catering to ignorance and stupidity when a simple measure of using a secure container is all that it takes to make it 100% safe.3. eve doesn't cater to either of the two and that's why it's not wow; we do not need more wow clones by implementing what u're suggesting.4. u mentioned a move to unsafe space like it's every newbie's goal. u do realize that not everyone wants to be easy cannon fodder like how u want them to play as well? oh that's right--u don't want a sandbox either--u just want it your way...again.5. technically, u're still able to jetcan so u can still play the way u want--just don't be surprised if someone finds and steals from it because u were too stupid to take precautions.6. what's stopping a nearby hulk with his throwaway <180-day alt from depositing his ore into his alt's jetcan? well that's not really helping the newbie at all when his competition, with a much faster ore rate to begin with, can mine even faster with less hauling. see what happens when u don't think? oh wait! that's what u wanted in the first place because u're in that hulk! haha... 10+ min of isk-making afk time isn't enough for u so now u want 30+ min? u don't really want to help the newbies and u know it--u just want it your way by coming up with a flimsy and utterly fail excuse because u're too lazy to make a couple of extra hauls. i'm not on a power trip; u're just lying...horribly."
3/21/2010,"well i just want to know if csm can ask to ccp devs why the old content abandoned..ccp created faction warfare than fairly abandoned.. (what they did : few news some faction items after a lot of whining from player base and some medals to caldari side than forgot it once again..)ccp created worm holes/sleepers talocans than abandoned (what they did : some drop adjustments.. than nothing.. )ccp creating tyrannis, planeteray interaction /pi i'm prtty sure after expansion and few fix patchs they will abandon that too...whats the point of those expansions just giving an apple candy for shutting up us ? half baked stuff aint good :("

3/22/2010,"if you don't fix t2 ammo you aren't fixing rails, t1 ammo dosen't play a particularily large role in long ranged weaponry unless of course a massive reduction in t2 ammo damage is proposed."
3/22/2010,"t1/t2 comparisons:spike 16k 16tiron 12k 8ttremor 20ex 12kcarbonized lead 4ex 16kaurora 20em 12tradio 20emrail ammo is balanced. on the flip side, the poor t1 arties are getting a raw deal with their carbonized lead. the explosive damage should be increased and the kinetic decreased. t1 beam ammo is also a mixed bag. whether it is a benefit or not, the damage should be split to em and thermal to match every other ammo type.this brings up the damage-related issue, resists. ccp has already tried to dissuade people from fitting broad resist modules instead of focused resists by increasing the fitting requirements for eanms. this has not accomplished much, outside frigate-sized ships, really. kinetic and thermal resists are not a weakness on any ship in the game. one potential part of fixing hybrids would be to change the base resists for all ships in the same fashion as npc ships, rather than leaving them relatively static across the races and ship types.the main problem with rails is the rails. a simple, side-to-side comparison with the other long-range guns illuminates this:1400 howitzer ii 12.807x 40 sec 48+35km1400 howitzer 10.672x 40 sec 40+35kmtachyon beam ii 5.4x 12.5 sec 53+20kmtachyon beam 4.5x 12.5 sec 44+20km425 railgun ii 3.3x 9.5 sec 58+24km425 railgun 2.7x 9.5 sec 48+24kmbased on this, i would think the fix is to better distribute the rof and damage mods. easiest would be to increase the damage mod for beams to about 7x-6x about and double the rof to about 25 sec. then the weapons are evenly distributed."
3/22/2010,"this is one of the better ideas, i have seen in a long time.too bad csm is mostly carebear so your idea would get squashed by csm and ccp."
3/22/2010,"alekseyev karrde and teadaze have both expressed an interest but really there's not much to show at this point.i'm speculating here but it would make sense for ccp to look at balancing frigate class weapons and ships at the same time as inventing the stats for t3 frigs.given that ccp's usual approach towards expectation management is to gag their employees until stuff gets to sisi i expect it's all nda at the moment and any csm leaking info would likely be shot at dawn for a week.that said it would be nice to see some participation from the csm in either this thread or the af one, let us know what they think of the issues involved and how exactly they are prodding the devs."
3/22/2010,"yes, do this."

3/22/2010,"i agree in principle, but wars are quite useless for that experience. undock in something even faintly threatening, and the plated, station-humping command ship or bs will de-aggress and dock up. assuming they're not playing in easy mode with neutral logistics, of course.the thing about wardecs that doesn't work is, they're very effective against noob corps without much experience, and virtually useless against everyone else. ""hey, wardec coming in. time to fill the shell corp / move out to lowsec / break out the npc hauler alts."""
3/22/2010,"corps of noobs and mining corps are worthless anyway. people driving them to close render all members (but the often egomaniac ceo) a service, as it is likely their next corp will be something more integrated with at least a combat wing and older players to assist the younger ones.eve is a huge food chain, while would you position yourself in the plankton role?if you just want to play with your rl friends guess what, a chat channel is enough, no need to make a corp."
3/22/2010,"dude, i *totally* suck at pvp... but if i were to get war-dec'd, i'de take the minerals i've saved from all my mission running, build a couple of ruptures/rifters from the bpc's i have, fit them with loot i've found, and go have fun for a few days.... if it stopped being fun, i would leave my corp in the capable hands of my alts, and just continue on.... i mean, c'mon... there are ways to get around this... and yeah, i pretty much suck @ pvp... but its not impossible either...."
3/22/2010,i support this 100%
3/22/2010,you're losing 100m a day? dude. take an agony class or something.
3/22/2010,it's called reckless rampages only way to get wicked fraps footage for vids
3/22/2010,"uh, well if you're deliberately choosing reckless pvp then you have to deal with the consequences."
3/22/2010,coward pvp is as fun as doing missions or mining... and a t2 fit rigged bs = 100 mill... heck sometimes i use more than 100m/day in combat boosters...and reckless pvp has nothing to do with this topic. (which is mostly do in low-sec anyway due to said clone costs)
3/22/2010,"sorry but you you are full of ****.i use combat boosters all the time, they cost 3-5 mil a pop. in a day's worth of pvp you may use 2-3 tops. that's 15 mil tops. there's no way you can reasonably spend 100 mil a day on boosters - there are unreasonable ways tho, such as using multiple improved boosters. but, if that were the case, then clone costs would have been no concern at all.i pvp in 0.0 all the time, and on some days i lose 2 battleships a day, and even so, more than 50% of the time the pod gets away. pod losses are less common than ship losses, in both low sec and 0.0to say you choose to pvp in low sec simply because of clone costs is very dishonest. clone cost may be part of that decision, but only a small part.anyway, pvp is exciting precisely because losing stuff hurts people. the cheaper pvp becomes, the less different it is from counter strike in space, the less excitement to be had."
3/22/2010,"ohh the pod usually gets away when the ship dies.. the problem then is the 25-50 jumps back to high sec thats usually bubbled. and, 4 strong boosters = 100 mill. on a 10+ hour pvp day that's not too unreasonable, especially if including the alt's consumption. also note the ''sometimes'' part as i quite obviously did not say per day. and as an example of balancing that i'm quite sure won't make this anything closer to ''counter strike in space'', 30 mill to 20-22 mill to balance the graph instead of an exponential growth. that's what this topic is about."
3/22/2010,"how can you justify spending 100 mil on several strong boosters, where 10 mil worth of standard boosters does almost same job.. and at same time be critical of 20 mil clone costs?if you like to spend big of the smallest of advantages, then don't pretend to care for spending a little extra on high sp char clone. those 71+ mil sp are just the extra edge you willingly buy.just take comfort knowing that everybody plays by the same rules, when you kill them, they hurt too. just try to kill them more often than they do you and then it's all good."
3/22/2010,"the difference is quite huge on some ships actually (up to a few hundred points of eft tank compared to standard), so for the cost of strong booster you get the effect of fitting faction/cheap deadspace mods, the boosters pay for themselves so to speak. on most common ships/setups i agree it's not though. doesn't seem like this will change though, so doubt you have anything to worry about ;)"
3/22/2010,"idk about that...after all, alliances do need to defend their assets. did u ever try stepping into their territory? oh wait, u mean pvp u can handle. well in that case, there probably isn't any doable pvp in 0.0 because news flash: it's not because of clone costs--it's because solo pvp is dead, in 0.0 and low sec. unless u don't mind spending hours roaming for a rookie ship... deal with it."
3/22/2010,i would like to see that.
3/22/2010,"the server does an awful job of detecting real network issue. try it with a corpmate watching you : unplug your cable and ask him if he saw you ewarp. the time the server will take to detect you are gone is more than enough to get you killed, network events triggered ewarp don't really protect anyone in pvp (but do a decent job in missions where the dps is usually much less)otoh ctrl-q is acted swiftly upon, making me support those issues a thousand times."

3/22/2010,"afk cloakers will just use a macro to prevent any sort of automatic afk tagging... there's no way to make them obey the rules of the game, and ccp is not going to force them to.i like the idea of an afk flag and support it."
3/22/2010,"what, are you telling me that you don't think a deathstar @ undock point of jita 4-4 is a good idea? come on, that's has got to be the best idea ever. however, i'm a bitter vet and i want eve to stay the way it is so everyone is forced to endure the same amount of misery that i've suffered all this time, so i wont support this proposal edit: omg, i can't do anything right today"

3/22/2010,you realize that:a) many titan pilots bought the titans from their own pocket and not from allianceb) that moon mining got a nice nerf bat in dominion?welcome to dominion.
3/22/2010,"dominion nerf nothing about moon mining before dominion it's was passive income, now it's also passive income. after my proposition it's always possible than some pilot buy their titan. but if some alliance must be began to work to buy their capital fleet, that will be better, because now it's stupid some alliance loose 45 capitals one days and the days after with insurance un moon mining are the money to buy all of the lost."

3/22/2010,"i'd like to see no claims bonuses added to the insurance system just like in rl. perhaps to be exhibited as a standing with the insurance corp (can't remember its name atm). similar to the way in which ratting affects concord standing & sec status.you make lots of claims you pay more. characters could have an insurance risk rating, possibly mofifiable via a skill, which decreases over time. poor rating adds +x% to insurance cost. low risk players may get a discount (possibly only applicable to t2 ships where insurance is pointless atm).this would mean that new players have insurance access if they genuinely make a mistake. insurance fraud rapidly becomes unviable as you get black listed by the insurance firm. suicide ganking while initially effective destroys your insurance risk standing as well as concord standing."
3/22/2010,"it is not the devs seeing it different, it is just very difficult to find a solution that does not afford to change big parts of the game or the game play itself. highsec pirating with 2 accounts is not a planned thing. if it wouldnt be that dramatic for audit trails the most easy way would be to track down the items with their serials and simply ban the owners for exploiting with their accounts. but well, it is just a game, and the loss of a vessel truely is sometimes dramatic, but so far the gankers also are paying customers. and ccp does not want to loose a single one. maybe that point of view changes somewhen, i would welcome it. it is more easy to handle it that way, than keep a char with cloaked bs in range and nuke the gimpos away when they attack. but again, u need to have 2 accounts for defending yourself properly. since this again generates income to ccp i guess they will consider to leave it as it is for the gain of profit.cheers"
3/22/2010,"pirates are supposed to be in the lowsec. problem is, that even an ant has too much brain to fly into lowsec. for pvp interested players 0sec is great. no faction hits, great to roam around and kill stuff. lowsec is kinda worthless since the only prey there are pirates. they dont have loot worth mentioning, they dont have the guts to fight on skill, just on numbers. lowsec is as today just a difficult part of the galaxy you have to pass when you flying into 0sec. on the other hand only skilled players pass lowsec since 0sec is the thrill. so, i guess, there isnt much left for pirates, or?by trying to exploit game engine weaknesses in form of abusing trial accounts for ganking, this is the last chance for pirating. this kind is not pvp, it is pking. pks are the kind of antisocial individualists in each community, who are not needed or wanted. it is the same discussion as trying to make psychpaths being logical necessary for all mankind. though those freaks exist.but since they are only able to attack new players and unexperienced players, it might be considered as ""existing and annoying"". if there is a solution one day, great. if not, well, i can live with it :)cheers"

3/23/2010,"a crap ton of clueless people aroudn for god's sake. you cannto balance thigns only on a 1 type vs other type of weapon. you need to find flavorrs for each type of turrets (proj. hybrids and lasers). just pumping out admage up and down solves nothing but to push the inbalance to other weapon.hybrids i think must be balanced with somethign different. what i proposed a few times. make each range of t1 ammo have 2 ammos with same range (example plutonium and am) one having a bit more damage ( bit more than now) but less tracking other less damage but quite more tracking (because you need more than 10% tracking to compensate 10% extra damage). that solves most of the issues that blasters have been suffering since web nerf.the rails are more complicated. you cannto comapre rail platforms only to the apocalypse. because its the king. if you balance to it then again arties become crap . best way to balance large rails. push locking range limit to 300 km!rails already have one advantage that most are forgetting here. they are way easier to fit than tachyosn and 1400mm on their main platforms. so if you want 425mm to have more damage then you also have to push up a bit their fitting requirements.tachyons can and should get some light rebalance. simple one is increase their cap usage. so that even an apoc cannot fight for tooo long.other more interesting one. give mega beams and tachyosn different roles. make tachyons keep current damage but drop to mega beams range. make megabeams keep current damage but go to tachyosn range. so now ammar have to choose between 2 weapon types, and not always automatically select tachyons."
3/23/2010,"yeah, but people like you just keep on coming eh? how about we keep the generalized insults aside and stick to facts and figures.great suggestion for the blasters 2.0 thread, i suggest you post that there since tracking isn't a major issue.if the apoc is so good that it cannot be used in a comparison then it needs to be nerfed until it can be, simple as that there is no 'too big to fail'. furthermore the strength of artillery is alpha and what we're proposing dosen't threaten that one bit and pushing the lock limit to 300km would be nice but is very very unlikly due to technical difficulty, also it would still leave the megathron and hyperion in a very bad way and the rokh not that much better.sure, if we start looking at a 20-30% boost to damage i think making rails harder to fit would be reasonable, though with that we'd still have to address cap usage issues and ammo usage issues, tachs and 1400s may be harder to fit but they're much easier on the consumables in situ. put some facts and figures together to show where you're going with this and you might have a reasonable alternative to boosting rail damage, though other issues would still have to be addressed."

3/23/2010,i'm sorry i did not see that before. you made my day.
3/23/2010,maybe because he isn't blinded by his isk and can realise there is an imbalance with how the high end clones increase in costs.tbh what you say just confirms to me that you still don't understand this topic.it seems theres a lot of people who really don't like solo pvp or want it to be dead. people do like playing the game differently and some don't like being forced in to blobs which make risk lower and like being more risky (solo). the costs for doing this are much higher in general and we should encourage risky behavior so everyone gets more pvp. there is a balance of course and i don't think anyone here wants wow in space.
3/23/2010,"i understand this topic very well.people want to reduce costs of pvp for high level chars. that's the bottom line.i simply happen to believe in the idea that the advantage of having high sp in combat should come at a price. and 20 mil a pop sounds very reasonable. even 40 mil per clone is still not too bad.every high level advantage in this game costs lots of isk - the difference between strong and standard booster - like the difference between 50 and 80 mil sp char. nobody forces you to use those, it's your choice."
3/23/2010,"what balance is there with ppl r starving for killmails when more potential pvpers can't pvp 'cause they can't synchronize their changing schedules to match 5+ other ppl, assuming they're willing and able to find and catch even 1 target before they have to retire for tomorrow, assuming they don't get blobbed? both sides end up losing here, whether it's dying for nothing, wasting hours of play time, or both.where's the balance when the biggest fleet always steamrolls a smaller fleet 100% of the time, setting in stone that if u have the bigger fleet, u automatically win? where's the balance in risk vs reward in the largest and probably the most important facet in this game?"
3/23/2010,"the rate of increase for combat advantage and clone cost is in no way complimentary of each other. if it was, i would run around mauling low sp ppl in my solopwnmobile bs.it should cost. we agree there. in my gd thread i've tried to relay logical arguments on what i think would be balanced. others suggest their own. what they are suggesting you don't understand is the divide between ship,fit,implant,booster,whatever costs that have a clear and distinct combat advantage and the completely different (see my first 2 sentences here) that simply having sp somehow gains you a near exponential combat advantage.i do not understand your adamant hatred towards the topic. we agree almost completely across the board but you have this idea that pursing balance (the name of the game in development) is evil and whining. some people just lash out at change i suppose?"

(to compare my low sec lowgrade slave set is now 2 years old)don't come and tell me of pvp i can't handle as everywhere in 0.0 i roam you're ''elite 0.0 pvp alliances'' either dock up or form massive blobs and still loose isk wise 90% of the time. again, this is not and issue of isk, but an issue of balance, the cost should not grow exponentially as the gains do not, the gains are diminishing in returns the higher in sp you go, i believe the clones should reflect this. that is what this topic is about!"
3/23/2010,"1. solo anywhere? most of your recent kills were certainly not solo. looks like any other pvper's killboard to me and i don't see a solo hac kill either. might wanna fix all that so u can brag about internet spaceships some more.2. what hac gang? i'm not even trained to fly one so wtf r u talking about? and what tacklers? it's only me, unless u're gonna count me as a tackler and dps or whatever... well not anymore since i don't have hours to kill roaming for 30 seconds of pvp...3. l2read--i'm not in an alliance and i don't blob either. bad enough i had to spend 99% of my time roaming but i guess u have that much time to kill anyway...4. hmm...diminishing returns as u keep training for gains...that sounds familiar... it's kinda like everything else in eve! faction mods, faction ships, and even the implants u use! obviously, if u can't handle the costs, maybe u should train an alt like other ppl suggested? i'd think ppl who've been playing for several years would've caught on by now... what's next? insurance on implants and t1-quality insurance on t2/t3/faction ships?"
3/23/2010,"i support the motion. some people are casual players, and do not whant to grind isk for hours in order to come out and have some pvp in their frigates or smth."
3/23/2010,"so all i have to do to deserve cheaper losses is call myself a ""casual player""? i would have thought that ""casual players"" would also lose fewer ships in proportion to having less time to make isk to pay for them, but now i know that what it really means is that they shouldn't have to pay the same cost for their losses as ""non casual"" players.perhaps we should just issue a ""casual player discount card"". just answer a simple poll and your discount will be determined~(1) i am not casual: 0% discount(2) i am a little casual: 10% discount(3) i am somewhat casual: 20% discount(4) i am very casual: 30% discount(5) i am totally casual: 40% discount(6) i just dont log in: 50% discount"
3/23/2010,"maybe you should learn to read... 1. i mentioned earlier that i have several pvp chars. as i'm also the one to make roams for my alliance this char doesn't solo that often. and if that's you're pvp char you really shouldn't even talk about pvp..2. i was talking about the general 0.0 alliance which you mentioned in you're other post. 3. read nr 2. and what the heck is wrong with 0 hour roams, i find that much more fun than any other activity in eve. 4. again, i have *5* pvp chars. total of 9. the lowest sp of any of those is 25 mill and that's a trader char... are you stupid? this is about balancing clone cost from cost increasing exponential to cost reflecting the diminishing returns of high sp counts! we are not exactly asking about marauders costing 5 mill etc.... get a clue and i agree with malcanis on the casual player thing. that also has nothing to do with the argument of these clone costs."
3/23/2010,"well, i find it curious that ccp provide a skill system that does not require any particular participation rate to advance, and then go and impliment a medical clone mechanic that requires us to participate as soon as possible - did they figure any casual players are only going to be around for 5 years max?i agree casual players should not be babied through the game, but i think casual players are plenty disadvantaged through lack of knowledge without putting the pressure on them to get in the game before the clone costs start to bite.---supported btw.the medical clone cost regime is:+ arbitrarily applied with no decision/control/choice from players (the most important point by a long way).+ not reflective of advantage gained, as far as i can see - although i have done no math on this, so if ccp have the figures that debunk this (i would assume they would have something) then, by all means, strike this one.+ discourages participation in 0.0.+ encourages metagaming and multi-boxing through alts:1 toon with 100m sp = 30m isk medical clone2 toons with 50m sp each = 7.8m + 7.8m = 15.6m isk total for both medical clonesalthough i'm not a fan of alts or multi-boxing, i do concede they are a part of the game; however, i do not think they should be a cheaper, and therefor an easier, option than playing with only one main toon, because they already provide a far easier way to play the game as it is.as an alternative, i like the idea forwarded by digitalcommunist in the thread linked from the op, of medical clone value determining clone cooldown periods after podding - the more you pay, the less time you wait (although i don't see ccp being too keen on an idea that keeps people from playing, but then again, that's basically what the current medical clone mechanic is doing, so maybe they'll have no problem with it )."
3/23/2010,"not supported, own a 42m sp clone myself and i like the mortality in eve."
3/23/2010,supported. it's hard to justify flying frigates when your clones cost 30m each yo
3/23/2010,"yes, stupidity is always hard to justify. ccp should not make discounts for retards."
3/23/2010,"1. u did not mention u have several pvp chars at all so which other 4 r they?2. oh i'm sry--i don't have the time to fleet much to rack up hundreds of kills for even one char so by this logic, that's why i shouldn't talk about pvp? 'cause that would mean u can't solo pvp then which is really my point in the first place?3. u find spending hours flying from system to system fun? r u just trolling now 'cause that 0 is a typo. 4. the way u talk about the supposedly unbearable costs of high sp clones when a simple measure to remedy it... think about it--if u're not getting returns that r worthwhile to u, why would u dig yourself a deeper hole by continuously billing yourself a higher clone cost? so if u can't afford it, use an alt. not my fault u're too stupid to adapt.5. the solo/0.0 pvp thing may have nothing to do with the clone costs but it was merely in response to what u stated that ppl whine that there's no 0.0 pvp."
3/23/2010,pathetic and sad.not supported.
3/23/2010,well. seems like my doubts have been already addressed and this idea does seem reasonable.
3/23/2010,wow has something like this.you would get something you would fit onto your key chain or keep somewhere safe at home. every time you wanted to log into wow you would press a button and the password would only be valid for roughly 15mins i think. it would be a 8 digit long number.it looks something like this
3/23/2010,"it would be nice to have this at certain stations but not as a blanket thing every time i wanted something.also even if the container system were improved ( i had no idea the pw could be retrieved so easily lol, whats the point?) it doesn't protect rigged and fitted ships, which, for me at least, is where the vast majority of my wealth resides."
3/23/2010,"clickable pin pad! yes please!allow everybody to set their pin of 4-6 digits, and allow them to set what and where they want locked down (specific station hangars, all station hangars, corp window, wallet, market transactions, etc). 5 failed pin entry attempts in a x-hour period will send an e-mail to the account owner and lock the pin pad for y hours. corporation ceos can see whether their directors, accountants, <other sensitive jobs> have a pin set to their corp and wallet windows.this is a very smart way to go about helping us help us keep our accounts and assets more secure, without babysitting us. most unauthorized eve account use is a result of phishing and keylogging. the clicking-only pin pad makes keylogging completely ineffective, and the locking of the pin pad and notification of the account owner upon multiple failed entries makes bruteforcing impossible.(also, the point of container passwords is so that other people can't access the container when it's in space or what have you... i don't know why you can password-protect a station container..... maybe station owners can access visitor assets?)"
3/23/2010,"even if i call out on ts or in alliance chat that i'm afk anyone who logs in after that or a friend not in my alliance won't know i'm not there unless someone tells them. like the voice icon that shows on your pic if you have joined a channel's voice chat, ccp could also add a small icon to show over your portrait that symbols afk. /me takes a bath after agreeing with -a-. :p"
3/23/2010,"people log out when afk? and what's coming this summer? i need to do some reading, i guess.supported, though. i'd even go with a an auto-afk thing where the game knows you've not touched your mouse/keyboard and sets an indicator so your friends know you're afk. of course you can turn that off, if you prefer."
3/23/2010,options on esc screen - turn status light blue - simples...
3/23/2010,have player go into 'delayed mode' (just like the channel delayed mode works) after xx minutes.not in corp/localas with al issues live's more complex so this is the short version.
3/23/2010,second
3/23/2010,small idea for missionsthis is not so much of a nerf but a change.as we know it takes pirates resources ect to sneak past faction police build outposts and smuggling routes for some people's favorite goods. first try is always free. anyway these routes and outposts are not numerous in high sec same goes for about any mission. only so many drones can become rouge in a time frame. pirates can only get things setup so fast and so on.what my proposal is to set a mission pool that an agent can draw from. so lets say a single agent like in motsu can only give out worlds collide x amount of times during y duration than it is exhausted. the agent wont get informed about new possible missions until y. so like belts high sec would be the easiest to clear out than low sec finally 0.0 missionsflame or support away.
3/23/2010,supporting myself
3/23/2010,"so basically, you are saying that you are getting tired of running the same missions over and over, right?if that's the case, then yes, i think that the randomizer could use an update. missions such as disgruntled employee should be once in a blue moon or something like that.nobody's going to like my idea completely, but i would like to see missions take longer, such as the blockade, where fleets and fleets of battleships keep coming in constantly for like 20 or more waves. i like killing lots of stuff, so i think it would be fricken awesome to see missions like that. instead of doing the same missions that we have over and over, with a ****ed off employee, why not get more combat in the missions? let the npc's flow!edit: this would be like a ""filler"" mission, but maybe optional for those who don't like long missions. there just don't seem to be enough npc's in each pocket..."
3/23/2010,lets look at it this way. we have lets say for a given agent we have 5000 nemies abound 1/5 that can be drawn from lets say 3 days. once the agent gives out 5000 of that mission he or she wont give it out anymore. so if the agent is so farmed he or she will stop giving the top end missions ect. if you still want top end just simple move to another agent and wait for the next time the agent gets an update lets say every monday and friday something like that.numbers would need to be played with.idea is to put a little competition between runners. maybe add a few more high sec agents ect to make up for the change. if you don't like to move around a lot go to an agent that is used less. so lower ql since there would be more missions from that agent that are not being done. so compete on the ql 18 or 20 agent in high sec or the 16. idea of a few extra agents there in high sec would be there to makeup for the change in how missions worked maybe add some more low sec/ 0.0 too
3/23/2010,"you are walking on the very edge of ""mission farming"" hell.all we need now is people spamming the agent after d.t. much like plex's and exhausting them until such time conditions are met.unless you mean otherwise... your implications do not indicate so.i'd be more inclined to make sure missions do not repeat within the last 3 to 5 missions and not so much exhausted conditions."
3/23/2010,"i'd support this but it would be prudent to say that it should be limited so that poss can not be placed on the same grid space as another pos, station, gate, belt, or planet. they can only be placed in open space that hasn't been claimed yet or on a moon thats not claimed. really u would think that this would be common sense.the reason i support this is because i would really like to see someone actually work to find a pos instead of just scanning around a planet and saying ""hmm, thers some structures here. i should warp cloaked to the moons and find out which one it is."" instead of finishing that scan. on a side note poss would need to be changed so they can be scanned down with some varying difficulty depending on the poss size.to wiersma: you really need to put more detail into your proposals."
3/23/2010,players can not perform any form of remote repair on a players ship if they are not logged in. un-piloted ships can be remote repaired.edit because i fail:pr0s: no more capital ships getting remote repaired till they disapear because they got in over their head.cons: i would say if someone had a legitimate disconect would suck for them but they could simply log back in and start getting remote repaired again.
3/23/2010,"i am sorry, but you have to explain that.and congratulations to your new alliance."
3/23/2010,"yes, please. that is really annoying. please fix it."
3/23/2010,updated
3/23/2010,"as sokratesz said ""now that is something i could be in favour of.""p.s.: richard, there is this little checkbox ""check here if you want to give your support to the idea/discussion going on"", you might want to hit that. ;)"
3/23/2010,if a pilot logs of the ship is still associated with it. thats something totally different from repping an empty ship in space.
3/23/2010,"irrelevant. why should it be possible to shoot a ship when it's not possible to rep it? as i said, i am in full support of a ship that's tackled never disappearing from space (until it's no longer tackled, and then maybe give it a 30-second timer... or something else just long enough that it can be retackled). if that were the case, the logoff-so-i-dont-get-dead tactic will be completely neutralized in such a way that's not some mindless nerf and actually makes sense. removing the ability to rep a logged-off ship while retaining the ability to shoot it is utterly mentally handicapped.the problem that's being addressed here is a legitimate one... the proposed solution, however, is not."
3/23/2010,"yay! i made a suggestion that was not ""full r3t@rd!"" and got a thumbs up from darius mclever and hopefully a thumbs up from sokratesz soon. my work... is done."
3/23/2010,next goal: posting the proposal without editing? :p *scnr*
3/23/2010,this ^^. can shoot it but not repair it? wtf?
3/23/2010,"supported, as long as the ship is piloted and the pilot logged off. empty ships should still be repairable."
3/23/2010,"this is a serious navigational hazard placed approximately 15km from the gate in line with most of the other gates in system. it's bad enough that one is consigned to flying a freighter for certain tasks, doubly bad when this station seems to exert some sort of magnetic resonance field and 50% of the time when i jump in i get stuck in the geometry of the damn station and have to spend 5 minutes extracting myself ;_;...any chance it could be removed or at least 'shifted' to say 20km behind the gate?"
3/23/2010,how about just move it to 100km from the gate?
3/23/2010,"posting in a larkonis gate thread.(more seriously, though, supported. scenery is supposed to look pretty, not block travel)"
3/23/2010,move it
3/23/2010,iseewhatyoudidthere.jpgyeah. supporting my own thread.
3/23/2010,these kind of objects bring knowledge of local conditions into the pvp equation.gates are different sizes and sometimes have objects in awkward positions.if they were all the same size with no objects around them it would be too homogeneous.
3/23/2010,you really need to upgrade the class of wh you live in cause after living in a cl3 myself for a few months i can assure you there were about 3-4 times noncorpies came in our wh and only 1 of them resulted in a kill and that kill would have never happened if it wasn't for me paying someone to take down a pos from someone who stole from me. the higher classes of wh are as empty as they ever were you simply need to look for them in low sec and 0.0.
3/23/2010,"i live in a c5, i havnt had anyone come in ours so far and iv been living in it for around a month now, and as for connection wh we have had around 1/10 having someone in it and even then if you have enough guys or a cap ship u just get rid of the hole, easy. so yes my point is move to a high class instead off sticking with the pus*y areas :)"
3/23/2010,"b/c so many baby titans have perished since dominion, right? more titans and moms are being produced now than at any given point before the dominion patch.while the patch gave these ships the roles they so desperately needed, ccp did not take into account that it would only be a matter of a year before all 0.0 fleet warfare is a cluster of titans and motherships battling it out. if you thought the whines were bad when eve began its trip down the path of capitals online...wait til the game turns into super-caps online. edited for support"
3/23/2010,you know hes got a point there....
3/23/2010,i have never sale so much bpc of capital parts. if that continue that will be posssible to see some fight with more 200 super capital on the field.some big alliance now began to build more than 10 mothership per months.for me they are really a big problem.
3/23/2010,"in other words: alts online, since super caps pretty much forces you to use alts.dont think this is perfect solution, but something needs to be done."
3/23/2010,if you think something needs to be done but do not agree with this proposal - then why are you supporting it?
3/23/2010,something is better than nothing.
3/23/2010,"in before godwin.that's what germany thought when it voted ****** in during the economical crisis of the thirtiesin after godwin.if you want something to be done about it, write up a proposal that you agree with rather than supporting some ****ty rant like this."
3/23/2010,i would be for this:a players ship can not be remote repaired if they are not logged in.carriers rring titans till they disapear is total bull****.
3/23/2010,now that is something i could be in favour of.
3/23/2010,"bull****, why shouldn't i be able to remote rep a ship sitting in space? it doesn't matter if it has a pilot. what we need is to make a ship that's tackled not disappear. then while you have the titan tackled, you shoot at the rring carrier until he pops or goes away and then go back to killing the titan. also, the way i understand cynos is that you can still jump when you're tackled.... maybe make it so that you can't jump when you're being pointed by a scrambler. these two mechanics would greatly reduce the use of supercapitals, and we wouldn't need these stupid upkeep cost rules put forth by people who don't like having their carriers and battleships one-shotted by a roaming titan."
3/23/2010,"well any counter you put in shouldnt mean ""less use of the ship"" those ships had been pos blingbling for long enough. one could argue about tackled ships not disappearing. (sounds like a fair deal aswell), but jumping to a cyno should be only blocked by bubbles. (you cant point supercaps anyway)about headshotted carriers and battleships .... with the locking time of a titan, you should atleast be able to get your battleship out. and most carriers that got one shot did either do station games or were travel without support. no sorry for them. :)"
3/23/2010,"some would say that all capital ships already have a maintenance cost attached to their use in the form of ice products consumed through out their use.a titan that never jumps and never uses it jump portal or doomsday, doesnt cost money to maintain, but then isnt really a huge threat to anybody either.i would only support a maintenance cost for a titan if there was a maintenance cost for all ships.provisions and reactor fuel built from npc/planetary resources that are consumed per hour at various rates dependent on ship class."
3/23/2010,i am all for maintnance cost for all capitals and super-caps.
3/23/2010,i would like to propose ccp make a module for pos' that allows storage of jump clones.. kk thanks
3/23/2010,buy this?
3/23/2010,"that is exactly my point, i am not and will never be a miner. hence, i will never have or ever think of buying/training a rorq. the mothership used to fill this role nicely for strickly pvp minded individuals and is now gone.. add pos module.i aprove this message."
3/23/2010,i hear you can build your own outposts out in null security space which are kind of like the npc stations in empire. they can have cloning facilities too.
3/23/2010,"i agree with idea. though a titan can fill the role a mothership had in this (carrying pvp fitted ships), this would be an interesting way to keep skirmish fights in hostile space interesting. ...also, posting with un-tagged alts is lame jade.updated to show support*"
3/23/2010,can you build them in wh space?
3/23/2010,fail? you can not clone jump from/to wormhole space. try again. ;)
3/23/2010,now it's very difficult to found some good use for the carrier. you have the possibility to make some remote and that all. mine new bonus will be on the capital ship lvl50 % bonus on the capital neutralizeri don't would like to put some value on the capital neutralizer ( ccp will make that better than me).
3/23/2010,"first problem ... there are no capital energy neutralizer. and they would be just overpowered if introduced. especially with your 50% amount bonus.atm smaller ships got some chance to manage cap under cap war pressure. then you would just one volley their cap.if you want insane cap warfare, bring an archon and a talisman bhaalgorn with all neuts."
3/23/2010,"i propose a new module who could be fitted on bs and sup.remote cloaking devicerecalibration delay will be apply on remoted ship, scan resolution malus on both ships (remoter and remoted).nice to set traps"
3/23/2010,no.
3/23/2010,i'd use it to shut down other ships.
3/23/2010,"if youre a miner like me you generally one day yearn for the chance to grab a rorqual and along with your fleet of barges decimate system after system of their belts......however the rorqual while a grand vessel could use improvement on the following ideas 1 indy core  why is it that a capital ship that lacks any hard points or complex fighter drone control systems that also diverts in engine power, needs fuel to run assembly lines. i could understand if the ship was super powering a capital mining laser or repairing a ship 200k away but for lack of a better word its just powering up an assembly line, or 4 to be specific. while re-routing all the power of a giant engine core to said lines. in short i dont think the rorqual should need fuel to switch modes. 2 mode switching  ok this is more of a why does it work that way kind a thing. why is it that the ship must remain in build mode for 300 seconds and then stop? i think it would be cool if the ship worked more like cloaking does. i.e. if i move to an ore field and hit the indy core. ship comes to a stop and after a minute finishes its transformation. should i want to go i hit the module again and in 1-2 minutes im back in ship mode. any ore not fully processed would be ether lost or placed back in the hold (note: transformation times guessed by watching a youtube vid of the ship changing. could be extended to compensate for the suggestion i have made)3 ore compression  to me having to have a bpo for every ore type seams rather silly. i know there generally cheap but it seams like such a hassle to make sure you have every bp or what not, and its not like the rorqual is easy to turn around should you forget something. why not change it to something more like the following. when the rorqual changes to build mode it gains 4 low slots that contain 4 irremovable grinders in a similar fashion to how the zephyr always has that proto type probe launcher. to be fair to those who have collected all the ore bpo simply change them to skill books each skill book covers a ore type (such as veldspar) and each type covers all of the variants when lvl 3 is reached i.e. industrial - veldspar grinding lvl1 allows grinding veldspar, -5% grin timelvl2 allows grinding concentrated veldspar -5% grind timelvl3 allows grinding dense veldspar -5% grind timelvl4 -5% grind timelvl5 -5% grind timeonce you have these skills you can right click on one of the grinders and load an ore into it of any type you know,a grinder can hold up to 250k worth of ore, just like you would with ammo into weapons. once loaded you click on it like any gun and after its cycle ore is removed from the grinder and a compressed ore is dropped into your cargo hold."
3/23/2010,"so i'd need to train both veld refining and veld grinding. no thanx.the fuel consumption for industrial core is minimal, it even makes compression of empire ore cost effective.no mode switching? but it looks so cool.....the blueprints are a hassle especially because the large number will lag a rorq corp hanger to death.not sure that removing them and replacing with yet another skill fixes anything tho."
3/23/2010,we never see rorqual in belt cause the comparison between proximity advantage/isk risquing/tanking is not favorable.to rebalance this i propose a new additional bonus :+ 10% shield boost bonus per level when in deployed mode (per level of cap indus ships skill)this will simply give almost the same bonus as one shield boost amplifier. it's more logical (fuel consummation and immobility when deployed) and will encourage those ships to go out of pos.
3/23/2010,o/ pantorusno supported because that will be not a big difference and the role of rorqual is bonus and compression not tanking.i prefere to have the possibility to make the compression from the ore bay.and if it's possible to increase them at 500k that would be perfect
3/23/2010,or maybe a :+5% capacitor recharge rate bonus per level when in deployed mode

3/23/2010,"came up with a new ship idea over the week end and figured i would try it out. the electronics superiority ship is the next line of electronic warfare vessels to hit the battle fields but in a unique way. unlike current electronic warfare ships the ees forges ahead in information gathering and distribution and fleet supportive measures the ship itself is a bs sized platform but lack any real firepower capability, its primary strength is in helping fleets and performing tasks that regular ships simply dont have the ability to do. though base stats very each ess has 8 high slots, 6, medium, and 6 low. with each ship varying with 4 slots weapon-able i.e. caldari would have 4 missiles, ammar would have 4 turrets etc. the ess is also fairly faster than most bs at a rate thats nearly twice that of regular battleships. it is however not able to field the same level of tank that regular bs carries. each ess is capable of fitting special ess only modules each one is listed below.subspace relay scanner- passive the subspace relay scanner is a ship system that equips a very large sensor array specifically set up to locate every ships beacon and link it in a local network thus when a ess is in systems that dont normally have a local channel one is provided. this system also functions in systems that normally or used to have working networks but for one reason or another they have been shut down (module for it low/null sec has its local channel removed)tactical defence analyzer- activethe tda is a module that runs a structural scan on the targeted ship to determing its current defensive capabilities. it then encodes a set of instructions over the fleets com system that shows up as a shield icon on the right side of the ship in question. this icon shows a color that indicates the targets current resistants level that is the lowest. if the target ship has no damage at all this shield has a bubble around it. as an example a ship has a resistance of 50 em and 75 everything else for shields and 20 thermal and 50 everything else for armour. when scanned a shield icon with a bubble around it appears to the right of the ship and is the colour blue (for em), after sufficient beating the ship shields drop and the bubble around the icon is removed and the icon itself turns red (for thermal) (red= thermal, blue= em, white=kinetic, yellow=explosive)tactical offence analyzer  active the toa is a module that runs a detailed scan on the targeted ship to find out what ammo is currently loaded and firing. this information is displayed as an icon to the left of the ship and like the defence analyser is color coded. this icon displays as a circle for short range and a filled circle for long range. like all ess analyzers this information is displayed to the whole fleet that the ess resides in.system reserve analyzer  activethe sra is a module that scans the ships power reserves and displays it as an icon below the ship; the icon is similar to the capacitor read out aboard a pod but simpler for easy display. like all ess analyzers this information is displayed to the whole fleet that the ess resides in.action analyzer  active the action analyzer scans the target ship and determines what if any none weapon effects the ship is producing / receiving. if the target is webbing a friendly it would show up as a small red icon above the ship, if it was being webbed it would show a green icon. like all ess analyzers this information is displayed to the whole fleet that the ess resides in.directional control projector - passivethe directional control projector is a high end processor that takes in all the fleets nav data and renders it real time for all ship in system, the result is that any grid a fleeted ship resides in appears on screen as a warp-able location that is visible from any point in system right clicking the icon for that point can give you a warp to location text or tell you whos there."

3/24/2010,"comparing close turrets i see blasters need love:lasers - they can deliver good dps at very flexible range. for example medium pulses can shoot from 6km to 23km at their optimal.auto cannons - does not eat capacitor, have tiny pg requirements, very good tracking, switchable damage type. it is very painful to hit in resist weakness. t2 long range ammo allow to shoot near 20km for medium ac. high speed of minmatar ships allow to dictate tactics.blasters - consume cap, fixed damage type (kinetic and thermal are not resist holes), tiny optimal+faloff (even with null it is like pulse with high damage close ammo), tracking speed is like ac. for example about medium ac and blasters: 1nd and 2nd tier ac even faster comparing appropriate blaster analog (180mm vs electron, 220mm vs ion). it is strange, is it?so what have i missed? oh... gallente drones. do you realize it is limited use? do not play with eft dps figures. drones need time to reach target, they have speed (sometimes target is faster then drones), they have hp (it means they can die), not only gallente ships have drones.so. gallente have largest dps only in eft. all disadvantages of blasters do not cost this dps difference.my proposal:- blasters should have more damage and more tracking speed. (caldari should gain less blaster bonuses because their ships are faster, see bellow)- gallente ships should have more basic speed. i will explain why. gallente ships are armor tanked. so plates eat agility, armor rigs eat speed - how can slow ship to reach optimal? minmatar ships are fast, caldari are faster because they do not need armor rigs and plates, amarr ships have more chances to deliver their dps due their flexible ammo range + instant change."

3/24/2010,because unlike other ships carriers and super-carriers only weapons (excluding ecm) are drone-type weapons. next to that they are supposed to be logistical platforms used for fleet warfare. they can repair other ships yet have no capability to easily repair their defensive capabilities except exposing their weapons to destruction in space. this doesn't make sense from a gameplay and a ship designers point of view.
3/24/2010,"a great concept imo. some interesting ideas too. i like the idea of turning low-sec into the seedy underworld of new eden. make real mini-proffessions out of drug dealing and smuggling, prostitution, and gambling. the serpentis are supposed to be the drug smugglers of eve, how about adding some serpentis npc drug labs in low-sec where you can take drug courier missions. even negotiating larger buy quantities for lower unit prices for greater profits at higher risk.perhaps even throw in some proper eve-casino's. it would be awesome to lose a couple of billion isk to someone inside, then wait outside for them to undock and gank the ****er!prostitution, i dunno how that would work but im sure someone has a good idea."

3/24/2010,i can nothing but support this thread.here a few facts comparing the supercarriers:nyx: 35mio ehp with slaveset and a bit complex stuff.aeon: 38mio ehp with slaveset and a bit complex stuff.wyvern: 25mio with lots of pith x-typ stuff and 15k dps tank for 11minhel-armor: 15mio with about the same complex stuff.hel-shield: 15mio with lots of pith x type and 9k dpstank for 11min.hope that makes clear how much inferior the hel is. with 30k dps it will take 19min to take down a solo nyx . for a hel it only takes half and the 9k selfrep doesnt help ****.the main problem is that the slave set has a effect on a supercarrier while the crystal set does not.hel needs a balance between shield and armor amount and the proposed 7/6/6 slot setup.regards numinos
3/24/2010,"comparing the nyx and hel (as neither have a resist bonus and the same number of tanking slots)calling bull sh*t on this one (not taking gang boni into account) here, the only way to get 36 mil ehp out of a nyx is with more than 'a bit' of complex stuff, you require a quad x-type hardener set and 2 a-type eanms.i just plugged in a hel fit into eft and was able to pull out 26mil ehp with a similar resistance profile to the nyx (in fact each cap shield rep on it is around 20% more efficient than a crar on the nyx), it also aligns 50% quicker and is twice as fast. you can get the alignment time down to <10 seconds if you forgo pdus (at the cost of 4 mil ehp) for i-stabs (crazy i know!). also who the hell fits a local rep on a milf these days?if fact i think the issue here is more to do with slaves than the slot layout. however, you have the advantage of being able to use nomads on the shield tanked milfs (crazy i know!) and you can squeeze more effective rr out of shield tanks than armour tanks. i'd be more inclined to get slaves nerfed for caps or crystals buffed than giving in to the demands of the 'must armour tank all capitalz' crowd."
3/24/2010,i actually havent thought about going passive shield and armor tank the same time. ure right that pushes it up to 24mio ehp. but u need all slots pressed full with complex stuff to reach only 2/3 of the nyx. the nyx on the other hand has still all its medslots free for caprecharge or ew or whatever.and i dont really see aligntime and topspeed as the advantage in a badass capfight.

3/24/2010,can you imagine what providence would be like if you could have multiple player-built stations in a system?answer: my worst ****ing nightmare.not supported.
3/24/2010,i don't think providence would have been any different than now. with 50 dreads a station is only 1 siege cyckle and with the upcoming insurance changes dreads will get even cheaper. so supported.
3/24/2010,"no, it really hasn't. as was said, it takes several days already. claiming that additional stations in a system wouldn't make it more difficult to flip is just plain silly.you hit the nail on the head right there. in between each attack, caps warp off to a safe pos. so, again, i point out that even if a single station can be flipped during 1 siege cycle, the actual attack takes more than an hour. multiply that by a dozen stations. add an hour for formup. add an hour to get everything in place. add some cushion time and you can't do it in a day. while you are taking down one, defenders can easily be messing with another one.one important thing to remember is the idea of hitting a station just before downtime so you don't have to worry about it being re-flipped. if there were multiple stations, you would have to have 50 dreads and 50 carriers. repping a station back up so it can't be flipped by a wing of bombers isn't a minor feat.bottom line - the more stations in a system, the more static sov will be."
3/24/2010,"the additional difficulty is trivial. and it's far, far less than the difficulty of taking those same 12 stations in 12 different systems.+1 station in the same system = add 1-2 siege cycles per station reinforce cycle. call it an hour tops.+1 station in another system with another ihub = add 3 more station reinforce cycles and 2 more ihub reinforce cycles. call it another week, minimum.yeah... an hour vs a week. which to choose... so difficult..."
3/24/2010,"dreads warp to pos when stuff is reinforced and they do not have any more reason to sit around in space. not inbetween warping between locations that need shooting. at least in my experience. we go to system, drop sbu's, then dreads go to ihub, rf it then after they exit siege they warp to station and rf it. if there would be few more stations then they would be warping there and rf'ing those also. reason why taking a system takes several days is rf timers, not hardship of ganking few hundred mil hp structure or two. from your replys tho i get impression that you might have not been involved in sov warfare recently. if you are then my apologies - in that case our game experience differs quite a lot. you do raise a fair point tho - at what moment will the station be reinforced so it can't be repped up again when there is many stations in the system. then again all this fuss about 'so hard sov warfare' is relatively easy to cirumenvent by just letting owner of the system point one of the stations as 'capital' of the system and making all stations in the system flip when capital station flips. exactly the same sov warfare system as currently just with multiple stations in the system."
3/24/2010,"if putting multiple outposts in a single system would make it too difficult to take over, then you simply need a mechanism where you only have to conquer a single outpost, which would make the rest flip to the attacker when it falls. let's say, a system capital upgrade that must be installed on an outpost before multiple outposts can be deployed. if the outpost with the capital upgrade falls, so does the system. no need to go attacking the others."

(yes i can calculate this myself however, with a wife and 2 young kids i like to be able to actually do something with my game time that doesnt involve sitting down and calculating returns on efforts for the members of my corp.)potential issues:1. may be non trivial to organise as you are increasing the lookups on the database, something that the need for speed initiative wont like much2. additional workload in addition to point 1. also requires touching on the roles for corporations that has not been retouched since i started playing several years ago. adds a further level of complexity on role management which may not be well understood.3. additional efforts which will compound the code change effects and the risk with implementing this.conclusionsmy personal preference as a player is 3 as i get the most bang for my buck with this however i am enough of a realist to be very happy with option 1. it massivly simplifies corporate management and returns for members for those corporations that give a damn about these sort of things. granted there are organisations that quiet frankly dont give a damn about rewarding their members other than to buy stuff  and do more stuff with it. however i would anticipate that the concept of setting out a reward structure for your active members is likely to increase the use of this functionality as it would breed loyalty to your corporation and (theoretically) increase the amount of money people are willing to invest in the corporation. granted it does nothing about taxing miners, or loot drops or market traders but those are issues i do not think can be addressed as easily as this.i would like to thank dek kato and tellenta for their responses on my first draft of this subject.(supporting of your own topic ftw?)[edit: there is more than one proposal, proper proofreading only works after coffee]"
3/24/2010,"i wouldn't mind this, but i think very few would use it, and as such, it is not worth the developer time required to code it, especially since you can allready keep track of this on your own by simply making an api program that pulls that data from the high sec api of someone with access to view all wallet divisions and then calculate it. you'd just have to store who is in which group/wing in a database and then each transaction to the master wallet from from that person gets added to the group total when the api is run."
3/24/2010,"the problem with the feature request is that it is highly specific to your corp structure. i expect that the number of corps that would use these features is fairly small, but the amount of developer time needed to impliment them is likely to be large.it sounds like most of what you want can be calculated automaticly using a custom application that get the data it needs from the api. you could then copy-paste amounts to be transfered from your custom application to the game client to complete the needed isk transfers. the api can even access corp roles/titles, so even wing assignments can be automated."
3/24/2010,"this isn't highly specific. there are many other cases where it would be useful for certain automated payments (read taxes) to go into a wallet of your choice. for instance, a corp op where all proceeds go into a certain fund. rather than having to go back through the master wallet and do maths to separate out the amount that should go into the fund after the fact, it would be far easier to funnel the funds into that wallet for that day (or however long). additionally, it can be useful to have funds automatically divided among different wallets constantly. it could be useful to have a %2 tax going to a ship fund, a %4 tax going to pos management, a 4% tax going to alliance fees, etc...from a corp management perceptive, it would be nice to have better control over automatic distribution of corp funds. plus, it would give corp members better oversight of their leadership. it would no longer be really easy to siphon funds out of a corp. i mean, people do it, make them actually have to put some effort into it."
3/24/2010,"you already have the tools needed for this; api access to transaction logs, etc.what you are asking for is highly specialized features that can't really be expected to be done without outside tools."
3/24/2010,it can be tracked by corp leadership with outside tools. this is not the same as being taken care of in a transparent fashion by the game.
3/24/2010,"if isotope cost and/or volume was increased substantially then perhaps that would applywe see an approximation with dreads and the stront they use (expensive+cargo hungry).maintenance cost does not necessarily have to be isk based, making it a time sink by requiring more logistics to move stuff makes for a similar drawback. benefit is that a volume/isk increase, rather than just isk, incorporates a sort of scaling on its own since the fuel needed to move 20-30 titans/moms would require loads of hauling = man-power .. might actually be a better solution altogether since moving stuff can not be bought or printed in empire."
3/24/2010,i find it funny sok has zero reply for my well thought out argument.
3/24/2010,"the main problem of t3 ships are that you receibe 18m for the insurance and the ship cost 300m with 5 subsistems and the ship. but it's so funny because 200m of this 300m go out only in melted nanoribbons... the t3 ships are a really good ships, but it's a cruiser, just a cruiser. 300m for one cruiser and 200m only in 40 melted, it's should be rebalanced.only if ccp change how often the people obtain melteds and the price of melteds change between 5m to 1m, the ships'll cost 125m not 300m, only with this. 125 it's a bit more affordable for one cruiser. and it's still more expensive than t2 ships."
3/24/2010,uh... that's the point.it's supposed to be expensive.might want to get a bandage for that foot btw.
3/24/2010,prices are defined by players. not by ccp.
3/24/2010,"there is no such problem because no one of devs ever told that t3 ships must have insurance. want insurance - fly t1.prices are defined by players, not ccp. so if players are paying 300m for ""cruiser"", it means that its not just a cruisers but a very, very good ships compared even to t2 hacs.ship will not cost 125m, because its price are determined by market demand and not nanoribbons' drop. if you boost drop of nanoribbons, then others kinds of salvage will get price high.yes, you can boost drop of all components, but no one ever told that t3 must have price like t2.when was the last time when you looked at t2 hacs price in jita?"
3/24/2010,the op is based on so many false assumptions that it's hard to know where to even start.so i'll simply say - this is working as intended. move along.
3/24/2010,troll or ignorant.take your pick.
3/24/2010,"i don't think so, if 90% of the ship's price is contained in a single resource out of three dosens. the drop rates need to be configured so that they are more even. currently, all sleeper salvage except nanoribbons is useless."
3/24/2010,"this might be true. it seems to be a large bottleneck in the supply chain. however, i think this is the case throughout most production in eve. perhaps not to this extreme, but there are rare materials that make up a large part of the cost of all ships. perhaps the cost should be better distributed (by making some other drops more rare and making this more common), but the end result shouldn't change. if anything, t3 cruisers should be a bit more in price."
3/24/2010,"ccp can change the price, what happend with the last patch and the technetium? so many t2 materials grew up his price. if you change the drop, the offert i'll be more than now, and the price fall.ok you want the same price than now, but it's unsuall that all the price it's for only 1 item, like one says ""it's a bottleneck"", for me it's ok if ccp rise the drop of melted and fall the other drops, but it have more sense that all the salvage items cost more or less the same. not this differences, 20k isk it's the normal price, compared with 5m you can undertand that it's unbalanced.this is not a post for trolling, i only ask if can be possible to balance the t3 prices. i read the coments and i dont undertand completely, are you agree or not??and ok it's not a good example the insurance and the price, but no one use t3 ships for pvp... it's a fail for ccp, work so hardly for make exposition ships... strategic cruiser is not a navy cruiser that it's exclusive.i hope i explain better now :)"
3/24/2010,that a fact?yeah.... right....
3/24/2010,"with a mix of bad english and crazy ideas you have lost me. i wondnt want a increased drop in nano ribbons anyway, yes it is a bottleneck, but it makes it so the prices stay at a reasonable level so wh's are worth staying in and/or the market isnt flooded with cheap t3 ships. if you want cheaper go for a t2 or even better a t1..."
3/24/2010,"yes, it only makes sense the tech is there on a ship why not a player owned station clone vat bay is only 4k m3 that would fit in almost any t1 hauler's hold."
3/24/2010,"scenarios1) i have a ship with damaged mods, i want to contract it, i cant..fair enough so ill repair it... however its stuck in an outpost that i no longer have access to, so i cant repair it, or now even sell it so its stuck there forever.2) i have lots of items, lots damaged, i want to sell them all and contract it, same as above...can we please add either a new skill or a way to remotely repair damaged items, so we just dont have our stuff stuck in stations...ta."

3/24/2010,"if you're having problems findings a good use for a carrier, you're either really new to flying it or really not doing something right..."
3/24/2010,yep now the carrier will began to be only logistics.depending on the fitting of your carrier but must of the time one shot by titan.you tank during about 1 minutes some mothership.now if you use 10 carriers again one mothership it's not sure you can kill them.yep they are some problem with capital now.perhaps the good way will be.titan same then nowmother same then nowdread same then nowcarrier same (there are only the carrier can fit the capital repair module or cap transfer)remove all insurance on the capital
3/24/2010,"a triage carrier can turn an impossible to win fight into a fight with no losses, or very quickly rep up a pos so it can be stronted.a pantheon carrier fleet can easily tank an equal number of dreads while still taking the impossible to rr dreads down.standard old style combat fitted carriers with neuts and smartbombs in addition to their rr can easily hit sub caps with their drones, while keeping hostile drones off themselves with smartbombs and tackle get neuted down.on stations carriers can provide extreme amounts of support for a fleet without ever taking aggro, so it can re-dock at any time. 5 highs for rr, 4-7 mids for remote sb and eccm, 4-7 lows for a minimal tank so it can take sentry gun fire and for cap recharge. also enables you to instantly switch ship and bring the most suitable ship to the next fight.logistically, they have the best jump range, and despite the cargo space nerf, they can still take quite a bit of stuff and allot of ships.in short, you're a ****** and should stfu."
3/24/2010,you really dont know what you are talking about.
3/24/2010,it's only now you have some hotdrop with 5 ou 6 super capital.and this super capital use ring capital remote.hp buffer + capital remote on this super capital is too much. the idea will be to remove the possibility to use capital remote (shield or armor) on the super cap. the buffer is enough
3/24/2010,"hot-dropping 5-6 supercaps is a choice based on wallet sizes and the roles of the ships. as pointed out, putting triage carriers or a pantheon fit on the field works just as well for hotdrops.[/thread]"
3/24/2010,"so, what i am getting is the op bought/built a carrier and wants it to have an ""i win"" button. not even titans get an i win button. if you have ever neuted a ship with a few large neuts, you would know that a rack of large neuts can finish off most ships so fast and completely that it is bordering on being overpowered. if capital neuts existed, one capital neut would likely instantly cause the death of subcaps (ships wouldn't be able to warp/rep and most wouldn't be able to use weapons). it would also become the way to gank cap ships. drop a carrier with a full rack of capital neuts on enemy caps, drain them (doesn't take much) so they can't jump, and you suddenly have a super-sized hac that is far more difficult to kill. capital neuts would be an ""i win button"" - which should not exist in an mmo."
3/24/2010,"the alpha release of eve-gate has the sharing of your character's list set to ""visible to everyone"" and there is currently no way to make select a private option. this means that if you have a character set to +5 or greater and they add you to their buddy list then all the characters in your address book will be available to them. as well there is no option to opt-out of using eve-gate or sharing your buddy list.it is true that the data on sisi is 2 weeks old, however it is also a copy of productional data and is therefore compromising the annonymity of characters buddy list.if any character who runs a spy network has someone (any character) set to greater than +5, all of their contacts are available to that person. this is extremely damaging and valuable information.this has been brought to the attention of the developers 18 hours ago but they don't seem to be concerned about it so i'd like to bring this to the attention of the csm. this issue needs to be fixed immediately and i don't know where else to take this as the devs don't seem to care."
3/24/2010,now is it not only possible to view another characters contacts you can also view any contact information. you want to know the above info about anybody just add them as a contact and follow the instructions above. will somebody bring this to the attention of someone who can do something about it? or could people start petitioning ccp (i would but i'm at work) until they start listening? eve-gate needs to be turned off immediately until this issues are resolved!
3/24/2010,there is an official issues thread here:
3/24/2010,"it seems eve-gate is down. possibly to sort this out? anyway, good catch."
3/24/2010,"looks like they fixed it. they really need to de-couple in game ""buddies"" with out of game buddies. most of my in game ""buddies"" are enemies i am tracking: very few of my friends are on the list."
3/24/2010,"i think you should post to ""features and ideas discussion"" to discuss this idea and see if you and the community can find a way to make it into a workable mechanic that is worthy of consideration for my support."

3/24/2010,question: how would you keep the cloaked ship locked to continue running the mod?
3/24/2010,lol uk propose remote cloak
3/24/2010,too much crap is cloaking in the game as it is. not supported.
3/24/2010,"you gave no reasons for these changes. unless you have something beyond ""i want this ship to be easier to use for me"" then this topic does not deserve support.i would support ui changes but no mechanics changes. eve is harsh and should remain that way. don't forget bpos."
3/24/2010,"never said anything about no mode swithing, as far as i know (as i dont own one yet) you hit the indy core the ship does its nifty transform and roll out....... and then you have 10 minutes before the core stops and the ship referts to normal , ( if im wrong please tell me ) , i simple think it would be better if you could have it change for the 7 minute you need it or for the 3 hours your corp needs it.the main idea with the new skill books was to give those that bought them something to have as they would no longer be needed. i guess that you could simple use the current mining skills instead. but i do like the idea of the 4 grinders and how ore is loaded like ammo and after its done its cycle a compresed ore is placed in your cargo hold.and lastly im pretty sure i gave a good explenation why i didnt think the rorqual should need fuel"
3/24/2010,"i support this, rorq killmails would look pretty"
3/24/2010,would be a nice bonus for those who do use rorquals for stuff other than chilling behind pos shields.omg we don't use a rorqual outside shields and therefore no bonuses should be added to boost that role is kind of close minded imo.
3/24/2010,"hi, meet me.i fit tech 2 rigs on various ships.not all are as insanely expensive as you may think.some tech 2 resists rigs are actually decently priced for eg."
3/24/2010,they already have one of those for your cargo hold it's called a cargo container
3/24/2010,"fair enough but:firstly a cargocontainer too reveals a certain amount of information (max volume of the cargo inside the container) which allows an experienced pilot to draw conclusions from.and secondly, not all items in eve fit into a cargocontainer.i know this is certainly a minor sidenote but personally i think ther should be a coutermeasure for everything in eve (like thos pesky afk cloakers).don't get me wrong, i wouldn't want this module to make ships entirely unscanable. that would encourage the hauler autopilot toursim too much. it should just lower the chance of a successful scan"
3/24/2010,how's about instead of suggesting modules to reduce the risk to your afk gameplay experience you equip yourself to deal with the threat accordingly using the more than adequate tools provided?
3/24/2010,"this module is a logical development concerning the eve universe and the backstory.it's not meant to be an addition to ""afk gameplay experience"". it's a mean of passive protection for any pilot, afk or not.if i may add, your signature doesn't help your cause larkonis""please resize your signature to the maximum file size of 24000 bytes. zymurgistno. larkonis""regards, lax"
3/24/2010,"your module idea has no drawbacks for the protection it provides. it needs some kind of risk vs reward. i suggest that it should be a lowslot module (thus reducing the amount of cargo expanders you can fit) as well as reducing the base cargo capacity of the ship (for the extra strong bulkheads required to shield the contents from scanning). in this way rather than it just being standard module on all haulers, people would have to decide between safety or capacity.of course this could also backfire as anyone scanning the ship would see this module fitted and thus assume it was carrying something juicy if you want to proceed with the idea you'll need to raise it as a proposal in the assembly hall so people can vote on it (or not)."
3/24/2010,"making it a lowslot item would certainly be a good idea to balance the module. it might add some depth to the hauler bsuiness although i fear that most people will regard it as unnecessary and complicated. from a rp standpoint a scanblocker should definitely exist in the eve universe. ccp might aswell reintroduce the smuggling skill alongside with the mod. pilots could use the module to smuggle contraband under the eyes of concord. i'm not up-to-date with smuggling and therefore do not know how valuable blockaderunners are for that job. last thing i heard was that concord scans your ship within the fraction of a second. in that case the cloak would ultimately be useles. dont know if that is true toughregards, laxps: and thank you teadaze for your constructive criticism"
3/24/2010,"explain your reasoning?but mainly afkwow, if that's the best you can do to insult me i'm guessing you're new around here.i'd be more open to this if it 'scrambled' scan results in a manner so that they appeared like the results on a ship scanner (ie incomplete with some duplicates) as opposed to a blanket blocker seeing as if everyone fit one which blocked scan results completely i wouldn't know who to gank!"
3/25/2010,"something tells me that even with this much support, the next meeting minutes will completely ignore this issue outright."
3/25/2010,yes.
3/25/2010,how did i miss this?yes.
3/25/2010,"not even just deimos, brutix, rannis, etc... blaster boats in general are not worth flying to an extent if you have minmatar(0 cap use) or amarr(sick dps/range). hell, i'd almost rather fly a caldari missle boat and start training at ground zerojust look at a autocannon myrm as a prime example, there's no way in hell someone would give that up for a blaster myrm. the real problem is lasers, autocannons, and even the assault missles(to an extent) are also short range.. but all of these have a realistic damage potential when being used around 15km away... blasters and blaster boats fall far short"
3/25/2010,funny how i attempted to raise the tracking part of this issue a year ago and the csm voting it down back then! strongly supported!
3/25/2010,i use to fly solely gal but now i mainly fly ammar because the range bonus for the ammar compleatly out weigh the damage of blasters in relation to how slow the gal ships are
3/25/2010,"i will not berate you for the slaughtering of the english language you have perpetrated, since i don't give a damn, it's not my native language anyway.every single bit of your quote demonstrates how little time have you devoted to read the thread. every phrase you have put in writing shows that you don't understand the issue here.since i don't want to repeat myself, go back to page 1, start reading, take notes of the arguments used, compose a legible and logical argument of which parts you disagree with and we can discuss it. before you do that,however, do read up on benchmarking and performance comparisons, it will let you realise what are the faults in your line of thought.just to let you know, i do think that the ammo-weapon system interaction and the coefficients that define the turret's performance are indeed the crux of the matter.furthermore, i hold that the solution must be simple and elegant with as few changes as possible."
3/25/2010,"well, only issue i have with this 15% damage fix is it does close to nothing for the rokh. people will still tell me to get gallente bs 4 to take advantage of my t2 rails.rokh will do less damage than a mega at pretty much every practical range. the bit more buffer it gets isn't worth it."
3/25/2010,"unfortunately the rokh's problems vs the megathron stem in large part from t2 ammo which is another, larger and more complicated issue as well as the whole armor vs shields debate. the fixes proposed here may not make the rokh excel particularily but it will put it in the ballpark at least."
3/25/2010,"well, the way i understand it this 15% damage boost will give gallente ships comparable punch to amarr ships. but this will still leave the rokh out in the cold.even the proposed adjustment to spike range won't create any kind of niche big enough to squeeze a certain caldari tier 3 bs in."
3/25/2010,"the reason that the proposal also includes a reduction in the optimal bonus for spike is to prevent mega being op.moving spike's optimal bonus from 80% to 70% will allow (rokh optimal)=(mega otpimal +1/2 falloff), so even if (rokh dps)=85%(mega dps), they will have equivalent performance.the 15% damage increase is enough to put both ships in the same ballpark with pest and apoc."
3/25/2010,"i'm not convinced it's nessesary to mess around with spike, sure the mega will be doing damage equal to a tach apoc but it will be doing so at considerably less range. 403dps @ 183km the rokh by comparison would do 369dps @ 249km a fair trade-off in my mind. fixing the rokh would require making tungsten ammo @ 197km do equal or greater damage then spike, currently spike does 33% more damage leaving the rokh and all other long ranged weapon systems with little reason to every switch up from their t2 ammo and thus leaving the rokh unable to trade range for damage until you're dealing with thorium, the first ammo type to do more then spike and that sits at 123km, hardly even sniping any more."

3/25/2010,oh i can already see this getting toasted.
3/25/2010,"lol. failbong can't speak for himself, right? maybe because he doesn't even know how to fit an eagle (he flies amarr anyway) and doesn't understand benchmarking? or is he banned and can only post in shc? i wouldn't be surprised, last time he tried to counter my arguments he ended up ****posting.or is it because he fails even at fitting apocs.conveniently forgetting to divide by resources required to build either ship (in isk) invalidates everything else you said. go back to shc and cry some more, maybe post a few nice pics too. you just claimed that apoc is worst than rokh and that all the people that field apoc in their fleets are stupid. law of large numbers says otherwise, while statistics show that the favorite ships for fleet use is apoc> mega> pest>>>>>>>>>>>rokh (you are lucky if you see 4 or more rokhs in a fleet, anyone that has trained hybrids flies megas for the armor tanking)thank you for doing such a good work to discredit yourself. i could not really match up to the clarity of your own arguments. how can i not disregard anything you say if i take that fit into consideration?p.s. bolded the parts where you fail.p.p.s.efficiency= performance/resources allocated. dps*ehp=performance, get it?edit: my dyslexia strikes again."
3/25/2010,i would also think that ehp is only equal to dps in one on one engagements in total value since primary tactics mean ehp is only needed as a buffer to keep you from being popped before remote repping kicks in. so total dps output of the fleet is vastly more important than total ehp of the fleet. not to mention the obvious preference in fleets for armor tanking that negate those fittings almost entirely.
3/25/2010,"strongly disagree, whats next, they can repair ships in hanger array...the mechanics in place work just fine and should stay as intended. as you have pointed out there are options to repair the drones without docking in a station. what more to carrier pilots need, auto-eject when below certain % shields/armor ???"

3/25/2010,"bigger fonts are not always better fonts, but an option to change size would certainly make the game more enjoyable (or playable at all) for many people. you have my vote."
3/25/2010,"entirely agreed, at 1920x1080 (very common these days), i already have to start squinting my eyes or place the screen closer, costing me lots of desk space. chat can be sufficiently enlarged, but the ui fonts remain extremely small."

3/25/2010,"i do own almost every console out right now including the old atari lol. yeah i'm a diehard gamer what can i say. i also build myself a new computer about every one to three years to keep up with the pc gaming world. dust514 on a console is going to be a little difficult to swallow. i play counter-strike well all of the half-life games really. but, mainly counter-strike:source. i used to play counter-strike competitively and i still keep ties with teams that do by running a gaming community that sponsors teams in cevo and other leagues. some of the pc gamers play with console controllers rather then keyboard and mouse simply because they play both online console fpss and pc fpss its easier to switch back and forth. some lan tournaments my teams have gone to offer both controllers and keyboards/mouse setups on they're tournament pcs. i've only been to two tournaments that used consoles one was a halo tournament and the other was a old school golden eye tournament back in the day. console just isn't used that much for fps game play. i know there are a lot of console fpss out there but compared to pc, its nothing. now with the release of mag the number of fpss for consoles may change but if you think about it. dust514 is going to be directly competing with mag. which from what i've been reading about both games dust514 vs mag......is a very very bad idea and dust514 even with the support of a great mmo will likely fail. so personally i think what really happened is ccp didn't do they're research on fps players and just decided to make an fps game for an mmo that would attach itself. kewl idea but ya really need to put your feelers out to actual fps players not just your current eve mmo players. just a guess but they are prolly hoping for eve to carry them, not to mention the fact that i'm sure a number of eve players like to play fpss as this thread clearly shows. so more then likely a number of eve subscribers will either a.) keep they're accounts on eve and create an account on dust514or b.) drop they're account on eve and switch over to dust514either way ccp could have easily fixed this by releasing it on both pc and console though more expensive they would have a larger play base to work with and a bigger market. then again they would be competing with every single fps out rather then just a couple. however if they really wanted to impress the world pull a reverse on the pc gamers. set it up so you can run keyboard and mouse controls on the console. though i don't know if that would work for xbox i know it would prolly work great on ps3 lol. oh well hope ccp doesn't screw this up and sinks all kinds of cash into dust514 in so doing loosing players on both eve and the new dust514 having to sell the games to a big game company like ea that will ruin everything lol. but who knows dust514 might kick everythings but and become the next counter-strike with over 1.5mil players online playing on various servers all over the world at the same time."
3/25/2010,"there are many long time players in eve who don't enjoy the risks of lowsec, but are looking for more variety and challenges with our eve experience. it is getting stale in hisec. name me a mission, i'll tell you what ships to expect, what damage type to deal and defend against etc. not fun at this point with no mission variability. adding lvl 5 agents in hisec would add a significant challenge for such players. ...and before you all start flaming, because of the lower risk, lower the rewards from running in hisec vs lowsec. make the most rare loot drops in lowsec, and lower the isk pay outs in hisec. kar"
3/25/2010,"the only reason this game is stale for you is because you lack the balls to actually go out and have risky fun.level 5s in highsec won't change ****. also, highsec doesn't need people making even more riskfree isk/h."

3/25/2010,nice troll bro.all the cool kids are already running level 5's in hisec anyway
3/25/2010,"this is about the third thread you've trolled today, but here it goes...the op said, ""...and before you all start flaming, because of the lower risk, lower the rewards from running in hisec vs lowsec.make the most rare loot drops in lowsec, and lower the isk pay outs in hisec.""essentially, he wants to nerf highsec mission payouts (at least level 5) so that it's more profitable to do them in lowsec. it's quite different than him being some carebear who wants even more risk-free isk faucets.i don't support this because i don't think any well-paying missions should be in highsec (the relatively safe isk faucets should be moved toward more interesting things like exploration, but that's for a different thread), but if ccp is going to keep high-paying highsec missions they might as well make them fun."
3/25/2010,"1. 8-10+ is a blob fyi.2. it's actually pretty understable because all u've written r variations of ""i can't handle the clone in which i've trained worthless skills for, knowing full well it's gonna cost too much. and even though i have all these alts to fall back on, i want the risk out of my rewards"".3. but the part where u somehow find fun to roam for 10 hours to find a blob to play cat and mouse with... if u wanted to do just that, just go into alliance territory and save yourself 10 hours--that way, u have 10 more hours of cat and mouse playtime! i'm just putting it out there but then again, i have a need to make sense so maybe it's just me.4. even so, it still wouldn't be enough because it requires a fleet, unless u've got that much time and/or desire for #3."
3/25/2010,"this is plain stupid...more sp mean more variety,more ships to fly,guns to fit etc.this way u can adapt at ur enemy tactics.that doesn't make u invulnerable and to be forced to pay for it,whatever reason ccp has in mind, is wrong. clones aren't expensive modules and/or ships,they are basic game mechanics.i'm not saying u must be a complete noob at 100 mils sp but there are situations u can't control and u get podded,again,and again."
3/25/2010,"it doesn't make someone invulnerable but it makes him a lot more useful and effective when 1. his dps, ewar, and tanking is maxed out, 2. he can overheat for the longest time possible 3. can whip out the hac of his choice or even a capital ship to adapt, compared to the newbie who is stuck with whatever limited options he has. and this added effectiveness follows u no matter what ship u're in, whether it's a frigate or a titan. in many ways, it is almost exactly like an expensive mod/ship because if u're still refusing to use an alt, then u're only confirming how the added effectiveness does make enough of a difference to warrant this cost."
3/25/2010,"this is last time then, just to clarify some things: 1. 8-10 even low sec pirates agree is a small/medium gang. and if you check the few times i've been involved with that many, the opposing side has had at least the double. (thats only shown in the cases were we loose ships though, keep that in mind)2. i believe you should re-read. 3. those 10 hours are used to play exactly cat and mouse with alliances 4. does not require a fleet, fully possible even solo! (and without boring cloaky stuff). and yes i do, it's the pvp i find fun. and to you're post below (the one above this one): at 100m sp's i can still not fly capitals, nor have i even maxed out every sub capital ship yet, i'll still be on sub caps for a good while more... also you seem to think that old chars magically gets wallets capable of throwing around billions like it's nothing, that is wrong. past 20m sp's, you isk/hour or isk/month abilities do not increase by anything more than a few (less than 5-8) unnoticeable %. neither does you're ability to live, as by 20m sp's you pretty much have everything within isk and survivability covered. what you do gain is versatility, (and eventually should one bother, capitals), the clone costs do not reflect this, that's with this is all about. not cutting costs, not lowering pvp risk. making costs not grow exponentially but instead linear or a curve that slows its increaase the higher it goes. are you able to understand that? if not, what are you doing in a topic you quite obviously are incapable of understanding?"

3/25/2010,"here's the thing... i know some people want to have add-ins for eve online the way you can have them for other games like wow for example. i know ccp said no to this because they have concerns about security. but i've been thinking about an alternative that should satisfy those concerns and at the same time bring more flexibility to the game client. and what i'd like to have is a way of integrating web applications with the game.with the new and quite powerful igb the number of web applications created for eve will be going up. there's all sorts of things people will be creating in order to get functionality that the client doesn't have or will never have. tools for coordinating big scale logistics, mining operations, trading and so on. but all of those goodies have to run inside the igb which means you have an address bar that you don't really care about and tabs and all sorts of things that aren't really useful. at the same time you don't get the useful stuff like having those applications behave like any other window meaning they're not part of the layout. if i create a tool to help me plot a course through null sec using a jb network i might want to have that open all the time on my screen since the moment i log in. i don't want to sift through my bookmarks or my open tabs for it. or maybe a tool for w-space exploration to help people coordinate their scans when they try to find an exit... or map out that exit with intelligence information. those and more would greatly benefit from better integration both in terms of look and usability.so my proposal for ccp is this: give us the ability to register web pages as applications with the client. once that is done i would be able to open those applications and they should behave like any other window. you would have the name at the top and the regular controls for minimize and close window and everything inside would be just the html rendered. one step further would be to have some css classes to match the client look so that i could make a button in my application look just like any other button in the client. also the scroll bars could be rendered like the scroll bars in game rather than like the html ones.please let me know what you think and help me get this on the table with ccp."
3/25/2010,well this is something i can wholeheartedly support - being able to integrate web apps into the ui/window structure would be very cool. +1
3/25/2010,"i like this, gets my vote!"

3/25/2010,supported!
3/25/2010,"it could work something like this:have a ""create custom window""-button somewhere in the client.clicking that just creates empty ""window canvas"" object (with normal eve ui window controls).have a ""import web content""-function in the custom window that basically just brings in a instance of the igb ""tab"" tied to certain url (sans windowframe, toolbars etc).this way it would be up to everyone to decide what apps they want to import into the ui without it having to go through ccp approval processes etc. essentially it would just be a browser window embedded into normal client window framesso security-wise for ccp it wouldn't be any different from the igb (because everything would execute in the igb). for us players it would bring less cluttered and more unified ui experience."
3/25/2010,"@darius mclever ... what charney said. but actually i was thinking of something even simpler. something more like a button in the igb to say ""add this to my applications"". of course the site would have to be trusted already. once you hit that the applicat"

3/25/2010,"no.releasing multiple mmos on a single platform is a dumb trap that many mmo makers have fallen into. it causes cannibalization of the market. that is to say, eve would lose at least some membership to people jumping to dust. instead, they release it on consoles, a totally seperate market, gain some people who like console shooters but have no interest in the more in depth nature of eve, as well as hordes of players who can just mine on eve while killing in dust.in short, its a smart business decision."
3/25/2010,i was thinking so many other social groups and work places recognize brest cancer awareness day why doesn't eve? well this would require programming and one day patch updates only to be removed the following day. so why not a minor long term solution that would only need to be implemented once? - we already have one pink ship the phobos that is pretty ****ty compared to the onyx and broadsword and kind of resembles a ****. well why couldn't it resemble a boob? - could edit jita 4-4 slightly so it resembles a boob or put a pink brest cancer awareness ribbon by the undock point. - we donated gtc's to a natural disaster why couldn't we have a campaign where we donate to valuable research to save more lives?though if the above is false about the one day change and it is not a big issue to simply turn the ship templates pink. we could have a pink-online day to represent our commitment to finding a cure and to bring awareness to others.

3/25/2010,"thank you bagehi, you pretty much have hit the nail on the head. while i already grant all my full corporation members the junior accountant role to let them see what is going on, i dont see this using a external tool as a particularly good way of building up trust.rakshasa, i am curious as to your phraseology, i am assuming you are refering to the dev effort involved in creating the tool rather than the difficulty of creating an extra function, inner joins and lookups for database queries?furthermore if we use an internal to the game tool / method to do this there is less chance of someone developing a tool to do this and ""accidentally"" harvest logins and passwords to be reported back when the tool checks for updates. yes i know there are those on here who are exceptionally good at coding and are able to design this tool without too much effort, or analysing the code to see exactly what it does. i unfortunatly tend to be able to test code and get a rough idea what it does while being able to write ""hello world"" scripts on a good day.one of the reasons it may be that more corporations do not do this is the amount of effort involved in executing this, as well as implicit trust in the person who develops the code. i am going to have a bash at throwing something together, but the key point is that an internal ccp tool that actually helps corp managment or industry hasnt been delivered in a significant amount of time. furthermore it simplifies director / ceo workload which is already high enough as it is. yes the vast majority of the great unwashed who have no exposure to this wont give a d**n either way, but it certainly would make financial tracking and investment planning a lot easier.granted i understand the ""if it aint broke dont fix it"" argument, but just because we could use flint and steels and an open fire for all our cooking, i bet theres a few of you who like using a microwave occasionally.incidentally, by default i would anticipate the default wallet would remain master unless otherwise specified. as stated earlier i am aware that this would probably not be a trivial thing to address, however eventually, a sprint team may possibly look at wallets, roles, and industry hence proposing it. anyways off to vs to see if i can remember how to make a function."
3/25/2010,"thats a good outline. i can certainly understand the use of this, especially as corporations start to scale up in size. this could certainly go along with a more generalized overhaul of the corp management system, which imo is already needed. your current proposal is actually only specific because you're stating your specific use of this potential function. you could use it for example to allow investment on a specific thing (we'll use a bpo as an example), and then pay dividends only based on that investment's performance by using a certain wallet for the sales generated by that bpo. in general, just allow more control of what money goes where, and allow dividends to be paid to different groups from different wallets. supported."

3/25/2010,the main barrier to entry in 0.0 are players. so unless you change the playerbase you will get very little with your change. people don't want unknowns in 0.0 and people getting to 5 millions sp after 2 month playing will be unknowns. you need player skills to survive in 0.0 and the 5 million sp is more an indication of time spent playing than a needed level of sp. so unless you know some 0.0 player or can show some kind of curriculum people alredy living inn0.0 will see you as some kind of liability even if you have half a zillion sp. basically: it change little beside having faster training alts.
3/25/2010,training has nothing to do with it.it's a matter of where... why... how... what... don't matter how many sp's.the barrier into null sec is low sec... once you get past that.. then you got alliances that control various areas of space.excusing it for lack of training is just going to make the alt problem far worse.so basically you've wasted your time.
3/25/2010,"you've better stopped your hard work at this point.i do not wonder that you heard something like this, because it is widespread myth - what does not make it less than pure bs. pve-wise you can start from 1 mil sp in ""real"" skills (not learning) or even less. or, right from the day one, there is no ""game mechanics"" to disallow this. no skill-locked dungeons, you know.if you talk about 0.0 corp's requirements, then: - they may vary a lot; - it is not sp corp's are concerned about. it is real player experience. sp here is used as a convenient measurement tool for game time spent and real player skills (assumingly )acquired. established corps do not want many clueless newbs, no matter how much sp they formally have.your ""null-sec entry barrier"" is social and psychological thing, not something directly implemented in game mechanics, as you are prone to believe."

3/25/2010,"this is why titan (and supercapitals in general, really) proliferation is a bad thing.it forces people to blob up to kill them. for people who can't/won't blob up, it makes it untenable for them to deploy capitals against a corp or alliance with a supercapital pilot online, which makes committing to major subcapital battles in the presence of a threat to capital escalation untenable, purely on the basis of that single supercapital pilot. which, since no one likes constantly losing and/or being denied fights, encourages people to attempt to blob up. furthermore, they create an insurmountable barrier between the old rich and the new and/or poor (unless the latter join a massive blob).that you somehow seem to think this is okay is why you don't ""get"" the problem and the thread.oh, supported."
3/25/2010,"usually when you use broadcast you gotta have it up and look at it, sometimes shinny and other times blinky but not everyone (like me) likes it because ""its another"" window opened.so how about when you broadcast an order like ""broadcast: align to"" it uses your fleet chat so the whole fleet can see it ? that would be great for small fleets...probably for big ones too.i don't usually use the broadcast window to look at the orders being displayed. for an fc that would be a great tool in its asset."
3/25/2010,"sorry for my english and my crazy ideas. for my english i can't do anything atm. but why is it a crazy idea? meaby i dont explain correctly again. i dont say make cheaper t3 ships. i'm saying that a more balanced prices in salvaged items should be more correct. meaby you dont understand very well, but with balanced prices the final price of one t3 ship can be the same.with my example i tryed to explain that 2/3 of the price it's caused by only one item. it's simple, isn't? i hope you dont lost again."
3/25/2010,"yes, i would support of making price distribution more regular. after all, melted ribbons are supposed to be ""common"" salvage. but it costs thousand times more than ""rare"". talk of lack of simple math somewhere in drop tables.just i have growing suspicion that it is hard if not impossible to make the hypothetical new equilibrium anyhow stable. just a gut feeling. i would like to be wrong here."
3/25/2010,"while nanoribbons are indeed the 'bottleneck' in t3 production (and quite a large one at that) their distribution is random and you find just as many (proportionally) in a c1 as a c6. t3 ships are at a reasonable price right now, mess with the drop rates/tables and you really risk upsetting the balance and potentially sending the price of t3 hulls all over the place."
3/25/2010,"i was talking with my corp mates cause we just moved to 0.0 and alot of the industrial core has been complaining that cloakers, specificly stealth bombers, have been coming in and afking in the system which puts a big stop to industrial activitys cause no one seems to want to ""waste"" time gaurding them and they could get jumped at any moment... well theres no real way to catch them eather so heres my ideahave a sovernty structure like the cyno jammer that allows you to ""ping"" or ""flash"" a system that will instantly and temporarly (for like 5-10 seconds) decloak every ship. this allows players to scan down these pesky afk cloakies and kill them and scare off active cloakies to make systems safer....i know your all going to say ""oh this isnt fair!""wrong.... heres whythe device will be placed outside the pos field and is open to attackthe device can be used every 30 minutes to an hourthe device can only be placed if you own soverntyyou have a specific level/type of upgrade to your hubsany one out in a safe spot (not in a common spot like outside a station, belt or gate) would have to be scanned down giving the player time to come back and recloak.or my other idea is very simulara system that sets a timer for cloaking devices.... when this system is placed and online all cloaking devices in the system depending on which device (t1, t2 and so on) will be active for 1 or 2 hours before shutting down for 5 minutes. of course you would have to have a log or something so they cant just jump out and jump back in and be poof instant reset kinda thing.so yea... tell me whatcha think and be nice :poh and while your here cheak out my other posts!paintshop"
3/25/2010,"i think it's better than the other idea, meaby with a bit retouch but good idea."
3/25/2010,"so you want to live in 0.0 and be all cool and stuff.but you don't want to defend or guard anythingand you don't want to be ""jumped"" or be involved in any non-consensual pvpyou think you need a device to counter something that cannot target, shoot, kill or do anything to you.i think you need to go back to high sec or possibly back to wowthis topic only reaffirms how broken the local mechanic is. why should you be able to know if their are cloakers in system? isn't the whole point of cloaking is that you are not detected? if anything, cloakers should be removed from local so they can actually be used to surprise opponents and while we are changing local let's scrap it all and put in a new mechanic. no support for this kind of proposal ever."
3/25/2010,"stop whining.... is that all you trolls do?i am trying to level the playing field between cloaking and non cloaking ships.... as far as nonconsentual pvp thats what the timers are for! duh!!!! have some one come in, if their really active or stupid they will ping that one person then a fleet of sb's can come in and reak havok for the next hour or so with out getting caught unless the pilot of the sb is stupid. oh and just so you know i would gaurd some one but im kind of broke at the moment for helping the move to 0.0 so once i get my pvp ship back ill happily gaurd but i cant gaurd an entire mining op and possibly even rorquals by myself. people dont want to do it cause they dont see it as important cause they would rather be running plex's and making money but ***** cause theres very little or nothing on the market cause the industrials are struggling to make stuff for you to use.now why dont you come back with a convincing argument as to why we cant do this other then ""im a noob"" or ""this is unfair to every one who pilots a cloaking ship"" about your only convincing argument is the part about them being stealth but like all stealth anything theres always something thats not covered, for example! if we had it in real life cloaking would only hide you visualy... a device that sees magnetic fields, electronic signatures or thermal signautes would see right though it.... and no matter how quiet the stealthiest sub in the world is you bounce a ping agenst it its gonna be found.oh and considering that ccp doesnt make it so that cloaks drain a huge ammount of cap or have a timer you guys allready have it pritty easy."

3/25/2010,no. have someone in your corp train for a rorqual. it's not that hard and it's a surprisingly capable and versatile ship.0.0 logistics are already far far too easy as it is and this could have wider effects than that.
3/25/2010,"no no no no no! you do not get any hint on what the password was, only that you cracked open the cargo. you get the same agro as a normal can theft. and as a response to this we get an encrypted secure container that takes 10x longer to hack. but it also contains 10x more stuff. (also adjust it's volume so it can't be used by haulers as a way to get free storage)imho a basic hack should be like the in game mission style where you have to sit close, and wait. sometimes you get it right away, other times you can be sitting there for an hour or more. (which sucks and would leave you very vulnerable to any sort of attack if someone was in system).asa for notification, an after the fact type would be alright, but it'd be nice to know instantly in game that a can's being hacked into. the risk should be purely that you find out and come after them though, second they begin to ""attack"" your can, they are painted by the owner, and possibly the corp as well."
3/25/2010,"first off: that was no insult. i don't need to insult anyone. it just seemed odd to me that a person who talks that way to a forum admin wants to ""contribute"" somethign to that thread. but i see you actually can contribute something useful. no offense.ok, my reasoning. i regard that from a roleplay point of view if you like. eve is a gigantic hightech universe, with more scammers and scumbags than inhabitants (sometimes). it's just logical to me that some of them (or at least one) invented a mod to ship contraband through highsec without concord noticing it.for the afk issue, well i can't force people to stay on the pc while playing eve but neither do i think that this mod would encourage afk travel. as teadaze said, there should be a downside. one could be to make it a lowslot module, so that haulers would have to sacrifice cargohold. another one could be to give the mod very steep fitting requirementsi think that smuggling should become a mini profession (again). if you looked at eve with my eyes you would see that there had to be such things like smuggling and maybe scanblock modules =) regards, lax"
3/25/2010,"maybe you shouldn't be a lazy ass gate camper. stop your *****ign abtou peopel being able to play the game afk, that makes it easier for you to lock on, lock down, and pillage. it makes your job easier when you try to poke your nose into the trunk of a ship and get told no! ""hmm, no addimtance huh? must be something worth me shooting them for then in there.""here's a thought, make it a highslot, make it active, and make it use a ton of cap. so, using it is the difference between say... making it across the system in 2+ jumps, or having the gatecampers see what's in the trunk. also, if you have it running, and someone tries to scan your cargo, they get told flat out you are running a scrambler. they're faster, they can beat you to the next gate unless they too are afk."
3/25/2010,how many days in advance issues should be put in this list? the most dutiful csm member is teadaze that has at least reserved a space. there is really nothing to discuss at this time?
3/25/2010,"ofc there is. we are talking about issues unofficially between meeting all the time, then post the agenda day or two before the meeting. its a process we adopted in csm 4.0 and it works, gave pretty good solutions for most issues so far.also we are discussing list of fixes and features for development assessment as part of the new process for csm that we agreed with ccp last summit (explained in last devblog).csm 4.0 is still in the office and working hard"
3/25/2010,"so we will know what will be discussed too late to try to convince a csm member to add a topic to the list. sorry, but the new procedures you are implementing seem to put more and more distance between the csm and most eve players."
3/25/2010,"as i understand it, if you want a topic raised on a meeting, you promote this idea before the csm members decide what they will pick up. this list will allow the other csm members that didn't raise the topic to have a few days to read up before the actuall session. it doesn't put any distance between csm and ""regular"" eve players, instead showing us what's going on before the meeting."
3/25/2010,"fixed it for you. if you are very concerned that topic be included, make that known ahead of time instead of waiting like a lazy troll to see what isnt on the list and then complain that whatever isnt on there should have been. if you're trolling, try harder. if you're not trolling, try harder."
3/25/2010,"great brain alekseyev, a b normal?the issue should be in the assembly hall at least 1 week before the csm meeting so there is no way to add something at the last moment. what this change do is to make impossible to try to contact a csm member to get him to support a argument if you see that is passed over again after several csm meeting. not that it will make any difference as the arguments are chosen at the total discretion of the csm members, seeing how ""forcing"" a discussion require 5.000 voters in 1 week.i am very curious to see what ""crucial"" topics will be in the discussion this time."
3/25/2010,"problem: the chat filter on the eve-o site and forums is very strict, while the chat in the game remains unfiltered (but you can get pwned by gm for even sayin pen15).we need user settable chat filters in and out of game. and as a side benefit the gms no longer have to waste their precious time smackin ppl for pen15ing in local. meaning the gms have time to do more useful things."
3/25/2010,"been awhile since i looked at aff, i'm not sure they'd like ccp plagiarizing their stuffs."
3/25/2010,"mephiston,over the past four csm periods, this issue has been raised several times already. factional warfare, the industry expansion, epic mission arcs, and just generally old and abandoned content has been mentioned to ccp.with csm5 becomming a stakeholder in the csm process, you might see the csm being taken more seriously. i hope this will bring about a policy change, as you are absolutely right that too much unfinished content is being rushed out of the door, and then abandoned, with every new expansion."

3/26/2010,god yes! please better/bigger fonts. i play at 2560x1600 and the eye strain is awful.
3/26/2010,yes because the rokh is the only ship that uses railguns
3/26/2010,"what you say is true only if both sides have equal numbers of ships, deal steady streams of dps without alpha, lock times and other such things and remain until every last ship is gone. as is it's not uncommon for ships to be killed in a single volley as fleet sizes increase making ehp less and less important and dps moreso. also this ignores all the times where you're shooting at a target that's either unable to shoot or unable to shoot effectively at the range you've chosen where dps is all that matters. put simply in any sniper ship doing damage at range is the core purpose of the ship and thus must be weighted more heavily then secondary capabilities such as survivability. furthermore the entire issue with a shield tank in fleets was mentioned by the above poster, i don't need to add anything other then he's right.finally if we're to believe your concept of fleet efficiency then not only should there be more rokhs but there should also be more abbadon snipers about since they're much much more efficient with their 446dps and 87k ehp tanks. while we all know that there are reasons that preclude such a solution from being popular or effective this dosen't show up in your 'preformance' chart and fairly effectively illustrates why the chart presents a thoroughly flawed persepective on the idea of sniper preformence."
3/26/2010,"the larger the gang, the more dps > ehpthe larger the fleet, the more alpha > dps.also, as has been said repeatedly: if the rokh is worse/comparable to the apoc but costs more, then the rokh is worthless.the way i fit the apoc was simply to prove that it was better as an ultra-sniper than the rokh, even though that is the rokh's supposed niche. you have to compare ships in the same element or it isn't a true comparison. you could put pulse lasers on the apoc and say ""see, the rokh is better at ranged combat!"" you have to compare them in the same element if you want to claim railguns do not need to be fixed.the hyperion and mega are also supposed to have a strong close-range niche (which they don't really have compared to pulse lasers), because they certainly don't have a long-range niche (because those ships are mediocre to bad for ranged combat). this is the point of the fits, to show that large rails do not have a niche in the game. medium rails also do not have a niche. the only ship they possibly work on is the eagle, and that's only due to the bonuses on bonuses on bonuses to range for that ship. small rails are just a joke (like small arties) - they can't track the stuff they are supposed to hit (i.e. not battleships or battlecruisers)."
3/26/2010,everyone keeps talking about the flavor of rails needing to change and not the dps so if my memory serves me correctly rails used to have a chance to bypass the first layer of defense and strike the second layer. that would make things interesting no doubt.
3/26/2010,"field command ships upgradetldr: **field** command ships severely lack any staying power, and or dps, and or fitting, in the current eve environment. since their introduction much has changed making field commands very obsolete for pretty much everything the field commands were designed for. for people who still don't get it: this thread is not for fleet command ships, only for field command ships (the ones that do not give bonuses). (that said, i believe some small tweaks to them could be welcome, particularly eos and if you want me to make a thread about those too, i'd be happy too, same for tier 1 bc's). having had the skill command ships at lvl 5 for well over 2 years now, and when people ask about command ships everyone always tells them to just fly a bc or t3 instead (or a bs if mobility does not matter), i thought it was time these got it's long deserved boost and make them more viable. i have been careful to not over boost them. field commands have become more and more obsolete as the years have gone by, thus i am proposing this upgrade to them. general boost to all 4 of them (absolution, nighthawk, astarte, sleipnir): -make them all use base hp's from the tier 2 bc class instead of tier 1, this will help them have a little more staying power on the field, but still not enable massive buffers. -a small agility boost. they handle almost like a plated battleship. -30-40% sensor strength boost. this will place them not as high as recons and certainly less than an eccm'd battleship, and is something they really need as they are far too easily disabled. ship boosts (all of them +1 slot). (all fitting increments are base values, thus skills will boost them further). absolution: +1 med slot, + 15 cpu. it is still unable to make much use of the last high slot bar a small neut/nos, but it can now fit an eccm making a harbinger not outclass it in every regard bar pure ehp (harb still does more dps). this will enable it to work better solo, or in gang situations (in a fleet you'd use the damnation after all). for being so reliant on capacitor it has a very small cargo bay, a small boost there could be helpful. i was going to ask for a +25 m3 drone bay and bandwidth, but that might be too much. alternative boost: +1 low slot, + 26 cpu. if possible additional powergrid to make last high slot able to fit something be preferred too, like gang link needs: +120 pg. conclusion: this will make the abso much more viable as either expensive solo or actually more useful than a harbinger in gangs due to sensor strength and a bit more staying power (harb still does more dps though). nighthawk: with the tiny hp boost proposed above this ship will still have ehp comparable with a drake pvp fit. as with the absolution this ship needs another slot, and this ship really needs a mid slot in regards to pvp, +1 med slot. a second thing it lacks which has been said countless times over the years is power grid, and it lacks a lot of it, assuming 5th low as a reactor control +80 pg, assuming power diagnostic, +150 pg, that is up to ccp, personally i'd recommend the +150 pg. (with the hp boost and +1 med slot, some people may be worried about super passive tanks, i'd like to point out that a rattlesnake would still be better and that such a fit can't do anything but lol dps or lvl 5 mission/ded 10 plex tanking. should ccp not like it, simply increase it's shield recharge base value somewhat to make it have the same passive tank as before it's boost). conclusion: you will have enough fitting for an active tank or a buffer tank (buffer tank does not fit cap booster as i believe giving it fitting for that would be too much). it will now no longer be a worse and more expensive drake but actually be viable, mostly due to sensor strength and another med slot like the abso. it will still be an expensive drake, just like the abso will still be an expensive harbinger, but it is no longer outclassed it every way."
3/26/2010,"astarte: this ship is a bit difficult, for being a pure gank ship it has too little dps over the other's and to little fitting for a proper neutron fit. to make it more ganky to keep it in it's role: +1 high slot, + 1 gun hard point, + 295 pg. this will enable it to fit 8x netron blasters ii and dual rep (assuming 2x dmg mods dual rep config with neutrons this will be the stats: 480 tank, 5x medium ecm drones will make that more effective, 856 gun dps). a small cargo bay increase for cap boosters just like the abso would be helpful too. edit: alternative boost: +1 low slot, + 165 pg. it would give it more survivability, but it would be less ganky, a sleipnir would do the same dps before drones, some people prefer this over the other proposal though, but in the end this is up to ccp. conclusion: a shield buffered brutix no longer is more or less better than this ship, it now has it's role as i believe the astarte was designed to have, a proper gank boat, but now it actually has a semblance of a tank and it has finally a dps advantage over the other ships in it's class. sleipnir: usually considered the best of the field commands (does not say much though), giving it another slot like the other's is a given and a tiny cpu increase for those who like xl booster configs. +1 med slot, + 45 cpu. this will enable it to keep it's niche as a heavy vaga/cyclone (depending on what you prefer, buffer or xl booster configs will now be a little better). conclusion: the sleip will be like it has always been but now a little better in it's niche role(s). the xl booster fit will still crumble under any form of neuting or fight's lasting more than a minute and the buffer fit is still slower than hac's or shield bc's. overall conclusion: the field commands will now be more than just expensive battlecruiser and have a place in solo and small/mid sized gangs like they should (fleet commands (like damnation) are for big gangs/fleets if you still haven't gotten it). they're severe lack of slots and fittings will no longer be such a huge issue as it has always been. they will not obsolete the battlecruiser class and in a straight 1 vs 1 a battleship rightly will still beat them just fine. they will certainly not be overpowered as some people keep fearing. (i believe the small hp boost and agility boost should also be applied to their base ships (prophecy, ferox, brutix, cyclone), but that their ''upgrading'' to be comparable to tier 2 bc's should be different than the changes to these field command ships). agree with the above idea? hate it? change/tweak it somewhat? post about it! and remember to check the ''i support'' field if you do! (and remember to keep proposals balanced!)."
3/26/2010,"i am not prepared to discuss what exactly must be done, but something must... and yeah, save eos from being useless.supported."
3/26/2010,"they are generally not used in pvp simply because the risk outweighs the benefit. the price is higher than a battleship, but a battleship brings more to a fight.i mean, if they are meant for mission running/ratting, give them a more carebear name and get rid of leadership requirements."
3/26/2010,"i support this idea, especially the sleipnir, always wanted an extra med on one of those :p (dont really know about the other field commands apart from mission nighthawk)"
3/26/2010,"i like this.well, i think the astarte is still problematic (because of rep bonus, and the fact midslots/lowslots are generally more valuable) but it's still a huge improvement.now, if only the sleipnir looked like a t2 hurricane"

3/26/2010,"you are correct. gas giants can appear anywhere in the starsystem, as long as they are able to condense fast enough before the star starts its reactions and blows away the gas and dust from the center.what i was poking at however was the mass of those gas giants, as it was a bit too small to be gas giant. to be gas giant the planet should have enough mass to keep some of the lighter gases. helium would be good start although i do not know where the line is drawn usually. then again, this issue has already sorted the best possible way (in my opinion) by ccp hiring the astrophysics guy from local university to take a good look at their planets and stars."

3/26/2010,read the above post - there has already been a fix so that if you declined a given mission (e.g. gone berserk) the next mission you are offered by that agent will not be gone berserk. if this doesn't happen then _bug report it_. it doesn't need to be raised by csm - its a bug.if the op is asking for something different then you need to rewrite your idea so it is more understandable.kithran
3/26/2010,"wait wat? i never said the idea needs to eliminate all missions you dont wanna do. i simply said, when i deny an attack of the drones mission, i shouldnt be offered the same mission when i convo the agent for another mission. where did i say i want it to eliminate all missions i prefer not to run? actually, i have run every mission in the game, but sometimes i'm not in the mood to run a certain mission."
3/26/2010,please provide a link to a changelog/devblog/patch notes that says this is the case? as of yesterday i'm still being offered the same mission immediately after declining.
3/26/2010,"i already provided a link to the patch notes that says this change should have been completed years ago with the release of revelations.as has been stated, if you are having this problem, the correct course of action is to file a bug report.ps. also, be sure to check that they are the same mission. there are plenty of missions that are very similar, but could qualify as being a different mission. break their will verses blood raiders is not the same mission as break their will verses guristas."
3/26/2010,i can definitely confirm that agents will quite often offer the same mission that has just been declined. declining a mission doesn't seem to have any particular effect on what mission is offered next.
3/26/2010,i endorse this product / service.having a refinery and a factory in the same system would be absolutely charming ( especially if their undocking ramps are pointed to each other )
3/26/2010,"[proposal] webbers, scramblers, jammers, neuts, and other modules should have approprate effects for ship size. no more frigates webbing battleships or cruisers warpscrambling battleships..."
3/26/2010,you just killed the bigger and better half of eve what are you smoking ?
3/26/2010,"wow. you really didn't think this one through did you. you realize why frigates web battleships right?that aside, why does ship size matter to these modules? what does hitting a ships engines with a graviton beam (or whatever the backstory is) have to with the relative sizes of the ships? until you explain why you feel this is an issue, you're going to get flamed. heavily."
3/26/2010,"so lets look at it from your point of view. if two fleets, one of 25 frigates and 25 destroyers goes up against one of 50 battleships, the fleet with smaller ships should be able to 1) web all 50 battleships, 2) concentrate all 50 ships firepower on 1 battleship, and 3) be able to defeat them in detail (i.e. one at a time.) (not talking about drones, they are easy enough to kill.....) the battle ships wouldnt be able to hit the frigates due to their speed and tracking, and the frigate/destroyers could pick away at the battleships and kill them one by one....where does that make sense to you?"
3/26/2010,"of course, and it is one of the corner stones of eve. bigger is not always the best.you probably are posting for the sake of posting, as apparently you have no clue about the game whatsoever."
3/26/2010,"no, i am trying to make the game relevent to real life. this is supposed to ships a thousand or more years in the future. there is no way that a frigate, destroyer, or cruiser should be able to defeat a battleship, period. its never happened in history, and it wouldnt happen a thousand years or more in the future. and yes, ship size would matter when it comes to module effect and battlefield dominance, due to power considerations and their ability to project they size and amount of distruption beam. it would not work as currently envisioned. otherwise, why would anyone build ships bigger than frigates?"
3/26/2010,"are you trying to troll assembly hall today or so?with your idea basically all tackling specialized ships would be almost obsolete.be it interceptor, heavy interdictors (oh i would be really interested how you try to solve that. capital warp disruption field generator?)all in all ... not supported."
3/26/2010,"actually you can kill frigates with battleships. it happens quite frequently. it's not easy, but then hey, nothing worth doing ever is.aside fromt hat, your argument is ridiculous. a 50 ship fleet of battleships with no frigate support? an fc that incompetent deserves to lose.after reading your posts from the ah today, it's becoming readily apparent to me that you:a) have no clue what you're talking about, and/orb) you're a troll."
3/26/2010,"""... period..."", hehe.not even speaking that ""relevant to life"" isn't always a best way to make a game.you have no clue about real warfare either.absolutely clueless or troll. most probably both at same time."
3/26/2010,i'm guessing you have never flown a dictor when 50 ****ed off battleships launch drones and declare you primary!trust me... the drones from 50 battleships will vaporize yer lil frig and destroyer gang no problem.

3/26/2010,the author must understand that the freedom of speech comes with freedom of listening.
3/26/2010,"small things can kill big things: one airplane destroying an entire (mock) fleet.your post had to do with webs, scrams, and jams. as i pointed out, throughout history, big ships are damaged by small ships so other big ships can come in and finish them off. destroying a ship's radar, damaging their engines, or jamming their rudder are not possible in eve (can't do targeted damage), so we can scram, jam, and web ships (which accomplish the same thing).if a battleship is killed by only a destroyer or frigate in-game, they are doing something horribly wrong.however, here is a historical case of a smaller ship defeating a larger ship: el gamo vs speedy. another instance in history is when the confiance (18 guns) defeated the hms kent (38-gun, 820 ton). point is, it sometimes has happened irl and in-game. usually light ships are used (in both) to harass a larger ship so heavier ships can come in for the kill."

3/26/2010,"while i don't necessarily think that learning skills are, in and of themselves, a waste of time, adding another learning skill is defiantely not the way to get faster training. we have enough learning skills.if you want faster training, i'd rather see them open up an advanced cybernetics skill that allows for better attribute implants (perhaps all the way up to +10)."
3/26/2010,"not supported. eve would be better without learning skills at all, not having more of them to train."

3/26/2010,i finished my learning skills 2 years ago. if you make me train a new one i will fly over to you and pod you back to the character generation screen!
3/26/2010,i have a better learning skill for you: how 'bout a skill which you train that would make it so you didn't have to train learning skills? that'd be awesome.
3/26/2010,"iow, you have yours, screw everyone else...."
3/26/2010,put the +6 and +7 implants into the game. they are already in the database.
3/26/2010,how on earth is adding more learning skills going to help you lower the amount of learning skills you have to train?
3/26/2010,"i would rather lose the million plus sp i have in learning skills, if it meant the removal of all learning skills, than have another learning skill added.skin off my nose? i don't want to have to waste time training another skill that has no other purpose in-game than to create another hurdle for new characters to work on. it provides no benefit to new players (who will have to spend more time training skills to train skills) and no benefit to existing players (who have spent time training skills without it)."
3/26/2010,make training time 10% faster for new players? are you dumb or something? they already receive a 100% skill training speed bonus until they hit 1.6mil sp.stop ****ing posting.

3/26/2010,i want this
3/26/2010,"makes a lot of sense, but mostly in your ""friendly"", i.e. corp channels."
3/26/2010,it would be really nice to be able to optionally set an afk status. this possibility need to be completely optional and without any auto-afk mode like in some other games.
3/26/2010,"make it. ""engage target/mine repeatedly""i don't see why miners shouldn't be able to hotkey control their drones."
3/26/2010,"i support this idea. the engage target shortcut should start a mining drone mining, when there is an asteroid as the current target."
3/26/2010,remove targeting range penality from warp stabilizers so pve players and mission runners can chose to enter combat with pvp'ers or not. in real life i can avoid fighting if i dont want to. same should be possible in eve.
3/26/2010,how about you just dont put stabs in?
3/26/2010,so basically undo the nerf they specifically put in a year or 2 ago?dont see this one going very far
3/26/2010,"a big no. this will lead to people sitting at 100+km from a gate, insta-popping ships like was so common before the nerf. 1-2 stabs in low slots to prevent anyone from being able to kill them. or carriers sitting on gates, ganking people, with a bunch of stabs so they can escape before enough people show up to tackle them. this was what low sec choke points looked like pre-stab-nerf. you couldn't travel between the different sections of high sec space and have a reasonable expectation of surviving.the warp stab nerf helps carebears more than it hurts them. don't ask for changes until you've fully thought through the ramifications. often, the nerfs are heavily for your benefit (like in this case)."
3/26/2010,you really didn't put much thought into this did you.
3/26/2010,"*facepalms* you will definitely break the record for most stupid suggestions in a row.benefit, less likely to be warp scrambled.price, targeting range penalty.seems balanced to me."
3/26/2010,anyone but pee v pee'ers want to comment on here?
3/26/2010,actually we are industrialists... sorry to burst your bubble.although we do pvp a little bit... not sure about darius... likely would be mean in a fight.
3/26/2010,"agreeing with darius here!and damn you op! i've had to wait another 5 minutes to describe how blisteringly stupid you are! since i just posted on the web thread!the uncatchable carriers, snipers, etc that plagued eve before the nerf to stabs is not something you want to return to!also your probably suffering from one of the following...desiring to rat/plex/mish in nullsec/losec in complete safety.you have been wardec'd and want to mish in empire.you have not yet considered the implications of the infinipoint on a heavy interdictor yet have you?also stop posting!"
3/26/2010,yes i would love to sit 130km off a gate with a sniper battleship raping people in the face while being able to get away from every interceptor that comes to pin me down for his fleet.supported!(oh and congratulations on the first thumbs-up you've gotten for any of your suggestions today!!!)
3/26/2010,"there is hope that ccp will release it on pc once the console noobcakes get modern warfare 3 or something similar and everyone run there ( which they inevitably will ).but for now, have patience and give them some time."

3/26/2010,"allow ship target to be marked by user as ""friendly, no fire"" to prevent friendly fire instances in combat. we are talking advanced computer system in several thousand years in the future, that type of marking would be standard on such advanced computers. will allow ships to be targetted for rr purposes and keep you from accidently attacking them. real life illustration of this is infrared strobs to mark friendly troops in combat today."
3/26/2010,it's called setting them to blue.duh?
3/26/2010,"before ccp added those nice standing icons to the locked targets i would have said ""ok maybe"", but now that issue is solved. if you cant differ between friends and foe now, well then you will shoot your friends. lets just hope you notice it before you blew them up."
3/26/2010,this. it has already been fixed.
3/26/2010,"also, please do not attempt to make eve ""idiot-proof"" which is really what you're trying to do here.in eve mistakes have consequences - just like real life. the correct response is to pay attention to what's going on around you."
3/26/2010,"you dont think the us military is currently working hard to prevent friendly fire incidents? and if mistakes have consequences, why doesnt theft and destruction of others property have consequences in eve? i.e. suicide ganking, where the person buys a cheap ship, buys insurance, blows up someone else's stuff, gets concorded, then gets paid back the money and more from insurance? your inconsistant here...."
3/26/2010,"this is not the ""us miliary"" (wts - spelling/reading/comprehension?)this is eve online... adapt or die.suicide ganking has nothing to do with standings either... what are you doing? pulling ideas out of your _____ today?stop comparing eve online to real life.... this game is not real life... if you think it is... time for you to leave and get a reality check.ccp puts standings on your overview hud to make it clear if someone is blue to you or not... if your even capable of understanding such a concept as i suspect your just a nooblet fresh out of whatever it is you came from.and even then... standings mean nothing when anyone and i do mean anyone can shoot you anyway."
3/26/2010,"you are supposed to be arguing that your idea has merit. we said ""a fix already exists"" and you haven't given a reason why the existing fix is not enough of a solution. imo, friendly fire in eve usually is attributed to drunk players.troll quote removed. zymurgist"
3/26/2010,"if you can mark a target as a fleet or squad commander and transmit that mark to other pilots so they can fire on it first, individual pilots ought to be able to mark targets and mark them as friendly target and not allow their guns to fire on them."
3/26/2010,"i, as an fc, can mark a target that tells people what they should be shooting at. i, as an alliance director, can mark standings that tells people whom they should and should not be shooting at. i, as an fc, cannot force a pilot's guns to fire upon a specific target. i, as an fc or alliance director, cannot force a pilot's guns to not fire upon a specific target.the functionality you are proposing is what's called ""dumbing-down the game"". if the logis in your fleet keep shooting friendlies, then it's time to say ""hey, stop being an idiot, or you're out,"" not ""hey, you can't stop being an idiot, so i'm gonna make it so you can't be an idiot."""
3/26/2010,"if you can point out targets for yourself, you can tell your ship not to shoot at those ships if you so chose, if this was accruate representation of space travel/commerce."
3/26/2010,"i can actually see a situation where the proposal would be useful, even given the current features:if you have multiple targets locked, some friendly (maybe you're spider tanking) and some hostile, then imagine that you're about to try to activate a harmful module on a hostile target. however, just before you press the button to activate the module, you lose the lock on that specific hostile target (maybe it just jumped, maybe it just warped, maybe it was just destroyed, maybe it just docked, maybe it just flew into a pos shield). your interface automatically selects a different target that you already have locked because, as long as you've got at least one thing locked, you must have a lock selection, and it brings up that different targetlock just a split second before you activate the module. the result, then, is that you've now activated a hostile module on a target that the computer switched on you.an alternative proposal would be to add a confirmation dialog. ""you're about to fire on a fleetmate/good standing/corpmate/alliancemate. are you sure? [ok] [cancel] [ ] do not ask me again"". like all confirmation dialogs, the user could turn it off permanently, and turn it back on later from the main menu. if this were to be implemented, then the confirmation dialog might be the fastest method of implementing it instead of a completely new tickbox somewhere."
3/26/2010,"notice: you cannot activate *module*, your targeting computer just lost a lock and is still confused, please wait one second.far superior solution than a confirmation dialog which anyone would have disabled anyway.personal attack is not allowed.applebabe"
3/26/2010,"make the amount of loot that drops related to the number and type of ships attacking. so if its a solo fight of equal ship class, all (or close to all) of the loot will drop. if you have a frigate getting ganked by a whole fleet not much (if anything) will be left.i suggest that this makes sense that less equipment would be damaged if there were fewer and less powerful attackers. in fact it always seemed odd that you could have just as much loot drop if you were killed by 60 others as you would if you were killed by 1. btw i don't think it will ""fix"" blobbing but it will be *something* to mitigate against it.i discussed the pros and cons in the features and ideas thread before posting. you can read that here."
3/26/2010,"definitely the way to go after you got all that ""positive"" feedback in f&id."
3/26/2010,"the blob does not care about your loot, it simply wants you dead."
3/26/2010,"supported. will definitely need some refining, but it's worth bringing up to the csm/ccp."
3/26/2010,"someone's been reading scrapheap i see...it's a nice idea and may well incentivise :small gangs: and :good fights: but it won't stop the blob (oh how i hate that term). when large fleets go out do you think they rank and file care about or expect to see any of the loots anyway?saying that, reducing loot drops to near zero for 'ganks' as you call them would be a bad thing imho, many alliances do fund replacement/reimbursement from the spoils of larger battles and under your system there would be little left from a 'legit' fleet engagement where both sides are equally matched.i'd be more inclined for agreeing with a near 100% drop in a 1vs1 with it scaling up to current rates and capping with say a 5vs1 situation."
3/26/2010,so let me get this straight... you think loot is going to dissuade people from blobbing?do you even have a inkling of an understanding fleet tactics? do you even know why they blob?sorry to say... you have no business coming up with ideas for something you quite clearly have no bloody idea what your talking about.loot is the last thing any fleet will consider... loot is just a consolation prize... the real prize is kicking your ass to kingdom come... with all due respect.
3/26/2010,i have been reading scrapheap challenge  its a great resource - but i did not see this issue brought up. i'm not very thorough.your idea of ramping up the loot drop for smaller fights but limiting the damage to the loot at a certain point (whether current levels or whatever) is certainly something to be considered. that would mean there would really only be a pvp boost. it would likely hurt industrialists though. how this balance should be struck would need to be considered. perhaps if we had statistics that would show how many and what types of ships are involved in kills we could better gauge the impact of these changes. but even if we don't have that information ccp could take small steps in this direction and sort of learn as they go.
3/26/2010,"trust me, the gank fleet was just as disappointed as you were that they found you. they definitely were looking for something more substantial to kill. possibly something that actually shot back at them. changing the loot drop isn't going to make a difference. they're just shooting you to get out the frustration of not finding something better to kill yet. i mean, people shoot pods, noob ships, and shuttles regardless of loot. in fact, gangs will shoot the wrecks, destroying the loot, so they can keep moving without leaving a trail."
3/26/2010,thanks for giving me due respect. :)to answer your questions:first question: im not saying it will fix blobbing. i think i said that in the op. it *will* provide a (perhaps small) disadvantage to larger fleet fights and a small advantage to fighting in smaller gangs. second question: yes i think i have an inkling of an understanding of fleet tactics. third question: i would need to know who they are in order to know their motivation for blobbing. so right now i will answer no i dont think i know why they blob.
3/26/2010,"right now the largest anchorable container is the giant secure container. or gsc for short. it can hold 3,900m3....that is a pathetically small amount of space for any real kind of use.the main reason i see gscs used is for mining ops. to be able to transfer ore from a miner to a hauler without using a container accessible by a can flipper.however, the space inside a gsc is so tiny that i literally mine more m3 per cycle then there is space in the gsc.what i am proposing is something that can be anchored with at the very least, 10,000m3. however, such a container would also have at least 10,000m3 volume to prevent storing them inside industrials to augment cargo capacity.arguements against: (and why they are silly)->this is really just a request to make mining easier.no it is not. mining into a gsc is an incredibly bothering task, it is much easier to mine simply into a jetcan. mining into a gsc is however, the only way to safegaurd ore. (other then leaving a belt). ->get an orca.orcas take months to train for and cost hundreds of millions of isk. it is simply not feasible to just 'get an orca' even if the corp you are in offers orca services they will not always be able to play to your schedule. ->have your hauler nearby.doesn't work if there is somebody hovering over your can waiting to steal."
3/26/2010,just to save people to post the same arguments against it again: features & ideas discussion thread
3/26/2010,"you have 3 choices:a) mine into a jetcan and deal with the possibility that your ore can be stolenb) mine into a gsc and be absolutely 100% secure from ore thieves, but with less capacityc) mine into several gscs and be absolutely 100% secure from ore thieves, but have to take the time to set them upi don't see the problem here. eve is a game of teamwork, strategy, and skill. i don't want to see people making a fortune on their own without the help of somebody. this is what corps are for. corps have mining ops. corps have orcas and rorquals. if you can't be online when your orcas are online, then you need to find a different corp.not supported."
3/26/2010,"this is exactly what i am facing! i really cannot see a problem with creating a bigger secure container, makes life easier. have never in my life seen a single valid reason why you cannot make a big box with a lock.because then they introduce a 1k m^3 secure container everybody will suddenly be making fortunes? your argument is silly. rorquals and orcas are ships. this guy is asking for a big box to put stuff into. i cannot see any reason why we cannot give him one."
3/26/2010,"then maybe you should read my post again. he has a big box he can put stuff into. it's called a cargo container. that box is insecure and lasts for one hour. if he wants a long-term secure storage container, than he's going to have to put up with the low capacity. it's a matter of balance."
3/26/2010,"jetcan is constructed in your ship, it can exceed your cargo capacity, you do not have to anchor it and place it,the giant secure container you do.and it's volume cannot exceed your ship's cargohold capacity. i still cannot see any way this would unbalance the game."
3/26/2010,"the balance lies in the ease of use vs the security from thieves. if security is more valuable than ease, use a secure container. if ease is more valuable than security, use a jet can. those are your choices. that is the balance."
3/26/2010,fixed it for you. nobody steals ore - or nobody does it in order to get the value of the ore. that is impractical.player annoyance in having to click 20 containers instead of one is not called game balance. it is called player annoyance. it is same thing as with having a limit for fleet size.
3/26/2010,"no. as much as i like the subject matter - no.horrible idea.spreading awareness is fine, popping up one of those ""one-time"" logon ads and link to where you can donate money/isk is enough.there's probably enough worthy causes for a new pop-up for each day of the year. disease, conflict and misery rule our planet after all.but please, once i'm actually in game, let me escape into world of internet spaceships - without having to fly a goddamn pink boob-phobos to hammer me with this ""awareness""."
3/26/2010,"this topic is mainly for regular (non wh) exploration, however it can still be applied to all.1. set approximate minimum isk return on radar(hacking) and magnetometric(arc/sal) sites based on system class (hi/low/null sec)reason: everyone knows that exploration is random, however i find it pretty disappointing that sometimes after running 5 radar sites in a row only one gives off good loot, and the average return can be around 30 mil for 0.0 sites. some sites drop 15-20 mil.considering the time it takes to scan down, time to travel and run the sites, running hi sec lvl4 missions can be 2x more profitable with only using one character. magnetometric averages to be even less and more disappointing.suggested: null sec hacking and arc/sal sites should drop minimum of 40 million. random or not, 40 mil is minimum. 2. radar sites materials for building datacores need to be reduced in m3.reason: after running one radar site your cargo runs out of space from materials collected each one is at 1m3. basically if there is another radar in system or one next door, you have to travel back to unload cargo.suggested: reduce size to 0.5 m3. this would give better flexibility.3. magnetometric sites should be more fun and have a chance to drop faction ships bpcs and faction mods bpcs.4. magnetometric sites should not only drop bs sizes tech ii bpc rigs, and besides most of the bpc i got are for mods no one in their right mind would buy in tech ii."
3/26/2010,"any suggestion on how that should be done?the rewards for radar and magnetometric sites are items.the price of those items is set by player, based on the offer and demand on market. if ccp increase the quantity of material available the price will drop so your guaranteed minimum return drop too. the only way i see would be to increase the kinds of item found, adding different, interesting, items. not an easy task."
3/26/2010,please add a checkbox so you can set auto-reject from all but your alliance members. that way you can atleast keep fleet invites etc coming in without worrying about spam in fights.
3/26/2010,"great idea, space is supposed to be big, and tiny ships should be hard to find. so should pos's. they should be able to be put anywhere...as it is now, fly to the moons, fly to the belts, and you can find other people....no guesswork involved..."
3/26/2010,"i support this proposal. i assume that those basic laws of physics should be known to most people here, if not you are a bad capsulier. you operate warp-drives and construct advanced alient tecnnology, have a degree in graviton physics but cannot understand that poses should be anhorable anywhere in orbit around a body with sufficient mass to maintain a proper orbit- sun, planets, moons. if two massive structures are anhored within short distance, gravitational pull they exert on each-other will disrupt their orbits over time, causing them to either fall onto the body or drift off into space. although i would whant to see jita 4-4 drifting off into space"
3/26/2010,except that pos'es can be scanned down for at least a year by now.
3/26/2010,"no no, i completely understand the problem, but as i've said before, the proposed solution is one of the stupidest things i've ever read. how does disabling remote reps on a logged-off ship make any ****ing sense whatsoever? just make a logged-off ship unable to warp away or disappear as long as it's tackled. it's that damn simple."
3/26/2010,this is a much better idea.
3/26/2010,"when a player logs/disconnected, that's like not having the pod pilot in the ship, right? so the ship should only have base stats unless the pilot returns to control the ship.i think this would be more logical than being unable to rr them.or this: because this is just silly."
3/26/2010,supported..
3/26/2010,they could make some news story about how someone crashed a nyx into the station and it blew up... oh wait
3/26/2010,why is this the relevent thread for the topic in the csm wiki about changing the pos missile batteries?
3/26/2010,i find the 1000 entry limit to the wallet and journal system to be highly restrictive. i propose a change to the system that allows wallet entries to be exported and archived outside the client similar to the market and/or chat logs.
3/26/2010,you can do that already. see:
3/26/2010,"dek, mind expanding on your train of thought a bit, im trying to get this proposal workable for the greatest number of people, so clarity would be my friend on this. i assume you are refering to assigning bpo's to wallet devisions / hangers or similar? and then using the proposed wallet function mechanism to track the roi?theoretically i suppose you could also use it to track ship loss rates for various wings within your corp if you are constantly having to replace the ships by buying them for your members on this wallet that would give you a good idea as to performance indices."
3/26/2010,"blueprint originals are blue, blueprint copies are also blue. how bout we make copies green? a contract filter to differentiate the two would be nice as well.benefits: 1. easier to reorganize our hangars the next time we accidentally repackage a can full of prints. 2. less people getting scammed. cons: 1. i'm not a fan of the color green, but i suppose it would be easier on the eyes than orange or brown prints. 2. less people getting scammed."
3/26/2010,search function is your friend. it has been asked a lot of times. doing it would require a major overhaul of the database and ccp don't see that as cost effective for the small advantage it give. look this thread too: let's us distingush bpo from bpc
3/26/2010,"it would be nice if you can train a skill after your current selection if the pre-requesits are being fulfilled before it.for instance, i want a legion, and i have 50 minutes left on mechanic level 5, if i have all requirements except mechanic 5 for 50 minutes, i should be able to stack amarr defense systems after it because the previous selection finished what i needed.rather than having to log on 50minutes later and set up the system skills."
3/26/2010,ahh yes. why hasent this been done yet? may be hard to code. how would it work? can't put in queue if not injected. can't inject if u don't meet prereqs.supported.
3/26/2010,"as many people have said, the only ""barrier"" is you. if you truly wish to join the 0.0 fun then go through eve university, take part of the agony unleashed training courses and you'll be in a nullsec corporation before you reach 1.6 million sp.don't expect to be spoonfed content, you have to go out there and take it yourself."
3/26/2010,op fail detected. you want to go out in 0.0 then go. you dont need shiny rewards to get out there you just need a set of balls. i suggest you go grab a pair.
3/26/2010,"yes, skills are a barrier to 0.0: but not a lack of them.going to 0.0 means that if you want to pvp with any risk involved (aka not run away from even a remotely fair fight), you must leave the learning implants behind, slowing the progression of your character. and it's not like you can later catch up - you can at best resume the speed you had earlier. once you have the skills that training speed doesn't matter as much, clone cost comes into play.i believe that is the main reason 0.0 is so lightly populated compared to high and low sec.however, ccp seems happy with this, most 0.0 players seem happy with things this way. thankfully, there's still high and low sec for those that aren't.and eve continues along."
3/26/2010,"i was going to try and keep it respectful, but spaceship nerd internet tough guy has to show up, so to answer your suggestion - as soon as your mom finishes sucking on them (you know how she can be insistent and just want to keep on sucking) i will take them and go to all others thanks for your replies and i will remove the post as no one else seem to see a problem with such a huge gap between new players and average players, cheers,"
3/26/2010,"as a player who first moved to 0.0 when the best ship i could fly was a t1 cruiser (i flew a celestis out of empire to my new 0.0 home), i agree with the posters who have stated that skill points are not the issue. pilots without a sense of adventure, pilots who value isk and ships over experience... these are the problems. they are individual challenges that only each individual pilot can overcome. skill points are an excuse. take that excuse away, and another will be found."
3/26/2010,"i totaly support a major overhaul of fw. ""stacking"" needs to end. the ""timer bug"" for major plexes needs to be fixed.if you look at igs, you will see most every post are by chracters who are in some way invlolved with or affected by fw. the 0.0 space problems of cva, u'k, star fraction and all the rest are tied into fw. the intaki thread is tied into fw.the wars between the major governmnts, one of the main themes of eve is played out every day...not by mining, not by industry, not by exploration, but by the wars between the governemnts. yeah. change is needed."
3/26/2010,"""there is the titan! in system xy! let's go get it! call the entire fleet!""""na, we can't, we have to fight in a different solar system cause ccp changed fleet fights. we gotta stay in this one.""""i quit."""
3/26/2010,"i support csm on this topic. epic fleet fights make eve unique game. i understand that lag is inevitable, but imo it's fair price to pay. ccp should optimize software and hardware to support even greater fighting forces, not to force them to split. players should chose by themselves what force is appropriate for each engagement."
3/26/2010,"macro miners are a pest, and i completely disagree with redshirt. there is no use of mining ice cause the macro miners are ruining the market for it by mining it 23/7. it was possible to do a bit of a profit, but compared to asteroids, not worth the time. sure, they leave you alone, but if they wouldn't mine at all, no problem as well - just empty space where a macroer was before.no macroers = more people who need to actively play = healthier market.the real problem is how to find a balance between spamming ccp gms and finding out who is a real macroer, cause there is no absolute 100% chance you can tell (even if you can guess very nicely). also, the problem is that ccp doesn't really want to get rid of macroers, cause they are paid accounts. money rules."
3/26/2010,it's almost a sin not to use some cheaper t2 rigs on your pvp ships(for example medium energy locusts on zealots).to the op: i totally agree that gravity capacitor upgrade rigs require to much calibration. we should be able at least to fit 1 t2 and 1 t1 gcu rigs on our covops.
3/26/2010,"i'm gonna prepare a post for the assembly hall suggesting an overhaul of the smuggling miniprofessionregards, lax"
3/26/2010,"what if it simply increases the time it takes for cargo/ship scanners to work? if it prevents scanning entirely then ganking is made too unprofitable, with the side effect of making npc corp hauling alts much more immune."
3/26/2010,imho there are much better things that could be worked on.
3/26/2010,"pos batteries only has 8 thumbs up on assembly hall, far below the amount you said were not enough to look at the special gallante missions (29 was that number.) pos batteries should not be included."
3/26/2010,"cutting and pasting only has 8 thumbs up in assembly hall, far below the requirements you set for the special gallante mission problems. cutting and pasting should not be included."
3/26/2010,"agreed. it's a video game with a teen esrb rating which is;teen'titles rated t (teen) have content that may be suitable for ages 13 and older. titles in this category may contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling, and/or infrequent use of strong language. 'c'mon ccp, just because you're from iceland doesn't mean you have to be a puss :p"
3/26/2010,the 5 minute timer for forum posting was supposed to be removed. why hasnt it been?
3/26/2010,"this.there is nothing wrong with making players ""able"" to play the game along or against vets in a more decent amount of time.what is the op worried about? if you played eve for 4 years already, you are *waaaay* ahead and you won't be competed by a noob - except you act noobish, but that's not the problem of the skills.grow up and let others play too. otherwise, go play an offline game or neopets - that doesn't end as well."
3/26/2010,"at the last csm meeting, ccp explicitly said that suicide ganking is supported and intended gameplay."
3/26/2010,"so basically, what the op proposes, is everything to stay the same (both sides buying/bribing concord), but just throwing money away (in case of skill time, cause both sides would skill up of course).useless complexity-gain to the game."
3/26/2010,"you lose standing til you can't fly any missions anymore, obviously.supported. it would be nice if at least the next mission after declining could be a different one under all circumstances."
3/26/2010,read the above post - there has already been a fix so that if you declined a given mission (e.g. gone berserk) the next mission you are offered by that agent will not be gone berserk. if this doesn't happen then _bug report it_. it doesn't need to be raised by csm - its a bug.if the op is asking for something different then you need to rewrite your idea so it is more understandable.kithran
3/26/2010,"wait wat? i never said the idea needs to eliminate all missions you dont wanna do. i simply said, when i deny an attack of the drones mission, i shouldnt be offered the same mission when i convo the agent for another mission. where did i say i want it to eliminate all missions i prefer not to run? actually, i have run every mission in the game, but sometimes i'm not in the mood to run a certain mission."
3/26/2010,please provide a link to a changelog/devblog/patch notes that says this is the case? as of yesterday i'm still being offered the same mission immediately after declining.
3/26/2010,"i already provided a link to the patch notes that says this change should have been completed years ago with the release of revelations.as has been stated, if you are having this problem, the correct course of action is to file a bug report.ps. also, be sure to check that they are the same mission. there are plenty of missions that are very similar, but could qualify as being a different mission. break their will verses blood raiders is not the same mission as break their will verses guristas."
3/26/2010,i can definitely confirm that agents will quite often offer the same mission that has just been declined. declining a mission doesn't seem to have any particular effect on what mission is offered next.

3/27/2010,"i agree that black ops need a good looking over, but i wouldnt go sofar as to completely rebalance them. (tho i agree with the jumprange changes)i would try to get them in the hands of more people first, then balance them as needed. i dont think a black ops (a t2 tier 1 bs) should cost more than a marauder (a t2 tier 2 bs), especially with demand as low as it is, not to mention the risk in flying a black ops in its intended role.adjust the black ops so that the build costs (at current demand) is somwhere around 300mil. and see what happens first, i think alot of people would be willing to fly them but as they currently are the costs and risk far outwieghs any benefits of flying the damn thing."
3/27/2010,"field commands and eos need major loving, i always wanted to see the absolution have the range bonus of a zealot i know this would make it op but would be fun xdeitherway commands need a buff"
3/27/2010,"something is to be done, but some proposals are just weird. why the hell would you want to give astarte yet another gun when she still dies with its current 7? it won't make this ship that much better as no one sane complains on the dps of it, but rather on the lack of mobility/features. addition of another tanking slot is already way better since 7 guns with 2 damage mods is superior to 8 with just one, and i'm yet to see any setup with 2 mfs which isn't a complete kamikaze-mobile.+1 med for abso is dandy, but kinda corrupts the whole racial concept, as amarr are somewhat supposed to lack mids. i'd vote for another tanking slot, too.changes for sleip and nh look reasonable.more pg and +1 med for nh? hell, yeah"
3/27/2010,i got bc5 for ages but lack of performance coupled with cost is a reason i never trained into any cs. signed!
3/27/2010,"astarte: +1 low slot instead of high. agreed with the rest. good post.also, as far as the eos, all they need to change to make it not completely useless (like, literally less than black=ops useless) is give it back 5 heavys. the massive nerf was from 7 guns + 5 heavys to 3 heavys and 5 guns. just give back the drones, keep off the guns (**** take another for 4). awesome tanking ishtar?"
3/27/2010,"thanks for the support so far guys! i have updated the thread with the other suggestions noted as ''alternative boost'' on the absolution and the astarte. the reason for it fon revedhort is because i believe the astarte was made to be a pure gank boat and i didn't want to make it to similar to the others and try and keep it unique for what it was supposed to do, the racial concept. perhaps it would do better with another low slot than a high, it's hard to say as that would depend a lot on circumstances, either would be a major upgrade to it though :) it's a major pain trying to balance this ship though...^^ as for the abso the 4th med i took as an inspiration from the harbinger, im a bit afraid another low would make way for too big tanks for a bc class ship, but running some more calculations and theoretical fittings of said change i can see it work :) skylar: remember to check the 'i agree with proposal box'! that said i believe the eos as a fleet command ship should not have 5 heavy drones, it could use 4 heavies though, along with other changes to make it a more used fleet command. it's main problem is that it's bonuses are made for running along with recon ships, which it is incapable of doing in it's current state."
3/27/2010,"agree to the op, especially in the hp boost part."
3/27/2010,decently supported. by the way this is my first supporting anything. normally i just tell people why the subject is bad but this is one of the few really good proposals on this forum. more like this please.
3/27/2010,full support. enough fitting for tank + gank + one ganglink.
3/27/2010,i need this.
3/27/2010,man if eve had this things would feel so much more interesting again. traders would have more fun challenges trying to transport good. pirates will get more pew pew. bounty hunting may become more viable again to kill high ranking pirates. defiantly bump.
3/27/2010,cool
3/27/2010,"1: clever - labeling the space that pirates ""occupy"" but complicated with the ownership of the real empires. imagine star wars; there are seedy sides of tatooine, but its all owned by the empire.2: yes, but they'd have to be general pirates and not really faction standing-like; i'm as hated with the serpentis as i am with the gallente.3: too tight-fisted on valuable markets, leave the ore here.4: nah, fly whatever you want, wherever you want down here in low-sec.5: i like it, but it would have to come with a bounty change too (contracted kill-rights and minimal bounties and other changes) to open up opportunities for the anti-pirates and such do-gooders lol. we get smuggling, they get bounty hunting. fair trade. (if the potential profits say so)6: i'm iffy on the npc riff-raff going on there since us pirates don't really care about stuff like that (i'm thinking like cosmos agents but pirates right? ehhhh, seems gimmicky)7: fw makes this viable already honestly, since you should only care about the borders if you are in fw anyway.8: supported only if the pos had a module to use the illegal drugs to make boosters, only anchor-able in low sec.9: nah, low sec is too juicy a passage to null sec to pass up, and some of us pirates take great advantage of that fact.10: 100% support.alot of people are saying how there arnt enough people coming to lowsec [established] but people need to have a reason to go there [established] im not interested in getting more carebears to wander in to get ganked let me stop you here. this isn't necessarily a lie as much as it does need to go with other changes. elsewhere there was suggested a attacker/loot ratio established and this in conjunction with low-sec changes would usher in a time when, to be profitable as a pirate, you need to be skilled with tiny, 2,3 man squads to take down much bigger prey like faction fit bs with insane tanks. that's the only way or reason changes like yours, mine and other suggested ones would work in low sec. as for turf war however, if you are looking for that sort of thing, really just go to 0.0. if you are looking to prey on the all-powerful high sec people (who will start missioning in low sec in 2s and 3s with changes like this) then these changes are the way to start.good stuff, supported!"

3/27/2010,yeah its a good idea if just for clarity's sake. never confused the myself but good to see how many types of something i have without having to squint haha. just a very minor graphical change can save on slip-up as well as make it easier in the e-war box on the target whether they are scramming you or not (should you have notifications off or something).

3/27/2010,"this actually sounds pretty neat, i wasn't aware a system like this was in use by other games already."
3/27/2010,"on one hand this is pretty good since it reduces (or stops) hacking but then on the other hand it also stops corp / alliance theft while i am not a thief in anyway it is fun to read about legit thefts , personally i prefer the wow keychain mechanic i mean whats to stop a hacker from just self destructing your pod 50 times til you are 900k when he doesnt get your stuff?protect the account, eitherway supported ;)"
3/27/2010,aww gee i hadn't even thought of that. that would be pretty lame :(
3/27/2010,i never thought it would apply to corp hangers personally.
3/27/2010,"1) it wouldn't help new players at all, because they would have to train it first.2) it would annoy old players by having them spend a week and half training something that doesn't actually let them play the game any better.3) poker is a zero sum game, and there are definitely winners and losers.so, in conclusion, it's a bad idea and you don't know what you're talking about."
3/27/2010,"huh how did you get that idea? me personally (and many others) would be in favour of just removing all learning skills and changing the attributes so they are on lvl 5 for everyone (or 5 basic 4 advanced, or only remove the advanced ones). this would effectively only hurt the people who already trained those skills, so myself. just because it wouldnt help me in any way doesnt mean i cant see that we would be better off without them."
3/27/2010,"the learning skill tree is just fine, in my humble opinion. back in the day..you started out with nothing. i agree no more addions to learning area of the tree, directly. of course as new tech is introduced, yes training to related skills. may be required. the learning skill tree is necessary. its what makes this game different an superior to all other games. it the big difference. remove the learning curve, would destroy the debth this game has.eve set the mark high upon the tree of knowledge, so far, no other game has come close to what eve is.if you want a lotor type game, with no real skill training required, then go play sto an lotr. but leave eve alone. if you are not up to the task, get out of the sand box.all eve needs is full surface worlds access, like in swg, to walk around on, with catinas to go into, to watch naked dancers to heal our sic minds. if u can't woop a guy in space, then kill him on the ground or in a bar. more women would play eve, if they could strut about in attractive gear. expand skill tree to meet the new tech requirements, as it developes. don't speed it up, but allow training 3 skills at same time, at same speed as 1 skills, with maybe a isk penalty."
3/27/2010,"leave it to a liberal minded galente player, to want everything with out earning it. lol removing the skill tree would ruin the game. eve is not a mindless shooter. the skill tree is a important part of the over all game of eve. if you are a lazy player, don't want to earn your bones, then eve is not for you. just beam out, and leave the sand box alone. anybody that talks about doing to eve what was done to star wars galaxy, should be set to red right away, and a plex card bounty placed on their head...im joking of course. eve is not broken. in eve u get nothing for nothing. like real life, u learn, then earn."

3/27/2010,stabs are optional now anyways since hics were introduced.hics are a nerf for stabs so the original nerf can be undone safelly.added to that losing a slot to a wcs means weeker gank or tank there seems no harm in making them an optional module.
3/27/2010,"i agree that maybe stabs need to be looked at since they have become pretty much useless in non-highsec since the introduction of hics, but outright removing one of their penalties is no solution to any problem that still needs inventing."
3/27/2010,lately i have been seeing ships in dock while mission running. why couldn't there be a way to take the ship with some marines or target it and salvage them for a faction fitting or the trit used to make them. right now there is nothing that drops on any of them.
3/27/2010,it's because they are large collidable structures that look like ships.
3/27/2010,"eve i pitched as a 'hardcore' game where players are allowed to scam, steal and do a whole bunch of things that would not be tolerated in any other mmo, the universe is supposed to be 'dark and dirty'. but with all of these freedoms we lack even a basic profanity filter, something all other major mmos have over us. i cant cheat ppl in any other games, but at least i can tell them to **** off, because the potentially offensive bits are filtered, and if thiere not filtered then its the players choice to hear my words of wisdomwhats worse is the already busy gms in eve are tasked with filtering the chats, i can scam somone for everything they ever worked for in the game with no repercussions, but if tell them im gonna **** thier mother the gms not onlt have to deal with a petition, but i get the stfuhammer. thich is not an ideal way to treat a player (customer), and not really a good use of the gms limited time.so we need user-settable profanity filters, just as like are in other modern mmos. and the gms need to be taken off babysitting duty. allowing eve to truly be the 'dark and dirty' game it claims to be.tldr version: eve needs to have chat filters."

3/27/2010,"it won't mitigate blobbing even by a little because like they said before, loot is not gonna be even remotely close to a top priority to a blob. it's all about getting a perfect killboard score in a game for bragging rights and the more numbers u have compared to your enemy, the less skill/input required to survive and the less likely u and your ceo will have to cope with even one loss. simple as that."
3/27/2010,"i just don't see this as a good argument to continue to reward blobbing with just as much loot as non-blob pvp. i tend to think economic implications effect behavior. but even if you want to deny this as regards to blobbers there would still be the added benefit of *doing* small gang pvp. this plan has a carrot and a stick. arguments about blobber mentality only apply to the stick part of it, not the carrot. are you saying its impossible that those who like to do smaller scale pvp might not do more of it if they could recover more loot that way? if you just want to argue that economic incentives don't work in eve, then i guess we will just have to agree to disagree.if you think blobbing is what makes eve great then continue to be in favor of the current mechanic. if on the other hand you think blobbing makes eve worse and tends to destroy something that is better - smaller scale pvp - then you should support proposals that promote what you like about the game."
3/27/2010,"so you are advocating for a complete overhaul of the killmail system so that you can achieve an admitedly negligible effect?or are you advocating for decreasing the isk gained from popping haulers/shuttles/etc via camps and suicide ganks?considering the serious lack of substance to the idea here, or in your original post:"
3/27/2010,"well put it this way, you could implement it, but it wouldn't do jack ****."
3/27/2010,"actually, the idea is not that bad i must say, it would strongly help pirates, as they will get much more drops, (nearly twice). yet, i know it will not discourage blobbing."
3/27/2010,"lol blobbing is not a form of ""ass-kicking"" in any way. you spew vomit onto the target and they have no chance to survive at all. they're pussies not pvpers.this though: ""actually, the idea is not that bad i must say, it would strongly help pirates, as they will get much more drops, (nearly twice). yet, i know it will not discourage blobbing.""blobs = failpirates = win, a profession that gets nerfed harder and harder every time i turn the **** around. ccp has literally spit in the faces of pirates new-eden -wide and gotten away with it cause the easier they make this game, the more subs they'll get."
3/27/2010,because ganking newbies in caracals and badgers all day is pro-only amirite?
3/27/2010,"complete overhaull? i dont know why you would think that. the killmail system in place already gives the majority of info needed. if they tried to do something based on a comparison of fleet sizes that would take some extra doing. but my *guess* would be that this would be little more than a tweak to the loot drop mechanic. but more importantly i really dont think assembly hall is the place for people to speculate how technically difficult a change may or may not be. it seems to me that we need to decide if we want the change. ccp can then discuss with the csm if there are large technical barriers. of course if there are large technical barriers then sure this idea could be tabled. but i would point out that i noticed the occasional bug in the killmail system anyway, so regardless of this idea an overhaul may be in order. negligible effect? im not claiming this will fix blobbing. but i also dont think this change is negligible. look at some killboards and do some of the math. if a typical pvp ship drops 20 mill in mods and the drop is about half the value of the total mods then this means we are talking about a 40 million isk swing per ship. if the average drop is 10 mill and about half mods drop its a 20 mill swing. i wouldnt call this negligible. ok yeah i dont know what the actual numbers are from any statistically significant study but just eyeballing the costs of many pvp ship mods i think most people can see this can really be significant. if you disagree use your own numbers but i dont think this is negligible.certainly it is in line with the changes that the csm typically suggests. it may even be on the more significant side of the scale. this is not a negligible change. haulers and shuttles? ccp can value haulers and shuttles however they want. or they can leave them out of this new mechanism entirely! the change is to promote smaller group pvp not to effect these other things. lets stay focused on that.im glad you mention that you argued with me in other posts on completely different issues. i noticed a few other naysayers in this thread and the one in features and ideas had disagreements with me in the past on entirely different issues. im not necessarily saying they all just need some butt paste (after all it may just be a coincidence that we 1. have enough of an interest in the same exact topics despite ther the fact they have nothing to do with each other, and yet 2. we always disagree on the conclusions.) but i cant rule that out either. so the fact that a few folks who have argued with me before in the forums on different issues show up in these threads and try to attack my post without really addressing the content of the idea, is not really going to make me think the idea isnt a good one. at least you address the idea i propose, which i appreciate. others well. read mclevers contribution to this thread and i think you see my point."
3/27/2010,"i really wish you wouldn't have pointed that out. now that ccp realizes the proposal may help pirates, it's doomed. btw i don't think this will just help ""pirates"" in the strict sense - those who attack pve'ers. instead i see this as helping ""pirates"" in the broader sense - just about everyone in low sec who likes to pvp there - with the possible exclusion of fw. if you pvp in low sec enough your sec status will drop regardless of whether you attack mission runners or other pvp ships. (again fw pilots aside) the thing is it seems most of the pirate fights (again using ""pirate"" in this more general sense) i see in low sec often have smaller scale engagements. of course there are plenty of exceptions. but i tend to think more people who are in low sec pirate corps would benefit from this change. indeed i think low sec pvp would benefit in general. but by saying this i know i am spelling the death knell for this idea. still, doesn't mean you can't support it."
3/27/2010,"i do like the idea don't get me wrong, but it wouldn't really change people's behaviour one jot outside of a few circumstances.'blobbing' in my mind is this: there is a target(s) in your system/space and you assemble a gang to counter it, you don't think you have enough so you wait until you get enough to utterly crush it. maybe people will be skewed towards taking a bit more risk in these conditions...5 man gang comes into your space and you get 20 x's straight off the bat: not blobbing.10 man roaming gang happens across a ratting raven: not blobbing.badger strays into a large gatecamp: not blobbing.400 man fleet is raised to take a strategic objective despite the fact that the defenders can only bring 200: not blobbing."
3/27/2010,"ok first off let me say that i would love for there to be less blobbing. i dont think anyone is against that. let me also say that on a gut reaction level, before reasoned consideration, this plan sounds good. however, the ""devil is in the details""... which you have consitantly refused to elaborate upon or consider meaningfully. this is why i dont support the idea (atm). now to clarify some things that were evidently lost in translation:1)the overhaul issue- i assume ""ccp should discuss with csm if there are large technical barriers"" to indicate that you thought i was talking about specifically hardware (server load)/programing problems. i was not. i am arguing that accomplishing your idea would require a major re-work in conception of what a killmail (thus loot modifier) is. perhaps an example would be easier to follow here. lets assume that there is no technical problem in implamenting your idea:situation a)- your 5man hac gang jumps into a 20man mix gang... loot tables are modified via ""involved parties"" list so each kill shows 5 hac vs. whatevership. to fix the problem you then add ""fleet chan"" numbers and ship types into the equation so that the 5man gang is not penalized. ok, still assuming no technical issues lets see the effect on another common engagement under these new rules:situation b)- you are in said 5man hac gang and decide to engage a solo hac on your own. it is :goodfight: because nobody jumped in, but your loot table is modified (again)by virtue of your being in a gang even though the gang was not involved.or how about the fact that there are nuetrals who involve themselves in fights?which side do they ""effect""? especially when thier actions are not logged on the killmail at all? as i said, the devil is in the details, and details matter to a community of rational beings (whom are effected by any change).2)on the word ""negligable""- i think you misconstrued what i was talking about, though this is perhaps my own fault for not clarifying. i agree that the effects on loot can be considerable. what i meant is that your change will have a negligable effect on the problem. you yourself admit that it will not ""fix"" the problem. and you have been given arguments why it wont act as a strong mitigating force. you are asking for changes,therefore, that dont accomplish anything/much in relation to the problem.... what you do accomplish (and i consider this to be perhaps a gooood thing...perhaps) is make pvp a viable alternative to pve for isk generation...for the solo and small gang players. as it stands now pvp is either a necessity to protect isk faucets/assets, or ""for fun"" and therefore the isk made is accidental and not integral to the game play (people run around solo and in small gangs without it being as ""lucrative"" so this obviously isnt a driving factor). it just makes it so that a ""pirate"" doesnt need to have some alt making isk for him to fuel his pvp.p.s.- alluding to the possibility that people are arguing aginst your ideas purely out of spite does not, in any way, advance your position in a rational manner. but again i applaud your use of rhetorical devices as a means to gain support. i must, for the sake of reasoned discourse, make sure to point them out however. its not personal.edit: added clarifications"
3/27/2010,"larkonisi see what you are saying here. your defining blobbing as intentionally shipping up way above what you believe your opponent has. to the extent blobbing has a negative connotation i would agree with what you say. i guess though i might say other of those situations involved blobbing but i would agree there is nothing wrong with doing that. if you have to defend say a pos in a worm hole that your corp spent months setting up then yeah bring all the firepower you can. blob them. nothing wrong with that. but putting aside what blobbing is and is not, and whether its right or wrong let me explain how i think this proposal will have some effect on the game.im talking with corpmates. we can either join a huge fleet with other corps or just go roaming ourselves. if we go in the big feet we will likely be larger than the vast majority of fleets in the area. accordingly, economically speaking we will be taking very little risk by involving our ships in this endeavor. not no risk but compared to flying in a small gang where we know there will be other larger fleets in the area its considerably less. if we decide to go out in a gang of 2-8 and roam around (i realize this may seem a very small group to many people but there are places where this is done.) we run a much higher chance of losing our ships. so from an economic perspective this is not a great way to roll. my proposal would give an upside to this sort of gang forming versus piling into the larger fleet. yeah people would still say we are more likely to lose our ships doing this and they would likely be right. but at least you could say well if we do say catch a battleship with our bc and 3 cruisers and 2 frigs we will get a decent amount of loot. instead of that bs dropping 10 mill in loot to be divided by 40 it might drop 50 mill divided by 6. (assuming under the current mechanic it would drop 30 million) so for that gang of 6 thats an extra 8 mill or so for that kill. ok its going to be a long haul before you can get slave implants doing this, but it is some incentive to join a smaller group instead of a huge fleet. i dont think its negligible. and it rewards the extra risk you take.so you have a bit added incentive to go small group. this should influence you to do it more often. heres the thing, if it influences you, it will influence others. and if it influences others to do it, then you are going to have more smaller gangs to fight in and against. also consider this: you might have a solo fight with an equal class ship ( lets say cruiser class) that you are doing ok against. instead of calling in all your gang to obliterate him you may want to gamble a bit to make some extra loot. ok most wont do that unless they are pretty sure they can win. and if they start to go down they will call in the calvary. but still there is some risk and some thought before you immediately decide to call in the 2 blackbirds and 4 megathrons to finish off that rupture. how many people would make those sorts of calls? i dont know, but i know i would. kill the guy solo and have more loot for the gang to split. immediately warp in the gang and kiss that odd faction mod that might have dropped goodbye. would one really be able to make isk at pvp if they were really good? well im not saying that either but i would think many good small gang pvpers can see some advantage here. its hard to argue against the economics and deny the possibility that this would boost small scale pvp . how exactly it would play out i cant necessarily say. but again just saying i dont think it will work is not really a good reason to reject it. not unless you are *sure* it wont boost small scale pvp. and i think people who say that are fighting basic economic principles. so in the end unless there is a big downside to offset this benefit (or at least potential benefit) the rational thing to do is go with it."
3/27/2010,"yes give pirates even more reason to dishonour ransom by higher loot drops.one day pirates will realise they dont have anyone but themselves to blame for their lack of targets.regarding the topic, so if 5 pirates kill me when flying solo they get most of the loot. yet when we would attack a 200 men fleet with 100 people we wouldnt get loot since we are blobbing? that doesnt make sense to me."
3/27/2010,"ok your analysis assumes that ccp would take into account the whole fleet that you were in. when i was posting in response to larkonis i was not doing that. (although i do think that possibility is something the csm/ccp should consider) but let me just explain the plain vanilla version. so in situation a assuming all 5 hacs show on the kill mail the loot would be adjusted accordingly. if that means the killmail is of a frigate then there would be very little loot dropping. if it was a battleships somewhat more. if the hac gang started winning the engagement they may want to stop all firing on one primary and attacking individual ships to get more loot. that would be up to them. situation b  if you are the only one on the kill mail then its solo and you only compare classes of ships.neutrals  such as remote repair helping one side? that might be bit more difficult. since i think neutral remote repair needs to be reworked as it is i would be fine with saying if you get killed despite neutral remote repair all your loot will automatically drop. <U+F04A> but im sure the csm can come up with other suggestions. for example, depending on the class of the ship remote repairing the ship getting remote repaired would have x amount added to it. while i agree this stuff will need to be done i dont think this is anything insurmountable."
3/27/2010,"you are right that very little loot would drop in your 100 versus 200 battle assuming people follow primaries. (i dont think this will change the practice of having everyone shoot at a primary although if it did i think that might be a good thing.) i accept that this is a downside of the proposal. but my proposal would be a reason not to get into a 100 man fleet to begin with. if you have good reason to get into a hundred man fleet such as to defend some important resource you, of course, can but you just wont get allot of loot. if you dont have any really good reason to get into a 100 man fleet other than to blob a gate well now you have an additional incentive to try out smaller scale pvp."
3/27/2010,"like any 100-man fleet is assembled under the premise of loot. this will not change a thing, if people want to achieve an objective they'll do it whatever the cost.your idea is fatally flawed. it's been shot down in a previous subforum so you tried again, and you're receiving even less support."
3/27/2010,"i dont think a badger has ever come to where we live, friendo. and the noobs we kill always come back for more... shall we ignore them for you? grow a brain boss."
3/27/2010,this.
3/27/2010,"it surely won't fix blobs, but why reject the proposal merely on these considerations?the idea is just to give some carrot to those of us who don't blob."
3/27/2010,"i honestly think it will encourage even smaller gang pvp. it wont stop the blobs by any means cause russians cant even read this lol, but at least it will give small gangs more reason to go out and fight, knowing majority of mods/loot will be awaiting any kills they make. i know i would make an effort to roam more looking for targets :d"
3/27/2010,"another way to handle anti-""blob"" mechanics would be to make it so that weapons won't fire if there's something between your ship and the target. asteroid, station or ship in the way? your weapons won't fire that cycle. no idea how difficult this would be to implement, server-load wise, but it would cut down on the damage one ship takes from a big fleet if that fleet is getting in the way of itself."
3/27/2010,you can't even put two gscs next to each other.nobody is going to make a fortune mining into a gsc. they are incredibly impractical to use. even ignoring the fact that having more space would be helpful...gscs are anchored. meaning in order to even move along in the belt you need to unanchor and reanchor it. i happen to like my corp. but i can't expect the corp to bloody hold my hand. is that the kind of corp you're in?so what you are saying is that you just want miners to be defenseless. because atm gscs are too impractical to even put to use.
3/27/2010,have to support my own idea duh :))
3/27/2010,boobies
3/27/2010,"ok we've the new mail ""system"" ... which still lacks basic features.we have new labeling system but we are unable to send to a label simply by clicking on its name and send message from there to everyone in it. that would be a quick fix i think.assigning colors. that would be a global thing. we are not in four bit century anymore. sixty four bit anyone? why not to give me a choice from all the colors available?just my thoughts."
3/27/2010,"re-work the mail system from the ground up, i think. put back the old system, with a few minor changes. i don't really care about the whole realistic-browser-like format, i just want the simple mail back. :c"
3/27/2010,i don't want a realistic system. just to be able to send bulk mail to anyone in the label.
3/27/2010,"yes this would be real-world realistic, but its not realistic in terms of the game-play for anyone who can't get on to lay claim to missions immediately after downtime.you simply can't expect people to be happy 12, 18, or 20 hours past downtime when they get home from work and try to play only to find that all the missions have been exhausted by people closer to greenwich."
3/27/2010,as drake and amberlyn insinuated this would be easily monopolized by people who log in right after dt (on the respawn days) with thier 3-4 accounts full of alts with nothing but the standings req. to access the agent.i would support an idea that found a way around this however.
3/27/2010,isnt there enough diversity for you mission peope? isnt there zero risk vs. 100% pure reward for running missions and never having to risk anything? they should cut all the lvl 4 missions but one and make every missioner run the same one over and over and over again until your eyes bleed. imo.
3/27/2010,"you make some valid points. radar - increase datacore counts to help fix the isk return.magno - i'd be happy with different interesting items, ie factions bpcs :d"
3/27/2010,i might be wrong here but i am sure you get the option to reject people who arent on your address book where you can add corps and i think alliances on it therefore spam will only be from alliance members only :)or you could just charge people not on your addressbook ;)
3/27/2010,"set your cspa to a high number and add your alliance to addressbook.ccp seem to be taking the position that ""if someone is blue you must want them to see all your contacts"".so you'll want to test and be aware of how evegate behaves when using addressbook like this."
3/27/2010,the csm agreed unanimous that limiting the sandbox invalidates the sandbox label.
3/27/2010,"yeah, i see that problem, too. the module is not supposed to make ships 100% unscannable, it should just reduce the probability of a successful scan which would work the same way as your proposal - it would take longer to get a scanresult."
3/27/2010,it is totally discretionary. the items she has chosen are worth discussing and she has at least posted them 24 hours in advance. thumbs up.you can only hope that the members of the csm interested in pve awaken. and in a big gift from the easter bunny.
3/27/2010,"i am hoping that venkul's mineral sourcing information request is included. with over 50 supports out of less than 60 replies, it would seem to qualify."
3/27/2010,"i have written (today) to z0d about that, as his platform say he is a industrial expert. so we can hope that if it is not added this time it will be added next time. even if ccp reply was ""we don't want to divulge the data"" a simple reply saying ""we have them"" will be welcome. sometime i fear that they don't gather those data normally but only for special projects."
3/27/2010,ive updated it as a proposal here
3/28/2010,supported
3/28/2010,once again i support this effort.
3/28/2010,"something i noticed, panther out of all black ops has the lowest targeting range.at level 5 it has 60km targeting range. pretty suck.i think ccp took hull bss targeting range and decreased it by 20%. why such penalty i don't know, this needs to improve imo."
3/28/2010,boost!
3/28/2010,"once they will be able to outtank normal bs they will be worthy for use in bigger battles.... at least for fcs. still can be used in local skirmishes as the wild card, but the pricetag is horrible. another idea is to make them t1 so u can insure them ..... here we go .... u will see them much more on the field."
3/28/2010,supported. this and a boost to local repairsystem bonusses (10% instead of 7.5% to armor rep amount) would make the astarte so much more useful.
3/28/2010,even if they aren't meant to be hac on steroids field command ships need some redoing.
3/28/2010,"removing it in favour of a 10% armor (or even shield, ha ha) hp bonus would make it so much more useful, honestly.in fact, it would be a very interesting ship with a extra high, a tad more grid and armor hp bonus, being basically something with the gank and buffer of a bs with t2 resists on top (but minus the range and utility highs), and would make a lot of sense in certain types of gangs."
3/28/2010,"i don't like that idea. moves the game once more towards buffer tanks. better give all them rep/boost bonused ships the same bonus to received rr.otherwise they would have the same issues as the nidhoggur.this way hype and mael can keep all their guns, are fine for solo and and in gangs paired with logsitics."
3/28/2010,this is in fact a very good idea.
3/28/2010,+1.....fix it please
3/28/2010,yes please
3/28/2010,.
3/28/2010,"well it isn't my area of expertise but considering nobody else has raised it yet i'll put it forward for the next meeting in 2 weeks time.thanks for adding supports to the issue, it adds weight when talking to ccp."
3/28/2010,thank you.
3/28/2010,looks like overwhelming support up in the house here! we should get some more of that.-liang
3/28/2010,"great idea but you need to be a little bit less one sided on this topic. on top of that members should be here to debate not simply to say ""no"" if you say ""no"" state explain your views. personally i like the idea but it needs to have a few other changes made in order to balance it. i understand where all the combat pilots are coming from, that you are ""paying"" concord to fight. that is absolutely true, and from a couple of the other posts they use the examples of real-life wars. not to be the barer of bad news but no nation has ever had to pay a ""world governing body"" to go to war with another country nor have they ever had to ""formally"" declare war on another country before attacking it or wait 24 hours after declaring war to attack another nation. this is after all a game not the real world so using real world examples is pointless. now back to the idea of only allowing a corporation that is declaring war against another corporation the ability to attack in high-sec with out the declaration of war not being consensual. again great idea just needs a little bit more balancing. for example if you look at empire space right now there is very little differences besides the fact that capital ships can't jump into high-sec, and concord isn't as strong in low-sec as it is in high-sec. well, with that in mind why couldn't concord enforce the fact that a declaration of war must be consensual for attacks to be made in high-sec. the fact is they easily could, however you would basically turn high-sec into a safe-zone. as we all know pvpers ""hate"" safe-zones with a passion. it would also basically turn low-sec more of a combat zone then it already is. so what would also have to be changed is the securities in low-sec. face it empire space is empire space. its roughly 1/10th the size of null sec so why not actually give the police a set of teeth to defend that section of space. basically make high-sec into a safe-zone unless the declaration of war is mutual. once that happens you can kill any where you wish. low-sec gets a security increase which would make some of the high-sec missions that put you into low-sec safe again for all the pveers. also it would spread out the empire space players, an increase in minerals meaning cheaper ships, an increase in tech ii and tech iii minerals for again cheaper ships and modules. would give the industrial corps more of a purpose in this game rather then just being ""targets"" or lambs to the slaughter. and for all those combat pilots the battles would be truly impressive. you would end up getting battles that had 100+ pilots. mutual wars though both sides take losses and get kills the battles are truly epic being that ""both"" sides actually want to fight. how many combat corps actually spend most of they're time sitting on gate camps for a couple of kills or camping a station with 3 or 4 war targets. i know i have, and i know i've taken losses for fighting with others. it happens the trick is to ""enjoy"" the game. so below is the changes that would have to be made in order for this to work1.) low-sec would have to receive a more aggressive police force one that would actually prevent or limit ganking to the ganking force taking losses but still have the ability to run from concord if needed.2.) in order to fight with out concord interference in high-sec the declaration of war would have to be mutual.now i know what the null sec guys are saying. ""this will force the gate camp pirates into null"" well it would make null sec what its truly suppose to be ""out-law"" space. i'm actually working on another purposal for you guys in null sec that will make your lives much much easier. but in the end we all know its up to ccp whether or not these requests are implemented."
3/28/2010,"eve is survival of the fittest.starting a corp takes a certain level of responsibility. if you can't keep yourselves afloat through a war, maybe you just aren't ready to own a corp yet.members who are d-bags in local will attract random wardecks. if you are incapable of policing your members and maintaining recruitment standards maybe you aren't ready to own a corp yet. if the shoe fits here.if you are wardecked, often a lil bit of diplomacy can resolve the war. if you have no rl communication skills, maybe you aren't ready to own a corp yet.corp members often expect a certain level of security and defense from their corp. if you are unable to provide security for your members in one way or another, maybe you aren't ready to own a corp yet.naming your corp 'super elite turbo mining corp' or something similar will attract greifers. if you can't come up with a better name, maybe you aren't ready to own a corp yet.rogue"

3/28/2010,i support this idea!
3/28/2010,"it's a little thing but it would be a major conveniance. you got several of the same ship, but they are fit differently. how do you know which one is which with out physically getting in them. this can take a while what with the 30 seconds between ship changes. thoughts?"
3/28/2010,i agree. it's a terrible nuisance with the session timer.
3/28/2010,agreed =d
3/28/2010,"yes. for some things i'm able to keep track by using a system to name the ships -- a certain set of names for each set of functions. but trying to remember which of several ittys in different has the cloaking device on it when i'm multiple jumps away and wish to go fetch the cloaked itty that i haven't used for several weeks, ...being able to click on the ship in assets and look at its fittings would be very useful."
3/28/2010,"i like this idea.i don't understand why people are so against training learning skills - it's not like you are forced to 'waste your time' training these skills - just don't train them if you don't like themit seems to me that a lot of players want the siege tanks and other end-game apps w/out putting in the time pooling your resources, to borrow from starcraft.i support a skill that speeds up my training even more. i'm in this game for the long-haul"

3/29/2010,yes. please. quitting eve or becoming blind is not a choice i want to have to make.
3/29/2010,that's an interesting idea but can you imagine the ****storm from the caldari whine squad if rails bypassed shields (for instance) to any degree?
3/29/2010,it wouldn't just bypass shields but armor as well depending upon what defense is still applicable. i believe thats how railguns were intended to function(and actually did) a long time ago.i think it was the difficulty in calculating the damage that resulted in it's demise since shields are never really at zero so any incoming railgun round took a much more complex calculation than the brute force approach of lasers and projectiles.there are many things that are in eve that are relics from old design concepts that got trashed. the propulsion type of a tech 1 ship is irrelevant yet they are different from race to race. if i remember correctly ships used to also have some of all 4 types of sensors with a race based preference like they do now. those sensors were based on the concept of functioning similar to their name.gravimetric(caldari) would be better at targeting and tracking ships with higher mass concurrent with heavy armor.magnetometric(gallante) would be better at targeting and tracking ships with higher em output concurrent with heavy shielding.what they had planned with ladar and radar are probably more balanced though the much higher resolution of ladar could be responsible for the failings of projectiles for much of their life in eve. in the end the grandiose concept was probably scrapped because of difficulty in calculating the information and server load caused by doing so.this mangled relic has led to the balancing problems facing ewa. amongst other things like missiles having aoe once upon a time. if they had aoe now the raven wouldn't be the preferred mission running ship and would be nearly unusable in highsec without significant alterations to how aoe agro mechanics work.anyways just thought i would throw it out but don't see it happening thats for sure.
3/29/2010,"just so that i am clear on your point here (not stating any of my thoughts on the matter yet)-if people fly the mega over the rohk because it is an armor tank, and more people fly the mega than a pest, then if the rokh was an armor tank the ""law of large numbers"" would be: apoc>rohk>pest>>>>>>>>>>>> megais this correct? or are there other mitigating factors regarding ships choice?

3/29/2010,"with the exception of freighters which are very slow in warp, when 2 ships enter warp across most systems they will arrive at the outgate with little difference in journey time. despite the 3au/s : 6au/s gap the ships spend too little time at this speed for it to really show in their transit time across any system except the very large 100au plus systems, most of their travel time is spent in accelerating and deccelerating. this limits the effectiveness of pursuit of larger ships by smaller ships. i propose that the differential between ship warp speeds is widened, by slowing down bs to 1.5au/s for example, and also that the acceleration and decceleration to max warp speed become more differentiated by either ship mass or class, larger ships taking longer for both than smaller/lighter ships. this will give small ships some of the advantage they should have when it comes to pursuit without effecting any other aspect of the current mechanics."
3/29/2010,"imho the balance is fine, it gives the small ships a little edge over the large ships, but also leaves room for the larger ships to get out."

3/30/2010,"well hrmm... you say ""law of large numbers"" is one thing and the other guy says its something different. this makes it seem like the ""law"" is not so much a ""law"" as a something quite subjective ( i would say ""theory"" but this word is usually misconstrued by the general populous).perhaps both of you should give some evidence for claiming that snipe bs rankings (by use)are what you claim them to be. (i am not agreeing/disagreeing with either of you yet...just very keen on differentiating facts from opinions)"
3/30/2010,"the main factor for the differentiation is pilot race preference. both me and bagehi fly in the south (providence, catch and curse), but in different alliances so our data might be skewed due to alliance preferences and reimbursement schemes.another issue is also sp available. for caldari pilots if you have specced hybrids, it is much easier to train gallente bs than amarr or minmatar. bonus point for this path is the rattlesnake, of course. if you haven't trained hybrids at all, then it is widely suggested to go laser + amarr bs (getting the nightmare as a bonus).the caldari-> minmatar path is also available but there is no bonus faction bs to act as a lure. the support skills should be as high as possible, so the fact that some minnie ships shield tank should not be used as a bonus point. you would train those skills anyway.in the end, what happens is that most caldari pilots that wish to take part in sniper fleets, crosstrain to amarr or gallente. those that have high hybrid skills, go gallente (like i have done, 6 days left to get there).after a brief review of the major fleet battles in my alliance kb (about a month ago) ship distribution was:1.6 apoc for every pest1.5 megas for every pest0.3 rokhs for every pesti cannot give a better resolution for this data, the sample size is 4-5 roughly 600-700 pilot fleets (-a-, u'k, sys-k) mainly living in the south (sansha rats don't like lasers at all). that means that i was looking at roughly 200-300 bs fleets each time with the rest being support, tackle, capitals and supercapitals.of course, if you have better and more data, please do come forward.edit: law of large numbers is a statistical theorem:"
3/30/2010,"for the sake of quantifying the race trained bias in tagami's numbers there i worked out (based on 2007 data) how it compares what race's ships are used overall in the game, averaging out capital and t1 data from here:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.from this we can see that for most things eve tends to favor caldari and gallente quite heavily making tagami's results all the more alarming. it shows a 17% increase in people favoring the apoc compared to people who trained amaar from the start, a 4.5% increase for the pest a 1% loss for the mega and a staggering 21.5% loss for the rokh, in spite of it being designed as 'a preimier sniper'. if a ship designed wholly for sniping is appearing in such pitiful numbers compared to it's competitors who are either less focused on sniping or simply general purpose ships then there's clearly something very wrong, i'd argue, as well as others here that it's the weapons system."
3/30/2010,"i am refereing to something different than tagami. he is saying ""no one flies the rokh, some people fly the tempest, people fly the megathron, and a lot of people fly apocs""i am saying fcs request ships in this order: apoc > tempest >> mega >>> rokh. in fact, many ctas have instructions specifically prohibiting the use of the rokh. because there is a training lag from the time that artillery was boosted to the time people are trained to use them, you don't see them in fleets as much as fcs would like to see them, but they are rapidly increasing. if you look at fleet compositions from a year ago, the tempest was loathed more than the rokh. i remember people complaining that they were told to get into ceptors and scimis instead of bringing their minmatar bs. the mega is only allowed in fleets because it is the lowest sp alternative to the rokh and half the eve population has trained caldari and/or gallente bs. pilots are told to fly the mega for now, while training for the apoc or tempest.if you look at bc, the brutix and ferox are usually refused in ranged fleets (and both are almost never found in bc fleets).if you look at hacs, the eagle is allowed in fleets, but there is usually a lot of pressure to fly something else. gallente hacs are simply refused in ranged fleets.if you are in an alliance, check your killboard to see the validity of this statement. if you are in an alliance, check the ships requested for the cta. if you aren't in fleet warfare, this topic really won't have much bearing on your game (unless you are using rails for some inexplicable reason)."

3/30/2010,no but not that simple.maby ccp could implement a way to mark your corp as a non combat corp. so other players cannot wardec or shoot you unpunished. but then again your corp should be prohibited to participate in any combat situations. and denied acces to 0.0. or some other nifty way ccp can think of. most of the times industrial corps get wardect for the fun of it and because they can. playing eve should remain fun for every player. and wardeccing a corp just for the fun of it is grieffing.

3/30/2010,"so i'm sure by now everyone has seen the movie ""galaxy quest"" featuring tim allen & sigourney weaver. the most fanstastic part of that movie is when they are piloting their ship through a field of magnetically charged mines begin battering into the ship, unelss they are skillfully navigated. i thought to myself, ""why is there not mines in space in eve?"" picture a mine field placed by a faction as protection, or left over from a previous war, that choose no sides, set up in a formation where the correct angle will allow you to navigate through, or require you to be at a certain constant velocity (magnetic). picture it like a cloud in the distance that might just make a mess if your too close, or might be faster to navigate through if your a half decent pilot.the purchasing of a mine field should be set up so your not choosing one at a time, but you can buy packages of 1,000 to 1,000,000 or more at a time (priced accordingly). concord shouldn't allow mine field placement anywhere near stargates or starbases, but rather in 0.0 spaces, low level security spaces, and areas distant from common traffic . . . .or right on areas with traffic. more or less a mercenary or pirating tool.battlecruisers or larger would be the only ships capable of setting up a mine field with a tractor beam like tool that pulls multiple mines from the cargo hold and places them in their strategic location where they await activation by the ships pilot in an easy ""set it and forget it"" way when the mines have been placed. obviously the ship would need to be at a decent distance from the mines before activation . . . or it just wouldnt be too pretty. once the mines are set, passer-by's will see the formation as a named field, not as individual mines, preventing your overview from having millions of items. mines will only show up on your radar individually if you are within its magnetic range, making the purchace of magnetic mines more efficient. regular mines are placed in a closer formation since they only activate when hit. pro's - - new skills to train- garunteed sales (they are mines!)- better protection from attack during wartime or from other assault- the possibility of a sport being created (mine winding - the piloting of a ship through a minefield to attain the fastest start to finish time. i know i would watch in hopes of seeing some major explosions)- they cannot be destroyed unless you are at a certain ""too close for comfort range""- would require target ships to take their chances, or take a while longer to go around- only certain ships with mine field destruction weapons could take them out (like a doomsday bomb, or something of the sort)- new added feature for missions. . . the list could go on forevercon's- require a lot of setup time for large number fields (unless multiple ships work together)- concord has the ability to erradicate a minefield, or deactivate them at any time- an emp emitter attached to a ship can prevent the mines from detonating, however, the emitter would require most of the power from your ship.- requires a specially fitted ship to assemble a mine field- can only be set up in certain areas- destroyers should posess the highest advantage against mine fields due to speed, and their ability to target mines farther than other ships (the ships name says it all)- increased risk of loosing ship- could potentially be set up in a location that could interfere with miners ;-)- pvp can become much harder but much more interesting- corps can be extremely well protected against enemy attacks. . . the list could continue alsooverall the idea is immense in design, but could create a new level of gaming that requires better piloting skill, allows sport, and introduces something never added to a game before; space mine fields"
3/30/2010,"i am all for this. it has been brought up many times and been shot down due to issues involving lag. but why not make it like some sort of area affect damage, like damaging clouds? it would just do area of effect damage to all ships within it's perimeter until the mines run out. then you could put up another field, or add mines to an existing one. makes sense to me :)"
3/30/2010,"additional ideas & elaboration:minefields being set up in a star map like probing, but on a smaller scale. maybe even grouping them in bunches so one block of 5 mines (4 on the corners, one in the middle) consists of one ""item."" ecm modules have the capability to deflect mine attacks depending on the magnetromic strength, but tier 2 mines may require a higher magnetromic strenth to disrupt tracking. when carried onboard, your ships damage resistance is decreased.requires a module specific for setting up mines, which would require high skill amounts in electronics, achoring, etc. can be destroyed by smartbombs if mines are not invulnerable***could be left in space indefinitly as long as they are not activated, or destroyed by concord. certain missions such as 'race through the poisonous cloud' can become 'race through the minefields' and can appear in level 3 - 4 - or 5 missions. can make it harder to kill drone infestations***targeting range: 10k - giving aggression for targeted player on deployer (deployer does not have aggression unless attacked by targeted player). activation range: 8k - speed: 350m/sthermal damage: 300 hp (very undecided obviously)idea: allows for warpout with mines following for up to 9au (bubble trapped mines)you can get aggression on the deployer before the mines are even activated on you. ore-guard mines - protect mining operations (as fleets are safeguarded also) and containers. targeting range: 14kactive range: 10k only able to be fitted to mining barges with a lower powered module than the combat mine module which will take up a lot of power & cpu. can only be activated if the player mining who deployed them has aggression on the ""can-flipper"" for example, similar to drones. counter-measure mines: will disrupt missles or bombs mid-flight within range, take the targeting for that missile & destroy it along with the mine itself. will disrupt to destroy any missile or bomb (friendly or foe). effective but mostly useful for evasive maneuvers. war mines: targeting range: 6kactive range: 5kdamage: 100hp (very undecided)speed: 500m/sused in larger masses to cover areas, power in numbers, but not as devastating as combat mines. smaller capacity, but much less damage. up-close and personal weaponry to help put enemies off their course. whatif at the time of placement, they must be within a specific signature area, like 1au out from a stargate only, or only, to support your idea, be allowed to be placed with a mine-pod module (much like the expanded probe bay only much larger to fit)?having large mines in your cargohold in high security sectors will be red flagged immediatly by customs, and result in the destroying of vessel. small mines, with the explosive capabilites of smaller missles, will be able to be deployed in high sector, but since there is, as you say ""friend or foe"" result in the mines (which are linked to your targeting also) instantly targeting any ship for aggresion, leaving you at the mercy of concord. sice pods have such a low signature, they are never detected by mines. only your ship gives off a ""low frequency"" that the probes read from your module that classify you, or fleeted, as a friendly. all others are considered hostile, and treated thereas.there is so much i want to bring back into mines as a whole, but they cannot just be a messy nuiscance that causes economic problems for miners, which i should not have stated in my proposal theory, as they should only be critical in 0.0, and minimal in higher security areas. the fact that mines have auto-targeting, an enemy targeted by a mine has aggression on the deployer & fleet (since they are invulnerable also, they should be treated equally.)a vessel that has laid mines, and docks, will loose ownership of the mines (whether undocked again with module or not) and be treated as hostile. though control ownership will be lost, aggression will still be given to the deployer in any circumstances. help me get more ideas, i know some of you are amazing thinkers."

3/30/2010,at first i thought this was a thread based on the very very useful skill que. (which has saved my ass given my busy schedule.) now that i've read it i'll put my own support behind it as it would decrease the time required to warp out if you stop once aligned :)
3/30/2010,"the idea of passive alignment is redundant. pointing your ship in the direction of your intended warping point and having your speed set at 0.0 will take you the same amount of time to initiate a warp as it would if your ship were pointed in the opposite direction. the only thing passive alignment is good for is for fc's to get a rough idea of how many people are still awake and ready in the fleet. even then it mostly doesn't matterthe only thing this would affect is bombers and for that i give my support. the ctr- and ctr+ works, but it just seems like a needless hassle. if anything, they should just add a button that levels your ship for the ocd among us."
3/30/2010,"agree!re-post from my thread:so:ships should allign only on demand, and be possible to remain aligned even with 0 m/s speed. and why else is it usefull - when waiting for somebody to appear from behind the gate - it's essential to face the direction where target probably will appear, so you don't waste time to turn - otherwise it's more likely to escape. and this is not about warping, but about where your ship's front is facing to. <-- added this because some people complained about warping issues, which i am not talking about here. just facing!"
3/30/2010,"i will repeat, passive alignment does not help you. if you are sitting at 0m/s facing in the opposite direction of your intended path, your ship having to turn around has no bearing on how long it takes to get to a certain speed. your ship will turn around and be at it's full speed in exactly the same amount of time as if the ship were pointed directly at your target."

3/30/2010,"i would like to propose the idea of storable waypoints. when you have added multiple waypoints to the autopilot, you can press a button and save the route under a name and description. this will save the individual waypoints, the order of the waypoints and the settings used at the time you saved the route (use systems in low sec only, use systems in high sec only or use the fastest route).when you want to load a stored route you can simply choose one of a list of previously saved routes. by this means you get exact the same route again and don't have to arrange the waypoints and set the settings again.the system you are currently in will be added as waypoint before the first waypoint of the saved route. if you want to optimize the route with the current system you can use the already existing button for optimization or manually arrange the waypoints.i know that you could save the waypoints in notepad and load them fron there. but if you have a lots of waypoints it is very nerving to load them via the menu and set the correct security-setting again every time you fly this route.and now: open for discussion :)"

3/31/2010,"welcome to the foldwhatever you do remember this: occam's razor.i am leaning myself towards an ammo fix, but that would bunch up the panties of the blaster guys, so i decided to keep away from it and propose the generic damage increase proposal (the 15% is solidly justified and a very good compromise overall). my ideal solution would be for railguns to receive the 15% damage boost as an increase to the kinetic damage they deliver, while the blasters get their damage boost in thermal/em type."
3/31/2010,"pretty much exactly what i proposed in the original s&m topic. except do not change the damage type of blasters. leave it as thermal/kinetic.honestly, a huge step in the right direction of fixing blasters/railguns lies in their high damage ammo, void & javelin.void: increase the damage to stand out over faction antimatter, and remove the tracking penalty.javelin: increase range, remove the horrendous speed nerf/tracking penalty.downsides are: void largely replaces null. rest of the eve players complain that hybrid pilots actually have usable t2 ammo :p"

3/31/2010,"these missions are indeed ill conceived.someone earlier in the thread asked about the mission and how they relate to fw mission goals, not read all the pages so not sure if this has been answered, but here is my experience.... i needed to kill a load of elite frigs/cruisers in 0.2 space fw territory. the mission description said that the transports needed to be killed. the mission did not spawn the targets until i had killed a ridiculous number of elite faction ships. this level 2 mission would have been difficult/impossible to complete in a sb because of the extreme blobbing of the npcs. a sb would have been decloaked long before reaching the target and would then have to tank the 40+ strong blob even if the transports that were present in the initial spawn were the mission completion triggers.in my opinion, this level 2 mission is approximately as hard as a level 3.5 mission. no bss, but many elite frigs and cruisers all in one blob.i shed no carebear tears, i completed the mission (in 5 hours , in the same lowsec system). i just think that balancing needs to be done extensively on these missions. they are well out of the capabilities of many combat pilots running at the level of the mission. apart from that, they are being given to miners/industrialists. i didn't have the option of getting help from corp mates because the target system was over 20 (5 through lowsec) jumps away for a 40 jump round trip.i don't mind going into lowsec for a larger than usual faction gain from a combat mission. most storyline missions are a joke (more combat storylines please ), but taking a faction hit for the opposing faction coupled with the ridiculous journey time, mission difficulty, low isk reward, lowsec location of encounter, these missions need restarting from scratch by the dev team.edit:i feel that my post needs to be more constructive. some suggestions...1. less jumps to destination! 20 jumps for a low volume level 4 courier storyline is fair enough for the standings gain, but not for a combat mission.2. better/more accurate description of the mission objective.3. pirate faction npcs. if people are running missions for standings they are most likely primarily operating in empire and do not want to take massive standings hits for any faction. fw is there for people who don't care about opposing faction standings.4. achievable objectives in a reasonable amount of time. this is lowsec pirate/fw territory. close to 100 ships, many elite, does not make for reasonable mission completion times in a pvp fitted ship.5. a choice of mission types. low reward/low risk (courier/supply) storylines for industrialists/carebears, high reward/high risk lowsec combat missions for combat pilots. the mission choice mechanic is already in game in the epic arcs so should not be too difficult to use on a storyline mission. this would be the carrot rather than the stick approach and after taking a load of the carebear options, carebears might just get a little brave and head to lowsec on their own."
3/31/2010,"pve and pvp are two different playstyles! you cannot force one upon the other!it will not work! period! people rather quit, than being forced into something they do not want!somehow ccp just don't want to get that simple fact! it's like they have a huge big plate in front of their heads and refuse to accept this. /facepalm jer"
3/31/2010,i support the idea that the storylines be removed.
3/31/2010,so what is your proposed solution for both parties?
3/31/2010,after looking at the rewards to risks they just don't seem good enough to actually go and do them. if something was changed then it'd be a great idea but as of now they are just not worth it.
3/31/2010,simple. choice.seperate low sec missions from high sec missions and let people chose to go for the more risky ones by their own choice.not like they do now by trying to sneak low sec missions into high sec missions/storylines and so basically forcing people into it.if the low sec missions have a good risk vs. reward. then there will be plenty of people trying them out by their own choice.jer
3/31/2010,"correct me if i am mistaken but im fairly sure you have the ""choice"" to decline these missions. you might not get that standing boost you are so accustomed to being handed on a plate but isn't that part of ""good risk vs. reward.""?how do you imagine pvpers feel about the game ""forcing"" them into doing something they probably loathe (pve) to be competitive? is doing stuff we dislike from time to time not an integral part of a game like this?"

3/31/2010,"i was in the fleets rolling wi. out of geminate right after the expansion. early on, there was a constant threat of counter attack. if nodes wouldn't have completely lagged out nearly every time a fleet jumped/warped, that war would have had a lot more action than it did. because the threat of lag was increasingly more feared than enemy fleets, fleets had to be split up more than they traditionally had been. this means cap fleets often do not have their support fleet near them for protection. this means things like this are a big worry in the current sov warfare system. it moved a cap fleet without support because support + caps often means people get stuck. grids don't handle anywhere near as many people as they used to. nc seems to have forgotten their experience in geminate and elsewhere, and tried to load too many ships into the fight at the same time. so, even before the node died, many in the nc fleet were not involved in the fight, so far fewer ships were lost by it than would have been lost if the nc fleet managed the entry of ships better.so, the point of that story is attacking a system with 12 stations would require a very large, very split up fleet. a fleet with a game mechanics weakness that will be exploited (unless fixed), making it impossible to take out a system. when fixed, it will only be a matter of re-flipping stations back with a handful of bombers or repping stations. without a really large fleet, you won't be able to roll a system with a lot of stations."
3/31/2010,you still haven't explained why this would be more challenging than taking the same 12 stations in 12 different systems supported by 12 ihubs.
3/31/2010,"because you can flip a station in one system right before downtime. when the servers come back up - presto-chango - it is fully repped, requiring a fleet to flip it back (rather than just a few stealth bombers). for this reason, station attacks are timed so the station will be flipped within minutes of downtime. even if you managed to magically flip each station in a system with 1 siege cycle each and no time between, 12 stations would take 2 hours. that's plenty of time for the defender to sneak in and flip some of them back. thus beginning a never ending flip back and forth of stations. a.k.a. static sovereignty. this would be rolling back the sov changes made in dominion to the pos wars of old, but worse. with this mechanic, neither side would have to haul in and setup new resistars as stations don't die. so, if taking sov before was bad, taking it with multiple stations allowed per system would be impossible."
3/31/2010,"i support this idea, but the idea should come with a thorough analysis of the sov system and not just it takes x amount of time to conquer the system with x number of stations. if an unlimited number of outposts are allowed maybe how outposts function needs to be reviewed, systems like destructable, operating costs, and total hp, so that while you can support a dozen outposts in a system maybe it becomes increasingly less cost effective to have a large number of outposts."
3/31/2010,"... and then what? stations can't be destroyed. if it costs too much to run all the stations, what does the alliance do? if they can remove/add stations at will, it is the old ""drop towers on all moons"" pos slog but worse. most of the big alliances can easily hold a collection of strategic station eggs to make systems invincible in the face of attack.if you want more stations in systems, then sov can't be tied to the stations at all."
3/31/2010,"agreed, like i and most everyone else has said for this to work sov needs to looked at. i was proposing a way to discourage the have an unlimited number of stations. you do bring up an interesting idea of unanchoring an outpost like we do with pos. i feel that this would substantially lessen the value of an attack on a system with an outpost if the defenders can just take it and run. could easily come up with a back story that prevents the unanchoring of an outpost, but still have a destructible capability.also, what if we took the approach and removed the station-sov connection entirely. you don't need sov to own a station maybe even to build a station (would obviously need to rework how stations are built then or let sov charge for planet anchoring or whatever). in empire there are caldari corporation stations in gallente space and such why shouldn't a similar thing be possible in 0.0?"
3/31/2010,"i believe station ownership/rights are connected to sov, and have been since the dawn of time. so, asking ccp to change that would (probably) be a major undertaking and met with similar ""oh god, oh god, run and hide"" response as to the repeated beating the dead horse threads.if stations are disconnected from sov (not in the op proposal), i would support this proposal to a degree. however, i don't think ccp would even blink before saying ""no"" if csm proposed it."
3/31/2010,"afaik, the only connection to sov an outpost has is that you have to have sov to deploy one. since sov is an alliance level option, and outposts are corp level structures i see no reason why there should be a arbitrary hard limit on the number of stations aloud to be deployed in a system. on the other hand is should be limited in some way. i would suggest any additional stations in a system have certain limitations, or expenditures associated with them. monthly fees should be added to additional outposts so you have to decide if the benefit is worth the cost. it's not so hard to come up with he isk and materials to build a spare outpost in a system, but if it's going to incur a recurring cost that stacks with even more additional outposts then you now have some choices to make. edit: if the fees cannot be payed, or there is no controller of the outpost then start it on a decay timer and start letting rats use it as a base of operation, sorta like a dynamic mission based on lack of payment. adds some atmosphere to the loss of an outpost. if it's left long enough, and it's decay timer runs out (very long timer) then blow it up. if the argument is that every new outpost has the potential of stressing the database with all new market information because they all have markets, simply force one of the outposts (first one obviously) to be labeled as the primary outpost and be the only one with market services.as far as overpopulation of 0.0 with outposts is concerned; at some point in the future there will be an outpost in every claimable system. then those that wish to build their own are screwed. if you think this is impossible, open your map in-game and sort the star colors by services and select insurance as the filter. there are already a lot of outposts in 0.0, and there will only be more in the future.-zoltar"
3/31/2010,"a corp not in the alliance holding sov in a system cannot control the system's station. flipping a station is one of the ways to flip sov in the dominion sov mechanics.agreed. however, ccp said a while back that stations/outposts cannot be destroyed without a massive overhaul of the code. at some point, this should happen. when that happens, sov should also be disconnected from station ownership. when those two things happen, then multiple stations per system wouldn't be a problem."
3/31/2010,i think this is a great idea. seems silly to have a limit of one.though i think there's a reasonable upper limit to have...say 5? 10?
3/31/2010,"yes i know outposts cannot be destroyed at-current, that would have to be changed to impliment the other crap in y post. ;-) although, i gotta ask, if a corp owns an outpost, and is kicked from an alliance, they no longer have sov, and are no longer in the alliance, but they still own the outpost right? if it is impossible for a corp to own an outpost while not in an alliance then they would have to hand over the outpost before the alliance could kick them, but i assume that things of that nature happen between people on good terms, not between people that are mad enough to give someone the boot. just wondering how that works right now, i've never encountered it so i don't know.-zoltaredited for support."
3/31/2010,"well logical limiter is number of planets you can deploy the station at. i'm not especially keen ofc about the limit of having to install it at the planet ofc either (as long as you can't install it in the same grid as pos) it's not like you can hide a station as it shines in the overview. as far as current sov warfare goes ofc it sucks and so does lag, but basing development decisions on lag is not that good idea either. anyway - several ways to circumenvent the 'omg many station to shoot thru' issue (if it is issue) have been already posted. for example having to point one station in the system as capital or master station and if this flips then so do others in the system. so in my eyes the condition of current sov warfare is not a reason to keep that limit in place as it's easy to adress the concenrs related to many station in one system if so desired. i also do not see immediate danger of 0.0 getting filled with stations, as if this would be the issue it would be already happening. eventually yes - there will be 1 station in every starsystem in 0.0 under current mehanics as ccp made sure of it when the sov was tied to station in the way it was done. after there is already a station in the system is that so big step upwards if there is several in the system ?"
3/31/2010,"people in this thread really should try to engage their brains and think before randomly spamming ""no lol"" because in your mind mines can only work in a single negative way. if brought back mines would be balanced and contribute an interesting gameplay option. devs have long said they would like to revisit mines. signed."
3/31/2010,fixed a bit fixed again
3/31/2010,"thanks for the attempt to help out, but my original post was closer to what i meant. keep posting though, your contributions are helpful and original."

3/31/2010,"now that it has been announced that insurance, drone regions, and loot is taking a nerf. data should definately be supplied to be contrasted to another study done before winter expansion so players can see the difference in the mineral supply."

3/31/2010,this almost implies that they have one to start with.
3/31/2010,"communicaiton scramblerthis fits in a high slot of assault ships. no other ship can fit it. the assault ship will use this against a locked target and disrupts his communication which includes:- all broadcast, both outgoing and incoming are scrambled. thus any broadcast such as ""need armor"" will fall on deaf ears. in space, no one can hear you scream.- all communication with stations. without being able to communicate with the station, the target can not get approval to dock. scotty will not open a docking bay for you because the sounds of donuts being vanquished easily drown out your tears for playing station games.- because this module requires all of the ships electronical interfacing, no other electronic warfare module can be fitted in fear of throwing off the balance of the computer mumbo jumbo.along with this module, a new station button will be introduced that would act similar to a directional scanner in the since that it will show what is on grid to the station and how far out. who is piloting these ship would not be shown.with the indroduction of both the communication scrambler and the in station short range scanner (a window), the assault ship becomes a very valuable ship to have in any fleet working both around stations and off station disrupting logistics and causing general havoc.i know, not original, but is based of ccp/csm/eve community feedback. i hope you enjoy. if you feel some things need to be tweaked, please give feedback with comments.- marconus orion"

3/31/2010,is the idea not interesting for anyone?
3/31/2010,"i can't speak for everyone, but i'm having trouble understanding the need for this. is this so you can go to different market hubs and pick up your purchases without having to change the autopilot or what? i would think a macro (against the rules) can accomplish this already, so it isn't for macro mining/missioning. an fc usually doesn't run the exact same route for roams, adjusted to hit hot spots as they are identified. so, i guess i'm just having trouble understanding the need. what is the purpose?"
3/31/2010,"realistically this is just a usability feature. if you are at point a, and you want to get to point e and you set specific points b,c, and d, and you know you are going to make the same trip daily it couldn't hurt to be able to save the path instead of having to enter it manually every time./signed"
3/31/2010,"just bought the book and started studying it. looked over the moros description and.... wtf?!ok, i know i'm late. i went googling the second i saw it. my question is simply: is there any thread that has ccp either explaining why they stealth-nerfed it or apologizing for not putting the nerf in patch notes?i thought the ""only get drone bonus in siege mode"" was weak. does this ""20% instead of 50%/level"" nerf replace that, or has it been double (stealth)-nerfed?i think ccp should have left it alone."
3/31/2010,"the moros used to be able to do more drone damage with 5 heavy drones than a carrier could do with 10 fighters. that has been fixed. there were threadnoughts and it was discussed in a dev blog. if you missed all of this, not sure what to tell you other than ""your dread remains the only dread that is silly powerful against smaller ships"" if you are not satisfied, meh! even post-nerf, the moros is still preferred over the other dreads. it could be worse, you could've been flying the split-fit nag for years.p.s. countdown to thread lock as this is not a post for assembly."
3/31/2010,link?
3/31/2010,"yeah, that dev blog has the first proposed nerf, not the one that actually happened. thanks anyway."
3/31/2010,"since the hic can catch anything i think its about time the warp core stab nerf was removed. i could fit 2 x warp core stabs to avoid getting caught my say an interceptor but i can get killed during warp by a smartbomb (off topic but slightly relevant. the warp core stab can be easily countered by focused warp disruption on a hic, i often run an onyx in empire wars for catching anything stabbed to the eyeballs. for a stab with the nerf that it already has to only have one positive warp point as opposed to the faction scramblers which have 3 x negative points. feels like theyre nerfed enough as it is, nevermind the targeting nerf.i admit, i've never used one in my life, though i would like to see them have some real use, i imagine it would open low sec a little more for some people."
3/31/2010,i do not support this. the point of warp stabilizers is that you want to avoid combat so the nerf on it just keeps it within purpose.
3/31/2010,the warp core stab can be easily countered. far too easily... all you need is a shadow serp scrambler and you have +3 warp points on them making them need at a minimum of 2 warp core stabilisers. a heavy interdictor can point anything whether it is stabbed or not it doesn't bother the dictor. ^ 2 stupidly easily counters to a stupidly overly nerfed module. stupid i know...due to such easy countering i think it is only fair to at least reduce the nerf or remove it. possibly change it for something to do with speed... with some excuse about stress on your propulsion systems.
3/31/2010,"lol easily? all you have to do is put a 120m-150m isk warp scrambler that functions at a range of 13km on your fast tackle that is likely to die. sounds like a smart and easy fit to me!i've seen these on stupidly expensive ships. but, these stupidly expensive ships are not anything remotely close to common pvp ships.more common is having both a scram and a disruptor (for a total of 3 points) on a tackler. however, if this is your fear, you are better off fitting a scram yourself to turn off their mwd so your drones can tear him apart in .5 seconds.anyway, what's to stop you from putting 3 stabs on your ship if you are actually worried about having 3 points on you.this is not wow, you are not supposed to have a pvp on/off switch. welcome to eve."
3/31/2010,"the nerf was imposed to reduce the massive number of near-invincible snipers on entry/choke gates in low-sec. if you remove the targeting penalty, they will return, i'll be one of them, and i'll enjoy saying, ""told you so."" when you come back here and cry about all the snipers your proposed un-nerf caused, and how you can't even get through low-sec gates anymore.heavy interdictors, if fit to survive sentry guns aren't exactly fast. they've got a relatively slow lock-time as well. it's a lot easier to get away from a hic than some people seem to think. the ones that are fit with mwd's are still not fast enough to catch a sniper that's 100+km off a gate before he warps out unless you land on top of him. using faction mods to circumvent warp stabs is not a viable argument to propose changing the stab. few people use the 3-point scrams unless they know they are going to need it.the irritation of having to wait longer to lock targets in missions because you are afraid to get shot is not a viable reason to change wcs back to their previous mechanic. you are fitting them so you do not have to fight a player that scans you down to kill you. there are a multitude of methods to avoid being killed in a mission, a few of those being; keep your scanner open, check to probes in space, don't sit on the mission warp in point, mission with friends, and so on. i am against any change to the wcs as they are now. they perform their function. they do not break anything else. no change needed.-zoltar"
3/31/2010,"oh yeh... forgot people don't invest such isk into t3 ships, pirate faction ships do they so investing into a high warp point, point never happens. what makes a tackler likely to die? i thought you may of noticed a lot of ships fit tackles. a good drake fit should always have a point... oh and it usually fits a stupidly high buffer. would you consider that ""easily killed"". anyway with the fact that the wcs are there to avoid combat why would you fit a scrambler to yourself and use drones... don't think too many industrial ships fit them do you?back to my original point a hic can easily catch any ship no matter how many stabs, thus making a stab easily irrelevant, useless modules and a heavily nerfed ship which has been caught with ease. you talk about ""so your drones can tear him apart in .5 seconds"" back to avoiding combat means you now have to initiate combat? you are also completely assuming the tackler is an interceptor...thanks for pointing that out to me, i must of mixed up the eveonline header with blizzard entertainment... silly me.finally...i hope you understand how easy it is to catch something using a hic... infact... i hope you fly one as a hic pilot myself i understand the concept of being sb'd and pressing f1 to infinitely point something rather easy, if that is too hard to understand please don't come back.i will now use your own phrase to explain this we have fitting limitations. edit: to zoltar tarzoid... i can't tell if i've spelt that correctly sorry,fitting wcs to a sniper ship before the nerf was considered good, however think of the stupid low dps you receive now, i wasn't around when this nerf was initially instigated however was a dramiel/daredevil? on sisi last night i broke the 10km/s barrier in a dramiel for the first time myself, i managed to fly from ffa1 0m to a sniper battleship at 170km before he managed to get away i had him pointed and a random friend warped on top of him to finish him. this is assuming most snipers are battleships and slow align times as well as lack of concentration = being tackled. wcs are easily countered as we said before if you are sitting in a mael, you will have 5 low slots, you will need damage or tracking mods in the low to be of any use as a sniper, a minimum of 3 say would leave you with 2 low slots thus making a scrambler and a warp disruptor have you pointed and unable to warp. eve has changed a lot and i think its time the wcss were changed too.however the point you raised on the sniper ships was extremely valid and still is a huge cause for concern for this proposal to be taken seriously."
3/31/2010,"if you are being 3-point tackled by drakes and then dying... perhaps you should blame yourself or your own fit. alternately, you can play in space that is safe, like high sec, or join a corp/alliance and help to keep a section of space safe for the benefit of yourself and your corp/alliance mates.wcs is supposed to be primarily for travel fit ships, not so someone can rat/mission in low/null sec and be immune to pvp.so, you're getting locked by a hic, then it is able to get into range, and put an infinite point on you? see above comment about blame on fit/self. pretty sure i've flown hics, dictors, and ceptors more than you, so find someone else to lecture.pay attention to local, don't sit at 0 from the warpin, stay aligned out... i mean some really basic concepts in eve.my point is that wcss are not supposed to be an idiot button to avoid combat, as can be found in more simple games like wow. this is a higher functioning game, you are supposed to use more tactics than ""press button"" to win. turn your brain back on."
3/31/2010,"if you weren't an eve player when this nerf was implemented, then how do you know it was considered good to have a stab on a sniper ship, furthermore how can you possibly understand why that was the case even if it were? also, just for reference, yes, the faction frigs were around then, and they were faster. it wasn't at all uncommon for a standard t2 interceptor to hit 15-16km/s. and it wasn't unheard of for a crow pilot to spend a billion isk on dead space mods to get their ship up to 24-26km/s the sniper you caught was on sisi, where the loss of his ship isn't important the slightest. had the situation been replayed on tq, you can bet he'd have been aligned to something and ready to warp out the instant he realized you were coming at him.the reason snipers fit stabs pre-nerf is because there was zero penalty attached to them. they could fill their lows with stabs and nothing at the time could stop them from getting away short of 4-5 tacklers sporting 2-point scrams. once again, assuming they weren't paying attention, and weren't pre-aligned. lack of attention is not something to base balance changes on. a heavy interdictor's infini-point has a maximum range, the sniper is well outside of that range, therefore you still have to get a warp-in on the sniper, this requires some effort, and generally more than 1 person. if the siper is anywhere near worth his salt, he won't let this happen. there is no need for a sniper who's paying attention, and doesn't use only 1 snipe-point to use a wcs as a crutch. i still say there is no need to change it back.-zoltar@ bagehi regarding his post after this one -- exactly."
3/31/2010,"this is what happens when people can fit stabs without penalties.you can't see the fits properly, but (if memory serves me) he would put 4 mags and 3 stabs on that thing and rip people apart from 200+km with that thing. then send an alt in after an hour or so to scoop the dozens of wrecks left behind.he was not the only one like this. stabs were nerfed because of this. if you think this is bad, imagine the alpha of a sniper maelstrom that cannot be tackled and what that would do to low sec choke points."
3/31/2010,"yes but silo's are large collidables and so are structures and sometimes they do drop items like scrapmetal or ammo. why couldnt they do the same. it would seed the local ecomony with named items since as i understand it, npc stations will soon will not be selling them soon."
3/31/2010,"huh? i think you think you understand. it doesn't sound like you do. they are decreasing the module drops from mission running and ratting because it has too much impact on the mineral market. what you are suggesting is increasing the module drop. this is similar to requests to be able to unanchor towers in missions which is also absurd. the devs could make a bunch of junk npc ships/structures that aren't like anything player owned in the game to cut down on requests like the op. unfortunately, there would be even more requests, like the ludicrous request that pops up from time to time for player owned concord ships, if they did."
3/31/2010,i really really wish there is no downtime.or at least move the downtime to an other time.or downtime only 2x /week.is it really necessary to have downtime every day at the same time ?
