1/1/2016,"i have some questions, please: can the current csm please explain why they feel, there should be a csm xi ?not to take away from work that csm members have done, but there are members of the community out there, that feel, that the csm doesn't represent their views adequately to ccp & would like to know, what's the point in keeping the csm in its current form? even some csm members acknowledge the csm's current structure & levels of interaction with ccp need to change inorder for it to be relevant. with ccp using focus groups to get better feed back and advice from the community on upcoming changes than what the csm can provide, why is keeping the csm a good idea and if it is to continue, what will be done to stop the rot / turnover of elected members being removed, because they either decided to go afk from the game, not live up to the promises they made to be elected or leaked information that they shouldn't of ?.i'm not meaning to rain on anyone's parade, but i would like to know, why and how would a csm xi will be relevant in 2016 and what will allow it to reconnect overall with a player base that doesn't think the csm has any value to them & better serve our community?i believe these things should be answered before we get into a bunch of campaigns by people, for something that most people don't care about or show interest in, until the lead up to fanfest."

1/1/2016,what's your take on passive income sources such as moon mining?
1/1/2016,"moon mining isn't exactly passive. there can be a bunch of work shifting stuff around to create value. and they should require defence. the should is the key word there, because you end up with diplomats working out agreements not to attack each others moons and so on. grrr, diplomats. ruining people's fun.i'd prefer to see moon mining moved to a somewhat more active process, allowing for disruption, even if that's not taken to the point of destroying the thing doing it. so being able to raid and get some of the output (more active than a siphon)"
1/1/2016,"if you don't vote for anyone else, if you don't even usually vote at all, vote for steven ronuken. he has brought a wealth of technical knowledge tot he csm, and he's been consistently valuable to the players and to ccp. he's stayed out of the drama, and he's one of the few csm members i've never seen anyone say a bad word about (apart from when i told him off for not getting elected the first time he ran, dambit steve)whatever you may think about the csm in general, getting steve another year on the csm benefits everybody."

1/2/2016,i've flown with joffy on and off over the last 2 years. he's a great guy and his knowledge of the game is outstanding. he'll be a great asset to the next csm and will be getting my vote!
1/2/2016,"i've known joffy for couple months and he's a really great guy and great (mainly lowsec) pvper.he's got very strong advantage over other lowsec oriented candidates - he's independent and not part of any large power bloc.this means his perspective on improving things will cover everyone's gameplay, not only the ones in the interest of his own alliance/power bloc.vote for joffy, as this can really improve eve for everyone!"

1/2/2016,"what new information do you expect to give to ccp in your third term? you have already had a couple years to share with ccp. what value add do you continue to have for the csm as opposed to some random new person who might have novel opinions to share with ccp?i.e. what fresh ideas are you bringing to the table, or is ccp so hard of hearing that you need to keep saying the same things you said for the last few years?"

1/2/2016,you have my number 1 vote as always
1/2/2016,see you are making a basic assumption that we 'bring things' to ccp. we do now and again but steve has excelled at being cooperative with ccp api/crest and the technical sides of eve. he also is great at anaysis of industrial changes but he is in constant communication with the devs few of you even know of.he is not 'done' and i doubt he ever could be. losing him would be a real blow to the csm/ccp dynamic.vote for steve.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>
1/2/2016,"that's a hard one to answer, really.i mean, for example, i put up a wishlist of things i wanted for a launcher replacement, several months before we heard about ccp working on the launcher which has just gone live. can i claim credit for that? nearly everything on the wishlist got hit, after all.or an ice mining frigate. i asked for it, but i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one.i'm asking for rorq changes, and we're getting some (some public, some not yet) can i claim those?last term, i suggested tying the vulnerability window to the adm (it's in the minutes). but i wasn't the only person to do so.can i claim crest? i mean, they were working on it, but i've been constantly asking about it, asking for small changes, asking for new features and so on.you see where i'm going with this? it's not an easy thing to quantify."
1/2/2016,"yes.old content should be revisited, and revamped every so often, as technology becomes available to do so. like reworking missions to use the new ai, and be more procedurally generated. for example."
1/2/2016,.
1/2/2016,hello!i will chuck a few questions your way if you don't mind?1) what impact do you see citadels having on fw if any?2) if you were ccp what new ship class concept would you work on next (its role/class) and why?3) what are your thoughts on a four way faction war and how would you envision it working in practice?4) traditionally fw's interests get represented by a low sec pirate candidate partly because few fw candidates can gather support outside of their own militia. how are you going to campaign to break this trend and gather fw pilots outside of amarr militia (or ex amarr militia) vote? what qualities do you have as an individual that would overcome the normal reluctance to put a rival militia officer in front of the developers influencing low secs mechanics?good luck out there.
1/2/2016,great guy with lots of experience+1
1/2/2016,i support this product!for real though this is a good dude that has a good grasp on what is going on in eve at the present moment. i have known him for a long while now and would definitely recommend him for the job. his knack for questioning the status quo in almost everything eve related has been a welcomed breath of fresh air since he joined my corp and i think he could do the same things to the csm. good luck!
1/2/2016,kelmac is a great dude!good luck m8
1/2/2016,"pax amarr.i address all of new eden. first and foremost my brothers in the 24th imperial crusade, then friends and loyalists of amarr, our caldari acquaintances of utility, and finally the dirty vile heathens that roam low sec and beyond.having failed miserably at the amarr succession trials with my dirt n glitter brothers (including nikolai agnon - also running for csm xi - please support him if you don't think my campaign is super awesome) - i have now turned my attention to politics.the campaign platform is simple, and a little different to the policies and proposals of other candidates. different is not always bad. the basic outline is:#1 information is everything - better real time analytics for improved in game decision making#2 ecm - make it more interesting, less binary.#3 social integration - in game should be as connected to eve community as out of game.#4 roleplay - #wizzardhatsmatter - make it truly meaningful for the pve experience.#5 home defense - solo bonuses tied to your high activity systems that degrade with inactivity#6 politics & standings - individual, corp, alliance and fleet level management of political relationships in real time across multiple dimensions fully integrated into overview.the basic driver behind my campaign is to set eve up to be great for the next 10 years, and i believe this is done best by building on the strength of eve as a hard game anyone can play, no one can master and very few restrictions on playstyle. this is best achieved by enhancing the tools both social and analytical players have at their disposal to navigate this ever increasing complexity with ease. and making ecm less boring for everyone.the full text of my policies and campaign announcement are located on my blog thing:"
1/3/2016,"the first few weeks or even months after the first ones arrive in the warzones i expect will be pretty turbulent, as everyone is itching to try them out. after the newness dies down, depending on whether there are restrictions on anchoring, i suspect mediums will be used as forward staging bases similarly to poses, especially as they have at least a full week of action if they survive the anchoring stage. i expect the more powerful entities on each side will put up large citadels in their home systems, giving defenders advantages for their fortresses. it also better allows groups to feasibly live in stationless systems.very little has been announced about the four way war. even the current csm members seem to know little other than that description. if i had to guess at its implementation, it would mean any fw system could be claimable by any militia, in either warzone. due to trade hub and hisec access, each militia would likely stay near to their main empires, though if an amarr group wanted to take a break in calgal, or if galmil wanted to live in heimatar, they could simply pack up, plex up a system, claim it, and live there.my guess on conquest implementation involves a two-phase system capture sequence: as long as one militia holds a system, any other militia's plexing counts offensively. when the system reaches high enough contestation, it'd enter a freeport-like mode, where any interested parties would need to compete for their own militia.this is one of my biggest concerns in running for csm for fw, and why i'm also doubling as a lowsec candidate. a csm's job is more for feedback and precaution for ccp than for direction, and it's naive to expect that all my dreams will come true. by being overly verbose in my ideas on change and rebalance, i hope to convince all the militias that i have everyone's interest in fun at heart, and not just amarr's. i want better pirate presence, as well. cage/dbd/swcw/etc: they're bad guys for us, but i want them to have even more chances to be those bad guys and impact our warzones.this question took me a while, actually! we just finished getting 13 new ships, many of which i'm still excited about. small ships need a little rebalancing (mostly the afs), and destroyers still don't have navy variants, which i find a little odd. that said, command destroyers and t2 logi frigates filled the two biggest gaps in small ship combat, plus we have new ewar frigates. asking for more small ships seems a little overkill atm, especially since most of the roles are already handled pretty well. instead, i decided to look towards larger ships, and possibly a solution to bringing back bs/bc fleets.bses are infrequently used in lowsec these days aside from arty machariels, because cruisers simply outperform them and it's hard to force any engagement except over structures. there's no large-sized form of tackle, and they warp too slowly to catch anything. battlecruisers are a little better in speed and warp time, but they still don't offer tackle solutions. given that their role as command ships was recently added to destroyers, and that the other t2 destroyers are interdictors (speedy tackle in null, and expensive dessies in low), it seems to me the interdictor role could be shared with battlecruisers. in null, cruiser fleets oftentimes wont even undock without dictors. for roaming fleets, battleships are usually skipped as they don't have tackle options, either because they're too slow or because there's no way to feasibly tackle ships except in brawling distance, which favors cruisers and below.to remedy this, and to make bs fleets strong again, i'd suggest a new point interdictor class of support bcs. they would have 3.5 au/s warp speed, t2 resists, and a role bonus of +100% optimal range to wdfgs (can only use the scripted version, and they would prevent gate usage), which would pose valid risks to t3 fleets that can often simply de-aggress on a gate and walk away if they decide they don't want to fight. in practice they would rarely apply much damage, but coupled with other micro-jump mechanics (including the destroyer), they could help battleships see more usage outside of exclusively structure ops.a point interdictor would be more expensive than a hic, with lower scan res and bigger signature radius (especially if it tries using mwd or mmjd). it would have t2 resists, but without the further 20% bonus that hics get for free. it could be strong in gatecamps, but only as support-tackle, as even with sebos, bcs take a while to lock small targets. the two ship classes would overlap a bit, but hics would be preferable or at least equally suitable for most scenarios other than bc and bs fleets.it'd be new and could help bc/bs fleets see a return. in these fleets they'd be preferable over hics and inties, though for capital escalations, hics would still be ideal. i don't personally find battleship fleets all that enjoyable, but it'd be nice if bcs and bses had their own spot in subcap combat again, as right now their engagement options are a bit limited."
1/4/2016,"what is disappointing is the lack of dev responses and comments here. sorry to say but it looks like my eve online subscription will end when there is an mmo that shows me the original promise of eve online, that of a space simulator that has all the things depicted in any sci-fi movie.star citizen is close but isn't a true mmo. its the masive part that is its short coming. so it wont be able to effect historical on a scale like events in gamming as what we have experienced in eve. eve has become stagnant. its imagination has had its breaks put on, were it can only iterate within its core self. this was not its original promise and vision. it has become a game of disappointments rather than the sandbox that has its box opened to other parts of the beach. the sand has become dry and the box claustrophobic. many of the old time players are syndical of remembering the old promise. they only remember the failure of the over reach by ccp. aspiring to have great goals is not a bad thing. each year our computers become more powerful and the tech becomes more capable. unfortunately fear seams to be the overriding influence to pushing forward and giving the players true reasons to continue to play; which is more... space, and places, even if the space is inside of my ship on a planet or in a station. with dust514 and valkyrie there was a promise that those venues would be part of a whole game yet that promise hasn't been fulfilled again.eve was the original promise and even if the technology isn't there to create in one game/platform all the gameplay of the original promise it should be the hub that connects all of them. eve should be profoundly affected by what goes on, on the ground in dust514, and if there are space battles to be won valkyrie pilots should be a force to contend with.i do want to see planets defending there space from hostiles space ships by blowing them out of space from the ground. i do want to hire dust mercs to help me not just blow someone else's ship up but take it from him by boarding it and shooting the pod jockey in the head. i want to have valkyrie pilots at my disposal to help me disable my enemies capital ships so i can land my boarding party and take his stuff. being it his pos, his planet, or his titan.i do want to get off my ship and hunt creatures on planets for sport or for gain. i do want to take a planet over and become its lord. i want to build cities and homes that look out onto alien vistas and see my factories billow smoke as they produce the finest ship that will blow up in glorious space wars.i do want to call my friends and plan our secret meetings to take over the universe. or simply hang out and listen to some music and talk about my new baby girl that was just born, all from my home on a planet or on my capital ship or in my station.i think...this dream, the original dream that sparked this in my imagination is all right with all of you too. lets be encouraging to ccp while we wait. sooner or later this dream will be fulfilled by someone. it would be great if ccp where to do it. it will come and ill see you there."
1/4/2016,"loaded language there. some csm members believe. not the same thing. the structure is fine. levels of interaction need to change, yes, but conflating the two is invalid.focus groups are slower than using the csm for feedback. because you have to form them. and they will be filled with specialists, with a narrower view, than the more generalist csm. that more general view is valuable.as for the turn over of members being removed, that would be 2 removed, and one resigned. hardly excessive. any csm candidate making promises beyond ""i'll represent this mind set"" are at best mislead. that's all the csm is for. it's valuable, but we're not game designers."
1/4/2016,"if the csm is not working ask the ones who are staying why they stay.even the most pessimistic have stayed on, doing what they can as they can. and then there are we optimists who accept that no 'pseudo governmental body' is going to be efficient or perfect and work with what we have. as for there are 'members of the community that feel that we should be abolished? there are also members of the community that think that pvp should be only consensual and flagged, that there should be a multitude of servers and that you should start with all the skills including titan v and make the game only about isk and possessions.the community has a wealth of opinions and quoting them is easy to support any good or foolish idea.focus groups are all well and good and i think there is a place for them in this game although we have not yet found the right way to implement them. but there is no beating the personal face to face frank discussion of sitting down at a table in ccp headquarters or even a bar after hours and discussing things. accountability? who did you vote for, what did you ask them to do, why did you vote for them? what did they promise to do? we sign an nda so we cannot talk about a lot of things that cross the table but did you read the minutes? did you look at attendance records for the people you think are 'yours'? have you made an effort?another election is around the corner. will you try to make the council one that does things or vote for some joke candidate in hopes of making this a self fulfilling prophecy that the csm is dead?m"
1/4/2016,"ccp can decide to shut down the csm at any time, if they believe it to not be useful to their purpose. until they do, second guessing the role of the csm to them is just rhetoric and agenda driven propaganda.like any other democratic process, it relies on people that believe in democracy to put their ideas for the game we all share forward, whatever they are, and other people to pay attention and vote. they can vote by blindly following orders, or they can educate themselves. the choice is up to each one of us. in the end, like for any democratic process, the voters get the representatives they deserve."

1/5/2016,when you are young you feel more passionate about things you want to change the world or eve for the better . bobmon spends a lot of time supporting eve online community from his articles in evenews to his presentations in fanfest .he deserves our support for csm .

1/5/2016,"bobmon is one of the more passionate people in eve these days. take it from me, more than anything you want passionate people who also know the game on csm. bobmon would be a great csm member for this purpose and he definitely has my vote."
1/5/2016,"i ran into joffs on the tweetfleet slack (invites from steve ronuken's page here!.. open it from igb). innocently enough, i asked him a question about how he sets up his own eve. i was interested in it because i have issues with input and gui of my own and i was very curious what he did to address his own limited mobility.he's a very open person, and in our talking he shared a picture with me of himself. i was quite struck by how sincere his expression in the photo seems.. but more than that i saw a quote written at the bottom that said, ""i just want to help you"".i think that quote describes joffs very well. he is a person who lives a very different kind of life than i do, in my opinion a more difficult life. but he is always very upbeat and positive and he wants to make a change in the world and make a name for himself.joffs is a pvper. he has quite an ego about his capabilities and i suggest you hit him up sometime for a discussion of fits and combat. i think if he were on csm he would give ccp and eve the time and dedicate csm needs (unlike a lot of people sitting in csm this year). he also knows what he's talking about, and is organized and persuasive.he has my vote."
1/5/2016,"i've voted for steve in every csm election since i joined eve. i don't agree with everything he believes, but he communicative with the player base (like mike is), he works hard, and he knows quite a bit about his own eve niche. he seems to have a genuine love for eve.not to mention, we share a love for abs."
1/5/2016,"e)wardecs, hisec content creation in general.so ill try doing this one a few bits at a time, as it can be a sensitive issue, so the complete version of this point may take a few iterations, but you are free and encouraged to ask questions.to begin, i do not in any way wish to further curtail what is left of high sec criminal mechanics, the current set of very limited high sec mechanics goes a long way to explain the why and the how of ganking. briefly, you've taken away every other way to generate content in hi, so of course, the antagonist minded players will learn to utilize what they have left to the fullest extent. i used to run a ganking corporation and have done a fair bit of it - it is part of the game, and you should be able to gank someone; the onus of defence lays on every pilot that does not want to be ganked. this is how it should be. if you want to see more interesting behaviour and better emergent gameplay, expand, not shrink, what people are allowed to do in hi sec. it currently has about as much depth as an atari 2600 game. i fully believe that wardecs need to have their cost structure inverted; a three man corp that wants to war-dec a major alliance, who should bave the resources, know how, and pilots to be able to defend itself, should basically be free. conversely, the large wardec corp that just finds the latest new player start up to crush it under its heel, that should be the expensive type of war to run. if phoebe was designed to let small entities affect sov, then why not let small entities actually affect player organizations much larger than themselves in hi?that being said, you have to ask why uedama , etc, are so violent; why are the most violent systems in the game in hi sec? well obviously their geography explains most of it, yes, but it really comes down to, where are the kids supposed to play? null sec is so absurdly safe, so remote, and so easily to defend that most antagonist minded players can quickly see that the higher isk killed per hour, or more feathers ruffled per hour, etc, are available in hi sec, and that basically, why bother trying to make content anywhere else when its so much better in hi sec? uedama, you can literally just undock a catalyst or talos and receive killmail, as opposed to null or low where targets are so rare and so skittish. basically that antagonists have been in large part pigeon holed into one form of antagonism by the hi sec rules, and one place, namely high sec, by the population density and the target availability. that is just not good overall.the mass exodus to null didn't happen in phoebe or with aegissov; this is explored in other posts as to why and how. however, even if it did, it still wouldn't change hi sec as being king for naughty players; null and low mechanics just make it so incredibly easy to stay safe that many have just stopped bothering with those areas. why hunt for a wild caught hulk when you can just snag a factory farmed one in hi sec? you'd have a healthier game when the best place for most antagonist content generation was not restricted to a few systems in hi sec - put some tools back in low and null so antagonists actually have a reason to be out there, give them options. part of this means, yes, making other areas actually worth living in so there are people to antagonize, and another part of this means actually letting the antagonists have a chance at being naughty. oh, and if you think you are reading too much in this thread, and there's too much text, remember you are supposed to be electing a communicator. look at the other threads, and make your own calls there people. slogans and vague themes alone do not a candidate make. while i am doing my best to remain brief, rest assured i would not be daunted to actually write significantly more on any given topic. as a player of the game, i am interested in player opinions of things, and would both love to hear from you, and, in an official capacity, love to elaborate those opinions to people who need to hear them. yes, i do not have a big reddit presence, etc, but i am at least a little active on the eve-o forums."

1/6/2016,"k)grrgoonsso last year i ran, not endorsed by mind you, but ran as a member of goonswarm. i have come to see the error of my ways. however, i do believe there is nothing quite so honest as a reformed goon. some of you may think this is horsefeatherrs, but i was the #16 top imperium killer in october according to gevlon, for what that's worth, and apparently #35 in december. not bad for a small time operator! i don't just say grr goons, ladies and gentlemen, grr goons is a way of life for me! anyway, if you are looking for someone who is unapologetically grr goons to balance out all the candidates that are owned by them (or will be owned by them 30 minutes after the results are announced ) , look no further. i fully admit that i drank the kool aid, and you should too; for every blue they put on the map, for every conflict they prevent from happening, new eden is a more mundane place, and for what? new eden is supposed to be a veritable maelstrom of conflict; large scale organized stagnation does the cluster no good. no matter what mechanics are implemented in game to try and spur conflict, one thing remains crystal clear; goons do not actually like conflict and they will do anything possible to fight changes politically or militarily."

1/7/2016,your alliance name is offensive
1/7/2016,what happened to your last csm11 thread?
1/7/2016,"typical goon strategy. their war strategy has always been to never give good fights, instead preferring to only completely steam roll or use weaponzied boredom. in this case i think we are thinking the same thing, where goons wish every voice they cannot get completely lobbying for their empire to be as inarticulate and and ineffectual as possible, effectively giving more power to themselves for lack of an opposition, analogous to the weaponized boredom where they cannot win overwhelmingly.the goon dream for this csm is as many carrier politicians as can be ballot stuffed into power, and as many candidates that cannot operate effectively, giving them a total monopoly on player voice, despite the fact such people are not actually players like you and i; they are politicians, what business do they have voicing players like us?"
1/7/2016,i will vote xenuria
1/7/2016,"forgive me but i really don't see how this conspiracy has any root in reality. goons and the imperium seem more interested in eve online not dying from my perspective. there have been no closed doors to me since my entry into the hegemony. nobody has denied me information or access of any kind and profound trust has been placed in me as a consultant and an adviser to a wide range of matters. if there was any grand conspiracy the chances are i would have stumbled across it by now. that said, goons do have a spotty past when it comes to eve online but just the same could easily be said of their greatest enemies. let us not forget band of brothers and the very corruption and scandal that necessitated the birth of the csm. put down the torches and pitchforks, if there was something within goons remotely resembling the conspiratorial pipe dreams concocted by gevlon and the likes of him; i would be the first person to stand on a box and holler about it."
1/7/2016,"a) it's not a conspiracy (though you did a nice strawman of the argument); b) it's a hard sell to ask us to trust you and goons, when you're a sellout, liar and buzzword politician; c) i don't think the argument against you is any goon conspiracy, since there are plenty of reasons to discount you as a viable representative (among others, you're either barking mad or intentionally acting like an obtuse and megalomaniacal joke candidate to troll)."
1/7/2016,"he has some good ideas and seems to support a transparent csm (although i want to see all csm no longer given access to propriety information, bobmon might not be all the way there yet)so thusfar, he has my support and i think would make a good member. he's certainty going to be much more communicative then past members tend to be."

1/8/2016,6-7 chars might be a good option.
1/8/2016,if you are strolling around your hanger make sure you keep your id on you all all times.the forum ss will lock you up
1/8/2016,no. running on the platform that gevlon did was just plain disrespectful and juvenile.
1/8/2016,incorrect. it's painfully obvious that they gladly trade the health of the game overall for the health of their empire. they would much rather have control over people and ration out content than see their empire weakened.they have become what they once rallied to stop.
1/8/2016,"i think there is a crucial piece of logic missing from your master stroke~.without eve online, there is no space empire.to the best of my knowledge there is no ""content rationing"" happening in the imperium. i have never seen anybody stop somebody from participating in a fleet op by saying ""woah there buddy haven't you had a little too much content today? sit this one out.""or maybe you simply don't understand me, this process or what is at stake."
1/8/2016,"they don't need eve online to persist once they have cashed in their shares of website ad revenue or kickstarters. you have a very naive understanding of high level goonery.of course content is rationed, very carefully, very calculatingly. they keep perfect stasis on 2/3 of the map such that there cannot be a reasonable threat to their security. eve is supposed to be about vibrant, byzantine empires rising and falling on the fickle whims of very human gods; capsuleers. any empire purely devoted to maintaining the past status quo in it's entirely is an empire in decline, yet they are happy to see such a gradual decline in the game and their empire so long as it feeds more than their in game wallets. give karmafleet some fcs, have them toss cheap, disposable fleets around with no consequence, and their fresh crop of newbies is placated and mollified. they are rationed out cheap, meaningless content - gone is the gravity of actual fights, over things that may have meaning. they fed a two-bit propaganda stream about 'our people' and how joining the imperium is 'winning', when in all actuality, it is losing by essentially removing all of the chips from the table; what fun is gambling, risking, and playing, when all of these are removed and all conflict is sport with no gravitas?this is the status quo they want to preserve, and content rationing is quite effective at it."
1/8/2016,perfect stasis eh? i think a little thing called dotlan would disagree with you. but don't let me crush your grandiose conspiracy pipe dream. how about you run for csm.
1/8/2016,"this is some fantastic, nuclear-grade salt right here."
1/8/2016,"i've been subbed nonstop since 2011. quazerknocks is a real thing - lazerhawks, hard knocks, and the remnants of quantum explosion have banded together to push everyone else out of c6 magnetar space and succeeded, then have proceeded to set up renters/alts in those systems to farm the sites."
1/8/2016,"my content isn't rationed :colbert:i know you think ""you've seen both sides"" but you are really talking out of your rear end on this subject. you are literally arguing with xenuria and looking like the crazy one.xenuria for csm!"
1/8/2016,"content isn't being rationed by goons, there isn't more of it up californi-way."
1/8/2016,on page 4 and i'm not sure what you are about. you kind of just seem like a gimmick to be honest.
1/8/2016,do you have a question about my campaign?
1/8/2016,list 3 ways you plan to reform the csm.
1/8/2016,"i already did, please check the first page of the thread where i talk about white paper reform and related systems."
1/8/2016,"yeah i did that. so your relevant parts:""reform in the context of the csm would entail overhauling the white paper, installing safety measures, changing the language used when discussing certain topics, advocating and pushing for policy changes that encourage honesty but discourage superficial posturing. i suppose the problem is that when i say reform i expect people to know what i mean without me having to list any number of things that are reformative.for me it's sometimes difficult for me to explain what i mean without a specific context. let me give you an example.q what are your reforms?a uhhh q how would you reform the csm nda?a i would construct a spanning tree rubric with dates and subject tags that allowed for everybody under nda to know explicitly what they are and are not allowed to discuss and with whom. ""1. overhauling the white paper.in what way?2. installing safety measures.such as?3. changing the language used when discussing topics.changing the language from what to what?4. advocating policies that encourage honesty but discourage superficial posturing.""discourage superficial posturing""...could start with your posts."

1/8/2016,some basicsi am not part of a power block. meaning a vote for me means you are gaining a community member not a puppet. because power blocks are so great at voting for people that fail so hard at this i feel i have to put this out there under qualifications... wait for it.... i will show up to csm meetings (and actually participate in the process in a meaningful way). *mic drop.*slowly picks mic back upopen for questions
1/8/2016,"never met you, read a lot of your posts in various locations, you have a good grasp of the game and its mechanics, particularly in null and low. my questions for you, 1. how do you entice the players away from the ""peaceful, almost agrarian"" stagnation that litters much of null? everyone talks about mechanics, but it is people and their attitudes that have caused the stagnation, if people wanted to fight, there are plenty of opportunities to do so2. you don't like the phoebe jump changes, what do you propose to fix them? would you agree that regardless of your personal feelings towards the changes, they have in fact meant more capital ships are used? ie smaller entities that were always fearful of the nearest null-bloc landing on them, now use them as that is less likely.3. same question for aegis sov, what changes would you propose? i was in an alliance that never thought we would play in sov due to the nature of it, and our rl first approach, but with aegis, we had a crack, had some fun, though inevitably learned that smaller groups need some highly motivated individuals to carry a heavy workload for sov to work, under old or new mechanics.appreciate you responding to this, look forward to hearing your answers."
1/9/2016,i mean if people go in and try to entosis adm6 systems...you're doing it wrong.
1/9/2016,"i've been liken to xenuria in the way i engage people in this game and how i come off and i've been banned from pl services just like him. probably also because i've been told i have the aura of digi. which i don't necessarily think this is a bad thing as my rl background is similar to his. anyways my point of views, the way i fairly assess and conduct myself in eve and put people straight on blast as needed.. no matter who they are in game are similar to xenuria. we need this for the csm, very badly. i will have all my votes for xenuria. i will champion him thru my alliance to look past his alliance affiliation and vote for him. anyone who knows xenuria knows that he doesn't sell out and there is no changing him, you simple love or hate and he's really hard to hate. if you do hate him i would say your a bandwagoning circle jerk mindless fool who can't think for themselves and allow others to influence your views on someone you never got to know. get to know xenuria, try to understand him, and see that he is what the playerbase deserves and needs.xenuria for csm xi 2016follow me on twitter @fr3sh0ps"
1/9/2016,"ah, hole squad. the last bastion of true goonyness. literally the only reserve of those who live for the sting of battle, the rush of the dunk, and the sheepish sigh of the welp. sadly, content is meted too you to as well. what a world this would be if you could shoot fcon and sma, and their ilk? you are no better than who you can stomach being blue to. i have, and it left me feeling blue. amazingly this was cured within hours of leaving, just not in me, but in all who have left your facade. you may call me crazy in an effort to obscure the points i have raised, yes, but you can't call every corp, alliance, and personality that has left the imperium lately crazy too; they have all come to the same conclusion as i, and yes, very much so have seen both sides. people who have left the imperium on their own accord are just plain offensive; just the idea that there could be a better play experience out side of 'our people' is anathema to your propaganda. being blue to the majority of null is rationing the content available to your members. cloud ring, one of the few places on the map with the proper people and location to see some the driving principles of aegis sov work, was so offensive to your leadership that they had no choice but to burn down the entire region. the idea that people could have sov space which fostered interaction among smaller entities was philosophically objectionable to their monolithic ideas of how space should be governed. the south and south east of the map hums the way the entire cluster should, but goons won't have that. they don't want content, they don't want anything to change; they simply want to cling to their empire. lowsec thus becomes the place to find small quanta of content to placate the members, to give them purpose in a world where it has been taken away from them, and enemies to fight in a world where they have been removed."
1/9/2016,"the goons do have a vested interest in seeing the game thrive however they do often get to the point where they want ccp to do something and ccp doesn't want to (or doesn't want to yet) so the goons manipulate the feature until they make their point and ccp fix it.xenuria is the cfc ""burn it to the ground"" method as they've given up trying to get ccp to listen and are now trying to force ccp's hand. also xenuria, you don't answer questions so there's no point asking if someone has any."
1/9/2016,if i understand you correctly:i am a bad csm candidate because i am in goons.goons are bad because they ration content.you can tell they are rationing content because you know and have seen things~you also have knowledge of how sov should~ be and your way is the right way.did i miss anything?
1/9/2016,...a good post?
1/9/2016,"you mean that my understanding should be worse than yours? when your understanding of stv (the election process) is flawed at every level; you couldn't cite a single time you were endorsed by a major null-sec organisation (or whether them placing you on their ballot should impact you negatively compared to not being on there at all); you lied about your voter base being 90% women and tried to back it up by something irrelevant; your ideas from your last csm 11 thread were either meaningless or revealed to be incoherent; and your csm reform idea has earlier contained abolishing elections for the csm (but without making it ccp-picked, leaving it an open question how you think it should be...), because of voter fraud that you couldn't even point to any theoretically possible examples of (and of course, no empirical either).this is before going back to your claims about when the mittani misquotes you, or your old election video rants, but i think there's a goldmine for an eve standup comedian who wants to parody you.in essense, there was a reason why you weren't elected before. not only because of your dishonesty in debating, or your idiocy when it comes to election mechanics or csm stuff, and the irrelevance or absurdity of your platforms thus far. if you get in now, it's on the back of goon votes, either because they vote for anyone from the cfc, or because goon leadership places you on their official ballot, in which case they do so for a reason.when your qualifications as a candidate are reduced to being a troll (or honest idiot, it's still possible), it would be a weird reaon to place you on a ballot with other legitimate candidates. why would anyone well-informed do so?most likely, to either limit other candidates' options to get elected or to make the csm a laughingstock now that the whitepaper might be up for review.in other words, we can actually identify possibilities as to why you might become an official goon candidate, and neither are good for the game or the csm. paraphrasing from a former goon ceo, you're not out to ruin the game, you're out to ruin our game."
1/9/2016,do you have any specific questions about my platform or do you just want to keep attacking me?
1/9/2016,"back when i did ask specific questions, you ignored them, so though it's a nice dodge, it doesn't really work for someone with your record.but if you want to, you can take a look at this:"
1/9/2016,you ignored my questions too.
1/9/2016,"yup what sibbs said, joffy is a genuinely nice guy and just wants to help other people. i don't for one second think joffy has a hidden selfish motive, he's just genuinely that way and his time in channels such as b4r shows that he's not just there for the glory and self promotion.joffy is the kind of person we need in the csm."
1/9/2016,i don't know joffy but i live in low sec and i like the view he has on how to make it better. joffy has my vote.
1/9/2016,what would you change about wardecs?what would you do to encourage players to go beyond just highsec?
1/9/2016,could you clarify what would like to see happen for fw in the future? and how you would represent the people flying in fw? i think a lot of the people flying in fw were impressed by your input to the fw sessions in last years minutes.....
1/10/2016,"on topic:and what would your platform be? would you be so kind to put it in, like, 5 (more or less) clear points!?"
1/10/2016,"please see the first post of the thread also known as the op or ""original post""."
1/10/2016,could you answer these questions?
1/10/2016,no i cannot. i am not on the csm yet and thus not privy to the majority of information that would inform the specifics of my platform.
1/10/2016,"judging by your ""op"" you're running solely to reform csm, and those reforms are outlined by a goonswarm lead diplomat, and not you.can you outline your ""reforms"" in 5 simple points, with clear and concise sentences? please!?"
1/10/2016,"i am sorry if my explanation of my goals is not par with what you are looking for. there are simply things that are impossible for me to know. i am a csm candidate, i am not on the csm. my hope is that i have demonstrably proven to as many people as possible that i have the skill set and the aptitude to acomplish meaningful reform."
1/10/2016,"by having no clue, by lying all the time, by not answering questions or, just every once in a while, honestly admitting that you have no idea what the csm does under which rules and regulations, and how to reform it?you think even less of your voters than i do.edit: and i am just going to point out that you again failed to answer questions related to your campaigns. not disappointed, since i knew you don't have any real answers to anything, seeing as you are a joke candidate."
1/10/2016,"so, basically you have 2 complete sentences written by yourself in op, excluding some history lesson, about what you want to accomplish if elected and you can't or won't put forth anythin more meaningfull than vague ""reforms"" buzzwords. let's try a different approach then:what problems, besides some csm-ccp drama, will csm reform solve?"
1/10/2016,accusing me of being a liar isn't only comical it's a personal attack. at the very least back up your accusation with some evidence.
1/10/2016,"you mean the evidence that i continually quoted for you, in the last thread, and continually ask you to respond to?if you took two minutes to read my allegations and questions, you'd know exactly why i know you're lying (feel free to add whatever you haven't made public if you so desire). you'd also know why you're continuously deceptive and unreliable. you won't even quote when i quote the sources and claims, and i'm guessing it's because you'd then pretty much have to acknowledge that dishonesty is one of your defining traits?"
1/10/2016,"""we have to vote the bill in before we know what it says.""literally xenuria."
1/10/2016,"xenuria, you have my vote this year. i am not joking.after fozziesov making null sec a more shallow game and those stupid new destroyers, which destroyed the frigate meta after years of balancing work, you are the candidate that ccp deserves.another reason to vote for you is skill injectors / extractors.eve keeps on selling out..so much stupid from the same team at ccp."
1/10/2016,you cant go bobwrong with a vote for bobmon!
1/10/2016,bobmom will get my vote for csm!a good man that deserves my vote.+1hope you get in.csm needs you and more important ccp and eve needs you there!

1/10/2016,"i've worked with joffy quite a bit over the last 12 months. he is quite possibly the nicest, most genuine person i have ever met in eve. his work with b4r does nothing but solidify that. i would love to see joffy be a voice for lowsec and disabled players on the csm... i can't think of anyone better for the job. he would be an asset to have on the csm."
1/10/2016,"i'm here to say i support erika as well! eve-radio has kept me coming back to this game over the years. i am also an industrialist in nullsec so we share a lot of the same goals and interests. she is also a great person in real life and has personally helped me out of a tough situation i was in. i can never thank her enough for that. after reading over her intro posts and knowing the kind of human being she really is, i feel she would be a great addition to this years csm.please cast a vote for erika mizune when the time comes."

1/10/2016,"from personal experience last year, these cap stable guys treat candidates fairly."
1/10/2016,the current mechanic just isn't that good. its not a fight over anything. and the defense has no win conditions other than starving kills to get them to go away. this isn't really helping get quality pvp. lost of catching solo newbies going to sell ore in their retrievers. lets make it worth something for 1. currently small corps are 50 million isk to deck for a week. in my opinion concord is going for less than a vegas hooker so just saying that should change to be higher. win conditions for both sides. so citadels and other structures are a good place to build this off of. vulnerability timers. i'm open to everyone's views and would love to hold a open meetings about this if elected. point 2 getting people out of high sec.so lets accept there are a group that wont leave high sec regardless of motivation. we don't really care about them in this part.everyone else is looking for isk related content. content being key to this. having lived in null for a few years in various conditions the pvp is interesting the politics is fun and the grinding is relentless. i think the easiest way to do this is grow group options. adding harder anoms that require small fleets will grow this exponentially. now here is where you might hate me might like me. the jump changes with fatigue are necessary as it make it do its easier to defend space so smaller groups can move out and take space. i'm of the opinion low sec is the breeding ground for groups looking to do this so again this comes to benefits and content in low sec needs revamping. wormholes are proof of this as a concept. create more to do make them do it in fleets and they will risk ridiculous volumes of isk for the rewards. because of this the pvp is great there. also the volume of high sec to null sec wormholes needs to be larger. for 2 reasons. 1 wormholes are a quick way to set up a supply route. without a jump freighter. so they are low sp requirements to use. also this makes it easier for smaller groups to live out in deeper null sec spaces. making the life out there a litter easier... having lived in omist for a time i can say its sucks living that far out. so logistics made easier in small ways will help with this and of course will build content. so in short content options are key to gaining interest to get more people out there. alliances do this with pvp but often times players get bored. higher level in alliances its more interesting because the player driven content is might more interesting but that is limited to a few.
1/10/2016,"low end prices for wardecs could be raised...but the top end should be lowered as well. however ""win conditions"" is fairly vague. you also make the mistake in thinking that ""fair fights"" are necessary. a wolf is going to eat a sheep. we don't handicap the wolf in order to give the sheep a chance.your 2nd point is good. i feel as though 0.0 needs to have a higher ratio of rewards vs highsec."
1/10/2016,the win conditions allow both sides opportunity to end the war. its' vague because i think picking a exact example of what this might include without input form interested parties would be a little silly. i'm open to a more user friendly csm that people can access a bit more with events that are publicized a bit more.

1/11/2016,"csm reform is needed, given that every one of the last 10 councils has had similar patterns of communications issues with ccp and/or nda-related drama. what kind of reform i don't know, given the organizational structure of the institution. i sometimes wonder if any reform is possible that would address the most pressing recurrent issues.however, my own experience on the csm plus observable history suggests that a csm reform platform is likely to get at best a tiny slice of time from the scant few devs who oversee/manage the csm project. if you can't get any attention from them or other council members on your csm reform issues, what game-related expertise do you bring to the party so that you can be an actively contributing council member the rest of the time?"
1/11/2016,"i'm pretty sure xenuria actually has answered a question like that back in his csm10 thread. i'm currently around page 11, so when i get the exact quote, i'll get back to you.but back then, the answer was that xenuria would listen to the other csm people on such subjects.edit: here are the relevant quotes, all are visible on page 14:quote:xenuria1. i am not very experienced with cloaking or camping so i would defer to somebody who was.quote:kiryen o'bannonfinally, one other question - obviously the csm will not spend all of its time on your issues. what do you plan to advocate for when not dealing with csm-selection-related items?quote:xenuriai am happy to do whatever else needs doing.the rest of the thread is still hilarious. xenuria has perfected the art of not answering questions - several rl politicians could look at this and learn something from it!of course, xenurias election threads are always a laugh to read through. for example, xenuria thought that being placed on the bottom of a ballot, compared to not being on a ballot at all, can hurt a candidates chances (xenuria also thought that any null-sec coalition had placed him on their ballots, but that is likely born out of ignorance of the voting system, to explain why a complete joke and failure like him can't be elected by its own rights - it hurts his ego to have it evaluated by meeting reality), or that cfc candidates have been in majority for years, or that 90% of his voter base is female... or plenty of other idiotic things. and he must know he's lying, because he gives sources that clearly does not say what he lies about all the time.the only thing in this that surprises me is that gsf have decided to allow him in, and now some goons say that they'll support him. if xenuria gets elected, it's because he joined those who have been his ""best"" argument for reform (namely that the many, organised votes of the cfc gets results in elections). i find it hilarious that xenuria, in order to get elected, joins those who he earlier said he'd fight against, simply because they have the organisation that can get people elected irregardless of a candidates actual appeal or abilities!"
1/11/2016,"solid question.i have a really good understanding of player behavioral patterns when it comes to pve and the value of vanity items. i have lived in high sec space for extended periods of time and learned a great deal about the mentality of players there. i think if at any point csm/ccp discussions had to do with psychology or behavioral analysis of a particular aspect of game-play, i would be able to contribute insights in a meaningful way."

1/11/2016,"never spit in a well you may have to drink from, do not try to put out a fire with gasoline.so i'm going to be blunt here. if you are disenfranchised with the csm process, the csm candidates, etc., electing troll candidates who will exacerbate the issues with the csm and it is not the proper way to accomplish things. i too am quite sickened with the current csm, but attempting to punish players or ccp by electing joke or troll candidates will just make things worse. we just haven't seen many (there are a few, you know who you are ) actual communicators interested in fostering good player-developer relationships. we have a bunch of people who either come to the table with agendas, a sense of entitlement, a sense of disenfranchisement, or other forms of bitter that just prevent progress outright. downward spirals are something you have a limited window to fix.ccp should have the exclusive right to bar candidates from the csm either based on whatever criteria they want, or from previous csm performances.elect communicators, elect people who know how to listen and to collaborate."

1/11/2016,right now i am very happy with faction warfare lowsec. the fights have been amazing and the felling of low sec as a warzone has never in my experience been more real. black rise is where i know best so what i use for the basses of my opinion. null sec still seems to be in a state of flux and semi empty but i have hope that it's changing. the meta has seen a small shift with command dessies and t2 frig logi how far this will go in low or null sec remains to be seen but they offer players fun options for a fight. hopefuly everyone having as much fun as i am an lets get a discussion going about what we as players want to see in game so we can give feedback to ccp about this game that i and hopefully you love to play.
1/11/2016,"see, this one i really, really disagree with. i want to agree with it, as cloaky camping its terrible game play, but there's literally no way to actually harass people in null sec without cloaky camping them. nullsec is absurdly safe thanks to local, intel channels, derivative tools that use local and intel channels, distance, fewer wormholes to null, territory far away from were antagonists can resupply or escalate, and the ability for the defender to escalate infinitely. until there is a way to add some risk back to it, cloaky camping is really the only way to effectively antagonize sov residents; ess was a nice concept, but it has largely failed because people either do not use them or have rats to defend them, and the best thing to do when a neutral is either in your system, or a few jumps out is still simply to dock - avoidance. almost every ratting ship out there is capable of leaving a site and getting safe well before being at risk; 99% of the time it is not the hunter being good that gets someone caught in null, its the ratter being careless. game play where one side disproportionately holds every advantage possible is quite boring, i.e. there is still no good way for a roaming gang to cause trouble to the point where defending sov space actually matters. basically deep null could be so effectively locked down to the point where there is no risk at all, and that is a terrible thing. i would be fine with this if local had a delay, or there was some other way to actually get to ratters...but there isn't really."
1/12/2016,"my goodness -the whine!first and foremost, if you are a ceo and you know that you will be away for awhile, pull your stuff and appoint someone to at least director position.second, if you have been gone from the game for longer than a year, do you really have rights to anything in the corp anymore, specially things with in hangers that are accessible to corp members.third - purpose this, if you are a person who has been gone for awhile or you are a member of a corp that has inactive leadership and are afraid the ceo will lose out on ""their items"" have all corp assests given to the current ceo and give someone else leadership.me personally, if i was in a corp with an inactive ceo, i would just cut my lose and say **** 'em. no matter what happens, someone is getting bent over and ****ed up the tail pipe no matter what happens. fire stone, if you want an active corp and access to bpos for copying and such. divine demise doors are open.

1/12/2016,"no, all taking him off the ballot shows is that ccp doesn't put up with trolls who outright state they will waste the time and effort of everyone involved in the process just to push an ideological point. i think its perfectly fair to expect those who put themselves forward for the csm to actually be interested in doing csm related things.like malcanis said, gevlons platform could be most simply represented by a 'none of the above' button."
1/12/2016,thanks for your reply. i expect that kind of contribution could be very useful indeed.
1/12/2016,"""e"" for effort but the comments you find such a laugh to read through were written by a young person roughly six years ago. people--especially at xenuria's age then--tend to mature and change for the better over such a long time. might be an idea to give him the benefit of the doubt on that one, don't crucify him for mistakes or questionable behavior that occurred in ancient history, and confine your assessment of his candidacy to his current platform and how he conducts himself in the here and now. that said, in reference to his six year old comments, i'm willing to believe that as a csm he'll still be on board with listening to more knowledgeable others on given topics and will energetically pitch in where he has skills and knowledge to apply. as for his social interaction skills and ability to collaborate effectively, he seems to be aware of his own shortcomings. hopefully if (when?) he is elected, he will make an honest effort to be a productive csm and his fellow council members and ccp will make an honest effort to work with him rather than simply dismiss him.does this mean i plan to vote for him? probably not...he doesn't need my vote to get elected. and hey, he might end up being a terrible csm; i can't predict the future and i've been *very* wrong about some past candidates. however, i happen to believe that everyone deserves respectful consideration based on current and relevant information, including xenuria."
1/12/2016,"you subtract 2014-05-25 from 2016-01-12 and get 6 years? besides, xenuria ran for the first time way back, and so must be 21 + the years since then. when someone hasn't changed, and still advocate the same idiotic ideas as 1, 2, 3 or more years ago, there's not really any doubt.so xenuria will pitch in at no time during his csm tenure, and will always listen to the other csm members? then why have him there?you seem to have skipped both this, his old csm11 and his csm10 threads. check out his history and you'll confirm that xenurias issues aren't just social interaction, it's also megalomania and a messiah complex, plus inability to ever listen to criticism or answer questions. a lot of other people tried to help him in csm10/11 (and probably even earlier, but i can't quite remember), but were written off as trolls. i still don't get why they ever tried to improve xenurias campaign since i find it futile, but they made an honest effort. no self-reflection from xenuria so far.xenuria is either a troll candidate or a deluded idiot. it's not really viable to work with him in either scenario.(i got to the quote limit) ""i happen to believe that everyone deserves respectful consideration based on current and relevant information, including xenuria.""as do i. it's just that xenuria doesn't look too well in such a comparison either, and if cfc leadership really does endorse him, he stands a real chance of getting in. that makes it less fun to watch his csm threads than it was in other years, where it was an absolute trainwreck you could enjoy whenever you had spare time."
1/12/2016,"absolute reading fail on my part ... somehow i misread ""csm10"" as ""2010"" and did stupidmath. i still stand by my statement that people can change for the better and we should focus on the now and be willing to acknowledge positive change when we see it."
1/12/2016,bobmon will be one of the guys i vote for.he has put an impressive amount of work into en24 as well as organizing evesterdam.if he keeps up his work ethic he will make a great csm.
1/12/2016,"hello ladies, gentlemen and fidos,i am here to formally announce my intended candidacy for csm 11.now -of course- you<U+FFFD>re probably wondering who i am to be running for csm, especially considering the relatively space famous nature of my running mates. well, as you can see on the top left, my name is jin<U+FFFD>taan, and i am a member of cva. more specifically however, i am an fc within the provibloc coalition. i<U+FFFD>ve experienced quite a lot of my time in eve through this lens, from bombing brave newbies and pl, to crafting about as many fits as there are ships in the game, for solo pvp or fleet combat.but, in addition to that, i<U+FFFD>ve experienced a good amount of the content that is available in the game. i<U+FFFD>ve lived everywhere from hisec to wh<U+FFFD>s, and tried to experience as much as i can in each of those locations, diving in with a spreadsheet in one hand and dragging a few friends along with the other. i<U+FFFD>ve mined, i<U+FFFD>ve hauled, i<U+FFFD>ve built, i<U+FFFD>ve fced incursions in hisec and nullsec, i<U+FFFD>ve run moon mining poses and strategic deathstars, i<U+FFFD>ve led oldschool dominion sov wars from both sides, and i<U+FFFD>m currently fighting over fozziesov timers with pl. and that<U+FFFD>s just a fine selection of it. if you<U+FFFD>ve done something i haven<U+FFFD>t, chances are you can get me to try it atleast once.outside of the game however, i<U+FFFD>m aaron denyer. i<U+FFFD>m a design engineer, and work with ge and airbus as a subcontractor. whilst i understand and deeply respect some of my fellow csm candidates desire for privacy, i think my real life background could be of note. i<U+FFFD>m used to attending meetings, and utilizing critical thinking within them to help stop one viewpoint from being drowned out. plus, at the end of the day, i intend to come to fanfest. so expecting people to not know who i am in real life would be kind of defeating the point, as meeting up with the people you<U+FFFD>ve known for years through eve is half the point of it.if i am elected to join the ranks of the csm, i intend to focus on two main things that i believe i have expertise in; fleet combat & alternative playstyles.the former is rather self explanatory, but i feel it<U+FFFD>s necessary to explain myself with the second part of that. alternative playstyles are something that has been typically under represented in the csm, with the vast majority of candidates and electee<U+FFFD>s being nbsi, despite the incredible popularity of npsi, and an (admittedly small) nullsec coalition based around nrds. oftentimes the minor issues that affect the communities built around these ideas are overlooked, such as the original thoughts on removing fleet warps, or the relatively small number of standing slots available on an alliance level. these are the kinds of things that could seem like inconsequential issues to those who haven<U+FFFD>t dealt with the practicalities of working within them, but are in reality a huge pain in the arse for anyone who has to do so.these communities are an important part of the vibrant cloth that is eve online<U+FFFD>s society. they provide low barrier to entry for new players to try various experiences that are otherwise daunting to try, and i<U+FFFD>d say that having some 3 month old character try pvp in spectre fleet, or mine ore in providence does more for the player retention rate than anything else.and, with that, we come to why i want to join the csm.i want to join the csm because eve has been a part of my life for around 5 years. by the time i am old enough to drink in iceland, i will have played this game for a third of my life. it is something that i love, and something that i have dedicated a huge amount of time and thought towards. i want to join the csm because i want to help this game get better, in any way i can.if you would like to contact me outside of the forum thread for any reason, feel free to mail me in game or at jintaaneve@gmail.com.further information/interviews for your pleasure;interview with eveguardianinterview with eve_ntmy thoughts on the battlecruisers at en24guesting on the jeffraider showexamining how top-down economies impact the game"

1/12/2016,hello!my name is lorelei and i am announcing my candidacy for csm xi. i am running on a platform that is focussed on high sec. i am a self-confessed high sec carebear and am proud of it. i have analysed the commitments planned/coming up in my life for the next year and have decided that i can afford the time to run for csm xi!this is my campaign thread from last year:
1/12/2016,"there's a 99% way to avoid being ganked, and that's being attentive. why try to fix what isn't broken at all?"
1/12/2016,"steve's work is amazing, and he's somehow tireless and tirelessly positive. definitely has my vote!that said, steve, care to advocate for settlement of new space? ;)"
1/12/2016,"i have been waiting for this thread, just to say that i fully endorse steve for csm xi. he never fails to impress with his technical ability and a willingness to try and understand anything he doesn't already know. as to the relationship with ccp, i feel he is one of the guys that will keep it going in the good way should he be successful in re-election."
1/12/2016,don't know him personally but i've only heard bad things about the group of pompous baboons that he is leading. they worship him like a god and rightfully so as they wouldn't be anywhere without him.how could you ever expect someone like that to try to achieve anything that is not beneficial to his corp? plus he plays way too much eve to be a balanced person.-1
1/12/2016,so you want some noobcorp spreadsheet online paperpusher type of fellow for csm? plz czech yourself and go back to where you came from because it sounds like you are the real baboon.
1/12/2016,i feel marginalized by these spurious comments.
1/12/2016,noobman is probably my favorite wh candidate that has ever run for csm! also i think that he has a lot of potential to be the best wh candidate that the wh community has had in a long time.
1/12/2016,"me and judge go back to the days of a youtuber and twitch streamer making a full public entrance into eve and a high sec group/alliance.needless to say the war decs were chaos the recruitment was chaos and the welping was real. eve was experienced.above all, friendship and honour has stayed no matter what chaos i managed to try to cause.the judge for csmlet the court (get it judge? court?) have it's day."
1/12/2016,"co2 is blue to cfc.cfc is part of the root cause of a myriad of issues.a real nullsec candidate would only be believable if they were from smaller entities that actually play the game, rather than being pawns in a greater sphere of blues. why would i vote for someone that only knows how to submit, rather than to prosper on their own. why would i vote for someone who is grossly out of touch with nullsec by virtue of having thousands of blues?"
1/12/2016,vic has a very good point here. npc null pockets in more places gives people a stepping stone to the sov regions nearby.having lived in syndicate for awhile now i understand how hard it is to be evicted from npc null. its all about will power and true control of space. this would allow many groups a chance to get a foothold near sov and eventually try to take a piece for themselves.
1/12/2016,"tightening up ly distances in some areas would be good too. there are vast areas of null entry that are impossible to get caps to. the unintentional fortresses created by the arbitrary 5ly jump range needs to be addressed. oh, and vic gets my vote, and my hammer."
1/12/2016,"i cut out a lot of vic's text here but i only want to focus on a few points. barleguet was awesome. my old alliances used to fly there expressly to fight brave and we fought there a lot. when brave moved to yz-lql we would trek out there to fight them as well. they were close enough to syndicate to fly their in small ships. which of course is another thing vic mentioned space is too big for anything big and slow to get around. my battleships have gathered so much rust and dust as i have no reason to fly them as they suck so hard.there was a lot of charm in smashing that venture in the belt. his friends would show up to fight shortly afterwards and glorious melee in space would commence. the space hornets were stirred up and it was run and gun for awhile until you died or killed enough hornets that they simmered back down.his comments about tishu and oss are very true. syndicate has a few decent groups that get form up enough people to fight each other on a semi-often basis. i've fought both with and against most of the other units in syndicate. whenever i've left the region it seems like i would fly 30 jumps to not fight anyone and then fly homei slightly disagree as you can definitely make some isk out in npc null, however his main point is to get enough concentration of players to have decent conflict you need enough isk generators in the area to keep people viable enough to stick around and currently there is continually shifting of people into an area of syndicate and then there aren't enough anoms and scan sites, ratting belts etc to be able to keep them up with enough isk to stay active and then they **** out of the area and then we fall back into their not being enough people to get fights very often. rinse and repeat adnauseum.and just in case people think i'm too big of a vic supporter..."
1/12/2016,heimotz is also on those kills on vic by the way...
1/12/2016,"hi folks,i am utari onzo and i am asking for your votes to join the 11th csm.who am i - eveas the title says, i'm utari onzo, member of pentag blade and the cva alliance. i've been playing eve since april of 2013, so just around 2 1/2 years. in that time i've done a lot, and learned plenty about the game and community. i've mined and missioned in hisec, got into pvp after my first experiance of wardec, and been in wormholes, faction warfare lowsec and nullsec. i've flown for the cfc/imperium and provi-bloc, various smaller outfits in wormholes and for the amarr militia, and have experianced a wide range of both pvp and pve content eve has to offer.alongside my game antics, i am also an active roleplayer, with ties to the amarr bloc. i have a passion for the lore of this game, and have partaken in both ccp sponsored, and player run, live events. i was also present for the amarr unity event in which we got ambushed by drifters, and flew as a retainer to laerise for the amarr championship.my primary interests in the game are mid to large combat fleets, logistics and carriers. i've extensive experiance logi anchoring for the corps/alliances i join, as well as a stint for a couple of npsi fleets run by sleeper social club while i was in 13. i also have plenty of triage experiance, and is one of the thrills i get out of 0.0/w-space fights.who am i - real lifei'm david thurlow. i work as a lead scaffolder, which means i do a dirty and physical job, so eve is my release. i don't do corporate meetings, or wear a suit, but my job certainly gives me experiance in dealing with people, especially under pressure. i think my work makes me a ""to the point person"" but at the same time i know how to do it politely. work in the construction industry in london is not the ""lazy"" stereotype builder, so it's given me a solid work ethic.why i think you should vote for mei'm not space famous, but i think that's an asset. i'm not busy leading a coalition, or trying to provide guys with content on a plate every time i log in, so i can spend more time focusing on csm activites. my main ambition is to campaign on behalf of, and be the sounding board for, underdog/smaller groups, and promote asymetrical gameplay that allows a handful of people to bloody the nose of bigger dogs.to that end my platform will mainly focus on: assistance for nrds/npsi playstyles capital balance, especially in regards to force auxillaries and carrier gameplay 2.0 faction warfare, and possible changes w-space. i'm not a wormholer currently, but i do want to be a supportive voice for those that do live there. any further balance passes on logistics/ewar promotion of live events and lore, possible outsourcing of more stuff to player communities (akin to the amarr unity event.) rebuilding/improving the ccp <> csm <> eve player bondsoutside of this, i will attempt to put input where i have sufficient knowledge. i can't fix things with a magic wand, but i can be someone who passes ideas/complaints along, as well as give an honest opinion. if i see something ccp presents as not ideal. i won't be afraid to straight up say so, and explain why. if given the chance, i would like to be your sounding board.thanks for reading this wall of text, and good luck to all the fellow candidates.utari onzoutarionzo@gmail.comyou can see all my interviews here: csmwatch and csmwatch analysis 5eve guardianeve-ntdeclarations of war csm roundtable.you can also keep up with the provibloc blog that i write for here.""face the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it, the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it, burn away his evil"""

1/12/2016,"hey sorry just saw this now.1. i think you entice people out by making fights more available simply by having them become more plentiful. that's kind of the number 1 issue in the game right now in all sectors of space, and there are some very real reasons for it. i joined right into the large scale pvp side of the game as i said by joining test on day 2 of playing, but for most well known and respected fcs/alliance folks/etc there background story almost always starts with ""so i was flying a drake in high sec and then ..."". i'm sure there are huge number of folks carebearing away exactly like that in massive null blocks, never really being exposed to fleet fights or pvp in general in an engaging way. obviously it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea and some enjoy what they enjoy, but i do think they're the minority. all it takes is that one experience to make it click. the current advice of ""go lose 20 frigates in fw"" sounds good on paper, but even just the logistics of that, where do you get the isk, how do i fit them, etc is quite high and it's by no means the only way.2. to be clear i've never really been in a ""biggest fish in the pond"" type group. in bl we were always concerned about pl pre-phoebe. the second we put supers on field, there's a ticking clock until pl comes just like any other group in the game bar the cfc. post-phoebe, i mean, we set up camp right before it 2 mids deep into the middle of their space so yeah we were always the small fish.the mechanics at their core i actually think are okay. fatigue seems like a good idea, range nerfs don't seem like a bad idea, just the combination of the two with the extreme numbers used i think are a problem. the consensus i've found at least in the sphere's of folks i speak to regularly, is reworking caps/supers to have the same 8ly range as blops do currently, removing fatigue from jfs (keep it on non-freighter industrials to prevent titan bridge chaining abuse) and buffing blops to 10ly. i personally feel like giving caps regular non-super caps a 25-50% fatigue reduction on top of that would be a good idea, but i'd want to give those other changes like 3-6 months and see how that plays out first. that's my wishlist on the subject.in terms of increased capital use, eh, i'm skeptical. a lot of the increased use is stupid stuff like using archons to shoot pocos when you can fit up a 100m talos to do 80% the dps for 5% of the cost. what i do think has happened which is good though is a very clear redistribution of r64s to the people who actually live near them. i.e. aridia being owned by lsh in the north and nc in the south instead of bl and pl living 8 regions away and having a permanent cyno chain to get there in 5 minutes if someone tries to hit them.3. as i said in my op, i think the entosis mechanic is all round bad and has to go. you keep the structures, the flow of timers, and the station freeport mechanic exactly as is, but you dps them down exactly as before and use adms to scale the resists of those structures. specific numbers would be a longer and nuanced debate, but ideally i'd aim for having it such that an active corp of ~20 real people wouldn't have any trouble taking an undefended 1x station system, while a max adm staging system would require dreads to rf in a reasonable period of time. my goal is less about specific numbers and outcomes, and more about gauging it such that what you need to field to get the job done is proportional to how important that system. i think that plan i have is the best of both worlds because it still lets groups like yourselves take a couple backend systems if they really want to without increasing the effort involved all that much, but brings back the major isk/effort commitment that catalyses large fights."
1/12/2016,"csm watch interviewvideo ver. coming soon!hello, pilots!uriel ""the dreamy lore guy"" paradisi anteovnuecci here: now's as good a time as ever to announce my run for csm xi! there's a lot i know i plan to bring the table within my area, and i'm happy and eager to represent the part of the eve community i'm involved with.from day 1, i've been hooked on eve; after accidentally clicking an ad on youtube and arriving on eve's website, i decided to look into it. what started as bored exploration turned into many hours of reading background, chronicles, and every short story on the backstory section of the community page. after testing the waters with a few trials, i subscribed, and i've been hooked ever since~<U+266A>uriel's been around for close to three years now, and i've been playing eve for about 3 and-a-half. in that time, i've become deeply involved with the game's lore, rp, and live event crowds. i've worked with many players to uncover secrets, craft plausible theories, and explore things on sisi far before they hit tq in some cases. most recently, i've been participating in events surrounding the drifters, from caroline's star (which we just found out a whole lot more about), to the antikythera element and entosis link, to their effect on the jove observatories and the consequently obtained observational logs(scope feat. uriel~), the first explorations of the drifter hive complexes (finding dr. tukoss's body as well), and the events leading up to jamyl sarum's in-world death (and the first rounds of the amarr championships following that). beyond that, i've participated in just about every live event that's happened since i've started playing, and i've apparently become known as a walking encyclopedia for just about anything lore-related, and anything at all concerning the jove. it's certainly a nice feeling when people come to you for help; and it's always felt great to help anyone interested on their way to finding a good experience in the game. i've had an insanely good time in eve so far, and i'd like to do all i can to help others enjoy it just as much, through the csm.- involvements less specifically, i support increasing possibilities for players to make their eve experience their own through customization; discussing skin price points, adding more options, better ""designer"" skins, and working towards customization, alliance skins and logos appearing on ships, and more unique designs are all things i hope to address. in addition, i hope to facilitate better communication and transparency between playerscsmccp, and create a more accessible and effective means of suggesting features and ideas for the game than the forum provides at this time.i've had an amazing time in eve thus far, and i hope to continue doing so, while doing all i can to let others do the same. as a highly involved player, irl game major and potential csm member, i plan to help ccp continue to improve eve and continue building its unique world, while ensuring that it remains the game we all play and love. thanks for your consideration: i hope you'll select me to represent you on the csm /urielcontact via eve mail, in channel ""uriel4csm""twitter: @anteovnueccireddit: /u/nickosaurusemail: urianteo3@gmail.com"

1/13/2016,"a challenge with wis is finding an emote system that makes the environment visually alive and interesting, and gives the freedom to express and show what you want, also for places where capsuleers can be without suits, which i hope that there will be if there is a wis expansion.one should not necessarily try to achieve emotes for expressions, as for expression emotes a different system maybe with text can be used that can replace them. also, action emotes for actions that doesn<U+FFFD>t directly influence the gameplay, can be replaced by this system. the reason i think emotes for expressions, and those actions that doesn't directly influence the gameplay, should be handled by a text system, are that they are so personal that making an emote for them actually hinders interaction. even if you have many to choose from one can feel forced to use an emote just because it<U+FFFD>s the closest one to what you want to show or express, even if it isn<U+FFFD>t that close. and even if it is what you are looking for, it doesn<U+FFFD>t have subtleties from person to person. therefore i find it very difficult to interact meaningfully using emotes. writing your own words allows you to describe precisely what you want to express or what you are doing. then it<U+FFFD>s up to the player or players you are interacting with to imagine. i did think of a system where you could use something like the playstation move or those controllers for oculus to record movements and make your own emotes to be used in game, maybe as an addition to the above?"

1/13/2016,"while i agree that people can change, i'm not convinced xenuria has changed enough to actually be a valued and constructive member of the csm. i have the fear that xenuria will do what xenuria does and dwell on trivial issues that nobody other than he cares about and will just **** off ccp due to him refusing to let it go when they say no. his last trivial issue was high heels or something and he abused the ccp staff member on livestream.xenuria absolutely has the passion needed for a csm member but his passion is quite often misdirected to trivial issues and he refuses to accept any questions or criticism instead labelling those people as trolls. i myself have been labelled as a troll by xenuria for asking honest questions about his campaign.edit: apparently ccp are trying to get an e rating for their forums and have censored out some of the most basic of english words."

1/13/2016,"""no clue of the inner workings""you are 100% correct. this is because there is something called an nda or non-disclosure agreement that all members of the csm agree too. this means individuals who are not on the csm are not privy to insider information. it's silly to accuse me or being intentionally vague when i have the same amount of access to information that you or any other player does. i am no a psychic i can't read minds and i don't have a deep cover infiltrator inside ccp. so please, let's be reasonable. this is not a platform about something all players have granular and specific information about. this isn't about wormholes or sov or minning or pve. this is a reform platform which means there are black boxes and unknowns."

1/13/2016,a few questions:what is your opinion of the current state of fleet combat meta? (in nullsec) is it in a good/bad place? whtat is the most serious problem within the game that you think ccp should address in the near future? bonus question: why are nightmares bad vs supercarriers and trackingtitans?
1/13/2016,"i'm in two minds on this really. it's certainly better than it has been in the past, with a lot more mid-scale (30-60~) pvp taking place between fleets in the south that i've been able to join in on. i think the battlecruiser changes were one of main drivers of this, providing a great, cheap platform for fc's to use. in fact, the fact that ishtars absolutely hazed bc's was one of the reasons it was so terrible for the pvp meta, as they and t1 cruisers have always been the kind of 'baseline' for fc's to fly, and making them viable not just in stats, but keeping them so in the meta is important to keeping nullsec pvp ecosystem active, by ensuring that newer fc's have an option that can have a reasonable chance against all non-strategic gangs.on a larger, strategic scale, fleet combat has stagnated a fair bit. whilst we do have the added wildcard of mjd destroyers, tech 3 cruisers and faction battleships simply reign supreme. however, i think the capital changes that are on the horizon have a chance to shake things up by giving us more easily accessible and stronger triage that might make t1 bs doctrines viable (from atleast an isk efficiency point of view) again. it's my firm belief that the most serious problem affecting eve is not one specific feature, nor one specific issue. it's the lack of proper iteration on player facing changes that are made to the game. ideally, balance or feature changes should have a clear and pointed direction, and be reviewed to see what impact they actually had after the meta has had time to settle to determine whether they have been effective or not in achieving their goals.i believe that this isn't just something ccp should be working towards however, it's something the csm is uniquely well suited to help with, being (ideally) active and well connected players who can catch the pulse of the community, and the inevitable work-arounds that any change causes to pop up. presenting an 'on the ground' report to ccp would really go a long way to helping them adjust changes in the direction they want to go, at least in my personal opinionof all the battleships one could bring, the nightmares are honestly one of the best. they have decent ehp, and great sustained speed from the ab bonus. in fact, with their neuts and the incredible dps of pulses, they represent a not insignificant threat to a solo or small group of super capitals, especially if accompanied by triage or dread support. in fact, with boosts, a tracking titan has an incredibly tiny amount of applied damage to the nightmare.however, when said titans are supported by a fleet of lokis & protepodes who are well co-ordinated and able to web and paint the targets, the picture changes immensely, as their combined webs and paints can line the ships up for a one way ticket to the salvage station by utilising their incredible alpha properly.the same applies to supercaps' fighter bombers when tracking fit, though their fighters are designed to be effective sans said support, so with the buffer afforded to them by their hull, can fit tracking mods and have an incredibly significant impact on combat, without risking themselves getting turned on and quickly burned down like a carrier would in the same situation. this means they're less dependant on subcapital support, however they lack the same alpha as a titan, and their weapon systems can be disrupted by the affected subcaps.in short, they do not do well against them if they are being used in a well thought out, co-ordinated and effective manner with sub-capital support to enable them to be used as a force multiplier."

1/13/2016,"i'm sure this thread will only be ravaged by fellow code. bros and the like, so i figured i would take this chance to talk about ganking, as it takes up a large chunk of your platform. a little background on me; i am a ganker, wardeccer, scammer, and former awoxer and make my living as such. i joined eve on a cresting wave of advertising to ""be the villain"" in eve online and blogs from criminals and griefers. having read through a few of your recent blog posts, specifically the one regarding the changes you would like to see for concord, (random spawning times, response times, and greater patrols) i don't agree that these changes would create better conditions for potential victims, rather they would just further complicate operations for gankers. creating ""random within ranges"" of response times and spawning for concord in different security systems just means that i would need to wait a few days until code. bros (you know who you are) tested the ranges into the ground and determined new ranges from which gankers could effectively gank targets. seriously. no matter what changes are made, as long as ccp doesn't take away our red button we will find a way to gank efficiently. as for patrols, i'm still unclear on their effectiveness considering that most gankers don't usually do much ganking within 15 minutes of their previous ganking. keep in mind that concord serves the purpose of reactively punishing criminal activity. you compare concord to the police, but its purpose is to punish, not save lives. in short, i think you want to punish gankers because you see them as a group that has effectively broken the system, and currently don't have a hard counter. i'm sure you're going to find some support for your initiative, but i don't forsee ccp making these changes. i talked to the ""greatly despicable"" mike azariah a few months ago about the highsec criminal community in the wake of the news of hyperdunking getting axed by ccp. the one thing that stuck with me was him telling me that ganking was something that ccp actually supports as content because it serves a reminder that you are never safe in eve. it's just a little something that keeps my cold heart pumping, as i hold ganking dear as one of the few pillars of highsec piracy.i think it was best put by floppiethebanjoclown in his recent post regarding good guys in highsec:so why not promote ideas for making highsec more fun by creating new opportunities, careers, and above all else content! what happened to bounty hunters and an actual functional bounty system? how about player integration and roles in empire space or even concord? i understand that the whole election promises business is kind of a farce for the csm, but at the same time members are still giving an input on the development of the game and future plans, so no reason to shy away from making suggestions.good luck, but you don't have my vote."

1/13/2016,"if you are unable to distinguish or see the finer issues and subtle differences within a coalition like the cfc/imperium, then you are showing a clear lack of political maturity, which would in my opinion lead to questions in your own csm thread, not mine.to assume that all, if any, alliance agrees with everything done within the coalition or that particular alliances are on the same level or wave length of other alliances you are totally and completely wrong. to then accuse me of being out of touch with the political and mechanical nuances of nullsec is absurd. my candidacy for csm is partly motivated because i do understand the differences in culture and goals between the entities within a large coalition. shouting from the outside pointing the finger underlines a lack of political maturity. or dare i say it proves that you in particular are powerless to change the thing you claim to oppose.if your argument is ""grr gons, hat gons"", i would point you towards a condi candidates thread. if your goal is to go into every candidates thread to character assassinate them, i would say people can make up their own minds on who they would like to represent them. i, for one, stand as a nullsec candidate, not a cfc one. co2 has historically and culturally, and don't take my word for it, please have some frank conversations with people who can know, a different identity."

1/13/2016,"there are quite a few viable battleship doctrines out there. as everything in eve it highly depends on the situation and the users intention. machariels are only one of many frequently used battleship doctrines atm.buffing/adjusting a single ship class because you ""want to see more of them or they should be forces to be reconed with"" isnt really a thing in eve and leads to imbalances in power in a very hard to balance environment.what would you want to change? and why? pretty sure ccp is aware of that since forever but since alliances are corporations of corporations this is really hard to implement. this is not really anything you as csm could change or affect. when multiple fleets work together they usually have some sort of communcation link setup already. this change would only amplify n+1 gameplay which nobody really wants to see. this was part of jayne fillons platform last year, and even tho ccp mentioned that they have plans in regards to this topic they clearly couldnt devote any resources to it. the point about temporary standings is not a big issue for most fleets since:1. people usually shoot what a targetcaller/fc broadcasts.2. fcs/targetcallers can already set standings towards other entities.3. distinguishing different fleets is not an impossible task (and shouldnt be for an aspiring fc)4. fcs usually coordinate with each other already.how would this change (which is probably a lot of effort to implement) affect the day to day buisness in npsi fleets and why should ccp devote resources to this?

1/13/2016,"hello friends of new eden! i am widget zombie, i have been playing eve online for almost 4 years. i have watched various csm campaigns happen and i confess it got me more interested in the game. my play style has revolved around the players and the communities that are built inside of eve. over the last few years, i have played the general role of diplomat, starting at a corporation level leading to being the head diplomat for one of the larger alliances in the game. i have been involved with my alliance community for 2 years and my personal community for 4 years. i have met a lot of eve players in rl, including hugging many of you at eve vegas 2015. as much as the game mechanics are an important aspect in the game, the people are more important. it's the people that keep the game going. it's the people that truly help make changes with how the game runs and is played. ladies and gentleman, i want to be the voice of change, the voice of reason. as a potential member of csm, i will make myself publicly available to yield your comments and concerns. i will them turn them into the issues i will bring to the table.topics of interest: structures and their use in highsec, lowsec, nullsec, and wormhole space - over the next year or so the new structures will be coming to the game, it<U+FFFD>s important to know about the changes and how they affect everyone in the game. questions range from how will citadels, or other structures, affect the high security lifestyle to those who live in wormholes and the building/moving/anchoring process. the interest of this topic embraces 100% of the player base. there is no getting around it. the future of entosis mechanics - i am not saying that they are perfect or broken, however the theory behind the entosis modules was an interesting idea. will the proposed changes to the module affect anyone who uses them in a positive or negative light? we won<U+FFFD>t truthfully know until that time comes. team building - i am apart of the second largest alliance in eve at the moment. over the past 2 years i have been apart of the building and expanding of a rather incredible alliance. i want to take my team building skills with me to the csm to enhance the potential output for the upcoming year. in the future i would be open to assisting alliances/corporations with team building assistance. capitals - does it have a jump drive? count me in. on a much personal level, i used to the to love sub capitals, then one day i flew a carrier. it was my world. then as i proceeded to fill my cranium with other skill books relating to being able to jump farther, conserve jump fuel and engage faster; i realized my true calling to the game was the capitals. today capitals are rarely used for fleet engagements, but more often than not used for pve. capitals were made for multifunction use, hauling things, increased effective hit points and higher dps; this rotation of unbalanced-ness needs diminished. i am excited about +6 types of doomsday coming soon. i am unexcited about being able to get tackled by a frigate. let's get capitals on the same page for once and get new changes to roll out in unison with all races. new player engagement - when huge environment changes happen in any game, you tend to see huge spikes of members renewing subscriptions or people finding an interest in signing up to play the game. in recent years of recruiting i have found that several new players to the game are often lost and confused or they got recruited to a corporation that offered little to no assistance in getting them properly trained. aura is a great tool and it walks anyone through the entirety of the game. new player <U+FFFD>help channels<U+FFFD> are convenient but often now players can<U+FFFD>t find them. language barrier, there should be a setting to assist with translation and allow multiple language sets to play within the same corporation/alliance as they want to work towards the same goals. new players need to be set up to succeed or else they will leave the game and never come back. thank you for reading my post, i am very excited to be applying to csm xi and hope to be representing you!"

1/14/2016,i was using it humorously.
1/14/2016,"hi! good luck in your campaign as well!more than you would think actually, as i have lots to move around. it works pretty much the same as most things in this game where the antagonist party basically just has to find some one who gets careless or makes a mistake, leaving an opening for a gank. there's a reason why red and black frog don't complain about code.; the same reason extreme nullbears don't really get caught much; they know how to mitigate the risks associated with their profession and they know that the only kills antagonists get are the ones given to them. use scouts, use webbing alts, pay attention, fit a tank, one or more of these will deny any chance of a gank happening. honestly it's bad game play as there is no real back and forth; the antagonist is entirely reactive, waiting for a chance to strike.you want the game, and its players, to be able to sort out the good behaviors from the bad ones, rewarding the good, punishing the bad. it's honestly one of the few things that make the game unique. considering a skillful and careful player can maintain extremely high levels of safety, i don't think concord needs a buff or a change. you do not want to make it too hard to gank in high sec, nor too easy to remain safe. if anything i personally feel its too tilted towards the latter at the moment, but i am willing to hear it from both sides. i haven't ganked in hs in a long time, but at least from the antagonist side here, some people refused to be caught, while others simply let it happen - safety is a personal responsibility in this game, mechanics that do it for you removes part of what makes eve, eve. basically, its already to the point where you can be practically untouchable in hs, in my appraisal.high sec is as safe as its players are informed.yes, i understand what the csm does and is for. i would invite you to stop by my thread."
1/14/2016,"i know. i also know that concord are not there to save the gankee from the ganker. but having them turn up after exactly the same time and then just sit around strikes a nerve. i did not meant to imply ""patrol"" as in concord are flying around the system looking for troublemakers... i meant it in a more abstract way. surely those brave concord ships have better things to do than spend the rest of the day sitting around in the asteroid belts. by having them fly off to do other things and getting rid of the pre-pulling / concord manipulation mechanic was meant to make things simpler for all involved. and i do not have to sit in a belt with 1 concord patrol present and see them watch and do nothing whilst the second catalyst ganks me.at fanfest last year ccp announced that ganking actually might help with player retention. however obscure that might seem to be, if ccp themselves said it... it must have a basis in fact. i am not trying to advocate getting ganking abolished, because i know that will never happen. i would like to see the mechanics being different. i thought about mentioning things like bounties and wardecs in my opening post - but unfortunately i myself don't have any direct ideas on how to make them better. whilst there is work going on with wardecs amongst the player community, i have yet to hear of anything that would make bounty hunting an acceptable or workable calling. i am trying to keep myself away from election promises (apart from that pink ships thing). if i do get elected i will be trying to represent the interests of high sec. ccp has more than once stated unequivocally that high sec ganking and bumping are here to stay - so it would be an obvious and outright lie and betrayal of voter trust for me to say ""i will try to end ganking"". the pirate community (as you say) is well organised and have managed to deal with every ""nerf"" that has until now been thrust upon them. i just personally think that things should be a little different..."

1/14/2016,"vic,you post to quote ""grrgoons"" as part of your candidacy. you have stated on multiple csm threads how you feel rather verbally going as far as calling goons and the imperium more or less a conspiracy. i will not argue sov warfare has slowed however goons and imperium are not the only entity held accountable for this. to my knowledge there are plenty other entities in other areas of sov holding space that are likewise in coalitions that are just as stagnant.you seem to press goons as one of your sub topics yet have voiced about them the most in of your posts outside your initial posts on them have been about the imperium. you make little to no account for fozzie sov and make of that what you will since the release of almost all major warfare has stopped and all expansions as well or any kind of warfare in the respect of sov grabs. since fozzie release there has been little need for it and defending it has been an annoyance to say the least. with all that said far be it for me to say your entire campaign seems entirely biased on nothing but the self destruction f the goons let me say again there are other coalitions that are running with just as many blues with just as much space.to say that the goons are the only 'bad' group that could be detrimental to the health of eve online is so insanely biased and absurd. in another thread you recommended co2 to more or less depart the imperium lest we be unable to speak from a 'culturally acceptable level'.so let me ask you this. would you prefer the goons and only [as you have failed to list the other coalitions] the goons to disband under the circumstances that it is hurting eves health as a sandbox where they players make their own choice and do what they will third party or not (rules and regulations aside)? or be forced to disband as part of your candidacy is ""grrgoons"" which i assume you would plan to 'fix' or change in someway ?"
1/14/2016,"there was a dream that was content ring once. an area geographically favored to become the content cauldron that aegissov promised. then the goons came, and the dream turned into an endless nightmare of empty systems. sure some areas may be stagnant, but its another thing actively enforce it.i have made account of fozziesov. i would suggest reading what i wrote about the two dissonant entry bars, as this goes through, in some depth, about how even though the mechanics have changed, social structures have not. if you want warfare, find people who are also interested in that part of the game. the imperium is not interested in that part of the game. maybe its members are, but it is not. a much more scary, exciting world is out there in new eden, but you have to want it bad enough to take risks, and there are no risks for member alliances of the imperium.you could all be swell, upstanding people, but i'd never know it since you spend all your time bending knee to the imperium. goons have such a huge super majority of players that you cannot compare them to other coalitions; its not about how much space someone has, but how much of the player base they have locked up. true, it's a sandbox, play however you find enjoyment and laughs. no matter what mechanics they implement, if they are even half sane, if so many of the players are locked into a situation where they cannot shoot at each other, they won't; mechanics alone cannot create content. waiting for one feature to deliver you content is just silly; aegissov may not be the best, but its daft to demonize it and blame all the game's ills on it - the game's ills are in large part player made, and there is no magic game mechanic bullet to magically create large scale wars when the powers that be do not want it. if ccp is interested in making the game a more interesting place, they should foster smaller alliances, as all the keys to newbies right now are in large part owned by large blocs."

1/14/2016,"i am not sure how much more explicit i need to be here. the only value you have to the cfc is as a vassal state, and when this is done this at the expense of potential content for players and alliances in exchange for safety, when trading content for safety is tolerated by alliance members as acceptable behavior, it speaks volumes about what those members actually value. it's painfully obvious that member states value ratting and srp far more than getting the content they moan you cannot get because of aegissov. content ring was a thing for a good few months, let me remind you how well the cfc tolerated that. honestly ph could have had a nice sporty war with one of the vassal states of equivalent size, but instead it was the prerogative of the cfc to just overwhelm them. yes, maybe the system isn't the best, nothing is perfect, it could use some work. however, in the case of the imperium, it doesn't matter what system is in place, what mechanics are in the game, they will always pick the most boring one that ensures security. eve was fresh, new, inventive, and exciting when things were allowed to happen in game, but the social structures that be prevent most of this. as a member of the imperium, you are associated with this behavior, or you tacitly agree with it by the nature of being in a coalition whose modus operandi was and still is weaponized boredom. which is why i do not find your pseudo claims of having different values than your host coalition credulous; if you had different values, why be blue to them, given them players to wage conquest and defense with? either you are very conflicted, or you are, at the end of the day, very content being a pawn to the greater cfc so long as you can rat and get srp."

1/14/2016,"thank you for your kind endorsements. i want an eve revival. there's been a steady decline in numbers, let's be honest. game changing patches have lost many in our community. i say we roll back to the pre-retribution patch as it hurt the numbers greatly, and hurt our game that we love.if you haven't been playing eve that long, it was the suspect timer patch. admittedly, everyone has gotten used to it, but it was a better experience.have a wonderful day.killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
1/14/2016,"i am argoni brinalle one of the directors of the red frog freight alliance. in addition to hauling for the three divisions of our alliance i actively manage over 200 freighter pilots and 30 jump freighter pilots throughout high, low, and null. in the past i have also run incursions, mined, and have pvp<U+FFFD>d in all regions of space with various corps and alliances in addition to learning what changes are expected by service and industry focused players, i would like to see work done to make improvements in the following areas.contract systemthe courier contract system is old. on a basic level it does work but there is a lot of improvements that are long overdue. a lot of very good suggestions where given back in april when ccp asked for feedback. since then nothing has been done or any suggestions that ccp is planning on working on it. to help clarify going forward all hauling corps and most alliance and bloc hauling is done on out of corp characters to avoid wardecs. this forces us to use one character the (ca) to accept a courier contract and another character the (fa) to haul the contract. a) currently you can<U+FFFD>t see what is inside of a courier contract like you can with an item exchange. being able to see the contents after you accept the contract eliminate secrecy as a reason for this a) proposal: have courier contracts show the contents before the contract is accepted.b) containers: currently the contract system doesn<U+FFFD>t allow item exchange contracts to be created if there is a container inside of a courier package. this forces in station trading of the contract which necessitates the ca to fly out to the station. once at the station the ca direct trades with the fa. this also necessitates two separate active accounts. a) proposal: either allow item exchange contracts for courier contracts with a container in them or show a flag like cargo size that denotes the existence of a container in a container. c) stack size: to go along with the containers change a lot of containers are used in courier contract to bypass the 200 item stack size limit. a) proposal: if there must be a limit increase it to something much higher or ideally remove the limit all together and let storage size be the limiting factor.d) contract auto rejection: currently freight corporations must manually check the courier contracts issued to them to ensure that the size, collateral, expirations are correct. a) proposal: allow corporations to set maximum and minimum values for courier contracts to be issued to the corporation. if the contract doesn<U+FFFD>t match the allowed values then the contract is auto rejected and the issuer is told why the contract failed to be issued. further down the road maybe even allow corporations to set restrictions on security status serviced or systems not delivered to. e) quality of life setting up contracts: currently there are 5 screens you must click through before you can issue a contract. a) proposal: condense the contract screen to a items and rewards screen and a confirm screen. easy quality of life improvementthe proposals listed above are the changes i see as critical to the improvement of the contract system. there are further changes i would like to see made and would like to hear any further ideas you have as well.chat managementcurrently the management of a large intel or multi corp <U+FFFD> multi alliance channel is to be blunt a major headache. as an example red frog freight maintains two such channels, one for red frog and one for black frog. in these channels we have our relevant corps added as well as over 700 individual characters. a) ability to search inside of the access listb) ability to see if the character is in the corp or alliance without having to manually personal standingsc) auto trim: once a character or corp is added that entry stays in the channel list until removed. overtime this leads to a lot of inactive characters that are no actually using the channel. a) proposal: allow channel admins to have an option to auto remove the character is after a certain amount of time the character hasn<U+FFFD>t joined the channel"
1/14/2016,"igb changesnot much to say here. ccp announced that they would like to remove the igb. i agree something needs to be done with as it is super outdated and requires special design or websites just to allow its use. but the igb is widely used in all manner of in game tasks. we need to ensure that before the igb is removed all parties using it have the ability to replace the task in some way. as an example for red frog we use the igb to monitor, accept, and reject all contracts. if the igb were to be removed today we would be force to return to the default contract finder which doesn<U+FFFD>t have a lot of the super specific functionality we enjoy. ccp is doing a great job on this front with the crest api additions that have been added as well as the eve auth functionality.gankingyes i know the hs carebear is going to complain about ganking<U+FFFD> well not really. i think ganking has its place in eve and in high sec. honestly without it hauling service corps wouldn<U+FFFD>t be in business except to serve the super lazy. not being safe in eve ever unless you are docked in an npc station is what makes eve, well, eve. i think as we look at the ability to gank vs the ability to avoid the gank is in a decent spot for all but the freighter class. all other ship types allowed in hs have the ability to counter the bumping mechanics that freighters fall prey to. a freighter on the other hand once bumped is a sitting duck. there is one way to avoid getting bumped in a freighter, external webbing (if your webber its self isn<U+FFFD>t ganked first). this is the one area that needs addressing. tbh no other single relationship in eve is so one dimensional. the breakdown that allows this i believe is the ability to continuously bump without repercussion. i would like to hear ideas that don<U+FFFD>t break the ganking gameplay itself but do help bring the freighter part inline.proposal: make bumping of a ship outside of 100km? of a gate, or station grant a criminal tag after a certain amount of bumps on a single ship in a certain time period. corp historycurrently your time in corp is set to count the time since you last joined to the present day. will this is an alright count of corp senority a better way i think would be to count total time in the current corp for all stays in corp. maybe have two lines in the character profile, one for time of current stay and one for total time in history. this would allow players to more easily recognize members of a corp with extensive history without having to manually search through corp history.bookmark systemalliance bookmarks: the increase in allowed number of corp bookmarks has helped. thank you ccp for that. but we need to go one step further and address a quality of life issue that affect mostly wh alliances. because the path to go somewhere is constantly changing corps are constantly copying their bookmarks and dropping them in space for other corps in the alliance. why do we need this extra step to achieve what could be done by implementing alliance bookmarks. rights to edit the bookmarks would be tricky since how do you assign rights to edit alliance wide. i think a good place to start would be expand the role that allows you to delete bookmarks from corp to be allowed to also copy to and remove from alliance bookmarks."
1/14/2016,a shade vague.changes in what direction?m
1/15/2016,"please discuss with ccp the possibility of increasing the speed of this game, it's too slow.too much time is spent and wasted, warping around from system to system at sub 10 au.i propose ccp increase au warp speed by a factor of 10, ex. your standard cruiser would warp at 13au, not 3.i've been playing since 2005 and even with the implementation of the latest warp speed increase modules and ascendancy implants, warp speed is still far to slow.this increase would be a big incentive to new players as well, when they are informed that it no longer takes forever to get anywhere.what do you think?"

1/15/2016,"this is actually a very good point, hope you make it up to iceland so you can at least get this across to them."
1/15/2016,"thanks for the question apex. i'm open to any and all, and do enjoy putting my thoughts into writing, no matter how hypothetical a scenario is required for those thoughts to become realised.i've been getting a few private mails asking about how i thought the small battlecruiser rebalance went, so i decided to answer in a slightly different format, and published an article on the what i felt a battlecruisers role was within eve, and how these changes affected them.i'll probably write out answers to a few more questions in this long form if there are ones that i can really go deep on in terms of analysing them."
1/15/2016,"sorry, perhaps this is just me but i cannot seem to find your proposed changes to concord on your blog. could you provide a link or a summary here?but as to your point and has been pointed out above, you already have a better than 50% chance of ""getting away"" from a gank. way more than 50% of the targets i consider ganking escape unscathed either because further investigation reveals they are too tanked, paying too much attention, a miscalculation on my part, or by just dumb luck warping away at the last minute. i would even venture to say anyone who knows what they are doing and spends a small amount of effort can avoid over 99% of all highsec ganks. i am thinking though you mean to make the criminal highsec pvp encounters themselves less binary. i think such a thing is possible while keeping risk in highsec so i am curious about what ideas you might have. as to risk, what is your current view on the risk vs. reward balance of highsec? do you think the income levels possible in highsec are suitable for the current level of risk? if so, do you think this has any consequences for the game as a whole that you are concerned about?"

1/15/2016,"isn't the csm supposed to be none biased, built to improve the game through player feed back. so vic, you seem very biased against the cfc, which, are they not called the imperium now. it seems you are using the csm elections as a way to spread propaganda about your reds rather than staying none biased. as such, why should i vote for you instead of someone else that has stuck to the issues and not taken the time to bad mouth other entities in game?"
1/15/2016,"there is a healthy amount of grrr goons in my posting, but there are lots of other very topics that i cover that are only tangential at best to it. while you are free to call me whatever you want so long as the moderators do not get involved, i would kindly ask you to center on the issues, opinions, or perspectives i have posted here, which cover many aspects of the game.i surmise that everyone went through a phase as a kid where you liked dinosaurs. i mean how could you not, they were huge and had big teeth, and didn't take smack from puny small mammals. when we had huge tyrant coalitions, unlike dinosaurs, they didn't vie for dominance through brutal contests of strength; they turned blue. now, between phobe and aegissov, that was supposed to be the proverbial meteor that wipes out the big ticket sov blocs, 'dinosaurs', if you will. thing is, it didn't. we are supposed to be in an age when there is competition between rapidly evolving smaller alliances, each clawing, gnashing, and fighting for their own chunk of sov, but the culture of big ticket sov is still dominant, and we have seen what that culture does to conflict, namely, eliminates it.as i have written about in other posts, a lot of what has prevented this is that established blocs have all the out of game resources to make things work, whereas new entities have to do all of this in one step to compete, which is exceptionally difficult to do. when dinosaurs were wiped out, evolution ran riot with the clean slate of a world to work with, whereas here, not all that much changed. the central theme of my campaign is that if you want new eden to feel 'new', if you want to engage newer players with content they can personally get involved with and feel an attachment to the game and have fun with, then you have to give players a smoother incline and more choices of how to start that journey. right now the choices are leveling a raven or joining a big ticket null bloc."

1/15/2016,"that's just poetic bullshit. there's a world of difference between the two, anyone that's ever been in a combat role/fleet will tell you that.ganking doesnt require skills, just greater numbers. pvp is 1 on 1(+), it requires tactical skill as well as the time taken to train skills. the only similarity, is that pvp and ganking both involve capsuleers.anyway, i digress; i can't think of anyone better to run for a csm position than foo. his knowledge of the eve universe far exceeds that of anyone i have met/spoken to during my brief time here.most people can and will tell you what to do, why you should do it and how best to do it. from the many killboards, to the forums, to the blogposts; everyone has an opinion on what's best. foo doesn't just do that, he goes further. he listens to what it is that you are trying to achieve and then explains what it is you need to do to achieve the results you are looking for. he has an answer to the question you havent even figured out you need to ask.in my humble opinion that is a great quality, a great skill. listening to people and then helping them achieve their goals, efficiently. isn't that what someone on any kind of council should do?listen to you and liaise with governing bodies."
1/15/2016,"fellow capsuleers o/my name is vic, and i need your help to fix the csm before we lose our voice forever.about mei've been playing eve since 2009, and have done so solo, in a small group, and as part of a large alliance. i have learned how to lead and how to follow. my adventures have taken me from humble hisec beginnings through to null, wh space and back again multiple times. i have pve'd, pvp'd, mined, researched, hauled, manufactured and traded. i believe i have a pretty good grasp of the concept of eve as a whole, and i am passionate about every aspect of gameplay and lore. i love the entire eve package; there is simply nothing else like it.irl i am ex-military, and currently a business owner, so i've done grunt work, and also steered the ship. i am a pragmatist at heart, with a low tolerance for ego and celebrity, but balance it out with a personable attitude and laid-back nature. dedicated autz player, fanfest pilgrim, edu attendee (you're next, eve vegas), bourbon enthusiast, sci-fi fan, metal/ambient/edm listener and student of history.my csm role collaboration - the csm can not afford another bad term if it doesn't want to be seen as a complete joke. we need to stick to the very serious task of being a voice for the community and sounding board for the devs, but at the same time realise that we must work with ccp to improve the eve experience. our overarching goal should always be the continuation and growth of eve, not competing against each other to try and steer it. i aim to use my position to reinforce this view and create a more positive, collaborative culture. it's concerning that this point is mostly mentioned last in other platforms, when it is, at the moment, the most critical. perspective - many potential csm members are representing certain parts of new eden (null, hisec etc) or are building their platforms around certain balance changes or upcoming content. instead of the 'production line' view of players moving from hisec -> losec/fw -> null/whs etc, or the view that 'everything should be done towards the end goal of pvp', i personally view all of eve as an organism made of symbiotic parts; each has their intrinsic value and place, none is above or 'better' than the other, and each is attractive to a certain type of player and style of play, from the basement-dwelling nullsec overlord to the married-with-kids hisec industrialist. we need to take into account the factors affecting the enjoyment of all these different people to keep eve balanced and healthy. as a csm member, i will do my best to collate and find balance in the multitude of specialist views so the maximum number of people can find enjoyment, and new subscriptions are constant, because eve will appeal to more people instead of catering for the interests of a particularly vocal portion. realism - ccp is a business at the end of the day, which will affect their decisions. some things take time to change and implement in a game with over a decade of history and complexity. the maxim of it being infinitely better to take small steps, and fix the foundations before you build another storey is as true for eve as for anything in the real world. new eden is a 'dark science fiction' universe; the lore and feel of the game should reflect this. the game is about fun/hr, not isk/hr. it is a social game. my aim as part of the csm is to check each concept and implementation against these ideas and more, as they come to light, to ensure a grounded and consistent approach to the eve development cycle. in conclusioni don't care about being an internet celebrity. i don't care about agendas and i am not 'the delegate for xyz...'. i am in this for the bigger picture. i am in this for the survival of eve. this year, i have sufficient time and effort available to truly dedicate myself to a term on the csm. if you want a member who has gone from years of quiet observation and experience, to deciding to make a difference to a critical part of the ccp-playerbase relationship, then help me make that difference by talking with your vote during the yc118 csm xi elections.a vote for vic is a vote for eve, and if you don't vote for eve......can i have your stuff?o7feel free to post questions in this thread, if you have any."

1/15/2016,"not so sure on this. for example, a neut in local will send the vast majority of ratters to their station, a pos, or a safe. it is extremely one dimensional.you do have other options here you aren't discussing. for example, you can scout the gate to check for people who would gank your webs, or you could use a webbing ship that is harder to gank or use multiple webbing ships, thus making you more unattractive to gank as there are easier targets. you could even gank the bumping ship, or bump it back. when you realize that groups that do lots of freighter ganking are very organized, and require many characters each doing a very specialized job, they should have countermeasures they can take for the preventative measures you take. as it is, webbing alts are already extremely powerful; your one extra hand can already mitigate the efforts of many ganking characters; two or three could suitably stall a ganking fleet onto a different target. i think your proposal of ship bumps +100km from gate needs some work. this negates the possibility of counter-bumping by making it criminal, and could also get a lot of people concord'ed for just flying normally. i can see where hi sec generally needs better criminal mechanics, as the antagonists have no skin in the game at any time, and can wait indefinitely until someone makes a mistake which is punishable. there is no way to take the fight to the antagonists, which is just strange that all the onus of remaining vigilant lays on the freighters and miners.it's great that, as you point out, shipping services largely exist due to the risks involved, i.e. contract your stuff the specialists who are used to being good at moving stuff so it does arrive safely, making it a rewarding and valuable profession. the riskier a profession is, the more the game and its players sort out the good players from the bad, and the more profitable it can become to those who devote the resources to become good at it."
1/15/2016,"like you said criminal mechanics does need work. how do we make criminal mechanics more dynamic and interesting without breaking ganking as a part of eve. how do we help the target of the gank stand a chance without making the ganker have no chance. how do we balance the cost of ganking a mostly empty ship be much closer to the cost of the ship being ganked. honestly i have no good idea for that right now but i think the discussion needs to happen. like i said ganking sub freighter is in a decent place, but once you start looking at freighters i know a couple things need to change.1) cost of a single ganking catalyst is 2-3mil. cost of a ganking fleet of catalysts is sub 100mil. compare this to the 1.25bil cost of a totally empty freighter. lets use red frog's operating guideline of only carrying up to 1bil in cargo, which is honestly not a lot of isk in the big picture. this makes the cost of the freighter 2.25bil that can be without risk ganked by sub 100mil. do i think the player numbers it takes to down a freighter needs to increase? no! but the isk value being risked needs to move closer the haul value. 2) the ability of a single mach to prevent a freighter from warping for an indefinite period of time with very little risk needs to change. do i have a problem with the mach being able to prevent a frighter from warping? no not really. but i do think that there needs to be a mechanic in place that forces the ganking party to act ""quickly"" or allow the freighter to pass. i have watched freighters bumped for a good hour + with no attempt at ganking it. that is broken."
1/15/2016,"naw. it's good as it is. you do not want to raise the bar too high for ganking. if you really want a huge disparity, look a the people that use thrashers to gank auto-piloting pods: 5m for a chance at a multi-billion isk killmail. effort and organizational manpower factor into this equation as well, so i am 100% ok with very cheap things en-masse overwhelming very expensive things. i don't really? if you had one counter bumper you could deal with the bumping. it's pretty symmetrical. the bumper is at risk the entire time if you had a ganking fleet of your own."
1/15/2016,i don't really? if you had one counter bumper you could deal with the bumping. it's pretty symmetrical. the bumper is at risk the entire time if you had a ganking fleet of your own. [/quote]i would argue that those interested in ganking the mach are already on the side of the mach. if i want to gank i don't go looking for gankers to gank i side with the gankers. so really the mach is at little to no risk in this equation.
1/15/2016,"really? doesn't the organization whose freighter is being bumped have a strong incentive to gank the bumper to save their associate? i mean capitals get tackled (and even bump-tackled) all over new eden leading to frantic calls for assistance and often escalation. why is it only highsec freighter pilots who seem to feel game mechanics should save their capital ship from an opponent once a pvp engagement has begun?clearly bumping is not the greatest mechanic, and one can imagine alternative interdiction mechanics for capital ships in highsec, but do you agree that whatever hypothetical changes are made to the mechanic should preserve, and even increase the chance for escalation of fights? if so, do you have any preferred ideas on how to do so, something better than the solo-get-out-of-pvp-free mechanic you just proposed above?"
1/15/2016,"organizational strength is a big part of eve online. why doesn't red frog hire professional counter-bumpers? surely it is of the size and strength that hiring professional white knights isn't unreasonable?gankers take time to set up, organize, stay supplied, and to fill every role to make a gank successful. you should have to put in some effort to counter an entire fleet's effort in order to stay safe. there are plenty of white knight types, but as far as i know, they are poorly coordinated and even less organized; emergent gameplay's solution would be to fix this problem before the mechanics do it by themselves. the side that is more organized quite frankly deserves to succeed, where the less organized side deserves to lose.basically, the more mechanics do to protect people, the less player involvement is required. player involvement and identity is the literal lifeblood of this game. i don't think the mechanics are unbalanced here at all, rather that they remain under utilized and under exploited by one side. i remember one time where our freighter was being bumped in high sec. he was auto-piloting and deserved to be in the situation he got himself into. a certain infamous high sec antagonist whom we were blue to at the time literally counter bumped our freighter into warp before it was ganked, effectively rescuing it. i think this just shows you how one side has done more homework than the other - learning these tricks and effectively integrating them into an organization works, and is much healthier for fostering actual game play than heavy handed mechanics changes. it is possible to rescue a freighter if you have the tools on hand - you should not expect to counter the efforts of an entire fleet alone though. mechanics rescuing that freighter would have made that incident any other game, but having one of the most prolific gankers save a freighter? that wasn't just a game, that was eve."
1/15/2016,"personally, i would like to see re-wardec timers for miners so if the surrender in a war, they can't be re-dec'ed the next week by that same alliance/corp. it would help with the high-sec mining/trade groups. if a 1 or 2 week immunity period would not be possible, then a higher fee to be re-dec'ed by that entity would be something to consider."
1/15/2016,"ok, nerf wardecs it is. what else do you got? any thoughts on mining as a mechanic or changes your would like to see for suicide ganking?"
1/15/2016,"o7 melodee everheart,i really want to apologize for not responding sooner to your questions. i've been having some rl issues.i am new in regards to the disabled player community. i see myself being an advocate to disabled players by working with joffy and erika and others to bring the issues disabled players have to ccp. i don't see myself running against joffy and erika, i'd like to see each of us get onto csm xi and work together for the good of the community.personally, i think we need to show a little more focus in bringing the issues we care about to ccp's attention and have them respond to the community and set out to make changes in accessibility."

1/16/2016,"sorry to you, pal. the corp that the ceo created back in 200-whenever is still the property of that ceo, now and forever, until the end of time and/or until when ccp says differently - not some bitter johnny-come-lately who just wants a 'cool' name to use.perhaps these new subscribers should be a little bit more imaginative themselves, rather than attempting to ride the coattails of those who have come before.ridiculous idea, not supported in the least (and your attitude certainly doesn't help), and i'd crumple this idea up, throw it in a wastepaper bin, douse it with lighter fluid and start a conflagration with conflagration if i could."

1/16/2016,"just quickly on the subject of risk... i felt safer mining in provi than i do in high sec. earned more as well.when i look at courier contracts, i sometime think ""who would move that stuff for so little isk?"". with the increase in plex prices (last year they were about 800mill?) it is getting harder to plex an account by mining... the high end of the income levels possible in high sec are, i am sure, ridiculous... but not everyone of us has 8 accounts logging in after downtime to mine an ice field to extinction, and then again when it comes back up again. the average hisec carebear (who wont be reading these forums, or sadly voting in the election) will not be making that much.i don't think risk vs reward is the only variable to consider. fun vs reward is also very important. mining an ice belt in a skiff is not much fun. there is not much to do except watch netflix or browse youtube. the income i get from it is not enough to justify the lack of fun, and the risk is relatively minimal."
1/16/2016,"attention pilotsi am brodit, i am pleased to announce my candidacy for csm xi. i would like to represent, you, the community from whom i have taken so much. consider it pay back. i will, to the best of my ability represent your needs and desires to ccp for the betterment of us all. i will do this with a light heart and a steely resolve. i may not be serious about the craft, but i am very serious about the community and the need for clear communication both ways. to those ends i am not standing on any specific issue but will be available for discussion either directly through the in game public channel brodit<U+FFFD>s surgery or indirectly via eve mail. i don<U+FFFD>t have a prepared platform to stand on i will simply reflect the views brought to me by the community. my view is this, if i have an agenda that i want to pursue; i go to fanfest and simply grab one of devs from the relevant team and bend their ear. if i catch them at the bar, i can feed them beer, if i catch them in the smoking tent they can<U+FFFD>t even see the exit let alone run for it. useful tactics to take forward to the csm.biographyin 2004 my mate described eveonline as a sandbox <U+FFFD>as open ended as any pen and paper roleplaying game<U+FFFD>, a bold claim i was immediately sceptical of, sorry baldie. after watching him play and extensive research on my part i realised he was probably right and in 2006 started playing. i remember reading the dev blog for new players and it saying how it was impossible to be a generalist in new eden, at some point we are all forced to specialise. never tell me what i can<U+FFFD>t do, i<U+FFFD>ll move heaven and hell to prove you wrong. well it<U+FFFD>s almost ten years later, i was right, they were wrong. admittedly it has taken that long to have the skill set to call myself a generalist but i finally did it.my playstyle is fairly random and dictated by what i want to do at that moment. i like mining and don<U+FFFD>t really care where i do it, high sec., null sec., even wormhole. i don<U+FFFD>t mine in low sec. unless i am bait or ninja mining. my career as a miner began in 2006 in high sec. until i moved out to null sec where it continued, however what is the point of mining all those minerals if you can<U+FFFD>t manufacture stuff with them; so studied production skills. early on i realised that even if you can<U+FFFD>t fly combat vessels you can still die to them, so i trained some rudimentary combat skills and opened up mission running and exploration skill sets. i was well on the way to being the pilot i am now. in spite of numerous sojourns to null sec. i could never find the right alliance, with the possible exception of ushra<U+FFFD>khan, unfortunately they were in cascade mode so i returned to empire. finally, in 2012 with my bucket list thinning, i joined a wormhole alliance. my skills as a generalist are ideal in this environment, three years i<U+FFFD>ve been here i don<U+FFFD>t think i<U+FFFD>ll ever leave. all of new eden is on my doorstep, anything i want to do i can, anything my corp mates want to do we can. wins all round. communitylike any society there are bits of this community i love, bits i hate and other bits which i neither know nor care about. this is a list of some of those things. for a game which purports to be all about the pew the alliance tournament is a perennial disappointment. it is cumbersome, implausible and as far from the daily experience of the player base as you can get. whereas the tuskers always come out with something which is entertaining and at least is recognisably part of new eden. the eve_nt tourney is cool, smaller gangs with greater accessibility to the community is another example of a great pvp format. for the same reason i really liked the recent rites of succession for the amarr. theorycrafting for a match which starts an hour later provides a greater challenge for the participants as well as a making the results far less predictable. can i just say <U+FFFD> kador were robbed.i love player gatherings. been to a few, fanfest obviously is always a blast. surprisingly good natured considering how vitriolic wars in new eden can get. not that i<U+FFFD>m surprised, rob a man of his anonymity and you force him to engage his brain before his mouth. shame the same can<U+FFFD>t be said of public forums. i<U+FFFD>ve been to a few local meets which is handy for recognising people when you head to ff. i was even at the launch party for dust in newcastle, hammered doesn<U+FFFD>t even begin to describe how drunk i got. i talked shop with fellow miners, talked pew with a couple of guys from pl, talked about player gatherings with the guy who organised the 10th anniversary celebration of eveonline.and finally <U+FFFD>i am scottish and all this earnestness is making my teeth ache, excuse me while i rip the ****. you<U+FFFD>ll all want to know what experience i have to represent the community. none. if 10 years as a pilot in new eden doesn<U+FFFD>t qualify me as an expert nothing will. i don<U+FFFD>t blog, (two posts does not a blogger make). i write stuff but not as a writer, but as a memory aid for storytelling. most recently i wrote a bunch of <U+FFFD>jokes<U+FFFD> for a stand-up routine, comedy like storytelling is stylised lying or lying for dramatic effect and i lie like a politician; especially when it is unnecessary. lying is an art form, it requires constant practice because you never know when you will have to deliver an absolute whopper. anyone who doesn<U+FFFD>t believe ccp lies needs to look up the phrase commercially sensitive information. by extension, anyone who thinks the csm doesn<U+FFFD>t lie doesn<U+FFFD>t understand the meaning of nda. i do, but then i have politkicking to level 5.if you like what i have to say, i will need your vote. i have no bloc vote to rely on nor a blog for self-promotion. if you<U+FFFD>re unsure, public channel is brodit<U+FFFD>s surgery, come talk to me direct.fly well.tl;dr vote brodit, the csm member this community deserves."

1/16/2016,"welcome to the csm xi campaign page of sullen decimus.who am i?i am an avid eve player involved in a very broad spectrum of game play since 2012. i have participated in virtually all forms of pvp/pve in all levels of security space including wormholes. in a few years, i have twice earned the title of director -- in two different corporations with entirely different forms of game play. i<U+FFFD>m a director in polaris rising, a member of the bastion null sec alliance holding sovereignty in vale of the silent. we participate in a vast variety of activities from large scale battles to small roams at the corporate level, the sig level, the alliance level, and the coalition level. i have led large scale fleets and faced other null sec entities, several times outmatched and/or outnumbered.i also remain active in a mid-sized, 5-year old wormhole corporation living in c2s through c5s which i was a part of before null sec. this has a different lifestyle from null sec sov and i still hold a directorship, occasionally live-streaming my wormhole adventures.although not directly related, i am also the ceo of one of the few remaining active dust 514 corporations, furthering my investment in a broad range of activities throughout new eden.in real life, i am an engineer with a security clearance that has worked on virtually every aircraft the u.s. navy operates. i currently work on the a-10 jet for the u.s. air force. that being said, if you met me in vegas you would know that i like my rum and coke, parties and clubs so i thoroughly enjoy socializing. why should you vote for me?unlike many players i am heavily invested in multiple disciplines. i feel the vast majority of candidates are campaigning for a single form of game play in new eden. in my opinion this is detrimental to progression as they will have a natural bias for their goals. the individual systems also need to work well together. the diversity of game play is important - not just to prevent boredom but also burnout. i<U+FFFD>m prepared to advocate for a number of different game play activities and styles at the same time. i also would like to change the face of the csm as i am not a member of the <U+FFFD>old guard<U+FFFD> which has been prevalent for years. i was at the famous battles for fountain and b-r5rb, however not in a capital ship so my experiences and memories are vastly different than some of the older members. i do not have the goal of trying to return to old, but rather how to better the future.in recent years there has been a very real deterioration in the csm-ccp relationship. two factors contributing to this are a lack of trust from ccp and lofty expectations of csm members - pushing their agendas to the breaking point. as an engineer i am very familiar with not only realistic expectations but also confidentiality of sensitive material. one of my goals would be to mend this relationship so that the csm can again be a relevant contributor to the game we all love and play."

1/16/2016,"i believe that the structure changes are going to provide a different kind of game play. there is going to be a different kind of risk in wormholes. as well as not knowing how many possible people could be online there is going to be a shake up with capitals. i'm excited to see caps getting changed, but refuse to accept the whole no refitting while in combat. that is ludicrous if ccp follows through with it as it reduces our quality of life as well as survival during any fights. but overall i hope these changes someone change and bring more people into wormholes to try and have some more fun. it'd also be nice if higher classes received dual statics so there are more chances for pvp as well as easier access.thanks proc miss you a bunch. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8>

(i miss that group); and it's good to see you taking another shot at participating with the csm. i do have a few questions, and i see that i'm late to this party:1) during your last term as a member of the csm, i never had an issue getting in touch with you, chatting with you, and getting my voice heard, but i will say that toward the latter part of your term, you fell off the wagon a bit. you got a little crazy with your representation and gameplay, and even said at one point that you didn't care. although it seemed rather reckless, do you feel that your last term was fruitful in terms of supporting and representing the wormhole community and the eve playerbase?2) you said earlier that you would strive to make citadels ""fun and useful"", and knowing how much experience you've had in wormholes, and your understanding of mechanics and gameplay in the wormhole environment, what are some things about citadels that you would like to see that you, personally, would see as fun and useful?3) how would you propose making wormholes mysterious again without killing the community or gameplay?all the things said in the thread aside, i've known chitsa for years and although he's on the insane side of crazy sometimes, he is a genuinely great person, approachable, friendly, and has always made time for me and others when we wanted to chat about anything. flying with chitsa was always an adventure, and i really do wish you the best during your campaign, and i hope that if you earn a seat, that you use it to the fullest and capitalize on the opportunity."

1/17/2016,"isn't that the point? there a significant group of players who claim they run highsec incursions not because the enjoy them, but because it has one of the highest isk/hr in the game and comes with essentially zero risk thus no losses and only minimal downtime. should not the game be structured so that these players can earn a rewarding income in the space they like to live and roam, rather than be compelled by the risk vs. reward balance to return to highsec to grind an income most efficiently in incursions, blitzing l4s, afk mining or whatever? making the safest space one of the most rewarding also has the detrimental effect of depleting the other sectors of space of activity, targets, and thus content decreasing the chance of player interaction and interesting gameplay. should not the game be structured so that if you like running incursions or afk mining you can, but it is not so lucrative (given the near zero risk - and no, you should not feel more at risk mining in a skiff in highsec as you have almost no chance of being ganked) that it incentivizes other players to return to highsec for the sole reason it maximizes their isk (or effort) per hour, while killing their fun per hour?"
1/17/2016,it's always nice to see more wormhole candidates. a quick look at your killboard shows that you are indeed a miner with little to no pvp experience in the past few years - how do you feel you will be able to adequately represent the wormhole community on pvp issues and wormhole pvp mechanics that you may not even be familiar with?one of the most debated issues in high class space at the moment is the potential changes to capital escalations - how will you be able to relate to these issues?
1/17/2016,"your quite correct i have minimal pvp experience, that in itself is not a bar to representation as i have plenty of friends who are very knowledgeable who i can pester for in depth information on the subject. more importantly if a hardened pvper comes to me with concerns they will have the knowledge and experience to clue me up. generally proposed changes within the game are flagged up well in advance of implementation, then discussed at length in the forums and beyond. so studying those may provide the insight i need.the escalations you mention i read the dev blog and it was particularly light on details, very heavy on the tone of the changes ccp want to implement. having read up on the forums there seems to be lots of speculation on what this will mean to escalations but without some real numbers to crunch that will be hard. all this makes my job easier. i poll the most common concerns of the community and take them to the dev teams. moreover if pilot a says these changes mean this and pilot b says the changes mean the exact opposite, i get the delightful job of representing both views to ccp. hopefully we get some clarification. i suspect that we both know pilot c will come along and come up with a clever workaround. love new eden.cheers for taking the time to post your inquiries braxus. you also raised another aspect i would like just touch on, if anyone does come to me with specific areas they want to discuss, if they could bring linkage for the discussion it immediately gives us a common thread in which to frame our discussions. obviously this extends across the spectrum of eve life not just to wormhole or pew."

1/17/2016,"eve online is not a game, or better: eve online is not one game. in fact it is a pvp game, a pve game, a traders game, a management game, a production game etc. it<U+FFFD>s is so various that one could say <U+FFFD>. eve is real!as a proud member of red frog freight i will run for csm xi. some of you allready have seen me at gfleet 2015, evesterdam 2014/2015 or fanfest 2012/2015. remember last fanfest that bright tall handsome guy with long waving blond hair and a marvelous sweet voice? that wasn<U+FFFD>t me.i gave the presentation pro space truckers on fanfest 2015. there i told how much i like to be one of the non fighting guys, without hating the fighting ones. eve is for all and all should be for eve.for me this means two things.first about development: the driving force is the pvp part. the more is destroyed, the more the other gamers have to do to fill up the broken parts. and for that it is not suprising that a lot of dev work goes into the big explosions, the shiny hulls and the dealing of damage.but i.m.h.o. it is now time to spent some dev time too on other parts of eve. the exchange and courier contractmanagement in eve is<U+FFFD>, well<U+FFFD>, not up to date at the least. think in terms of standard contracts, standard terms for contracts to you or your corp, less clicks/pages per contract. there is a lot to talk about when looking at contracting.the way we can handle our assets in eve is terrible. little things like stacking at a distance hangar, easy splitting of a big stack in a hangar, making easier filters that one can save. a total overhaul of the asset window is needed.hauling asssets can be a pain. containers that need to be station traded? why? or what to think of the removal of the 200 items per contract limit? one could also think about a way to set your destination from a courier package?second about the pilots:a big part of the pilots are non pvp. one could say: <U+FFFD>if they don<U+FFFD>t want to fight, let them play another game<U+FFFD>. but who will make then the shiny ships and the tons of ammo you need to blow up things? who will haul your stuff while you take down a titan? in an economy so complex as that of eve we simply need those pilots big time! and a lot of them. although i am not saying one must not shoot at them, i don<U+FFFD>t think that making them sitting ducks is the way to go. we need them and after all they do pay for subscriptions as well, so we should not totally neglect them in dev time. and when they can do their stuff easier and in less time<U+FFFD>maybe you will some day find one of them at your six putting me in csm xi would not give you the man in the csm with the answers. i am good, but not that good . if i had all the right answers i would post them here and be done with it. putting me in csm xi would give you someone there who would made sure these issues will be on the table and talked about. and then help the pilots and the devs to come to the best solution for this. to make sure there will be time for non pvp related issues and for non pvp player issues. to make sure we try to make a better game for all, not just for a happy few.be assured that if we can get population to 50k, that means a lot of targets more, and more to produce and haul also. we need more new players without dumbing the game down. it is and should be a game where one has to work to achieve things.and believe me. at the end,all will benefit. especially the pvp pilots. more time for all to spent in space hitting stuff, less time clicking in a hangar.i even have ideas about t4 ships <U+FFFD> regards and good luck to all others running for csm xi(ps you all know that xi in holland is called the fools number? who then would suit better then a crazy frog ?)"
1/17/2016,email sent. looking forward to it
1/17/2016,"not a big fan of backstage, but i am a big fan of utari onzo. very pleasant surprise to see you running, you'll be on my ballot for certain. best of luck there's really only three areas of eve that interest me; wormholes/wormhole pvp, roleplay and avatars.your stance and ambitions in regard to wormholes and roleplay you've made pretty clear. i'm interested also to hear your thoughts on avatar development; i'm not talking about ""wis"" or anything like that, more just in terms of encouraging ccp to introduce more items for our characters and spend a little effort on further development surrounding avatars in general. though perhaps with an ultimate long-term vision of some form of ingame avatar social interaction or pvp gameplay. part-time wormhole pirate <U+30C4> full-time supermodel <U+25B7> wor<U+043C><U+043D>ole d<U+03B9>ary + c<U+043D>aracer <U+03B9>o <U+25B7> sss"
1/17/2016,"thank you, and to all the +1ers so far.in regards to avatars, the single biggest thing on my wish list is hats. seriously. it's one of those ""little things"" (though likely not little at all for ccp to make) that would add to avatars positively, and would be something i'd be ok with being vanity items.my other ambition is for a wider cross selection on hair styles and tattoos. right now you're 'race locked' in terms of certain hair styles are only available to certain races. once you're a capsuleer, you'd naturally be exposed to different cultures and styles across the cluster, so why not be that bold caldari civire that decides to get dreadlocks, or a gallente who gets tribal marks because they look cool. this one i think should be easier to implement.finally, i hope, after we've been in ""fixing"" mode for eve for some time now, that ccp will find the courage to dedicate some time and resources back into wis. we've already seen a basic trip to the bar in action, and honestly that's all it needs to start off with, a few places to visit then expand from there. this one is likely to be on hold till after player stargates and any ""new space"" comes out, but i would love to see that old door in my quarters get opened, even just a little.""face the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it, the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it, burn away his evil"""
1/17/2016,"this pretty much answered the only questions i had for you.great to see you running, and your focus on lore and live events would be great to have within the csm. that, plus your support for seeing some more avatar content introduced, means you'll be on all my ballots.good luck!  part-time wormhole pirate <U+30C4> full-time supermodel <U+25B7> wor<U+043C><U+043D>ole d<U+03B9>ary + c<U+043D>aracer <U+03B9>o <U+25B7> sss"
1/17/2016,"between gorski, apothne and nashh i will be facing a difficult challenge who to put on the top spot. thankfully i have exactly three accounts and can switch them around. this man pours his heart into the eve community and it shows. he is not simply a lowsec candidate but a candidate for everyone who wants to see eve thrive as an environment where people can come together.the only caveat i can think of with his candidacy is that i fear he will not have the time to do all the wonderful things he has done to make eve more than just a game but also an environment where relationships are established and friendships are forged.oh, and a wife and kids he probably should be there for too :)"
1/18/2016,"that's nice and simple, and has no impact on the reality that most people are not flying around in interceptors to do everything in the game. bcs/bss, industrials, barges, etc are the backbone of eve-online, and they move dirt slow. the only scale that needs to change, is the time scale; less time moving around, more time actually playing the game.no one cares about the au distance in either universe, time however, is very important in both. wasting time, moving around eve, is a huge turn off for many people. i can ask any 0.0 vet, and get the same reply - they hate moving. everyone hates moving - because it takes up too much time doing next to nothing, we want to play the game.gamers across the globe are no longer interested in mmorpgs that require massive amounts of time to play; wow reduced the time to level, most other mmorpgs are out of business, league of legends is being beaten by their competitors that created the same format of game, and have reduced the time of the matches people have to play, because that is what players want, less time wasted, more time playing.all that is being asked is for ccp to do something to reduce the time wasted in game moving around at such slow speeds. ccp, it would help increase the player/subscriber base, if you would address the current state of gamers, and reduce the amount of time spent doing next to nothing 'moving around', and instead gave us more time actually playing the game.try it, you'll like it."
1/18/2016,"two words: power. projection.the easier/faster you make movement around eve, the more you encourage people to project their power (especially in places where they don't live). this, in turn, forces people to consolidate with others and form greater and greater power blocks (which self-reinforces this loop).moreover, easier movement stifles local industry and regional hubs as it encourages ""one-market-hub"" thinking."
1/18/2016,this was a really well done interview and bobmon did well.
1/18/2016,"when you're looking through the list of csm candidates, invariably you'll find people with ""platforms"". hopefully by now voters should know that is not how the csm works - it isn't game developer junior. what you want in a candidate is someone who is active in the game, is driven, and in touch with the players enough to understand the issues and pain points. bobmon not only shows those traits now, but he has a track record of showing them. it's not a gimmick to get elected, not a flash in the pan - it's just what he does. in short: he's got the traits of a great csm delegate."
1/18/2016,+1 for bobmon
1/18/2016,"now that ccp has done a dev blog on selling skill points and we know it is coming in february, what is your position on this?"
1/18/2016,"apothne, will you play a 5 man stack of dota with me? thanks."
1/18/2016,"jin'taan is an excellent fc with very good knowledge of the game.i like his agenda for this csm,so it's a +1 from me."
1/18/2016,"i am personally happy with high sec right now. i think the biggest misconception is that high sec is the safe zone, ccp has never pushed it as a safe zone more a safer area than the rest. i have two characters that primarily make high sec their home and travel in it without incident with only the occasional km. i think it's important to remember the role that gankers serve in the overall eve ecosystem and messing around with that will cause unintended consequences. if your getting ganked follow the eve philosophy and get even. blow them up."
1/18/2016,"that already exists. i have a few experimental haulers and miners that i use to bait ganks to test some ideas. one retriever in particular is running well over 50% survival right now. it's all in preparation and reaction.welp, you just forced all of low and null to completely change how they manage their security. that you think this sort of idea would ever get off the ground tells me just how poorly you've thought this out.highsec is indeed worth saving. but it won't be saved by further insulating residents from having to interact with those around them."
1/18/2016,"greetings fellow pilots!my name is toxic yaken, and i want to represent highsec for csm xi.i have been playing eve online for the better part of two years, almost entirely based in highsec. i am a ganker, wardeccer, scammer, and former awoxer, and i make my living as such. at the moment i am flying with the dickwad squad, a small corporation in rabble alliance, and losing all my ships in the process has been my specialty.the csm is meant to connect the player base to ccp, and so i have been trying to do just that. rather than only letting players come to me, i<U+FFFD>ve been taking time to reach out to players to try and capture better opinions and ideas of issues facing highsec residents. while i can<U+FFFD>t make promises for change, these are some points that i am interested in raising or continuing in discussion with ccp and other members of the csm:new player experiencefor players who take the time to try every career agent and see everything that eve has to offer, the npe is extremely pve focused. i know that i and many others would like to see more early game training on concepts such as basic combat tactics, fittings, and how to use a d-scan. providing career missions for new players to try pvp combat of some variation would be ideal.warsthere are quite a few problems with wars in general, and simply changing the cost to declare war on a corporation or alliance aren<U+FFFD>t going to fix them. the biggest issue with wars is that a lot of highsec corporations or alliances don<U+FFFD>t want to fight. there are also a lot of corporations that have no reason to fight. there needs to be better incentives to combatting a war than weaponized boredom or dropping out of corporations and reforming an hour later. i know that some players are very adamant that they want to play the game a certain way and have no interest in learning how to pvp, and i think that those players will continue to struggle under any wardec system, but providing those who simply feel they cannot fight back with more options and incentives could help improve wars.npe: i<U+FFFD>m repeating myself, but obviously providing those that are interested in learning pvp, fittings, and so on, early in their lives will at least have some idea of how to fight back.mercenaries: mercenaries have been around for a long time, but a lot of them exist far above the possible incomes of newer players - create a board similar to corporate adverts for mercenaries so they can provide services, price points, where they primarily operate, and so on. this concept could be used for other services such as hauling as well.surrenders: provide more surrender options for negotiation, such as a surrender cost in addition to a surrender offer, length of peacetime before any new wars can be declared, or even an exchange of assets. costs: i think that the cost of wardecs could use some review in the case of wardeccing smaller, newer players. i don<U+FFFD>t want to see new players being farmed for kills and being scared out of the game. that said i don<U+FFFD>t want to see new players being protected from pvp, because it<U+FFFD>s a huge part of the game that they need to be aware of. highsec isn<U+FFFD>t safe.redefining wars: unless a corporation has structures in highsec to defend or are confident in their pvp capabilities, there is usually little reason for them to turn out and fight a wardeccer. steve ronuken suggested the idea of attackers setting up structures to declare war that could be destroyed and end the war, but against large mercenary and wardec corporations i feel like smaller corporations would stand no real chance to destroy them under their noses. similar to the idea of providing corporations with more beneficial structures worth defending, it still leaves a lot of smaller corporations who can<U+FFFD>t afford them no reason to fight. i<U+FFFD>m also interested in seeing more information about citadels and how they might change living in highsec and if if they might make wars more worth fighting.defender incentives: another avenue is to provide defenders with additional bonuses considering there is no real way to win a war as a defender. some ideas include an increased insurance payout for lower sp characters to encourage defenders to actually turn out and fight, or rewarding the defender with the wardec fee if they come out of the war on top. there could also be an incentive given to corporations that promote longevity and activity in highsec, so there is at least a reason not to disband a corporation at the moment<U+FFFD>s notice of a wardec.missionsi<U+FFFD>ve personally not spent a lot of time running missions, but at a recent evemeet, i was told that mission runners would love to see a greater variation of missions, (i guess you can get bored blowing up the same pirate or saving some scientists so many times) but also provide some form of scaling difficulties for missions based on how many players would enter a mission pocket, so that missions could be more challenging and fun to run in groups. [cont.]"
1/18/2016,"corporations & societiesi know that over the last year, a lot of fear in my community was generated over the proposed idea of social corporations, a construct that would allow players to start a corporation protected from wardecs at the expense of not being able to anchor structures. i'm completely against this concept, but i don<U+FFFD>t think enough people know jayne fillion's update about the development of this idea to societies and wanted to repost this:though i think that a better name for societies might be communities, (hue) i am whole-heartedly in favour of the development of societies to provide better cross-corporate/alliance communication and organizational tools than the current channels and out of game methods in place currently. giving groups such as bombers bar, anti-ganking, incursion runners, and so on, better means to communicate and organize themselves outside of corporate structure can only make the game better. it would also be a nice way to show your support and pride for groups such as plex for good and broadcast 4 reps!ganking & bumpingi have zero issues with the state of ganking in highsec as it is right now. i also realize that bumping is a point of contention, but bumping still exists outside of ganking, and serves important purposes in bumping capitals, suspect baiters, and others. i also don<U+FFFD>t want to see bumping in highsec altered to much because i see freighter ganking as a fun, low skill requirement pvp experience that is pretty heavily dependant on bumping. i<U+FFFD>m interested in hearing feedback on bumping though.bounties and bounty huntingin the time that i've been playing, bounties haven't served much a purpose. for highsec criminals, they have become badges of honour, rather than a cause for concern, and unless you catch someone with a decent bounty flying something big and shiny, your payout will generally be very small. i want to see more incentives to go after the bad guys. one option is to give the pilots that put up for a bounty the option to pay out the full amount if they are satisfied with the kill. another could be to remove faction police and instead requiring players to handle criminals, suspects, and faction warfare targets with rewards for doing so. this is another subject i would love to hear more feedback on.and on a lighter note<U+FFFD>piracy!i love being a pirate, but my pool of activities has grown smaller since i started. i would like to see more piracy that doesn<U+FFFD>t break the game but lets me plunder. harpoon highslot module: because harpoons, but also<U+FFFD> let<U+FFFD>s say your small gang catches a legal target, brings them down to extremely low hull, but instead of popping them, fires a harpoon into the opposing ship. as long as the ship doesn<U+FFFD>t manage to break a certain range, reach a speed that would cause the harpoon<U+FFFD>s rope to break, or repair its hull/armor/shields over a certain amount of time, the target<U+FFFD>s pod would pop out, be unable to reboard for some time, and allow the gang to board and steal the ship. essentially you would need to have the target webbed, neuted, and nearly dead already, but it would actually create some real piracy instead of just blowing up everything that comes by and scavenging the wrecks. evemeet!i<U+FFFD>m very fortunate to live close to toronto where there is already a decent sized and well organized evemeet, and would love to see more of them pop up with ccp support because they are really fun. the first one i attended about seven months ago was privileged to have ccp terminus visit us, and he gave out some really cool swag in addition to some plex prizes handed out by our local isd member. i<U+FFFD>ve made a bunch of friends, drank a lot of good beer, and found a great deal of support from everyone at the toronto evemeet. i would highly recommend checking out any evemeets that may be happening near you at"
1/18/2016,"toxic and i have talked quite a bit about the changes he'd like to make to highsec. i like almost everything he has to say on the subject, and want to point out a few things about his platform:- while his background is more to the ""villain"" side of things, he's interested in making highsec a more compelling experience for all involved. when people like us have run in the past, they've been accused of only wanting to make highsec friendlier to their specific playstyle. toxic's ideas as i understand them are much broader than that.- a lot of his focus is on creating more player-driven content in highsec, which is definitely in short supply.- the changes we've discussed either have no impact on life outside highsec, or would benefit all players together. of particular note is his model for adding communities to the game: that system would be of great use to coalitions and regional organizations in null and w-space."
1/18/2016,"oh! my feedback on the subject of bumping:i'm mostly a fan of it. i think it's an important mechanic and removing it or heavily modifying it would have sweeping effects on a lot of other parts of the game. we simply can't predict what it would do. that said, i think the ability to permanently tackle a freighter without committing an aggressive act is a bit much. i could get behind an idea for something that would allow an attentive freighter pilot (non-afk) to escape repeated bumps. here's an idea i sort of threw together when it came up earlier today:a low slot module similar to a higgs anchor rig, but with a burst effect that would allow a quick escape. when activated, it would act as a heavy web on the activating ship, slowing it and giving it increased agility and reduced inertia. this would obviously need some stiff drawbacks and a long cooldown to prevent freighters that instawarp on every jump, but the design would be such that it could facilitate one quick escape when used properly. this would allow a freighter pilot to properly fit and fly their ship in a way that they could escape a prolonged bumping session without directly nerfing bumps or ganking. this is just spitballing an idea, so don't get too much in a twist over it if you don't like it."
1/18/2016,wormhole delegates play a very important role on the csm. one of the most useful members the csm has ever seen was two step - a wormhole player. but having a wormhole player who also understands the growing interaction between k-space dwellers and w-space dwellers?! that's a double whammy super awesome combo.
1/18/2016,"i support vic's csm campaign.he is pragmatic, mature and capable of viewing the larger picture.i strongly support hs, wh and austz players to get behind his csm campaign. we will see a long term, dedicated player elected with the ability to listen, understand and influence a large body of the eve-verse.i understand i am part of the same corp and easily seen as biase, but would give him my full backing regardless of this.tupac. anonymous."
1/18/2016,"greetings all! i amdomanark and i have decided to once again throw my hat in the ring for the csm. i am sorry about the late entry to the fray, but i wanted to make sure i had all my ducks in a row and be able to dedicate my attention and time to the csm. i have been playing eve since 2010. i started right off with 2 pilots a pvp and industrial/pve pilot. a decision i have been very happy with over the years as it has given me the opportunity to experience most of the aspects of this amazing game. here are some of the things i have had a chance to do during my time in eve: faction warfare <U+FFFD> former member of draketrain and wolfs brigade. first attempt at mining <U+FFFD> didn<U+FFFD>t like it. moved out to null-sec as a member of sev3rance alliance in the morsus mihi led northern coalition. experienced my first large fleet fights, sub-cap support fleets, cyno pilot and fleet scout. also went through an alliance wide move shortly followed by an alliance wide retreat. continued to hone my null-sec play in both pvp and industry with sev3rance in providence. experienced the difficulties and fun of nrds. joined rvb with an alt and had a great time with that wild bunch of players. joined a corporation in test as i was ready to try out flying capitals. enjoyed the cap fleets all the way up to and including the debacle of 6vdt. corporation left test and we formed our own alliance which gave me the chance to help get a new group off the ground and running. great experience and an eye opener as to what the leaders of the large alliances go through to provide a fun experience for their members. joined the rifterlings as i want wanted to give low-sec piratey pvp a try and i needed to work on my solo pvp skills as at the time i didn<U+FFFD>t have any skill. (not much better now) joined a friend in a wormhole corp, but it was short lived as i am apparently allergic to wormholes and the pills had to take made me grow hair where it shouldn<U+FFFD>t. about this time a friend and i created and began recorded an eve related podcast, clueless space nerds. cluelessspacenerds.com. 3 years later we are still going strong, having a great time making fools of ourselves. i have hosted 2 eve meet-ups in my hometown. i have also been able to attend a couple of other meet-ups in the region; as well as enjoying the chance to go to fanfest 2014.currently i am in one of the groups that splintered off the demise of black legion, rifterlings and i have my own alliance. clueless space nerds alliance, the only sov-holding podcast in the game!i would love for you all to vote for me and allow me to take my experience, positive attitude, fun-loving nature and ideas to the csm xi and represent you and your interests to ccp.things i feel strongly about and feel i have the experience to offer well thought out opinions on are the following: null-sec sov corporation management industry (not including mining) eve community events and support eve media and its role with-in the game. these are some of the items i think ccp still needs to work on in order to continue to improve our experience in this game we all love and i will support trying to get some attention to these items.-10 security standing pilots are wanted criminals and should be treated as such! not being able to dock in high-sec stations should be implemented. the current system has the faction police looking less effective than a group of blind, one-legged keystone cops. 10 security standing pilots in turn shouldn<U+FFFD>t be allowed to dock in pirate controlled stations. i know this isn<U+FFFD>t as goofy of a problem as the reverse, but i am pretty sure pirates don<U+FFFD>t want a bunch of goodie-two-shoes hanging out in their station if they aren<U+FFFD>t able to throw darts at them or pummel them until they cry. i still think battleships and battle cruisers need another look at their position in the progression tree. the gap between bc<U+FFFD>s and bs<U+FFFD>s and bs<U+FFFD>s and dreads feels out of place and needs to be adjusted. i love the ship skins and the new variations of some of the ships ccp has provided over this last year, but i would like to see some serious thought at adding a new class of ship or two after the balancing pass is complete for the ships. escort carriers? combat transports? i would like to see a renewed effort at ccp supported and ccp controlled live events. the last attempts have shown a great many people see the fun in them and they can excite the player base. the events just need some attention to the what, who, where, how and when of any given event. the decision as to how heavy handed ccp should be when running an event needs discussion as well. we have a community of players who spend a lot of time on various media outlets dedicated to eve and the players. i would love to see ccp get more involved in supporting these endeavors through in-game advertisement via billboards or mail to get the word out to specially the newer players that there is a place to go to enjoy other different aspects of the eve experience.last but certainly not least i believe the members of the csm are there for the players and to act as a liason to ccp for the players. they should be communicating and requesting ideas and feedback from the players to take back to the other csm members and ccp. this shouldn<U+FFFD>t be all about a members agenda or ideas but about what the players want and need from ccp to make the eve gaming experience the best it can be.thanks for your time and i hope you will vote for me and give me the chance to give you a voice.domanarkcluelessspacenerds.comdomanark co-host clueless space nerds podcast"
1/18/2016,finally. someone i can actually feel comfortable voting for <3
1/18/2016,here is the interview recorded by csm watch for the csm 11 election coverage: nameloading interviewenjoy !
1/19/2016,"this is an idea that crossed my mind after a pretty dark period in my life when i watched a lot of nuclear holocaust films like threads and the day after. it occurred to me that there is no weapon system like this in eve. the original titan doomsday weapons did a large amount of aoe damage with only the most heavily protected ships surviving. they were rebalanced and now only affect a single target, albeit with a devastating amount of damage. what if there was a weapon in eve that had severe consequences for firing it? with nuclear weapons, there is the brief intense burst of damage which leaves a city in ruins. however, the far more horrific effect is fallout: radioactive dust that slowly eats away at living tissue and effectively renders large areas uninhabitable. it's this latter part that i think could be interesting in large scale warfare in eve.two example long term effects that could be used for this theoretical weapon:* a gradually increasing damage over time effect, similar to that found during the recon mission* an effect that prevents ships from either warping in system or jumping in/out of it, effectively rendering travel impossibleit would be interesting to see how alliances would use such a weapon. would they use it as a ""scorched earth"" option, rendering a victory by an opposing faction pointless? would the weapon be used on a large scale, rendering large areas of null-sec unusable, forcing them to concentrate into the smaller, still usable regions?needless to say, a long term effect isn't the same as a permanent effect and systems would eventually become liveable once again, with the length of the weapon's effect, its initial damage spike, cost, etc a matter for balancing. i guess i'm mainly curious to see what people think about a true ""nuclear"" weapon in eve and how many people would push that button if it was there.(note: this is merely a thought experiment - not a request for something like this to be added)"
1/19/2016,"the new doomsdays will aoe neut everything around the ship firing them, does that count?can't jump out if your buddy has just sucked your cap dry."
1/19/2016,"if you don't like how long it takes to move around in large ships, don't fly them.this was answered in shah's post above this one. it relates to power projection and it deliberate.eve online has always been, and will hopefully always be, a niche game. those gamers who want instant gratification can find it elsewhere. those gamers who enjoy games on an epic scale can find it here.and what of the gamers who like the fact that eve is an entire galaxy, with said corresponding scale? why do we have to lose one of the few mmos available that actually has a sense of size to it?no, i wouldn't. i don't like instant gratification games. i like games on a grand, epic scale. allowing me to cross a galaxy in a few minutes in a ship the size of a city kills that scale."
1/19/2016,"so, xenuria.you want me (amongst others) to send you to iceland so that you can ""reform"" the csm?when you were asked to define ""reform"", you decided to define the word ""reform"" and not how you would reform the process.i've read through your thread, and you know what? no, i won't be voting for you. there are too many smart mouthed politicians in real life without adding you to the list.come up with some actual reforms to the csm, and how you would change eve for the better."
1/19/2016,i am sorry you feel that way.
1/19/2016,cant wait for fanfest and that csm reveal
1/19/2016,"i have already taken a public stance on this topic in my campaign platform.""i do support making skill points another commodity through the recently announced transneural packages, and i would also lobby once this feature is implemented to remove the character bazaar entirely, so that all pilots history and name remain tied to the player that created them in the first place.""the fact of ""extracting"" knowledge is very much a part of the game's cyber punk roots and sci-fi inspirations. furthermore, isn't it that the knowledge as well as the thoughts of all of us capsuleers are copied like mere data banks into new clones every time our pod is destroyed? hopefully ccp is already working on an angle to introduce this in the lore of the game, and we soon see some new scope video or tickers related to it, if this has not already been the case.i believe the feature is a great way to bring younger players up to speed faster, and is a better way of doing it than buying a character in the market. i also listened with interest to those that pushed the ideas of selling specific skills rather than generic skill points, but in the end, i believe that would be counter productive as, like ships, not all skills are created equal in usefulness and utilities, and being stuck with useless skills would be the same as being stuck with a drake you could not sell before the latest pass on battleships was done. i also appreciate that ccp has made the higher sp character still able to milk 150 000 sp out of a package instead of 50 000 as first intended. i also hope ccp has a plan to add new high end skills that only the oldest pilots will be able to master. skills with heavy requirements, that will give the most dedicated veterans new abilities to explore new avenues in all areas. i believe the tree skill must continue to grow, its latest deepest branches being there for the older players to conquer first. if iam part of csmxi, this is something i would support actively."
1/19/2016,i don't know what a 5 man stack is but yes.
1/19/2016,"so, you think you should be on the csm because you are ""used to attending meetings, and utilizing critical thinking within them to help stop one viewpoint from being drowned out""optimism. i like that. buzzwords and synergy speak... not so much.the national council for excellence in critical thinking defines critical thinking as the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analysing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.buzzwords.now that i've got that off my chest. i have read your stuff in this thread, and have to say that a vote for you would not be a wasted vote."
1/19/2016,"i'm going to ask a question that can, altough rather simple, say a lot about the candidate.what are you training right now?"
1/19/2016,"hah, just logged in to make sure, and caldari offensive systems v popped up as completed, so i won't have to mention just how i lost a tengu and had to retrain that skill.right now i'm chugging through the slog that is fleet command v, and have been on a will/cha remap for related skills for some time. i don't specifically need to have leadership skills, as most of the time i tend not to use command ships in a fleet situation for fear of both getting headshot, and also due to my much higher sp alliance mates being able to lend their own perfectly skilled alts/mains to the job.i started training these skills again during one of the patches that delegating boosts actually worked reliably, as giving fleet warps and being able to use the regroup function are very useful tools available to an fc. however, right now they seem to be rather random as to whether they work, sit and cycle in the 'changing position' limbo for eternity, or just flat out fail to function. it's probably one of the 'little things' i'd more selfishly try to bring to the attentions of the devs, though i'd want to wait until after seeing the implementation off the anti-off grid booster changes which have been years in the coming, just to see if the issue would even be relevant.from an fc's perspective i look forwards to said changes, as they will provide a little bit more strategic depth to combat, as i will have to choose between killing their boosting ship to reduce their whole fleet's effectiveness by a significant margin, or taking out more traditional early targets such as recons or logistics. this becomes especially interesting when it comes to talking about fleet comps with certain weaknesses exaggerated by certain links, such as long range battleship fleets which tend to require skirmish boosts to their recons to extend their web ranges into the medium ranges, where sig tanking fleets might be able to operate. alternatively, compositions with (relative) low dps being able to kill their opponent's siege or armor links early would help give them staying power during an attrition fight where ship for ship trades are occurring.anyway, to get back on track, about 30 days deep into training fleet command 5 because i feel it may be necessary in the future for something i very much enjoy doing in the game, fcing."
1/19/2016,please define significant?one could maintain that there are a significant group of players that think high sec ganking should be not possible........
1/19/2016,yellow discipline?
1/19/2016,i don't think r-kelly would appreciate me taking his 'move'.
1/19/2016,i would like to encourage people to please post any questions you may have in this thread. i am seeing many people viewing but no comments being made. the more difficult the question the better. if i have to actually think about the response you are doing a good job as a voter. i look forward to the challenge.
1/19/2016,"much more indepth (and awesome) answer than i expected!thanks mr onzo. indeed. this is something that's been suggested for a very long time.commissar kate has/had a long-standing thread suggesting pretty much this. it got a ton of support, even from devs she'd spoken to apparently, yet was never implemented. you might find some useful discussion there if you haven't seen the thread before.i agree totally.i'm even of the mind i'd pay extra for such features, even a double-subscription (1 month pilots license, + 1 month 'station pass') for example. i hope one day we see a feature like this advanced a little. despite the cultural resistance i'm confident there's a huge segment of the playerbase that would get behind it and pay to use it.in anycase, i love your stance on wormholes, rp/lore and even avatars. +15 from me. dan<U+FFFD>"
1/19/2016,bump for a good fella.
1/19/2016,"what structures do you have in mind that you think should be either made or looked at or changed in some way?what ides for new player engagement do you have?and lastly, what do you think can be or should be done with the entosis mechanic?"
1/19/2016,can you expand further on this topic?
1/19/2016,more information please on your topics of interest. just the headers in and of themselves does not help anyone to understand your position on those topics
1/19/2016,"i am curious what your rationale is for these proposals. from a game design standpoint, it seems quite silly to lock players out of each other's space in a pvp game that is, at its heart, about player interaction. how would criminals interact with their victims as well as those that hunt them if they can't operate in highsec? conversely, how would positive-security status pirate hunters chase their targets if they could not base out of pirate stations?everything ccp has said lately (the empires are losing their grip!) suggests that the game is moving more towards a player-driven one, not one with more npc-enforced rules. it would seem to me that the faction police are more likely to disappear completely rather than security-status-based locks implemented which would hurt new players, and low-sec pvpers the most. is there a good reason that i am missing, from a game mechanics standpoint, why you think ccp is wrong and that your idea would be better for the game as a whole? or, are you just basing your proposal on ""lore""?"
1/20/2016,"all outstanding ideas (naysayers aside, as they're just here to express their impotent rage and the lack of hugs they received as children so they can **** on the hopes and dreams of others). keep them coming.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
1/20/2016,"here is another idea making a full expansion with a lot of features and content ready doesn't seem likely, but if it could start somewhere maybe this is a place to start.the idea is to be able to dock at some exploration structures, stations and planet sites, and have the possibility to team up and go together with maybe up to three others or more, and that the gameplay would be avatar related and involve investigating the structure, or a district or facility at a station or in a city. either alone or with others there could be several different aspects to this gameplay in order to be successful at the exploring or mission. there are challenges like decrypting, hacking, agility, salvaging, obstacles and combat, requiring a thoughful planning on what skills and items you and your group need to bring. it would be possible but hard to take on all the roles yourself, encouraging to bring someone with you.one reason why i think this is a good idea is that it adds the experiences of exploring and missioning to a dust type of game. you can also decide if you want to do it alone or with someone. the difference is that alone you can't succeed at all the objectives set for the mission or obtain all the loot from the exploring, so the rewards would maybe be about 1/4 if it is a mission designed to be appropriate for four people.maybe it wouldn't be too costly as some of the backgrounds and characters types could be similar to legion and so a lot of the work could be used again. there is no need for these areas to be very large either.it likely isn't possible to make a lot of different missions, so they need some things that make them replayable without making them feel ""grindy"". so it must make sense to do the missions again, with objectives that are reasonable would come up again, and to play the missions employing different tactics giving different rewards. explorer missions could be tweaked so that random different challenges await you, so you never know what skills would be perfect. here are some missions ideas that maybe would make sense to be replayable:investigating the less visited areas of a station, the station owner wants your group to find out why there is a power failure in a part of the station, you must go there in the dimly lit corridors and get the power back. it seems someone has tampered with the systems in order to avoid security in the illegal trading of contraband goods. you need the skills to scan for the problem area, repair it and deal with those responsible (or buy their goods). even if you stop the trade it is likely that this is something that will happen again.on planets you could have missions in cities, not the whole city but small parts of it. on the outskirts of a city, a mission could be that you have been tasked by a faction or npc corporation to find out if a competing faction or corporation have set up a spy network and if so take it down. with the grand vista of a city in the background, bringing down the network you need speciality in skills like decryption, hacking, scanning and security. even if you take the network down, it's not unlikely that the faction will try to set it up again. so it makes sense to do the mission again.to make the tactics different every time, some kind of randomness should be introduced, where is the area of power failure? where are the spy networks placed? and where do the enemies come from? you cannot use the same combat tactics every time when there are enemies coming unexpectedly with changing weapons. in structures for exploring, the challenges could vary from hacking old terminals and getting the power back up to get loot out the cargo doors to be picked up by the npc ship you hired to take you there.i think it is nice that you would need a strong versatility in your group to complete the missions fully.also it wouldn't affect the gameplay in eve at all unless you take part in it, as it would be separate and played indepently from eve, except with perhaps isk, aurum and plex connections. it wouldn't be a sandbox, yet at least, as it unfortunately seems to be restrictions in computer hardware. but it could be ready for it at some time, as this is just the start. it would instead be a small scale multiplayer taking place in the eve setting and be both a collaborative multiplayer and a competitive multiplayer. it would influence eve in the way that if you have a character there, the items and isk you get can be used there.the way to finance it would maybe be with a subscription like eve, but with a discounted total if you subscribe both to eve and this.the pvp part is a big difficulty in this idea, but there needs to be areas for this too, not sure how it should or could be implemented though.some place for interaction outside of the missions would almost be as important to have, like a central hub and market place before missions, meeting up with your corp and others in your faction, change gear with others, planning missions, journey to places together. particularly i am hoping for areas for sociality."
1/20/2016,"good idea - there's not much you can do without cap.by long term, i'm thinking the disruption lasting somewhere between a couple of weeks to a month. something to really deter people from just popping them off like titans. titans are a really good way of illustrating potential problems with nuclear weapons in eve. initially, titans were rare beasts and seeing one jump in to a major fight was a sign that you had really, *really* pissed someone off. the effect of titans has become less intimidating over the years as their numbers have inexorably grown. that's not necessarily a bad thing or good thing; it's just eve changing with time.so if a nuclear weapon was introduced to eve, with the possible effects outlined above, how could the supply of such weapons be limited? i have to admit that i don't know enough about supercapital production or the more advanced research types (t3 for example) to offer much in the way of input here. restriction of the bps would be a good idea, similar to the existing system for the revenant supercarrier. the other half would be the production of a crucial element in the weapon, similar to how uranium enrichment takes an enormous amount of power and time. again, just some idle thoughts, nothing more."
1/20/2016,so basically you're thinking of no-effort ways to troll the entire game at the click of a button.
1/20/2016,"while the op's thought does make me giggle, i'm going to have to say ""not supported.""this is a game. and some people just want to see the world burn. screw the long term consequences.(side thought; this would make spies in corporations/alliances absolutely deadly. just drop a nuke on a rival corporation/alliance's doorstep and watch dozens/hundreds/thousands of players be without a home the next day)"
1/20/2016,terribad idea is terribad.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
1/20/2016,"some people? most of the people i know would push the button just because. with very capable large ex-sov-powerblocs now living a much more nomadic life without much space of their own, i can already see all of new eden being turned into a nuclear wasteland just for ***** and giggles with a weapon like this.mutual assured destruction will not hold people back from firing these. there won't be a cold war situation like there has and in parts still does exist in the real world, as it's a game and people don't give a damn. not that i don't find the idea amusing, but i don't think eve would stay playable for long after it's release."
1/20/2016,"some really interesting responses here. thank you. ^^the post regarding a spy setting off a nuke was really intriguing. i suppose even if the weapon could only be deployed by having three senior members of an alliance turn the keys (so to speak), you'd still have infiltrators trying to work their way up, simply because of the potential damage that could be unleashed.as for people setting off potentially game changing weapons purely for trolling/giggles/sadism on an unprecedented scale, suffice to say it's this....unique....mindset that keeps me coming back to eve time and again. never change folks. <3there's one other factor i overlooked while i was running through this in my head - npc factions. how stable and safe would high-sec remain if the four major powers in new eden suddenly saw capsuleers setting off system-devastating weapons? from what i understand, capsuleers are seen as a necessary but unpopular evil by the amarr, gallente, etc. i doubt they'd still be as welcoming if stuff like this was going on in 0.0. the other side of the coin is if these weapons fell into npc hands. would we see a cold war and arms race kick off between the factions?as most folks here have said, it's extremely doubtful anything like this would ever be added to eve online. it's fun to speculate on though..."
1/20/2016,thx again for all the support :) i've applied as csm so there is no way back now :)my capstable interview is hopefully out in the the beginning of february.fly dangerous
1/20/2016,"to me it looks more like he wants to be on the csm because hes passionate about eve, knowledgeable about a major content driving area and knows that he can contribute to a professional discussion (which being on the csm is: you are an unpaid ""game consultant"") instead of throwing things out like: hurfblurf i will change this area of the game and stop climate change while im at it. a lot of thoose csm campaigns try the thing rl politicians do: promise x and y and think they are qualified because they are popular within x group of the game. which is dumb and bad and completly misses the point of the csm. so id rather see somebody going to iceland that is used to analysing systems, finding errors within them and fixing them because he does that for a living, instead of some memelord who thinks hes the **** because his peers say so."
1/20/2016,"yes, hi, hello, i have a question for the candidate. i do a large volume of high-sec production which includes, in part, mining wessels and equipment for mining wessels. cross referencing my sales of mining wessels and equipment for mining wessels against killboard statistics reveals that many of my sales are to miners whose mining wessels and, consequently, equipment for mining wessels, have recently been destroyed by ""ganks.""i would like to know how the candidate can realistically label herself as a """" while simultaneously proposing changes that would clearly be detrimental to highsec industrialists, particularly those producing goods in the mining wessel and equipment for mining wessels market segments.thank you."
1/20/2016,"thanks for stopping by my thread!have you also tried selling something else? there are lots of things out there to sell and make.but really... i think you might be overestimating the impact i would have on the csm - if elected. just because i think something or would like something, would not mean that ccp would run their pants off trying to implement it.i am a , and i also produce and sell stuff. and i would like high sec to get more interesting and attention. that is all."
1/20/2016,"yes, as mentioned, i produce many things in addition to mining wessels and equipment for mining wessels. i feel like this is irrelevant to the question, however, as my my ability to sell all of those things is contingent on the destruction of existing things, and the candidate is proposing a significant reduction in destruction across the board. furthermore, i do not understand how suggesting that you would be ineffectual in convincing ccp to implement your policy preferences makes you an ideal candidate to represent high security players. ""vote for me, i will have no particular effect!"" would be an interesting campaign slogan. additionally, i do not see how the inability to see a policy preference through to implementation is supposed to counteract the fact that your policy preference would, in fact, be detrimental to many high sec players."
1/20/2016,"of course i don't have the exact number, but various people discussing the issue say at least half of highsec incursion runners are alts of players who primarily play outside of highsec and just come back for the income. judging from the anemic acceptance of the drifter incursion, perhaps over 90% of incursion runners appear to be primarily motivated by isk/hr as the new content has been ignored by everyone but a few dedicated groups and everyone else is continuing to farm the sansha risk and effort-free like they have for years now. assuming this is correct, do you think it is healthy for the game for such a lucrative source of income to exist near risk-free in highsec?further, ccp quant gave us some economic numbers last fall which showed that less than 2% of players (on a given day) run incursions yet they are responsible for the 3rd largest isk faucet in the game. now this may argue that the effect on the overall game may be less a concern than i suggested above, but does then raise the issue of whether it is fair to reward these small group of players over 8t isk per month(which doesn't include the significant concord lp) for running stale pve content without risk. certainly, it is a concern to me that such easy isk is drawing people away from places they would rather live back to highsec, and if i was a small-group player looking purely for isk via pve content, looking at my options i would have almost no choice but to go with highsec incursions. do you share my concerns, or do you think i am off-base here?"
1/20/2016,"i fired a few questions off at mr ronuken this morning, and he was kind enough to send me some answers.steve ronuken - behind the platformhe gets my vote for the first reply tbh."
1/20/2016,have you ever participated in incursions? how do you feel about the money generated/ how many players actually run them?
1/20/2016,"yes i have actually participated in incursions both in highsec and in null sec. personally i feel these are rather broken for the simple reason that they don't match up well with ccp's philosophy of risk vs. reward. to begin with null sec incursions don't pay out nearly well enough considering what a pain in the ass they are to run. for starters the rats will scram and kill you easily on gates which doesn't happen in highsec. so even joining an incursion fleet in progress can be dangerous. they also can't be run with the efficiency of highsec incursions simply due to the likelyhood of being ganked. there is nothing your enemy would love more than to catch an hq fleet off guard. highsec incursions pay out extraordinarily well despite the relative safety of running them. i think this partially because the incursions are always scripted and we as eve players are very good at 'learning the game' when it comes to pve activities. i highly doubt when ccp envisioned them that they planned on hq sites being run in under 10 min a site. also ccp originally envisioned a pvp aspect in the pve environment with the concept of contesting sites for who would get the reward. while contests do happen, most of the major incursion groups have non-compete agreements among themselves so that everyone can maximize income. the end result is that not many can even come close to the necessary dps to contest sites and other than when there is incursion drama between the major groups it isn't as common of occurrence as originally expected. on top of this the lower end incursions (non-hq) require substantially more isk investment per ship than the hq sites. sure people bling out vindicators to the point of absurdity but the fact is you can still take a t1 battleship with barely over t2 mods fitted and make good money with a decent incursion group. lower level incursions aren't even worth the time for the most part unless you have high value (and very specific) t3 cruiser's. the lowest level of incursions barely (and sometimes don't) even make the hourly equivalent someone could do if they just ran solo level 4 missions.so to answer your question. they need a lot of work!"
1/20/2016,"how do you feel about being a cfc pet, and thereby willfully contributing to the stagnation of nullsec?have you ever been part of an alliance that was strong and independent, or do you think monolithic mega-colations are good for the game?"
1/20/2016,"i was wondering when someone would ask a question like that so thank you for getting it out there. i do not consider myself, my corp, or my alliance a cfc pet. especially when we have our own doctrines, fc's, and character from other alliances. if anything regardless of coalition standings, any status of 'pet' for an alliance was killed with phoebe. will we form up for coalition doctrines? yes. however gone are the days when an alliance could call a fleet and within 10 min have every alliance they are blue with at their battle call. strategic battles planned in advance are still a thing but jumping to a fleet while accruing 5 days of jump fatigue isn't useful to any fleet. as to your question to whether or not coalitions are good or bad thing i say they are neither. they are simply a product of game mechanics presented to us. if coalitions are to fight each other then there needs to be reasons. currently ccp hasn't given the coalitions a good reason to actually fight each other and little reason to not be a member of one. in fact some could argue phoebe actually encouraged mega block coalitions since logistically many regions would be completely inaccessible without having blue status to at least one or two other alliances. i don't think coalitions are good or bad. they're simply a product of the game mechanics presented. this is obvious by the fact that the large majority of nullsec alliances are in some form of coalition . if you want that to change ccp is the only one with the power to do so. simply asking alliances not to be in a coalition for 'honor' is no different than telling an athlete that he is working out too much and that he should tone back so that his competition can catch up."
1/20/2016,"you still are blue to them, and aid and abet their bloated empire and stagnation. from that perspective, you are a pet, and alliances like yours are enablers for the imperium's status quo to remain unchanged and unchallenged. your culture is pathetic, as you either willingly chose to exist as a vassal state, or could not actually stand on your own - either is a disgrace in my opinion, as both make new eden a more boring place. i'm not sure if you really believe that, are using it as a propaganda answer to feign responsibility for it, or are just ignorant. content ring was a thing - literally the poster child of how good aegissov could be. every other constellation had a different alliance in it, and the area hummed with activity and content. gangs came from far and wide to bask in the spectacle that was content ring, alliances brimmed with newbros to train in the fiery crucible of constant battle. it literally was an amazing place, rival only to the barleguet of yesteryear. all of that changed when the cfc could not stand content ring for multiple reasons; it destroyed their narrative of aegissov being rubbish, cfc players and corps were questioning their own leaderships permanent trade of stagnation for security when they saw how fun sov could be if people embraced it rather than fought it, and the desire to have cloud ring as another quiet buffer region for their sov holdings. content ring is a reminder to new eden that the cfc does not want, and has never wanted fun in this game. they will not tolerate it in any form and will burn it to the ground. the south and south-west hum with content, small alliances, and activity. these mechanics you speak of only seem to exist when pontificated to you from on high from other players, either by your puppet alliance leadership, or the leadership controlling them. basically there are plenty of entities that choose to exist, even prosper, outside of mega-coalitions. just the fact that they do exist invalidates the argument that mega-coalitions are the natural conclusion to the game mechanics as they are. to blame the mechanics entirely while completely failing to account for the role of politics holding together the cfc is to be at best horribly myopic, and at worst, a dishonest charlatan intent on ruling through deceit and misrepresentation. we already know who speaks for the coalitions. who will speak then, for the players?"
1/20/2016,"hello, i<U+FFFD>m sogor and i<U+FFFD>m announcing my intention to run for csm xi.i have been playing eve for the better part of a decade, and in that time i have attempted to experience most of of what new eden has to offer. i have tinkered with every aspect of industry, from t2/t3 production to planetary interaction. i<U+FFFD>ve lived and operated in every category of space; highsec, lowsec, j-space, npc null, sov null, i<U+FFFD>ve been through it all. i also participate in pvp daily, typically in small-fleet engagements but occasionally in larger fights as well. my varied experience in eve combined with my neutral stance and personal background would all make me an ideal csm candidate.who are you?in-game, i<U+FFFD>m currently a member of awayward inc., a smaller corporation currently focused on small-gang combat and nullsec operations. i joined with these guys about a month ago to fly with some old friends that i had met several years ago. before i joined them, i was a member of the independent operators consortium alliance and the mildly intoxicated alliance before that, formerly affiliated with the red menace coalition and n3 coalition respectively. in addition to alliance and coalition affiliations, i try to stay active in the broadcast 4 reps group and our little eve lgbt community. i think that groups like these that tie together people from every walk of eve are excellent, and (for b4r in particular) that they seem rather unique to eve itself.out-of-game i am a graduate student. i studying exploration geophysics with an emphasis on electromagnetic and potential field methods with application to mining and metals exploration. i<U+FFFD>ve had experience working with geological and environmental chemistry companies in the past, as well as on secured national nuclear sites, and i feel that the organizational and deductive skills i<U+FFFD>ve acquired over my academic career would be useful in the csm setting. additionally, one core tenant of science, though not always followed, is a sense of non-bias, which i also feel is important.why do i want to join the csm?eve online is the one game that i have consistently returned to over the years, a game that has managed to capture my attention enough that i can<U+FFFD>t imagine myself not playing it. the lore, gameplay, player interaction, and complexity are all facets of eve that i don<U+FFFD>t believe any other game has truly been able to replicate (and i<U+FFFD>ve tried looking, believe me). for me eve is a game that i try to get all of my friends to at give a shot, because i think that what this game offers is utterly unique. because of my interest in the game, and my desire to ensure that it continues being a quality experience for both new players and veterans alike. joining the csm and providing feedback on upcoming changes to ccp developers seems like an excellent way to do this.so, what have you done in eve exactly?as i mentioned before, i have experience in almost every aspect of eve. for the curious, here is a full list of things i<U+FFFD>ve done:highsec mining/industry/missions/explorationlowsec hunting/explorationplanetary interaction, from basic materials up to p4corporation leadership in highsec and j-spacet1/t2 production in highsec and nullt3 production in j-spacenullsec industry/productionblack ops hunting/dropping, small-gang to fleet pvp in null and lownull logistics, including jump freightering and market stockingpos management/logistics/reactionssmall-gang fcwhy would you be qualified to be on the csm?though recently my corporation joined test alliance in the past i have been heavily involved with much smaller operations. even now, my corporation is fairly small in scope, though we have a high percentage of veteran players. my familiarity with smaller entities in eve gives me a perspective that csm candidates that have pasts cemented as part of the large power blocs in eve may lack. additionally, my wide variety of experience in eve allows me to form an opinion on a wide variety of topics, though i<U+FFFD>m not unafraid to say whether or not i am informed enough about a particular topic to give a well developed response. this means that i will be able to look at suggestions to many different aspects of the game and be able to give meaningful input on most of them.my position as a scientist outside of eve should be indicative of my ability to provide a critical analyses and to effectively solve problems. the combination of my past and present experience in eve online, along with the skills that i<U+FFFD>ve acquired in my career and education, would make me an effective csm candidate able to sort through a variety of suggestions, ideas, and possible changes to determine which would be the most likely to change the game in a positive direction for the players.what ideas do you have?as a long time player there are a variety of areas in eve that i feel could use improvement, from potentially major game changes to a variety of smaller, quality of life improvements that could be applied to speed along different aspects of the game. some of the potential ideas i have include the following:pi interface: the interface for pi seems overly complex, and i think something like a <U+FFFD>routeall<U+FFFD> function would drastically decrease the amount of work it takes to set up some of the more complex setups, particularly where factory planets are involved. this would mean that there would be a button that would make factories connected to storage facilities and launchpads attempt to automatically intake the materials they need from storage to produce items."
1/20/2016,"cloaky camping: having spent my fair share of time in nullsec, i<U+FFFD>d say that there should be some sort of change to how easy it is to essentially shut down a system. it discourages active gameplay, from both the campers and the campee, as there is no effective way to remove a camper from space, nor is there a good way to continue activity in camped space. my initial thoughts would be to put a non-repeating cycle time on cloaks (to the tune of 30 minutes to an hour), or to create a way to track down cloaked vessels (though i hear this may be possible with citadels).group industry: right now it is difficult to organize large scale industrial projects. while the new industry interface is really great compared to the original one, it could use something in the way of project management. i believe ccp is already considering something like this, if the survey i took a while back was any indication. an interface that would allow groups to fill <U+FFFD>construction orders<U+FFFD> or something similar to this would help industrial organization, similar to filling buy orders in market places. for example, if building a carrier was split between different people, orders for different parts could be accepted by different corporation or alliance members, enabling larger amounts of organization.sovereignty value: as it stands, owning sovereignty in space gives a variety of strategic bonuses, but lends little to the value of the space. this is particularly true in areas with higher true security status, as even with infrastructure upgrades the space is lackluster. while there is a definite need for lower quality space to offer lower quality resources, it feels like activities, namely high-sec incursions, have the capability to generate much more isk for players than most, if not all, areas of nullsec. since null security space is the least crowded and is where the player narrative really shines, i think that more emphasis should be placed on rewarding alliances that take and hold their own sovereignty, which would further encourage players to migrate from high security space to the more dangerous sectors.highsec wardecs: one large problem with highsec wardecs is that there is a decided lack of participation in the wars by the defending party. instead of a mechanic that generates highsec pvp, instead it turns into a way for corporations to farm low risk kills from other players. one way to make this a more active mechanic is to change the bounty system to further incentivize hired defending corporations to participate in battles. this could be an increase on bounty rewards for wanted corporations and individuals, but this would have to be carefully adjusted to prevent wide scale fraud using alt characters. alternately, wardec costs could increase over time, instead of keeping the same flat rate week by week, and a <U+FFFD>truce period<U+FFFD> could be added to surrendering, setting a time period where a war cannot be redeclared by the aggressor for a time agreed on by both parties.another potential addition that may change the aspect of high security wardecs could be the addition of logistics ships on killmails. this is a change that many logistics pilots have been pushing for, and would change highsec wars because neutral logistics ships will be more easily identified. this change would allow corporations to better prepare for a fight; if neutral logistics pilots are accounted for beforehand then the playing field could be considered more <U+FFFD>level<U+FFFD>.off-grid links replacement: with changes to off-grid links coming down the line, it is important to both reduce their efficacy in every situation and take care not to nerf them too hard. in order to do this, links shouldn<U+FFFD>t be set to be effective on grids considering the new grid sizes. though the links ship would still be visible to hostile fleets, and therefore easily probed down, it would still largely be removed from combat. smaller fleets would still have trouble dealing with opposing links, and may just turn fights into chasing links around a battlefield. instead, i would suggest an aoe effect, with a skill or module that increases the range of the effect. this would require links ships to be on grid, and would likely phase out the dedicated links ships for those that are fit both for combat and boosting. a dedicated combat / boosting ship in a fleet would add an almost flagship like element to fleets using boosts.---i would note that a caveat to my suggestions is that i am neither a developer nor a programmer. i don<U+FFFD>t know what is conceivable to put into the game, but i do have a sense on what areas could be improved, and some ways that could improve them.conclusionmy experience in eve as well as my scientific background outside of the game give me attributes that make me qualified to sit on the csm. as i have exposure to such a wide array of topics within the game, i have the ability to review and suggest meaningful changes in a variety of areas, for example on mechanics such as cloaky camping and the planetary interaction interface. additionally, my past in smaller alliances and corporations gives me an extra perspective adds another point of consideration to my thoughts and decisions. if anyone has any questions feel free to contact me here, in-game, or on reddit at /u/sogorthefox. additionally, my primary non-professional email is sogortheogre@gmail.com if anyone would like to contact me there as well. thanks for reading!"

1/20/2016,"see, this one i really, really disagree with. i want to agree with it, as cloaky camping its terrible game play, but there's literally no way to actually harass people in null sec without cloaky camping them. nullsec is absurdly safe thanks to local, intel channels, derivative tools that use local and intel channels, distance, fewer wormholes to null, territory far away from were antagonists can resupply or escalate, and the ability for the defender to escalate infinitely. until there is a way to add some risk back to it, cloaky camping is really the only way to effectively antagonize sov residents; ess was a nice concept, but it has largely failed because people either do not use them or have rats to defend them, and the best thing to do when a neutral is either in your system, or a few jumps out is still simply to dock - avoidance. almost every ratting ship out there is capable of leaving a site and getting safe well before being at risk; 99% of the time it is not the hunter being good that gets someone caught in null, its the ratter being careless. game play where one side disproportionately holds every advantage possible is quite boring, i.e. there is still no good way for a roaming gang to cause trouble to the point where defending sov space actually matters. taking cloaky camping out of null would be like taking catalyst ganking out of high sec. both are literally the last tools available to antagonists, where every other outlet has been solved by the players or mitigated entirely by mechanics."
1/20/2016,"so, i grabbed kyle for a few questions, which he was kind enough to answer.behind the platforms: kyle aparthosedit: updated url."
1/20/2016,have to admit i like bradford. he was one of the.. maybe the only sane person i remember out of syj :-)brad knows his sh-t. good deal glad you are running.
1/21/2016,"an idea of mine was that ccp would make a story driven game within the eve universe, which leads the player to different places like amarr or jita. there the scenes of action would be inside the stations, on spaceships and the homeworlds of the factions. it should have a story wich is sad, depressive and leads at the end to the final decision of becoming a capsuleer or not. leaving the past behind and start a new life as an immortal or whatever creative ccp comes up with.eventually some parts of this game can then be ported or somehow made usable in eve itself.docking and walking on (abandoned) stations for some exploration stuff, alone or with friends, as mentioned in the post above, for example.here eve would benefit of maps and game engines which then are already existing. it also has the advantage that development costs can be split between different games."
1/21/2016,"as someone who's played in all areas of the game, and gotten to know the mindsets of those attracted to the various enterprises available here, i can resoundingly not support this idea.there is no question of ""if"" the players of this game would nuke vast regions just for giggles, merely a matter of how long it'd take them to get the logistics of the nuking in place. the planning would start the instant such an idea was released to the population, and the time to execution would simply be a matter of construction and travel."
1/21/2016,"why dont do that?everbody like eve, graphics, music, possiblities, etc..i love eve, the space, the ships, sometimes i stay hours just looking for nothing, or exploring...i think a lot of players will come to eve, i have 3 friends like me, but they hate pvp else.well, is just a simple suggestion, i think a lot of other people alredy said that!thanks ans sorry if is in wrong forum and for my language errors."
1/21/2016,"ecm is always going to be a tricky mechanic to balance since it its rng based and its effectiveness scales heavily the smaller the fight gets, unlike other forms of ewar (like damps) which can still be consistently effective in large fights and small fights.in an ideal world, i would love to see caldari get a completely new ewar scheme, maybe with an anti-drone flavor, but if that is not up for discussion in terms of ccp's roadmap, i would like to see eccm as a counter get a bit improved, since right now, even overheated eccm battleships can be consistently jammed by t1 frigs, for example. this could involve a numbers rebalancing, or even adding some new mechanic like ships that are jammed with an eccm active can still target the jam source."
1/21/2016,friendly post to move back to front page. also blog seems to be having some issues. hopefully should be resolve soon from my host provider. will be making new blog post when it's back up.
1/21/2016,see my campaign thread from last year. the people i am campaigning for are (more or less) the people that do not know the csm exists... and won't vote anyway. high sec carebears... can't live with them... can't live without them.and once again... i would like to see numbers. how many is many? is it a majority?
1/21/2016,well... i do not think you are off base. but wealth distribution in eve is a big subject... high sec incursions are theoretically available to all... null sec ratting not necessarily...
1/21/2016,"i have flown with brodit for a long time (did i recruit you?) - until i recently left for a life as a mercenary. brodit is a solid, calm, knowledgable guy with a great sense of humor. i have no problem endorsing brodit as csm candidate - to stand as wh representative for the ""lower"" holes, stand as industry representative for the self made guys and stand as a representative for all of us for whom this game is just that - a game and not a second job or power trip to compensate for a failed career. brodit will diligently listen to our questions and with scottish pigheadedness seek answers from the community and ccp. brodit for csm despite that we don't deserve him."
1/21/2016,"by your justification any corporation who is 'blue' status to any other corp, alliance etc. clearly is nothing more than a puppet state of the other. if you fail to see how ignorant this argument is then there is nothing more i can say because you are hiding behind a blanket argument. by your argument clearly we should just disband nato on the basis it's pathetic countries aren't willing to protect themselves alone against all.it is not my interest or responsibility to argue your view of the imperium. however if you don't believe coalitions are just a natural cause of game mechanics i will give you a map. again. the imperium is not the first, only, or last coalition new eden will see. to ignore or destroy all coalition gameplay would be no less intrusive than destroying all pvp from low sec. i take all forms of gameplay into consideration.i would also like to point out that my alliance the bastion has never deployed to cloud ring so your interpretation of what every alliance in the coalition is doing is clearly non-factual. you will notice i am not running for the 'null sec' candidate nor am i running for the 'wormhole' candidate. for that matter not the 'industrial', 'high sec' candidate or anywhere else where i have active characters. i am running for the people of new eden as sullen decimus. last time i checked i'm not getting paid by anyone in game. i will be supported by several, but do not think for a second i am 'controlled' by anyone."
1/21/2016,"not at all. plenty of blues are not only justified, but good game play. it comes down to what you gain from a blue, and what it costs you. is it really worth being blue to the largest, by a considerable factor, collation in the game? are they really going to make your space safer? are you getting more content out of it than it is costing you? look what's happening to sma right now. it will be your turn soon enough. legitimate blue relationships are based on mutual respect. no one respects pet alliances of the cfc, it's plainly obvious for what purpose they exist, and it isn't because the cfc values you highly.easy to be deceived by pictures. take a look at actual numbers of people involved in these coalitions, and get back to me; comparing the scrappy and fun-loving coaltions of the south to the bloated and disgusting ones in the north is....well just that, night and day. like most things, in and of themselves, coalitions are not intrinsically bad, but taken the the extremes of size like the cfc, they really just cause stagnation. so? if an entity whom i was blue with did something sufficiently dishonorable, despicable, or unsportsmanlike, i would re-evaluate that relationship. that you haven't is basically tacitly approving their ways, either that or you are just too sheepish or you value your ratting and srp more highly than content. the csm needs leaders, players, and thinkers. as part of a pet alliance, i question your ability to lead - you know how to follow for sure. as a member of a pet alliance, i question your ability to play - you know how to work for someone else. finally, as a member of a pet alliance, i question your ability to think for yourself."
1/21/2016,i question every argument you make considering you were a member of the exact corp and coalition you have been berating not once but twice.
1/21/2016,"i endorse this product or service.also, he's about 50% less douchy than you think. as a fact i know that he mines in hs, runs missions (not often), operates in wh space, and is part of the cfc (imperium) nullsec bloc. pretty much, if it requires autism. he's in.*edit - you need to learn not to copy the whole ******* thread above you man."

1/21/2016,i have played with judge for quite awhile now. i have come to know him as a very reliable and trustworthy person. he is always willing to listen to you and discuss things. even after a big discussion he will smile on you and shake hands. he works hard to get where he wants to be. i think he would make a great csm member.the judge for csm
1/21/2016,you are a joke.
1/21/2016,do you care to elaborate on that statement or are you truly so mindless a goon?
1/21/2016,"utari does well to note his real life job.professional is what he has been and ""professional"" is the best descriptor i have for how i would expect him to handle the responsibilities of being a csm member. responsibilities being both to the csm and to those who elected him."
1/21/2016,i approve of and my support is given to this candidate.
1/21/2016,"okay, let's start off with some basics here.how do you feel about being a cfc pet, and thereby willfully contributing to the stagnation of nullsec?have you ever been part of an alliance that was strong and independent, or do you think monolithic mega-colations are good for the game?this is a huge negative. every click you give to mittens isn't for the game, it's for his wallet, not to mention the dubious quality of the highly opinionated propaganda and drivel that is hosted there. tmc is literally one of the most unfair and unbalanced media outlets i can think of - period. coverage is hilariously tilted and focused only on goons, what goons do, and how to be a good goon, or how a game change affects goons, towing the party like of their e-relevance. so much happens in new eden on a daily basis, so many stories, and somehow all the coverage is goon-related...yeah that's propaganda. there simply cannot be eve news if its not about goons! willingly aiding and abetting a media empire as crooked as tmc is not only morally questionable, but it may also be rather illegal to do as csm candidate - surely someone who wants to be a candidate has read the rules, or do you think your mittani-graced, goon-sent self is above that?tmc is absolutely another gaming media outlet. what do you have to say about the fact that you may be ineligible for csm? some would say that you are merely a yes man of the imperium, and when you say reacted to the changes to eve, you simply mean fighting those changes all the way to preserve the status quo. basically, i think you are hilariously duplicitous and two faced. on one hand....so you tacitly admit that super blobs are a bad thing that prevents good sov game play, but then on reddit freely admit that.."
1/21/2016,"aegissov already did all of these things, but the cfc would not tolerate it this year, nor will they tolerate it next year regardless of what changes. let me now tell a story of cloud ring...a new age dawned with aegissov, with no region better poised to benefit from it than cloud ring. fweddit and ph, as well as other alliances eyed it as the new region to live in, as it was geographically and culturally poised to be full of content and pvp activity. bordering fountain, syndicate, and black rise, gangs could come in from far and wide and bask in the spectacle of battle, were alliance logistics were simple and easy thanks to proximity to high sec and jita. each constellation was owned by a different alliance, existing as living proof aegis sov could work for small alliances, and foster the sort of game play it was designed to do; content ring was born. it's residents enjoyed months of sov being just that, engaging and fun for everyone involved. the cfc could not tolerate this. not culturally, not politically, and it clashes with their narrative of aegissov. content ring was promptly burned to the ground; what used to be a thriving, vibrant microcosm of aegissov at its best was reduced to cinder and ash. while you and other cfc people may point to mechanics, or stall with other rationales, at the end of the day it doesn't matter what mechanics there are, you don't want fun mechanics, and you don't want other people having fun with sov. acting like you do just reveals how duplicitous you are about the whole thing. you and your leadership have already made their decisions, and assigned blame, but people can see how cheap a facade this really is. no mechanics change is ever going to be capable of fixing sov for the cfc, as the main problem is not the mechanics, it is the cfc."
1/21/2016,"who?i am a casual eve player with a loud voice and i have basically touched every aspect of the eve experience.why would anyone, ever, anywhere, for any reason vote for a casual?because casuals exist, and furthermore many choose to be casuals for one important reason that needs to change:min-maxing skillpoints inevitably leads to players afking in high-sec rather than having fun with their friends.this is my entire purpose for seeking a csm position is to be the voice for the skillpoint minmaxing crowd.so you have a cause, but do you have a solution?my solution is for ccp to offer attribute boosters in the same 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 classes that do not stack with implants, these would have a 24 hour duration, can be reapplied early, and persist through death.siting afk in high-sec in +5s is great for going on vacation, but these attribute boosters would remove any perceived benefit to staying in high-sec.concede to succeedfinally i am willing to concede and endorse another candidate with a greater chance of winning if they hold the same values, if i don't need to win the popularity contest to see the needed changes make it to tranquility, so much the better."
1/21/2016,"i am officially announcing my candidacy for csm xi.i have played eve for roughly a year, so while i may not be the most experienced candidate running, i feel that i may bring more of a newbro perspective to the csm. i am an industrialist, and have worked both high sec and null sec.following are a few of the things i would like to see happen.1) i would like to see some new battlecruisers and battleships enter the tech trees, to offset the increase in frigate and destroyer class ships. perhaps bcs and bss that are specialized in tracking smaller ships.2) either a new bs sized mining vessel, perhaps a tech 3 version so as not to replace exumers.3) the possibility of giving the rorqual a new role, of being able to mine itself. perhaps having the option to either have the industrial core or an extraction ""core"", giving the rorqual the ability to mine with 6-7 strip miners. as it is now the rorqual just sits in a pos providing boosts, with its compression ability not being used generally. it would also get the rorqual out from sitting in a pos.4) i would like to see some changes to the wardec system. as it stands now anyone can declare war on anyone and have no limit to how many wardecs are active. perhaps limit the number of active wardecs a corp or alliance can have at any one time, or increase the cost to wardec someone, while also adjust the cost based on the size of the corp or alliance being wardec'd. so for example, a small corp, say 1-10 members will cost more then a corp with 50 members, then at a certain point it would cost more again for larger corps. then each concurrent wardec will cost more, for example if you have 5 wardecs active, if you declare war again it will cost 5x more isk.thank you for taking the time to read this, vote terandria starsong for csm.send an eve mail, i would love to hear your opinions, ideas, and feedback.o7 fly safe"
1/21/2016,"a couple questions:if you increase mining yields with a new ship, or new bonuses, what will prevent the increased amount of ore from tanking the markets? wouldn't this then hurt new and casual miners who do not have access to these increased yields?it would seem to me if you released a mining ship that was so much better than the current crop, you would obsolete the current ships making it mandatory for any serious miner to fly the new ship. would there be any tradeoffs for your super-miner so that players would still want to fly the current barges and exhumers?if corporations are limited to the number of wars they can declare, either by scaling cost or a hard limit, how would mercenary corps function? how could you profitably declare war on targets for your clients if you can only have a couple wars ongoing at a time?and while i get the rationale for scaling the costs of a war inversely to the size of the corp, doesn't that provide a disincentive for corps to get larger? it would seem to me to encourage players to stay in small, and one-man corps for the protection offered by increased war costs, and thus out of the larger corps that are more likely to have a rich social experience that ccp has said keep people subscribed to the game. and if you did scale it like that, shouldn't a small corp be able to declare war on another small corp without increased costs?best of luck on your csm run."
1/21/2016,"black pedro, i appreciate the questions. to answer the first, a new mining ship or role for the rorqual would definitely have tradeoffs, i am thinking something along the lines of a siege or bastion type module, in that you can mine more at once, but you are stuck in place until the completion of the cycle. thus for the greatly increased yield, you put your ship in a more dangerous position. but again with having it on a larger ship, your tank is better which in turn helps with survivability. so barges/exhumers would definitely keep their place and not be rendered obsolete, as they are still mobile while mining. another idea would be to had a tech 3 mining ship, where you have module choices similar to the strategic cruisers. a ship such as this would simply be another tier in progression.to answer your second question, i feel that having a limit or cost increases would make corps and alliances choose targets and have to put thought into it, instead of blanket wardecs. such a system i feel would be more beneficial to all involved. additionally i'm not thinking being able to only have 2-3 wars going at once, i'm thinking more then that, but i also think that having 100+ wars active at once (which i have seen before) is a bit excessive. again though, i appreciate your questions, thank you."
1/21/2016,i have updated my post expanding on my personal views :)
1/21/2016,"lex is my vote for csm and not because he is my alliance ceo, he logs in and leads us, he comes up with new doctrines for us to fly and generally knows what he is talking about. lex is the one who drives our entire alliance and the blues we ally with and not some name behind it all, so that gets my vote."
1/22/2016,"gevlon stated that, if elected, he had no intention to contribute anything to the csm. he can do that just fine without running for csm."
1/22/2016,"hello,not sure were to post this but can you sell supers with your toon? per rules say sell them on open market you can't exactly dock these things.... and i don't have to trust anyone in the game so?"
1/22/2016,"no, you are not able to sell any assets with your character during a character sale (the exception being plugged in implants, which can be stated). people tend to sell supers using reliable and trusted third parties, like chribba or grendell, which have a fee to use."
1/22/2016,"you apparently don't understand the concept of a sandbox as it relates to video gaming.you can do pretty much anything you want in a sandbox, including kicking over the castles being made by others playing in the sandbox.your suggestion is contrary to the very core of eve online."
1/22/2016,"this comes up often and i'm going to lock this down before you get flamed. the poster above me is correct in saying that this is a true sandbox game where you can build and destroy sandcastles.i encourage you to give pvp a try at the very least. i came to eve with a poor view of pvp as well that came from my experiences with pvp from other games. as it turns out, i found pvp in eve to be quite thrilling. i especially enjoy that no two pvp fights end up the same way, and people are constantly iterating and finding new ways to try to gain an edge. that being said, you can also spend your time away from pvp but you can't avoid it completely unless you never leave a station."
1/22/2016,"so, i grabbed joffy, who kindly answered a few questions for me. interview here"
1/22/2016,100% of competent industrial players.
1/22/2016,"again, that is the point. if a lucrative and safe income source like incursions is ""available to all"" in highsec, why would any individual or small group leave? i mean i am well aware how much isk nullsec grinders put into the economy (largely via afk ratting, which i also think is a major problem), but for the individual weighing her options, the fully optimized incursions we have today pay a higher isk/hr than nullsec anomalies and come with no risk and little downtime. i am harping on this because while some parts of your campaign were a little naive, i placed you quite highly on the ballot last year. highsec players (of which i am largely one) need representation, and you presented yourself as a thoughtful and intelligent candidate. you even demonstrated an understanding of the importance risk vs. reward for the overall health of the game by providing incentive for players to assume the risks outside of highsec, in exchange for increased reward.it is important for me to vote for someone whose interested in the overall balance of the game, rather than csm members who just advocate for changes that directly benefit them and their constituency. like mike azariah who unabashedly pushed for the incursion income faucet to be cranked open even more (csm 9 summer minutes) and ccp listened, further exacerbating the distorting effects of this income on the economy that ccp quant pointed out in the devblog i linked above. therefore, i am asking you directly, what type of csm member are you going to be? do you think highsec incursions are working well in their current form? do you support the removal of the min-maxed sansha incursions and their replacement with the more dynamic and difficult drifter incursions or will you be more of a mike azariah successor and not support that because it will ""ruin someone's fun""? do you think the status quo of a few percent of the players getting so much of the resources generated into the economy each month should be allowed to continue?"
1/22/2016,"what type of csm member would i be? good question.i am in favor of dynamism, as it were. not just in concord response times, but actually overall. in general i think the game could do with more random... but i also accept that many of the ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" ideas that i have will stand exactly zero (or less) chance of getting implemented (or even thought about getting implemented) by ccp. as a member of the csm my main focus would not be on getting my ideas implemented, i expect.i do not intend to actively advocate ""automatic money printing"", whatever the means, because such things damage us all.no i do not think that."
1/22/2016,"well, i read the entire thread, including vic jefferson trying to derail the thread and his thinly veiled attempts to call your candicacy into question. i was somewhat impressed by your replies to his sniping.im not voting, but if any of you out there are, you could do a lot worse than cast your vote for this guy."

1/22/2016,thank again for all you guys do! was an excellent interview with awesome editing despite my mic cutting out in the beginning.
1/22/2016,"i read your whole thread.ive read other threads that made my teeth itch, yours however didnt make them itch all the time.the only problem i have with you as a candidate is your propensity for going into other candidates threads and bashing thier positions. its low and too close to how real politicians operate. if i was voting i would vote for someone more interested in eve, than being the person with the best sound bite or wittiest retort. let your own position stand as evidence of your ability to get the job done at csm."
1/22/2016,"in an ideal world yeah, the candidate with the best positions and who is most interested in eve would win. sadly, the current state of the csm is actually very close to real politicians another way, namely that popularity, backing, and visibility have more to do with it than the raw strength of the platforms. at least here, ideas are given the time to collide in what sometimes progresses and elevates the discourse between two candidates.while you may brush it off as bashing, i tend to view it as opportunities. patience, and communicating with everyone, not just those of your chosen play style, is important. it takes a truly skilled person to convince someone to respect an opinion they do not agree with, and see no value in."

1/22/2016,just listened to my interview in entirety. you guys do an awesome job and it's great to have individuals willing to donate their time like this.
1/22/2016,"i have worked (in eve) with utari as both his commanding officer in pie, and as another retainer for senior captain laerise in the amarr championships.charles surge hit the nail on the head when he emphasized ""professional"". both as a a junior fc for our alliance and as a team mate during the champiionships, utari often had very different ideas than i did. he always made his opinion clear, and always made sure his reasoning was sound. definitely passionate (i wanted to say zealous, but people other than me usually see that as a negative) about his goals, but always capable of seeing other ways to achieve that goal. i do call bulls*** on not serving content on a aplate for people though. as while he might not be under duress to create the content, i never saw him log in and take a back seat waiting for content. he always jumped in and got the ball rolling without being asked. utari, i suppose your point was that you wont have to split commitments, so i'd have to agree there.admiral of pie inc., praetoria imperialis excubitoris (see 'pie public' for recruitment)"

1/22/2016,as a fellow csm xi candidate i would just like to say i have read your forum and i appreciate your professionalism. you also brought to the front the key problems in several aspects. i think you would be an excellent pic for csm xi and wish you best of luck on your continued campaign.
1/22/2016,"not at all. basically what i said is that it is completely daffy to wish for or seek a mechanical solution to a social problem. when aegissov was working, quite well in fact, the cfc hated it and continued stewing and bemoaning about how bad it was and the lack of content opportunities it gave, while other smaller alliances rejoiced and celebrated new eden style by indulging in unadulterated pew. i realize that several of my critics have placed me entirely into a pvp labeled box, but war means business; functionally working aegissov means more abundant and more accessible industry for all.none of the 'pet' candidates have come up with a response to why burning cloud ring was a good idea. none of the 'pet' candidates have even attempted to address what is legitimate criticism of their reception of aegissov vs the reception it had among other entities.i would rather willfully handicap my chances to have a legitimate chance at fun, than embrace the permanent stasis that the coalitions have sold to it's members. we have seen where this goes for years. we know who speaks for the coalitions, who then speaks for the players?"
1/22/2016,"who am i in game?i am a proud gallentean pilot. a late bloomer who started in 2010. after running some training missions, and a few epic arc missions, i joined the corporation terra firma explorations ltd. and begun mining in high-sec with a t1 hauler. these guys taught me a lot about eve and really got me set up in understanding our game.after a few great months, i needed to find a group that was more suited to my style, i wanted to shoot things!after seeing the skull and crossbones of i n e x t r e m i s, i looked no further. a fresh corp, just formed by a fellow aussie, and looking to wreak havoc across new eden. after only 5 months in game, i found myself in a rapidly growing pvp corporation, with one of our first engagements earning me the title . our corporation is a member of the tactical narcotics team alliance, which is a member of the imperium coalition. we have lived in multiple null sec regions and have engaged in pvp and all parts of new eden. null-sec, low-sec, high-sec, wormhole space, there is no place we won't fight. our corporation has earned the title of top killers in every alliance we have been a member of. i may not be the strongest of pvp-ers, but that doesn't mean i'll back away from a fight. win or loose, it's the thrill of the fight!loyalty is an important aspect of the game. 5 years on, i am one of the longest standing members of itai, and have the unofficial title of co-ceo. our corporation has over 200 members, of which i know every member, and treat them as family. we are a world-wide corp that operates 23.5/7, and i have the privilege of flying with some amazing men and women, from so many different cultural backgrounds, that all share a laugh and that support and care for one another.who am i in real life?i am a 30-something west australian, graphic designer and musician. the last person you'd expect to be playing an online spaceship computer game if you met me at the pub. we don't have pet kangaroos, but i can handle a mouse pretty well. i grew up around computers and computer games. from beyond dark castle on a mac lc iii to dayz (arma2 mod!) on my current system, i have always enjoyed gaming. a friend of mine (also a gamer/musician) who knew of my interest in sci-fi and technology, lead me towards eve online,though it was the social aspect of eve that kept me playing. multiplayer games are one thing, eve is another. i have attended eve down under twice as well as other player gatherings in australia, and have always enjoyed talkingabout the game with others, sharing stories, sharing ideas and sharing speculations on upcoming features. i might not be the loudest one in the room, but that's usually because i'm thinking, planning or daydreaming.csm and the csm is something i've heard about, but never put any serious consideration into. like a lottery where your chances of winning get slimmer with every entrant. but its common knowledge, you can't win it, if your not in it. so just like #yolo-ing a freighter through a gate, i am announcing my candidacy for csm xi. with my graphic design and music comes the skills of communication, planning, understanding and knowing what the best outcome for the overall project, which i feel are skills that make me an ideal candidate. eve online has had a huge impact on me and i want to support the game and continue to see it grow and evolve.as a member of the csm i want to share the voice of the players. i want to find out what drives the players in the game and what aspects they want to see expand. i feel there is a great deal that can be done to make this game even greater. for me, it's the visual layout and user experience, which i believe there are many ways they can make game more inviting to newer players, while maintaining the intellect and integrity of the game. i feel like i can take the ideas and feedback of players both new and old present them in a professional manner to ccp.things i want to advocate for:corporation leadership/managementui/uxnew-player experiencenull-sec pvpfeel free to shoot me an in-game mail or just shoot me in-game, i will shoot back!"
1/22/2016,eve-nt interview available here:
1/22/2016,"is an awesome guy, everyone vote for him because he really deserves it :d"
1/22/2016,go !
1/22/2016,"short, sweet, and i am running for candidacy because i have no bias.i do not know jack diddly **** about anything game play wise. i do specialize in figuring things out though. i have never flown a capital class ship, or a super, or a titan. although that goes without saying if i have not flown a regular cap.i'm prettyyyy bad at the game. but i learn. i primarily am involved in flying logi in small fleets (sub 100 people, small time experience with being in fleets where caps are fielded).i speak for the new beans.the know it nothings.i can't leak because i have no friends and i don't **** post.ask me anything."
1/23/2016,"as much as it pains me to say it, this is not civilisation ii"
1/23/2016,"mountains! bridges! \o/""x up"", vote xenuria!it's gonna be huge!"
1/23/2016,"there is a lot i like in here i must agree.but...there is always a but :)high sec shouldn't be safer, bumping is fine as it is. i can agree with that. the trouble i see is that high sec ganking is indeed a very low skill pvp. but when i see the people doing it they surely aint all low pvp skilled people.my guess is that the high sec ganking is a sign of boredom of the player base. how can one really say its exiting to sit to kill a ship that will not defend and mostly is even at ap? so not against the principle of ganking but think we need more (player driven) content in all secs to make live more interesting then shooting for 30 secs at a ship that flows in space. low sec should be more dangerous and zero even more....i am afraid that there are more care bears today there then in high sec:pand then we can still kill a freighter or two in high sec to sharpen skills or have something to do when we are so drun^&', i mean distracted, that we better not fight a titan in low/zero :)regards,space"
1/23/2016,"i personally make a lot of my isk through ganking, though i know there are also a lot of players that do it for fun over profits. i don't think it has as much to do with boredom as it has to do with less options to engage with other pilots in highsec, so some may choose ganking. i'm always in favour of more content. i think that lowsec being more dangerous than highsec and nullsec being more dangerous than lowsec makes sense, but if a pve pilot is considering leaving highsec, they may as well move to nullsec or wormholes, because the risk of being killed is pretty much the same as lowsec but the payout is higher."
1/23/2016,"more player-created content in high sec? wasn't it important to get people out of high sec into areas of space where they can live out their visions and create their empires? so, what is it now?"
1/23/2016,the vid is nice :) you gotta love the frogs
1/23/2016,"high sec content again. was it not the ideal to make people move out of high sec? so, shouldn't high sec become more boring, less interesting and instead more interesting, new mechanics and fun should be added to low sec/npc null sec and null sec?"
1/23/2016,"thanks for the responses, and i would agree that much of it seems quite reasonable.good luck with your campaign"
1/23/2016,"two very important questions before i seriously can consider voting for you:- do you have a titan,- will you do a progod with it?and one silly:- the past csm's have shown that people with an agenda are unlikely to push through that agenda. though your agenda sounds nice, and ccp seems to be on some of the same pages, you're unlikely to get the chance to actually push your list through any congress-like ""csm committee"". in the likely instance where ccp is focusing on stuff that isn't on your list, and ignores any attempt of yours' to bring up your list, who could you see going to for more indepth advice about specific playstyles, problems or areas?in short, where would you go look for your experts and constituents?"
1/23/2016,"no, i had a super for awhile, but that was terrible and i hated it so i sold it. while the csm does have ccp's ear to a certain degree, it is much more about ccp bouncing ideas off them than the csm bouncing ideas off ccp. now while i have a pretty good grasp on how to nullsec (plus, i know a few guys who do even better) things like fw and wh's i would want to reach out as much as i am allowed to in order to better respond to ccp's presentations. like dng for fw, or some of the quasernocks guys for the latest in wh life. i feel like it really depends on what ccp is having the csm examine at that point in time. i'm trying to be an all around candidate that people feel comfortable just firing questions or opinions at. so for a short answer, i know where the experts are, but constitutions are gonna have to come to me with their input."
1/23/2016,"actually what i have learned in the past two years after leaving was what made me a better player. being in pl and learning from doomchinchilla/ overload everything. made me grow more as a player and a leader. i take syj as my main wormhole experience because it was back when syj was running smoothly. honestly pell was/is a good person just mistaken for a crazy guy. it honestly was a fun time playing with them. i don't like giving up on something even when it dies... but realize now that once something dies its best to let it rest then keep trying to resurrect it :)join : bradford's 3rd party channel for all third party services, and check out my thread."
1/23/2016,"hi everyone, my name is mouse. you can call me mouse. i got ""lovingly"" told to run for csm xi because i ""look so innocent. i tried to explain that i'm a cold harded killer, with a taste for blood and whisky, but it fell on deaf ears. my original plan was the trump approach to this thing, but eventually decided running a platform based on building a wall around highsec wasn't the best idea, though it could make for some interesting changes to the low/null sec market, but that's for another time. so, without further fillerbusting, i'll present my platform, along with a small snippet about each. stay with me here, as you take a ride on mr. mouse's rollercoaster of emotion.i'm open to answering any questions you have, on here, or in eve-mail. you can ask me pretty much anything and i'll get around to answering it (i know a lot of shaggy dog stories and corny jokes). maybe.roast me,<3 mousep.s. the average north american antelope can jump higher than the average house. this is due in part to the antelopes powerful hind legs, and the fact that the average house can't jump."

1/24/2016,"didn<U+FFFD>t read, lol, vote for erika mizune!but in all seriousness: great seeing you candidate again. as last time, very good points that i hope you will be able to implement into the game.you have my vote!"
1/24/2016,"i recorded my csmwatch interview yesterday, i'll update the op with it when it comes out."
1/24/2016,"now available, the interview recorded by csm watch for our csm 11 election coverage: apothne's interviewenjoy !"
1/24/2016,"thing is, those few percent have made the investment to secure those resources. the rest of us have the ability to take the resources for ourselves."
1/24/2016,"of this i am glad. i have one final question for you. the latest minor controversy du jour is over the impact of the new skill extractors and the ability to trade skill points that will be implemented next month. what are your thoughts on this change to the game? do you think the ability to trade skill points is a good idea from the perspective of a highsec resident? are there any unforseen side-effects, or negative consequences that you are concerned about, and if so, do you have any ideas on how to mitigate those effects?"
1/24/2016,"sorry, i agree with you that it is important to get more people out of highsec, but making highsec more boring to do so isn't the answer. i think that new players that enter the game should be presented with a swath of exciting mechanics and career paths that start in highsec. it's supposed to entice them into playing long enough to train skills and learn about the risks and opportunities that lay outside highsec. sure, there are newbro corps for nullsec blocs that are pulling in week old players regularly to go out and join them, but a lot of players just aren't aware of it, or aren't interested."
1/24/2016,"you do not need to remove anything from high sec to make it more boring and less interesting than low sec/null sec as long as you add new things only to these areas. as long as ccp adds every single new mechanic of the game also to high sec, there will never be a drag pulling on players in high sec to venture out of the safer space to find new things to do, experience unknown mechanics and be able to use something that add activities/opportunities to your portfolio instead of mere small iterations on already known activities.in my opinion, space lacks distinguishing characteristics, something that you can look forward to when you want to move on to other areas of space. for instance, when i want to have boring isk grind there is virtually no difference between l4 running in high sec and anomaly running in most null sec areas. just a thought, but what is your opinion on freezing content additions to high sec and concentrate on other areas of space instead?"
1/24/2016,"sorry, i noticed that you also posted in vic jefferson's thread stating:that's where i got the impression you felt highsec needed to be more boring. it's not that i don't want to see more additions outside of highsec, i'm just making my platform and suggestions based off of my experience and knowledge. i'm totally in favour of space having distinguishing characteristics and offering different benefits and gameplay. there should be a better balance of risk vs reward, and thus operating outside of highsec should have greater rewards and different fun activities. you can make tons of isk from incursions consistently with little risk too, which is obviously something that needs some reworking. i'm not on board with freezing content additions for highsec because, in my opinion, highsec still needs to improve upon its current pvp mechanics amongst other things. that aside, nullsec seems to be the main focus for ccp for the next little while anyways."
1/24/2016,"i am at least 90% a low and null sec candidate. wherever people will play, the opposite side of play, the antagonist side, should be viable - such is what makes eve, eve. more and better ways to generate content in hi sec is for everyone's benefit. to be fair, finding new content for sov-null is a challenge; they are rather inventive and, in my appraisal, don't want it. they solved the siphons with the api malarkey, and theoretically the time in to fix this wont' be put in because pos are being phased out soon anyway. they solved the ess with placing them in fully spawned anoms, and theoretically they don't want to put the time into fix this because they are working on revamping rats in their entirety. aegissov worked in the areas that it was geographically favored to, like cloud ring. big ticket null solved that too. you can give tools to make sov-null play ball, but if they aren't interested in content, no tool will make them participate.that being said i have the opposite appraisal of npc null residents. i don't know how much i can possibly beat the dead horse that is syndicate, but, let's see. so in sept 2015, syndicate produced .18t isk worth of stuff, and destroyed .50t. this screams a few things; it's one of the few regions that destroys a significantly larger amount than it creates, and for having basically zero good ways to earn income locally, there is a surprising amount of conflict there. imagine if npc null had stable income streams so living there was actually viable for people? people want to live where they control their own content, can find risk and reward around the corner, and where the hassles of empire space don't inhibit game play. more, better, and more accessible income streams in npc null would empower 'right sized' groups to live there and live the small gang dream. i daresay the majority of people that have left syndicate based entities have done so for financial reasons, and no matter which group you talk to, sourcing income is the hardest part of living there. there is a player demand for that playstyle, but it is supported less than hi sec. give low and npc null residents content seeds and income, and content flourishes. give every single tool to empire creators who don't want content, and we see the result."
1/24/2016,short little conversation on tweetslack about what to expect during your interview.
1/24/2016,"announcing my candidacy for csm!platform:make hi-sec ""hi-sec"" again and reduce/reverse the trend towards ""safe-sec""... i would be in favor of doing some things like:reducing concord to effectively faction police! no more magical scram/web and superweapons. let them respond, just less effectively or just merge them and their response duties into faction police.make npc corps a part of faction warfare! give new accounts 30 days of being not a part of faction warfare then after that anytime they have a character in an npc corp that character is in faction warfare. leave out the standings penalties for faction warfare for non-militia npc corps but allow them to be engaged by other pilots in opposing faction warfare/npc corps... in my opinion this would give an extra reason to join/form corps and make for a more interesting game.let wardecs follow characters from dissolved corps or who drop from an involved corp for the remainder of the wardec or up to 7 days whichever is longer!change the bounty system! payout up to 100% of the kill value of the bounty on a given kill! add a small percentage killright, like 10% of the character's bounty, to any character with a bounty so ""bounty hunters"" can directly take a stab at getting that juicy bounty etc. the bounty kill right fee would pay down some of the bounty, directly to the person placing the bounty, if no bounty is collected while the kill right was active. make the bounty system worthwhile and more effective.as a rule of thumb i'm generally against any form of nerfing the game. the unsafe gritty sandbox nature of eve is it's biggest attraction and nerfing it so some can make easier isk detracts from the attraction in my opinion. don't like being ganked? learn not to burn, make friends to help protect you and grow some in the game instead of demanding nerfs to make the playground safer for wusses who would want to solo the mmorpg."

1/25/2016,"just yesterday i had the pleasure of interviewing mr hyde for the csm watch coverage. the interview isn't up yet, but i can honestly say it was one of the better ones i've participated in and i think he's on my ballot now."
1/25/2016,"so, xenuria agreed to answer some questions for me, for which i would like to thank him.behind the platforms - xenuria"
1/25/2016,"i don't know if you are taking medication or i am starting to be in need of them but if you keep putting out posts like this one then i think you may well win some genuine votes to your side.seeing as how i rather vividly remember one of your strange youtube videos, here is a multi-part curve ball question with a central theme (do try and hit it out of the park, please): how do you think eve players in general would react to unisex / cross dressing for their characters. how do you think they would react to pink ships? do you think that walking in stations and other ""barbie doll"" development would attract more females to the game? do you think that ccp will ever pick up wis and run with it again, such as integrating dust social areas into stations or even implement a few things smaller like inviting a friend or two to your captain's quarters? do you think that ccp would ever make an overt stand for lgbt (assuming budget and staff are available) and implement the cosmetics in the above questions?"
1/25/2016,"in my opinion, the best way to make it more enticing to leave highsec is to make people feel more connected to nullsec. i can wander around highsec all day every day and never know that nullsec exists unless local chat goes to it. if you start up a new account, make a character, and jump into the game without reading lore and all the rest first, you're dropped into highsec with little understanding of the existence of nullsec and the non-empire politics going on out there.so how to draw players' attention to leaving empire? build it into the lore. it should be in agent dialogs and corporation descriptions and on billboards and so on. find ways to present the notion of leaving the relative safety to find your fortune. make it feel like a gold rush into the wild west."
1/25/2016,"you're a member of the only ustz group that went ""all-in"" with aegis sov. i'd like to hear your perspective on the sov revamp in that context, particularly how it has (or hasn't) affected your day-to-day, and whether there are any changes you'd advocate for."
1/25/2016,"i wouldn't say it would take cloaky camping out of the equation - just that whomever is doing it has to be at the keyboard once per hour. this doesn't remove the idea of cloaky camping, it just forces a player who wants to do it to actually be active; a few second window once per hour shouldn't be enough to catch a cloaky scout who is actually watching his screen. i don't think miners should be able to mine constantly without any interaction, why should someone be able to do the same with cloaky camping? i do agree that nullsec is probably a bit too safe, but i don't think that enabling a mechanic where one person can effectively shut down a system by not actually doing anything isn't the correct answer. even now, if there is a cloaky camper in a system i'll either go to a different area or do something with ships i don't care about... i don't think this is an engaging mechanic on either side of the board.i do agree that there needs to be more options available to catalyze interactions between different groups, and that current mechanics designed to create content don't appear to be successful (as you mentioned with esses, few people seem to use them that i've seen, and those that do hide them in anomalies full of rats). one thing, though not directly related to sov, that may help stir up content are sites similar to the frostline and blood raider sites that were part of holiday events. i saw a lot of fighting in those areas, but clashing groups would likely only meet at the edges of held sov space. alternatively, maybe have some sort of resource or objective that spawns at regular intervals in random held systems, or maybe an anchorable structure that disrupts moon mining or ratting bounties, something along those lines that will force players to respond or experience a loss in income in an area (though if we went this route i'd also say we need to nerf some highsec sources of income, otherwise people will just go to highsec instead, namely incursions in this case.)sorry for the delayed response, i've been busy the past few days running pathfinder sessions and pulling assets out of pfr space in scalding pass, haha."

1/26/2016,"i'm liking this candidate. he doesn't overpromise, doesn't have irrational ideas built from a self-serving agenda, and has an excellent understanding of the mechanics of the game and so can give ccp solid feedback.also, points for building some great brawling fits that inspire me to build my own."
1/26/2016,"another option might be a reduction in firing speed. being able to drop your opponent's dps output would be of use across the board. it could possibly be applied to upgrade modules as well, meaning that drone modules such as damage amplifiers would have their effectiveness reduced as well. it works for all levels of engagement (i think) and is much more balanced in relation to the other e-war types."

1/26/2016,thank magyxk for the support <3
1/26/2016,erika kindly agreed to answer questions for me <3behind the platform - erika mizune
1/26/2016,"i doubt that more ways to create content in high sec is good for everyone. there's already more than enough ways -- so many in fact, that people who live in ls/00 rather play in high sec than in their home areas.on the note of isk making in syndicate: what about new missions, combat plexes (even ded 2/10s), exploration sites and anoms being made available only in ls/npc-00 (as also discussed with ty in his thread)? new burner missions, for example, would be a prime candidate for ls/npc-00 only as empire control is weaker there and these agents could go rampant more easily. that kind of policy would not detract from the value of high sec as it remains the same, but gives ls/00 an edge in terms of activity variety."
1/26/2016,not just end the war but win the war. for corps without territory the win condition against them could be destroying a certain amount worth of isk. for those with territory it could be destroying a couple pos or taking certain territorys.... goals like this would give both defenders and the aggressor goals they could accomplish to win the war. right now there is no way for a defender to win. they just have to take it until its over. honestly i think something like this would make wars more interesting. it would also give you something to accomplish instead of just camping targets into station. just a couple of ideas
1/26/2016,"giving an incentive for defense to actually fight back is key to making the mechanic worthwhile. eve is a game of internet spaceships and i think ccp guard said it best[ ""killing is just a means of communication"" ccp guard so lets get the conversation started and talking more often i want it to be know im not interested in removing the mechanic i want it to be more engaging for both sides. source for ccp guard quote:"
1/26/2016,"ccp guard is spot on, so why are you proposing a mechanism that will prevent even the possibility of any more killing taking place? how is stopping a war in the middle because one side wins a single battle going to promote more conflict?also, wars are the only way to blow up citadels in highsec, and as it stands, will require two consecutive wardecs and 8 days of reinforcements to explode. how would this even be possible if someone can stop the war and prevent you from having the right to try to shoot the structure when it comes into its final vulnerability window?"
1/26/2016,if you have the win conditions set as the citadel that changes things in your equation. the benefit of my idea is that its flexible (cost likely would be too) ill admit that its not a full idea but that is why its important to host town halls and communicate what would be best. first is cost. i made a joke a few days ago the concord has a lower cost to be paid off that a low quality hooker. 50 million isk is a pittance compared to corporate income i pay more than that for corp offices for a month. this needs to cost more. (i know i'm not making friends saying this but double or triple this would be more reasonable. but lets consider a scaleable war dec system. where groups with no assets in space can be war decced and given some way to win (this doesn't exist currently and not sure what it would look like.)the second level of this is a win condition of pos defense. win the timer an restront means you won the war. same can be done for customs offices and etc. (forces the fight to be over something. )then citadel wars. you are right they need to be longer to fit all the timers but what if the defense wins the first timer? or the second timer. should the war continue of there is no hope of finishing in the time frame. winning the timer being returning the shields to 50% (level to reset the reinforcement window) gives defense a purpose to fight at each timer so they can win. this is of course only an idea and a rough one at that. but starting the discussion on fleshing it out is the more important part and that takes more than one man or even a small group that takes a playerbase to be communicating
1/26/2016,"isn't the purpose of defending your citadel getting to keep your stuff? why do you need to offer more incentive to players to engage in pvp in this pvp game? certainly rewarding safety as an incentive to pvp seems... counter-productive. wouldn't just make more sense to move everything a player corporation has to offer - shared hangers, taxing ability, industry buffs, etc.- into a citadel and only allow wars against structure-holding corporations? i mean then players who are benefiting from the bonuses of being in a player corp have a reason to defend (to not lose their bonuses and structures), and players who are just in a social group but with no structures and thus no benefits above the npc corp wouldn't have to deal with wars? it seems simpler than your multiple tiers of wars for various reasons with confusing and changing victory conditions. as to cost, i don't see why that would work. ccp raised them 25-fold during the last wardec revamp, and all it seem to do was push wardeccers into ever-larger wardec alliances to share the costs of declaring war. raising the costs again probably would do more of the same, making even larger groups further increasing the disparity between professional mercenary corps and your average highsec corp while taking the ability to declare war out of the hands of small corps looking to settle a score with other small corps. well, it's your platform. thanks for taking the time to answer my questions and best of luck on your csm run."
1/26/2016,"hi there,just listened to your interview on the csm watch series - congratulations on being one of the few interviewees (so far) that can string a sentence together without losing the thread.i play solo in a c2 wh, mainly doing indy activities, as i don't really enjoy the pvp aspect of the game (or that of mmos in general), so it's refreshing to hear from someone that has those interests in mind going into the csm election.keep up the good work, you have my 2 votes coming your way"

1/26/2016,"hello space friends,i'd like to officially announce my candidacy for csm xi.most people who run for csm have a running platform, and after much deliberation, in depth conversations with current csm's, and those such as apothne who are running for this csm - i've decided for a simple platform.a vote for christy, is a vote not for bobmon. and a vote for old at ship supremacy.campaign posteri apologise for the late csm thread, but i've just got out of hospital after suffering from a collapsed lung, i can however confirm that the outlook is good, and i have a bike pump standing by in case of emergency.who is christy cloud?i began playing eve more time ago than i care to admit, infact my eve career began before i even had a bank account to pay for the subscription, instead around 8 trial accounts were my introduction to the eve universe, obviously i've progressed at least a little since then, so here's some of the things i've achieved in my notorious eve story. pro's and con's (because everyone has them, and self evaluation is fun)pro's-know's *snip* removed political link*snip* jet fuel does actually melt steel beams[/url]-is fully aware however, that jet fuel cannot melt dank memescons-may possibly need two airline seats to be booked in order to fly to iceland-faulty right lung-is a northener-isn't apothne-isn't a current csm-no csm experience, but everyone starts somewherefocusafter studying under the likes of the legendary rocket xi, rocket ten and dame death i feel like i am qualified to work on a pressing issue within the eve universe, super/capital balance as well as drawing more attention to the alliance tournament ships that are currently left in a sorry state, i'm looking at you adestria among others, but i'm more than 20m away so you can't lock me.i'd like to say ""in all seriousness"", but it's fairly obvious that while i wouldn't say no to the csm and would do my best, i think the application system is laughable. but since half of eve is applying, here i am. christy cloud for csm.i'd vote for me. selling 2 travelfit erebus 1 rigged 1 unrigged 85bil ea"

1/26/2016,what are your policies and views on the matter of fun and chill?
1/27/2016,"there is no purpose for war in this game other than for harassment and non-consensual pvp. and by the way, non-consensual pvp is harassment. i bring this up because this is the factor that is driving players away from this game.there is no purpose for war in this game. it is only used to circumvent security in high security space. thats it! it was supposed to have the purpose of providing a method for corporation to contest one another over resources. this is absurd, any resource worth contesting is out in null-sec or low sec. corporations only use it to keep other corporations perpetually in war, and harassing them until their members all quit or leave the game. if players dont want to pvp they should not be forced into it. war forces non-consensual pvp. the only way to get away from it is to leave the game and go play something else. war means there is no such thing as high security space. corporation who wants fights go out into null sec and get fights easy. the fights may not be easy, but it is easy to find someone to fight.why? because if someone enters low-sec or null sec they by default consent to pvp. get rid of war and increase your player base. there are many players who do no want to pvp. they want to play cooperatively with others in corporations, and do things together as teams and friends. they prefer pve content, and dont want to be harassed by the idiots who will be flaming this post. there are many solutions that could be implemented to change how things are controlled in high sec. currently capital ships are not allowed, and that model of exclusion could include other structures such as player owned starbases.for high sec create structures that are temporary, or have expiration's of some kind. or perhaps use something as simple as a license.for a pos in high sec, one would need to use a license for anchoring, because it is controlled space. the way to acquire a license could be numerous, such as rating with the corps who control, going through a long harrowing sequence of events and perform a number of tasks. (ie, pve content) this license would only last for a duration and cannot be extended. pack it up and move it until you acquire another license and get in que for another anchoring location.this is only one idea for a solution to the problems that war in high sec are supposed to be all about.get rid of war!get rid of permanent player owned structures in high sec.add more pve content.get more players in the game."

1/27/2016,"i'm not quite sure what you are referring to when you say ""all-in"". in terms of the sov revamp the trolling was pretty common in the beginning months but has died down significantly. the changes to interceptors limited the constant harassment due to ""because i can"" harassment. day to day has been relatively unaffected you still get roaming gangs, still can get stuff done. probably my biggest problem with the current sov system is that it rather hinders the interaction between neighbor groups who don't share the same timezone. for example if you have a russian vulnerable alliance directly next to an american vulnerable alliance it is extremely difficult to generate any meaningful content between the two. there is really nothing either alliance can do to the other short of ratting harassment in off peak times. this was a known flaw before the current sov system came about but they didn't know how to fix it. i don't have an answer myself for the problem now but i hope something can be developed."
1/27/2016,"missions, i am sort of against. what this leads to is one group monopolizing an area or a station or two, setting up safe pos in every system a mission can spawn, and generally not contributing to good content generation and income opportunities at the same time.the blood raider sites should be a model for active resources in space. things that are accessible, yet dangerous due to having to search for them and other players contesting them rather than the rats providing most of the challenge. furthermore, their loot had a harder time devaluing as it expired over time, and the demand for it was always going to be out there. plexes, anoms, belt spawns - anything to get people out and moving around such that they can meet people in the area and start playing the actual 'eve' game. i have had significantly more player interaction doing blood raider sites or deds than missioning. you just have to make it worth the time to do so. as i outlined in my exploration post, combat exploration is basically dead thanks to aegissov, at least in npc null, in an isk per hour, risk per isk sort of fashion. by all means do it if you enjoy it, but the effort you have to put in now for the extremely reduced payouts is....quite simply laughable. you are literally better off making a faction warfare alt an orbiting a beacon in a stabbed venture than trying to explore and take risks in npc null. now you can go ahead and say that's a result of player behavior, but that's a little derpy - when you double the havens in systems, and double the escalation rate, did you really think the supply side of null deds wouldn't change so drastically?for example, if scanned down and escalated sites had different loot tables, things would be fine. plenty of modules that do not have deadspace versions yet. basically, yes, fill space with things, lots of things, and make them things that are sought after and resistant to over monopolization by another space type. make them accessible so a smaller group of newer players can seek their fortunes in npc null - it's a place where they can play eve, rather than have eve played on them by big ticket sov entities."
1/27/2016,"i disagree there. give aridia special missions and people would want to go there and potentially live there to harvest the special treats. many would very likely seek agreements with local powerhouses like lsh or axios in order to run missions in peace, but others would not, creating a pocket of activity here and there beyond camps in vehan and scap ganks all over the region. not to mention that even those who seek blue standings with everyone still open up more targets for hunters and roamers in the area because more people would live there in the first place. that would be a conflict driver for low and npc null. furthermore, pos are attackable, moons are occupieable so that they cannot put up their own pos, citadells will be engagable. as far as i can tell, it works fairly well in pure blind with cfc trying to oppose moa and keep them from running mordus missions. it's merely my personal opinion, but out of 40 run gauntlets in querious, i have had exactly 1 encounter with another player. out of more than 30 frostline sites i have had exactly 0 encounters with other players (though, some encounters with blues who were of the opinion it's their site). i thus question the validity of gauntlet like things to bring people out into space. these items are already in any exploration or otherwise site to run: t1 items. everything else is prone to monopolization or oversupply because it is not used as extensively. gauntlets also lost their value really quickly as accelerators dropped from 200m in a matter of hours to barely 100m, or ofl sites which flooded the market with. in my opinion, the appeal of npc null to any size of entity in terms of money making are the missions there. you have your missions and do not need to worry about having to find a plex 10 jumps away or suitable anoms for your 30 active people in a system. i think that is what should be expanded upon."
1/27/2016,"missions just....have conceptual problems. i'm not seeing how these 'special' missions would be different in practice than the current iteration of level 5s where they are totally inaccessible to most players due to standings, alts, ships, locations, and/or local monopolies on power, but are extremely lucrative to a select group. l5s can currently, if you have extensive know-how and means, can meet or exceed wh level income quite easily. i don't like the fact that you can basically just sit in one area indefinitely and never have to wander or leave.available, and accessible income is what i am after. yes, if you study whs, or l5s, or incursions, put a lot of time into any of several gimmicks, you can make bank, but what you need is something where it can start to be utilized immediately after moving to an area so growth can happen, rather than the current set of outlets which require substantial investment time to start to see a big payout. one of the big things sov has is immediate, accessible income that is available and plentiful - you do not need standings, etc, to do anomalies. the general pattern or syndrome i see is a new group starts, and doesn't want to do fw or join a big sov bloc. they try npc null as they want freedom and content, but realize there's no way to support a corp, much less an alliance there. they are forced to pick fw or sov. i direct you again to the production vs destruction numbers for syndicate; people desperately love the npc null play style, but they have very little way to actually live there, not without lots of alts or going to other areas to make their cash. it is seriously annoying to players that it is better to go to a high sec incursion on average than to try and scrape a living in npc null.missions might be available income in that they do not deplete, and they may be good income depending on the lp stores, but it comes down to accessibility via standings and geography that sort of is a downer for them, that and they more or less promote sedentary behavior. it's one of those entry barrier things where unless your group is of sufficient size and stature, and can lockdown the entire mission pocket, you are better off running them in hi sec."
1/27/2016,"so i'll be the first to say i don't have all the answers i just have a theory. i like your idea but give them the incentive to fight to end a war dec and you will get a fight from defense. if no benefit you get nothing form a war on either side and really its a net loss to the game. to many war decs that don't have any kills at all. the reasons to fight from the office are readily apparent pvp, income gain from loot, income from mercenary work, and etc. its much better than current mechanics of ditching corp to mine for a week. or worse just not playing all together. i think this will create fights and we will see less war decs that have no losses on either side. additionally it will make it beneficial to run a defense and focus on defensive actions. the purpose is to make wars over something not just arbitrary isk amounts of losses.this means offence needs to bring their a game to each timer and win otherwise well then they loose the invested isk in the war. why would the defense fight for anything other than the last timer if there was no benefit to winning an earlier timer? as far as high sec goes though all assets can be redeemed at another station so loosing the citadel only costs the amount to replace it. from my point of view this would generate a lot more of a fight from defense than we see now. (having plenty of experience as the defense myself) as incentive the aggressors gain massive amounts of loot in the form of what drops form the citadels. (construction parts of the structure itself and they get to quite literally kick over the other guys sand castle. on the cost comment, can you afford 150 million isk to war dec a 50 man corp? i can. i'm not special either. i work for my isk. between production, incursions and scanning i make more than enough to do that multiple times a week i'm asking because i can afford that by a lot. as for it producing larger and larger groups for war decs that is a quantity issue. those groups are looking at war deccing hundreds of groups at one time in order to do that you need income and cost sharing from more and more people i don't argue that that is the case. what i can say is maybe this means they have to add a little more tactics to picking a war dec than scanning local in a trade hub. pick target rich groups with limited command structure and hit them. forces the professionals to view killboards check previous wars and etc prior to starting a war or risk a sum of money as a potential waste. tldr, the current guess and check method of war decs will go away. this honestly will be good for new players and retaining them long enough into the game to actually stand a chance against others. this will increase the amount of people out there and by volume increase the space carnage. the theory is basically catch and release. let the young survive (though learn a lesson every now and then) and open season on the older ones. insuring a population to harvest for years to come. side effect concord can earn back a little of its stripped dignity for doing what its done for so cheap for so long.... just some thoughts i like your ideas though"
1/27/2016,"uriel:just got off listening to your interview on csm watch.1) you represent very under-represented segment (insofar as the csm is concerned) of the eve population.2) you were very well spoken.3) you were on point.4) you had a stable of ideas that were well thought out, but you had the presence of mind to realize that would require you convincing ccp of their worth and working with them on things they decided to do. you didn't promise anything save that this was what you were interested in bringing to the table.quite simply, yours was the very best interview so far broadcast!you're at the top of my ballot, sir! good on ya!-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"

1/27/2016,"in regards to battleships, i simply feel that there should be a tradeoff in deployment versus power, and currently it feels that as a class they are overshadowed. i did not suggest buffing them, because i agree 100% that nerfing the strongest and buffing the weakest just makes us see-saw into different metas. one thing i do wish is that battleships had a little bit more of their ehp in resists as opposed to raw hp.and as for what temporary standings accomplish, it makes the job of an fc easier, and honestly i feel that fcs need more tools to make their job easier, while also encouraging each fleet member to also fly their own ship. it is a hard balance to reach for sure.ultimately though, i understand that as a csm you can't walk in with a list of things you want, because your main job is to discuss what is presented to you. i wish their was a better way to run for csm based on your ability to think and reason, as well as work well with others ."

1/28/2016,sorry for not posting over the last couple of days... things were getting so interesting that reading was much more... productive than posting.i am sure you all understand.
1/28/2016,"and defining competent? i do some industry as well... and consider myself competent.and i do not find what i am saying bad... i guess it is a question of focus, and priorities!"
1/28/2016,"controversy or not... it is going to happen... and the time to stop it has passed. i have not been able to find the opinions of all the current csm on this change - but i would hope that ccp at least tried to get some player feedback. now that it is coming... and not able to be stopped... i guess the priority would be on trying to stop the exploits before they happen, and the games economy ends up even more out of whack!personally, i do not think it a good idea... and not just because i am afraid that it will influence the prices of the freighter / jump freighter pilots i am training with intent to sell on the forums.the points that concern me have been raised on blogs out there, and some of the points that concern me only concern me since i read a blog, and thought ""oh yeah"". i do not want to be accused of stealing other peoples ideas... but my thoughts have developed out of the stream of conversation that has been going on.my main concern is the new player, his credit card, plex (and maybe rmt). i myself have a bunch of skills that i will never use. nowadays, when i make a new alt, i already have a plan, a training plan, and so on. back when i was made (primarily interested in hauling and so on) i was like ""astrometric rangefinding... coool!"". more than anything i would like to have brand new players protected from spending real money to buy skill points to make senseless characters. eve has a hard learning curve/cliff... but in order to progress past it, i think brand new players should have to progress past it... did that make any sense? i am not looking forward to the first killmail with those skill point thingies in it...unforseen side effects are unforeseen. i am sure no one really thought of hyperdunking before the bowhead was introduced? at least i hope so...and as for mitigating.... other than making sure that the right ccp devs are aware of exploits etc asap, i do not have any other specific ideas. i am sure the current csm or the relevant focus group (depending on what was used with what priority) have already worked on that *blind faith*."

1/28/2016,i support this product and / or service.
1/28/2016,"hello spacefriends!i am here to officially announce my candidacy for csm 11.first and foremost i am a community person. i believe the community is what makes eve great and what drives me to work for you all as a member of the csm. a consequence of this means that it doesn't matter if you live in highsec, lowsec, nullsec or a wormhole. as a member of the community your opinion is important to me and important to the game.the most important thing to take away from this statement is that i have my own opinion of what i think this game should be. however: ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" - spock (yay star trek)if elected to a seat on the csm i will work tirelessly to become the voice of the people and have that voice heard. i have always worked well with others and believe the csm is an amazing opportunity for all players to be represented.some of the subjects i support and endorse:1. the creation of wealth from the bottom up.2. stable nullsec industry with less of a need for importation.3. solo and small gang pvp.4. ecm rebalancing.5. checkboxes in all forms.my personal goal as a member of the csm is to further develop the eve community and esports within eve.member of the eve downunder team and founder of oceanic assault."
1/28/2016,"below are some answers to questions i have fielded since i announced my candidacy for csm.q: what suggestions do you have for your bottom up wealtha: i think first you need to look at the way the taxation system works and the way that alliances and larger entities generate their isk. i think the best way to achieve that goal and the industry goal is by finding ways to keep resources that are produced in nullsec by making it more profitable to perform the manufacturing and refining processes in null but also work on how the system works in highsec, convert moon mining to something more like asteroid mining the moon mining one is more difficult because you need to want to take it out of the hands of a single player operating a pos style but you also don't want to lose that mechanic and the fights that money moons generate.q: huge amount of isk i would imagine is generated through the refine tax of stations, how would you take that out of single player / large groups hands?a: refining tax is one of the only types of bottom up isk generationthe minerals that are taxed go to the owner of the stationso, all the newbies do the mining, then refine, most of those refined minerals go to the player but a percentage is taxed by the corp or alliance.the player is the bottom doing the work and gets 90% of the profit and the top gets 5-10% with money moons atm the alliance just mines the moon and nobody gets that isk except the alliance.q: so why does ccp have to step in for alliance politics and revenue generation? a: well, they don't however i think players should have the ability to mine everything they need to do manufacturing in nullsec. as it stands at the moment some alliances just ship their moon goo to jita and sell it there so, my suggestion would be something like a land rights tax, this tax would be based on planting a citadel on a moon that creates mineralsnumber of minerals that can be mined per hour x 24 x ""alliance set tax modifier"" = land rights.the other option would be to have a mining specific tax instead of for just anywhere so, to activate the mining lazor on your citadel you have to pay for a 24 hour license and there is an auto refresh with diminishing returns after say like 5-10 citadels mining it but a limited amount of resources so like how much dispro can you mine in an hour lets just say 1000so each of the 10 citadels will get 100 in an hour but you have 11 mining each of them gets like 90 or somethingq: are you for or against the removal of pos"" entirely? as in the current stick + bubble thinga: yes, i am for the replacement of poses with citadels, i think poses provide too much of a tactical advantagei would think of them as sticks with shields, costing 150m and having the hp of a super and that's just dumbq: are you in favor of removing the current outposts entirely?a: and their subsequent replacement with citdels? yes, replacing both those structures with a new one and subsequently dropping the old pos and station code is a great idea.q: so **** the history of the game and make way for the new kids on the block?a: if the community feels very strongly about keeping history like that in the game they could use them as models in the futureq: no i'm talking about how when they were built they were sold as permanent fixtures of the gamea: i guess the real question is what would we prefer, to have the same stations and poses with old code which is difficult to maintain forever or to replace them with citadels that is easier to maintain and manage?it's my belief that with every other major change where something has been removed, and item of similar value has been used to replace it i would have to draw the conclusion that the stations would be replaced with a citadel of equal value.q: so i invested approximately 10% of the build cost of a permanent fixture on the game and can say for my 3bil isk, that i touched the eve landscape. how do you replace that?a: i would think it would be replaced with a citadel, i don't have all the answers and unfortunately i can only take your opinion to ccp and attempt to get a response. how would you resolve the situation?q: since eve social recognition is killmail driven. how important do you think recognition be given to the logibros who keep dudes alive and in the fight.a: i think right now, being a logibro is a bit of a thankless job, as you said, you don't get the killmail but you do get to ""save space lives"" you can end up playing a pivotal role in a fleet fight. i think the believe that eve social recognition is killmail driven is a bit false. social recognition can come in many forms, performing the functions of an fc or logi anchor (as far as pvp goes). social recognition is also driven by pve activities but most importantly by the community you belong to. some groups do it well, some not so well. to answer the original question though you could like logis to killmails the ships they rep shoot.q: logibros are the first to die, or at the point of being ineffectivea: well, if you put it that way, logibros do get killmails, just the sad kind. after that it's up to the pilots ""governing body"" to provide social recognition of financial compensation for the act of flying logi."
1/28/2016,i don't think the csm could handle chiimera
1/28/2016,if elected to the csm i will take that into consideration and play nice.remember a vote for chiimera is a vote for you!
1/28/2016,"says a member of the alliance that burned down content ring, will fully trading an extremely active small gang sanctuary in the name of politics, security, or both."
1/28/2016,and because of my affiliation i can't be a proponent of solo and small gang pvp? last year i ran a tournament with over 100 participants called oceanic assault out of my love for the australian timezone and solo pvp. it's quite disappointing if you can't look past someones alliance ticker when considering their nomination for csm.
1/28/2016,the big question is are you going to be sion's proxy if you get voted in ?or do you actually for ideas of your own ?
1/28/2016,"the short answer is no and the long answer is no.my candidacy is based on representing everyone who plays eve.now that that's out of the way, remember a vote for chiimera is a vote for you!"

1/28/2016,"i'd take the following explanations/rationalizations as legitimate of where you can like solo and small gang, yet remain a member of one of the largest alliances with outstanding and continuing crimes against the play style, even if they are a little two faced:a)gsf has srp. i'm in it for the srp so i can small gang and solo in peace. b)all my friends are in gsf. being part of gsf and saying you are a proponent and enthusiast of small gang is like saying you are deeply concerned for preserving biodiversity, yet being on the board of a company with an extremely sketchy environmental record, literally saying save the whales while butchering them for cosmetics or save the rain forests while bulldozing them for slightly better profit margins on paper products. absolutely someone's playstyle doesn't need to match their ticker. you can be a ganker without a code. tag, etc, and in such a huge alliance obviously there are going to get more exceptions than an in a small focused one. at best it makes you an oddity, and a conflicted one at that: what does being in gsf really do to further your solo and small gang experience? do you even agree with the burning of cloud ring? does having blue standings to half the cluster really make your solo experience better?since you are responding in a productive way i'll be quite honest; some of the most fun loving and best solo players i know are in gsf corps. however you still have to admit it is sort of odd - on one hand relishing the fun and the rush of pvp on a small scale, yet tacitly supporting an empire that at best inhibits a ton of interaction in favor of safety, and at worst is actively hostile to it. when is the last time gsf sported an at team? can you really stomach a fickle tyrant that trades pvp opportunities for ad-revenue and to expand and secure a grotesquely bloated empire of quasi-renters? with the cfc's bulldozing of content ring, you really can't expect people to cheer and want to shake your hand when you sport the ticker that reminds them of how the cfc at large really feels about good content creation. that is why i question. explain away if you wish, i am listening."
1/28/2016,"i have to say that any representation into csm from inextremis should be void immediately. as you are a participating/active officer inside of inextremis and as someone who bared witness with your involvement with the co2 scandal. cowardly hiding when the serious questions got asked. i am very judgmental of your capabilities to keep your candidacy honest, and true to your intentions. good luck."

1/28/2016,"hello guys! i'm rivver and after many years of eve online, i felt that was finally time to apply for the csm. i am running on no platform. i know that sounds strange but i believe my role should be as your advocate rather than to push a agenda. speaking as someone who has remained independent since inception, i don't have any dogs in the fight. i do want to see the csm return to the spirit in which it was intended and that means showing ccp where the problems are and helping them get the player viewpoint.you can be anyone and bring something to me. i'm not running to push a specific change, i'm there to report a problem and deliver possible solutions. we know that we can't just say that a ship is too strong or that jita station is too small, we have to deliver something that can make things work. everyone has a different viewpoint or desire but at the end of the day, we need to focus on what makes the game thrilling and brings us back for more. my personal interests are hauling cargo that is difficult and dangerous and the in-game economy. i'm not much of a combat person but i love the thrill of slipping past camps with precious cargo and i only contract direct with the client. special jobs for special needs, giving me a small role in a metagame as well as the chance to rub elbows with the movers and shakers of the eve universe. in other words, i am very neutral because my in-game profession depends on it.these things said, i am there for you, regardless of who you are. i've played this game for over a decade and i would love to play it for a couple decades more. thank you for your time!"
1/28/2016,"lmao, you cant be serious."
1/28/2016,"finally available, the interview recorded by csm watch for the csm 11 election coverage: gorski car interviewenjoy !"
1/28/2016,"locked for above mentioned reasons. if you are serious about being a candidate for csm, please apply some actual effort without trying to create a mess. we really appreciate it."
1/29/2016,"ummm... the game itself is based around (and supports) non-consentual interactions in almost every activity (which, by default, makes everythig you do pvp in some form).no one the game has any ""right"" to be left alone. fight for what you want, defend what you have.not supported."
1/29/2016,"perhaps you could post with your main, coward npc alt, and we could 'harass' each other"
1/29/2016,"time and again i read, that ""players who don't want pvp should not be forced into pvp"" ... well - this is a pvp game. it's like saying players who don't like tennis should not be forced to play tennis. tell you what: they aren't. just don't play tennis. if you don't like other players shooting at your pixel-meeple, don't play a game that's all about shooting other guys pixel-meeples.every bit of meaningful pvp is non-consensual. heck, wars themselves are never consensual - wars are all about conflicting interests. player 1 puts a pos on a moon, player 2 wants to put his pos there as well, so player 2 declares war on player 1 and tries to take that pos down by force, with or without consent. if pos licenses were temporary, people would fight over the grinding-spots for those licenses. or over the fuel. or just because they want to put their pos down right now right here, and not once the license has run out. of course people do not want other people to attack their ****. that doesn't mean that people shouldn't be able to attack other peoples **** unless invited to (seriously - who does that? ""please come and kill my ihub!"" ... not going to happen) removing non consensual pvp from the game would mean removing every sense of purpose from it. silly idea from a player who probably hasn't seen much of this game yet.no."
1/29/2016,"eve is a conflict driven game. if nothing else, is not war conflict?the purpose of war in new eden is asset and trade hub denial. i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
1/29/2016,"thanks for having me on csm watch. for all those interested, please check out"
1/29/2016,"if your op actually contained any useful information then sure but you haven't provided anything of use in your op and refuse to answer people when they ask you for clarification.your short version is 3 lines, your ""long"" version is only 6."
1/29/2016,"are the issues you saw with the csm back then the same as they are now?if so, have your reform plans changed since then, or are they still the same ""gestapo""-type ideas?can you specifically list a few of those controversies, especially the csm-rattling kind for those of us who were not playing then, and let us know how you would go about avoiding incidents like that in the future?and something you did not mention in your original post. do you think the csm has any kind of power or influence on anything these days? if yes, could you define that kind of influence for those who may not know the ins and outs of space politics and give a few recent examples where the csm did anything?if no, do you think you can change that, and how?"
1/29/2016,you have my vote also :)

1/29/2016,leeloo interview 2: csm boogaloo
1/29/2016,"i know its late to join in. i didn't join in earlier, because i wasn't sure enough i could give it my full 100%. looking at the current developments with my own alliance, i can give it my full 100% now.most know me from the marmite collective and the many wars we had the last years, but i'm also very active in low-sec industry running posses, 00 pvp and more on my alts. i hope you understand, i 'll keep the names of those alts and their corps/alliances secret * first of all, i don't want to be someone who is only complaining about things. if you complain about things, you should run for csm and try to help out. complaining is very easy, the csm is hard work.* my thoughts on war decs.* like last year, i still think ganking needs to be looked at, so we get more interaction between attackers and defenders.* not going to throw in all kind of new ideas to add/change in eve, but if you have any, feel free to reply here for my thoughts on them.* i'm not a native english speaker, so keep that in mind when you hear me on a podcast. the ideas are there, expressing them in proper english is something else. typing is easier than live podcasts.vote for me if you want a hard working guy in the csm, that is willing to listen to what you have to say and be your voice.running for csm you do as a person, not a character you play in eve. in real life i help people, in eve i want to be evil. don't mix them up when you vote, as the real life player wants be in the csm.tora bushidotwitter : @blowfish70"
1/29/2016,reserved
1/29/2016,i hope that you have a decent proposal / a decent opinion for the high sec wardec problems... :)good luck with your campaign!p.s. any ideas what one can do to make bounties relevant?p.p.s. posted before tora updated the op.
1/29/2016,"(tora) i didn't join in earlier, because i wasn't sure enough i could give it my full 100%. looking at the current developments with my own alliance, i can give it my full 100% now.i say you can give it 100% as your alliances is falling apart.i vote for tora the man"
1/29/2016,"i want to take this opportunity to clarify my reform stance.beware its not sexy, doesn't add ships to the game doesn't promote pvp, but politically speaking will reinvigorate the voter base and should increase voter turnout.so here's the idea. increase voter turnout via promotion and availability of csm members. this can be done in several ways. so get out to vote promotion. the easy stuff create a option in the help menu with a csm option with contact methods for the csm members based on area of the game they want to suggest changes to. billboards in space with csm campaign slidescaptains quarters tv with csm adds (simple as a photo with csm logo over it)make elections an icon on the side bar or under the social tab so voting can be done from in game. new player mission via aura / opportunities that discusses the csm's purpose. the goal is to increase voter turnout, and increase visibility of the csm. while empowering the player base to be involved in the process. and so that maybe a day will come when the question what is the csm isn't the first thing everyone asks when you say your running for it."
1/29/2016,"i don't think it's odd that a pilot from a large coalition is supportive of small gang and solo pvp at all. when i run into a gatecamp in a solo ishtar that has 12 interceptors and 6 falcons i don't scream content killer, i go and get another ship and in my opinion it's exactly the same when a large alliance takes over a region. just because your play style conflicts with someone else's play style it doesn't make it good or bad, it just makes it different.what happened when the cfc ""bulldozed content ring"" did everyone stop playing and now all they do is post on forums? i'm going to assume that what came next was what the sandbox game is all about: they adapted, moved to another location and continued developing their playstyle.i have also personally requested that the mittani stop killing the space whales and cutting down the space rainforest."
1/29/2016,"well, now you've won my vote."
1/29/2016,what a reasonable and humor filled response.you have my vote.
1/29/2016,"the csm is there to communicate the players concerns to ccp regarding real world game development. your choice to bring in a completely unrelated issue, that is unknown to a majority of the eve community, only shows your attempts at defamation.i am sorry, but you were not at the forefront of this so-called 'scandal' and are simply using whatever information you were fed to hinder my chances of running for csm."
1/29/2016,its a completely related issue because your involvement with indy's scam was for personal gain. i have a problem trusting anyone that scams players/corporations/alliances that wish to represent myself at a bigger table. as anyone else should. defamation is 100% correct because you are not a fit candidate and anyone who wishes to learn more about his involvement with co2/inextremis i urge you to make contact with me before making the mistake of voting for you.
1/29/2016,"huh, and i thought it was an endorsement.scamming is legal within the game and more than one csm member has, in the past run scams before/during/after holding office. so i took it as a sign of cleverness and people skills rather than a black mark.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
1/29/2016,"fiber you need to grow up. i flew with you a short time in the culture and you take everything far too seriously, he'll i'm surprised you even logged in long enough to comment on this. since when is scamming (if even true) a knock on somebody's eligibility or competency to be on the csm? some of the greatest stories in eve are about large thefts and espionage, hell it's what draws a lot of people to the game. if it is true and was involved in some master scam and theft of a (still blue) former alliance then i'm surprised he isn't campaigning on it. i would. as has been said here already the csm's job is to advocate on behalf of the players. im not sure how doing something completely within the rules of the game makes somebody unfit for this. if you have a problem with him then talk to him personally and don't bring up personal grudges on a public forum, that's a cowardly way to do it."
1/29/2016,i have flown with annex for quite awhile in itai. i trust that he will do very well in representing the players. i have knows annex to be truly dedicated to the players to his left and right in itai. i know he will take those same principles with him when he goes to represent the players of eve.
1/29/2016,thanks for all the nice messages guys!#eve_nt website; www.eve-nt.uk blog;<U+FFFD>
1/29/2016,"hi guys! i am still playing with the structure but i wanted to let you know that i will be asking for at least four ""secretaries"" from the player base to help field game mechanic issues. i might ask for more helpers later but the role of these people is grab the particular issues from their respective neighborhoods. this is means a high sec, low sec, wormhole and null sec person. this person can be affiliated with anyone and i am just looking for someone that can take an accurate non-biased view of their particular area. post in my thread if you are interested in helping out. i won't pick anyone out until after the election. thanks!"
1/30/2016,"nope, non voters are people who just do not give a shyte about this worthless csm crap, simple as that."
1/30/2016,i really hope that newly elected csm memebers would have more influence on ccp vision of eve future and implementing new features. we need more csm members vs. current and who are self confidient and more independent from blocs with active position and participation on eveo forums.looks like it is the only way to make eve better.
1/30/2016,voting for some of them will certainly help achieve this.
1/30/2016,can you link his gestapo-stylez ideas ?
1/30/2016,"i was having a rather awkward conversation with a former member of the csm in the basement of the celtic cross in iceland. i proposed the idea of term limits and a system to kick involuntary people and she told me my proposals were ""gestapo-esk"". she has some rather strong opinions and she is perfectly entitled to those opinions. we now have a system to kick people who are asleep at the wheel and while term limits aren't a policy i don't think they will need to be at this juncture."
1/30/2016,"so, does that mean the reforms you are proposing without laying them out in detail have already happened?"
1/30/2016,"toxic kindly answered some questions for me, interview here"
1/30/2016,thanks for the interview!
1/30/2016,"i firmly believe that toxic yaken is a solid candidate to represent high-sec players in csm xi. where others just call for nerfs to high-sec content to benefit other areas of space, toxic is fighting to keep high-sec relevant. he's level headed and isn't interested in only benefiting and improving gameplay for his specific nice. high-sec is what feeds and fuels your players into low and null and is just as important. let toxic help us make a better high-sec for all of us."
1/30/2016,"i want to thank everyone for their kind word thus far. it really does cement my resolve to run as a candidate for csm xi. you all drive me to be better, and do better. i won't let you down!vote the judge for csm xi!"
1/30/2016,"yes tora, you do have plenty of time now that archtype and whats have shut down your alliance. +1 tora. (he's got the time)-loreth"
1/30/2016,"think he lacks the alliance members even to get him 1% of the votes of last year.that's right tora's alliance is nearly dead and he's got more time on his hands cause he isn't taking contracts.but all's fair in war tora, so i wish you luck."
1/30/2016,"welcome back to the csm race, tora!just a quick question for you:in the past three years, sabriz adoudel, psychotic monk, and yourself have all been unsuccessful in capturing a seat on the csm. is csm11 the year we finally get a highsec candidate on the csm? will toxic yaken's more moderate stance help or hinder this?"
1/30/2016,"sabriz and monk are both qualified players who i have voted for in the past. and i have to admit, you have done much better then i expected too this year of course i want to be the guy in the csm, but if a better (wo)man with a highsec background wins a seat, i would be happy too. not sure if toxic yaken running is good or bad. you could probably ask him the same question. and i'm also not just running for highsec, as i also enjoy low sec industry a lot.until then, vote for me!"
1/30/2016,"thanks. good to see people can make a difference between evil rp enemies in game and serious rl csm business in here.i'm running for csm as myself, not the evil role playing character i play with."
1/30/2016,"very happy to see this is happening this year tora. i made a blog post the day before this campaign thread was started, suggesting why i think you would make a great csm. not going to repeat it all in here but here is the link if you want a read:"
1/30/2016,thankyou sir i hope your campaign is long and fruitful
1/30/2016,best of luck with your campaign!are you an official imperium candidate or are you running without any official support?
1/30/2016,"most you of should have never heard of me. this is intentional as i prefer to remain behind the curtain. i am perhaps the most xenophobic of all the goonswarm directorate and this has manifested itself in essentially a shadow broker persona. when it comes to eve i have mostly done everything there is to do with a handful of exceptions. whs are not for me for example. but hey, that is what minions are for right.my focus is the meta, game mechanics, economics, and empire building. i am a soothsayer, cartel leader, mass manipulator, and the transmission of our war machine. my platform can be summed up very simply as this:anything that promotes discreet mechanics that build upon each other to form a complex player ran empire, or even small businesses, i am going to promote. anything that is siloed or has little relation to other systems i will lobby against.i see eve as a large organism that benefits from complex interactions. as far as i am concerned, the future of eve is about territory, space meta, doomsdays glittering across space, sandcastles burning off the gates of ec-. every story needs a villain. i am pretty qualified for that."
1/30/2016,"honestly, it won't really matter if anyone outside our organization votes for this guy or not. this thread is now a forex appreciation thread."

1/30/2016,"[quote=vic jeffersonwhy doesn't red frog hire professional counter-bumpers? surely it is of the size and strength that hiring professional white knights isn't unreasonable?[/quote]the trouble is that you would need a 24/7 (-20mins ) anti counter bumper group covering all high sec, where a dedicated bumper/ganker group can setup in 1 hour where ever they want and only need to be active for 2-3 hours to do real damage.with about 300 and more contracts a day the costs for a protection team would far exceed the results anyway."
1/31/2016,not an issue for discussion. please read the sticky about issues. thank you.closed.
1/31/2016,"many of things i have pushed for in the past ended up just getting implemented when ccp seagull took the reigns as executive producer. so yea it can be kinda funny or unnerving when your ~master stroke~ that you have had on the back burner for half a year becomes to focal point of a rising star's new game design narrative. the next logical step was reform because it's not within ccp's decision tree or behavioral norm to do that unless prompted too.some things have already happened, but as the result of player actions; not development practices. once inside the csm, i will have the data i need to bring about reform."

1/31/2016,i flew with vic in another incarnation and he's a top bloke with a lickable face.
1/31/2016,"having just been interviewed by lanctharus and jayne, i can say that these guys aren't afraid to ask the important questions (and the ones that make you sweat). a relaxed, but thoroughly professional process that gets the answers the community of new eden deserves to know about the people they might elect.10/10 would be grilled again."
1/31/2016,at this point in time i am not an official imperium candidate nor did i discuss my candidature with imperium leadership before submitting it. however the way that the imperium selects candidates is complex and this may change in the future.

1/31/2016,"i have officially declared my candidacy for this year's council of stellar management. i would like to focus on player decline in eve-online and try to come up with ways to fix our community's dwindling numbers. i think that looking back to when eve was in its golden age (50-60k+ players online at high times) would help us work out some of the problem. i know some people just get bored of eve or don't have time to play because of jobs/family/etc, but i feel there are other factors too that have contributed.there have been many balancing/game-changing patches, some good...others not so. i'm a big believer that if it isn't broken, don't fix it. i know these changes are made to improve the gaming experience, but some of us like things to stay the same or similar.some of my ideas:-bring back the old profession system to improve new player experience, perhaps sp to allocate so they have a foot to stand on when some of our community have over 200mill sp. the game is 13 years old and new players need incentives to feel useful.-more profitable pve, creation of more ded sites.-a dock timer on logistics ships, but no suspect flag, except to the war target.-dock timer on suspect gank'n'scoop haulers.-cheaper war declarations.-an interdiction nullified ship that can actually do sites above a 4/10. or a change to the subsystem's slot configuration.-make mining more profitable...it is the base of our economy.-high sec moons with rarity 8 and 16 moon goo.-more content, the eve gate...reopening maybe? travel around the sol system?drop me an in-game mail anytime. i also have a ts server for those who want to converse about my campaign. have a wonderful day, capsuleers of new eden.holeysheet1killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
1/31/2016,what do you plan on doing about the growing vic jefferson problem in syndicate region?
1/31/2016,"the way i see it is pretty simple. you know what he flies, you know what he usually does, and you know how to avoid it. as much as some people don't like the way he flies, if he enjoys it, then let him be."
