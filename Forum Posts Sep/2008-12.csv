12/1/2008,lolnotice how only people with funny names are supporting?
12/1/2008,"signed/i do realise that ccp don't want to buff drones in fear of extra lag, but i'm sure there can be a compromise.so wanted:more dedicated drone boats.more drones (meta drones anyone?)rogue drone storyline continued.a bit of general drone love."
12/1/2008,"there are rigs or hardwirings giving all those modifiers, none for the drones (beside the rig for sentry drones damage), so after drones have got the rigs and harwirings you can start to whine for the modules."
12/1/2008,"supported. i would we pleased if we would at least get implants and mods for drones in the next patch, especially damage mods/imps."
12/1/2008,"i had a huge batch of proposals for new modules six months ago when these issues first started coming up. since they're still valid now, here goes:"
12/1/2008,i support this topic. i love my drones. the things i use most ;)
12/1/2008,examine the changes oulined above.

12/1/2008,"its clear strenght is being so useless that it's rarely primaried. but yes, split weapon systems for the fail."
12/1/2008,any greater kind of alliance mechanism is a good idea by my standards!
12/1/2008,shooting pos is so much more unbearable. reducing the pos numbers should work better or complet redesign of this part of eve would be even better.
12/1/2008,"wow, i didn't know this one was still going, i am very hopeful in the area however, still banging my head on the desk waiting for that next array to anchor..."
12/1/2008,"so now the witch hunt turns to me. well, i'm not an alternate. i've only played about a month and this is the first mmo where macros were considered such a big problem. i can see people in places maybe playing this game in order to sell for real money. i've seen the spam. i really just don't understand the whole macro thing and how timing can prove someone is a macro. i have a scientific background and i just don't take things on faith, without hard proof. and the methods outlined to spot a macro seem too general and contradictory. i don't really know what it is about this game, but people are usually really mean right off the bat. i thought this was a real cool game when i looked at it, but i'm started to regret having subscribed to this game. do nice people even play this game? or is everyone just out to grief everyone else?"
12/1/2008,"the griefing elements of the players base have a large visibility in forum, but if you avoid some system, way less in game. people like the op want to gank players in high sec, but to feel right about it play the ""morally superior"" card. for him if you keep a precise schedule you are a macro,but it you don't keep a precise schedule you are a macro too. if you always warp to the same spot you are a macro, but if you warp to different belts you are a macro too, and so on. practically any behavior you keep, if you mine you are a macro. so he feel good killing miners as they are macros. with 30k on line as an average, you get a fair number of players that have the need to feel big killing someone and pick new players as an easy target. they congregate in the starting system and other overcrowded high sec system where they can find new players to harass. move away from those systems (and maybe away from the caldari regions) and you will meet them very rarely."
12/1/2008,"not talking in local or answering convos doesn't make someone a macro - maybe they just don't want to talk to you? sitting and mining for hours on end doesn't make someone a macro - maybe they just have alot of free time? the most reliable way of spotting a macro is the 'kill them all and let god sort them out' method - suicide gank the suspect, and see how they react. if they sit there as though nothing has happened, or carry on repeating the movement patterns in their pod that they were making whilst in their ship, you've probably found a macro. if they call you names in local and undock in a blasterthron looking for you, it probably wasn't."

12/1/2008,"it is easy to fix , in noob npc corps you are only allowed to fly frigs and destroyers :)"
12/1/2008,it's amazing how many people run away from and wish to place absurd restrictions on the basic design concept of eve online.
12/1/2008,"god, what idiot put you in again for csm. because 2 csm members are in npc corps we can't put this issue forth to you? what happened about listening to your playerbase? hello, this is an mmorpg, where lots of people play and may want a change that you do not like. stop being so selfish and arrogant. sure, this is a whine thread just because you don't like it? gtfo.you answered your own question. if a tax is implemented, the reason a player corp is superior to a npc corp is a lower tax rate. most corps have ~10% tax so that instead of 20% is a good reason. all of this would have to go with a new war declaration system, that is agreed. ccp is already looking at war declarations, we need them to look at npc corps at the same time, fair is fair.for an ""industrialist"" what is a 20% tax rate? does it affect buying minerals? mining? refining? manufacturing/researching slot cost? market orders? contracts? hmmm, no it doesn't now does it? so how does this affect ""industrialists"". ahhhhh, are you talking about mission runners? well yes it affects them, the anti-eve solo players. what is wrong about rewarding the players ccp wants and giving out very slight penalties to people who refuse to play a multiplayer game with *gasp* other players?no problem here with lots of 1 man alt corps, we already have that now and i don't see how it hurts anything. i don't buy the 'tons of lost subscription threat' either. i have seen it many times, supposedly eve should have been rocked by the quitters from the nano nerf or the missile nerf or the ghost training nerf, but it hasn't. players should be encouraged to leave npc corps. this is not the case with the way npc corps currently work. it needs to be changed. a big no to forcing people out of npc corps, a big yes to giving out incentives. big no for prejudiced csm members. bug yes for this thread."
12/1/2008,"as much as you want to spin it, vaal, most corps don't give back even the value of a 5% corp tax (and i don't mean giving back in isk, but in mutual support or even simple advice).it is easiest to get decent advice in a npc corp chat than in most players channels."
12/1/2008,i can just smell the hypocrisy blowing in from the nether-regions of space here.and thats everyone here who is in favor of this stupid assed proposal.
12/1/2008,"as long as founding a single man corp, training some skill a player has no interest in training and getting cut out from some of the liveliest chat channels is better than joining 50%+ of the players corps it it the player corps that are flawed, not the npc corps.too much bad ceo/directors, no functional system to recognize good corporation without joining, too easy for the directorship of the corp to screw the membership without any possibility for the member players to check what the ceo and directors are really doing with the isk and materials. and then too much people that want the current system to change only to get more targets to grief."
12/1/2008,"it's a simple end:to run a player corp is a challenge, as bunyip said. from dealing with members to juggling tons of pos.there is none of that on npc corps, all you have to deal with is channel spam since you can't close the corp channel.so... what do you pay to be complete immune from war? immune from the logistical headache of managing a corp? paying office rents, dodging war decs, and managing a corp of 1?nothing.no tax, no wardecs, nothing.simply put:there should be a cost to that immunity, a cost higher than corp channel spam. i proposed a skill and agent cap for nuub corps. this won't hamper new players in any way, but it'll force older players to look outward to grow upward. if they don't want to they can stay there with the limits and grind away.i proposed a ship & agent cap for npc corps. other than limiting a few narrow ship types (that can be trained) it is hardly much of a limit to those who don't want to grow... but if they want to grow, they need to move on.that's all we want them to do, move on and grow up. and the won't be wardecced left, right, and center. few of them will face wars unless they put themselves out there... mob mining, smack talking, loot stealing... beyond that, no one looks twice at a wandering hauler in highsec.and... so freaking what if someone wardecs a 1 man corp??? you know how bloody annoying it is to track down and camp one pilot??? have any of you folks asking to be allowed the invulnerability of npc corps ever even fought a war, from either side? if the declaring corp has 10 wars open against 10 1 man corps then they're pretty lame, and bored out of their heads because of the time involved chasing shadows. much less the isk involved.you'll be surprised how many one man corps do the declaring, actually."
12/1/2008,i'll go you one better: that kind of immunity shouldn't be in the game
12/1/2008,"you get all of the same benifits making your own one man corp... vets shouldnt be in noob/npc corps, not without 100% tax imo..anyone over a year omld shouldnt be alowed to have the cover the noobcorps offer. its 'uneve'"
12/1/2008,"what i would expect to happen is an abject slaughter unless they decide to hide, pick up pitchforks, and/or or hire help. mercenaries exist for a reason. industrial corps should be able to hire us for corporate terrorism or simply to knock out the competition in a certain market/raise competators costs. war decs are the only mechanic for this unless the industrial corp is 0.0 based, in which case it's most likly far from defenseless. i think npc corps having a tax would be a better way to go than screwing with war decs in favor of further protecting certain types of corporations."
12/1/2008,"incorrect.taxes can and will be dodged easily. just trading the goods across to a market alt who is in a one-man corp neatly prevents any taxes npc corps might levy.limits on npc corps are ones that cannot be subverted... skill limits and shiptype limits are the most obvious, while agent limitations can be worked around with some work."
12/1/2008,"seriously wondering if the new csm will psuh the issue again with ccp. ccp was going to look into it but it's very, very, very quiet on the subject."
12/1/2008,"it is sad when a tier 1 fully insured battleship with t1 fit will do the bombing job much better and cheaper than a stealth bomber ^^both of its weapon systems have to be improved. even if bombs were 1 isk/pcs it would be still useless ,they are only good for popping drones and afk frigs."
12/1/2008,how about a drama bomb?
12/1/2008,"bombs as they are atm are almost perfect. the only change needs to be the fire and forget. as of yesterday, getting podded after launching but before detonation makes the bomb go away, no damage. this is wrong, unless the bomb itself is destroyed by a smartbomb or a dd or w/e phyically kills bombs, they should explode. bombs are for breaking up blobs, and in the right situations they do it, with the right setup on the bomber you can get away most of the time. in any situation, they take alot of work and supreme coordination to inflict mass km's.. but even in a failed or tactically flawed bomber attacks on any blob ive encounterd,they usually laugh, but they always leave...nullnullnull"
12/1/2008,"i like the idea, now regarding disconects and logging off, the ms/titan could enter a siege mode of some sort and become smth. like a pos (emphasis on smth.).furthermore, the pilot of the ms/titan could deliberately leave it in such a state and jump into one of the ships in the docking bays of the said ms/titan and join the fight. that would require strict access right management upon docking but i think this should be doable (disclaimer: i'm not a programer).signed/edit:and i do think they should be much much bigger. when i first heard the word ""mothership"" in eve, i imagined a mobile station dwarfing everything on the battlefield, not some glorified carrier."
12/1/2008,"that would add realism, i'll support this."
12/1/2008,yes.
12/1/2008,"yes i totally agree, multiple undocking points would be a major plus, i can understand why ccp wouldn't want to do this as there are visual docking ports and seeing how your ship is coming out of one is cool and all. however, if this were the case then we would all have to move our ships to these docking ports and dock that way instead of at any point.multiple undocking points needs to be a must. in busy systems especially.atrossoe"
12/1/2008,"asuri,i thought you were in the other forum lol..actually eliminating missions would keep eve true to your beloved wide open theory ... and is quite a good idea.. how did we manage to agree ?"
12/1/2008,i'm everywhere! :) and we're not agreeing. . . i think... ;)ak
12/1/2008,good idea...unfortunately alliances like blob don't care much about diplomacy or coalitions or nations. they'll rp apart a blue as quickly as a neutral just because they're bored and know that no one will do anything about it.
12/1/2008,"what would this add that we can't do already, exactly?if a group of friendly alliances are incapable of sorting out a bluelist and a shared intel channel without an ingame tool to hold their hands for them, it doesn't say much for the communication or organisation abilities which they'd need if and when somebody comes along and attacks them (and no amount of ingame tools are going to sort out things like teamspeak and forums access or the inter-alliance chain of command).its not a really awful idea or anything, just that its usefulness seem a bit limited."
12/1/2008,"i agree with the last poster. alliances are in informal coalitions all the time in the game. i do not disagree with the proposal per se, but what we need is more meat for administration of territories and politics as a wholea) in-game political institutions, like roles in cooperations but of bigger political consequences (ministries, senates, elections, governorships, bureaucracies, military commands, agent maintenance).b) the possibility for empire and/or factions, via gms and ccp helpers, to delegate titles and/or responsabilities over regions or constellations in exchange for an oath of allegiance to that said faction."
12/1/2008,exactly right. there's really nothing for these coalitions to do that can't already be done by methods outside the game and the standing system.
12/1/2008,and what happens in two years when there's coalitions of coalitions?
12/1/2008,"i have to disagree there, keeping standings aligned alone is a good amount of work and a serious problem if you need to deal with threads within minutes. besides that this work is needlessly multiplied with each member alliance. i<U+FFFD>d like to see something that:-allows to share standings between the members-ability to explicitly not share/autoupdate specific standings-empire wars should remain on alliance level and be possible within the coalition (civil wars anyone?)-maybe some extended pos access patterns (jump bridges, cynogenerators etc... for easier management)it shouldnt do much more in my view, just make management easierand not enforce too much equalization as i see its biggest strengthin enabling its members to keep their identity while being aligned tosomething greater.this would definitely make things easier and most important, more fun as we spend less time onboring stuff and have more time to shoot things.supported."
12/1/2008,"1) wars should be overhauled. for the most part war decs are used as a griefing tool and i don't think that's what they were meant to be. a war dec should come with a set of goals. such as 2 battleships, 10 cruisers and 20 frigates. (t2 ships fall under their parent category. a curse is a cruiser) the corp that starts the war sets the goals. if the goals are met the war is over and a new war would have to be started. if the goals are not met then the corp cannot start a new war for 30 days. the corp that the war is started against may create a set of goals (at least of equal value as the aggressors) and if those goals are met then the war is over.2)skill plan queue please. (yes there is a giant thread about this, i'm just adding my support to that thread.)3) all this technology and we can't splash some paint on these ships? i understand the limits of an online game like this. (and oh god the lag this could cause in a fleet battle) but if you make it something that you can toggle off (like turrets and missile effects) and if you gave each ship a combo of 3 light colors, 2 main hull, and 2 secondary hull colors you would drastically improve on the variety in eve4) why is there nothing available to jam drone bandwidth? a new section of ewar that cuts the drone bandwidth of a ship would be a logical edition to the game. basic modules would be able to cut 25% of the bandwidth. having the skill related to level v and a meta 4 or better module would be able to jam 100%5) out in 0.0 space those planets have got to have some people living on them. and if an alliance has sovereignty over those planets then they would have to do things to keep those people happy. such as killing the local pirates (ratting) or building stations in planetary orbit that help the locals. if an enemy alliance tries to attack the system and the locals have good standing with the occupying alliance then they might muster some defenses to repel the invaders. of course the ships they can muster would depend on the stations in orbit around the planet. of course if the locals don't like the occupying alliance then maybe some of the employees working on the pos' or stations, manage to sabotage the shields. just look at what happened to those caldari corps that treated their workforce poorly for too long."
12/1/2008,"agreed that this is a pay-to-grief mechanic. ccp is currently looking at options for the wardec mechanic, but it's something that's gonna take a think tank to figure out, as it's a sticky subject.ccp has the right to set up their game however they want it. while having a skill queue makes sense, and i'm in support of the queue, it's their right to set it up how they want it. this is their fantasy/sci-fi world. we just pay to play in it.seven colors would add an intense amount of lag to the game, but i wrote up an analysis which wouldn't take much and still give us quite a bit of personalization. it's linked with my signature if you would like to view it.that's like asking why we don't have a module to put all high slots on a ship offline. drones is one of the weapon systems of eve, and has the same penalties and advantages as others. admittedly, the drones still attack when a person is jammed, but you can kill the drones to counterbalance this issue.i've written about this under my system security changes part of my website. i look forward to giving alliances more ways to defend themselves and their terrain while not making it completely one-sided. i also encourage small-fleet battles rather than the current blob mechanic.over all, you have a lot of good points which are well known in this community, so i do support this (but not all facets of it)."
12/1/2008,"allowing alliances with differant levels of sov to anchor defensive structures at gates would go a long, long way toward defining 0.0 'empires' and 'factions'. the higher the sov, the more and bigger defensive structures they can emplace.one structure, for example, the ultimate defensive emplacement requiring max sov, would be a cloaking system denial device (just like the ones used by empires to prevent their faction enemies from cloaking). of course, it has to be anchored at a gate, well away from pos tower defenses and reliant only on the curtailed defenses anchored at the gate... or the swift response of locals.of course, they will need yet another logistic chain to load and fuel the defensive structures... unless they magically draw resources from a pre-defined pos.this would then have to be looked at to streamline yet more logistics, which is currently a massive choke point and chore."
12/1/2008,"the best option would be to move war declarations under a mechanic identical to the current contract/escrow system. the declaring corp sets the terms for nullifying the war (items, isk, ect). defining a set number of targets destroyed is not feasable. the declared corp then has the option of meeting those terms, cancelling the war in a very short period of time (30-minutes, for example) and cannot be declared by the original corp for a set period (1 month, for example), or they can set counter-conditions that the declaring corp can agree to (all conditions would need to be met by both sides to end the war short of the duration cycle) or not.agreed. i don't want dual training at 1/2 speed or the like... i just want the ability to define the rollover skill(s) i want to train when the current one completes. well, paint won't dramatically increase the lag so long as the patters are pre-defined in the manner current character portrait and corporation logos. you select a pattern scheme and color value (from the pallette, not rgb) and voila. the 'ship icon' does not change (a thorax still looks like a thorax in showed items, until you 'activate' it or 'lookat' it).paint pattern schemes would fall within factional themes, however, rather than being global.custom schemes and decals, however, would cause massive lag and make eve look like secondlife in short order.as bunyip said... you can blow them up, which is a very effective, and permanent, jamming mechanism."
12/1/2008,the idea is to automatically create auction contract for contents of abandoned corp hangars - for example if a hangar was not paid for for over 6 months.auction contract is public and could be longer then usual(maybe 1 month) and have price start at what you'd normally have to pay to reopen this hangar.if there were no bids on auction then the stuff in it is discarded.this idea has additional benefits: 1) db no longer needs to keep contents of all those long-abandoned hangars.2) spending isk on these auctions also acts as an additional isk sink in the game.
12/1/2008,you sneaky snake.
12/1/2008,nice idea
12/1/2008,"this is an interesting idea.i'd like to ask you to consider over a few points:1 (a) do you think this may lead to less fighting over lost stations if a response cannot be raised within 6 months?1 (b) if you answered yes to 1(a), do you think that this is a good thing?2. do you think this is fair to people taking breaks from the game, to find that their assets have been sold off without their consent?3. (a) if it is the most powerful entities that can lock down the stations most effectively, do you think that giving them the facility to get potentially incredible bargains on captured booty would work to increase the gradient between the 'haves' and 'have nots'?3 (b) if you answer yes to 3(a), do you think that this is a good thing?regards,scagga"
12/1/2008,a: give corporate financial officers the ability to 'pay impound fee' and have the corporate assets dumped into the ceo's personal hangar. that way locking down 0.0 stations will not prevent the goods from being safely held without requiring that someone open a new offce to retrieve them.otherwise... it's a decent idea so long as it's a minimum of 6 months of no activity. each month a mail is sent to the corp detailing the location of the impounded goods and the fees to unlock them from impound. if the corp ceo is the only one with financial officer roles and has been offline for those 6 months a junior financial role is automatically assigned to the next eldest/active character in the corp so they can pay the bills.
12/1/2008,love it
12/1/2008,"this is an excellent idea. with the ability to payimpound fee and getting the items moved to the ceo<U+FFFD>shangar it sounds wonderfully complete to me.i think items impounded in 0.0 stations make the smallestamount of all. if its not worth paying the fee, it should be lost.great solution for all corps that went inactive andwill never come back. i remember we had members who deleted theircharacters and then we had loads of stuff impounded across the galaxy.no one cared for it and so it never got released. i<U+FFFD>d go farther: if the items dont sell after a month, finally delete them.supported!"
12/1/2008,"yes please.hell, make it 3 months."
12/1/2008,o0o nice ideawould like to see this as a station manager option in outposts instead of automatic as with npc stations but fantastic and fun concept!
12/1/2008,"i support this. sounds like a viable method of clearing out ""clutter"". six months sounds good - and who knows, paying impound fees might be a new way to wealth and riches ! ak"
12/1/2008,fully supported.
12/1/2008,"now this is the right train of thinking. lowsec needs to be more valuable to live in, preferably done in connection with making highsec less profitable (moving all l4 agents to lowsec would be a good start). yes, it's more targets for the pirates, but with actual people living there, it'd be a much more interesting situation.fully supported, and it's nice to see something along these lines instead of the usual ""make lowsec safer"" nonsense that comes up more often."
12/1/2008,"it's simple geometry. the current restriction makes designing transportation networks rather messy. to create a y junction (wye) you need multiple systems close together, and the network will be broken by normal stargates. try it yourself under the current system.this proposal would continue to limit sovereignty 3 systems to 2 bridges, but would allow sovereignty 4 systems to have one additional jump bridge.essentially, the only thing that changes is that constellation capitals can serve as wye junctions within jump bridge networks.remember sovereignty 4 systems requires constellation sovereignty, which itself requires three outposts and sovereignty in multiple other nearby systems (a massive logistical investment).in short, adding just one additional jump bridge in these hard-earned sovereignty 4 systems would solve a logistical annoyance that currently can only be solved with a rather silly workaround."
12/1/2008,"nah just remove jump bridges , soon stargates wont be needed as the jump bridge trend looks now."
12/1/2008,you'll always need stargates for region jumps.

12/1/2008,"they were intitally designed to be the hull tankers of eve... just look at their structure points compared to the other races. but ccp completely ignored the idea of hull tanking from the outset... heck, it took them 4 years to indrodues remote hull repairers!ccp, get this fixed.a - reduce cap required for fitted and remote hull repair. increase remote range by a factor of 200.b - don't reduce cycle time (currently 30 seconds), but increase amount of hull repaired to be equivalent of an armor or shield repair module in the same time frame plus 10-30% more effective repair. in other words, if you can last out the cycle time you'll get back a massive chunk of hull.c - remove the onerios' tracking computer and drone bonuses and give it a remote hull repair duration and quantity amount. don't give it extra hull rep range, making it an 'up close' logistic ship unless it's doing armor repair. leave it with the curretn 50m/3 drone bay, however. make the onerios relatively slow for cruisers, but make it solid (hull hp & quantity bonus).d - allow hull repairers to repair damaged modules (either overheated or battle damaged). make damage to hull cause damage to modules as well during the course of battle (currently modules are only damaged by overheating or when the ship is destroyed)."
12/1/2008,"okay so as topic says rr shield vs rr armori think rr shield is completly useless if you concider in rr armorbecause:- ships have better armor resist without any mods fitted by 20% more armor resist if you sum it up- damage controll gives more armor resist than shield resist- armor resist mod called energized adaptive nano membrane is a passive module giving 25% resists with max skills ,while invulnerability field gives 30% , so when you fit 2-2 you get about the same sum resists for shield as for armor , but invu field is active module eating 3.2 cap/sec + higher cpu use ,and can be offlined when neuted, makes it useless against a competent enemy ,which would neutralize your cap for easier kill-ships tend to have more low slots than med slots, making armor tanking easier-3 races can field armor tank easily and only 2 races can shield tank even the caldari bses have 5 low slots making it able to fit an armor tank for rr-rr bses can survive until rr armor runs its cycle ,making rr shield insta cycle useless-rr armor module use less cap than rr shield module for the same repaired amount making rr armor mod more cap efficient-and the biggest difference is the fitting:large remote armor repair system t2 48cpu 660pglarge shield transporter t2 154cpu 192pgbses have average 700cpu and 15000pgso use by percentage:large remote armor repair system t2 7%cpu 4.5%pglarge shield transporter t2 22%cpu 1.3%pgthe huge cpu requirement for rr shield mod makes it unable to fit even for caldari bses without a cpu fitting modif i sum this up it is clear that rr shield modules needs a buff.what do you think?"
12/1/2008,while you're at it check rr hull.that needs some balancing as well.
12/1/2008,"yeah, reduce the cpu use a little and i would be happy."
12/1/2008,"i think more information is needed, miss knight. perhaps look at these variables from a different perspective:1. rr shield gives a boost at the beginning of its cycle- objectively it's not useless, that's just your stated opinion- remote-repping battleships are not the only instance where remote-repping setups are used, i've seen shield remote-repping done very effectively in small passively-tanked hac gangs. i've also seen shield remote-repping done very effectively in level 5 missions and complexes. the fact that the boost is at the beginning of a cycle can be a life-saver - less so when dealing with the single example you gave of a group of battleships that might each have over 30k armour hp..2. rr shield takes far less powergrid- you mention that this makes fitting your battleship require a cpu mod. have you considered changing your midslot fit, or are you trying to fit this with a standard fitting? there is no information in this area, so one cannot say there are no 'viable' shield rr setups...there's more to be said, but i'll leave that to later. in summary, i suggest you think about the issue a bit more."
12/1/2008,i think the op needs a buff as shield transporting is fine.i find it's ability to soak up massive amounts of dps in the short term quite formidable.
12/1/2008,"and how do you really propose it be buffed without totally overpowering it? the only 'problem' with shield rr is that more battleships can be armor tanked than can be shield tanked.armor having a higher average resist, by the way, is balanced by not having an active and overheatable omnitank module, and the fact that damage controls are lowslot modules."
12/1/2008,you say large shield rrs are bad battleship modules because they use too much cpu. i say large armour rrs are bad cruiser modules because they use too much pg. it's all about perspective
12/1/2008,"no. i've used both. they have differences, not a lack of balance. armor has more resist total i suspect because it has no passive regen. ditto for the dc bonus to armor. remote shield and armor repping balance is fine.as to pg and cpu reqs, you neglect to factor in the tremendous drain on pg that sniper bss face in just fitting the guns and plates, which btw necessitate pg fitting mods (rcus make me ). i have not encountered cpu problems any worse on my shield tanking bss.really, no burning issue here, pretty balanced imo."
12/1/2008,"while you're at it fix hull repair?gallente were designed to be hull tankers, but repair rates make that wholly ineffective."
12/1/2008,a good analysis of some shortfalls that still exist at present. wholeheartedly supported.
12/1/2008,"agreed.and as a solo pilot, or one in an npc corp, i would want full standings options... i.e. i want to set an entire alliance to -10 after they gank me in lowsec.currently i can't set alliance standings, only corp (or per corp in a greater alliance)."
12/1/2008,i understand what point you are making but even command ships dont really fill the void....im thinking like a mini carrier....drone capability but no fighter capabillitymaybe a 10 heavy or 15 medium or even 20 small droneslarge cargo capacity to support your fleet or ganglarge drone baymaybe be able to fit a few turretsship repair facilities for corp/gang/fleet mates.....
12/1/2008,also to train command ships takes you on a diffrent path to training carriers so actually a new type of command ship!
12/1/2008,basically i was trying to put a point of view across that for me and alot of new players we could be more involved with the pvp sside of eve with a ship like this and also other corps and alliances would have access to a cheaper type of fleet ship with larger capabillitieskinda like a mobile base camp....when countries go to war they have mobile stations with defence and air support abillities this was the niche i think would enhance eve....you know what flame me.....
12/1/2008,"bs sized mini-carriers were being discussed by ccp a few years ago, not sure what heppened with it. until then, the domi does a pretty good job in that role though."
12/1/2008,what your saying is valid however only for gallente.it would be nice to have a dedicated mini carrier style shipccp make this happen please
12/1/2008,bumphow about some more views on this?surely people can see a gap in the market?
12/1/2008,"isnt this the dominix, more or less?"
12/1/2008,or heavier battleships for anti-cap duties that can fit a few xl guns but never siege?
12/1/2008,"how about keeping the orca the way it is in looks, just change the colour and add 5 high slots so you can put 5 strip miner ii's or 5 ice harvester ii's on it. by doing so you would have a penalty of not doing the mining bonuses to others in your fleet when mining. also decrease the cargo capacity and increasing the drone size and bandwidth. basically the ultimate miner/support ship. i think the capacity for the cargohold should be somewhere around 50km3 in size with a drone capacity of 400m3.lets work on that premise and see what we as the community can come up with.atrossoe"
12/1/2008,lets stay on topicthe dominix is gallente....im thinking more in the region of being able to deploy the drones....10 heavy or 15 medium or 20 light....drone capacity 3000m3drone bandwidth ??cargo capacity 35000m3ship repair bay 80000m3low slots 7medium slots 6high slots 5turrets 3missile hardpoints 2the ship repair bay would allow ships to dock up and repair whilst in battlethe dominix is race specific....the whole idea of this thread was to try and get people used to largewr ships...used to pvp in larger shipsit would help incoperate new people to fleet battleit would be like a fleet auxillary shippeople the whole idea of this thread was to throw some ideas around regarding a mini carrier and allowing new players to be more involved....and also enhancing the learning of fleet behavior
12/1/2008,do you not see such a proposed ship trying to share the role that carriers already play (they're as common as anything these days)...i.e. they don't really create a new role.
12/1/2008,to be honest fleet warfare would be less costly more interesting and more pilots would be willing to fly this type of ship.....battles would be more intense it isn't ness sharing the role but making it available to everyone....
12/1/2008,"a ship that gets you trained a large portion of the way towards a carrier, with a good drone capability and some fleet-support functions, you say? it's called a sin."
12/1/2008,repeating your opinions doesn't make them any more convincing.
12/1/2008,"i thought this thread was about orca's and their role as stated in your subject line, if this was originally for the thoughts about carriers and mini carriers then you should change the subject line.off topic, gee. i think your the one off topic here."
12/1/2008,i think what this guy is asking for is an empire station-hugging sub-capital for ganking war targets with drone swarms.nix.
12/1/2008,thats just lame. you can use a carrier in .4 space for any militia engagements so why need an empire mini carrier.atrossoe
12/1/2008,"given some of the really odd bugs that exist at present(e.g., if you have two windows open and jump, it'll shift focus from top to bottom, which has led to me typing a lot of random half-sentences in local), i'd be all for this. that said, make sure noob help is not lockable, so that there's no idiot who locks himself out of being able to find an answer."
12/1/2008,this should be a very simple yet useful thing to do.with the current description on the tactical shield manipulation skill it's easy to misinterpret what it does. just change it a bit so it's clear that it doesen't make your shield invulnerable but lowers the shield percentage at witch damage starts leaking through into armor.
12/1/2008,supporting my own
12/1/2008,we need more variations ^^ i for one a crystal skull
12/1/2008,what are you talking about? pods compete with interceptors and shuttles about the hardest to catch title (except for ships that can warp cloaked).
12/1/2008,"judging by this and the sticky, i'm really going to like oz as secretary, i think. one request, though - can we get the chatlogs put up in a format that has word wrap on? moving back and forth to be able to read everything is lame."
12/1/2008,"could i clarify, as i believe what i asked was slightly different. what i asked was whether it be possible for csm members to confer with a relevant ccp dev prior to making/escalating proposals that would either be impractical as well as already known, and thus be a waste of csm+ccp time."
12/1/2008,look for us in deep 0.0 in the middle of bob space...issler
12/1/2008,mostly because we abuse the hell out of the npc corp system by running all our empire logistics on unaffiliated alts
12/1/2008,voted for lvv cuz hardin let me down.besides i like the way lvv is being present on the forums especially being in front of ccp's face a lot.
12/1/2008,"sophie daigneau because he (she? it?) really knows industry. if you are serious about industry and didn't vote sophie, well, you weren't really serious."

12/1/2008,"you really don't understand patriotism, do you?"
12/1/2008,"6) trolling and bad player behavior is contagious. especially when little or no action is taken against them. some players genuinely find joy through ruining the fun for others. it's vitally important to both recognize this sort of behavior and take appropriate and timely actions against it. spare the rod and spoil the child.some stuff which these lolbears consider ""bad behaviour"" is actually part of so called roleplaying for others. people can have their ethics from 1917 but they dont need to force them on others tbh."
12/1/2008,no u!!!
12/1/2008,"bunyip, i don't think anyone wants this thread to turn into a discussion of your topic. please post a new thread in the assembly hall for further debate."
12/2/2008,"omnidirectional tracking link i is the drone module, this is the t2 version. the name is fine. adi 5 is a horrifying skill - i don't think anyone but the oldest and most bored of carrier pilots actually has it. make the skill req i/iv and i'd like it more. also, be careful about how good you make this module - it can get op pretty quickly. on battleships it's naturally balanced, since so few battleships have spare highs(really just the five marauders), so it's be used for weapon type shifting. when it goes to cruiser sizes, you're adding a pile of dps instead. watch it. i actually kind of prefer it the other way, but i don't care very much. no, it affects all of them. paint size, web speed reduction, ecm strength, td penalty, and sb penalty. don't name it after one. sure, i didn't catch that. i assumed that might be the case, but i made the proposal anyways. if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. utterly useless. if i'm giving up 300+ dps, i want to get more than half the effect of a single mid-slot module on a frigate. also, these effects are stacking nerfed, so it's more like 270% than 500%. remember, a rack of heavy drones is a lot - people won't give it up for support effects unless the support effects are big too. i don't want more useless hangar trash, i want usable modules. too big of requirements - this belongs in a 1 pg/30 cpu low slot. also, why with the three modules? t2 is enough. not a bad series of changes, and worth considering, but i do have reservations as mentioned above."
12/2/2008,good idea..
12/2/2008,drones are soooooo incredibly under-developed it's not even funny.
12/2/2008,supporting drone love
12/2/2008,drones always have been ccp's redheaded stepchild and always will be.
12/2/2008,yes drone ships need a little love
12/2/2008,"just fix the explosion radius/velocity a bit ffsim not asking to gank the small crap with my bs weapons... i want to hit the bs for dmg thats more than laughable. even blasters get tracking help from skills... but torps and hams get no explosion radius reduction due to the guided missile precision skillagain missiles were subpar to blasters before the patch... now they can barely hit the mwd small stuff or even worse try to shoot the abing small stuff, whatever that needs to be that way. but trying to shoot your own sized hull shouldnt have massive dmg reductions just because they decided to speed tank by just moving 80m/s"
12/2/2008,"still no reply from ccp even acknowledging they have created a serious problem with missiles.i watched a bs npc speed tank a cruise raven on an 05 character last night. that is broken mechanics, pure and simple."
12/2/2008,"missiles are fine. the other day i flew my ares out 170km to try and tackle a pirate cerberus. before i was even in point range, i had to warp out because its heavy missiles, which previously my ship could outspeed and take 0 damage, were actually landing.they werent hitting for much individually mind you, but by the second volly the cerb convinced me i couldnt hang around. so yes, missiles arnt the full damage suppositories they were before. but you know what, you're able to use them effectivly on more targets. and if you need to incorporate the stasis webbers/target painters that high caliber turret ships have had to rely on to hit small targets at all/for full damage since i've been playing is that really so bad?only exception to this ""missiles are fine"" mantra is the stealth bomber. that's a ship without a purpose atm. its bonuses need adjusting to make it fly for its old role or it needs a new one all together."
12/2/2008,the problem isn't that missiles are doing less damage to smaller targets. the problem is that missiles are not doing full damage to the targets they were designed to hit.
12/2/2008,"i use missles very little but i do have 2.5 mill sp in them. first off they did go too far with the missle nerf but but just a little bit. you complain that torps don't hitt a bs for full damage, turrets never have. at full base speed any bs will be reducing the damage from turrets and now from missles too, and that is fine. the problem is that the drop off is far to fast with missles now to be ballenced. they hit for full damage unless u were going insane speeds, witch was unballenced too. if they tweek the damage drop off formula to start at the full base speed of the same class of ship and continue to drop at half the rate of turrets that would bring them in line. and bring out a mid slot mod to incress exp. veloicty."
12/2/2008,"ok, i know this is gonna hurt but, i do support the missile changes, just not as severe as it ispre patch my amarr buddy could not take a missile user, they hit just too hard, he had 6mil sp at the time and was heavily invested into his defensespost patch he can survive now, so that part of it makes it cool, it worksno for the flip sideim caldari, was flying a raven and scorptested with my raven, with cruise missiles and yes i did less damage pre patch, but i trained up guided missile precision, warhead upgrades, and the other skills associated with it, so yes you can mitigate the missile changes to a pointhere are the problems i see1. missiles do static damage, no perfect shot, no misses either but our range is the end all of hit/miss2. sig radius penalty is only a penalty, tested cruises with 2 points in guided missile precision vs an armegeddon, his sig rad was 327, i hit him for 112, i used my target painter vs him which upped his sig by 27.5%, or at least i assumed, because i hit him again, for 1123. missile launchers tend to have a much worse rate of fire then turrets, again my amarr buddy and i tested this aspect, he does 650-750 every 4.75 seconds with lasers, i do 1800 every 15.3 seconds which works out to roughly he fires 3.2 times to my one, so the damage is equalised out, now this is vs a stationary target so the velocity penalties are not figured in4. explosion velocity is highly wrong, a missile system designed for battleships cant even explode fast enough to hit a battleship, this just seems like a math error on the devs part, probably a minor oversight that we just need to bring to light, from a roleplayers point of view:why would caldari engineers design a missle to kill battleships with an explosive velocity that is around 50% of the slowest velocity of said shipsok, off my soapbox nowall im saying here is the missile changes are good for mission running non-caldari, but now that the system is in place we need to work out the bugsso /signed 50%"
12/2/2008,oh god yes.anything that can help the ******ed pos mechanics.something to help the soul-crushing boredom and enourmous effort it takes to online and run a pos
12/2/2008,"pos and their modules should be player buildable like ships and damn near everything else. new indy market and it counters pos spam as a convinient tactic (since the towers will either have minerals and build timer to create or, if you buy off market, the prices will be player driven so more demand aka pos spamming = untenably higher prices). this then allows for a reduction in setup time as discussed above.fuel, aside from starbase charters, should not be 100% dependant on npc sellers. filter oxygen, uranium, mechanical parts into exploration (or some such thing) to increase their availability generally and convinience in 0.0do something ffs.."
12/2/2008,killing them isn't a barrel of laughs either and it requires a lot more people to suffer. if pos get easier to spam they should be easier to kill. reduced hp for mods and the tower maybe?
12/2/2008,"if you have a scientific background - then conduct an experiment. really simple - for one hour - undock in a mining ship, warp to an asteroid field, mine your hold full, dock, empty your hold and repeat. record your times at each step - and see how much variance is in it.i think your going to find you have anywhere from 3% possibly up to 10% variance... (my own experiences, depended on how motivated i was that day to mine). if you find someone with less than 3% variances over time - you have probably found a macro miner... does that seem a bit more restrained ;)and no - i don't believe the op just wants more people to shoot... he does, however, sound like a miner that wants the minerals to be priced appropriately...ak"
12/2/2008,"being a miner myself i have encountered macro miners, and had to move to new mining systems regularly as they were overrun. now i mine far off the usual shipping lanes, and am quite happy not to see any of them anymore.if you had asked me back then i would have agreed on doing something against them directly. now i'm not so sure anymore. as always there are different points of view - the miner view which would like minerals to be as highly priced as possible, and the manufacturer view who would love to buy his minerals as cheap as possible.macrominers contribute a good deal to the material supply, and while that lowers the overall mineral prices, it is also great for eve's manufacturing community. imagine removing all macrominers tomorrow - module and ship prices would increase, miners would get rich and mission runners would have to revert back to mining as missions would not pay for their needs anymore. pvp players would feel the losses of their ships a lot more too. in the end, that sounds like less fun.i think the decision rests on how much macrominers really impact eve's economy. how many are there really? do they do as much damage as we all think? without a clear answer to those questions, we can speculate all year long."
12/2/2008,half the npcers in 0.0 are macroers....
12/2/2008,"that's an opinion, not a fact."
12/2/2008,skill queue needs to be at least 10 skills deep.there is no reason not to have one now that ghost training is gone.
12/2/2008,"i think the problem with the war dec system, is you cant do anything to stop the war dec.so ofcourse new players, who have just formed their first corp. and get war dec by an experienced pvp corp. either quit the game, station hug or jump boat to npc corp. what else is there really to do? fight hacs in t1 frigs?i do agree with others in this thread, that high sec space has way to good agents. they should be moved to low sec space, to make that more appealing.i dont know why some people, would like to be able to grief someone for eternity in this game, without them being able to escape the griefing in any way. neither do i understand why high skilled pvpers, reside in high sec space, they should be in low, or zero sec systems, fighting real targets that actually shoot back.also if you need more pew pew, fw is also a good option."
12/2/2008,"but it is... dam, someone better alert ccp immediately! its obvious they don't know whats going on in their game... that they designed . . . and coded... and, like wrote... and have watched for five years... i'm just sayin...ak"
12/2/2008,"the circumstance, that 3 year old mission running carebears are safe from harm if they wish, is fine. everyone makes their own choice. some people like pvp and go to low sec or null sec, other people dont like to pvp. forcing people into pvp, that do not wish to pvp is a bad idea. its like forcing pvp people into mining.personally i find thoose ""pirates"" who complain about not being able to attack mostly denfenseless pve players pretty laughable. if you are a pirate and want to pvp, then get some balls and approach a real fight."
12/2/2008,"no pos, no shared hangar, no people to fight alongside you when you are attacked, no people to helps you when can flipped, ecc.stoned, you are a curious blindness to the drawbacks."
12/2/2008,"so again the ""solution"" is the one man corp. even more uneve than the npc corps. btw: wardec a one man corp and he will close it and open another. return to first square."
12/2/2008,"yes, ""perfectly logic"". if that is implemented the new scam will be to get people to join corporation, get them to log off at a pos or a player owned station with a ship not allowed in a npc corp and then eject them from the corp.""i will buy that carrier you can't take away from the station for 50 millions""or people instantly boarding the ship you leave back at the pos while you move away in your pod to join another corp and be able to move your ship.you should remember that people will be in a npc corp when they leave/are ejected by a corp."
12/2/2008,"you are not forced to pvp, just forced to play by the same rules as everyone else."
12/2/2008,"that has to be the most stupid argument you have presented so far, really npc corp members arn't playing with the same set of rules as everyone else? go tell ccp you've found an exploit and when the dev's stop laughing at you they might even reply to you petition.badly run corps and enforced (which is the end result of your demands) one man corps will sour the gaming experence of many players forced to endure them. but then your concerns arn't about making the game better for the players but only better for the players you approve of."
12/2/2008,"cant tell from your tickers if you are in a player corp or not but i'm guessing not... corporate taxes are automatically deducted from all bounties, mission fees, and time bonus rewards of a certain value or higher. they cannot be dodged and there are no ""goods"" involved. this is the second assembly hall thread i've seen you sarah palin in (eccm vs. drones being the other gaffe). i dont want to make any assumptions about you that are unwarrented, but it does trouble me you're being so vocal on a policy forum in such a headscratching fashion."
12/2/2008,soooooo......you want to make the game even worse for new players? you want eve to leave a nastier first impression on new players? is that 50% retention too high for you?
12/2/2008,even if inaccurate... he has a valid point.taxation is chump change... and means nothing to the greater majority of the pilots out there in eve... and ccp is not likely to warrant a very high tax rate.so why don't you pull your foot out of your mouth and re-insert your breathing tubes before you cut the oxygen off from your brain while flying your ship in your pod.
12/2/2008,"thiso7 @ cbthe biggest issue here that people refuse to acknowledge is they ""assume"" that every bloody player that plays this game for the first time is going to pvp all the way or be a pirate.when in fact the greater majority of them have no bloody idea what they are doing the first few weeks in... and 9 times out of 10 they will gripe and complain and whine and go back to wow and thereby cutting off your nice little hefty profits....this leads to stagnation.... no change... no growth... nothing new... same ol song next verse exponentially rising.you people are so damn shortsighted its disgusting.yes there are major issues and exploits about corp jumping and hiding in npc... but you forget the actual legitimate ones who are not hiding... who have no intention of getting involved.while they smacktalk you and hide off.... honestly that should be a petitionable offense in my eyes.. just to shut them up.but instead you give ccp very little reason or inclination to bother to get invovle with your hypocritical viewpoints.i may be terse and trollish... but you cannot deny the logic of my standpoint.i don't have a solution.... but this is not as cut and dry as ""lets tax all npc corps""to what end?""lets force all players to join a corp or be in a war-decable npc corp""congratualtions... greifing shall commence post haste... let the mass station camping spree begin for all new players who happen to have full time jobs and have little to no time to figuire out wtf your doing and why?sorry... gb2wow doesn't work here.i keep saying... find middle ground... stop tugging everything to one end of the field to the other.but alas... they fall on deaf ears and i get labeled any number of things.such as life in the world of eve."
12/2/2008,still an issue even though it gets suffocated by alot of other spam topics in this forum
12/2/2008,"or have the trade/contract window show crystal damage, ditto with showing drones health."
12/2/2008,"seriously we had another expansion released and yet still no skill queue.this is number one most requested feature to be added to the game, and it received the greatest response of any topic the csm has ever brought up, and yet it's still not in the game, and still hasn't even been touched by ccp. the only response we get is ""ccp will look into a solution...."", or ccp doesn't want it because they think you logging in for 10 seconds to switch a skill is playing the game.the fact that the number one most requested feature, a basic, easy to implement, and a feature that has no drawbacks, still hasn't been implemented is proof the csm is nothing but a big joke and failed pr attempt. if ccp wanted the csm to work, then they would actually listen to the requests of the csm and implent the features that are highly desired."

12/2/2008,well they're wrong. voting for unrestricted skill queue.
12/2/2008,"well, the csm is nothing more than a tool to communicate with the playerbase better. but ccp can still be jackasses and ignore the playerbase completely. like in this instance. i just hope the csm will re-submit the issue with ccp, both formally and informal, as often as they can."
12/2/2008,"1. this capital push deal of sending ship to non-cynos... this isnt going to happen.2. mothership with no fighters? wtf?3. 50,000 cargobay? wow... nyx with 7 cargo expanders has 270,000m3 cargo. add in some rigs... epic jump freighter.4. titan without doomsday? huh?5. 75% resists? + damage control + officer mods... what? 100,000 dps tank or something? and we have people complaining now with how many supercaps exist... give them epic tanks and shrike might even be able to keep them from dieing.6. can only fit 5 xl guns? wtf... titans hardly ever use them as it is... but thx for nerf anyway?7. i dont even get this one.they also said no to stacking modules and reloading and firing all at once... but that happened didnt it?"
12/2/2008,"good reason why not? see your final comment in your reply ;) more multiplayer, no more solopwn mobile. the mothership has fighters but they are the ships flown by other players. not by computer ai that never misses, has uniform dps and is pretty predictable...with a not as good range and costs 7-8 times as much as a jump freighter. if you can afford to use it that way and have the friends around you to protect it, more power to you. doomsday's are naff.. for many reasons why, read these forums. fair point, reduce it to a reasonable number but without racial weaknesses maybe. exactly, nobody uses them because they have the dd. so anyone who owns a titan fits it just for dd and the rest of the time it's hidden in a jammed system behind a cloaking device. without a dd, or the ability to cloak, they are going to be used for mega anti big ship/pos dps, as a floating station and/or as a mega anti-battleship blob tool.. (i'll come on to that shortly)well, continuing from point 6. where before the titan had a dd to get rid of a battleship blob trying to take out a cyno jammer, now a titan with lots of pilots docked can be used as a mobile pos. with 20 pilots with starbase defense 1 or 10 with sd2 or 4 with sd5 etc. you have an extra lot of dps to bring to the defence that doesn't involve one person, decloaking then pressing one button, warping off and hiding behind a cloak for 10 minutes... amen"
12/2/2008,"the titan doesn't need anything it just needs to lose ddd and cloak.why does anyone think they need to be more survivable. like it deserves to be able to survive being tackled and focused by 100 dreadnaughts, please!titans are ******ed. theres no reason to make them a must-have asset. the idea that they take skill to make so they should be overpowered is stupid. they are just another ship. if you remove the ddd and people deem them unworthy to fly because they cost so much, then they cost too much boohoo."
12/2/2008,"doomsdays are the dumbest thing ccp has introduced since the t2 bpo lottery and hiring t20 (who, iirc, was responsible for the t2 bpo lottery, too)get rid of them already i am a mitten and i approve this message"

12/2/2008,give personal hangers to be dropped at pos's and password those... or divide up the hangers or something.course at that rate you might as well get your own station.... but still.that makes more sense then this proposal.
12/2/2008,", corrected ship nameafter a discussion with gm nova and toka ji via the ingame petition system, they suggested i post my idea here. the backgroundif you know how ship trading scams work, you can skip to the next section. otherwise, please read on.when trading ships in-station, they will retain the name the player has given it. so if he named it ""betty"", it will show up with that name. that's actually a nice feature. however, opening the info window for that ship will _also_ display the ship's player-given name (""betty"", for ex.) instead of the usual ship type (like ""drake"" or ""maelstrom"").scammers use this behavior of the info window to dupe players into trading ships that are not what they seem. the most common scam is to disguise a tier 1 ship as the faction variant. for example, a regular vexor will be named ""gallente navy vexor"". now if you open the view info window for that ship, it will say it's a gallente navy vexor. the only way to see that it's not is by reading its description and of course if you know how the ship icon should look.even once you have the ship in your hangar showing the info window still displays the ship's user-given name. the scam usually breaks once you repackage the ship, and the regular ship name appears.the issuei think the way the view info window works when trading ships should be changed. displaying the player-given name of the ship being traded instead of its true name breaks the mechanics that are in place everywhere else in the game. the feature of trading a ship with its name kept intact does not have to be removed - but the info window should _always_ show the same information. otherwise you never know what to expect.i believe a lot of scams could be avoided that way, and take some load off the gms that process the related petitions.an idea would also be to display the player-given name of the ship in the info window, but in the same way a character's title is displayed below the character name. i'm not sure, but this should be the same issue for all nameable items?"

12/2/2008,"lol, i did not even think twice when i wrote that down. fixing it now, thanks for pointing it out :)"
12/2/2008,"dear ccp: i am trying to learn all i possibly can about eve. in looking to do so, i browse through all of the items and ships examining their aspects. recently i have browsed through the ew in ship equipment. in this category i inspected the warp jammers. i have seen many modules you can use to warp scramble or jam a person in space. however, i have also looked into the way to counter-act that action. to that end i have only come across the module called warp core stabilizer. to this i suggest a new module to be placed into eve. my proposal is that you add a module called a remote warp core stabilizer. this module would act in the same way as the remote armor or hull repairer. with the same requirement of locking onto a ship with either warp disruption or jamming occurring. then once you activate the remote warp core stabilizer you can disengage that disruption or jam from that targeted ship. for an example ship for this module to be best applied for are the logistic ships. these ships are deemed as the support cruisers. with that title i would assume that those ships can assist other ships with any type of problem. these ships are designed to help out with repairing of the shields, capacitor, and the armor. with the remote warp core stabilizer it could help make the logistic ships be more useful in large fleet battles, or even small battles such as two players versus two other players. in any case, this new module would allow players to not rely on the warp core stabilizer alone to get them out of warp jamming situations and have to suffer with the consequences of 40-50% off of their targeting range and scan resolution. if you have already considered this module for use, then here is some motivation to help.sincerely, tassadar_gantrithor"

12/2/2008,there are times i get so mad i say things... then i decide to not use those phrases.i also tend to miss key statements phrases that indicate that the logic of the proposal is flawed.but i honestly still feel its a valid proposal.ecm is a random effect tool... not as constant as a repper.so i'm going to keep quiet and just sit back.
12/2/2008,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.perceptions:-doomsday devices are retarded.-titans are still valuable logistical ships without doomsday devices.goals:-to removed the retardedness of the doomsday device.-to not propose alternative possibilities for doomsday devices. (baby steps) fear not though, as any alternatives would go though actual analysis and design balance, steps that the current doomsday device skipped.proposed solution: remove the retarded doomsday device from the game now. argue an alternative, if any, later."
12/2/2008,did you actually put any thought into this?the whole point of a titan is the doomsday device.... otherwise its just an overgrown mothership is it not?
12/2/2008,"this post takes exactly the wrong approach - alliances don't invest that kind of cash because it makes their logistics a bit easier. you need a replacement doomsday before you take away the current one. you need a solution to the problem, not just a new problem."
12/2/2008,"i am not going to argue what the titan is supposed to be.what it currently is, is a portable jumpbridge (invaluable logistic value), amazing fleet bonuses, and finally the dddumb anti-support button.for those uninformed of titan's and their role in 0.0 you may want to read some of the bibles written by other players concerning the ddd's effect on 0.0, especially when compounded by cyno-jammers. but the nutshell version is that they encourage blobbing and make 0.0 politics more static than it should be. when i can evaporate most of your support fleet with 1 button depress, you encourage people to only bring ddd dodge-able or tank-able ships. if you are neither then too bad, you don't deserve to participate in 0.0.so i won't argue what it should be. i have read 100 different ideas for it and i guarantee you that the csm will never agree on 1 single alternative.but everyone generally agrees that the use of titans as a 1-button-anti-support-fleet-button is a pretty ****ing aweful one.if you want me to propose an alternative, tough **** i dont want to. nobody would ever agree on it eitherways.instead i challenge you gois to look at the ddd as if it did not exist and the titan only had jumpbridge and fleet bonuses. would the csm or playerbase every agree to introduce a 1-button-anti-support-fleet role to this fantasy titan? no ****ing chance!"
12/2/2008,"yeah either change how dd damage is calculated or just trash the whole idea.uh... forgetting the jump portal generator?false. titans are used much more often for the bridge capabilities than their doomsday. they make non-combat logistics a little bit easier, but they have a gigantic impact on long range offensive strike capabilities."
12/2/2008,"i do not know how familiar you are with the ddd, but after having about 100 ships lost to the ddd, you stop ****ing caring why an alliance spent $5 on their goddamn titan.no, you don't. you don't leave the gain green infected leg on the patient while arguing over what kind of material you want the prosthetic made out of.the ddd is an aweful idea. it has no place in eve, it should have never been introduced. ccp may totally decide to readdress the roles of supercapitals 10 years from now, but in the meantime ddds ruin 0.0 right now and need to be removed right now."
12/2/2008,the doomsday is a silly device.
12/2/2008,"sounds like he just lost his ship to a doomsday device.ok so i didn't know about the uber jump drive on the damn thing.regardless.. aside from the uber jump drive.... its still a big f'ing ship with mom capabilties and other fun little things... the largest of which is in fact a doomsday device.for cryin out loud people... its a flying death star.... the damn thing takes out large groups of people with total lack of regard as to the actual damnage output... hell if i had it my way... i'd say nothing would survive a ""ddd"" shot... hence the name doomsday!if they are that big of a problem... make them harder to build...longer to train far... and astronomically expensive.no i don't have any experience with one other than fact that titan pilots are paranoid^10but i do know that what your proposing is totally off the damn map...never mind the grid.a little less bias and a bit more focus towards balancing and not nerfing."

12/2/2008,once i learned that certs don't do anything i stopped caring.i agree with you but i don't think that certs are important enough to even be recognized by players as it would be a complete waste of developer resources.
12/2/2008,this tbh
12/2/2008,they are a waste of time to people who have played eve long enough to not care.those who are new to the game however can use it as a reference point/guideline for getting them started on the right track.... then eventually going off on there own planned routes.but you didn't think of that did you.: o )

12/2/2008,"hiin eve there is a problem. players feel alone and only see friends in chat windows and in space see just metal. part 1 of this solution. i think there should be a new type of npc. space animals like perhaps big space whales. this will add new dimension to ratting and also some good sound effects when they mew.part 2 of the solution.make a new set of skills under the heading creature handling. players can train up in space animal taming skills and through isolating a space whale from its other space whale friends it can be made to be friendly and open to orders. from here the space whale can have its own interface box like drones. so it can be told to go do things such as fly to a gate and report/mew if it sees hostiles.this also opens up the possibility of having anti space whale units. such as nets also when ambulation is ready we could add taxidermy professions so that our favourite pets corpses can be put inside so we can remember them.i think we need careful thought about which of them can breed. so some species can interbreed but some can not and also when the breeding can happen. creature tamer corporations can maybe open adoption and rescue centres so strays and unwanted space whales can be saved and given to new owners. perhaps even helping ones who have known nothing but fighting and being used by fleets their whole life so that they can go somewhere quiet to fly about in their retirement with their friends. also maybe a new class of ship is needed which is fast but gets respect from the space animals so that the ship can herd themwith this solution in place eve players will feel they have a friend in space who is always online when corp chat is quiet, feeding it and growing it and would get lots of new players to the game aswell"
12/2/2008,"i approve of this idea, space is far too lonely as it is now."
12/2/2008,there could even be a skill to train your pet to attack enemies with its teeth.this is an awesome idea. id love to see it put in :)

12/2/2008,"1) coming back after 6 months solely for stuff locked away? doesn't seem to be a very common case anyway.it's not like stations are now taken over in a second before anyone can react to move stuff(even if it's to personal hangar).2) it's for corporate hangars, not personal ones, if nobody from a corporation was around for 6 months it looks very much like a dead corporation.3) while it may benefit large alliances, but i doubt it's incredible riches for taking station from enemy and holding it 6 months, compared say to moonmining for dysprosium for 6 months which requires about same effort. and just think of the drama of bidding wars - anyone who can dock in that region can place bids and everyone else can't see who did it. spies, citizen corps, random characters forgotten in stations, all of them can enter bidding war and drive price far,far away from ""incredible bargain"""

12/2/2008,this has more support than my first initial value-adding idea.voting for the lulz~
12/2/2008,"deaded - moving lvl 4 agents is not going to help low-sec by an appreciable amount (imho - ymmv). making hi-sec ""less profitable"" will not move the majority of people (i believe).what everyone is talking about here are ""risk averse"" people. moving lvl 4's out of hi-sec is just going to remove liquide isk from the economy, its not going to help low-sec. if removing isk from the economy is ccp's goal, well and good. risk averse people will not move out of hi-sec just to follow lvl 4 agents.there has to be a reason to move to low-sec. there has to be something (besides the pvp) that can't be done as well/better/safer in hi/0.0 sec space - people have the opportunity to run lvl 5's in lowsec now. very few do. mining can take place in low-sec - its not done that often (in my experience - when i fly around ratting - i don't see miners).it doesn't help low-sec that the perception of many hi-sec dwellers is that there are only two security levels in eve. ""safe"" hi-sec, and ""dangerous"" everything else...if the goal is to make low-sec more attractive to empire dwellers, there has to be some reason (other than pvp) to go there... and right now - there isn't..."
12/2/2008,"i like the bonus to corporate tax income idea. fluf wise, the empires are encouraging capsuleers to kill off pirates in their border areas by providing cash incentives to such organizations. the piracy problem only exists in its current, carebear traumatizing form because anti-piracy is practically pointless as a profession. some people will do it out of their sense of justice but because you cant make isk efficiently doing it, most pirate corps go along their merry way without encountering their natural predators. so what does clip the pirate wings besides boredom? it's when another organized pvp group finds itself needing to go to lowsec or when combined-arms corps become determined to carve a niche. examples of the first are if my merc corporation had to move from one side of lowsec to the other to get to a target; if there's pirates in the way we'll fight them. sometimes we lose, sometimes they lose but they are challenged. another is when 0.0 alliances need to secure their routes to empire for hauling runs and the like. the second instance is what currently happens not because of risk/reward, but in spite of it. some indy corp recruits a pvp wing and is determined to get the better ore/ice and use their new pvp wing for protection. it's my experience this is the most common non-antipirate-pvp corp type that tries to make the lowsec transition. again, small numbers of these groups and they have a hard time holding onto members or the desire to be in lowsec because of frustration. never the less, if developed enough they can give a fight to some pirate gangs.when more *organized* groups of non-pirates become active in lowsec, it will naturally balance out the pirate population. the pirates will get the fights they want, and people entering lowsec will have less chance of pirates running wild. people will still be ganked, and people will still need diplomacy because surely not all the non-pies will appriciate you mining that hemo they had their eye on, but it will be more balanced.make anti-piracy a viable profession via a redesign of the player bounty system, make lowsec more desireable via a bit more high sec agent reduction, increase in tasty lowsec ore, increase in sexier lowsec rats (maybe the chance of a bs in a .1 sys), make lvl 5s more attractive, go w a bonus of some % to corp tax income, and finally tweak ""garbage"" 0.0 systems to circumvent the desire for 0.0 alliances to swamp lowsec."
12/2/2008,"increasing the rewards out in low sec will only translate into a handful of wealthy(er) vets. it will not bring the carebears out into low sec. they will settle for l3's and terrible ores if l4's and good ores are removed. as i have already stated, increased financial gain will not bring the bears into low sec.the main problem is pvp. i'm not saying it should be dumbed down or anything like that. instead, as others have already suggested, the rewards for pirates and anti piracy pilots should be increased to a point of both becoming a profitable venture.that's how to fix low sec.oh, and we can do away with low sec gate camping. how do you expect the bears to enter when you've got your guns trained on the doors? seriously."
12/2/2008,"there's bears and then there's bears. there are those players who would muddle through on l1s if they had to. then there's the ones who would gladly take a few buddies in battleships out for a spin through lowsec to do a l5 or two if they thought it was worthwhile. these proposals are not aimed at the former group, because it'd be pointless to try. they're aimed at the latter group, and they will come if the money is there. it's not everybody, but it doesn't need to be. also, people are really crazy about gatecamps. i've done a lot of moving in and out of lowsec recently, and the gate is camped maybe 20% of the time, half of that by a lone frigate. even if you're not in a covops, those are easy camps to bypass."
12/2/2008,agreeing that the reward doesn't justify the risk.3x better and i'd bet you'd see a lot more people risking lowsec.
12/2/2008,"false false false false false.in lowsec:-you have sentry guns (no fast locking ships without an entire fleet remote sensor boosting a bc+)-you have stations (can plant your stuff wherever, dockup when there's danger, etc)-sec status (most gankers will be quite obvious)-no bubbles (this is glomping huge). in most cases you can get a bc/bs through a lowsec gate camp through use of the cloak + mwd trick. blockade runners are basically uncatchable. not so in 0.0.if you take the appropriate precautions, lowsec is very tame."
12/2/2008,fully against all kinds of jump bridge network improvements.
12/2/2008,"the last part would only be true if the large alliances couldnt bring their full blob to bear on any one of those systems at any given point in time. as is, no smaller alliances will be able to take or hold even one outpost via the current mechanics."
12/2/2008,that is somewhat beside the point. fact is that there is a feature in the game which is made inviable due to cost factorsit'd be like having a t2 ibis costing 1mil isk to make but only giving you a couple extra slots. it's a no-brainer to just go buy a t1 frig
12/2/2008,"to be quite honest, i don't think gallente were designed to be hull tankers. i think the central gallente theme is maximum dps and *nothing else*. throwing a damage control on any gallente ship for survivability is just a side effect.i think trying to make active hull tanking effective at all would not really boost gallente since many other ships would be able to use this as well. i think any t1 cruiser would love to get universal 60% resists and an active tanking module when it only costs two low slots.however, i do agree that gallente ships tend to have very little tank and that the 'advantage' of their dps is very overrated. our dps doesn't hit either the explosive or em resistance holes and active tanking bonuses don't compete well with passive resistance bonuses.but i don't expect any changes anytime soon."
12/2/2008,"gallente were designed to have more hull hp, not to actually hull tank. it's a bit bigger buffer, it isn't an actual method of tanking. that said, hull reppers should be significantly less lame than they are now - it should be nowhere near as good as the other two, but less pathetic would be nice."
12/2/2008,i've already posted this in ideas forums.adding hull repping drones wouldn't skew that much besides fixing the current gap.would make repping pos mods way less of a hassle.
12/2/2008,afaik currently there's an issue with internal alliance corp vs corp standings.if your alliance becomes blue to corp x on monday... one of your corps in the alliance might not have got on top of things and that corp x isnt appearing blue. so the pos in 0.0 which shoots neutrals... then aggros that corp x.now there's a whole nap system and such.but honestly... corps should be pulled out of the equation and have alliance standings override completely.i dont think it should be as complex for the single corps or individuals.with that... they could get coding and give a nice new ui and functionality to the standings system. that'd be great.

12/3/2008,"supporting this very much. poses as it stands are a necessary part of the 0.0 game, and there's no reason whatsoever for them to be this tedious to set up. imagine if the only way to destroy poses would be by using a single dread, on one module at a time. that's what the logistics people of all alliances have to put up with, in reverse."
12/3/2008,this
12/3/2008,"i agree the setup also fun the very first time...then gets rather old, after the first time.i will agree that it was hairy when i setup a pos, and moments before the shield came online i had an entire gang warp in on top of my ship open fire... i lived long enough that the shields came online to see the entire gang be push flying outward away from the pos.aside from working with equipment that costs $100's of millions of isk... that the rest was absolutely boringone possible solution is to allow a player who is setting up a pos. to preset them down each component. and then just have them go through their timers on there own. so it still takes the same amount of time to anchor and online as it did before... it just don't require that the player be there eyeballing it for several hours."

12/3/2008,"as can be read in this thread, criminals are once again destroying ships without consequence, even if they are already at -10 security status.the method:* fly into empire in pod* let neutral alt pile up ships in safespot (either with orca or by ejecting)* board ships and fly to belt* activate smartbombs or ortherwise gank some targets* let neutral alt loot the wrecks* repeatapparantly this system allows these players to ignore the limitations imposed by their security status, and are able to attack people with impunity.my personal gripe is not the suicide ganking itself, it is the fact that there are no consequences. the criminals do not lose much because of insurance, and are not affected by the security status hit. it once again is a easy way to make money. a clever use of a loophole in the system, sure, but i'm sure that ccp intends that suicide ganking should have consequences.discuss, and do not hesitate to offer your suggestions."
12/3/2008,get an alt of your own to shoot you with a civilian railgun in the belt you are mining.instant concord bodyguards.
12/3/2008,suppose there was no insurance for npc deaths. then suppose people were using the safespot & eject trick or orca trick to suicide gank people at their own monetary loss. is this 'valid' in your mind?
12/3/2008,as much as i really have a hard time saying this.... that's a good idea.<shudders>

12/3/2008,"what i'm asking is whether or not the op thinks suicide ganking is the problem, or suicide ganking with mitigated losses is the problem. because it certainly seems to me that even if insurance was removed for ships dying to concord, there'd still be people complaining about suicide ganking."
12/3/2008,1. remove insurance for being killed by concord.2. remove insurance.
12/3/2008,has been labelled an exploit from memory.
12/3/2008,"that's the ticket.... revoke insurance... hell.. have concord fine im too.: o )call it a ""gank ticket""""you know how much dps you where putting out there sir?"""
12/3/2008,"i'm doubting they've bothered to write code to look for the pattern, much less investigate them."
12/3/2008,some very good ideas on this forum! what system do you hang out by the way?
12/3/2008,are concord and pend insurance affiliated in game?
12/3/2008,"im<U+FFFD>pu<U+FFFD>ni<U+FFFD>ty noun1. exemption from punishment.2. immunity from detrimental effects, as of an action. sounds to me like they're getting blown up just fine. what exactly is the problem here? oh wait... it's the carebears not paying attention again, wanting to be able to mine in 100% safety.perhaps they're playing the wrong game."
12/3/2008,i'm sorry... but to excuse the obvious fact that they are going to great pains to subvert and avoid punishment in a system designed to discourage ganking... is just begging to get labeled an exploit.
12/3/2008,"it takes a fair amount of effort and setup to pull this off. a lot more effort, in fact, then their target is taking mining/ratting away.add to the fact that not only do they lose their ship but there is no guarantee that decent loot will in fact drop due to the randomized nature of module/cargo destruction, i disagree with the op's assessment that something needs to be done about it."
12/3/2008,"not supported.1. they already get killed by concord, consequence.2. they are -10 so anyone can shoot them instantly, including the defense you should have. 3. they are sitting ducks when they are sitting in a ss with their pod. take and pod em to hell.4. wardec said greifers, though they could all be -10 npc pirates (including orca pilot).5. this has always been available as a suicide gank form, the orca just makes it easier now for non bs's. though it cant hold too many battlecruisers.6. if you have a problem with the concord death insurance payout then please post in the threads that are already about that, not starting your own.7. when the orca unloads ships from its hold, have your own pods dock in them.please stop making it sound like they have free reign to kill anyone just because they get a few shots off before the instant neut, jam, web, point, and wtfdmg. remember ccp just buffed concord against suicide ganking."
12/3/2008,"though not much of one, especially if they scan their targets beforehand. if we can find them. pity pods enter warp instantly and the ships aren't valid targets until the -10 pirates enter them.assuming you find the ss, how exactly do you plan to get a warp disruptor on the pods before they warp away ?note that pods hit warp instantly, and they can see you for a few seconds before you can start to lock them as you warp in.this is an option, assuming they are in the same player corp.why would they be unloading ships with unknown people at their ss ?if i was doing the ganking, i would have multiple safe spots setup in that system and the first time i see another player at one ss, we stop using that ss. yet the suicide ganking is still happening.i'd suggest fixing this by the following: if a pilot is in a ship that is not yet targeted by concord for destruction and has a security status below -5 then if they do something to bring concord down on them, then concord will destroy their ship and pod the pilot.if your at -4.99 and suicide gank multiple ships you won't be podded because although you hit the second ship while you were below -5, you became targeted by concord when you hit the first.this way suicide ganking by -10s can still be profitable, just not as profitable as if they keep their security status up in the first place.also for those of you that got killed by a suicide gank recently i have two questions: - how many ships attacked you ? - what kind of a tank did you fit ?"
12/3/2008,"i'll support this, but how about this idea:anyone with a sec status of -5 or lower gets an instant concord escort upon entering highsec. and if they try anything funny, such as entering a ship in space - pop goes the pirate ship. the npc will cause a tiny bit of extra lag, but wth right?"
12/3/2008,"learn to readif losing a fully insured ship is a consequence of suicide ganking, then losing ammo is a consequence of mission running. if you say they should have ships defending the op, then you just need to use those remaining brain cells. how does it help to have combat ships in a belt when they just warp in smart bombers. before you can kill anyone of them concord does that. but not before all miners are killed.it is just riskfree and consequence free pvp."
12/3/2008,i propose this solution:- concord start podding outlaws- prohibit outlaw clones from being based in high secthoughts?
12/3/2008,"incorrect. it isn't ""instant""people below -5 can safely travel through high sec in a wide variety of ships - blockade runners, paladins, hacs, cruisers pretty much anything. fit i-stabs and you can warp before concord turn up - so long as you don't stop or lag you'll be fine. players cannot lock these ships either.a couple of days ago i watched a -7.2 fly through new caldari(1.0) in a crane with no concord escort. i've seen a -10 in a paladin running around jita. but this all appears to be intended game design by ccp - well, they certainly don't want to discuss agility to any degree.captain thunk"
12/3/2008,remove insurance to anyone killed by concord.
12/3/2008,and one of the oldest in the books :) as for the suicide ganking: i've said it b4 and i'll say it again: remove insurance for ships killed while under concord timer. the concord buff and increased security penalties could be removed again for all i care as long as the insurance thing get's fixed.even then there will be suiciding but it will be more 'fair'.
12/3/2008,"there are tons of setups available where insurance + t1 modules + t1 ship costs almost same as the insurance paid out after loosing the ship so in effect the outlaws are not getting any penalty by doing suicide ganking in the way mentioned by op and they are getting more rewards than the risk taken. so, in short their risk/reward factor is unbalanced and it needed to be looked into."
12/3/2008,"and it still change nothing: smartbomb+enough damage to kill hulks fast and concord make 0 difference for the miners. it is revenge but no defence.as the gankers don't get any real damage as ship loss is covered by the insurance and the loot/salvage from the destroyed ships, it is even a empty revenge.in my eyes? yes."
12/3/2008,"the solution is easy, pay attention and you will never die.but i guess the real issue is that it makes it harder for you to run your macrominers while watching tv."
12/3/2008,"what do you expect by the level of paying attention.someone coming out on top of you and activating smartbombs how much time you think will take them to do that and kill you.also for people saying keep aligned while mining, well mining lasers don't have range of missiles or artillery or turrets and you can not stay aligned and mine at same time without getting out of range of the ore you are mining."
12/3/2008,we already discussed with ccp to remove insurance from suicide ganking. isn't that enough?
12/3/2008,"scan down said ships, steal said ships.no insurance payout from ship theft = consequence!ships getting blown up by concord = consequence!your statementfalse!capiche?"
12/3/2008,"that discussion should have been enough, only thing aggravating the problem is that orca is a popular ship and any exploit related to it are going to become popular as well and then this thing needs to be addressed soon."
12/3/2008,"except for the fact this isnt an exploit and is part of the game... now you may want suicide ganking changed but its part of the game.but remember your going off what the op said and that there are no consequences for the suicide gankers, but infact there are. yes they get alot back with insurance, but not all of it usually. and if you have enough protection, chances are you can avoid the gank.high security space is safer space than lowsec/0.0 its not invulnerable isk printing space that you wish it to be."
12/3/2008,"i would like to ask how this is a loop hole? just because your -10 doesn't mean you cant fly into highsec with a ship, it wont insta pop, concord doesn't reply to your being there, only the faction navy's do, i don't see the issue you speak of, because as it stands you can already fit out a bs jump into highsec warp to the belt and kill the hulk anyway.this is a non-issue issue."
12/3/2008,"given the following:1. insurance is voided when a ship is given to another player.2. player still loses ship that they had to pay for with the alt.it is thus false that there are no consequences. also, the point of buffing concord was not to make sure suicide ganking never happens, but to make it more difficult and/or costly. high sec was never meant to be 100% safe, nor should it ever be.conclusion: since concord response times are now much quicker and suiciders still face equal or higher consequences, this is working as it should.if you are mining without protection or not paying attention to a blinky battleship slowly coming towards you, it is your fault that you lose your ship."
12/3/2008,"you get your security status lowered and your ship blown up. -10 pilots don't get a further sec hit but their ship does get blown up. you get a gcc for at least 15 minutes and are not really allowed in high security at all in anything bigger than a pod.flying tech2 ships is a conscious choice you make. you can fly tech 1 ships and have little death penalty or fly tech 2 ships and receive lots of bonuses but have a huge death penalty. i see no reason why using cheap ships to destroy powerful single enemies is wrong, in fact i would say that is good gameplay mechanics and good strategy on behalf of the tech 1 pilots.can't stand the heat, stay in the tech 1 kitchen. also, stop ***whining*** about suicide ganking. it is part of the game and intended. it was severly nerfed lately and it is extremely hard to suicide gank in .7 and above. also, stfu unless you have actually tried to suicide gank. you don't know what it entails and don't know anything about it. you flat out do not know what you are talking about. there are plenty of consequences. if there were no consequences in suicide ganking as you foolishly think, then a lot more people would be doing it."
12/3/2008,this is the best you'll ever get without ccp adding a system-wide deathray that instantly pops anyone that does damage to another player illegally.
12/3/2008,"well, if a player in question has the lowest possible rating of -10, maybe concord should start podding them. maybe players with the lowest possible standing who want to atone and enter empire space again without being podded could serve time (aka an sp penalty).it certainly wouldn't put suicide ganking to an end nor should it, but rather it would slow down it's repetition by the same individuals."

12/3/2008,"indeed. i stopped flying with insurance years ago because it's just a waste of time for me anyway. lost a bs? whooptiedoo...i can replace it in 2-3 days.also, since dreads and carriers are insurable, elimination of insurance would make them not quite so commonplace anymore, making them a bit more carefully used. also, it would have the side benefit of making cap ships no longer the end-all fleet ship...not everyone wants to swallow a 2-3 bil loss 1-2 times a week."
12/3/2008,no need for a lengthy explanation. no.
12/3/2008,:)
12/3/2008,and what about newbies? griefer destroys their brand new bigger ship and they have nothing but long time of saving for new. no thanks.
12/3/2008,i agree for at least battleships and up
12/3/2008,"i agree to this in principle but disagree in application.personally i would go for full payout for ships lost in high sec, 50% payout in empire controlled low sec, 0% payout in 0.0on top of that 0% payouts to people who's sec status drops below -5, and anyone who's status is -5 or worse cannot insure their ships.lastly you must be in empire controlled space when you insure your ship.basically the insurance companies would only work in the (relative) safety of empire controlled space and would not pay out to known/convicted criminals."
12/3/2008,"i don't agree with outright removal of insurance, but i do believe that your insurance 'track record' should affect your premiums and payouts.actually, i think there is a need for a lengthy explanation. i'm currently too tired to go into one, but i'd outline these points as reasons to discuss why i'd support a move to change insurance.1- insurance can create an artificial safety net for ship prices if minerals are cheap. i.e. if prices fall to far it can be profitable to buy and insure ships then get them destroyed2- insurance keeps isk in the system - it cushions people towards maintaining relatively similar frontline capability as they can continue to afford ships of the same class. this means defeating a rich enemy convincingly is very difficult, and it lowers the bar to flying huge ships3- people complain about capitals online / blobs of massive ships. this is one good way of deracinating it.4- there are no consequences for having a terrible insurance record...wtf?"
12/3/2008,"removing insurance will hurt the economy really badly. it's like removing consumption irl, which we see with the economic crisis: it will hurt."
12/3/2008,you have a point there (though this is rooted in current economic theories). what do you think about insurance track records affecting premiums and payouts?
12/3/2008,yes.
12/3/2008,"yes in the very short turn, but quickly the players would fill the void left and the insurance market would become a completely player driven economy, with different corps offering different policies to different sections of the market place .... just as you helped set up a eve based bank to fill in that void lavista ... don't you think?"
12/3/2008,insurance is bad mkay. or at least make it like in real life. ships which blow up a lot cost tons (and tons) of isk to insure.
12/3/2008,no supported
12/3/2008,i like the track record idea and i still think global criminal countdown (or at least concord) related deaths should default your insurence to basic. complete removal is a no-no
12/3/2008,"no...inusrance needs to stay put.... except for the following:1: criminals should not be allowed to insure there ships... obviously they intend to do criminalistic things with them... why should they have the luxury... the companies that insure there ships should either hike the rates really bad.... or give them a smaller pay out for the sake of ""profits"" if you wana get technical. at a minimum every time they invoke a ""cocordoken"" they should have nothing given back to them... including a hefty fine or something.2: for the newbies... insurance is very critical.... however if you wana get picky... you can graduate them to lower rates as they acquire more wealth and or larger assets so to speak.3: tech 2 ships are worthless to insure.... i'm suspecting tech 3 will be nigh impossible... i never understood this... might as well make insurance impossible there.0.0 is a harsh economy to deal with... from what i can see... alot of what they get is what you can provide with what you got.... that or cargo hauls from empire... i wasn't aware that captial ships could be insured due to there excessive expensive nature.. i could only dream what hte insurance rates would be for those big suckers...i don't think killing insurance is a good idea.and with all due respect... stop enforcing your arguments with real life economics... neither are related and you damn will know it.your talking about fake currency for crying out loud..... virtual in game iskies do not translate to real world currency. if they do... your breaking the rules (coughmacrominerscoughiskfarmerscough)its a ""luxury"".... one that you can opt out of.it won't be the end of the bloody world of eve if insurance is taken away.and as much as i'd hate to see my battleship lose insurance.... as its very expensive to replace... i dare say certain individuals will suddenly start to appreciate the value of there ships without insurance. it won't kill the economy in eve online.... hell it might even actually help as most people dump mountains of isk on ships because of insurance.so i guess in that light i really can't say yes.. or no.both are good..... and bad.i'll sit on the fence for this one."
12/3/2008,"i support adjustments to the insurance system, as there is something imbalanced when losing a fully t2 fitted mega will only cost me 25-30 mil isk after insurance is paid out.moving insurance payout amounts from fixed amounts based on outdated base prices to a floating system that is calculated based on a percentage of the market average could be a start (if programing such a system is possible)."
12/3/2008,"a player-run insurance system is, while interesting, fairly unlike to make up for it.a business does, by definition, aim to make profit. you can't make profit in an insurance firm in eve. the way insurance firms works irl, you basically make a bet with them that you will have something bad to you actually happen, while they bet that there won't. in eve, it's very simple: something bad will happen to you."
12/3/2008,why would fake currency make economics any less relvant to eve? plenty of macro and micro economic concepts can be observed here--particularly game theory.
12/3/2008,"oh i don't deny that... but using it as an excuse and slapping the ""end of the world"" on it is foolish at best.unless you have a macro-economics/micro-economics background and studied it for years...this is about insurance and its function... not about the economy of eve.insurance rates are controlled by ccp... not players afaik.so for you to apply economics to something you cant control.. is a waste of our time."
12/3/2008,just to say no with no need for a lengthy explanation.
12/3/2008,"in case you didn't notice bad things happen to everyone no matter if you live in eve or the real world.your illustration of how insurance works is very very basic and thus quite flawed. insurance companies don't just insure anyone, they make an assessment of the risk you pose and offer you a policy they feel is the least gamble they can get away with.so bad things will happen to you more frequently in eve, the insurance companies premiums would reflect that surely?running an insurance firm in eve would be just as risky as say ... investing in a bank on eve, and it couldn't make a profit???? if anyone is willing to lend me a couple of billion isk then i'm more than happy to test out thet statement.but yes something must be done for noobs so i would suggest leaving the present insurance system in place for t1 frigs and only t1 frigs."
12/3/2008,t1 frigs aren't going to be enough.killing insurance for tech 1 ships will harm every single noob out there.if your going to kill insurance... kill it all.or enforce penalties for concord infractions.
12/3/2008,"dunno what your definition of a noob is but noobs wandering round in t1 battleships, to my mind once they have earned and learned your way out of the frigates they are probably not as big a noob as you think they are. if you find a noob in a bs it's becaused they have rushed to bs without stopping along the way for any other skills, at which point losing that bs will probably be the last reason you quit eve, the first being you couldn't find the ""i win!!!"" button."
12/3/2008,"if only because it will throw the mineral prices into chaos, this is absolutely correct. there are underlying issues with mineral supply and artificial price caps/pressures that must be addressed before insurance is removed."
12/3/2008,the thing is...remove ship insurance... then people eventually dont replace the t1 ships they lost because they dont have the isk.meaning less ships being bought off the market.meaning ships start to flood the market.which wont hurt ship builders... they just then shutdown ship production... so they are hurt by making far less isk; but the real people who get hurt are miners. minerals are no longer bought and those really flood the market.eventually ships become ridiculously cheap...wtb megathron 50 isk.nah what is needed is a decrease in capital insurance values. so perhaps a max payout of 500mil for dreads and 300mil for carriers. that's at max insurance. or whatever value. big capital fights then really really hurt.
12/3/2008,"economist crew checking in.anything that removing insurance does to the economy will only be temporary.definitely supporting anything that phases out npc involvement in eve's markets, making it more and more player run.edit: forgot to hit support"
12/3/2008,"no, no on pretty much all counts.i know i'm a carebear and all that but even i know that you ""don't fly what you can't afford to lose""and no, even if the t1 market slows down by any significant amount, over the medium/long term it won't force bs prices down to 50 isk it will instead force industrialist to make something else or be something other than an industrialist, as you say, which will have a knock on effect on the mining industry, driving miners out of buisness, as you say. which in turn will drive up mineral prices, which will bring miners back into buisness which will force up the prices of ship, which will in turn bring more industrialists back into making t1 ships.and while my reading of the situation is just as simplistic as yours, the questions which is the more realistic? the end of the world or that the markets will steady out and adapt over time?"
12/3/2008,"this. removing insurance is a step towards a purer player controlled market, one of the goals of eve."
12/3/2008,"please forgive me if this is not the right place/way to request the support of the csm on a feature but i couldn't find a more suitable place if there is one.feature:we want logistics in killmails.there are several threads with ideas on how to do it, for instance:logistics ships and killmailslogistics on killmailsthank you very much."

12/3/2008,how about htis then:once the ship is dumped with a psw. if it is not picked up by someone in a reasonable amount of time (could be system sec status dependent) the ship get's towed to the closest station and placed inside the hanger of the guy that set the psw.

12/3/2008,"this just would turn back into tooo much crap sitting out in space taking a load on the servers.1 or 2 instances might not sound bad, but larger picture meh, not wanted"
12/3/2008,no. park it in a station or put in the effort for a pos.
12/3/2008,first of all... you cant really leave them inside pos bubbles anymore. unless you have no pw. which is stupid as it is if you arent using a pw.so really... pw for ship would be for ships in space.how many ships eventually get left at jita-perimeter gate?but then you say ship is destroyable? i can see the loads of crying over that.
12/3/2008,"at least you admit that you have no experiences of getting blown up by a titan. this knowledge makes you look less retarded and more like a roleplayer. which is fine. the idea of one day flying a deathstar might seem glorious and awe inspiring to those who have never seen one, much less been blown up by one.however i believe you would find the reality of titans to be disenchanting.imagine joining a gang of any size (10, 100, 1000), going against a strong enemy looking for a fight. not a simple or easy logistical feat. you think you might draw out an enemy gang, but instead a cyno pops on top of you and the screen goes white/black. then you and most of your fleet are in pods. now experience this everytime you draw the attention of a strong enemy. it was fun seeing the pretty light the first 3 times. yay i died to a ddd! and again.. and again... and again.... ok been there done that, oops, again.....one thing that irl and ingame corporations and politics have taught me is that in order to effect change, is that you must do so in stages.ideally everybody already knows and agrees upon the correct ddd solution. back in reality, most people don't agree on what i titan should be or do. but most do agree that the ddd is a stupid idea, and it is a stupid idea.so we should focus on what most people can agree upon, the ddd is a stupid idea. kill it now, so that it can stop being stupid now. if people can ever agree upon a non-stupid idea for the ddd 10 years from now, great for them! in the meantime, the ddd is a stupid idea right now."
12/3/2008,"i am glad this space in time was wasted because someone was qqing over the dd. the way to counter it, is to blow it up. if you fail to do that, then obviously you deserve to be blown up, over and over and over again. thanks for trying sir!"

12/3/2008,"i'm sorry? did you find out your opponent has brains enough to throw a titan at you when you show your hand?congratulations... tactics 101.... don't pitch in the whole bloody attack force all at once.try scouting first!yeah... i've not seen a doomsday up front.... i'm sure i will if i get that far... and i'm sure i'll be slightly sore... but whats worse? throwing a damn fit over something you can get back in due time and realizing ""omgwtf""... or coming out of it with a smile and saying... oops.. guess we should rethink our plans a bit.somehow i think the titan is far more valuable to lose.so feel honored they threw it at you and risked losing it.if you've been through more than one... talk about bad timing.. and bad luck.so tell me sir.... how many times have you faced the almighty ddd!?eh???"
12/3/2008,"i've been kind to you considering that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. and yet you taunt me? t_tok sir that doesn't know what hes talking about, thank you for your input."
12/3/2008,that.. is the biggest pile of steaming dung i've ever heard.don't waste your kindness on me if you can't even answer a simple question!the fact you didn't bother to answer my question as to the number of times you've suffered such a strike also proves my point.
12/3/2008,i already said about a hundred.. lol?not that it matters. thank you for your input on something you've absolutely no knowledge about or experience with.
12/3/2008,about a hundred???your joking....t.t
12/3/2008,nows the part where you tell me what i'm doing wrong.
12/3/2008,this here is a proper approach to the problem.
12/3/2008,20 is pushing it.. 30 is streatching it.. but a hundred? the ravings of a child.i'm sorry... but thats an obvious exaggeration...as for what your doing wrong?waste of time to go there.
12/3/2008,"i was in goonfleet last year back when if you so much as sneezed in local shrike would remote-ddd you.we weren't playing careful at the time either, was back when i could only fly tech 1 cruisers/bcs/bs.hard to em ddd tank a scorpion t_t people don't blow ddds so la-dee-da anymore but yeah, back then i'd lose a ship a day to ddd on average. i don't have an exact number for you and it may very well be over 100 im not sure, but around 100 is not an exaggeration."
12/3/2008,"you'd be amazed at how many titans are made just for jump bridging. or just for vanity. the **** would you know about alliance motivations anyway?in any case, i think that the op would feel pleased if he had heard a couple things the devs have said about doomsdays already."
12/3/2008,also the op's image is terrible and i question whether or not you were ever a goon at all
12/3/2008,i never actually was a goon.
12/3/2008,"it's been this way for three years, and the patient hasn't died yet. the festering is getting to be a bit much, but that's no excuse for acting stupid for the sake of doing something. you need a fix that respects the awe-inspiring investments of the alliances that have built these things, whether it's a small alliance that bought a bpc and built one or a big alliance that bought four bpos and has 15 of them. they must still be viable ships, worth their cost. i don't much care why an alliance spends $5 on something, but when an alliance spends $50,000 it's a bit of a different story.hell, even i know that you have no idea what you're talking about. ddds have been around in some numbers for over two years, depending on who you've been fighting, and they insta-pop a good number of ships(especially in multiples). you can die several times in a night to one if you're unlucky. 100 deaths is about one a week - hardly unreasonable. oh, the first two or three an alliance has can be justified as bridges. the fifteenth? not so much. and i'm all for vanity, but i prefer there to be gameplay motivations instead of just epeen ones."
12/3/2008,"hi!i've lived in 0.0 space since before the first titan was built. since i moved to 0.0, i've flown alongside a dozen titans. i've fought against alliances that have had two dozen titans. i've experienced doomsdays, seen three titans die, billions of isk blown up.i've never died from a doomsday.i've flown untanked sniper battleships in fleets facing dozens of capitals, knowing that any moment, a titan might show up. and they have, on numerous occasions.i've never died from a doomsday.i've seen how people have adapted their setups, to heavily tanked ships, to fast warping nano-fittings. i've flown all of those myself. i've even seen how an interdictor, a destroyer sized hull, was tanked with just t2 gear, to withstand a level 5 doomsday, in order to kill a titan.i've never died from a doomsday.and, even if i did, so what? get a grip. a 70 bil ship is an e-peen. figure out a way to kill said e-peen and get over it. any titan can be killed, it's just a matter of getting around to do it."
12/3/2008,herschel - ok.... i guess the titan population is much larger than i realized... and i was under the impression a doomsday weapon takes a very...very..very long time to recharge.regardless.... the op's rantings are emo'ed to hell and back... maybe if he took more time to be rational and educate everyone on the nuisances of doomsday issues and less time raving like a lunatic with less than stellar language... i'd be inclined to respect him.however... you also pointed out that its just an multi-billion isk ship the size of a bloody planet [ego] and only those that can afford it can deal with it... and its become a way of life.no reason to go emo over it either.and the last poster summ'ed up my point quite nicely...adapt... and you'll survive the doomsday.i've been saying this since the first day i joined this game... even if the ship is crap.... you can make the best of it... or you can complain and go completely emo over it.its how you use it.... its always how you use it.so fine... there's a problem... but this is completely the wrong way to go about it.that's like saying the missiles are overpowered and should be removed from the bloody game.same thing... and just as every bit as ridiculous.put stiffer penalties on the doomsday weapons... longer recharge times.don't be fooled... i'm sure ccp is watching there logs wiht keen interest.... every time someone drops a titant in the midst of a massive fight.... i'm sure they realize whats going on as well.as those are usually the centers of greatest lag... the very lag they fight... kinda hard to ignore that.
12/3/2008,"there was a change introduced in the qr expansion, that had a very large impact on the effects of doomsday devices in eve online. they no longer kill interdiction bubbles.after qr one titan has already been killed by a conventional subcapital fleet (apparently battleships can be used for other things than as support of capitals).for now that has to be enough. the problem with the nerfing is that it is always taken too far in the efforts to please the loudest voices on these forums. leave it be, see how many more titans get downed because of this dictor bubble nerf./judo"
12/3/2008,"i have a feeling this thread will be closed or something to remove the offensiveness of the original post.the real fix for doomsdays are to give them more allowance but a support fleet role.1. remove doomsday cooldown 1 hour timer. the cap-fuel cost is enough of a limitation in that reason.2. only 1 dd may be fired in a grid per hour.3. if you are in a titan... and there's a few battles going on. you can jump/warp around and fire off dd in those different grids and it's all good.4. if you hit the grid with dd before the 1 hour is up... an artificial blackhole forms. the blackhole isnt large and is right where you are. the blackhole essentially scrambles you and perfectly webs you. you are going nowhere. if only 2 dd have gone off in the grid in that hour. you essentially have to wait 1+ hour before the blackhole dissolves.fire dd at 15:00, fire dd at 15:55. you are stuck and going nowhere until 17:00.if at 16:30 you fire another dd or another titan fires a dd. you arent moving for a good period of time. 5. all supercaps are stuck. due to their mass they are caught by any blackholes also.so the double dd that many alliances use to smoke fleets can still be done... but there's a balance that the doomsday has tore space and created a blackhole. giving the enemy fleet the ability to counter attack as you are stuck there."
12/3/2008,im not sure if i can support that idea.... but i have to say your idea is very.... unique.: o )
12/3/2008,"i think it was well over 100 of them last i looked at the list.it's only a one-hour recharge - there have been fights where one titan has dd'd 3-4 times. agreed, this is a whine thread. more or less true. adapting to op is necessary, but i still want the op to be fixed in the long term. probably true, though personally i favour changing the approach of doomsdays - make them ewar is the best i've heard thus far, though some other decent options exist. ripping them out because they annoy you is bad design, but a change is justifiable. and yeah, ccp is watching, but i can understand why players might try to hurry them along a little."
12/3/2008,hurry along? yes.... nerf them in a quick and rage-ful fashion? no.but yes... can see your reasoning. too bad you didn't make it into the csm.sad times.: o )
12/3/2008,"i am so glad to see that you guys have come to the conclusion that the ddd is retarded.splendid.now i guess you'll now agree on an alternative to the ddd.no?this is my point. (facts)1) csm will never agree on what is the correct change to ddd. this is a fact. do not attempt to argue otherwise or i will e-punch you in the face.2) ccp will do whatever the hell they want to anyways regardless of what solution is presented by the csm, so it doesn't even matter wtf you suggest be changed or tweaked.3) so this leads us to the conclusion that the best thing that the csm can do about the retardedness of the ddd is bring it to the attention of ccp that pretty much everyone things that the ddd is retarded, doesn't belong in the game, and should be removed.4) ccp would just take this as feedback that players think the ddd is retarded and then they themselves will look into how to resolve it.this is why you should thumbs up this thread and why you are stupid if you haven't already."
12/3/2008,"in another thread, someone said they didn't know of one person who logs on to just change a skill, and then goes on to play, even though they planned on logging after the skill change.it happens to me all the time, getting sucked in, so the developers are no totally wrong about that.however, upon reading a particular part, i tend to agree with some sort of change. the part you mentioned about having to log on every couple of hours because of short skills, is pretty significant. i can't always be on solidly, and i don't want to train a long skills just because i don't have time to change skills every hour or whatever. i'm having this problem with my alt right now.it sucks because you don't want to miss training time, but yet, if you choose to stat a longer skill so you don't miss out on training time, you are hurting your character build, albeit in the short term.anyway. the argument i can see here is, well, no one says you have to have skills going 100% of the time. much like the learning skills argument. i for one think they should never have been implemented. the argument is, you don't have to train them. much like you don't have to train a skill at all. you can just sit there.but i think learning skills hurt the game. they help, for sure, but they help waaaay to much. they become necessary to compete in the long run, much like not missing a skill change is necessary to compete now. this hurts the casual player. and thus turns away the casual mmorpgamer.however, a pure skill queue is not the answer. because it is conducive to farming characters. which i think we all agree a limitless skill queue is a bad idea.the most logical idea i have heard is, if you have a skill training, and it is at level ii, if it finishes, it begins training level iii, and so on until the skill is complete. this way, it ends when the skill is at v, which doesn't mean you can just sit there at let it cook for limitless time.it also does not effect the game that much, for instance, take a rank v skill, it takes someone with around a level 20 attribute in the two appropriate fields, about 28 days to finish level v from level iv, from level i to iv, it only takes like 5 or 6 days, so by adding a skill queue, you're only extending the skill change time by about 20% to 25%. which really isn't that big of a change in the scheme of things. removing ghost training was a good idea. not adding a limitless skill queue is a good idea, but a simple, low impact solution to klugy skill timers is also a good idea.for learning skills, for anyone playing the game longer then a couple months, learning skills are a necessity to keep up, which means new players who like the game, must now spend weeks (and months if they want to do it proper) training learning skills.learning skills do not gain access to new modules or ships directly, nor do they make you fly faster, or do more damage. they are simply a skill needed to train things faster, it also is an equalizer for someone who made an unbalanced character build. personally, i think an emphasis on the character build should have more of an effect. not to the point where it's built into classes, but to where you'll be faster to learning some things and slower to learn others. learning skills dampen this.i think they should implement a skill change that completes the next rank in a skill if the player does not change it, and they should remove learning skills.to compensate for removing the learning skills, boost the starting attributes, not to equalize them, but to create a landscape, as opposed to a bar. so if you are making a combat build, you're attributes might look like:perception: 23will power: 22memory: 19charisma: 12intelligence: 16you can skill learn everything, but you'll learn combat skills quicker. you'll be stuck with these attributes, though."
12/3/2008,amen!
12/3/2008,"for you, maybe. for the rest of us, we have things that are more important than eve. like having to go to work after we do an early morning skill change.which hurts the character you are paying for.the learning skills are another issue discussed in other threads. so i'm ignoring anything you say about them here because it isn't relevant to what everyone else it talking about. show me your numbers to suggest that farming a character would worth it in terms of what it can be sold for. remember that you have to pay for all the training time either in isk via gtcs or with cash.so we make a queue with a reasonable limit.how is training skills we don't want is more logical than letting us train the skill we want to train ?how is causing the training to stop any better an idea than one which keeps training going 24/7 ? nor would a skill queue. we just queue up out skills, then continue as we do now, except that an annoyance has been removed. true.what is so bad about a limitless queue ?what about a queue that only queues up about 5 skills ?and continuing to level 5, instead of the skills we want, is not a good solution. especially when i often have level 5 skills ending at annoying times. even a queue that only allowed a single queued skill would be much better than ""continue to level 5"".and there are several possible solutions to the annoyance of the current skill system. continuing to level 5 is the worst of the ones that keeps coming up, while any one of the rest would satisfy me."
12/3/2008,"these things entered the game when there were what 4-5k people on at prime time as bandaids. before there were this many people and ability to build outposts.now we have more outposts than i care to count and conflicts are rife, something the smuggler gates was meant to promote back when travel distances between waring factions was deemed too long.the conquerable stations was introduced to tie people over till outposts came along yet they remain the free ride the outpost is not.it's time to rip off these bandaids.give a one month warning before allowing people to blow the smuggler gates, fighting to keep them should be an option, why not?also give a two months warning before conquerable stations goes destructible, allowing people time to get the hell out of dodge or reconcile with the fact that whatever they've still got in there may go up in smoke any given day."
12/3/2008,...and of course.
12/3/2008,"the idea is simple, right now when you kill a enemy pos, all the modules stay in space. also, offline towers just take up room on moons by sitting there anchored, and must go though the tedious process of being killed before the moon can be used. what if there was a module similar to a salvager (but would take way way longer per cycle, obviously) that would allow you to un-anchor other players poss and modules that were left anchored around moons that have been either forgotten, left un-fueled, or are stranded because the pos they were once on has been killed.this would make people fuel the poss they put up, or lose them, but it will also provide a bit of a reward for those people who waste the time and effort (and skill time) to blow up a enemy pos so they can at least have the reward of having the modules that were around that pos.let me know what you all think"
12/3/2008,once the tower is gone as long as the mods are at full health you can unanchor them.
12/3/2008,can we get something in between alliance and corp as well? megacorp for example that provides some of the tools of an alliance but doesn't gain all the benefits?
12/3/2008,"coalitions chose the hard way to work together, not banding in one single alliance, leave it be.i'd rather see alliance hangars before coalitions get put into easy mode."
12/3/2008,not supported. leave control of standings and other stuff to alliances. fix alliance/corp workings before even trying to tackle coalitions.are you trying to encourage 1 massive unity controlling everything?
12/3/2008,agreed... trial accounts should be strictly limited to the fact they are demo's of eve online... for them to have the ability to do such things should only be reserved for a paid subscriber.
12/3/2008,as long as trial accounts can still accept time cards offers.
12/3/2008,"why do you assume people posting wts at 30% above market price outnumber the people posting wtb at 30% below market price? market manipulation is hard to keep up over the long term. also, the age of a character doesn't tell you whether it's a trial - could just as easily be a fresh alt. gtc prices are going up because more people are buying them and/or fewer people are selling them, not because of nefarious alt posting. and if that's not a good enough answer for you, go buy them in game."
12/3/2008,"afaik, trial accounts aren't able to post in any forum.have you tested to verify that trial accounts can infact post: if they can, i would suggest filing a bug report, as it has been months (years?) since they have been able to post anywhere.your theory about why gtc prices are ""high"" on the forums is rubbish. prices for plex tokens are even higher than forum prices. even still, they are only 5-25% higher than they were this time last year: a tiny margin by eve economic standards. it is not even close to the variation in mineral prices over the same time period. if you want lower prices you're going to need to increase supply or decrease demand.dealing with spam on the forums, particularly on the trade forums, is an on going issue. i would suggest that you start by reporting posts which you can confirm as violating established forum rules. repeated violations should result in account (not just character) forum bans of increasing length.if they are abusing the forums, report them using established mechanics. if the trend continues we can expect to see ccp come up with solutions as they don't want to waste their moderators time dealing with chrononic forum rule violators."
12/3/2008,brilliant and possibly the only thing that can get me to play this game again
12/3/2008,i sense a wow night elf hunter.
12/3/2008,"i oppose the idea.to me space is allready far too croweded in eve. space is supposed to me lonely, not full of freaky attractions.and ""space whales"" ?? are you serious ??"
12/3/2008,"ha-ha, rmt isn't illegal, its only against the eulajames belushi called, he's saying he's no longer the biggest jokes in tinseltown"
12/3/2008,"the state penitentiary called... they want there ""lol-yer"" back."
12/3/2008,"the question isn't why, it's why not."
12/3/2008,maybe a little bit of explanation?(i know what your getting at but what about everyone else : o p )
12/3/2008,"well concidering that grouping your turrets improves tracking and falloff, it would be interesting to see what would happen if they allow the grouping of other modules.improved resistances from grouping hardeners would be nice."
12/3/2008,"this thread already exists here - it's not strictly the same proposal, but aside from salvagers, there aren't too many others that this would apply to. since it's already got 20 votes, i'd put this there."
12/3/2008,"like with the info-windows where you can hold down shift or ctrl, dont remember to open a new instance."
12/3/2008,i support my suggestion.
12/3/2008,this proposal is made of win.
12/3/2008,"i have been away from eve for over 6 months. i use corp hangars for my stuff because it is the only sane way to organise your assets in the absence of personal hangar divisions and it makes life easier to work with your main characters. if i join a 'proper' corp, then my personal corp is just a holding area for junk and items of sentimental value that stack up over the years.your proposed change would have screwed me over in my absence. you might as well suggest deleting all characters that haven't logged in for over 6 months.as the game ages, there will be more people like me that take extended breaks then revisit for a few months. believe it or not, after playing the game for 3+ years, your appetite for playing it can diminish to the point where taking a long break is feasible. one of the reasons there are so many players still around from launch and beyond is the tolerance towards people taking breaks. this, combined with the continuing development of the game gives us compelling reasons to keep coming back."
12/3/2008,"your solution is called a ""station vault""--build a few of them if you want to sort them, and then keep the stuff in your personal hangar. problem resolved, and you don't have to deal with pesky impound fees!supported. makes losing stations that much more painful, and it helps keep the db pruned and healthy. plus it gives the conquering force a chance to get the spoils of war."
12/3/2008,"i, too, want a stab at what's in 0oyz-."
12/3/2008,"terrible idea. this is why snowball launchers were removed. newbs will shoot back and get concorded.hmm, why no down-thumb option. guess no-thumb will have to do."
12/3/2008,"this is not a issue the polaris frigate can not be locked. so basicly newbies nor oldies cant even attempt to fire back. almost forgot to support my own topic!grtz,silversoldier"
12/3/2008,i approve! pew pew the paint balls.
12/3/2008,"items were just an idea to be discussed - and if you would have read a little more attentive, you would have noticed that only good/helpful/resolved bug(-reports) shall be honoured is the csm willing to bring this topic to ccp? it is far from changing any game mechanic, its only purpose is encouraging good bug reports and improving lacks and faults of the game."
12/3/2008,"pretty sure we were promised something along the lines of t2 veldspar quite a long time ago in 0.0 to make it actually realistic to supply ourselves with low ends. as it stands its still cheaper to mine high ends in 0.0, move the high ends to empire, then spend numerous trips running a very large quantity of trit back to 0.0 in a jump freighter via xl torps(the best trit compression rate) i know it's crazy, but you could just give us a veldspar that has 4-8x the yield in trit. beyond pvp, sov benefits, and moon mining there is almost no reason to stay in 0.0. certainly none of it stacks risk vs reward"
12/3/2008,tier 2 =! t2 and i'll have a veldspar bpo please. thanks.
12/3/2008,interesting idea. will have to think about that.
12/3/2008,yes i am completely aware of this. but they refered to it as a tier 2 veldspar and in my mind it would be more of a tech2(except you couldn't really have a high tech asteroid) rorquals are neat except it makes time spent moving the trit from highsec to lowsec to compressing it to moving it out to 0.0 just unrealistic. mining it straight in low sec isn't even remotely worth the risk and ccp seems to be doing everything they can to make it as hard on 0.0 logistics teams as possible.
12/3/2008,"sorry i am not a very organized thinker, i can't make an awesomely formatted post with bullets and all that(lawl goon). just an idea and some blocks of words."
12/3/2008,"endorsing this - if you try to mine anything but ark or bistot you get grief, it is not cost effective use of time."
12/3/2008,"i've read some ideas forwarded to me by nyphur that spoke of integrating 'veins' of better ore in larger asteroids. some other ideas i've been thinking aboutore: following on from nyphur's idea, addressing the fact that ores all seem neatly separatedi think it would be interesting if the ores were mixed together in asteroids, and that there would be minable and non-minable components. the miner would need to target 'sections' of the asteroid. the clever miner would know which areas had the best ratio of ores and mine them preferentially. this system would make it more difficult for miners to selectively remove the entire supply of one kind of ore, and also make optimising mining income more of a specialist, engaging pursuit.for this to work asteroids would need to be:- bigger, much bigger- contain different targetable sections- become heterogenous, with some sections that cannot be minedthe compound asteroids would work to the effect of creating more varieties of ore, in which can be integrated what ed mentioned - whereby there could be veins (as nyphur suggested) of much higher quality ore."
12/3/2008,"what stops y ou from using 8 mining lasers on anything, canceling the cycle 2 seconds in and seeing what ore you get from each part of the rock? (taking all skill out of it just simply making it so you cant mine by labels)edit: in effect the only thing you would accomplish is make mining more time consuming with almost no real benefit(unless you gave a higher yield than you currently do)"
12/3/2008,"let's think in 3d, comrade. your question is quite reasonable as i didn't go into much depth with my previous post. as mentioned, i envision an asteroid has targetable 'sub-sections'. stripping of these 'sub-sections' may reveal other ores lying deeper - similar to mining in the real world, where you may find veins of different minerals. this principle, if applied, could encourage an exploratory approach, in my opinion. they're called prospectors afterall!furthermore you will appreciate that this suggestion works with the conditions i gave - i.e. much, much larger asteroids. it would almost be like digging for oil, or breaking open a stone to find crystals inside.also, you may recall i mentioned that asteroids could have unminable sections - or sections with very little mineral value - it is not just a question of strip-mining everything in sight. thinking further upon this, this can give a different function for the survey scanner. i'll post this in another reply."
12/3/2008,a very interesting idea but you would probably have to change the way things registered in your overview so you were unable to see the things inside from the get go. if they could do this that would be fantastic but in reality i think simply asking for a better yield low end mineral as the limits to what ccp can do on the short term
12/3/2008,"rethinking the survey scanner (with the assumptions of the previous ideas)survey scanner acts in the same way as the directional scanner - i.e. you can set the angle and depth to scan up to. the results would be given in density - with better ores usually being more dense. naturally, the accuracy would be given as a range with a margin of error, which would increase if you were scanning a wider angle or a greater depth. this would guide miners who want to navigate into the 'bigger' asteroids and find valuable ores lying beneath unassuming veldspar, for instance, or who wish to triangulate the parameters of a dark ochre vein they had just found.accuracy would be better with named/t2 versions. this would probably give someone a reason to use a t2 survey scanner (i never found a reason when i used to mine)."
12/3/2008,yes but to make these objects remain off your overview they would either need a way to temporarily hide them or make them spawn as the layer was stripped. somehow i think that would be more of a long term goal and not something to fix just one of the many woes of 0.0 logisticsalso it would require a very expansive change to every belt in the game.
12/3/2008,"naturally, there is only so much that can be done. if this idea is formally written up and gets adequate support it could happen sooner than soon(tm)."
12/3/2008,i agree with you - it's not simple or easy to apply. i do think it's worth turning into a proposal for ccp to consider for the future though. meanwhile if anything short-term comes to mind i'll bring it here.
12/3/2008,"unfortunately i think it's less of what you suggest or how you suggest it but who endorses it at this point. if ccp sees enough of the community behind one idea they tend to put it in eventually. but we have to be vocal and constant. you can find dozens of well thought out, well formatted ideas that have died quiet deaths in this forum. the changes we have seen involved mass public outcry."
12/3/2008,that's true. hopefully our elected csm will pick up on this issue and do their best to give it the publicity it needs
12/3/2008,"the problem with 0.0 compared to low or high-sec in terms of mining is there is a tremendous variation in the risk:reward ratio between the different areas and types of ore. mining in highsec is almost perfectly safe and as long as you're not doing anything particularly stupid, almost impossible to die doing. the downside to this is the relatively low isk/hour made. mining in lowsec has better asteroids full of more valuable minerals, but the downside is unless you're careful, you can get ganked in the belts. this hurts the standings of the person attacking you, but most lowsec pirates don't care. the higher value of the minerals, especially isogen and nocxium, make mining in lowsec worth it in quiet systems. mining in 0.0 nets you the most profit, but it comes at the greatest risk. roving bands of gankers will periodically sweep through your system and attempt to kill anything they can find. thanks to the probing changes you require either a pos, a station, or a cloaking device to avoid them for any real length of time. even multiple safespots aren't proof against a skilled covops pilot scanning for you.the downside to mining in 0.0, is the only minerals worth the effort is the high ends arkanor, bistot and crokite. while very valuable, megacyte alone does not a battleship make. 0.0 ship and module construction relies on a tremendous amount of mineral importation from highsec. this mineral importation increases the costs associated with the ships by several factors, and diminishes the ability of a single player or small group to effectively fight in 0.0. the massive difference in the isk made hourly and the obvious danger involved in sitting stationary in a belt for long periods of time means that only the most profitable asteroids are mined, and only then when players cannot rat or do other things. this means that 0.0 miners will not just preferentially mine the big three; they will only mine the big three. this means there is no local production of minerals outside of rat loot being refined, and that is a very small number compared to the daily mineral spawns in a given belt.this same problem exists for ices as they do for minerals. mining ice in highsec, aside from the off chance that a suicide ganker pops your ship or can, is very safe. a skilled player should never be killed mining in highsec. thus you can mine effectively 23/7 without fear of loss. mining ice in lowsec offers vastly increased risk for no net gain in profit, and therefore foolish, bordering on suicidal, so we're ignoring it. mining ice in 0.0, even with the more valuable ices, still doesn't offer the risk:reward ratio required for anybody to do it. netting 350 units of isotopes per ice chunk compared to 300 units in highsec doesn't incentivise local mining of ice. it's better to import macromined ices from highsec through a convoluted system of relay towers in a jump freighter than it is to have mining ops in 0.0. you make a staggering 15% more in 0.0 mining for isotopes than you do in empire, for 100% more chances to lose your ship and pod.the best way to make players mine for the materials they need to supply themselves in 0.0, is to raise the total value of the materials they mine to be more in line with the most valuable minerals. once the arc/bistot/crokite is depleted, everyone will stop mining and start ratting, or doing other money making activities like missions.the best method of changing the risk/reward ratio of mining lowends and isotope bearing ices in 0.0 is to increase the yield of the raw ore. saturated veldspar, with a yield of 5000 units of tritanium, would be worth as much as arkanor on a volumetric basis, which allows miners to gather low-end minerals in 0.0 while still maintaining the risk/reward ratio that mining for high-ends gives them. the same holds true for ices, using the locally available high end mineral as a guide, adjust the yields of the ices so that at historic marke"
12/3/2008,"as an alt, you can raise issues too. at least we allowed for that during csm1. so get busy"
12/3/2008,awesome someone did a fancy bulleted list with good points for what i was suggesting :) also other avenues to make this more feasible is giving 0.0 stations and pos an innate reduction to the amount of low ends bpo's require simply because of where they are(how you justify this in an rp sense i don't really care)
12/3/2008,"i'd personally love to raise the issue, i am attempting to find someone to help me raise it because unorganized blobs of text are unlikely to get pushed through"
12/3/2008,i'll manifesto it complete with skills and numbers in a few days. finals are eating my ass alive right now though.
12/3/2008,i'd really appreciate that.
12/3/2008,holy crap! i didn't know that!
12/3/2008,i'm interested in bringing this up - we'll be in touch.
12/3/2008,"this assumption is wildly incorrect. you make more isk per hour mining in highsec than lowsec, although technically you could mine veld/scord in lowsec and make just as much as in highsec. the lowsec-only ore is worth less per hour (or per unit volume) than veldspar or scordite because of the differences in mineral prices compared to the npc base values upon which the current ore distribution system was predicated. that was the key issue i raised last year, that ore in lowsec isn't better than that in highsec, it's different. it yields different minerals rather than increased quantities of the same minerals and therefore mining in lowsec isn't inherently better than mining in highsec. it's only better when trit prices are low or isogen/nocxium prices are extremely high, neither of which is guaranteed or currently true.as the opening of the drone regions proved, players will export cheap minerals if they're made available. any change to massively increase lowend mineral availability in 0.0 will have to be met with a massive nerf to standard logistic methods. minerals could be multiplied in size, for example, but then ore compression becomes a logistical transport mechanism. and increasing the ore volume would make hauling for mining ops irritating. the solution in my opinion is to give industrial ships (normal ones) the ability to store ore more efficiently, using a smaller amount of space than normal. so we can multiply ore volumes by 10 but give industrials a sort of 10x compression for all ore they carry. the alternative is to give them a cargo bay and an ore bay, the latter of which could only hold ore but would be massive.there are a lot of ideas to discuss regarding mining. i described some in a thread last year called mining mk iii and skagga recieved a copy of a proposal i wrote on lowsec which contained a portion dealing with mining in lowsec. even though it's looking like i completely wasted my time on that and ccp aren't interested in it at all, they do seem to want to overhaul mining at some point."
12/3/2008,"definitely a good idea, mining really is tragically unprofitable as things stand and i can't see a downside to veldspar that yielded drastically more, really need stuff like this to give people a reason to venture out of high sec.*endorse*"

12/3/2008,nobody in this game has more or brings more newbies to eve than goonfleet. not even close. just fyi.
12/3/2008,"we also specialize in putting our newbies into what most players would consider 'end game' or 'experienced' roles on day 1. scouting for large fleets, tackling capitals, jump bridging through titans, engaging in 0.0 fights with hundreds of players, learning to survive in 0.0 from day 1 without ever enduring the training wheels that are empire space. we do this with one of the most user friendly wiki's in eve's existance and a corporate structure designed to have every goon helping our cute newbee's love the game as we do and be productive members of goonfleet should they choose to stay. we give them isk, ship fittings, training sessions for tackling/scouting/ratting/sniping/mining/fcing/anything ideas for what to train, and we have numerous channels dedicated specifically to helping newbees."

12/3/2008,"i'd like to add this one to the agenda (assuming tusko agrees since he initiated it): additions to decorationsi'd also like to add the skill queue debate as the popular itemand..aob: promoting csm to the masses, how we can do it better - so it can be discussed in iceland."
12/3/2008,"yes, please push forward the skill queue again. i personally am quite fond of the csm but this should really be a major point. it's prolly the most requested feature out there. ccp more or less ignored it till now and i think the playerbase represented by the csm should keep asking for it until ccp implements it. this is too big a thing to be ignored. the attitude and actions of ccp and the csm on this topic will prolly decide my future in eve (as in staying or leaving the game in the coming 6 to 12 months)."
12/3/2008,skill queue was already raised by csm1 by jade i believe. we will be discussing this in iceland next year as you know.

(and no making it a torpedo ship isn't an option)"
12/4/2008,"i support this being fixed. the biggest problem with the argument here is that there are so many different opinions on how to ""fix"" missiles. missiles were broken in the sense that cruise's could wtfpwn frigs, that was bull and we know it, and because of the speed nerf the numbers on missiles needed to be tweaked, but this has gone to far. there was a reason that the majority of the pvp community warned every new player not to train missiles for pvp and this just made it worse, and thats crap you should be able to blow up ships of equal size with any weapon type as long as you are fitted, skilled, and using them properly. the argument to ""adapt"" by training amarr (said way to much) is also crap, all four races are supposed to be viable in this game, one weapon type shouldn't be the pve type while all the rest are good for both.missiles needed to be fixed from being able to damage all ship sizes that was true, but its to far when you can't get anywhere decent dps on an equal sized ship. supported."

12/4/2008,oh not this again. 2005 wants their topic back.edit: the less than subtle hint is that people have been whining about this for years and yet ccp have the smarts to realise that ****ing off their high-sec player-base without giving them alternatives is a one-way ticket to reduced subscriptions.
12/4/2008,"taxing noob corps is a dumb idea. exploit the system or be exploited. that's the name of the game. honestly, if you're too damn dumb to use game mechanics to work for you, then no amount of in-game fixes is going to fix your problem.and hell, if you can't find a corp that doesn't fall apart when you war dec it you're doing something wrong. maybe you should stop dec'ing one man corps and actually dec corps that have something to lose by disbanding."
12/4/2008,"your assumption that each time this topic comes to the fore (usually once a month), with the same complaint and the same solutions to the said complaint, is a genuine and sincere thread, with no prior knowledge of any of the previous 50 or so threads since 2005 shows that you have a greater faith in mankind than i, that's for sure.a more cynical and suspicious minded person, i.e. me, might think that the continual efforts of a very very vocal and small part of the player base to bring to the attention of the forums an issue, the arguments against which are well known and well founded, and the solutions to which have been repeatedly discredited since 2005, is nothing more than an attempt to get what they want by pure brute force and ignorance.edit: perhaps it's time for a sticky in this forum showing how many times an issue has been raised in the csm forums (and how many times each set of csm's have had to respond to that issue) and if and when that issue was brought to the attention of ccp by the csm.i seriously doubt it will stop certain threads from continually reappearing, as i'm sure they will argue quite forcibly that taxing npc corps 14.5 % is a completely different solution to the problem than taxing them say 14.4%. but if it encourages even one poster to look at previous threads before posting their own solution it might be worth the effort of maintaining."

12/4/2008,the only suggestion i've seen in this thread or the original that i think ccp should actually implement is flagging a pilot who lets outlaws use his maintenance bay. the suicide squad gets concorded; the haulers who do the looting get flagged for stealing. no reason to leave the orca pilot out.
12/4/2008,"discussing is quite meaningless if it doesn't lead to consequences of course. but like i said: remove the insurance for suicide gankers (properly pls, no loopholes like selfdestruct or have yourself shot by alts/mates b4 concord finishes you off and receiving insurance anyway or something like it) and i'll be a happy person."
12/4/2008,agreed

12/4/2008,"not supported as it's not an exploit or anything close to it. it's a clever use of game mechanics and is working as intended. you could do the same thing prior to the orca being released, but you just needed to have ships in safespots."
12/4/2008,"sorry, not supported. i'm no pirate, but i love the fact they are in the game.you nerf insurance on concord deaths, that's fine- what will change? nothing. they'll do it for the kicks, for the laughs, for the whining. it is very easy to make isk in eve, isk loss won't stop it happening.ccp already brought in faster and heavier concord response, and that still isn't enough?"
12/4/2008,this.no other changes necessary.
12/4/2008,i mentioned this in an another thread... or was it this one?can't find it...i'll just say it again.perhaps the gates should lock out pilots that are around -7 to -8 and lower sec status?on top of voiding of insurance.
12/4/2008,"it would be nice if there were practical ways to protect a ship in highsec. maybe a suicide ecm-burst frigate or destroyer, to break the locks of anyone in the area if your mo gets suicided?given that remote repping is far too slow for a concerted, focused attack, maybe a new module that would allow a logistics ship to project a forcefield, like a tiny pos shield-like thing, around a ship that prevents it being targeted and needs to be destroyed (or destroy the projecting logistics ship) before the target can be attacked. prevent a ship so-guarded to do anything offensive, just like a pos shield prevents people targetting out.you could have your logistics ships on standby with friendlies targetted, and if a hostile fleet warps in you can activate these shields. they'd drop the protected ship's locks (and hence would be considered hostile if you're not in the same corp, to save people exploiting it) but means the attackers would first need to take out the logistics ship.this is just rattled off the top of my head so there's quite likely to be serious flaws with it. but maybe the suicide ecm-burst ship would work within existing mechanics. sure, concord would be paying you a visit too but if the attackers get their insurance payouts, why can't you?edit to add: i don't believe suicide attacks should be impossible. i don't believe highsec should be ""safe"", just ""safer"". i don't believe that that safety should be free. make people who are willing to work for it, able to improve their safety. as it stands, 5 hulks and an iteron are at no greater risk than 5 hulks, an iteron, with three bc/bs guards. that's just illogical."
12/4/2008,shield extenders/extender rigs/invuls on a hulk + remote shield reppers (which have a very short cycle time).
12/4/2008,"fitting mining ships for combat (thereby compromising their primary function), simply because of combat ship ineffectiveness in said combat, is hardly a suitable solution. imo."
12/4/2008,"shield extenders are combat modules now? what.i didn't mean put the shield reppers on the hulks. you could always, y'know, have one person sit in a raven or something with a bunch of reppers, if you insist on staying in a stationary blob (an arrangement highly attractive to smartbombers, but whatever). spreading the ships out and having them aligned (even passively) would not only make smartbombers less likely, but would greatly reduce the success of most suicide ganks.or you could just sit in one place, quasi-afk, with no tank or security, and wonder why you keep dying."
12/4/2008,"so basically what you're saying is that this sort of thing would require some effort and planning to do well? 'cus i thought suicide ganking was something that was really easy and had few consequences and the ones it did have didn't matter. isn't that what the whines are about?if you want to kill the pods, use some smarties of your own. probe out the safe (a well skilled pilot can do it in under 30 seconds) and light them up. the fact of the matter is that eve favours the prepared and the one who takes the initiative. the choice to sit in a large, smartbomb-able blob in a belt with a bunch of hulks and itty 5s with no tank and no logistics is yours. you make it knowing that you could be ganked whenever. get out of here with your logic.edit:this. a smartbombing bc costs what, 20-30m for the hull plus maybe 1-3m for the fittis? gank-fit cruisers are easily under 10m. if you think something like that will stop the people who do this from doing it, give your head a shake. in fact, it'll probably get more people doing it just to show everyone that this is not a friendly game where we go on quests to spread love and happiness."
12/4/2008,"this is a really minor request, but it would be great if csm could pick it up with other ui changes like they did last time, so here it is: you can rightclick / bookmark almost any object in space. unfortunately, your own ship is one of the exceptions, so you have to open up people and places, go to the bookmarks tab and use the button there to save your current position. it would be great if there was a ""bookmark my position"" in the right click context menu you are getting when right clicking your ship in space. what this would be good for:- less annoyed pilots (most importantly less annoyed me)- less client and server lag by not unnecessarily navigating through the superlaggy people and places window"
12/4/2008,"i support this...eccm modules are kind of costly on any ship (take a med or low slot), but to make things worst, a single eccm module wont help you much against a falcon (except if you are flying a carrier). you need 2. or 3."

12/4/2008,"you want to fit one eccm and be immune to jamming? it already halves chances of successfull jam. if your bs gets jammed all the time it means falcon pilot is using more then one jammer there, you can't counteract multiple tracking disruptors/dampeners with one module, why should you be able to do it in ecm case?"

12/4/2008,supported
12/4/2008,i'd be more inclined to increase the statistical chances of immunity via skills and not buffing the module.
12/4/2008,"ecm is not broken, nor is eccm, it's the signal strength over range.if you'll notice (bug hunters might want to check this out) an ecm ship up close and personal has a very very low chance of jamming its target, even if it's a falcon. that same ship at max range has a far better chance.i believe this mechanic has to do with the sensor strength falloff over range (if that even exists) which explorers have had to deal with for nearly two years.eccm doubling your base sensor str halves the falcon's chance to jam you with one jammer (remote eccm ii = +120% @ 50+ km!). so he uses two, or three, or even more. ecm does not stack, so he has the exact same chance to block with any of them, and your eccm has the same chance to block each time. it's only a matter of chance before one of the ecm modules does its job."
12/4/2008,"this has been driving me crazy for a while. and it's something every eve user encounters on a daily basis. why is it we can right click linked text and view market details for a particular item, we but have no equivalent for contracts? imagine right clicking a faction module or a link to one and clicking ""view contracts"" next to the ""view market option,"" instead of having to open contracts, retype, search , etc.it would be a great improvement, and a very simple one. most important, it would make spending isk much easier, and overall ui much smoother and more consistent. plus, the amount of programming required would likely be very minimal. what do you think?null"

12/4/2008,"i am planning to raise this topic next week, please discuss, need input."
12/4/2008,"just a few points to consider:1) removing jump bridge functionality may add a little bit of combat but nothing guarantees it will be game changing.2) jump bridge networks allow for more fleet fights across larger areas of space by increasing ship liquidity.3) the ability to anchor jump bridge networks is a huge incentive to hold sovereignty and should probably be compensated for if removed. they create superhighways that keep null-sec empires functioning (pos refueling, rapid response, etc.)4) on the same note, maintaining jump bridge networks is not free - you need to factor in pos fuel, liquid ozone for every jump, and the military challenge of holding sovereignty.removing them is silly, but making them more vulnerable structures would be nice. by increasing the power requirements of jump bridge structures, less military structures can be anchored at the pos. less guns means that attacking a node will be more feasible but still just as meaningful because their functionality was not nerfed.rather than destroy the mechanic entirely, use it to create a new kind of pvp scenario - where hit and run gangs attack jump bridge nodes and responders are sent through the network to deal with them."

12/4/2008,"fahtim, i am aware that jump bridge networks need to be maintained, and alliances are putting a lot of effort into keeping them running. on the other hand, i think that they do break parts of the game in their current form.i am open to any alternative to jump bridge removal, as i consider it to be impossible to get something removed from this game completely. it never happened as far as i can remember. an alternative solution would be for example changing pos mechanics in a way that jump bridges cannot be defended by death stars armed to teeth, a new possibility would open for gangs to camp jump bridges... making them less secure, of course. this, for example, can be achieved by increasing their pg needs. these are exactly the kind of suggestions i need. i could even imagine to separate jump bridges and posses completely. ccp has been talking about more ""anchorable structures"" in the past, maybe changing the bridge to be some standalone thing. this topic is very difficult, i would like to discuss it with ccp face to face, to hear what they think about the lack of regular travel in new eden, but i do not want to do this unprepared."

12/4/2008,"i support the discussion of this, but i'm not at all sure what would be the correct way to solve all of this. i used to play eve a lot way back during release and for a long while afterward so i remember exactly what you are talking about tusko. i've seen bits and pieces of this problem come up in lots of different discussions before, and this all stems into the desire to give relevance back to small gangs, change the way sovereignty works, give the smaller corps and little guys a chance, but of course some sort of balance needs to be maintained because while we want to support the little guy we can't all of sudden shift all the power where the big guys can't function, so removing jump gates and the like could break the game even more.i'm still very new to the ""current eve"" i'm still not well versed in the ways the current 0.0 and pvp works, but i've seen and read enough to know it should be tweaked around. the disruption of logistics should a capable method of warfare between the big boys as well as a way for the little guys to possibly gain a foothold on the big boys if they are smart enough. i can see the opportunity for lots of new pvp encounters that don't just evolve around joining a big alliance and blob fighting or siegeing death stars. i'm not saying this is all bad, but some more variety in 0.0 is needed and i think addressing this correctly could lead to that. sorry for being vague, but i really just don't have enough information to offer concrete detailed solution ideas, only my support for more knowledgeable people to discuss this so i can have more fun in eve again. :)"
12/4/2008,i am not familiar enough with the topic to offer any suggestions. but have been around long enough to hear the vets speak of the earlier days fondly. so a discussion should be made and i guess support of this is also needed.slade
12/4/2008,"ah the good old days when you could make a good living from pvp.will see if i can come up with some suggestions that wont ruin it totaly for alliances at the same time.but god knows it wouldnt hurt to remove jump bridges and for that matter all capital ships(a bit extreme, but i miss the old days and so does most ppl i know that have played or still playes)"
12/4/2008,"as i said above, the goal is to make it possible to interdict logistics without obsoleting anything players have collectively invested trillions in too badly, and without interfering too badly with ""normal"" travel. how to do that is beyond me, though i think my above proposal can at least be used as a skeleton of a solution, but i think that it should at least be looked at."
12/4/2008,"there's a lot to be said about this issue, it is important. before going into more detailed discussion (which i'm very interested to pursue when i'm less tired), one should note that it is virtually impossible to 'resurrect' the 'old days' of eve, even with extensive game-mechanic changes."
12/4/2008,"in my humble opinion, local chat is abused in different ways for different reasons and, realistically speaking, a lot of this could simply be avoided and/or stopped altogether via a modified cspa charge system. i understand that local is currently on the docket for changes and i hope that this could at least be entertained--the idea is like this:empire/low-sec: cspa charge would be some default level. i would recommend something higher than near 3k isk setting for mail, but nothing too substantial that it would prevent an occasional use. the isk could go *poof* into nothingness or it could potentially fuel a fund to act as a prize for a faction warfare raid...basically something of a bank fund for hostiles to knock over (i'd suggest using a collective sum divided evenly among the factions, though, as certain regions are prone to more local chatter than others). either way, a cspa charge would naturally inhibit the scammers in jita local from spamming their wares repeatedly and trying to bait/switch or otherwise deceive the naive as they'd be charged for every post.0.0: cspa charge would be defined by corp/alliance holding sovereignty in system. this charge would have the capability of being filtered so that friendlies can chat away while hostiles would pay absurd fees for banter. this charge could go directly into alliance wallets. this, i think would put a damper on trolls hanging about talking smack (which, generally speaking, involves language and phrases that are rather unnecessary/against ccp policies anyway). basically--if you control the system, you control local.if players want they can still chat for free in constellation (i wouldn't recommend changing constellation to cspa charge except possibly if a corp/alliance has constellation sov...but i doubt anyone would care to change it regardless) and this would not be much of a problem as players can exit this channel if they so desire.anyway...just a thought."
12/4/2008,"not supported...a few points:first, the block button/list exists for a reason... no need to add a cspa charge.two, the problem is still not solved, chatter simply moves from local in one system to constelation chat(or whatever other channel), and i imagine many people would not appreciate seeing chatter/spam from another system, i know i would not like it. and this measure would also hurt legitimate sellers.finally, artificial restrictions like these hurt the open sandbox feeling that many of us appreciate."
12/4/2008,"discouraging communication in an mmo is contradictory.jita is jita, no point in screwing over thousands of locals all over eve because jita's is spammed to death."
12/4/2008,"i think the notion of blocking every individual pilot who happens to be spamming in jita, with local hitting in the 8-900's on routine basis, is less practical than, say, stopping all pilots from spamming. think of it as an access control list--listing every single entity rather than allowing only effective/useful communication through is unnecessary work.you can close any other channel without sacrificing the information local can afford you when it is not minimized/no blinked. this supposed transfer of the problem is actually a huge benefit and not a detriment. whereas local is uniquely useful, constellation (or any other channel) is actually used solely for chat purposes...i don't see how people chatting in a channel used only for chatting is a problem, do you?legitimate sellers aren't usually the ones spamming jita local as ccp has afforded them the ability to create contracts (viewable anywhere in the entire eve universe by anyone who would be interested in them, not just people looking at jita local) as well as sell orders on the market. moreover, i myself would be far more likely to trust someone who posts a wts add in jita local if he's not spamming and is paying a fee to place that ad. if a pilot needs to make a sell so bad he's going to post in jita local, i don't see how a nominal fee is a punishment of any sort.this change would actually make the eve universe much more realistic and even more ""sandboxy."" consider that, while the phrase ""talk is cheap"" is a common idiom in the usa, you'll be hard pressed to find an idiom for bandwidth being cheap in any country. you want to broadcast on rf or on a satellite shot? you're paying money...sometimes big money. you want to advertise during prime time television? you're paying. posting in local is using up bandwidth and creating a sort of static that fills an entire system full of spam/smack and having characters pay for their air time is quite realistic and, as i've already stated, useful.exactly. if you truly consider what i'm suggesting, though, it is not as you considered it at first glance. a cspa for local? yes. discouraging communication? no. my idea could finally make constellation chat a useful entity rather than a novelty chat that most pilots i know close. pilots will still communicate as much as they want in constellation, alliance, corporation, and any number of the other social chat channels available.the distinction is that all the noise/smack/spamming that routinely fills local will be replaced by more effective communication as pilots will choose their messages more carefully to avoid wasting isk. so the end result is: encouraging comms in constellation chat and encourgaing effective comms in local.thank you for your responses."
12/4/2008,no.i understand the issue... but you are failing to see the long term consequences for such an action.this would cause a great deal of harm to overall communication.there are people who are working on this... but not in this context.not supported.
12/4/2008,"you mistake is attempting to read local in jita. as others have said, there is no point screwing up local chat just because you don't like how it is used in one system. just minimize local whenever your there."
12/4/2008,"better idea that doesn't **** over people who currently own these ships.first of all, fighters need to be visited, im going to post my thoughts on this soon.second of all, why change what currently exist when we can create some new ""mobile station ships""?third of all, imho, all super-capitals should be persistent. however....if you log off there could be a 30 minute period of venurability (or something to that effect) and after that it is indestructible. however, this doesn't mean that the hostiles can't camp it from the outside till it logs back in. this is just a thought, but hey, it could be far-fetched as you wanted it to be."
12/4/2008,"i noticed in the original wis video that the characters walked out into the docking bay to look at a zealot. after watching the most recent fanfest videos and reading up on all the information i can about wis, i still haven't seen anything to reconfirm that this is possible.i think if there is anything that will link our characters in the stations to the massive world outside, it should be a sense of scale. if this feature isn't implemented into wis, i think it's going to miss one of the biggest things that eve has been missing. most people i've talked to think that the frigate class ships in eve are the size of an f16, when in truth they are roughly the size of a 747 (from what i've read).there may not be much social interaction possibilites with having access to the hangar, but it would sure get players to appreciate the ships that they have docked up at the time. i think it would also have a much more positive affect on newer player when they realize that their shiney new rookie ship is actually quite large compared to their in-station avatar. it would also be a much more interesting screen to refit/insure your ships from."
12/4/2008,yeah even if i only use the feature once i want to be able to stand in front of my ship in the hangar bay (i also would like an undock animation instead of a black screen but i hear that was shot down long ago)
12/4/2008,i am planning to raise this topic sometime in the future. please discuss.
12/4/2008,"i stand by what i said in august, though of course most of it is just theorycrafting."
12/4/2008,"taking away my signed after re reading and noticing the part about cloaking fuel, theres some crack smoking going on...still in favor of getting rid of local though"
12/4/2008,"cloaking needs to be revisited anyways, we could as well take out that part from this proposal. the very concept of the local change is the main point in this idea, not the cloaking."
12/4/2008,"i think a lot of you are unnecessarily hostile to the op, he has indeed in my opinion pointed out one of my own personal gripes with eve.eve rewards the life long subscriber and not a player. i have run several corporations and have been an active member since 2005, and one of the things that most annoys me about eve is phantom pilots. pilots that aren't actually active but just some created alt that is run on another account and logged into once in a while to change a skill.i hate players like that. considering we are suppose to have a player base in the 100s of thousands you'll be lucky to see 40k+ on over the duration of the day.the current skill system while not flawed is open to abuse. i has a 2005 character cannot unless i subscribe continuiously and an opponent with a 2004 character stops playing, ever catch him up.eve faves age over skill when it comes to the games mechanics. yes i am perfectly aware that a 3 day old character can gank a 3 year old character, but the likelihood of this happening in a 1 on 1 situation is highly likely.the problem really that i see is the following, promoting activity in eve instead of inactivity. the skill system can be adjusted at a later date, i hear ccp are looking into it. but what i really want is to see a system where a player can't have 3 pilots 1 actually being played while 2 are near permenantly offline. it would be nice to see 100,000+ pilots online at one time. perhaps not in jita though xd."
12/4/2008,no way!
12/4/2008,"actually you can catch up, in a specific area. the level 5 of a given skill is a small increment for a considerable time investment, so you can get close quite quickly, and in a given specialisation be equal to that older player. explain to me how the levelling system and grind in other mmos allows you to catch up except by you grinding more than the other person?"
12/4/2008,"terrible idea, eve is different because you don't have to grind for skills..."
12/4/2008,"one of the things i love about eve is the fact in order to get anywhere... you have to work your ass off.oh sure you'll have phantom pilots... but so what... they have to earn there isk... that or beg for it... just to get anything worthwhile.skills can be trained up by anyone.... but you have to buy that equipment.this is far better than say getting on a fps game and getting pwn3d by some 10 year old whose only played for a few days...eve is only limited by the time you put into it.... not by chance.if we start allowing people to earn sp through ""playing the game""... the whole damn landscape changes... now your playing wow.... and lot of people will hate it."
12/4/2008,"i'll support this thread just because i represent the in us all.but seriously, even though it's an arbitrary limit on the development of someone's character development, i guess it's one of the reasons why eve appeals to the people it appeals to, instead of the other (60%?) part of the mmo market"
12/4/2008,"i vote no for the same reasons pointed out above. i left wow because it got boring and i did not have the time to grind to keep up with my friends. if this was implemented i would start getting the same feeling, even if it was just a slight increase in sp accumulation.edit: i am already beind players that started before me, behind players that started with me (do to my inability to always be around when skills finished, forgetfullness), i do not need the feeling that every player that started after me is catching up in sp's when i am not online. not a cool feeling when i do everything in my power to gimp myself as it is slade"
12/4/2008,got a csm delegate thumbs up boosh its all gravy from here on~
12/4/2008,"hello ccp and dear csm team!hey i wanna talk about the wreck and loot thieves in the missions areas like motsu.i now it sounds winy... but i thinked all the last days about it before i started to write this threat...iam doing since some days a lot of lv4 missions, to make a lot of iskies and to buy expensive skillbooks and in one month a carrier...working and fighting hard against the rats ... to make more then one billon isks for ships, skills and inventory...because carrier and stuff are expensive..and now there are people in this missions areas, they are probing with probes the area and try to find other players wrecks, loot and mission places.they steal ca. 50% of the mission reward with there action.... because they salvage all wrecks and they also take the good loot...so i think thats a serios problem, because this people are damaging the game idea...player like me goes to motsu and to do lv4 missions to make money and to buy ships or weapons or skill books with there hard worked money.and the other players are destroying this mechanism. so if i can not make money in the high sec because there are also crime.. for what we have a high sec?hey iam also paying money to ccp to play eve and make missions and not for other people they are using this as exploit.i think this is a realy big exploit and should be fixed.this people should be flashing red, all the days to kill them :) ... and not only if they are stealing stuff, also if they salvaging wrecks!!or make the mission places safe against other player or thieves..i think, that today i lost nearly 50million isks, because this people are salvaging my wrecks and stealing my loot...and i dont wanna think about yesteray or last week...pls dear csm team, you need to do something here...thx for listening and reading,pls think about it.regardslightmans"
12/4/2008,"i have to say that ccp intentionally left salvaging as a non-aggroable offense. i believe that is how it should stay. get a friend or pay someone to save you 25-40% of what you lost, plus the time.also in before someone from tears slade"
12/4/2008,"go out of motsu. no seriously, leave motsu.then, fit tractor beam to loot bs wrecks, than remaining salvage, especially of guristas/serpentis, isnt worth much more.then we got an intresting point. apparently you got issues with people scanning your mission and then salvaging/looting it. i have quite often asked in local, helpmymission, npc corp and other channels if people were intrested in salvaging ae lvl 4. no one ever came. and they didnt had to scan me out.oh and get out of motsu and stop whining."
12/4/2008,"where is your god now (no bears in this post)although i sympathise with the op to an extent, i think the fact you are still in motsu undermines your credibility to an extent. if you'd said vittenyn or scuelazyns or whereever else that's moderately crowded, i would've lent you more support"
12/4/2008,i also sympathize with the op.... imho people have no business frakking around in someone else's mission area.period.but that's not about to change any time sooner.so yeah... leave motsu...there are many fish in the sea.... go find an another spot to fish.
12/4/2008,"i am planning to raise this next week, so please discuss."
12/4/2008,"after i did rest this for a time ... i guess the major obstacle is session change time.minimum warp time (even 1 au) equals session change time (+/- 1 or 2 seconds) so you can jump after exiting warp and don't have to wait for the session timer to expire.if you change this, then small ships will sit on the out gate unable to jump out because of the session timer. this will essentialy reinstate out-gate piracy on fast warping ships (or in very small systems) as they cannot jump out and have to align and get out under fire ...i don't know if that's a benefit or not, but it could be a nasty surprise for some people ;-)"
12/4/2008,"i am okay with session timer forcing small ships sitting on gate together with the ship they are trying to catch. it wont happen too often, only in case of gates closer than about 3 au to each other, but that does not happen all too often. i think session timer is not something ccp can change easily, it must be having some technical limitations too... but even if we were discussing session timers, i would suggest to do it in a separate thread. this one is about the frigs and their acceleration into warp."
12/4/2008,"likewise it takes forever when you're doing exploration to get into and out of warp, much less the fine tuning of dropping a bm at 13.5 au/s.inertial stabs should affect how quickly a ship accellerates and decellerates in warp as well."
12/4/2008,"thats like saying, why do u want to lock your house, if you can't trust your neighborhood then you have bigger issues"
12/4/2008,"many things get into the game in a pre-nerfed state. which is good to the overall health of eve, but leaves some ships and modules underused. in some cases ccp seems like neglecting these things saying it affects only a small percentage of the player base, which is a catch 22 situation. the most blaring example for this is the black ops.i suggest to impose a mandatory revisit time for nerfs and pre-nerfs within ccp should analyze the changes in the use of the item and buff it if it's necessary. the csm could negotiate this limit with the devs. i would be pleased with something betweeen 2 and 4 months."
12/4/2008,could someone please explain to mr. emo here that i didn't say it was ******ed?because i'm unable to communicate on his level.
12/4/2008,"the csm doesn't have to agree, the devs do. and you're right, the devs will largely do whatever they feel is correct. but there are only two options here. one, the csm is utterly useless, in which case you should stop posting here. two, the csm isn't utterly useless, in which case it matters whether we propose a good solution or a bad one. since you seem not to believe the former, you must clearly believe the latter, and thus you ought to care about proposing the right change(even if it's only ""fix but don't remove"" with no further specifics, that at least guides them closer to the right path than what you've said thus far). and if you care about proposing the right change, then flailing about screaming for ccp to do something(tm) is boneheaded and counterproductive. figure out what the right end state is, and provide multiple options if you can't come to a consensus, but don't wreck a bad system in hopes that two wrongs make a right. there is such a thing as a bad ""fix"", and until you realize that, you're not getting my support."
12/4/2008,dude. the name of the character you are posting with renders any ideas you might possibly have utter garbage. and did you post this on a school night?
12/4/2008,"the csm isn't useless but they serve a different role than what face value would lead you to believe. they may appear to be role-playing some kind of player senate, but there is an important difference in that they do not have authority to make laws/changes, they lobby to make laws/changes.during the first csm the council brought up some specific change requests to nerf speedtank, buff assault frigates, i even proposed one myself to make afterburners have advantages over mwd.ccp heard the csm's concerns but their specific proposed solutions were largely wastes of time. indeed all 3 issues i listed above were addressed by ccp in the lastest patch, but none were done so in the way requested.so if i say ""ddds are dddumb, change them in this <random asinine way>"" then nobody can agree on the proposition. and remember, csm cannot dictate changes, they can only make ccp aware of their concerns and make suggestions.the more general the proposition, the greater chances it has to make it to the eyes and ears of ccp."
12/4/2008,"so you admit this whole thing is a waste of our time because you say the csm is unable to do anything.that they only can voice things...so you want them to voice to ccp that doomsday weapons are ******ed.you really that dense or you just here for giggles?because that's all you've given us....no hard facts...no statistics.. no testimonys other than what others have ""graciously"" given in spite of your emo'si think this discussion is over.... as its going no where real quick.tootles."
12/4/2008,"only if you have no goddamn eyes and haven't read a thing i've written.again for the visually impaired, the csm can only bring issues to the attention of ccp and are free to make suggestions, as are we all. csm has no power or authority to impose or dictate any change. they are purely a lobbying committee.you're the only person in this thread that would need any of that. i assume anyone who would argue about it to actually know wtf a titan is.oh god finally, shut the **** up already!"
12/4/2008,"so say ""ddds are dddumb, fix them"", instead of ""ddds are dddumb, remove them"". equally general, and a better proposal overall. at least stick in a rider about how it's important that titans as ships not get nerfed too hard by the change."
12/4/2008,"goal: to introduce an opportunity for hit & run warfare versus logistics without turning sovereignty into capture the flag.proposal:- increase the power requirements of logistics structures (jump bridges, cyno arrays, moon mining) and move all of these major modules outside of the bubble shield.- cyno jammers remain military modules rather than logistical for sovereignty mechanics purposes.- remove the ability to claim sovereignty for any pos using a major logistics structure.- decrease the time to anchor modules significantly.intended effects:as logistics modules take up more power, less guns and modules can be anchored, making a logistics pos more vulnerable. this allows more hit & run gangs to engage the logistical structure, and creates more opportunity for small engagements in 0.0 space.since it is hard to show a presence across an entire 0.0 empire, but significantly easier to show a presence across a jump bridge superhighway, it is not unfair to increase the difficulty of defending logistics structures. this also encourages alliances to build up around their now vulnerable moon mining structures for rapid response, rather than simply claiming random moons across space."
12/4/2008,"reserved..broadened to include to possibility of adjusting other attributes of logistical structures like hit points, signature radius, size/number/types of modules."
12/4/2008,"sounds like a familiar idea, darius johnson was planning a nice proposal for decoupling sovenerity from industry and logistics. he had similar ideas. i liked them very much. supported."
12/4/2008,"i have already raised this topic once, but it was auto-closed. quoting: although lowsec in itself needs a complete revamp, and right now it is not clear which way to go, i think the original op, that low sec sentries are a joke, is still valid and can should be taken care of no matter what. i am planning to raise this issue next week so please discuss. original thread"
12/4/2008,yea because forcing pirates to use even bigger blobs on gates will really improve gameplay?if anything gateguns should be removed as they are mostly counterproductive.
12/4/2008,"not a good idea, as mentioned above gatecampers will only bring more ships remote rep/sensor boost each other. not to mention piracy does not need anymore handicaps.if you want to pull combat off gates, i suggest focusing on ways and incentives to shift more combat off gates and stations. buffing sentry guns solves nothing, except buff blobs."
12/4/2008,"gate guns should smash the snot out of gate blobs, period, no matter how big or how tough the blob is. everything below a bs should pop in a shot or two, and bs should have to worry a good deal about aligning out under fire. keep the current range (150km) to allow for sniping, but the 'in your face' mob should simply not survive.and gates should interdict or energy neut to give cap pilots with their smartbombs something more than a hic to worry about. sentry fire should scale up over time, and focus first on drones (instapop) and fighters (2 shot). currently sentries focus on the capital ship, not its fighters."
12/4/2008,"i'd vote to remove gate guns in lowsec, would have more tech 1 pirates then and more player vs player pew pew rather than huge tech 2 gatecampes."
12/4/2008,meh leave things how they are.
12/4/2008,"agreed, sentries need a serious boost to discourage low-sec gatecamps."
12/4/2008,looks like either you have them and want to keep them or you don't know what they are. you can't seriously think they're adding anything to the game anymore.
12/4/2008,"destroying a tower often means beating the weapons into submission rendering them permanently anchored.unanchoring should not be dependant upon the health of the anchored module, period. especially those that are outside the shield and getting pounded on.any unanchoring module should be based on some pretty steep skills (hacking, et al), take considerable amounts of time, and require a single module (limit hacking modules to one per target) so you won't see pods out there hacking enemy pos guns.attempting to hack a pos system = aggro to the pos & corp = it (or they) can shoot at you freely regardless of security level. and i do mean immediate aggro... otherwise neutrals will just fly around empire unanchoring everything (only modules outside the shield can be hacked. attempting to hack all other modules requires that the tower be offline).if the aggro system is broken for pos (i've had can thieves warp to my pos and sit there untouched) then just make attempting to hack a highsec pos a concord offense."
12/4/2008,"i am planning to raise my agent quality topic sometime in the future, so please, discuss it. please do read my old thread, which was closed, before posting, because there have been quite a lot of discussion about this topic there. original thread (already closed, i <3 you ccp)"
12/4/2008,agleed.how do you feel about .5 and above = same quality as all other .5 and above agents; .4 and below = same quality as all other .4 and below agents but muuuch higher quality than the .5 and higher agents.
12/4/2008,honestly im having trouble seeing where quality factors in at all.there's literally little to no difference even in high sec.
12/4/2008,"agreed i hate the current quality concept it has no use at all i never go to a -1-20 agent because i can do the same missions just as easily with a better quality agent. i would like if quality factored into the difficulty of the mission as well. it would be really cool imo if each agent did a certain amount of missions ( and they wouldn't be random to prevent repeats) and after you did those you would be told to move onto another agent near you and then he would give you some missions and so on. during this you would get storyline missions that actually did something like you just completed your mission you turn it in then you get an eve mail with an urgent request to go save some miners you accept the mission from the eve mail (i hate how i have to go like 6 jumps away just to do one mission) after you accept you only have a certain amount of time to complete the mission, you warp there you see a bunc of pirates and a few allies to help you out and you do the mission that would maybe require you to get to the station and save the civilians inside it."
12/4/2008,"i believe that agent quality is an important attribute in principle, but the way it is applied needs to change. perhaps instead of 'removing' agent quality, we could change or improve agent quality? i have some proposals that haven't been written up yet, will have them ready soon."
12/4/2008,"my idea would be that dmg is increased when you are attacked from behind and on the side. like rl, armor is considerably weaker from behind and moderately weaker on the sides. this would take combat tactics to a whole new level. you could be engaged both sides standing off and then all of sudden another fleet from the enemy warps in on your side and you quickly have to have a few of your ships disengage and keep these other ship from getting to your vulnerable rear. in rl this is a common tactic, not the warping but the flanking is commonly used. this could allow reserves to flank and allow more tactical flexibility and in the right commanders could destroy a force in similar strenght and those that would hide behind their bubbles or jsut send a massive blob of ships at you."
12/4/2008,"i will say that it would be interesting if the damage done to a ship varied by the location that the hit fell on the ship. however, medium to large fleet battles are super laggy as is with all the calculations that occur and this would just pile a whole other load on top of that."
12/4/2008,"i like the idea but using this technique properly would require a much more precise control of your ship, e.g. joystick flight. and also a lot better feedback about where the shots are coming from... as most of us play this game with turrent effects off, but even if they were on, it would be difficult to tell."
12/4/2008,"those are some good points i thing with the large fleet battles ccp is working on that problem right now. and with the needing a joystick i would rather it be based loosely like if they are behind you it's pretty obvious, and with being shot maybe it could pop up on the dmg thing that tells you you were shot from behind, or like some fps games where you will see a small flash from the direction though i would rather it be the first one. maybe to prevent it from playing such a big role make the dmg more minor like 5-10% more dmg if enemy ship is behind you. what do you think?"
12/4/2008,a good proposal wholly unsuited to eve as it exists today. flight control is too slack to allow for proper positioning-based tactics to be viable.
12/4/2008,"coalitions,i'm in favor of it.it makes it easier to know who to shoot at.however i also believe players will always reach to control more then mechanics allow. so even if you reach the coalition point, you'll see multiple coalitions, work together to control vastly larger territories."
12/4/2008,"as an executor of an alliance part of a powerblock, i support changes to help getting standings sorted."
12/4/2008,"making bigger powerblocs should not be encouraged, even though you technically can already do it with the standings system."
12/4/2008,i think discouraging stuff by making it annoying is not the way to go.
12/4/2008,then what are you going to do? give penalties for beeing in a coalition but making it simple to set up?
12/4/2008,"i would like to point out that this thread is not about how to nerf powerblocks. it is aimed for making the administration of standings easier. nerfing and discouraging the formation of powerblocks is a completely different topic and should be discussed separately. i am not very happy about having bigger and bigger powerblocks in game myself, but i have not been thinking about a solution either. it simply not that a huge problem yet. i think this coalition could happen in the same way alliances were added into the game: first, there were only players and corps. than corps decided to form alliances, but the game did not support it yet, so they had huge blue lists set to each other. ccp saw that and implemented alliances. and it was all good. i think the same is happening with alliances now. time for the game to catch up with the society."
12/4/2008,seriously thats just incredibly short-sighted.there is no way you can separate those issues.and yes big powerblocs is already a problem.
12/4/2008,"if you firmly believe what you say then i suggest that you start a thread in features and ideas discussion hash it out with your fellow players and present a proposal to the csm instead of hijacking someone elses thread. just because you firmly believe in something do you really think that gives you a right to derail what someone else firmly believes in, especially when they have demonstrated they have more support for their position than you are able to muster."
12/4/2008,oh no i got busted by the forum police.
12/4/2008,"i often find it amusing that when on these forums if i do something politely i get abused and ridiculed.where as if i had just come out and called you a poor mans troll in love with the sound of their own voice, i would probably have gone up in a lot of peoples opinion.funny old world ain't it."
12/4/2008,"when i first started playing eve, i like most people joined a corp, who then got war dec'd. as i was new and the war mongers werent, i usually had to hide, usually in a station, this is where the problem arises. there is no way to know if the guy in local is outside the station or the other side of the solar system. now if your mr 50 mill sp, i imagine you think ""hehe"", where as if your only 3 months old, and your ship is all youve got in the universe you have to sit there, in station, till the bad guy goes away, or risk everything. bearing in mind we are all paying to play this game, if the bad guy is busy doing a plex ( you don't know that )you can be stuck there a long time, or take the chance, and guess what, he's right there and blows your new ship up. i think stations should have scanners like the ships do, you could either pay to use them, the more you pay the further the range and more details, like, ship type maybe. along similar lines to locator agents. or they could only be accessed if your standings are at a certain level with the station owner or relevant faction. or both together, thus ensuring they arn't just available all the time, leaving plenty of room for station campers to do their thing, especially if you dock at the wrong station in a panic. surely this is just common sense, even the international space station in orbit around our very own planet has windows."
12/4/2008,"or- you could just make a scout alt, like the rest of us knuckleheads who are in this situation."
12/4/2008,"this is missing the recent change in gtc sales to allow an in-game market, and i've not seen any data that indicates trial accounts can't sell them in-game...."
12/4/2008,"wtf is stopping you from placing a bid?as far as i understand it, there are far fewer people selling gtc than there are people buying them, so there is no ""artificially high price"". you pay whatever the sellers ask if you're willing.seller's market, deal with it. i thumbs upping for a completely different reason, as i do not think gtc prices are too high."
12/4/2008,there was this movie i think it was titan ae the movie wasn't very good but they had some cool looking animal like things. i would love to have pets. i would prefer more of a mini pet approach where they don't do anything other than look cool. and it would be really fun to be in deadspace and then see some dolphins or space whales flying by you attracted to all the lights.
12/4/2008,"the day ccp puts animals into space, is the day i stop playing this game."
12/4/2008,"hmmm, ok, but only if your space whales can be hunted by space whalers who could be suicide ganked by the space green peace."
12/4/2008,but goons already exist. i am confused...
12/4/2008,"can't believe nobody has checked out the long running space whales thread, so for your viewing pleasure..."
12/4/2008,nobody ever thinks about the miners. i would support this idea if the whales would spray mercoxit out of thier blowholes. or mine them using an orca.
12/4/2008,"let me begin my rant by summarising carriers current tactical uses.a. repping poses, pos modules, and other shipsb. fighter support is ok in a conventional gang, but suck at everything else.c. logisticswhile the first and the last aspects are, for the most part, fine the way they are, the second aspect leaves a lot to be desired. right now, in a large scale engagement fighters are useless. another thing that annoys the living **** out of me is how bad they suck at killing other fighters (carrier pilots: try this, get 2 of your fighters to shoot at each other. the minmatar ones are invulnerable and the gallente ones are the only ones with enough tracking to even hit a hostile fighter, none the less kill one.)my ideas:i. turn fighters into mean and lean drone killing machines. 1. nerf damage 2. boost tracking enough to at least hit heavy drones 1/2 of the time, and fighters semi-reliably. 3. give them some form of ""auto attack hostile drones"" subroutine or whatever. 4. warp disrupt/scrambling capabilities? (possible just for disabling mwds?)so now carriers suck at killing conventional ships, this could be easily fixed:ii. create a new class of fighters: fighter/bombers (or just bombers even) 1. can effectively engage bc< sized ships with powerful weapon systems that have atrocious tracking. 2. can fire a fairly toned down (but free or extremely cheap) version of the stealth bomber bomb. 3. less hp and slower than a fighter (and a large sig radius to, anything short of sticking a ""venerable target"" sign on it.) 4. bomb capacity?* (can only fire 2-4 bombs before returning to the carrier or mom controlling it) 5. all drones, or at least fighters and fighter/bombers immune to bomber bombs?*also, i would like to remove the ability for capital ships to warp inhibit, and neutralize a target. its stupid, carriers need a support fleet to function in real life, i don't see any reason for them to be solo pwners.here is another idea that might want to be visited:toned down ecm support fighterslimited ewar capabilities, ability to warp disrupt possibly.(imagine something like the raptor from battlestar galactica)anyways, just my take on this whole thing."
12/4/2008,"surely if your fighters are going to have the tracking ability to kill other drones then they are going to be lethal to pretty much every other small ship in the game? sorry, just no. one of the best bits of using a carrier to me is that you have to be very thoughtful about the mix of drones you put in it.. use your fighters to kill the battleships but then have to pull them in and switch to smaller drones to take out the tacklers etc. just being able to launch my fighters safe in the knowledge that they can hit anything you target with them is just not a good idea imv."
12/4/2008,"if i take it right, you suggest that keep the carriers ability to remote rep like now, also keep their logistic agilities, but for their combat role, give them fighters that can warp scramble, or even shut down mwds, other fighters, that can track down even smaller drones than themselves, and bombers that inflict massive aoe damage? this would turn carriers into superbrutal solo pwnmobiles! we surely do not want that to happen."
12/4/2008,"seeing this statement by bunyip:and this following post:and his idea on his website:i feel he is lacking data on the question and underestimating the secondary effects, so he raising the question on his terms can be negative.in particular what bother me is his idea that:1) raising npc bounties and removing the t1 loot is a good thing. both moves are in the direction of increasing inflation, something that in my eyes is not a positive.2) a increase of 10% in bounties will compensate for the removal of the minerals from the t1 loot. in my small mission result database minerals from reprocessed loot is 20% of the total rewards, while bounties are the 15% of the total rewards (nb: i always loot). increasing the bounties by 10% mean making them the 16,5% of the current rewards while removing the 20% of the current rewards. 1,5% against 20% seem a laughable compensation. at the same time it is a reward for the people that power run the missions only for the lp and monetary rewards, with a small increase of the payout for them at no cost. [continue]"
12/4/2008,"[2nd part]then there is the matter of the effect on miners that bunyip think will be positive. sure, mineral demand will increase, but i doubt that total mineral prices will change, the insurance mineral basket will still keep the total price in the same region. the most probable effect will be a further rise in the low end and a further drop in the high end. so while a change in the t1 drops can be needed, a instant removal as proposed by bunyip don't appear the right solution.so please comment and give your opinion, possibly articulated arguments pro or against the loot removal so that a better documented proposal can be presented to the csm. in particular comments from some of the market guru can be very useful."
12/4/2008,"this was the subject that i really wanted to post on. the others came on the heels of first but the wardecs really need an overhaul. i also agree that it's not a quick fix and that many ideas will have to be considered and refined. the fact that ccp is looking at a way to change it is good to know. i'm willing to throw ideas at them, although i'm not sure where to put them. either way, at least it stands a chance of being changed in the future. good enough for me.absolutely. i understand that this is a business venture and that when it's all said and done that ccp is running a business that must make money and be profitable. also, the eve skill system is still the best offered by any mmo out there. however, given the fact that so many players want some sort of queue you would think that they would be willing to look into it. i don't believe that players should be allowed to have skills progress on an expired account. but if the account is currently being paid for then what is the issue? even if the queue was only allowed to have 23 hours of skills queued up, knocking out 23 hours worth of 15 minute skills would be a bonus. but if that is firmly in the realm of ""non-negotiable"" then all i have to say is ""bah, humbug.""i find your analysis refreshing and would be an excellent update in the future.you can't always kill drones... however i drop this argument completely to save space for more important topics.you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. encourage all you like but if an alliance gets several hundred of it's members online and into a fleet they are not going to break it up into smaller fleets so they can engage in waves. utopia often longed for but never achieved. hoping that players will tailor their tactics to timid trips of tens is like... hoping for a button that will put all the high slots offline at once. other than that, i agreed with, and liked the rest of your ideas.the fact that someone listened and then commented is more than enough for me. it's all that anyone in a forum can ask for. my thanks for your time and your efforts."
12/4/2008,"an eye for an eye makes the whole world blindi can't believe u suggested this, as an official means of retaliation.vengeance is not enough as even limited retaliation continues a potentially endless cycle of violence. mahatma gandhi remarked: ""an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind."""
12/4/2008,i would like to point out that the roles of alternates was not really discussed. was this issue cut?
12/4/2008,"it was discussed in part in the meeting section, but yes, it was essentially cut from the agenda"
12/4/2008,funny as you think this is. it seriously isnt and i feel it will ruin the csm. darius i remind you of your past dealing with a certain powerheaded member of the csm. have you taken over for constatine? goons business is business and frankly never really thought ill of them. but to war dec to cause a vote in your favor. i feel its bad form and should have you removed and any other goon on the csm. joking or not!
12/4/2008,totally agree. war dec is fine as it is. ok maybe cost more but sec hit? please. just call it hello kitty in space then. i mean im not a pvp god like others but wow that was just idiotic.
12/4/2008,"i stand corrected on the value of lowsec mining, but i fail to see how another logistics nerf would be required if minerals were availible in 0.0. it's already really god damned hard to build anything bigger than a cruiser in 0.0 as it is, making minerals bigger or fiddling with how the ore is stored will just nullify the changes made. why would you go through all the effort to make mining low-ends in 0.0 easier just to make doing anything with the ore you recovered that much more difficult?short of a jump freighter, it's almost impossible to move minerals in the quantities required to build bss in 0.0 currently, why in the name of god would you want it made even more difficult? ccp has stated that they want 0.0 to be more friendly to smaller corps and newer players, and making it still require a stupidly expensive ship and a highly skilled alt to move the materials your newbies mined is pretty much completely counter to the entire thrust of these changes."
12/4/2008,"hello all,i had an idea similar to this called ore distribution on my webpage. i plan on pushing it in a future csm meeting, but for now, a few other issues take priority. you can view the idea by clicking on my signature on the bottom.if somebody wants to raise this issue for me (if you deem it has merit), i would be honored. my biggest concern right now is meta 0 rat droppings, followed by exploration belts, etc."
12/4/2008,"if this super-ore was put into 0.0, you wouldn't need to haul minerals in. i was under the impression that you wanted to essentially replace mineral logistics with local mining, not just augment it. the reason that a logistical nerf would be needed is because you're talking about giving them something like 40m/hour worth of lowends from mining in 0.0 and there's no guarantee it'll be used locally. i suppose you're right though and honestly, exporting minerals might not be a bad thing. i just don't think that making as much isk from veldspar in 0.0 as crokite makes sense. i agree that it should be more financially feasible to mine the lowend minerals locally but that doesn't mean it should be as profitable as arkanor etc.i am of the opinion that almost all ore should be available in all sec levels but that its quality should vary dramatically across the sec level range. so you'd have ****ty jaspet and hemorphite in highsec and better than normal veldspar in lowsec, for example. that way the ore in lower sec levels would be inherently better than that in higher levels rather than being different. this could be most simply implemented as a kind of illegal blast-mining that you can use in lowsec/0.0 to increase the concentration of ore in asteroids based on sec level. so you'd blast the veldspar in a 0.1 system and it'd blow apart the rock and leave only the more concentrated 200% yield ore and in 0.0, veldspar could get a 300-400% increase when blasted. the lowsec-only ores like jaspet and hemorphite wouldn't be blastable but there would be a 0.0 equivalent that works on those too.not to be picky or anything but that ore distribution idea is almost identical to the one i posted in 2007."
12/4/2008,"i can believe that, but i hear you guys have some pretty stringent new recruit policies. probably just rumor-mongering, but that's what i've heard."
12/4/2008,you have to own a forum account from somethingawful.com for at least 3 months and be a relatively active poster. it requires some planning for someone just looking into it but it's not asking too much for the rewards you get in return. we generally recruit straight from that sites userbase and don't ask people to go make accounts first.
12/4/2008,"i, as a newbie, find 3 months a long time to just wade through the loads of information this game has. i know a lot of people prefer a hand-in-hand approach to new types of games (i wouldn't consider eve your run-of-the-mill mmorpg). i agreed with many of the old posters that there are tons of guides out there for the newbies, which could also be the problem.the newbies see all this information put in front of them and they don't know where to start or even if they want to start. it's like coming into rl with no parents and only knowing how to read. the library is your friend but there are a lot of books... the books aren't all small either, i pull up the eve-online compendium... 801 pages, not a lunch-break read. that reminds me of the user manuals no one (sorry most people) never read all the way through. even eve's player guide is not a short read. i spend half of my free time dedicated to eve reading and the other half actually doing things in eve (though time-based skill learning helps me do things while i read). granted i like reading and the challenge of this game but, not everyone likes to be presented to that when they first step into the game.the tutorial gets you somewhere but, after that you are on your own with no real direction (part of the freedom which we all love). i think it could be better setup with a weeks to a months worth of general guidance (depending on your race, school, and specialization) for new players to follow or not follow if they would prefer to go their own way. the new boxes that will be shipping should at least have a manual for new players to have on hand while they play (i tend to go through it until i can get to my computer and play the game).anyway to make a long story short, imho 3 months is too long to go without help for most new players (especially if they come from some virtual world filled with weird things like elves and fairy-like creatures). i think that a better system needs to be in place that doesn't tie up volunteers and makes it a fun learning experience (even if it has to be a long one). currently it seems like volunteers can easily get worn down by new players not understanding things or asking the same questions over and over (i'm a supervisor at a retail store, i know what it is like). i think ccp needs to invest the programming time, which would put less stress on their volunteers. this would keep them engaged and motivated so new players feel welcome and not like a burden to old players.p.s.  i would have voted for issler, if i would have voted (i knew about the csm before i started playing i just didnt have time to research the candidates). this is because she seems to care about everyones playing experience, including newbies and she tends to support more casual players which is my play style."

12/5/2008,"woah, you want to nerf piracy more despite the fact that there are many risks and consequences for going down that path. there are many ways to avoid getting ganked, of course many of them require thinking--which is what most of us pvpers and pirates do, yet we get nerfed for our ingenuity? something is wrong with this picture....i have missioned, mined, traded, and manufactured in the past and have never ever gotten ganked.. not because of luck, but i took the time to understand the mechanics and determine the safest and most efficient ways to do them. thinking is the best defense/offense that a play has in this game regardless of the player's profession. vigilance is the player's second best defence/offence.i will summarize my arguement by pointing out that incompetence on the part of the individual player is not a acceptable justification for nerfing an already challenging playstyle.i walked a mile your shoes (as a miner/mission runner/industrialist) i suggest you walk a mile in mine..."
12/5/2008,"care to explain what could be doing the ""enough protection"" to protect you in high sec space?kill everyone that enter the system? shoot the smartbombing ships while they warp in through some magic of them? remote repping the mining ships hoping they are fast enough and skilled enough to save them? care to define the numbers of ""enough protection"" against the numbers of miners and how you think to compensate them while earning 10 millions hour per miner?if you feel the risk is low as long as the number of suicide gankers is low, fine, say that. if you feel that suicide ganking is fine, again, it is your right to say that.but try to be honest and don't say that it is possible to protect efficiently miners in high sec. in high sec you can react only when the attack has started (barring wars) and at that point the mining ship is already doomed."
12/5/2008,this. if players are willing to invest enough isk to get this whole chain running then they should be able to. the op is really sounding as if wanting to make hisec 100% safe not the game most of us signed up for i believe.
12/5/2008,"false statement or ignorance.1. insurance is voided if the ship is in the hands of another player when the ship is destroyed. if the person that insured it get it back and it has never been repackaged in the meantime, the insurance is still valid.2. ok, the alt paid the ship, them main insured it and get the money. so he still get the isk on one of his characters. so if the suicide ganking character is already at -10 and the ship is insured he will get out of the ganking attempt with almost 0 cost and practically 0 consequences.if they will pay for the laughs, fine, but they are getting them for free."
12/5/2008,"concord use ecm very well, but gankers use smartbombs, as they need to kill fast, without locking targets. yes, suicide ganking should be allowed, but while hi-sec should be safer and not safe, suicide ganking should be doable, not 0 cost even if you get nothing.the whole issue is that currently it is possible to suicide gank at 0 isk cost and with this tactic at 0 sec status cost, removing any consequence."
12/5/2008,"1 medium shield extender and 1 resits. wow tons of hit points. rigs on a ship you need to move from system to system often. another smart move (but the orca here will help). and you are still increasing a low shield value.remote repping in advance. so what is your idea of a mining op? 2 hulks, 1 basilisk, 1 hauler?the return is still 10 millions/hour for each hulk. again where you get the isk for the protection pilots?"
12/5/2008,"mining ships are like wet tissue paper, that said i don't think any playing style should be nerfed out of existence, even though that has what has happened in the past. i like variety in gameplay. as long as any group is not too inconvenienced, why change a playstyle. first i think concord is too uber buff. they shouldn't always be able to pawn everything. and currently the high sec suicide gankers with -10 sec status aren't so widespread that they cannot be avoided. kinda like cloaked ships were used to avoid concord in the past. i think that should still exist to an extent, like basically you could maybe sneak into high sec for small period of time and in that time there is a chance you will be detected. currently concord is this omnipresent, all knowing, all powerful force guarding high sec and i don't think it should be that way. concord should be powerful, yes, but it should exist as individual ships with patrol routes that have to rely on intel to respond to a crime. and residents of a system should have to pay money like in taxes(sales, mining, mission) in order for concord to exist and vote on tax rates or elect representatives to run a system. the representative(major, etc.) can then decide how to tax the system and how to use the funds to buy and repair concord ships, gateguns, and creating laws, and other functions. there should be max tax rates of course. this can effectively create dynamic security systems. basically this will allow people to effect geography of space itself. if a local pirate gang wants to convert a high sec system to low sec all they need to do is destroy all the concord spawns in the system. this may take a few days for the higher sec systems(1.0) and can be further increased in difficulty by concord replacing itself due to taxes. this would result in pirates having other options. on the mining/mission running side, they can convert a low sec region to a high sec region by actively mining and mission running and engaging in market transactions. you can also temporarily have low sec ores in a high sec region due to this. if the balance is done correctly you would see an equal number of low sec regions appearing as you see high sec regions appearing."
12/5/2008,fixed it :)
12/5/2008,"alright, this method of suicide ganking is old.if you guys do some tests, you will notice that there is only 1 tiny fix which is necessary, which wouldn't require much efforts:give the police frigate warp scrambling abilities with a warp strength of 9. this would prevent pirates from boarding ships at a safespot and then being able to warp to a belt.for those who have followed ""yarr"" lessons, you should know that police spawns wherever you go. only issue is that the police frigate locks first and webs, a thing which in fact makes you warp faster (the other ships in the police spawn take significantly more time to lock you, therefore cruisers can escape without being scrambled). so it is currently possible for a cruiser to escape the police for quite a while in high sec space.this simple idea would fix the issue in 10 seconds instead of waiting 6 months for ccp to come up with a better idea.well, on the other hand you can simply wait for the long solution with insurance, but still, losing a cruiser means nothing (i mean a caracal is like what... 3 or 4 million isk? it's laughable)."
12/5/2008,"8 pirates left eve cause of the concord buff? if that's the case they aren't worthy of the name. supported, remove insurance for suicide gankers and leave the rest alone, that should make suicide ganking a viable playstyle."
12/5/2008,someone mentioned that suicide gankers sometimes use smartbombs to get around the ecm jam.part of the concord buff was neuting to take away that very part of it.
12/5/2008,"i support the reduction of insurance for people killed by concord, but only by 50%. other than that though, this idea stinks of whine and laziness. if you're not afk you will see who attacked you, and since they are all -10 in pods, you only need a prober and a single ship with a few smartbombs to get revenge and clear them out of the system for a bit. oh wait, what's that? you can use their own tactics against them? impossible, clearly the only solution is to give up and cry on the forums.seriously, here is a comparison of the effort each side has to go to:miners:- get mining ships- warp to belt- go semi-afkpirates:- get orca- insure and fit ships- load orca with combat ships- get several willing pilots including someone who can fly an orca- scout for good targets- set up a safespot with the orca- get a warp-in point- avoid attracting the attention of locals- coordinate the boarding of ships- coordinate warping in to attack- kill as many targets as possible- get someone else to scoop loot- sell the loottotal active time for each:miners: maybe 20% of the time for as long as they feel likepirates: a day or two to organise a large group of players and arrange a time, a few hours to set up the ganknow, who do you think really deserves to win in a situation like this? even with concord protection there is no way you can argue that the miners should be able to survive a coordinated attack like that."

12/5/2008,"supported - ewar is currently broken, one of the ways to fix it is to provide working countermeasures."
12/5/2008,"thats just wrong. a falcon can perma-jam ships between 10-14 sensor strength (depends on range, skills, rigs etc.) a eccm dominix has a strength about 44 points. 44 points without overloading and additional backup/eccm modules. just let's do some math (again). preconditions: - 5 x racial jammer , two gallente and 3 ""wrong"" jammers.- jam strength of ""right"" jammer ~ 12.5- jam strenght of ""wrong"" jammer ~ 4probability of miss a jam cycle with a ""right"" jammer : p1 = 1-12/44 probability of miss a jam cycle with a ""wrong"" jammer : p2 = 1-4/44probability of jam a eccm dominix : 1-(p1^2*p2^3) = 61%you can of course do some variations like adding 1-2 jammer, or using only gallente jammers but such synthetic tests are not representing real combat fittings for a falcon. even having two of ""right"" jammersisn't very likely.let's say it again: a good skilled falcon/rook has a chance to to jam a eccm-dominix of over 60% when using all its jammers on 1 ship. thats far from perma-jam capability.perma-jam capability: yes. if a falcon posses 1-2 ""right"" jammer, it can perma-jam 1-2 non-eccm cruiser/frigates."
12/5/2008,"well falcon have 100% chance to jam hac with right jammer, how it is chance based i ask you"
12/5/2008,"yes it has a 100% probability of jamming a non-eccm hacs with full rack of sig amps/rigs.eccm modules are not that popular in hac fittings. why is this so ? i think most hac pilots consider real dmg more dangerous than ecm. i call it free choice.if anybody fits his ship to tank real damage, he usually uses 3-5 slots to create a viable tank. 3-5 slots, thats a lot. even ships with natural resistances do fit some kind of tank or buffer. skipping even most rudimentary tank leads to a disaster under enemy fire.same kind of disaster happens when a ecm-untanked hac meets a falcon.some people think, fitting 1 eccm module should be enough to counter ecm. why not fit 3-4 or more modules ?thats simple, because pilots decide to fit armor or shield tanks and no real ecm-tanks.don't tell me ""i'm missing additional med slots for eccm"". use low slots if you desperate need eccm. ""my low slots already filled with hardeners"". it's your choice.look at ships with natural ecm resistances, recon ships. they rock against falcons but totally suck in tanking real dmg. now look again at recons. you can ""tank"" them, but they'll never shine as tank monsters. same for ships with no ecm resistances. you can ecm-harden a dmg dealing ship, but it will never shine in this role. maybe with exception of battleships, you can pretty well ecm-harden battleships.""i fitted a reactive plating on my maller and this rupture still doing huge dmg to my ship. ccp boost platings!!"""

12/5/2008,didn't notice this when i did my search last nightsee also my suggestion
12/5/2008,an excellent idea. however some of us still won't get onto many kills because our targets tend to live.
12/5/2008,"it'd actually be better for you to not have remote reppers on killmails, since killmail records can inform the enemy of which names to watch out for, and the information there can be used to determine enemy tactics (e.g. you might be using remote-repping ships in a fleet fight without the enemy realizing it; recording this on killmails would give away your tactics).i really don't give a ****."
12/5/2008,"it's epeen versus intel control - op clearly comes down on the pro-epeen side. i don't care much, but given that the current killmail system doesn't care much about controlling intel, it seems like a waste of time to start now."

12/5/2008,this is for all the people who have done something to loose their security status. create a skill and system whereby you can increase your chances of a successful bribe.skill : bribery (pre req = connections 5)5% increase chance of successful bribe per levelskill : bribery cost reduction (pre req = connections 5)5% reduction in bribe cost per level.bribe costsi don't know what a price for this should be that would make this option a last resort. maybe 100 mil per full 1.0 security status gain.successful bribesbribing would be done only at concord stations. bribing price would vary depending on how much sec status you are wishing to gain.if you are between -5.0 and -10.0 the cost of the bribe would increase by 10.if you are between -4.9 and -2.0 the cost of the bribe would increase by 5.if you are between -1.9 and 5.0 there is no increase in payment.un-successful bribesif your bribe is unsuccessful you will be fined a rate of 200% the price of your attempted bribe and your sec status would be decreased by 2 percent. if the security status was between -10.0 and -5.0 then a further fine of 100% will be issued.you will not be allowed to undock until the fine is paid.you will be allowed to remotely sell assets to pay your fine.
12/5/2008,good idea i would like to add to it a little. i think the 200% is a little extreme i would be happy with the bribe not working and you have to wait a certain amount of time to atempt the bribe again ie. your bribe has failed we will keep the sum you have givin us as a gift. you will have to wait 3 hours to make another attmept. i think they should be smugler agents and only available in low sec and null sec. low sec has them spaced out pretty well and null sec as a good amount. one last thing i think it should be pretty expensive too.
12/5/2008,interesting idea
12/5/2008,"liking this. not sure how it will affect balance though, needs some careful consideration on cooldowns and perhaps diminishing returns."
12/5/2008,one of the biggest reasons i don't yarr is cause i have no interest in grinding sec status. great idea.
12/5/2008,"awesome, a concord agent could handle the bribes with diminishing percentage of successfull bribe per attempt - this should also go into criminal record if such a thing would ever be implemented."
12/5/2008,"would be a very interesting way of going about things.i support an idea like that, but cool off periods for unsuccessful bribes would be needed.do not implement the no undock feature, or fine for unsuccessful bribes thou. just make it if they were unsuccessful then they have to wait a certain period of time before they can try to bribe again.also supported as a isk sink method ;-p"
12/5/2008,"we had this back in the day with concord. it was an easy rinse and repeat for gankers not wanting to own up to their crimes and it was taken out. i don't want to see it back in, unless there's a risk of you bribing the wrong guy, undocking to find yourself wasted by concord or having the ss dropped like a stone to -10."
12/5/2008,"i first read this subject and thought, ""no way!""but the idea of having bribes and hopefully more skills to develop a real 'smuggler's' profession would be great.add a few more restrictions and possible some 'real' negative outcomes if the bribe fails would definately add to the gaming enviroment."
12/5/2008,"this would be the main reason to not support this. if something could be implemented to make bribes less succesful if done too often, even with level 5 trained, then it may be workable. otherwise why have concord and sec status. just let people do what they want and then pay the fines.slade"
12/5/2008,this is similar to what oblivion does. you commit a crime and you get put in jail where you can either pay the fine or break out and become kos.sec status really is an old-timer's mmo concept (faction ftl) in that its a terrible terrible grind.
12/5/2008,"no...not supported.... self defeating and defeats the purpose of concord/sec status.personally i feel sec-status is not ""strong"" enough for today's usual antics."

12/5/2008,"hmmm, that would be ok if it was a ""one off"" mission but i had a ""storyline mission"" the last of which (4 of4) was sent to 0.4 space.i disagree, i think the missions need reviewed.i believe it's 4 hours or so until i can approach the same agent again, who might give me another nission to lo sec?thanks v much for the reply tho."
12/5/2008,find an agent located 4j+ away from closest lowsec sector
12/5/2008,"this is one of the ideas i agree with, and i've written an alternative on my webpage. supported!"
12/5/2008,"so you want low sec to be completely safe like high sec?if not, then were do you expect the fights to happen?cause right now:- hardly anyone mines in low sec, unless they have the system completely secured, cause high sec mining can get you almost as much isk without the risks.- hardly anyone rats in low sec, as any lvl 3 mission will get you more isk.- hardly anyone missions in low sec unless they have backup in system or good intel network.everyone else goes from gate to gate, or gate to station which both have guns near them.do you really want to kill all pvp in low sec?right now fighting under gate gun fire is a big disadvantage, if you make it impossible then low sec will be completely deserted (as if it isn't yet)."
12/5/2008,"zibu, sorry to disagree, but what i see in lowsec are solo ships (hactors, battleships) solo tanking sentry fire and killing trespassing haulers and smartbombing passing by frigs and shuttles. i have no idea why you think that fighting under sentry fire would be such a huge disadvantage. it is a huge disadvantage if you are flying a crow. i welcoming low sec change ideas, as something needs to be done. right now there are 2 different ways people are proposing for low sec; one is making it more secure, so practically moving it closer to hisec, so that more people go there so that you can shoot more stuff (if you are good), or you make it more like nullsec, give more control to local pirate parties, like the viceroy system people were hinting about... but even if local pirates were ""boosted"", i think sentry firepower should be boosted because first, it is a joke right now, second, i do not believe that low sec ""pirating"" is supposed to happen at the gates, with people camping gates all the time."
12/5/2008,isn't making low security space more secure somewhat of an oxymoron?and its hard enough to be a criminal as is. give lowlife's a break for once.
12/5/2008,"i support the discussion on this topic, but i don't think that increasing the dps of the guns is the right solution."
12/5/2008,"no.combat only really happens on the gates these days, making the guns tougher will eliminate any form of solo-pvp and small-gang combat on the gates themselves. just enforcing the gate-camps to become bigger with more rr.it's already pretty tricky for me to engage on a gate in my ishkur and get a kill, usually i just have to completely avoid it.low-security sentries are fine, granted large blobs are a bit of a problem. but giving bombs for stealth bombers a bit of a buff could help towards this maybe."
12/5/2008,"i could only be in favor of buffing the guns if they were made destroyable. it makes no sense that the guns just sit there, happily shooting, and outlaws just let that happen."
12/5/2008,"irida, the plain fact that you can engage someone on a gate using an ishkur is already a clear sign that low sec sentries need a boost!"
12/5/2008,"which would cause more blobing and larger more organized camps on the gates. solo/small camps are easy to bust/evade afterall. i would know because i broke up camps as a merc... i will once again point out that pvp in low sec occurs in 4 places. -gates-belts-stations-missions/safespotsof those 4 areas, people hardly mission or go to belts in low sec due to the poor risk/reward balance so finding fights or targets there are very rare.that leaves just gates and stations, which you are proposing to have nerfed. this once again sounds remarkably like one of those poor arguements to make low sec more like highsec. instead of pushing to have gates nerfed why not look at other areas such as risk/reward or promoting other measures that would pull fights off gates/stations. placing more artificial restrictions only degrades the sandbox environment we all enjoy."
12/5/2008,"how long does the ishkur last, out of interest?"
12/5/2008,"the lack of a skill que does not equal increased play-time. all the lack of a skill que (regardless of its size/functionality) does is annoy the player base (me!).having a skill que (especially if its limited to one skill - or one level - or whatever) will not equate to fewer people playing! the only thing that limits my play time is rl...oh, yeah, and the wife! wife > skill que #1 - queing will not promote ""churning"" of characters for re-sale... since the ghost training nerf (the supposed ""bug"" that was found after 5 years.... and a change of the player manual...) if someone is going to ""churn"" charecters, they will do it regardless of a que... especially as ccp has made the selling of toons legal... vov i'm just sayin...#2 - rl > eve. rl dictates for me (& for the vast majority of players) how much time they get to put into internet spaceships... so rl will have a far greater impact on play time than any que...its late, and i'm very tired, and the ridiculous (read lame) answers from ccp on this issue demand more explenation!supporting haveing ccp tell us whats really on their minds...akedit: spelling, again...."
12/5/2008,happy players are more interested in playing the game and if skill management often gets regarded as a chore then this will make people more inclined to give up. if you want people to play the game then positive motivation goes a lot further than denying something that would make many happy.
12/5/2008,"already signed all the other skill queue threads. thinking that no skill queue will encourage people to play more doesnt make any sense. the only thing happening is that the goals i set for myself get such a rediculous delay with all the deviations i need to set for myself just not to lose research time... already asked the it guys at work if i could install eve just to be able to change my skills when i needed to (not when i was forced to for not having a skill queue), but the obvious answer was no :pso do everybody a favor and implement a 1 slot skill queue and it would make the eve experience a lot easier..."
12/5/2008,"i think ccp might be mistaking ""leaving client running in the background so i don't have to log in when i need to switch skills again"" with ""playing""...."
12/5/2008,"csm has already brought up the idea of destructible outposts and ccp said that it was technically impossible. we did not discuss the destruction of smuggler gates yet but as long as there is no way to build those gates, i would be strongly against blowing them u. i am sure a lot of alliances would blow them up for tactical reasons, and it would cripple 0.0 pretty much."
12/5/2008,"no it wouldn't, those gates were added late to facilitate fleet fights when there were hardly any people around, connecting deep space of one region with deep space of another. now that's no longer the case and there is no deep space thanks to these gates. they effectively shrunk eve beyond the point of where it would have to be, eve feels small now and it's largely due to these easy access back doors.as for conquerable stations and outposts, those are two different things, you need nothing to run a conquerable station as far as i know, tell me if that changed through time but you need a hell of a lot to maintain an outpost. blowing the css would make everyone suffer equally and the hard work of those maintaining outposts all the more appretiated by their peers, as there no longer is an easy option."

12/5/2008,"static values on anything is bad and when given out as readily as with agents very bad. who is it using those ****ty agents anyways, anyone, ever???"
12/5/2008,"heh. the wardec had nothing to do with votes. votes were the silly reasoning stated by the decced in this thread, not me. i merely played along because it made me laugh. this is a game. you'd do well to remember that. you need to relax."
12/5/2008,you are aware delve is one of the most empty regions in the games right?
12/5/2008,i understand its a game. however you as a person player represent me on the csm. so you have real life contact with those i dont that control the game i pay to play just as you do. youd do well to rember that! and i do take the fact i voted for you. and expect you to conduct yourself as my rep as such. verry serious. as a goon in game i dont take you serious.
12/5/2008,"i looked at what you wrote way back in 2007, and most of the mineral changes i can get behind, it's pretty much a fleshed out version of what i wanted. the 'basket of minerals' and plat insurance as price limiters is a very salient point to make about how the mineral market as a whole runs. and the 'basket effect' can be seen right now, as the huge sums of trit for capital ship production are increasing the cost of trit and forcing a slump in the cost of mid and high ends in addition to general inflation of ship prices.some of your assumptions don't make much sense, given my personal experience with deep 0.0 logistics and mining. the 0.0 regions would export low-ends and screw up the market.1) the logistics boats are run on a cost per cubic meter per jump basis. it costs you x amount of fuel per jump, with y jumps to get to the target system. for myself, it was about 30 million isk round trip from our home region to lowsec and back in a carrier. my carrier, completely cargo expanded, could hold about 25k m^3. this means ever cubic meter of crap i carry costs me 1,200 isk. this flat rate fee means the item must either have a much higher buying price in empire, or it needs to be so value dense that the fee is a small portion of the total cost. here is a valid comparison.a cubic meter of megacyte costs about 265k right now. adding the extra 1200 isk fee means almost nothing, less than 1%, which you lose on broker fees anyway. thus if empire is 10% higher than local markets for megacyte, it makes sense to export it to highsec and sell.a cubic meter of tritanium on the other hand, only costs 400 isk per cubic meter. that 1200 isk transportation fee suddenly adds a great deal of cost to the load.using the best compression items brings the value density of trit up above megacyte, allowing for the importation of lowends at a reasonable cost. it still adds both time and complexity to the industrial task of building a bs, but it remains feasible.2) (1b really) in order to compress the low-ends into items for transport, it requires a great deal of factory slots. this slots come at a steep premium in 0.0 space, and would be subject to '3 stooges syndrome' if anyone tried to export lowends in bulk. 3) local demand out strips supply considerably. given the amount of destruction caused in any real 0.0 war, bs losses on the order of 20+ per day can be seen quite often. that's a impressive sum of trit, which makes exporting it for profit takes both time, effort, precious build slots, and depletes the local supply kinda dumb. from personal experience, exporting for profit only happens when a substantial sub of isk can be made in the process.if miners can locally produce everything needed to build a bs and not take a huge profit hit doing so, most people will happily mine away at whatever they feel has the most value, bit it personal profit, or corp level industrial projects. i know i would personally take my hulk out and mine up enough minerals to produce a batch of cruisers and frigates for the new players in my group. it's a hell of a lot easier to take the profit hit than it is to go all the way from southern esoteria to lowsec, compress a bunch of minerals, cart them back home, and refine them than it is to just haul it back to the station and pres butan."
12/5/2008,"well that's really only one assumption but you're quite correct that it's not proven. however, i've lived in a little corner of 0.0 before where the hauler spawns dropped 45-90m of trit a time and the demand for trit there was not outstripped by the supply. we actually did have people exporting it through mineral compression. so that assumption was based on personal experience even if that experience proves to be the minority in 0.0 (which i'm well aware that it is). i'm willing to concede that tritanium and pyerite are currently not easy enough to export to be significantly worth it. but are you specifically suggesting we only only super tritanium or don't you want high quality kernite, isogen etc? at what point would the other minerals be feasible to export?when i lived in 0.0, i had the most irritating experience. i wanted to mine the ore to build things but losing out on 20-30m/hour by mining veldspar just made it completely infeasible. it's currently not feasible to mine minerals locally and while making as much isk/hour from every ore in 0.0 would solve that problem, i think that's overkill. you also have to consider that mineral prices are not static, so there really is no way to balance it so that you make as much isk on each ore. all we need is for it to be made significantly more feasible to mine lowends. if i could make about half as much isk per hour mining jaspet or veldspar in 0.0 as i could mining the abc's, i'd definitely do it for the sake of local production."
12/5/2008,so the small scale operations would export it whereas the larger ones(the ones this would really be for) would finally be making even on things. i don't see this as destroying the economy especially with the massive increase in trit prices.
12/5/2008,"wonder if they'll go the ""unrefined reaction"" route. take 25 units of megacyte and change it over to 250000 units of tritanium. something along those lines..."
12/5/2008,did i inadvertantly say that? i certainly didn't mean to imply the economy would be destroyed by the change .
12/5/2008,solitude is a terrible region that has a cluster of pretty much entirely worthless space that is too far from anything to get anywhere.can this be looked at? a highsec region cut off from other highsec regions by either dozens of lowsec jumps or ~6 0.0 jumps is pretty worthless to everyone./me is bitter :|

12/5/2008,didn't notice this when i did my search last nightsee also my suggestion
12/5/2008,an excellent idea. however some of us still won't get onto many kills because our targets tend to live.
12/5/2008,"it'd actually be better for you to not have remote reppers on killmails, since killmail records can inform the enemy of which names to watch out for, and the information there can be used to determine enemy tactics (e.g. you might be using remote-repping ships in a fleet fight without the enemy realizing it; recording this on killmails would give away your tactics).i really don't give a ****."
12/5/2008,"it's epeen versus intel control - op clearly comes down on the pro-epeen side. i don't care much, but given that the current killmail system doesn't care much about controlling intel, it seems like a waste of time to start now."

12/6/2008,"i also heard that ccp shot it down because it wouldn't make an interesting addition (they argued that you'd check your ship once and then never look at it again), which i agree with to a certain degree. the point is that it could be made much more interesting.for example, imagine walking around in a corridor overlooking several ship bays, where you could get glances of different players' ships. you could have a chat with a friend while overlooking the battleship bays or take a stroll down frigate avenue. perhaps you could even get a look at the tube, where ships of all sizes are towed into the station for docking.granted, this would require quite a bit of work from the code department and probably be a massive server/graphics hog. to ease the load, perhaps only have a set number of ships render in public spaces, meaning that there would be no need to assign every ship to a specific spot in the station. there might even be a way to request or purchase a public spot for those who want to show off their fancy new ship or collectors item.docking scenes would not be required. a solution might be to have blinds close at the window into the hangar at the start of undock procedures (a safety precaution, as if the hangar is compressed a broken pane of glass might explode, or something). these would then remain closed until the station has rendered the spot's new vessel.naturally, there's a lot of potential issues with the idea, but the bottom line is that i support the idea of being able to see at least your own ship in ambulation, and that the ability to do so is not entirely inane."
12/6/2008,supported for lulz
12/6/2008,idea makes too much sense to happen.
12/6/2008,"i'm fine with pirates. i'm fine with scrammers. i'm fine with people attacking trade convoys moving through low sec.what i have a problem with is ships don't need to rely on warp scramblers to stop fleeing vessels if they just have a single fast ship in their fleet.there's an entire class of ships (with costs upwards of 60 million) designed to evade gate camps, but what good is an occator with +8 warp strength when you don't need scrammers to stop people, you just bump into them with a frigate a few times?i think this seriously needs to be addressed. like i said, i'm fine with gate camping, but you should at least have to work for it, and bumping like that completely negates the purpose of transport class ships and turns warp core stabilizers into a worthless defense.one possibly solution i thought of was if a ship collides with yours, it pushes you to the side but doesn't rotate your ship. if you want to trap somebody, you should have to use warp core destabilizers or warp scramblers.another option would be to alter all of the transport ships so that they don't take anywhere near as long to warp. if you get a ship for the purpose of getting it through lowsec/nosec camps having it be crippled by any single frigate in the game is rather frustrating.my basic premise is this: in order to keeps ships from warping, you should have to use warp scrams/disruptors. it's that simple. as this stand, chicanery can get you just as far which doesn't seem reasonable.[edited to fix typos, added 2nd suggestion, clarifications]"
12/6/2008,"i've noticed that with the dst's, doesn't matter that they have warp core stabs built in, they take so long to align they're easy to bump. i guess the easy way to fix bumping would be to have the ship trying to do the bumping to bounce off, and the target ship be unaffected. i'd prefer to see collisions and damage involved to the bumping ship but i read someplace that the engine isn't designed for that sort of thing."
12/6/2008,"i stand to disagree with you. shoving somebody is a legitimate way of forcing someone to stay in their place since the beginning of time. something about equal and opposite reactions. i mean, if somebody shoves you from the front, why would you fly sideways?besides, you're flying a ship that says in its description that its one of the slowest ships in eve - why don't you use the other, faster, cloaky one? it seems much more suited to what you're doing, anyway."
12/6/2008,"in that case, what's the purpose of deep space transports? what's the purpose of warp stabilizers in general, if they don't work (at least work insofar as they're supposed to)?i can accept the idea of ramming and damage. if some guy in a frigate plans on ramming my transport, we should both be damaged. and as far as being pushed sideways, what i meant was the ship moves but doesn't rotate. that way its jump isn't misaligned.as far as the ship flying sideways, that's what i meant. you move directly away from where they would have impacted you, but at the very least make shoving like that require something a little more advanced than ""right click - approach,"" and them move over 150m/s.however, with the colliding, there's an entire class of ship that's completely worthless except as a money hole.at least make it so your ship can't be misaligned when you engage warp, cause i understand in dogfighting with small fast ships bumping has a practical value. but it shouldn't completely supersede the need for warp destabilizers, especially when used against ships that have a bonus to warp core stability.another possible alternative would be to have ships become completely immobile when activating warp engines (instead of accellerating in a direction). this would make bumping in combat useful like it was, but make it so that to stop somebody from warping, you need to have the tools to keep them from warping.[edit i always think of something else to add after i hit enter, like the 2nd suggestion]"
12/6/2008,"bumping ships in order to prevent them for warping has been a valid technique for a long time. it is not very easy to do, you need skills to do it, and it has its counters: agile ships cannot be prevented from warping because they realign faster than the time needed for the bumper to make another bump. all you need to do is fit inertia stabs on your occator. or take a more agile ship for transporting stuff. bumping in general could be revisited but not with the purpose to make the transportation using 8x warp core stabbed occators safer."
12/6/2008,"i highly disagree. bumping ships, especially at gates where you cant be sure of where the person will materialize at, is extremly difficult to accomplish. keeping them bumped after the intial one is also not the easiest thing in the world esp if it's not a big ship. warp core stabs shouldnt be the end-all way to evade camps."
12/6/2008,"equal and opposite reactions are fair enough, but that only applies to the energy involved. a frigate ramming a huge transport should not be able to move it as much as it does, and it would move it on a vector from the original frigate's trajectory - i.e. it would move to the side, it would not rotate.this is entirely down to game mechanics, and has nothing to do with real-life. yes it's very difficult to do, and it's even harder to implement properly (hitting the rear of the ship should rotate it around it's center of gravity), but the current way of doing it is completely wrong, as oppose to just slightly wrong."
12/6/2008,but in space you could move a freighter with a shuttle. question is warp is a alternate state isnt it? gaining speed to warp is kinda pointless as a state of warp is a bubble of space time. in which the warpcore crates a bubble. which is my understanding of it. prob wrong.
12/6/2008,"i've always had an issue with bumping since i played the game for the first time.there is absolutely no purpose for it.... if you could physically cause damage to the ship who bumped you and like wise the guy who gets bumped... then i'd be ok with it.but all it is... is some metaphysical nudge that can be triggered by just being within 5 to 10,000 meters.and thats just stupid... dare say... abuse of the nature of collisions in game.sorry guys.... either bumping gets more realistic... or it gets yanked.course i'm not stupid enough to think this will be changed immedately..but i will voice my opinion on the matter.you want to know what bumping should be?go play homeworld cataclysm.ramming frigate ftw./signed"
12/6/2008,"ok, i can see your argument that at all times just more warp stabs shouldn't be safer. but on that same note, the occator is intended for safe transport. looking at my build (level 4 in both of the skills that affect the occator and can make it warp faster), even having only +4 to warp strength (after 2 skills) and having 4 intertial stabilizer iis, the reduction in jump time is only about 3 to 4 seconds (meaning the occator is still a joke). i can understand the idea that 1 method of doing something shouldn't always be perfect, but on the other hand, as it stands now deep space transports are just a liability because of that tradeoff of more stabs for a very long alignment time. i think the standard on an occator is 25 seconds or thereabouts (unskilled and without bonuses)."
12/6/2008,"no ship is supposed to be immune, just because you have a pimped out hauler doesnt mean that youll never lose it. bumping has always been a valid strategy and like many other people have said in this thread a very difficult thing to do properly. eve is eve. rl is rl. as much as some people like to think otherwise. they aren't supposed to be exactly the same. if you dont want to lose ships then i suggest you dont go into lowsec or 0.0."
12/6/2008,"i'm not suggesting the ships be immune. nowhere in my post have i suggested they make occator's immune to ecms. what i'm suggesting is that a ship designed to jump through gate camps not be completely rendered obsolete due to one guy in a frigate with a mwd.nothing is impossible to overcome. but it shouldn't be that easy. and yes, i've gate camped using ramming as a tactic. if it's difficult for you to do, you're not that good a pilot. i've never had any issues using it whatsoever. however, that doesn't mean i think it's either fair or not exploitative."
12/6/2008,"i could support this initiative if it does not put a big load on the eve database itself, with killboard fetching kills like crazy all the time. i suggest adding the specifcation of the cache duration (preferably long = 1h) for this feature. furthermore, you should rename the thread to something that better fits the assembly hall naming scheme and better describes the problem, e.g. [request] addition of final blow filter to killmail api"
12/6/2008,"this thread was asking for everyone on a killmaill to be sent a copy. even if it meant that killmails wouldn't go out at all until the next downtime.that would be a good solution for me as the only reason i want killmails to come through fast is so that i can keep hassling whoever gets it until they post it. but if i know i will be getting a copy, that won't be an issue."
12/6/2008,"incorrect. that was an unintended bug, possibly related to the changes that stopped doomsdays bypassing pos shields, and it was corrected in a patch shortly after qr was released.however, the idea of a dictor bubble acting as a doomsday shield is a pretty cool one, and would be a step towards making titans less ridiculous than they are now."
12/6/2008,this
12/6/2008,"except that itsa: not important that titans as ships not get nerfed too hard by the change.titans are, without any weapons, some of the strongest assets any alliance has. the jump bridge alone pays for the ship in spades and can be used pretty much risk free for the titans entire life. in fact, the only argument against removing dd's that has any weight is that stupid people wouldn't risk their titans and would not then get the massively valuable jump bridging alliance asset blown up.b: its very important that dd's are nerfed to all hell to the point that they are effectively removed from the game. large scale aoes are stupid. beyond stupid, horribly stupid. they are the worst possible option that you could add to a game designed around pvp. we have had many discussions regarding this in many different places, we have gone over the theoretical backing that shows, in pretty clear terms why large scale aoes are ******ed. [specifically it performs similar to nuclear weapons. as titans do not fight themselves, there is no real strategic or tactical options that allow a force without a titan to defeat one with(ignoring lag)]doomsdays pretty much need to be removed. not ""nerfed"", not ""modified"", not ""reduced in strength"", but, at the very least ""removed entirely as expressed in their current form. halving damage? adding explosion velocity and radius? doesn't cut it. halve its range? doesn't cut it. turn it into ewar? doesn't cut it. entirely removed in any form to how it functions currently is the answer."
12/6/2008,"hello, fellow (industry/barge) pilots i'd like to propose my little ideas for improvements on the use of survey scanners.so far, i have three ideas, which some of you also might have had a thought on about already. increase the range by a few km on all survey scanners, except t1, up to 25km on the t2 version.with the orca boosting the hulks now, their range exceeds the current maximum of 22km on the survey scanner ii by one or two km more, depending on ics skill.i have no experience in being boosted by a rorqual, but with the slightly higher command bonus, a strip miner might even exceed 25km?if one also takes the ""ore strip miner"" into account, the range of the survey scanner ii could/should be even around 30km? ...just guessing here. add another column, named ""m3 quantity""currently its a bit tedious, if you see the quantity being left, one has to do a rough guess how many cubic metres this will be. especially when violating a belt alone, mining all ores being available, one always has to refigure on quantity/m3_per_ore_type.if you would implement this, i'd also appreciate a ""total"" at the bottom, which adds up the overall available m3 of all ore types in scan range. with this any scout could easily judge on the value in that belt - means how long it could withstand punishment of multiple barges add an asteroid ""health bar"", but only when a survey scan was done beforewhen one hits the survey scanner, the barge should be able to keep this information and show the remaining m3 just below the locked asteroid. like with npcs, a health bar, or just a simple text-display of the m3 left in there would do fine as well./edit: auto-update with further cycles would be most sexy, otherwise hitting the survey scanner after a few cycles wouldnt be a problem at all - since i do want to increase the usage of these here anyway currently the survey scanner is already quite useful, in terms of getting a rough idea whats available or left in scanned asteroids.with these changes, a survey scanner would become a vital part of any asteroid mining vessel, especially the barges. i for one do think, that these changes are an improvement to usability and would most likely be welcome by any barge pilot out there for rp reasons (do people rp mining? ), one could say that the specialized electronics on a mining barge / exhumer should be well able to keep the information gathered by a survey scanner.also, as it is a mining vessel, and the survey scanner being a mining-only module, it could get a little more importance in terms of fitting it.please take these ideas as a pure proposal, and feel free to alter/improve them to your thoughts"
12/6/2008,supporting my own stuff
12/6/2008,i see no issue with it so supported aswell.
12/6/2008,i like./supported
12/6/2008,"you do know the orca has a 500% bonus to survey scanner range right? and if you turn on tags and make the orca pilot gang boss, they can tag the bigger roids?"
12/6/2008,"yes, i know, but thanks this would only cover idea 1, related to scanner range in general.and it sounds like leaving smaller roids behind? when we drop our ships in a belt, we usually do not leave until every roid is gone with 22km+ range most of the belts are covered with 3 or 4 barges. and when a gang has more vessels then being viable to place in a single belt, the orca cannot provide its scan to barges being in a different belt.(being hauled separately then - nettles the haulers, but thats a different story )"
12/6/2008,this would make me love my survey scanner...more.
12/6/2008,"that's pretty much the intended effect, because the two are separate games with the potential to have more 'fun' activities if they are allowed to become slightly independent."
12/6/2008,steps in the right direction.
12/6/2008,still no new negative opinions?
12/6/2008,"poses are a bizarre hybrid of everything, and they need some work because of it. they're industrial, transportation, military, logistics, and sovereignty structures, and that's too many hats for one tower to be wearing. i'd actually lean towards breaking it up further than you've done with this proposal, but this is a good start."
12/6/2008,"couldnt hurt, but wont fix the problem. logistical modules, partic the cyno/bridge related ones, have far too many hit points for a small gang (10-20 non-bs ships) to take down in a reasonable amount of time. this coupled with a hitpoint+sig radius reduction would promote some interesting results."
12/6/2008,edited op to include looking at these changes
12/6/2008,"why indeed, for they were of waste of developer resources and they really aren't that important.the only reason they were put in is so people can get their banana stickers."
12/6/2008,"err, but when the certificates point you in a completely meaningless direction, how does that benefit a youngster?as an amarr pilot, the shields on my ship are meaningless for pve, and barely worth considering in pvp. however the presence of these skills, prominently, in the armor tanking tree might give a new amarr pilot the impression that shield skills would be useful to them, when with very few exceptions, they will actually be almost useless."
12/6/2008,"first you can talk to an agent after you deny a mission, you just can not turn another down within four hours without taking a hit to standings.is there such a thing as a multiple part storyline mission? or are you talking about one of the multiple mission arcs? if you are talking about an arc then you can deny the mission like all others. no penalty except you do not get to complete the arc. i guess that could suck, but it is not something that kills your progression. also another point, other then checking out eve agents and moving away from low sec, is to try and find a system where you have multiple stations within 2-3 jumps so if you do deny a mission you can jump to another agent for a couple of hours.if there is such a thing as a multi mission storyline arc then i am newly informed.i have denied missions in the past for not wanting to take faction standing hits. if i was unwilling to take a chance on a nother mission with that agent, or was unable to move to a new agent, i jumped in my mining boat and looked at some lasers for a few hours. the system works as intended you just need to move to a different system.slade"
12/6/2008,"yes, there are storyline arc with multiple separate missions in them. only the last mission of the arc is a true storyline with the faction gain, but you need to complete the previous missions to get it. you can refuse it at any point of the arc without any damage (you simply don't gain the standing increase/rewards, as usual), but it can be annoying to run 3 of 4 episodes of the arc to get the last step in a ""bad"" system. i have no problem running them in lowsec (barring getting it in rancer or something similar ) but for someone that want to totally avoid low sec it can be a pain, especially as the other missions of the arc have generally low rewards.not sure it it need to be changed tbh, some incentive that make you dip your toe in low sec to see how it is isn't bad. at most i would see the reward modified by the system where you do the mission, not the system where you get it."
12/6/2008,"thanks everyone for their advice/input on this subject.the mission in question was ""whispers in the dark"". the fourth and final part of which was where i would have received an implant and a decent bonus payout, it was based in lo sec where as the previous three parts were in high sec.my prefered method of gameplay is not to enter lo sec, thats a choice i make and i fully understand anyone who might think this is strange, but thats the way it is :)i just feel that mission runners should be at least given a choice whether to take a decent payout and go into lo sec to complete or take a lesser payout and stay in high sec, without having to reject the mission."
12/6/2008,"move to an agent in .7 sec system, afaik they never send you to a system more than 2 sec status' lower than the one the agent is in."
12/6/2008,she agrees with you i am reading. if i understand zeur she is saying fix missions to keep the game pure or remove them entirely for the same reason.hence agreement at a high level
12/6/2008,or just take all the things that make it eve and call it hello kitty in space like youd rather have it? im srry but pvp is part of the game. if ya dont like it dont play. im more carbear then pvper but everytime i undock i know im taking the risk to lose it all! its why i enjoy eve.
12/6/2008,ok... lets call it pvp online and force everyone to pvp at will with no choice at all.oh wait.... there's already a game that does that.warhammer online.maybe you should go try it sometime.
12/6/2008,"yes - probing out mission runner is way too easy, having the rats helping the pirate make it even easier, the difference in reward and risk don't make worthwhile to run missions in low sec, the standing loss for failing mission is a problem in low sec.no - instancing the mission isn't a solution.the real problem is always the percentage of pirates against non pirates in low sec. but probably it can't be cured as increasing the number of non pirates automatically increase the number of pirates. as i already said in another thread:- the pirates will not be happy to get less than a prey every hours, better more than that;- the non pirates will not be happy losing a ship every 10 hours. as we don't have 10 non pirates to 1 pirate in low sec all are unhappy."
12/6/2008,its called pvp online. it is called eve. started 5 yrs ago. warhammer stole the idea from eve.
12/6/2008,"this has been mentioned a while back, atleast within the year anyways, however...with the recent introduction of qr and the (nerf) of missiles as it were, perhaps its time to look into actually adding that 5th high slot to the phoenix. the explosion velocity of citadel torpedos has plummeted to a base 29m/s, with siege module at a 92.5% velocity reduction bringing them down to a mere 2.175m/s, this is useless for anything except the sieging of pos'/outposts, as any sort of capital battle citadel torpedos would be near useless.the phoenix also is on the low end of the dps spectrum in regards to other dreadnoughts as well, the additional blaster/rail that the 5th high slot would allow would add little more to the dps/alpha of the phoenix class dreadnought. missiles were difficult to pvp with before (and before being accused of anything, yes i still pvp with them) however qr has definitely made it more difficult.additionally, we're still lacking faction citadel torpedos whereas every other xl weapons system has faction ammunition available.please don't discuss the naglfar shortcomings in this thread, moros and revelation are by far the two best and yes nag has problems, but this is a thread about the issues with the phoenix only."
12/6/2008,supporting my own topic.
12/6/2008,"the problems with the phoenix are the problems with citadel torps in general. fix those - up their dps or something - and both the phoenix problem and the naglfar problem go away. given that they can do the least(no uberdrones to provide flexibility, no general revelation awesomeness), they should be balanced towards having the highest dps, instead of their current state of having the least. also, 2.175 m/s is plenty for shooting a dread in siege mode."
12/6/2008,"i'll support this for faction citadel torps, but that's it. additionally:why? because you trained for it?"
12/6/2008,"i would like to see faction citadel torps or maybe t2 citadel torps, one dmg torp for pos operations and maybe a precision/speed t2 cit torp for anti cap ship operations. just a though..."
12/6/2008,"missiles should become a specialized damage type, and have their damage output raised considerably.for example, rather than having 4 different missiles, one for each type of damage, convert them into primarily: explosive, secondary: thermal.up the dps on them since most shields should be able to withstand missile hits while it wreaks havoc on armor/hulls.edit: i also would convert projectile ammo to primary: kinetic, secondary: explosive."
12/6/2008,"not supported at all. while the phoenix has limitations, such as relative ineffectiveness against smaller pos modules, it has the advantage of dealing full damage at all ranges, which is a serious limitation to other weapon systems. adding a 4th missile hardpoint would make it by far the highest dps dreadnought in a conventional fitting, particularly since the shield tank allows it to fit 3 damage mods without sacrificing a burst tank (at least). if you seriously intend any sort of action, you need to put out some hard numbers in the op in any event, not just contend that it's not up to par."
12/6/2008,"so basically, you want to do a complete 180 on missiles and projectiles as weapons. i do believe that falls outside the spectrum of 'fix a few problems with the caldari dread'."
12/6/2008,"i do agree that low sec needs some special attention because things just aren't right atm. removing the gate guns will certainly not fix the problem. it will just make players avoid these areas much more often.i think ccp needs to take a loot at piracy in general. the methods pirates use are done out of necessity because they have no other means to do their business. piracy, as a whole, needs a ravamp and improvement in all sectors of space.here's what i think. improve gate guns to be effective deterrent to piracy and ganking in general. give pirates their own makeshift jump gates (maybe ones that spawn and despawn to prevent gate camping), stations, and agents in all sectors of space. basically an entire underground for pirates. of course, concords response to high sec piracy would have to be modified."
12/6/2008,"currently you can't put up a contract for or offering items which are deemed illegal in any jurisdiction, even if they are completely legal in your current location.you should at least be able to contract items with legality restrictions in places where they are legal. for example you cannot put up a contract containing slaves in amarr because they are illegal in jita. you can't sell amarr navy tags by contract in pator because they're illegal in sharhelund yet you can put them on the open market. you can't contract protein delicacies anywhere because the federation think they're the devil's own satanic biscuits.a ""contains illegal items!"" warning saying what and where it is illegal should sort out most problems and something along the lines of the ""route contains lowsec"" warning that courier missions used to give would sort out any funny business involving courier contracts taking slaves to pator."
12/6/2008,...i support this.
12/6/2008,"minor thing, but supported.. there have been multiple times where i want to move items between characters.. or perhaps get a contract from a buddy who has tags i'd like to use in the store and i can't because they're illegal items... i don't see how its more legal to be telling the entire universe you're selling gallente/caldari fleet tags in the open market than making private contracts that only the seller and the buyer know the ""illegal"" contents.. would think the opposing faction navy would hate you more for the former than the latter."
12/6/2008,"the contract should have the same legal status as a market order, and a courier contract should have the same legal status as just holding the stuff in your cargo. i haven't ever run across this, but if that's how it works, then that is a problem."
12/6/2008,"for auctions/item exchanges allow the contracts to be made in any systems where the items are legal with a warning about them being illegal in some places. if the player wants details, he can view the items info."
12/6/2008,i agree with op.
12/6/2008,"i completely agree with you. i don't have time to change a series of 15minute-6hour skills because when i come home, i have a total of three hours total before i go to sleep (and that's if i don't eat or engage in social activities) and have to wake up the next day and do the same thing again. this just forces me to turn on a long skill all week, and i never run short skills for fear of missing training time.i log in when i have time. and it would be helpful if training 12 hours of a series of short skills was as easy as simply leaving a long skill running (which i do now)hell, you can even check my in-eve. i got a lot of long skills trained and really, really short skills trained, but skills requiring from from 3-10 hours can only be trained on the weekend."
12/6/2008,get a job. you have better things to do than mooch off of your mom.
12/6/2008,"i hear all this talk about ""not"" having a skill queue making players angry/upset etc...they havent had a skill queue for 5 years.. if you haven't quit due to lack of it by now, then its not whats going to make you quit anyways."
12/6/2008,create new char and find long skills to train :d
12/6/2008,usually it's not just one factor that makes you quit but a bunch. ignoring the skill queue might play a more significant part in it than you think.
12/6/2008,"true, it isn't a big enough issue to make us quit over it alone. but if there are enough small issues, they can easily get to a point where someone quits over them, despite none of them being large enough on their own.then there are the people who did quit over the lack of a skill queue who may return if one is implemented."
12/6/2008,i agree with this.even being able to put 1 skill in queue while traning 1 would be enuff for me.
12/6/2008,"hello all, i was recently sitting in station admiring my new phoenix and i was planning my move back out to my alliance area, i noticed with ammo and fuel in the hold that cargo space is limited, almost non-exsistant. i suppose that it is the same for most other cap ships so i wanted to propose that ccp add fuel bays to cap ships, sort of like the drone bays but will only allow fuel. maybe the fuel bay could hold enough fuel for 2-4 jumps. let me know what you guys think. cheers"
12/6/2008,"i seem to remember a slightly different history. please, as someone who represents me in eve, attempt to be more careful with your facts.if this is just a game not to be taken seriously, what does that say about your seat on the csm?"
12/6/2008,by the way... you still haven't delivered.
12/6/2008,or maybe he has?
12/6/2008,thank you for quoting the exact and only post where it is insinuated that this had anything to do with votes. you could have left my sarcastic reply out of it.
12/6/2008,from tears to bravado. the john declan story.
12/6/2008,from flames to inaccurate statements. the tale of one small johnson.
12/6/2008,"you guys seem pretty upset over this whole ordeal, want to talk about it?"
12/6/2008,darius and other csm. i wanted to just say. this is csm not you alter epeen egos. you say we mistook your words or whatever. in this forum jita speakers. its csm to player. and player to csm. i really wish you could separate your rl scrupples to you ingame epeen. i for one take the issues you represnt me for verry serious. i voted for somone who i thought could do the job who wanted todo the job and could be serious. if you just wanted a epeen stoke you should have not run. plain and simple. so dont get upset when some of us want you to be the csm rep and not (example only) goonhonda! i dont care what faction or allience your in in this forum. i care what you do as a player represenative. keep your epeen crap in the coad where it belongs. again darius i voted for you because you impressed me with what you acomplished as csm. not what you did as a goon ingame. i could care less. unless you make threats to other csm with wardecs if they dont follow your will. kidding or not. i dont think its funny or shows you take what you asked tobe seriously.
12/6/2008,"there are neither any flames, nor inaccurate statements by me in this thread. feel free to point them out and actually have to back your bold statements. it may be a new concept for you but you'll learn eventually."
12/6/2008,"hey, posting on a forum detracts from my role as csm representative in no way. just sayin'. chill out."
12/6/2008,"it was kinda implied in the old mining mk ii thread you posted, and i cross posted some of your stuff to this one, so ehh,kinda.i'd like the sliding scale to apply to all minerals, so everyone has a choice about what to mine no matter their location.i suppose the difference between our two corps is you guys don't have the player base we do. i can count on people to buy dozens of battleships per week on the open market down south, almost as fast as they're made. that's way more trit than hauler spawns can account for, which is why we end up needing mineral compression.the other thing we use a ton of trit for is capital ships, and making a ms or titan in 0.0 without all the shuffling of materials makes for a much easier time if you can buy locally produced stuff at or about the jita prices."
12/6/2008,"this isn't about corp size, my reference was when iss were in tenerifis. the navy never bothered to exploit the masses of minerals on the market down in c3-0yd and as a result we had dirt cheap trit and dirt cheap highends packed on the market. so it's really a matter of organisation. we can assume that any decent 0.0 pvp-oriented force is going to tear through lowend minerals so fast they'll need to import as that's the norm. but with iss i saw a condition that i've also seen in other areas of 0.0 - without a strongly organised pvp force in the area, cheap trit builds up on the market and some people do end up exporting it."
12/6/2008,i love solitude and i don't want to see it changed.it's called solitude for a reason. cause hardly anyone goes there.

12/7/2008,"i think that changing people's names would be a good thing for immersion into the game, maybe allow a name change when you do a character transfer?that reduces the scam usage to real serious scammers with a lot of money to burn, and allows people that have bought a character to not have to live with some really bad immersion destroying names.ps. i like my name."
12/7/2008,"absolutely not. scammers are rife enough without this. also it would kind of mess up things if you are hunting someone to kill...people would just go 'oshi, ive upset half the galaxy, time for a name change...'"
12/7/2008,"would it matter? with your level of reading comprehension even tt could scam you, having representatives of iac there vouching for him being a notorious scammer and you still parting with your goods on faith alone.as for the people being hunted, those typically take great pride in being the scourge of eve, those who doesn't just buy and sell themselves a new skin, your fears will get us nowhere."
12/7/2008,"oh boy i'd really love to change the name of an not-so-stealth-but-well-skilled alt might just introduce a ""recent names"" list just as the corporations are being kept in which one has been before.anyway, fully supported."

12/7/2008,"here's my idea for abandoned pos's the ability to ""assume control"" of an abandoned pos. the only stipulation you would need would be something like control tower has to be unfueled for over a week before you are able to assume control and do with it as you please. so basically the hacking thing people are talking about."

12/7/2008,not to mention the amount of craptastic dmg a citadel torp does to a moving cap ship. the new explosion velocity/radius rates are terrible.
12/7/2008,"i agree :(. new explosion velocity is just rediculous. i can see, like, an interceptor or something avoiding parts of a blast, but when missiles start doing minor damage against ships of the class they were designed for, it puts a major impediment on missile user's fun./signed"
12/7/2008,"signedthis is the second time you have nerfed missiles to a point of being useless.last time ccp added more or less a new skill tree that included speed boost, rate of fire boost, and damage boost etc. i didn't complain then because there more or less a way out. now i have sunk all the skill pts into missiles and they are wortless again. it's plain to see players like using missiles dispite the fact they are already nearly useless in pvp other than pos shooting. now they are a total waste of time. i've been playing since about two weeks after go live and i can say you guys have over done it this time. you can change the numbers but the degree of change as it stands is too much. i find it harder and harder to keep my accounts going at present this isn't any help."
12/7/2008,stupid nerf.
12/7/2008,even tho i have 4mil in missiles and 2.5 in gunnery(awu v) still fix missiles me need to do missions and create boom
12/7/2008,"the missile nerf as a whole was necesary, getting an interceptor flying at 7km/second shot up by cruise missiles was ridiculous, but yes, it shouldnt be that missiles are only any use against bigger class than the missile.i think frigs should be too fast to easily hit with large missiles, but having cruise missiles not doing full damage to slow as hell bss is silly.having said that, a raven was hitting my 5km/s ceptor with missiles last week... so not sure its really as bad as caldari pilots are making out."
12/7/2008,"i'll be running for csm next time, assuming i can ever get my passport sorted...the blaster issue is still an issue that needs to be addressed. switching to lasers isn't 'addressing' the issue.i've continued to experiment, test and adapt my play style to the changes, and it's boiling down to just stopping the use of blasters on anything other than a kronos. that concept isn't workable for me and most other players."
12/7/2008,"love this idea.sharing them with corp/alliance/random people would also be awesome.*edit, i bet this is the first topic that i agree with that the csm posting above me also supports."
12/7/2008,great idea for overview settings export.
12/7/2008,supporting :-) would be a very nice feature to have :-)
12/7/2008,i miss cis face

12/7/2008,bump because i'd really like to have the timers decreased(and this final bump will also repair page 1 of the assembly hall )
12/7/2008,"supporting the 10% per level, requires infomorph psych v & science v version."
12/7/2008,would be nice
12/7/2008,"would be nice to see it added as a short-cut to the ui. (ie. user-assignable key). you can assign a key already for opening people & places. the advantage of having a short-cut key assign to a deep-menu is also that it doesn't lag-out the client (and requires less server communication) when you don't open the people & places window first.the only problem might be that it's contextual - so some code would be required if you hit the key when you're docked. although in wis, would be nice if it book marked your location inside the station, and you would ""auto-walk"" to the location, rather than having to manually navigate.while they're at it, pls ask ccp to assign hot-keys to all sub-menus."
12/7/2008,"fail.tracking comps do not fully counter tracking disruptors.targeting comps do not fully counter sensor damps.both only partially mitigate the effects of one, but (as with ecm) you will seldom see a ship fitting just one... or fleets with only 1 pilot using them (unless they're recon ships or ewar frigs)."
12/7/2008,"instead of boost eccm , why not nerf sensor boosters especially scan resolution scripts . nowadays too many ppl fly their ships with 2-3 scan resoltuion scripted sensor boosters,which only has one stupid benefit that my ship which is normally fitted can't lock lone enemies in time before they go poop. so if we nerf scan resolution scrips then these ppl will get some free mid slots and can fit eccm-s there, and with those huge eccm increase in fittings falcons will be nerfed indirectly.this is a perfect plan.no need for eccm boost ,and ccp is happy as they can nerf again."
12/7/2008,its not the ecm or eccm strength thats the problem.the problem is the range bonus on ecm ships making them able to jam at 200km range
12/7/2008,god forbid that the long range sniping race should have a long range sniping e-war capability.

12/7/2008,bump!
12/7/2008,i agree with this idea.
12/7/2008,"easy idea, very helpful"
12/7/2008,"yeah, like... duh, really. all the crap above the assembly hall makes you have to work to find it. the board listings need a total reordering."
12/7/2008,"lol no , whats the reason behind it ? nothingbut put in patchnotes which changes were implemented thanks to csm. it would help ppl know what csm doing :p"
12/7/2008,"what does csm do? ccp dont care about you anyway.thumbs down, though i would support to ban useless csm-forum from the database."
12/7/2008,simple and sweet solution.
12/7/2008,"perhaps getting missions to podkill random other pirate for possible security status increase? possible as to not be certain, it could be you getting their bounty payout only, 1-5m paid for mission accomplished or that ss increase, by no means a certainty but enough for pirates to start looking warily at eachother."
12/7/2008,"interesting, cept they just changed the security status increase system because it was too easy, this would just make it easier...but i'm all for it."
12/7/2008,there should be 2 roles required to affect a pos's defensive systems.default = anyone who can get inside the shield can man the guns. attempting to access an offline gun will automatically attempt to bring it online if the tower has enough power. alliance members cannot access the ammunition store.corp members are required (with the proper roles) to unload or unanchor the guns as well as offline them.
12/7/2008,"would that not allow a spy in the alliance to ""man"" but not fire? sure, that's possible right now with the corp, but this extends that to a far larger field of possible enemy operatives. and unlike other games, you can't just kill the enemy spy."
12/7/2008,easy don't give him the role. problem solved now let's get this change in effect.edit: remember to add your support people
12/7/2008,"iirc you can get pos guns to shoot at other pos guns (for hilarious effect) and when you leave the said gun, it keeps shooting at the last gun it was aimed at.so this needs be fixed as a ""bug"" if you're going to allow non-corp members to start using it!"
12/7/2008,"supporting this - i also recall that some dev already found love for the idea, that smaller ships reach their max. warp speed faster than larger class vessels?anyway, please - as said before, a 13.5 au ceptor rarely can take advantage of full warp speed - needs looooong distances"
12/7/2008,this has been a long standing head scratch for me. really hard to intercept something when your ship only hits its top speed for a second or two then goes the same speed as the slowest bs.
12/7/2008,"fully support, i hate chasing a bs into warp with my ceptor and reaching the destination at the same time or slightly after, it gives me headaches and makes me drink vodka :-p"
12/7/2008,"flagshipsthe concept of this ship class is to make a larger evolution of the command ship. instead of simply creating larger ones, the people in the forum and i have blended the bonuses and stats to make the ships more command oriented then straight up combat. the main feature being that they all have a smaller version of the titans fleet bonus. the reason for this is to make them idea for assaulting cyno-jammed systems and giving non-capital fleets some edge in facing capital ships and poses. the theory behind them being that they have a big tank and give the fleet around them a more survivability. they are nerfed in many ways to prevent them from being solo machines. they do not put out the same base dps as the base version of each race. however they are not completely lost on the battlefield for firepower.in the greater sense, flagships are designed to help bridge the gulf between the sub-capital ships and the capital ships. while to possessing the brute firepower to take down a capital. its fleet command and control function would aid the fleet attempting such a task.frontline command shipsthese ships are to lead the fleet from the front of the pack. as a result they forgo their electronics support for more endurance and damage output. armed with a bonus to anti-electronic warfare, they can assist other ships in making sure that the damage reaches the target.theater command shipthese are the ships that are oriented around the fleet command and control. their operational mandate is to let their interfacing with the fleet do the talking. allowing the fleet to operate with a bit more freedom then would normally be enjoyed. they are, however, no slouches to combat either. tech 2 resistance bonusesa bonus of +15% and +12.5% are added to specific armor and shields. these are boosted to the race specific areas. for example it would be thermal primary and kinetic secondary for caldari.ship bonusesships have a slightly reduced version of their base ships bonuses. more often then not its a reduction to their damage output rather then tank. this is for balance as to prevent the ships from taking over the role of mission runner or make the tier 3 battleships completely obsolete. they also receive a fleet bonus that only comes into effect when they are in a fleet and they are the assigned bonus ship. other then that some of the ships have been modified to fit in their design forms, khanid ships are missile throwers instead of laser boats for example.fitting bonusall ships gain a fitting slot in either their mids or lows. theater command ships lose 1500 power grid and 35 cpu. frontline command ships lose the same cpu but only 1000 power grid. ships also loose hard points for launchers and turrets, though the exact number and specific hard points lost are specific per ship.stats bonusall ships have a larger signature radius and slightly lower sensor capabilities. their maximum targets number is reduced to 6 targets at once. the rest of the stat changes are individual to each ship ca be seen below.the versions here will be changing depending on what suggestons are made and flaws pointed out. the original discussion is taking place here."

12/7/2008,"broken mechanic, pure and simple. they saw how insane remote ddd was and nerfed it. it's still a problem wasting everything on grid in a single shot (friendlies, too) without even half trying.i don't say remove them... i say make them 100k times as expensive as a bomb to deploy... after all, a bomb costs a small fortune and does a smackingly large aoe attack. not enough to kill one drone with the damage calculations currently used, but, eh. i titan just does so bloody much damage with a shot that they don't care about damage calcs.make it expensive, pure and simple. 100-300 mil per shot would work, considering how much it can destroy in a single blow. make the titan deploying alliance have to calculate how much isk the ddd will cost their enemy, and how much they might recoup in loot...... oh, and make ddds destroy everything on the ship. no drops."

12/7/2008,"i'm sorry, but let me clarify something.1)certificates are useless, anyway, but i post this for clarification.2)the cert is called ""armor tanking, elite""3)the requirements in a nutshell are:->a)hull upgrades v->b)mechanic v->c)repair systems v->d)armor comp skills v->e)shield management vso, since the supposed purpose of certs are to help numb-nut newbies sort their way through an already staggering array of skills, why would maxing a shield skill make any sense at all in a cert called armor tanking.shield users have the same problem. take passive shield elite cert - why would you need hull upgrades v and mechanic v for shield tankers? i could run a perfect passive tank (and have) without these.besides the few folks who somehow don't realize how shield skills under an armor cert makes no sense whatsoever, the main problem here stems from one cert, which should be scrapped because of redundancy:core integrity.another one that should be tossed is the core competency, which is completely redundant.to be honest, the cert system is a waste of time, but if its to stay in game, at least clean up this piece of junk and make it consistent."
12/7/2008,"i'd agree with the op that the cert system could do with some more effort. now it's in-game, there appear to both useful certs missing + some mis-guided certs.eg. the cartography certs require hacking. surely it would make more sense to call it an ""exploration"" cert. etc. etc.on top of all that, (and maybe i'm mistaken), but there isn't an option to request specific certs in the corp job advertisement section, which imo would be a great use for certs - both for people applying and corps with vacancies."
12/7/2008,"as a general rule most non-fw agents only send you a few jumps away within the same region, typically the same constellation.i regularly get missions that are 6j away, which can be annoying as heck in a bs, but never in lowsec as the nearest is like 10j from my agent.i eat my own words. i got a storyline just now into lowsec... and holy cripes it wants me to move 40k *fourty thousand!!!* cubic meters of 'colossal sealed cargo containers'... holy f*ck! if that doesn't scream 'here i come, gank the sh*t out of my slow ass hauler' then nothing does!wtf are you mission designers smoking? or are all of you pvp hores?"
12/7/2008,lol nice 1 sostoned......i sympathise!
12/7/2008,"skimmed didn't see this. find different agent that isn't in a mission hub?!don't use drones, that's probably how they're finding you.declare war on them and own them, somehow. in fact i think the war mechanic was designed specifically for you. declare war on them, and when they get tired of being owned and ask for forgiveness make them promise to never 'harass' another mission runner ever again."
12/7/2008,"this is not a hand holding game, protect yourself."
12/7/2008,"instances!? absolutely not...to date my mission runner alt has never been probed out in high/low sec.there are plenty of ways to avoid getting probed down, use them instead of whining about it..."
12/7/2008,"ok... lets call it pve online and force everyone to pve at will with no choice at all.oh wait.... there is already a game that does that.hello kitty online.maybe you should go try it sometime./sarcasmseriously, eve was started on the principles of being primarily a pvp game, if pvp is not your cup of tea.. fine, the mechanics for avoiding it exist... why try to ruin it for the rest of us who pay to have fun pvping?"
12/7/2008,"meh all these in depth responses in ways they can make it so people cant make it into missions. when all that needs to happen is make it harder to scan out mission sites ex scan times,ext."
12/7/2008,i'm sorry... did you just try to say that its possible to avoid pvp in this game? and yet your trying to force it upon us by not supporting this thread with your reasoning?
12/7/2008,"i totally agree, lets have instancing...but make it specific to certain agents. hell if you don't want ""instances"" don't use the agents who give them out!why is everyone so stuck in the mould of ""...this is the way eve is meant to be played..bla..bla...""?the way todays economy is any mmorpg needs to either hold on to the players it has or try and suck in more players from other games, eve is very open ended in what you want to be, unfortunately due to the amount of alts you can have with one account this also means a lot of grieffing,why? because they can! bored grinding missions or roid raping? just jump in your alt for some all time grieffing action..yay...not!fine if thats the way you want to play but also fine if i want to jump into a closed mission and do my thing, the way i want to do it. nobody's forcing anybody else to do it if they don't want to but give other players the option, it's all about choices."
12/7/2008,"funny, i see the exact opposite. lots of people wanting pvp to be safer and more consentual. much the same as pvper wanting non-pvpers to fight. still best tool a player has is avoid pvp is thinking, if you don't want to fight figure out how use the game mechanics to that end. afterall, thats what us pirates and pvpers do. someone had to put some thought into developing tactics and cookie cutter setups that the rest of the pvp player base popularizes, and hence fotm. why should pve'ers be any different? having seen and understood both sides of the arguement i know forcing and nerfing pve'ers out of highsec and into low sec and 0.0 won't do any good. rather i believe that making adjustments to the rewards and perhaps adding uniqe incentives will encorage some to take a little more risk and venture out of highsec.you accuse me of wanting to force pvp on others, when i am in favor of alternate ideas that do not adversely impact either side, but rather provides new opportunites for both sides( i do believe that is possible) as i mentioned before, i have seen and tried both pvp and pve extensively. can you honestly say the same?"
12/7/2008,"you forget many of the main draws that eve has is the sandbox environment, that many other mmos don't provide. to add instancing would be another nail in the sandbox coffin."
12/7/2008,why would it? what it is doing is giving players the option whether to use instances or not without being forced.
12/7/2008,why would anyone farming isk do anything but use the instanced agents? out of the goodness of their heart?
12/7/2008,"what they would be doing is playing the game the way they want to, too many players in this game are quite happy to dictate what others should/shouldn't do, give players the choice, if you don't want to use those agents well don't then! but if others do want to use them...so be it."
12/7/2008,delete.... messed up on my posting.this is not the thread your looking for... move along.... move along.
12/7/2008,"so citadel torps get buffed in the fact now they dont die as easy to smartbombs, and now if a cap ship is moving past 2m/s full dmg is not applied... great, for an already subpar dmg system.... thank you ccp for ruining something you were trying to fix.please take a look at it. although i do not completely agree with the ops standpoint on adding another highslot/launcher slotwhat i would like is faction torps like nozh promised. and the velocity/explosion radius relooked at for citadels.ffs ccp"
12/7/2008,just give it 3 turret slots and add bonuse for xl rails 10%optimal/lvl 5% dmg/lvl and it will be fine
12/7/2008,"also as far as faction torpsccp nozh said they were going to be made, but didnt come through as promised.his promise can be found in the citadel threadnaught in g&d forum here -"
12/7/2008,"i wouldn't mind seeing turret options added to the phoenix, i think it would take some work though. also, does anyone know if torpedos still dissapear/cause 0 dmg if the siege cycle ends/begins mid torp flight? i remember seeing a thread on this and i couldn't find it again. maybe ccp could look into this issue as well if it is still a problem."
12/7/2008,"i think some people are misunderstanding my post.. i'm not asking for a fourth launcher slot.. i'm asking for a fifth high slot to encourage phoenix pilots to use their single turret slot... which serves absolutely no purpose at this point in time... a 5th high slot with ""no"" additional launcher slots is what i'm suggesting, not a 4th launcher slot."
12/7/2008,"there is no point fitting a lone turret high slot with weapon especially if it is unbonused. oh and mind where would that +1 high slot come from? yeah ccp would just take away a low or med slot thx not. every other dread has a close and long range guns, phoenix only has a torp with close range missile velocity,middle range dmg and 2m+ flight time, it is so stupid .as at long range torps are prety useless, because of huge lag time before it starts dmg the target due to delay dmg it is 2minuses for god sake. and shooting secondary is a nono .because the point of shooting primary is to break remote rep+self repair and kill it as fast as possible and limit these reps on it. and shooting secondary would split your gangs dps on two ship ships,which is not needed.lets compare it to other missile ships which can shoot at sniper range namely the cerberus and the cruise raven(it is completly useless ship imho, my alli kick out ppl who flies one during our ops). missiles at long range are barly usable at snipe range because their delay dmg ,but cerberus missiles have only 22 sec fligh time so that is the max delay ,and the phoenix has 132sec ,makes it completly useless at any capital fight at mid or long range. oh and you wont shoot pos on long range. so this weapon system is useless at med and long range,it is a short range weapon system with less dmg than the short range guns.therefor the phoenix needs its torps the close range weapon system to be boosted and a new long range weapon system , and as caldari tend to use rails for long range why not give the phoenix rails? with 3 turret slots and +10% optimal/lvl +5% dmg/lvl only to rails ,it could be a very fine dread at snipe range. and with the current 3 missile slots and bonuses + a little dmg boost for the torps and lower torps flight time could do nice dmg at close range. i think 60km optimal would be enough for torps. and current citadel torpedo stats makes it worthless shooting at target which moves, even if that is only 5mps. it is speed tanking speed.... the moros and revelation are fine dreads , after this change only the naglfar would need a boost."
12/7/2008,"first, dreads are designed for shooting big immobile targets (control towers and other sieged dreads) so most of the time you shouldn't be shooting at things that can speed tank you anyway. if anything needs to be done it would be to replace the kinetic damage bonus with a universal damage bonus - currently the supposed advantage of missile users being able to choose their damage type is negated because you lose one of your hull bonuses by switching away from kinetic torps."
12/7/2008,"second every turret dreads can shoot carriers welll even some can shoot bses in some situations. so why couldnt do citadel torp do the same?third if citadel torp is only good for shooting huge stationary targets and turrets are good for against carriers, then why not citadel torpedo is the best pos shooter? i mean best is to be able to do dmg as a turret dread +20-25% against a pos."
12/7/2008,"i can't fly capitals, and i haven't put a single point into missiles since character creation. i say they should have the highest dps because they have the least flexibility - you have missile waiting times, and you don't have the obscene moros drone bonus. here's the current dps of all-5 dreads, with highest-damage t1 ammo, 2 damage mods and 5 ogre ii, range in brackets:moros short: 5648(7.5+25)moros long: 4046(60+60)revelation short: 4467(25+20)revelation long: 3948(50+40)naglfar short: 4354(missiles 152, turrets 5+40)naglfar long: 3426(missiles 152, turrets 40+88)phoenix: 3909 (152)at range, the phoenix is respectable, and it's pretty good once you get up over 100 km or so, assuming you don't care about flight time. but it just doesn't compare at low ranges, which is a pretty gaping hole. the obvious solution here is to rename citadel torps to citadel cruises, and create a real line of capital torpedoes. this would eliminate most of my complaints about flexibility, and allow dps to be modified for long and short independently. but at present, they have poor flexibility and poor dps at most engagement ranges. they certainly need something."
12/7/2008,"the ability to determine your damage type is incredibly flexible. and not needing to switch between short and long range ammunition, ever. they also have an excellent burst tank."
12/7/2008,"the implication im picking up from some of these posts is ""hey.. it doesnt do alot of dps, but it has a mean tank"" in other words.. ""phoenix makes a great capital bait ship."""
12/7/2008,there is no such as capital bait ship... and who would be able to fly only a stupid bait ship anyway? ppl train dreads to use them in capital fights and pos shooting not as a bait ship. so phoenix needs a boost to be able to particibate well in capital fight too.
12/7/2008,"where did you get 'it doesn't do a lot of dps'? it does roughly the same dps as long-range fits of every other dread, can pick its damage type, and doesn't need to switch weapons or ammunition to dictate range. in other words it is balanced. there are differences between capital weapons and capital tanking strategies. differences are what make things interesting. if you don't like the way the phoenix operates, there's three other dreads to choose from."
12/7/2008,"it is balanced because it doenst need to change ammo due to range . so it is balanced because it doenst need a max 12 sec ammo change,every time when distance to target changes. it is balanced because siege dreads and their targets distance changes so fast that this 10 sec ammo change makes them very useless in most situations. so it is balanced because you say so..."
12/7/2008,"you understand that a sieged nag/moros/rev will often miss the moving carrier (and pretty much completely miss moving battleships) while the phoenix will always get damage on target, even if it is diminished.add in the same statement that always crops up in turrets vs missiles. while turrets can crit, they can also glance, while missiles do uniform damage.and whoever made that proposal about adding turret hard-points so the phoenix can be hybrid fit or torp fit, i like that. it would give rohk (thus hybrid) specialized pilots something to work with."
12/7/2008,"three other dreads have to reload ammunition. and every other dread has to switch ammo if distance changes drastically. what's your point?if you think that capital engagements can't change distance quickly, look up what happened in esoteria a few months ago when atlas brought short range dreads and goons brought long range dreads."
12/7/2008,it was a pretty fun fight.
12/7/2008,"it is between long and short range guns,but if you fit long range guns then you most of the time only need to use one type of ammo which you load in before you jump in. and torps are useless at long range. and no distance doenst change rapidly in capital fights."
12/7/2008,"the vapor seathe vapor sea is the area between providence-catch and querius.storyline:a recent breakthrough from *insert pirate scientist faction/corp* has made it possible to build stargates to these starsystems.region:1. the region is npc 0.0 space.2. it has to be explored first; discover the deadspace signature for the position to build the stargate. which builds similar to that of outposts.3. the natural rats in the region is eom(they are amarr ships who use hybrids and shield tanks.)4. no cyno fields can be sprung; aka no capitals allowed. this is due to the same purposes as the pic at top give :)5. pos cost significantly more to run. this is due to the amount of radiation that bombards the pos.6. true sec of the area is similar to that of syndicate or providence. 0.0 to about -0.3addition to the game:ability to dynamically find and create stargates at great expense... which remain hidden and potentially could be used by the ruling faction of player run 0.0sovereignty 1 is required in the system to control and restrict who may use the gate. otherwise anyone can use it, if they know where it is."
12/7/2008,the fun part of this is that it makes 0.0 similar to that of high sec. the area since it inhibits cynos means logistics of the deep parts of the region will be more difficult. moving around will also be much more difficult as the stargates wont necessarily be visible.
12/7/2008,"so once you get sov 1 on the entry gates [or entry systems] you can sit there and lock everyone out, allowing you and only you access to whatever resources lie therein with pretty much no way for anyone to contest it since they can't use the gates, and they can't cyno in capitals to contest your death stars...this is a terrible terrible terrible idea."
12/7/2008,"agreed, your idea had promise until you got to the locking gates part, i can see such a mechanic abused badly. making 0.0 similar to high sec defeats the premise of what 0.0 is for in the first place. still it would be cool to have a region or two in 0.0 like it was in the old days before dictor/hic bubbles, capitals, and pos spaming."
12/7/2008,the new region will be npc 0.0 so the stargates will be wide open for all to use... whoever can find and bm them.the player 0.0 area you can lockdown... but there are still normal stargates in place granting people access.the main purpose of the stargates in player 0.0 would be to allow jumps to systems that dont exist. essentially making the trip shorter. or jumps out of your space into another system which is a chokepoint jump.
12/7/2008,pos spamming will essentially be limited by the fact it's npc 0.0 and the increased cost of the pos.the bubbles i think should stay.
12/7/2008,"wait, so in one post you say the stargates are free for all to use, but next you say player factions which gain sov1 can stop people using the stargates? its pretty hard to comment on your idea when you're contradicting yourself within the same thread."
12/7/2008,also the image you linked to clearly states that there won't be any stars or planets in the region in question until millions of years in the future. are you really proposing a whole region with no celestial features? these poss you talk about ... what are we supposed to anchor them at? how do we gain sov1 over a star system ... when there are no stars and no star systems?
12/7/2008,"as it is now caod is completly useless and only good for some little brain dead kids to express their stupid flaming and whining skills to the community. most of the topics are for flame wars many are duplicate and most posts are pointless and complet waste of time to read,yeah nobody should read caod who has a little sense ,but thats why i would like it to change.i would like to see much more constructive post in that channel. i think it could be done it the following way. ceo-s could set up for alli or corp that only ceo and or directors could post on caod forum. minimal member for corps to be able to post on caod , not much like 10 would be sufficient. this is needed to remove those stupid alt posters ,which makes most of the useless topics. and corps with less than 10 ppl are not that important to need posting on caod.or a posting fee on caod forum, would make those one liners extinct :p"
12/7/2008,i actually support caod being awful. it keeps the idiots out of the real forums.
12/7/2008,"fixed for ya, but yes i agree with your sentiment herschel."
12/7/2008,"hi.i have a solution which doesn't require developer time and resources.don't read caod.alternatively, most thread titles usually have some bearing on the subject matter (those that do not are frequently locked). so instead of blindly clicking links, read a little.hope this helps."
12/7/2008,"have you ever actually tried to camp a gate in lowsec?if you have two equal fleets fighting at a gate, the gate that was camping gets the 'home court advantage' with positioning and such. the fleet that jumps in and gets aggressed gets a very helpful dps boost. the winner, is likely the fleet with the better fc or the fleet that doesn't get lagged.that is if the fleet is jumping in, one is camp and the other is warping to the gate it's the one that shoots first that is at the disadvantage.but i guess that anyone who shoots your beloved ship should burn.have you tried to catch one of the cloaky haulers?it damn near takes a frigate to lock the things! oh, guess what he was the first to aggress, he gets to buy a new ship. and that is if the damn thing isn't on the opposite side of the huge gate, and if the pilot of the hauler is a moron and doesn't cloak or warp after the frig dies before the battleships lock him anyway.anyone who loses a ship in lowsec (who isn't pvping in lowsec) is a moron.oh well, maybe we should just rename this pvp thing ""mutual dueling, in an 'arena', where we don't actually lose our ships, can't get pod killed"", and everyone is friends."
12/7/2008,af's and t1 cruisers shouldnt be able to solo tank gate guns. i remember a time when you used to have like 3 seconds to get out before your cruiser got popped. now it's not uncommon for ruptures and raxs to go out and solo gates. doesnt seem quite right..
12/7/2008,sentries are powerful enough if you boost them what about the small ships that help in camps they will be insta poped and then we will have more of our lovly solo pvp is dead (which it is) :d
12/7/2008,we want to boost low sec for solo pvp as it is meant to go like this0.0 = blob massive warefair fightslow sec = solo/small gang camps/roamshigh sec = carebear village with a little bit of pvp at lower security systemsatm its like this0.0 = massive blobs everywere low sec = big blobs everywerehigh sec = gankers everywerenot ballanced at all are they?
12/7/2008,"another way to discourage pvp, what a brilliant idea =\sentries already force low sec pvp to generally be the domain of bc/bs. for a place that should be fostering newer players beginning pvp forcing everyone into rr bs's is a horrible direction to go in.all you would be doing is hurting the small gangs/newer players and forcing camps to grow in size to spread the sentry damage, which is already rather significant. you will not hurt large bs/rr gate camps, the dps needed to force them off the gate would be ridiculous.it's low sec, it's meant to be a place where you are not safe. if you use your head and teamwork it is perfectly safe as it stands already.high sec is that way -->"
12/7/2008,"yeah, this is the problem with sentry guns, not that they don't do enough dps. they act as a straightjacket which force anyone who gatecamps in lowsec to leave their smaller light ships behind and fit remote rep battleships.what if lowsec sentry guns had more varied setups (ie some gates with large guns and terrible tracking, some with small precision guns, some with e-war batteries, some with a mix of the above)? that would at least mean people would be using more than a couple of different ship classes."
12/7/2008,"bad idea. gate guns will kill frigate class ships in seconds, so no interceptors/bombers/af's will pirate at gates. cruisers stand a little longer but not that long. bcs can face the guns for quite a while but when fighting its even more dps for them to handle, and bss, yes they can tank the guns, but as above, having the gate guns on your side in a fight, makes a big difference. leave them alone.only carebears who fear pirates want this surely, well guess what, lowsec has pirates. deal with it."
12/7/2008,"just ban the twit, period. don't allow him to change his name unless it's the generic 'citizen ######'if i can't change mine, this nitwit should not have the luxury... he should just flat out be banned, the entire account."
12/7/2008,"well, ok. if you insist. in order of appearance:refuted by yourself, below.also, declaring the war the day the csm results were released is... what? votes being the issue was first raised by you, here:and then passed off as being something we said, again by you, here:is below this supposed to be a flame? regardless, it is a lie as we have not jumped ship.the only thing broken about the wardec system is that a large alliance (such as yourself) suffers virtually no repercussions for deccing a much smaller group (such as us). you pay an easily affordable sum to do whatever you want.is this a flame? how about you back up your statements? declan hasn't shed tears in this forum, unless you have proof otherwise?"
12/7/2008,"you realize, as a 0.0 entity, we don't take wardecs that serious?you, however, seem up in arms over the loss of what, only 8 ships? the wardec had absolutely nothing to do with the csm, insofar as votes are concerned, and more to do with the terrible posting of issler (and the name of the alliance)."
12/7/2008,good pr is everything!
12/7/2008,so what's the actual agenda for the csm ii meeting 2?
12/7/2008,"did this meeting take place? if so, are there likely to be meeting logs posted anytime soon?agenda looks a little slim!arithron"
12/7/2008,? dude you is funny!... i think war dec's cost way too much... but from what i see.. if we war dec viziam you will be the 1st i use my locator agent to find and pod you..lolbut the way i look at it. if you in a corp that get war dec'd leave the corp.. pretty simple if u ask me.
12/7/2008,"you can't wardec viziam.it's one of those ""get out of eve free"" corps."
12/8/2008,you have me convinced.
12/8/2008,change your character's name! support this cause!
12/8/2008,"everyone changes their name to ""0100101101001010111101"" or to start some letter in the middle of the alphabet to avoid being called primary."
12/8/2008,"on the character trade side:if i buy a character, the old character simply does not exist anymore. in fact you should not even get to keep the old name at all. you don't buy a character for its history in the game. if you did, it would be a sort of scam in itself as you are not the same person. so when you buy a char, you should get to name it and create its portrait as if it was a new character.so on this side, full support.on the game sidethis is indeed a bit trickier, i don't really want to change my name as the history connected to it would disappear pretty much. you can not allow this, even with a fee, without some players abusing the system. if a comity could review character renaming requests it would be a bit easier to weed out unlegitimate requests, but even then it would not be perfect.then again, personally i don't care. if someone i don't like suddenly changes his character's name, chances are i won't like him under his new name either. so supported, but under the condition that more thought is put into the mechanics."
12/8/2008,if that's the immersion you strive for playing eve i pity you.that being said i'm all for numbers being disallowed in names outright.people would just call targets using other means than rambling numbers and you'll sit there looking like a scared little idiot for going so far as to cower behind a nonsense 'name'.
12/8/2008,hack and salvage is a great idea
12/8/2008,i support more and more games are duel moniter support it be good to move the on sceen windows to anouther window leaving the main window clear
12/8/2008,"hopefully the new csm picks this up. yes ccp may say we decided missiles will suck, deal with it, or hey maybe we did overtweak the numbers abit. either way this needs to be brought to ccp's attention, since its been proven they dont play the game.so im asking the new csm, please bring this forward"

12/8/2008,i support this idea.
12/8/2008,this is being implemented into the walk in station feacher in the next expantion on march 10th
12/8/2008,"how exactly is this anti-immersive? the concept that you have to be in the same physical place with somebody to have a face-to-face meeting with them is already becoming a thing of the past. webcam conference calls, virtual meeting rooms, 3d spatialised sound systems... even the projection technology that you're talking about implementing in game almost exists right now, it's certainly less than a decade away. and this is in 2008, eve is set tens of thousands of years from now. if anything the inability to have anything but text-based interaction with someone distant is a serious immersion breaker. this won't be a simple implementation - new ambulation content will have to be added, ""holoprojector booths"" that you can walk up to and project across the cluster, in addition to new shaders for the ""hologram"" effect. those aren't that tricky. the problem is whether the eve architecture can actually support you being in the ambulation node of station b while your pod is located in station a. i imagine there would be a number of tricky distinctions for which support may not exist. still, it's awesome and should definitely exist, i'd like to see the idea put forward."
12/8/2008,"done right, this would enable socialising without real interaction (e.g. buying things) for a fee, a eve-style long-distance telephone call if you will.given that this is exactly how current 'bars' work, and that real station services will be hard to find (16 slots per station, no way to advertise that your specific bar is in system x, station 5-5, moon b) i actually see ambulation as being very very dull in quiet stations without this sort of service.then again i argued the same in the original thread, so no real surprises there."

12/8/2008,"a falcon should not be able to perma jam a domi with a best named eccm and a backup fitted. /supported, boost eccm!yes it should, thats what falcons are for. ecm and falcons are not broke."
12/8/2008,"falcon dps really is a bit anemic, but its base ehp is actually slightly higher than that of a rapier or an arazu. if falcon pilots decide not to fit any kind of tank or buffer in exchange for more jammers it's their decision, not part of the ship's limitations.drop jamming range closer to the other recons and you would probably see more tank and mwd on falcons."
12/8/2008,i support thisthe amount of falcons and rooks that fly around in low sec recently is just sillythere are even fleets that are made up by 25-50% of ecm ships only
12/8/2008,"ccp has stated time and again that they want small achievable goals in 0.0 that allows the environment and the people living in it to thrive. yet with the introduction of pos some years ago, and later station services and sovereignty, they have really stepped away from what made 0.0 so much fun. while theyve attempted to make land holding a bit more sustainable, they have in fact encouraged greater amounts of blob warfare and power blocks. now 0.0 holds 3 main blocks, with several smaller ones arising now and again. common fleet engagements are not measured in double digits any longer, instead, were approaching 1000 or more involved in 1 system. i think a large share of the blame for 0.0s problems are pos warfare, but there are other issues striking me too. but lets begin with the largest burden.ccp has acknowledged that there is a problem with pos warfare, but hasnt really said what is wrong. this really concerns me because it may lead us to a fix that will ultimately fix the wrong parts of the problem rather than address the actual issues. so im going to attempt to break down where the problems are and what needs to be addressed. furthermore, im going to start inserting real numbers, which a lot of the arguments have been missing lately, and which ccp so greatly desires to have.beyond any of the problems below, whats important to understand is that pos warfare is a grind. its not even a good kind of grind, its mind numbing and boring whether youre the attacker or the ones being attacked. yet this is the primary infrastructure of 0.0 space. you want people to live in 0.0 because its the wild wild west. but instead you make them experience the building of the pyramids, as one of the workers? thrilling.before the real rant and fixes start, lets take a look at the problems of pos and pos warfare.weapon disparitythere are 2 main towers used in 0.0, minmatar and amarr. i wont deal with the other 2 towers because simply put, they arent used on a large scale, and thats a different issue to look at as to why."
12/8/2008,"lets take a look at some numbersdisclosure:faction guns do 50% more damage per 1 power grid than standard guns. however for consistency and later arguments, ill display the numbers here. tracking and ranges remain constant.medium dark blood pulse battery:tracking: 0.02547optimal: 118.5 (amarr tower 79 base *1.5mod)optimal with multifrequency: 59.25effective hp: 1.6milliondps: 402medium dark blood beam battery:tracking: 0.00436optimal: 420 (amarr tower 280 base *1.5mod)optimal with multifrequency: 210effective hp: 1.6milliondps: 256apoc with 7 tachyon 2s:heat sink iitracking enhancer iiheat sink iiheat sink ii1600mm reinforced steel plates iidamage control iireactor control unit iisensor booster ii, targeting rangesensor booster ii100mn microwarpdrive iisensor booster ii, targeting rangetachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora ltachyon beam laser ii, aurora l[empty high slot]tracking .00596 t2 ammotracking .02385 t1 ammooptimal: 188km t2 rangeoptimal: 52km multieffective hp: 63,453dps: 351dps: 595 apoc tends to be the highest turret based damage bs based on common setups used in fleets at 190km (ish) ranges, other bs tend to loose about 12% damage and/or lose out on range for other tradeoffs (ie capacitor, alpha, tracking)now lets take a look at a base tower, again standard weaponry loses about 33% damage per 1pg to faction, but faction is becoming more common (its not often destroyed after a tower kill and is scooped to be re-anchored later) and serves a greater purpose for this thread.this tower puts all powergrid to use for guns. it has no hardeners, no scramblers and no jammers, this is strictly for base comparison. 39 and 27 are the maximum amount of either gun that could be online on a tower if no other modules were present. this amount of beams and pulse are independent of each other."

12/8/2008,"now excluding a random day where a small 40 man fleet can get on a tower and not get harassed by defending fleets, capital ships, titans, pos gunners, swarms of dictors and bubbles, and whatever else we can throw at them, how does this cater to small scale warfare.cyno jammersoriginally when these were in concept stage, i always thought, cool, we can defend high value systems in our home space better. we can build capitals, and fortify our alamo. but who knew that the only real requirements would be holding space for 5 weeks to gain a stiff advantage over others.cyno jammers have 3 main flaws.1. jump bridge arrays work in cyno jammed systems. so basically what youre telling me is, weve blockaded the enemy town or fortress, aiming to bleed them dry, but they decided to invent helicopters to airlift in archers, cannons, support, moons, and whatever else defies physics while we cant even ride on the back of an eagle to get over the walls b/c our fat asses crushed its back.jump bridges should not be allowed in a system at the same time as a cyno jammer is active. its just silly. you put your troops in the fortress and expect them to defend until death. gates into systems are the only back doors needed if a cyno jammer is up.not only are bridges in jammed systems a terrible idea, the fact that they too can be defended insainly well makes it way way to easy to get friends into system to defend. add to that titan dooms days and carrier swarms and any system within 2 jumps will be virtually impossible to take down. sure surprise works on occasion, but even that has issues as its very limited in use.2. hit points and guns. weve already seen how well a cyno jammer tower is defended by guns if you add a few dictors into the mix, pop pop, there goes a lot of fleet ships. add in a friendly fleet, and well, you have to be the biggest gits in the world to lose a cyno jammer. add in just a couple carriers or moms repping the jammer and forget it.3. fuel. how is it that these all powerful jammers dont require massive ammouts of fuel to operate. essentially they act like a shield, yet they require virtually no investment cost. they can also be shot down quickly by pos guns after being incapped, allowing for placement of a new jammer very short time no repping ever required. seems kinda fishy that i can just choose to destroy and replace without much cost.station services:this is quick and easy to explain. stations have 5 main services that can be offlined. the lower hp services have around 50,000,000 hit points. so if i bring in a small 50 man battleship fleet set for close range high damage t2 ammo and cap stability, each with around 1000 dps (a pipe dream and a 1 trick pony), it takes me 16.6 minutes for 1 station service or 83 minutes for all 5 services assuming i have enough ammo and am not interrupted. how does that cater to small fleet warfare, or face pace gaming? have you ever shot station services, its mind numbing and boring, its why we bring everything and the kitchen sink to take em down. does it suck to lose services, yes, but then thats a reason to have smaller borders and defend less space better. so doesnt that fit in with the theme were getting at?possible fixesok, so far 2 major problems addressed, but how do we fix this? for starters, pos weaponry should not be superior to substantial fleets in so many ways. i would like to see a reduction in hp of all pos guns by 50-90%, bringing them much closer in line with the ships they counter. pos guns should also all receive 100% increase in sig radius making them easier to hit with with their corresponding ship classes. pos weaponry is ment as a deterrent and a hindrance to hold up enemies until you can mount a counter, yet all too often, they are the primary defense of a system. if you want people fighting, make them less reliant on pos guns, force them out to fight more.cyno jammers need to be changed in many ways. for one, cyno jammers should require fuel in their own bays to operate over time. there needs to be a special tower designed to reduce fuel cost drastically for the trade off of less defense. standard towers should bleed through about 200 mil worth of fuel a day, and a bay should hold about 2 days worth of fuel. this will reduce the inclination to constantly shoot down the jammers and replace them as fuel cost would rise. it would still provide a heavily fortified cyno jammer but at much higher cost more for emergencies than standard practice."
12/8/2008,"cyno jammer towers should allow for very limited powergrid, maybe 1.5 to 2 million range and no buffs to gun damage or range. instead, offer defensive options such as eccm bonuses and a standard 90% reduction in fuel consumption. jammers could then be fueled every 20 days and cost about 20 mil a day per system on these towers.i also want to restate that jump bridges should not be usable in cyno jammed systems this will prevent roaming capital blobs in home territory that cannot be countered with standard fleets. at least not easily depending on how dumb the defenders are.because the cyno jammers need such a heavy nerf, i think it's time for a new ship class, similar in use to a heavy interdictor. the ship would be capable of launching a cyno jamming bubble to prevent direct capital hot drops in a 1 au radius area while burning considerable fuel. durations would last 1 minute and the ship would not be able to warp while the jammer is activated. the main focus of this ship is to gaurd against direct capital hot drops due to the weakened state of towers guns. the idea is to add more road blocks to carrier hot dropping rates while providing small defenses to capital fleets. specifics of the ship need to be worked out, probably frigate, hauler, or destroyer class for easy popping, but the concept i've always liked.bare in mind if you can't directly drop on an enemy fleet, it allows dictors and support fleets to slow down enemy capitals slightly.... this means fleets have to remove enemy cyno jamming ships first before capitals could jump directly onto the field.station services need a drastic cut in hit points. sure someone can hit your services fast, but at the same time, you can rep them fast too. no station service should have over 10 million hit points. this would give more reason for people to shoot them in an effort to draw out fights. it also would speed up the game considerably. if people dont want to be harassed so easily, then maybe theyll have to take less space which allows for easier defense. i think smaller blocks of territory would lead to less alliance on alliance love fest and create more disputes. making people easier to attack fast gives less reason to have allies 40 jumps away, b/c they just cant respond in time.implementing these changes would give smaller groups more opportunities, prevent silly and stupid cyno jammed dooms day, carrier swarming bottlenecks and open up 0.0 to much more diversity and tactics. its no longer time to say theres a problem; now its time to do something about the problems at hand. allow for more small scale harassment and every alliance will be forced to suffer a lot of inconveniences or consider their own interest more often rather than others."

12/8/2008,"currently you get a small green checkmark that tells you fleet bonuses are active, but there is no way to find out what is actually getting boosted. of course you can ask the gang leader what skills / modules he has, but that is far from practical.i would propose to add a list (accessible by right-clicking the fleet bonuses icon for example) that shows what bonuses are in effect. for example:- 9% mining lasers range (mining foreman link gang module)- 10% mining yield (mining foreman skill level 5)- 6% ship agility (skirmish warfare skill level 3)- 15% armor hitpoints (armored warfare mindlink implant)imagine adding implants, gang modules and ship specific bonuses (orca for ex.) to the mix, and very quickly you do not know how much bonuses you really give your fleet anymore."

12/8/2008,i would like to see this as well.
12/8/2008,i don't honestly see why this isn't in the game already.
12/8/2008,"to be honeste im in a small corperation that does not want to pvp and we got challenge by another corperation that thinks its fun to wage war aginst us, so we cant do what we want for fun ( doing missions ) becouse we have to be in a war we dont want to be in, we got a mail that stated that in 24 hours we would be in war with the other corperation by concord, to be honest i never liked pvp and never want to do pvp , so why does the game developers make it so easy for another corperation to wage war aginst us in a 0.6 -> 1.0 zone , wheb we clearly dont want this war, fix it so both corperations has to accept the war challenge or loose players and money becose of it.very unhappy player !"
12/8/2008,deal with it.
12/8/2008,"i am ! why dod you think i complain about here ?its bullsh.. that other corperations can force people to pvp, i thout pvp was made to be in low sec and not in 0.6 - > 1.0 zones , so fix the bug!"

12/8/2008,"if this is your problem with eve, then eve is the wrong game for you.eve is totally about pvp, either in the market or with ship pew pew, this game is all about pvp.you give up the right to consensual pvp the moment you log in. i tell you this, and i am a carebear."
12/8/2008,you thout wrong.
12/8/2008,honestly it sounds like you smack talked someone.your not even posting in your main.and while everyone else in this thread are acting like trolls.they are right.... this is normal. it's very easy to grief in war-decing.and most people in this game refuse to even remotely accept that fact.they just excuse it as... well what you just saw.but it dosen't help when your not posting with your main account.thats for sure.feel free to evemail me and i can offer some suggestions.
12/8/2008,"eve online is ab out competing corporations. maybe the corp that war decced you flew around your home system and said hey these carebears never leave here and we want it, so we're kicking them out.deal with it. learn to pvp."
12/8/2008,"if you want to avoid this non consensual war, you can either corp hop, i.e. go to another corporation or leave your current corporation for an npc corporation, which will give you complete protection from wars in general."
12/8/2008,"there's an old eve maxim that clicking the ""undock"" button implies consent for pvp, and it's as true today as it's ever been. one of the great things about this game is that it expects you to take care of yourself, instead of doing it for you, and sometimes that includes getting the snot beaten out of you by other people. fight them, hire mercs, corp-hop, or stay docked if there are any baddies in local. it can suck, but that's part of the game. even if you don't like it, it's hardly a ""bug""."
12/8/2008,"war deccing isn't griefing, quit trolling."
12/8/2008,"i sympathize with you, as wardecs have been admitted as a 'pay-to-grief' system usually. however, it's one of the disadvantages of being in a player corporation.being in a player corporation does have a lot of advantages over the npc corps though. you have a much better fleet system than npc corps do (we don't even share aggro), and you can put up poses. those are major benefits that npc players will never achieve unless they join a player corporation.while i disagree that this game is centered around pvp (as 99% of the items used in pvp are only available from players), it does have a strong pvp background. that background, however painful, is necessary for the economy to keep operating the way it is.tl;dr: learn your situation, and make the most of it."
12/8/2008,"i see no bug, exploit, or griefing here."
12/8/2008,"as we all know items acumulate over time.well if we go ingame, check our assets tab on the left hand side of the screen. then, go to the station tab on your assets window. below you will see sub tabs which include the following.- ships - modules - charges - minerals - others -thats great and all, for everything you ahve with in that station, but what about everything in which you have all over the universe. thats when i created this little picture below.imagin now, if you will, how easy it would be to find say, ships you have scatterd around, or perhaps minerls, or other.... etc etc etc.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.in other words, why are these sub tabs only avaliable in the ""station"" tab, not ""all items""!!!"
12/8/2008,"yeada. tick please, ktnxbai!?"
12/8/2008,"the assets window needs a lot of work. this is one good suggestion, but i'd add at least one other to it - you should be able to look inside containers remotely(use the standard interface where it starts minimized and you get a little + beside it to expand). on top of that, we need way better sorting and searching functions. there are lag concerns about some of these, and i'm sympathetic to that, but i'd like to see more functionality from this window, and i'm sure that at least some of it can be achieved without undue server stress."
12/8/2008,i fully support this i would love to have a second screen dedicated to my on sceen windows it would let me play eaisier and wont be as cluttered
12/8/2008,"very, very, very, bad ideaeve has always been about consequences. the only way i'd support this if eve had a sec-standing system between people and corps in addition to concord. once your sec status drops low enough with my corp, we get to shoot you with impunity until you bribe us to stop."

12/8/2008,i would love to see my shiny ship more times than one. this would also add a lot of re(watchability?) if you could change the paintschemes on your ships and add corporation logos. then you could show off the brand new ship with a brand new paintjob. maybe to save on lag you could have a friend invite you to his hanger where you will go to his and it will load to an instance where it is just you and say some npc mechanics walking around and some ship loaders and stuff. plus i would love to dock in to station and then see my ship there everytime i would stop and stare at it and go ooooohhhh aaaaahhhhhhh.
12/8/2008,"yep, that's what ccp said during fanfest 2008. they saw it as a poor allocation of development time that could be used to enrich more frequently used parts of the game (like the wis part, as opposed to widb)"
12/8/2008,"background:commanding a gang competently is almost an art-form. not everyone can be an fc; it requires perception, rapid planning and good communication skills. good quality information transfer is an essential part of decision making, and this is one of several areas where the ui has room for improvement. this is the first half of this proposal, detailing small-scale changes which i will submit as a separate issue. the second half will be submitted later and detail larger scale issues.problem: 1. many aspects of the current gang interface are unnecessarily difficult to work with 2. both new and experienced fleet commanders could greatly benefit from ui tweaksproposal:1. improve the watchlist: include shiptypes to help prioritise/direct remote-repairing and inform the fc of what has been lost/remains, which is particularly helpful for small gangs2. allow fleet/wing/squad commanders to have a differently coloured text. this helps distinguish their orders from other fleet chatter. in combat situations this is essential.edit: will clarify re: 'fixed' command positions vs those commanding 'in practice'3. create a 'merge fleet' option to automate the unifying of different gangs. this saves a lot of headaches involved in having to re-invite every single pilot into the receiving fleet.4. standing orders: enable fleet standing orders in a similar way to an motd, which helps reduce the need to repeat orders if you are reconnecting / joining late"
12/8/2008,good stuff.
12/8/2008,/signed
12/8/2008,"very very useful changes.edit: might also want to look into multiple watchlists/expanding the number of people you can watch at one time.broadcasts from squad/wing/fleet coms repeated in fleet chat would also be nice, as would the ability to have a ""repair xxx"" command easily accessable."
12/8/2008,"this is good stuff.edit: just thought of an addition - it'd be good for everybody, but also quite useful for fcs. how about a ""class"" column on the overview? sort by that, and all of a sudden you see carriers or logistics all in one group instead of in four separate ones by ship name."
12/8/2008,"i would like it where the fc could click on a target and see a type of menu that would allow him to order a squad or flight to attack that target. this would transmit to all players in that flight showing that target with say a big target reticle hovering over him letting you know that you all need to attack him. this would make it easier and take lees time for th efc than trying to talk to the squad on the mic saying i want you all to attack (name here). also could allow prioritizing targets so a number would be on them so you attack target(hostile) 1 and when his ship is destroyed the number two would now become number one and so on. something else to help the fc would be a 2d or 3d map showing the action wihtin a certain radius, this could be limited to a certain type of command ship. it would show up sort of like a uav would show you all the targets so you could get a noncluttered version of the map with a radar showing all the targets with their ships and possibly allowing for a ship scanners on the ship so you can get better intel on them. sorry i added so much but your proposal sparked a light bulb in me"

12/8/2008,"ninja salvager pose an interesting challenge imo. like the op, i mission in a crowded system because there are many good agents there. i have had the occasional ninja salvagers, and they are hard to defend against as they don't take any loot. they use fast, expendable ships and dash from one wreck to the next just salvaging them. no agression timer, you can't do anything to them without a concord intervention.in that situation, you can't just go back to base to fetch your salvaging boat afer the mission is done. they will follow you anywhere you go in the mission, and if they get aggro from the rats they are so fast that they simply fly out and come back in.the game mechanics won't be changed in the near future, so what can you do about them?1) take a dedicated salvager pilot along, or use an alt2) fit a salvager yourself and get the most important items3) shoot the wrecks, they will get the idea eventually4) move to another system5) wardec them and at least get the satisfaction of revenge (if they undock)if i missed anything, please shout."
12/8/2008,"hehe mission runner leechers ,cool :) i support everything which makes game harder /less profitable for high sec missioners.and gogo salvage those wrecks,who cares not you blown up the ship^^"
12/8/2008,i agree supporting this topic.... since the one place that they would benefit from the long warps currently... their capacitor is sucked dry trying to make that warp and negates it all.
12/8/2008,how about nerfing bigger ships instead??? decrease their warp acc. and decc. speed...
12/8/2008,would be nice to see the faster ships show a noticeable difference in warp.
12/8/2008,i will be happy with increasing warp acceleration on smaller ships as long as fleet warps have the entire fleet accelerate at the rate of the slowest accelerating ship. just like how a fleet warp now moves everybody at the warp velocity of the ship with the slowest warp velocity.maybe ccp could balance this by making all ships take a constant time from entering warp to reaching their max warp velocity.
12/8/2008,hmmm. i like it!
12/8/2008,"good idea, but the training times for them would be stupidly long.frigate, cruiser and bc lv5, why would you need those to fly a t2 bs, plus a few other skills on that list shouldnt be conpulsary or it would take less time to train for a capital ship, maby even a titan."
12/8/2008,"this would be a great idea for a newly defined titan role.eliminate the idea that they need to be huge ships that 1shot everything, and have them be fleet flagships instead.i don't like it for battleship class though. that sounds like more the role for an elite dreadnaught."
12/8/2008,"i have to assume that was a typo(replicated by cut and paste) on the op's part - bs 5 requires cruiser and frigate 4, not 5, and he wrote them as requisite trees rather than requisites proper."
12/8/2008,hey this is pretty well thought out and i like it. maybe add more med adn low slots instead of high slots to add to the durability.

12/8/2008,"i can see this being horribly abused by medium/large sized gangs, wcs were nerfed a few years ago because they are not meant to be fitted to combat ships (that want to fight, travel fits is another story).so instead of falcon alts, we should start roaming around with frigs/noob ship alts to give us remote wcs when we lose?no thanks."

12/8/2008,"such hostile responses. you'd think everyone had a back-up fleet everywhere they went that could fit said modules and boost them. but then again, maybe i'm the only one who didn't jump on the blob boat after the last patch."
12/8/2008,it's called pirates who dont like losing there profffiiiittssssss.
12/8/2008,it's called carebears who hate risk and want eve on easy modddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

12/8/2008,"no way doomsday devices are awesome, no way should they be taken out.just having a titan is ridiculous expensive, and losing one is ridiculous. the cost to actually use a ddd is ridiculous as well, so this is beyond the pale. leave ddd alone plz."
12/8/2008,the jump portal is so valuable that even if you took everything else away the titan would be worth it.
12/8/2008,"for an alliance's first, i agree fully. probably for the second and third too. but can you really get 50 billion's worth of use out of your 20th? if the answer is yes then i'll let it die, but i suspect it's no."
12/8/2008,even ccp has said time and time again that titans were never supposed to be cost effective in combat.
12/8/2008,"tech-2 logistics ships became great after the logistics buff.however, the buff didn't effect the tech 1 logistics cruisers, and they remain horribly inadequate.the actual proposal is at the bottom under the emboldened ""proposal"".tech 2 logistics ship advantages over their tech 1 counterparts: (aka my argument)they all either get bonuses to either armor or shield repping, not all tech 1 counterparts do.all get 50% better range at whatever they do.they all get 100% more armor/shield hp rep/boost out of their remote reppers/boosters, and do so 100% more efficiently (without even looking at base capacitor capacity and recharge!).after taking into consideration the disparity in base capacitor strength, where tech 2 logistics cruisers have a 38% stronger capacitor, the disparity in armor rep / shield boost efficiency is magnified by 38% on close average.to recap,tech 2 logistic's efficiency = 800% more efficient than an unbonused remote repping/boosting shiptech 1 logistic's efficiency = 200% more efficient than an unbonused remote repping/boosting shipbut because the tech 2 logistics have a 38% stronger base capacitor, the tech 2 logistics ships are actually 552% more efficient than tech 1 logistics cruisers, rather than just 400% as one might believe.then there is fitting. not only do tech 1 logistics cruisers get far less powergrid and/or cpu, but also lack the -65% power need for remote armor repair systems, -65% power need for remote armor repair systems, and -50% power need for energy transfer arrays role bonuses.this disparity allows tech 2 logistics cruisers to not only execute their 552% better efficiency at full capacity, but also have slots and grid to spare on respectable buffer tanks, or to boost their locking speed.oh yeah, locking speed!one thing about logistics that may be overlooked is that the role is reactive.additionally, tech 1 logistics have a pathetic amount of max targets (5), while their big brother's have 10.while the tech 1 logistics cruisers have a better scan resolution than their combat counterparts there is really no reason for there to be any difference in maximum targets or scan resolution between the tech 1 and tech 2 logistics cruisers, as the ability to quickly lock multiple targets is a basic essential to performing a reactive, combat role.proposal:-review the current potency of tech 1 logistics cruiser's ship bonuses and consider adding more, keeping in mind that their tech 2 counterparts are 400% more capacitor efficient, and 552% more potent at remote repping/boosting in reality due to the logistic's role bonus.-consider a role bonus for tech 1 logistics cruisers.-review the weak capacitor of the tech 1 logistics cruisers.-review the powergrid and cpu of tech 1 logistics cruisers.-review the scan resolution and maximum targets of tech 1 logistics cruisers."

12/8/2008,"to be honest, i don't think players really use the logistics cruisers for logistics per say, as they have a much more useful role in their primary bonus. the scythe and osprey are mining cruisers and the exequor makes a great salvage vessel (better than a destroyer). the augoror i'm not sure about, as i don't fly slaver tech.i don't really see a need to boost these ships any more than they already are. logistics cruisers should have the much better bonuses, as they also have a much reduced utility."
12/8/2008,"the current weapons with the different clip size will need some rebalace after this, but yes its a good idea. i support this."
12/8/2008,"with weapon grouping in, the math behind this request has changed a lot and makes the changes proposed unnecessary. reloading is still exponential, but 1^n = 1.the clippy vs clippiness of the different weapon systems is something that brings color into the game. i do not like issues which try to make everything the same, e.g., in this case, removing the need to reload for non-laser weapons. furthermore, i definitely do not support any kind of amarr nerf (by nerfing them or by boosting all the others) at this moment. they are the race with the least options about how to use their ships. there are only a few situations where amarrian ships are the best choice. now you wanna remove this small advantage they sometimes have? and before you ask: i fly the ships of every race except for the amarr."
12/8/2008,"although a interesting idea, why would doing this help ""fix"" anything? there is nothing broken about the system we use now.if you add ""ammo bays"" then the ship size has to change. the space has to come from somewhere. this would mean a larger ship or less cargo space. and that means being able to carry fewer ships in a transport / industrial / freighter or, changing there size. or the cargobay size of the ships have to be changed and we can carry less lootalso why cant we pilots do everything the op is talking about now? stacking ammo in the cargo bays is normal, and moveing around small ammo objects is something best done before the battle not during. i also dont see this huge amarrian ship advantage of crystals, because they have to change ammo too just like everyone else does. this means you simply have to bring enough ammo (stacked) to shoot with. the amarrian ships take ten seconds to change ammo just like everyone else.also i am not quite sure if the op means he likes ccp wranglers post or not, but personally i intensely dislike the idea of any fc being able to change my ammo at his whim. so, in my personal opinion: we need to stop fixing things that are not broken, this will in the end fix a lot of the lag. there will be more ccp programmers to work on the issues are really broken now. and of course i mean the issues that they fixed before, and then nerfed, and then fixed again........-rorin"
12/8/2008,correction; they're pretty much instant. i'd still argue that you pay for that advantage & lack of 'normal' ammo with cap usage and single damage type...
12/8/2008,magazine
12/8/2008,"i dont have any experience with large fleet battles but i do like the idea of an ammo bay, that makes total sense as someone else mentioned you put the ammo by your weapons not in your carg where you would have something go get it everytime you run out of ammo."
12/8/2008,"i don't scan roids myself(when i mine, i just point my lasers and go), but these all sound like good suggestions."
12/8/2008,"hello all,this idea has been around the block for some time, and i feel it's finally time for ccp to get the proposal and work on getting it implemented in the game. the concept is this: have npcs not drop t1 meta 0 loot anymore, as it has been a bane on the manufacturers and miners of eve for too long. while the concept has merit, i'm having trouble getting the exact mechanics worked out, and thus request your help.here are the options i have sorted through:* no t1 meta 0 loot, higher bounties - the npcs that you kill either in missions or out on the field no longer drop meta 0 loot, but have a slightly (maybe 5%) higher bounty to compensate. this will make up for the lack of minerals and/or goods, but will provide a larger isk faucet in the game.* no t1 meta 0 loot, higher chance of meta 1+ loot - the same as above, but there would instead be a small (maybe 10%) bonus to the chance of a ship dropping a named variant of the t1 modules. this would compensate as above, but would lower the value of named goods (some of which are already below meta 0 items).* no t1 meta 0 loot, but enhanced mission rewards and/or dog tags - my preferred idea, the missions would increase their payout by about 50% (since mission completion rewards are such a pittance in terms of total rewards), and belt rats would have a higher chance of dropping tags which could be used in the tag missions and lp rewards tables.it should be said that i already intend to increase the interest and market viability in mining (as demonstrated on my website), but i feel that this change is the most critical. expect me to deliver future concepts to the playerbase to get any input so i can revise the concept before presenting the ideas to the csm and finally to ccp."
12/8/2008,"sounds interesting, though i'd rather see pos's be replaced with large anchorable ships that fill the same role with structures being modules on the ship, so that the whole thing can be plucked up and moved, without the sanity destroying anchoring process that we have now. that would take them adding in the targeting of modules for that to work though."
12/8/2008,"it's not up to csm to decide what's worth ccp's effort, they just have to rise issues. even if certs are useless they must be fixed, some of them are plain ridicolous and need a deep re-examination."
12/8/2008,"the irony is, a year ago when certificates were probably first thought of, i remember reading advice from those who engaged in solo pvp in high-sec & low-sec to train hull upgrades, shield management, and mechanic all to level 5 for those occasions you'd find you won the fight by 2% structure.of course, since solo is apparently dead now and most posting here are no doubt involved in blob warfare, it doesn't seem to have occurred to anyone this might be where it came from.to put it in simple terms, more hitpoints = more tank. if i'm going to be 'elite' in tanking, a few more hitpoints in shields might just make a difference. of course, in the vast majority of cases it won't, but then individual skills are completely irrelevant in the vast majority of cases due to numbers & focus fire."
12/8/2008,tbh if u want to gamble play with people u know and just use isk as a stake theres many free poker sites
12/8/2008,"so assembly hall is the new general discussion?if ambulation has no gambling, then the whole expansion will be a 100% waste of time."
12/8/2008,"your eve assets are the property of ccp. you're not gambling since you can't win or lose any of your assets, you're winning or losing a number in ccp's database."
12/8/2008,"fyi, i've run missions for a .7 agent, and received a courier storyline that wanted me to go into lowsec. maybe that's true for that missions agent, but not the storylines."
12/8/2008,im sorry larger ships sutch as carriers and drednoughts and evin motherships and titans fill this role to make high sec version of a carrier would prevent ccps goal to get 6 month+ players to explore low sec and 0.0. i live in 0.0 and il tell u 1 thing its empty for instance look at ships destroyed in the last hour it should be more yellow and red in low sec and 0.0 not in high sec
12/8/2008,yes i do support this evin thou i am a pirate an liek campoing stations the new stargates were made bigger soo it is extreamly difficult to bubble them soo why not give stations more exit points i think this would be good as with the new walk in staion fuction you could chouse ure exit points
12/8/2008,"when we saw the war dec we expected a serious goon assault. the timing made it clear to us it was the csm election results that produced the war. we then learned the goons had ransomed other members of the csm in the previous council. so initially we took this very seriously. i also felt the pilots of eve should know what the goons were up as this to me seemed to be intended to affect my actions in the csm. so i started this thread.soon we saw that it was really just a nice opportunity for us to shoot some of them and most of our worries evaporated. so at the moment it is just pvp practice for us and not much of a concern. whatever it was or may become become it never will have an effect on my participation in the csm. also we never pay ransom to get out of a war.as to the negative comments about my postings, strange there weren't any direct comments from the goons in the many csm threads i posted in prior to the election. i would have enjoyed some intelligent opposition to my position to debate but very little was offered. i don't claim to have been given a mandate by my election but clearly enough folks felt i represent their views to get me on the council. i promise to try and live up to their acts of support.i remain commited to my previous positions despite this distraction. i hope i can effectively represent a large player base that so many of the large alliances seem to ignore.issler dainzeyour voice in space when you scream!"

12/8/2008,solitude is just fine as it is thank you.
12/8/2008,yep. working as intended.
12/8/2008,"greetings,there are several proposals i'm working on at the moment, and i would invite people interested in the areas in question to provide their input prior to them being posted. your ideas/input need to focus on one of these four areas:- piracy- trading/markets- factional warfare- fleet warfare (though this particular one is complete and going up soon)please contact me via evemail if you would like send me your ideas/input or to review the drafts for constructive criticism."
12/8/2008,"piracyi'm all for the spirit of piracy, the all-or-nothing risk factor turns most people away. including me. i don't know about others, but when i'm mission running or doing exploration, im not fit for a competitive pvp fight.gate guns seem asinine to me. ok low sec, we encourage pirating, but only in battleships or tech 2 cruisers or larger.i dont know, but if there were a way for piracy to take some of your stuff without incurring sec status hit or necessarily taking everything from the victim i think it'd be a lot more successful for everyone. more people participating cause of the lower risk, more people pirating because of the no sec status hit.on the flip side i wish anti-pirating player-policing were supported by ccp. when a pirate commits a crime, there is a very short time to exact revenge before doing so is considered a crime.so they can yarr you and if you want revenge you have to yarr them right back, which then makes you a pirate.i don't have any simple suggestions. the whole security status and kill-rights systems are stupid ideas. the whole concept of lowsec seems asinine like they were for it in the first half of the meeting, then changed their mind halfway through.and the all-or-nothing risk of going to lowsec for mission running, mining, or exploring makes it extremely unpopular. the same all-or-nothing nature of yarring in 0.0 also results in all-or-nothing pirates, or rather, all-in-no-ransom-oh-and-im-gonna-pod-you pirates.i would support them completely redoing all of it. basically every facet involved in piracy sucks.p.s.my longwinded idea about piracy as a supported activity:a module that allows you to board a ship at 1/3 hull hp and take whatever you want off it. afterwards your victim gets a free instant warp.pirates get more stuff and no sec penalty, victims keep their ship, riggings, pod, and implants."
12/8/2008,"trading/marketsi've only ever been interested in doing high level trading in a video game.i'm sorry, i don't want to haul your ****ing frigate from jita to esa. no interest whatsoever.i wouldn't mind having one of my hauler slaves doing it for me though.the shipping part of trading holds a lot of interest to players. doing the grunt work not so much. especially on lowly requests.sure maybe hauling a metric-****ton of compressed minerals from jita all the way to your 0.0 industrial backbone might be a satisfying and rewarding feat, but what about some guy that is going to bed and wants someone to haul their thorax 20 jumps?micro-level shipping isn't done well in eve. repetitive/recurring industrial level shipping is ok. eve copies the huge overseas port hub to port hub equivalent just fine. eve fails at the ups level.i believe the two roles that people would find satisfying to perform as a player would be that of manual large volume transport (freighters full of stuff), and management level of a ups branch.imagine having a limited amount of npcs employees, and you being able to remotely accept transport contracts and remotely send your employees to execute the delivery."
12/8/2008,"trading/marketsa long time ago someone suggested npc sold luxury consumables that go up in price the more they are sold.the theory is, these npc sold consumables are much better than what can be produced or bought with loyalty points, something players will definitely want. like ammos that are 33% better than loyalty-point sold ammo.on the down side, since these would go up in price the more that are sold, and the price decay slowly, these consumable items would stay at the highest price that anyone would be willing to pay, that is, luxury prices.the difference from normal faction obtained consumables, like dark blood crystals for example, would be that these luxury prices would be exiting the system, rather than being traded around the system.over time this effect would leverage the amount of disposable wealth accumulated in eve."
12/8/2008,"factional warfareonly 2 teams despite there being 4 factions = boring, not enough targets, huge blob warefare.getting faction can be a grind just to join fw. after a while of participation it is almost impossible for you to change sides.in 0.0 i can be -10.0 to an alliance one day and 10.0 the next.buuut if i want to change factions in fw for whatever reason (like oh i dont know its become 1sided/boring/stagnant), i have to put up with a huge standings grindfest."
12/8/2008,fleet warfaregreat except that a titan can jump in at any moment and end the fun.
12/8/2008,"how about entirely removing npc consumables from the game, and enable players to manufacture them :)?"
12/8/2008,"there are 2 kinds of assets in eve. loyalty points, research points, etc, are just earlier stages of isk that have not been harvested.isk and minerals. both are unlimited as they are artificially introduced into eve through overabundant amounts of asteroid belts, moons, your mom, etc.minerals exits the system when things are reprocessed, stuff gets blown up, or whenever someone quits eve. and there are a lot of ships being blown up, an overabundance of minerals drives their price down which leads to more people flying bigger ships more often, and that keeps minerals in check, in theory.isk doesn't have such a great way to exit the system. there are individuals, corporations, and alliances that are sitting on so much isk that they literally cannot spend it all. theres nothing for them to buy, they've won the game of eve wealth accumulation.but lets then offer them something from an npc that they cant get anywhere else. a faction tempest with 8 turrets, the extra grid/cpu to use them, and 10% damage and rof per minmatar battleship bonus.holy crap right? i must have that right?the npc auctions off 10 in jita everyday.first day's minimum bid is 1 billion, every subsequent day the minimum bid is raised to the highest bid of previous day.minimum bid decays 100mil per day if no bids are made that day.now thats a way to leverage wealth. this would actually help everybody in eve. rich people get stuff to spend their wealth on, and everyone else's isk becomes more valuable as wealth is leveraged."
12/8/2008,"so join a corp to fight these evil people. mummy will be so proud of her liddle soldier when he fights these ebil piwates. in other news, post with you're main."

12/8/2008,"3) ship fitting made easy  raised by tusko hopkins & scagga laebetrovoscagga introduced the issue and possible solutions. extreme agreed with the solution but only if the sheet cannot be traded, he also noted that the fitting sheet would become outdated with skill advances, and that people would just create cookie cutter setups with them. scagga responded that half of the idea was to make them tradeable and that skill advances would have no effect on the sheets as they are purely to fit a ship and it was a moot point. he also noted that most people post their setups to forums, so these sheets would have no impact on that area. issler liked the general idea but thought the solution was a bit impractical. omber agreed with the idea in principle as well, but thought it would be far easier for ccp to implement it as an import/export system rather than spend time creating a new interface and artwork for it. scagga believes that the time required to do as suggested was minimal. darius noted that we were getting into too much detail again. ankhe suggested fitting template codes which could be exchanged. lavista noted we were still being technical and supposed to just provide high level issues and solutions, not minutiae. ankhe showed an example of how guildwars does templates. tusko likes the general idea, just has issues with the suggested implementation. issler agreed we should just send ccp the idea and let them sort out the details. extreme thought that considering the large amount of important issues out there, this shouldnt be sent to ccp to waste their time.vote: passed 6-3, nos were extreme, lavista (believes too much confusion from csm side), pattern clarc (abstained)4) removing t1 meta-0 lootpostponed to next meeting5) ui new context menulavista introduced the topic and showed us this nice picture by entity"

12/9/2008,"that's not really enough, it needs more dps to be atleast close to the other dreads and it needs a better tank. double weapon bonuses built into the hull, a cpu boost, and one or two midslots are what it needs at bare minimum.i'm always primaried aside from pos shots i don't really know why though."
12/9/2008,"poss need to be completely re-examined. they need to be purchased, setup, and fueled. besides being a huge isk sink, they are a fun sink and should be put out of our misery."

12/9/2008,great idea.edit boxed checked
12/9/2008,nao!
12/9/2008,i'll just leave my thumb here while i log in to change my skills.
12/9/2008,agree.
12/9/2008,"yeah, without ghost training, whats the harm in a queue? this idea has my full support."
12/9/2008,i'd support this even if its just the next level up in the same skill.
12/9/2008,"i'm in favor of a limited queue, maybe up to 24 hours ahead, or no more than 1 additional skill. or maybe have a ""queuing"" skill that gives one additional queue slot per level. but for all of you who are saying there's no reason for an unlimited queue: there is. you shouldn't be able to advance that far in any game without ever logging in. eve is already miles ahead of other games that require you to mindlessly grind away to raise skills; thats one of its big drawing points imo. but is it so much to ask that you actually play the game once in a while to switch your skills? i get that rl stuff comes up. thats why i'm in favor of a small queue. but i really can't advocate a system where someone could set up training and come back 3 months later with massive amounts of new skills, with zero effort. ""but i pay my monthly fee!"" yes, you do. that money pays for servers and devs and what not, and gives you access to the games content. it doesn't necessarily entitle you to do whatever you want, or to dictate the rules of the game. the dev's have decided they don't want people to be able to skill gain that effortlessly, so thats the way it is. and i like it that way.but, to reiterate again, i am in favor of a skill queue of some kind, just not the unlimited/nigh-unlimited kind some have proposed."
12/9/2008,"yes, 1 or 2 skills, for those of us who like to try to have a life activity greater than 7 hours. like work. it is ccp's social responsibility."
12/9/2008,to be able to queue an additional skill to level or being able to set a single skill to keep leveling would be great. i recently went away for 2 weeks and had no way to use that time correctly.+1 for queue system

12/9/2008,"you're talking about a single-planet system with multi-mb/s transfer rates. prime fiction clearly states that the bandwidth of a fluid router is very low, which is why text messaging is the prime mode of communication between capsuleers.i will not support the suggestion for various reasons, but it does raise a relevant point. ambulation will see a lot of people walking around alone in stations, even in system with high traffic. on the flipside, the opening of high-profile meeting places will attract people to dock at new places, possibly rerouting parts of the economy as one popular joint attracts more people, leading to the development of a small market hub, etc.ambulation will not be without its problems, but this suggestion is not addressing one of them. rather, it addresses a symptom and i think that the suggestion will in fact have a negative effect on the potential ambulation has for development of the game world./thumbdown."

12/9/2008,"this looks like one of the best thought out fixes for 0.0 i've ever seen. it wouldn't solve everything, but it'd be a good step. supported."
12/9/2008,anything to lower 0.0 defensive advantages.i'll never understand why game developers are so concerned with having such redonkulous defensive advantages.
12/9/2008,"i was actually going to propose allowing lower dps turrets be allowed inside the bubble? jeese what a nerf that'd be. just about anyone and their mom could come along and destroy ur stuff.because there are people in corps with towers of say 20 people who play enough eve to construct things at the pos or research or whatever... who can achieve 2 hours a day of gameplay... they can get their guns onlined incase of war... but they are out earning money to pay their subscription otherwise.lets speak about high sec pos because i'm a carebear... it's what i know well. frankly... any changes you propose have an effect on high sec pos also.i dont need the big guns. generally speaking i can use only medium guns and if i spread them around... anything small... even cruisers-battlecruisers are alpha strike and killed. even the strongest tanks around cant survive the entire blast and will be forced to warp.but if enough battleships show up to fight the tower. they can eventually incapacitate the guns and have a go at the tower.they can put my tower into reinforced long before i we get enough ships together to put up a fight against their force.right now there is a balance. it takes a proper force to fight against the pos where the guns are the primary defence.where as the pos can cost 500mil-1bil. it takes roughly the same isk to fight it.now you propose a change that allows pos to be popped easily.that's just it. pvp has changed to blob or be blobbed. if you are going around and they are hiding in pos. that pretty much means u are blobbing them and they cant blob u back. so they use their option of hide.same thing works if there's stations or safespot cycling. pos pretty much is the same as safespot cycling except it costs isk, has upkeep; and they are more or less non-solo.i'm all for the pos reform. have all these items taken off seed and have blueprints seeded. create tech 2 pos... and pos modules.1 tower can be the capital logistics tower. operates the jammers, generators, and jumpbridge. also perhaps the other things like maintenance arrays.1 tower can be the system logistics tower. silos, moon mining, reactors, shipscanning and refining.1 tower can be the carebear tower. manufacturing and research.1 tower can be the deathstar tower. a staging logistical link tower. all about the pew pew and boooom.lawl. what! you meant month? just mis-typed it twice? this would shut down so many towers it is ridiculous."
12/9/2008,supporting. these are some well thought out ideas.
12/9/2008,"structure hp stay the same, and yea, that's kinda the point... you spend more time in smaller regions of space defending rather than vast territories. guns are there to buy time, not to defend the towers for you.blobs exist because they're the predominant means of 0.0 warfare due to the implementations of pos and sov. when you make sov harder to hold, when you make pos easier to attack, smaller groups take on the challenge because it's not so menacing anymore.you talk about empire, and 20 man corporations. by all rights, you shouldn't be able to hold that tower forever. but there are other means such as other moons or mercenaries (an art that was also lost to blobbing) for you to sustain. a 20 man corp isn't expected to take in the same share of success that a 0.0 entity is with a moon. you choose to be small, and that means you're needs are easier to satisfy.people think small time corps should be able to make trillions of isk, but for what? you want to buy game time cards... others are actually putting that isk to use fighting wars, a practical game app. come back with a better arguement against it, because so far you've got nothin. that's referring to the cyno jammer fuel on a normal tower (ie not a jammer tower), not the tower's fuel use to stay online. i mean, did you just skim this?"
12/9/2008,"allow me to quote yourself. again. any changes to pos. also translate to high sec. unless you want to unbalance highsec pos system and allow the attackers to hurt the 2hours a day players... the non-addicts; or rather the to busy to play.this hurts their gameplay.which is why ccp wants to totally desync the sovereignty to pos thing. their going idea was objectives... such as trading or gate camping as a goal of obtaining further sovereignty; even if pos arent anchored.no it means that you cant put up towers because anyone who comes around can effectively wreak havoc on your pos. there are many people who have no interest in 0.0 for its resources... they go around to cause destruction and if you make pos combat easy and to where you can time it when there arent enough people online to even defend your pos. it goes pop.lets say for some reason bob gives up... moves all their pilots to high sec to cause trouble. they could field 100 bs fleets with the purpose of destroying pos structures in hopes of getting lewt.the 20 man corp cant hold that tower. it will die. the thing is... there's sooo many moons out there. you really only compete over a handful of systems which are strategically placed. so if i dont necessarily need my pos 3 jumps from jita or something... i'm quite safe. anyone who really wardecs me to shoot my pos isnt fighting over my pos; but there's always merc corps who get paid 100mil isk just to go blow up tower x in system x... so they do. there is also grief corps out there who have 6 people. 5 bs, 1 logistics. that pretty much can kill any high sec pos; as long as they know what they are doing. they pay the 2mil isk and then go blow up ur pos. hoping for bpos being copied or bpos being built. you essentially want to unbalance this and make it even easier. perhaps even just 1man corps can go kill a pos after?same? 0.0 can anchor carrier-dread building arrays? if you have sovereignty even supercap building. with sovereignty you even get fuel bonuses. high sec cant moon mine... or use reactors or do a dozen other things.trillions? you are basically saying that the risk isnt high enough for high sec pos and thusly make the risk soooo high that it's indefensible. i get wardecced while i'm online. tommorrow they can shoot me... i goto sleep because i have an early morning... while im sleeping they incapacitate my guns. reinforce my pos. tommorrow when my pos comes out of reinforce... again im sleeping. my pos goes pop. hardly acceptable."

12/9/2008,"agreed, i will also point that the term griefing is subjective according to one views and experiences. how i perceive being war dec'ed maybe different than someone else. i also have to ask why is it that the term griefing is almost always applied towards pvp? how come no one whines about market manipulation being griefing? afterall someone elses margins and possible source of income is getting distorted and perhaps crushed... it would be foolish to apply the term ""griefer"" solely to pvpers and pvp. as i would argue that in almost every facet of eve, you are competing with other players in some form or another even if you are not shooting at each other, hence eve is a ""player vs player"" game. if you are competing against other players then the potential for griefing exists.."

12/9/2008,"i'd have thought most of the titan pilots would welcome having something a little more exciting to do with their ships than the occasional dd and squirting freighters around. speed mainly, changing the stats of a ship is way faster than coming up with names, designs, models, bpo's, etc etc etc. ugh, no. it's a space game, it's supposed to be far fetched"
12/9/2008,"that ""check here if you want to give your support"" radio box is the place to show that mitten. :-) i'd love to get a view here from a current titan pilot as to what they think of this..? point any you know at this thread please."
12/9/2008,"i'll give this a thumb. not primarily because of the original suggestion, but because (as the poster above me says) the assets window needs some attention. great improvements can be made with relatively little effort, i assume.one thing i have missed since i started playing the game is increased column functionality. for example, having a ""jumps"" column just like on the market."
12/9/2008,"i can see how this system would be abused. however, what about people who lost sec status from killing macroers/isk farmers in low sec that ccp hasn't done anything about? those guys are sacrificing sec status to do something that helps ccp, yet they get no reward, and penalized for it. i support this idea."
12/9/2008,"hello all,due to putting my previous proposal on hold, i have decided to put forth for comment the following idea. i believe that all ores should be distributed, in varying qualities, in all regions of space. this would allow the high-security 'carebears' to mine the ore for their ship, and give reason to mine ores in lower securities of space.in null-sec, this would give them the veldspar they need to construct their massive engines of war without a dependance upon high-security space. they would still have a demand, given profit per hour, of the high-end minerals.in low-sec, this would give some incentive for miners to come there. they would, of course, bring protection fleets (as not many mine in low-sec without them), giving rise to pvp.in high-sec, miners would now have a reason to mine veldspar in 0.6 space rather than 1.0 space. likewise, the ores gained from high-security space could allow a soloist carebear to use his own minerals to make his ship.the full concept, with quality names, is visible on my webpage under enhanced mining > ore distribution. your constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated on ways to improve this or reasons to delay or cancel it."
12/9/2008,"i like it, but having done most of eve's content in all security zones in eve, i think its critical to get the right risk vs reward balance based on zones of safety.1.0 - 0.5 = the same. concord protection is concord protection is concord protection. 100% safe to mine if you have any clue at how to play eve, or abuse concord mechanics. (which i've never seen ccp punish ever)0.4 - 0.1 = the same. a sentry gun is a sentry gun, and sec status penalty is a sec status penalty. lowsec is arguably the most dangerous place to mine0.0 = farther away from market hub, arguably much safer than lowsec, but no safety or disincentives.for the purpose of current hisec/lowsec ores:hisec ores are safe thus compression should be lower.lowsec and 0.0 ores should be about the same tbh.for the purpose of current 0.0 only ores:hisec and lowsec should have them at exploration sites, smaller roids and lower compression in hisec, bigger roids and higher compression in lowsec.unchanged for 0.0, they're everywhere.i think this should apply for moons as well, though arguably it'd be pointless as 0.0 moon mining's bottom line is so much lower that it would allow 0.0 moon miners to make a good profit by selling their moon miners at lower than your bottom line.toyota vs gm guess im not thumbs-upping cause its not a proposal."
12/9/2008,"this is the 2nd half arsed thought out idea i have seen from you now. i hope those that voted for you are wishing they could recast their votes.there is so much veld already in 0.0. they are often refered to as ""veldspar moons"" they are that big. why would they have the same profit per hour, of high ends, and why should they?i think that is the exactly what ccp does not want, they wish for the markets to be dynamic, they wish for interregional trade, they want this to be a mmo, and not about being able to do everything as a solo player.tl;dr = no"
12/9/2008,"becoming self-sufficient (as in, requiring the bare minimum trade/interaction needed to maintain a given playstyle) should be very difficult to pull off."
12/9/2008,"i am guessing you have not lived in 0.0? nobody in their right mind will mine veld in 0.0 for two reasons, there are usually other more profitable asteroids to mine i.e. a/b/c/mercoxit. and also there are haulers spawns that drop massive amounts of trit and pyerite, fairly regualarly too. people who want to make isk in 0.0 don't mine veldspar period... and alliances who need large quantities of low ends like trit and pyerite for capitial production are still importing what they need from empire.please try taking the time to learn or experience things that you are unfamilar with before making suggestions/proposals that highlight such ignorance...edit: as treelox already commented there is plenty of veld in 0.0, there are good reasons for why its not being mined."
12/9/2008,"i gotta say no on this too.i understand the need for more low end ore in 0.0. or some way of getting more low ends to 0.0. but i don't want to ""normalize"" the roid belts across all regions. the others are right in that it would take something dynamic (movement of goods/people) and turn it static (never having to leave a region/constellation)."
12/9/2008,i'm having trouble seeing that this is any different... let alone any better than what things are currently at.no.
12/9/2008,"alright, back to the drawing board then. would you rather have a candidate who let you know what was going on and wanted the input, or one who made vast changes without the public's recognition?the idea was posted in here a long time ago, and was well received, so i refined and collated the ideas. for the point being, please view my webpage and tell me which ideas you think would be good for the game, or which ideas you would put forth."
12/9/2008,"comments:the ore distribution idea is not bad (i was one of the people supporting nyphur original suggestion) even if the comment about keeping the interdependency between empire and 0.0 is valid. but i think it would be more in the range of finished goods/npc goods from empire to 0.0., raw minerals (and special npc stuff) from 0.0 to empire. so supportedasteroid belts is something ccp has always stated they want to develop. so again supported.you know i disagree with the pirate raids idea. two general comment about your site and threads:- linking the site to your signature is god, but would be better if it was a very visible link. normally people don't go around clicking on poster banners. - when you propose something, put the proposal on forum, not on your personal site. a lot of people will be vary on clicking on a link to a unknown website. you can always say ""further material in mi site at www.whatever"". edit:yes, even if we disagree, putting your suggestion on forum is the right way to go. simply i think you should put them up several days before presenting them to the csm and see what the coimment and suggestion are. edit 2: added thumb up. i don't concur completely but it is worth discussing."
12/9/2008,i don't think all of your idea is bad. i just don't want to see a general redistribution across all regions.the whole high-grade/low-grade stuff is interesting though.
12/9/2008,the idea that 0.0 alliance must travel back to empire is stupid imo. you're supposed to be able to build your own sovereign nation but you can't drill your own oil? gotta go back to empire and get it from papa jita. that would suck.
12/9/2008,"ive always thought it a bit odd how you can mine 1 ore and refine to get only some things.tbh the higher end ores that are in 0.0 and such. should have built in veldspar. mine the same amount of bistot but you get a small amount of pyerite, zydrine, and megacyte.doesnt make alot of sense in real life. you can find very rare roids that have bismuth bits in it... but's it very rare... but you will get lots and lots of all the other things of like the common stuff.tbh those high end ores in 0.0 should be boosted to where they get lots of tritanium and such also.right now bistot refines topyerite:170zydrine:341megacyte:170it wont hurt to make it 20m3 instead of 16m3 and inject appropriate amounts of trit-mex-iso-nox"
12/9/2008,"there is plenty of trit yielding ore in 0.0, but it is ignored. since miners in consider it ""easier"" to only mine for high value minerals, sell those and then import whatever low ends they might need. they consider it more time efficent."
12/9/2008,"bunyip, a word of advice - when you make a proposal this counterintuitive, actually spell out the proposal in the thread. i rather like the idea, but i've talked to you before about it and thus i know what it is. if i was looking at this thread cold, my reaction would be basically the same as the others though - ""wtf? no!"". there's a big difference between *more* veld in 0.0 and *better* veld in 0.0 - adding more does nothing, making it 5x as concentrated does huge, huge things to the economy and trade flows of the game, and you didn't make that clear. as for the idea itself, i don't think i support it. the idea of mineral flows between regions is a good one - it encourages motion, trade, and piracy - and given that your proposal will likely ultimately wind up as a mining yield bonus proportional to the sec status of the system you're in, it seems a bit bland. i'd agree that the minerals versus sec status progression needs a lot of work, but i think that there are better fixes than this one. interesting idea, and i'd almost like to see ccp's reaction, but i don't think i want it happening."
12/9/2008,"i didn't even see any windows into space in any of the wis vids or screenshots. and i don't mean real time rendering of station vicinity with ships, i mean just the space-scape that matches the station location to show that the facility you are walking through is in the space that you saw before docking.anyway, docking bays, windows into space, something to show the nature of the place and its connection to the rest of eve."
12/9/2008,proposal:have each section of the mini map open individually and be able to pin it.reason:the mini map takes up a massive portion of the screen compared to it's utility. the only part of it i ever use is the solar system map so why not be able to use just this small section of the map and have it pinned in the corner of your screen?implementation:each of the 4 sections of the minimap could be deployed from drop down menus:______________|minimap.....0_x|-------------------|universe....... ^||region.......... ^||constellation. ^||solar system. ^|-------------------with all the menus expanded it would look similar to how it does now but you could scale it down to a more usable size if you are using it for one specific task such as scanning down enemy ships.edit: pathetic attempt at recreating menus with a text editor
12/9/2008,"thumb up for this. i've always found the map browser very useful, but it takes up way too much space. to have it detachable and with an option to cover stuff like the universe overview would be a great boon."
12/9/2008,"yup, i'm for it being more useful."
12/9/2008,"thanks for your suggestions chaps - i'm interested to follow them through with a view to include them in the second part of the proposal, which may be posted in a couple of weeks or so.while i'm at it, i might as well support this."
12/9/2008,"another thought i had quite recently (it's a tiny thing really but would be nice): currently ""target"" broadcasts disappear after a while. it'd be nice to have a primary target broadcast which was permanent on their ship both in space and in your overview till the fc removed it or used the broadcast on another ship."
12/9/2008,i agree with this. heck i even tried to start a thread about this.thumbs up!
12/9/2008,"this needs to be addressed.if you have the balls to come salvage you should have the threat of being owned as well. saying ""go somewhere else"" as the result of the actions of someone exploiting a loophole ccp has failed to address is an idiotic response. i am hardly surprised though.give people an option to defend their assets. telling them to pay for an additional account to drag along because of ccp's lack of foresight is pretty ignorant."
12/9/2008,wrecks are no-one's assets until they are salvaged. working as intended...
12/9/2008,"wrecks are yours because you killed the ship to create them. hence the corporation tag at the end of it. (*gasp* logic?!)allowing people to salvage your wrecks while leaving the loot is an obviously moronic loophole. it's stealing.if you want to be a prick and come in to salvage someone else's earned work, you should gain aggro and be able to get punished for it. aka killed for being a thief.this robs mission runners of income in no different way than if they were to loot the wrecks directly, none whatsoever. (except the obvious fact they can't be retaliated upon for whatever stupid reason hasn't been fixed yet)"
12/9/2008,"it is not stealing. the devs have said so, there are plenty of ways to deal with it - live with it. if it was considered stealing then you would get flagged, you don't, so it isn't. just because a vocal minority want it to be considered stealing does not make it so. in fact go try it some time - its fun! you know - why we play games!"
12/9/2008,"how is taking someone else's work not stealing? explain this to me. you can't.just because a developer decides something doesn't make it right. we all know this. they're not infallible. they're far from it, in-fact.it's stealing, plain and simple. you only disagree because you're happily stealing from people with no fear of repercussions as the result of a glaring oversight in mechanics that they won't address.you don't steal the loot because you'll get owned.you salvage because there's a major loophole preventing you from getting owned in retaliation for stealing their salvage. it's not your wreck, end of story."
12/9/2008,i have to concur with finawin...ninja salvagers have it made in the shade.there is zero risk to what they do... literally.re-balancing is needed!

12/9/2008,"in empire, moons in good research-systems are spammed with offline poses and without dreads, it's a pain to remove them with battleships only. and in 0.0, alliances could even abuse this system to spam every moon in a system to avoid hostiles to put up towers. furthermore, it is rediculous, that offline towers have the same amount of shield/armor/structure and even shield recharge as online towers. poses are abused as place holders.so my suggestion: make offline-pos ""hackable"" or introduce another game mechanics to unanchor them. because if someone doesn't refuel and care about his tower, other people should just be able to loot it with just a few more effort than unmanned ships in space or containers. offline-pos are just annoying space junk."
12/9/2008,i would say let the empire faction either destroy it or sell it off in such a way that you could rebuy it.
12/9/2008,"of course i support my idea another issue i forgot to mention:offline towers create ded-mails when they get attacked just like online ones. so if you are sitting in empire hitting a tower with 30 bs, it is not unusual that the owner just shows up, ninja-refuels the tower, anchors some mods and you have to retreat. so if you want to make shure the offline tower gets destroyed, you have to bring enough battle-ships to pop it in reasonable time before the owner shows up with a single hauler. but not every empire corp can bring the 100 man blobb, i think it is even more than an average empire corp has as total member count."
12/9/2008,"i like the idea of a hackable offline tower. i'm not sure whether towers apply to the ""30 days and it's gone"" container rule, but i have seen evidence of offline towers already. i'll add this to my list of things to recommend to the csm when the major issues have been dealt with."
12/9/2008,"some thing needs to be done about it, almost every high sec system that has some research & factory slots are spammed to death by offline towers."
12/9/2008,i'm all about reducing clutter.
12/9/2008,"i don't really like this. i'd rather see offline towers and mods go the way of the gsc, that is >poof< upon expiration of 30 days. no point rewarding some trash hauler with nothing better to do than search out dg towers all day long."
12/9/2008,"yes, i already thought of treating pos like gscs, but i think people will just go round and unanchor/reanchor their pos and reserve the moon for just another 30 days."
12/9/2008,"if you leave something in space, unprotected, and someone with the right skills comes along, they should be able to take it for profit. that is what would happen to a ship right?i can see it now. someone jumping online knowing the fuel is gone and crossing their fingers that the pos is still there when they log in slade"
12/9/2008,i've been thinking about this. i remember a time when ccp declared that cargo cans used to 'reserve' moons was an exploit. perhaps they should just increase this to include poses that have been offline for an extended period.just my .02 isk
12/9/2008,"would also be a solution. but i think, a pure player driven game mechanic would be less stress for everyone than using the petition system. i also wouldn't mind if there would be a module to >poof< offline poses to sink some more useles isk in eve, or make it skill/chance based if a tower goes >poof< while ""hacking"" it or not. all i want is a game mechanic to get rid of offline towers without bringing out teh blobb"
12/9/2008,"if its that big of a deal... have them go ""poof"" in 48 hours much like the usual garbage that gets cleared.this forces everyone to be ""studious"".you snooze... you loose."
12/9/2008,scrambler -9km 2 pointsdisruptor -24km 1 pointhictor -30km 8 pointsonyx-broadsword capable of a passive shield tank that is basically strong enough to tank any single target indefinitely; only exception being carriers-moms; ironically being the purpose of the ship tobeginwith.nerf the focused warp disruption script to do 1 of the following.1. range the warp scrambler more inline with the other ewar modules. for example have it be roughly 5km from the ship it is scrambling.2. kill the sensor resolution so that scrambling small ships or even battleships is very difficult. the ship was designed to scramble the low sec ewar immune motherships. it will be a reasonable thing if it has no trouble targeting capital ships; but nothing else in any reasonable amount of time.3. something else that would balance the situation.ps i didnt lose a ship or something to prompt this thread. i havent been anywhere near low sec since hictors were created. i used to live in low sec.
12/9/2008,"no. i do not think there are any issues here, nothing to fix."
12/9/2008,@op stfu you lying noobyour just buttsore that you lost an industrial to a oynx.
12/9/2008,"lol can't access the link, but if its true then needless to say facepalm to the op"
12/9/2008,"why the thread if you did not lose a ship to a hictor? though judging from the posts above me looks like you lost a ship to one. lying about your motivations regarding such a change does not help you postition... regarding hics.... working as intended, as they do have a number of limitations."
12/9/2008,"hictors are fine, not supported at all."
12/9/2008,no....the only problem i have with interdiction is there's no way to counteract the pesky warp disruption bubble.but then again that's what covert-op's cloaks are for.
12/9/2008,hic's already got nerfed; it's called the new jumpgates. i'd say no to this one.
12/9/2008,wow. nearly 7 months ago.goood job newwwb.ps killboards arent very reliable.naglfar deathnever happened. i've never been in 24th imperial. all these are from sisi you newb.
12/9/2008,your the noob for stating you haven't been in lowsec since before the heavy dictors were introduced but guess what ?? the kill mail link i posted shows you in lowsec being killed by a heavy dictor. that makes you a liar.
12/9/2008,edit: misread
12/9/2008,didn't you read the op?the naughty hictors chased him away.
12/9/2008,ya and i'm in syndicate also on sisi. what's your point?only ships ive lost have been the myrm-vexor from tama-oto. a stealth bomber the day ea came out and i went to see the high sec leviathan and lagged out and got smartbombed.
12/9/2008,what is this? crime and punishment?
12/9/2008,why do you keep trolling?
12/9/2008,"only cause they are discussing this in caod and it doesn't appear (though i haven't looked that hard) in here yet.[proposal]from general consensus on caod, a proposal to removal of all ded mails sent when a pos is attacked. high/low/0.0......no mails period.[not part of the current proposal]maybe an external api thingie would be a better bet....you guys can discuss that. something along the lines of the ability to hit the api every 12 hours."
12/9/2008,there should be a single mail message that your pos has been attacked.one for when it's destroyed.no information is worse than being spammed.it may be some pest who thought it would be cute to attack it... but then you find out its tanking it nicely.so i don't support this thread...yes... stop spamming... but make the information constructive...and not so annoying.
12/9/2008,"i don't know how often you get notified (never had a pos under my control attacked), but i feel you need to know if it is attacked and to get a pretty constant flow of information on what is happening. best option would be a corporate tool where ceo, directors and pos caretakers would see the status of every pos from range (with no limit to the range).at the same time a mail every time someone start attacking a pos (i.e. pos shield go under 100%) and then when it reach 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% shield and armor would be reasonable i think. something similar for modules outside the shield too, with a lower number of messages (100% and 0% maybe). it would be a lot of spammage if some pos with a lot of guns was attacked, but information is important.an alternative would be some kind of blinking icon to warn you of pos messages, with the messages displayed in some kind of modified chat channell, with only some ""important"" message sent wia eve mail."
12/9/2008,"this idea has been voiced in coad as part of a general discussion as to what is worrying people from the game here is the link for anyone who wants to check it out.coad discussionhowever one of the ideas quite a few people seem to like is the removal of ded messages about a pos being attacked. what i particularly like about it is that is would force large alliances to actually patrol the space they own and have to put some effort into looking after their money making assets, rather than just sit there and wait for a ded mail then do along and blob the hell out of attacking force.this is an idea that could dramatically increase the amount of fighting going on, as smaller alliances/corps might feel like taking a chance more if they figure they might actually get the pos down and get their own up before the incumbant alliance rolls up to try and take it back. i think this is an idea with real promise."
12/9/2008,"its a wonderful ideait gives a value to scouting, patrolling space, encourages combat, rewards opportunists and gives the 'little guy' a chance against the static powerblocsi cannot see any downsidescombine it with removing instant local and its a dream come true"
12/9/2008,"they could just tie it to the corp interface. so yes its available to remotely find out if your pos's are under attack. but it doesnt ""alert"" you that its taking dmg. you just have to actively be watching it 24/7 (or at least someone in the corp)"
12/9/2008,"it should be through the corp management window, not mail, and it should give you information in a useful fashion. off the top of my head, i'd have an ""alerts"" page on the top, that informs you when a tower has been attacked/reinforced/destroyed, and a set of expandable menus(region/system/tower) where you can see what percentage shields are at on each, whether any modules on it are damaged, whether it's reinforced, and how long it's been since the last attack. also, throw the fuel notices into there too - alerts for towers under 24 hours and towers without fuel, and have the time until zero fuel display on each tower. that might be a bit too much in the way of database operations to be practical, but something along those lines would be a great boon to pos management and to making mail usable for directors of major corporations. as for an api interface, the idea of a corporate api is an interesting one. break it into sections, and let players have access to everything that their character has the roles for - fuel notices, attack notices, membership, votes outstanding(to shareholders), all of that. could be very useful, assuming it could be made to work in the way i think it could.that said, i can't support this thread - removal of notices is going too far the other way."
12/9/2008,vessper (sp?) is developing a package called evehq that will be implimenting corp management of assets.... perhaps that would be handy for people who are not logged in addition to everything else.the data is there..... just a matter of using it.
12/9/2008,i dont see an issue with the alerts as far as fuel levels go etc. but there should be no kinda warning about an attack. putting the warning message about an attack in an alert instead of a ded mail changes nothing. there should be no substitute for someone actually having to patrol starbases every few days to make sure they're ok. if they want the space they should have to work to maintain it. if people wanna make 70k/u off dyspro they should be prepared to put in a little leg work for it.
12/9/2008,why not just take the penalties off stabs? the stabs are worthless now with hictors anyway.the stabs using a slot is penalty enough. it's 1 less tank slot or dmg mod or whatever. plenty disadvantage there.
12/9/2008,"careful for what you ask for, as removing penalties on stabs would bring back the 1-2 stabed vagas that were popular before stabs were nerfed (compare to nanos were before the nerf)"
12/9/2008,thank you for proving my point....
12/9/2008,"indeed their current role is for some of them are intended as stepping stones to haulers and mining barges, both of which have dedicated tech 1 and tech 2 counterparts.and destroyers are for salvaging you fool! its in their tooltip. honest.i might use the exequror for hauling, until i can use aniteron:gallente industrial i (rank 4)spaceship command iii (rank 1)gallente frigate iii (rank 2)and atractor beam:science iv (rank 1)i might use an osprey or scimitar, until i can use aprocurer:mining barge i (rank 4)astrogeology iii (rank 3)science iv (rank 1)mining iv (rank 1)industry v (rank 1)and astrip miner:mining iv (rank 1)now i must disagree that the role of tech 1 logistics cruisers is to hold over industrial players for the 3 days it takes to train for an industrial or the 2 weeks it takes to train for a mining barge.these cruisers are not the tech 1 equivalent of hulks or cranes, they're the tech 1 variation of guardians and basilisks.now these cruisers don't come anywhere close to performing the roles of hulks, cranes, not even of the tech 1 variety.sadly, these cruisers aren't close to performing the role of logistics either.the combat cruisers got their review, where both tech 1 and tech 1 got attention. i remember because my omens used to only have 4 turrets! now they have 5.well when tech 2 logistics was reviewed long ago, their tech 1 counterparts were overlooked.and i can't make it any clearer that this proposal is simply a request for review.funfact: these ships have never been boosted. tech 1 cruisers have only ever been revised on their damage output and slot allocation.no bonuses other than combat have ever been revised, which is exactly why these ships are due for a checkup. show me someone that would train racial cruiser v, signature analysis v, long range targeting v, and spend 50million isk for the sole purpose to haul less than 1,000m3 or to mine with miner 1's, and i'll show you a fool. :ppoint being, theres no problem with people using exequror as a salvager, or with using scimitar or osprey as a stepping stone to a mining barge. those are fine, they're very temporary stepping stones and there are no ships made for salvaging.but what of the remote repper/booster bonuses? if those are intended to be a stepping stone to tech 2 logistics, then they fall flat on their face. a ferocious faceplant."
12/9/2008,"it's not a terrible suggestion, but those ships are more or less intended to be mining ships with a minimal support role in fleets, not as actual logistics ships. only really the auguror is any good at its logistics role, and even then it's hardly spectacular. but then, these are the cheapest of the cruisers, they're not supposed to be very good in combat. i'd support making them better, but i can't reasonably suggest that you make them good. the exequror makes a good salvage vessel? how do you figure? it's got four high slots - i'd argue that you need a bare minimum of six to be worth considering as a viable salvager, and anything less than eight feels really dirty."
12/9/2008,"the reason i say that is because they have the same speed (roughly) as a destroyer, a lot bigger cargohold (for those level 4 missions), and 2 salvagers and 2 tbs should be plenty. however, my mission ship is also a salvager, so i take care of most of the wrecks before i turn the mission in while my drones kill away. the only things i have left to salvage after the mission are the wrecks that are a long way out and far apart.oh, and max, an osprey/scythe mines more than a procurer. the retriever is usually the first step into mining for most aspiring prospectors."
12/9/2008,"ah, if you salvage with your combat ship, i suppose that makes some sense. still not the first ship i'd pick, but okay."
12/9/2008,"currently, the only reason to even have a high sec pos is for research. sure, that's all well and good. however, if a corp works thier faction standing up high enough (very hard to do, especially if you have a large corp), then they should deserve a little more of an incentive imo. i am suggesting that they not only allow highsec moon mining, but also fuel discounts depending upon corporate faction standings. it could work something like this...7.00-8.00 faction standings - 5% fuel discount8.00-9.00 faction standings - 10% fuel discount9.00-10.00 faction standings - 15% fuel discount(something similar to the benefits of sov, but not quite as good)as for the moon mining, the pos itself shows the materials that could be mined, it's just the fact you can't anchor the moon harvesting array in high sec. so why show a material that will never be able to be harvested? i am not saying to load up high sec moons with uber materials, but at least allow us to moon mine the junk stuff in high sec, maybe even allow us a reactor too so simple junk reactions can also be made. it's not like this system could be abused easily what with the standing requirements. in the event it starts to be abused, ccp can just establish a minimum member count for a corp to even be allowed to set one up, so it prevents all these crazy one man corps with blobs of pos's everywhere. so in conclusion, i feel high sec moon mining should be allowed, as well as fuel discounts based upon corporate faction standings. any stipulations put into place to regulate it would also be welcomed, no sense in everyone and thier dog having a high sec pos."
12/9/2008,"so you want to allow moon mining in highsec?moon mining is one of the reasons for setting up a pos in low sec (if you are a small corp) what incentive would a corp have take a risk in setting up moon mining/reaction pos/pos chains in low sec if he can do it at far less risk in high sec? sure wardecs is a risk for high sec pos, but given that it takes many battleships to take down a decently setup pos in any decent amount of time as opposed to using a few sieged dreads in low sec, the risk is far less.no this is a terrible idea, as it defeats risk/reward concept between high sec/low sec/0.0. research pos is good enough for high sec."
12/9/2008,and manufacturing. i can support moon mining but i cant support fuel bonuses based on standing.because they use a randomizer to sort the stuff... unless prismx has to code all those himself. that'd be pretty damn annoying. as for storyline... moons are made of something? not just emoragetears.nah. reactors shouldnt be allowed in high sec.dysporium moons and such? they do exist in low sec. certainly have none in high sec.
12/9/2008,"it would be hasty to conclude that high sec has no high-end moons, as i can't remember anyone bothering to scan and create highsec moon maps. even then, smaller profits can be made after fuel costs on the lesser moons, again removing any incentive to mine the intermediate moon minerals in low sec."
12/9/2008,"""no this is a terrible idea, as it defeats risk/reward concept between high sec/low sec/0.0""first off, no one harvests the crap stuff in low sec really unless they are making reactions. the idea is to give a slightly better reward than just research. the amount of work it takes to even have the faction standings is staggering, all for what, research slots? since when do hardcore mission runners care about research? making reactions in high sec might be pushing it, but moon mining in high sec i think is feasible. maybe they could gimp it slightly by reducing moon mining yield in high sec, so that way, people with low sec pos's are still happy. perhaps even the fuel discount idea stated above is a bit much, i am just trying to come up with ideas that makes a high sec pos a little bit more interesting without disrupting the risk/reward concept stated above. also, high sec pos manufacturing is well...a waste, as manufacturing inside a high sec station is much more efficient."
12/9/2008,many people want to have a staging pos in low sec. they then can pop up chose a lower end moon instead of a dysp moon and that way avoiding people from wanting to come smoke you to get the moon.from my experience... the low sec moons generally have1 fair metal and then other stuff. people can come along with 1-2 dreads and say that they can be safe doing that.if you allow high sec moon mining... people with such moons will have significantly safer moons then; leaving reactors in low sec would be ideal because those towers already staging there could then use the super cheap market moon minerals to react and make good isk.i assure you there's no good stuff in high sec.
12/9/2008,"as far as the moon mining goes, i could only see the very basics (the gasses and the factional metals) in high sec, and even that has a snowball's chance of happening. the facilities to use those to make the mods should never be allowed.the discount based on standing is a good idea, but needs refinement before being game-worthy. i could see a smaller discount (perhaps 2% per level over 5.0 standing), but not higher than that."
12/9/2008,"tl;dr = noso you want all the rewards of 0.0 and low sec based pos, and none of the risk? if you want those benifits, get out of the half of eve space that you seem to have trapped yourself in, and go explore low sec and 0.0.this from a confirmed carebear who is in a one man corp. i have run 4 large pos in low sec for months(in the past you post reading pirate lurkers), without a problem, except those i caused myself. jump in the water is fine."
12/9/2008,"high sec large pos's are invincible in highsec... and you want to boost them.noyou let me take offensive dreads into highsec, then we can talk"
12/9/2008,"nothing in eve is invincible. i somewhat feel that people aren't reading all of the posts to this thread. i do not want high sec pos's to have the rewards of low sec or null sec. it takes months of mission running just to be capable of even setting up a high sec pos. i just thought at the very least, there should be some form of extra reward for it outside of simple research. as for risk, i've seen a lone caracal disable the guns on a small pos in low sec before, i found it hilarious. the only reason why i feel that high sec pos's deserve any kind of beefing up is due to the work/profit of it all. i would also think that high sec greifers would like this idea, poorly defended high sec moon mining/research pos's would be well worth sending a squad of bs's after. as stated above, even if we could moon mine in high sec, it still wouldn't even come close to the profits of a low sec or 0.0 moon. also, the risk in high sec is actually greater, as anyone can war dec you and start taking shots off at your pos. in the very least, if moon mining in high sec is unacceptable, then the fuel reduction for your corp having extreme faction standings would be cool. in order to keep that fuel reduction, the corp in question would need to either recruit members with extreme standings, or not recruit at all."
12/9/2008,your not doing it right......
12/9/2008,"people post dozens of wtb contract. can we have an option so that we can filter between sale, buy, and both.that way those of us who have no interest in seeing the wtb contracts. they can set it to hide them."
12/9/2008,"a fun trick is to enter a ""1"" into the ""min price"" field same can be done to the ""max price"" field to see the flip side.tl;dr = no, the feature is already in game, you just need to apply it."
12/9/2008,that trick has a bad side effect. if you dont see it... i wont tell you.
12/9/2008,nothing to see here....;)
12/9/2008,"same here, when i'm out alone i rarely use the scanner - except in the beginning, to get a clue about average containings - and in the end, when the last locked roids shall be depleted.pain is when you're out to eat all 4 regional available types, hit the scan and got a huge listing of ore units. hard to tell how many m3 those roids will yield, unless you waste precious time on dividing amount by ore unit sizes.with the cycles timers it got nicely improved to start/stop your strips for more efficiency, but still got to fiddle around with rough guesses.in missions you adapt your fitting, to see that health bar dropping faster. in pvp you adapt your fitting / gang / tactics, to see that hostiles health bar dropping faster. in awesome drowsy mining you see no health bar at all. all you can get is a rough clue - by fitting that survey scanner, a module dedicated to mining, not using its potential fully, thus being dismissed by most of the barge pilots out there.""survey scanner? nah, bothered once, sold. fit something else.""all i'd like is to be more efficient in what i do, means spending a little less time in mining for the minerals i need please please pretty please, with tons of sugar and over nine thousand cherries on top, for the love of care kingdom, etc. etc."
12/9/2008,"i do not have a hard time calculating the m3 required to hold what i am mining. i use my scanner religously. i do not really see that this is necessary. but it is a small change that could help some people out, so i guess it can not really hurt.slade"
12/9/2008,i like the increased chance for dog tag drops as well as the better bounties. i hate gathering loot in alot of the missions and this would be a nice change.
12/9/2008,interesting ideas
12/9/2008,"i understand your motive, but i think that your idea will ultimately cause more harm than good. if bounties and mission rewards are increased, that is bad as it leads to isk inflation. if a player is hauling in mission loot (or drone alloys) then they are ""mining"" materials that are sold on the market rather than just creating isk out of thin air (there is something productive being placed into the economy via the players actions).i believe that a lot of players run missions instead of mining for a few reasons 1) it is more fun (for many, not all) 2) the skill set required to run missions heavily overlaps with the skill set required to also play in pvp. there are some players who don't/can't afford to run multiple accounts (myself included) and as such, i run missions to make my income (while waiting until i get some reasonable skills for pvp). after i get the basic skills for pvp, i will probably continue to run missions for my income for a long long time.as it stands, trit prices have been rising for all the time i have been in eve (~4 months) so i ask, is there really a problem with mining? is the problem really due to mission runner loot (many advanced mission runners don't even salvage, they just collect bounty and lp since it's not worth their time to salvage). and even if it is, is the solution really to reduce the productive input to the economy from mission running and turn it into an inflationary problem instead?if there is indeed a problem with mining, possibly increase the effectiveness of mining instead. if there is a problem with for industrialists, maybe introduce more drone missions (or change some loot to alloys) instead. (from what i have read, it seems the industrialists problem is more that players with most indy skills at 5 can sit in jita all day long and sell way under newer players costs).i don't know the solution, but i think that it is better for mission runners to collect more loot and salvage rather than isk. as far as industrialists are concerned, isn't getting meta level 0 loot the best? most people use named t1 or t2. named t1 is not affected by meta 0 loot, and t1 meta level 0 is input for t2 production (just like minerals).i've edited this post a few times now, so i'll try and stop :). but i would highly recommend that 1) you really think there is a problem 2) you think that mission running is the problem 3) you think that the resulting solution (given that most people will continue to run missions) at least isn't a detriment to eve's economy on the overall.and to decide those things, i think you might need some data from the devs."
12/9/2008,"i really do not think that this is the holy grail that manufacturs and miners think that it would be.without hard numbers from ccp, it is just your opinion that there is a problem.get hard numbers from ccp, to make your case. otherwise your trying to change something that will change a lot of ratters and mission runners alike. will affect the availblity of infrequently used modules in 0.0, low sec and in high sec."
12/9/2008,1. they stop dropping from missions.2. they have to start building the t1 mods from bpos.3. larger demand on minerals itself.4. raising prices by far.this would lead to higher prices by far. would serve to hurt non-mission runners the most. not ideal.not isk value; but mineral quantity. it balances upon the different values of minerals. this would be best. nothing changes in terms of missions except they are unable to feed the meta 0 items. meaning meta 1+ have to be melted or mining will be the ones who get boosted.not a problem in my opinion. worst one; same problems as the first one; serves to boost those who dont salvage at all. not a good option.as for tags? what tags? we pretty much have tags flooding the market with a couple exceptions. whose only use is a 1time only datacenter option. waste of time. meta 0 melts to more minerals then other metas.meta 1-3 are generally not as valuable but can be used to invent to increase your chance of successful invention.meta 4 is basically expensive t2; so not much of an option other then use.
12/9/2008,"i understand that this idea may not be popular with some people, but it accomplishes a number of superb goals. while the minerals do not make it to the market often, some mission runners are also manufacturers and use it in their own goods. i've built many dominixes due to the minerals gained from mission running alone.with this 'mineral faucet' closed, the following will happen:> high-end minerals will become more in demand from null-sec, boosting their economy.> mining will be more important to manufacturers, which i will improve the draw of in a future meeting with some of my ideas i have posted on my webpage.> mission running will be less profitable, a common gripe on the forums, while not making it worthless.for those interested in statistics, i ran one of the lowest-rewards level 4 missions and reprocessed the loot, laying out the values for all to compare, as follows:mission: unauthorized military presence (angels) level 4difficulty level: relatively easystart time: 10:47 estend time (including retrieving all dropped loot): 11:38 amtotal time: 51 minutescorporate standing gain: 2.4926%security status gain: 0.175%total bounties (all enemies killed): 4,607,946 isktotal cost of repairs: 1,325 isktotal mission reward (including early bonus): 1,383,000 iskship type used: dominix droneboat (w/salvager)total mission rewards: 5,990,946salvage gained:16 alloyed tritanium bars12 armor plates30 burned logic circuits29 charred micro circuits9 contaminated nanite compounds9 fried interface circuits5 malfunctioning shield emitters16 smashed trigger units5 thruster consoles43 tripped power circuitstotal value of salvage: 9,244,391minerals gained (refinery yield 99.5%):tritanium 205,226pyerite 78,076mexallon 17,643isogen 3064nocxium 625zydrine 72megacyte 38total value of minerals: 2,069,566sellable items gained:y-s8 hydrocarbon i afterburners425mm medium gallium i machine gun650mm medium carbine howitzer itotal value of sellable items: 534,000total value of all goods/salvage/minerals sold, as well as the bounties and mission reward: 17,838,903percentage of income from minerals alone: 11%you can see from this example that over 2m isk was made in a 51 minute stretch from the minerals alone - and this was one of the missions with the worst mineral payout. a lone hulk mining in this time (including the time to return to the station) would pull 400k isk from the tritanium from veldspar, and this is the highest-grossing mineral in high-security space that is plentifully available.a dominix is not the fastest mission-runner either, as a raven navy could easily beat it in this mission. this gives you an idea of the problem and why it should be solved. i have no problem with missions being so valuable, but giving more minerals than a top-skilled hulk in addition to the almost 16m isk from salvage, bounties, etc. only adds insult to injury.i hope i've explained it well enough, and sorry for such a long and detailed post, but i didn't want to leave anything to chance. a mission such as angel extravaganza or massive attack would pay out far more than this, even if it takes a couple of hours to do."
12/9/2008,"at a roundtable at fanfest, i asked dr eyjog about this.the basic gist was that very little minerals actually came from these sorts of activities.thus, i can't support this topic, even if i have been pushing for it for over a year now."
12/9/2008,"eeh? where you get that weird number? with my skill a hulk mining alone in a system with a station spend 1/4 of the time hauling the minerals (supposing you don't use a jetcan and so dock every time your hold is full). using stripminer i get more than 1400 m3 of ore for each stripminer every 3 minutes. so including the time spent docking and undocking i get 4.000+ m3 of ore every four minutes, i.e. 50.000 m3 in 50 minutes. veldsparhas a size of 0.1, so 50.000 m3 are 500.000 units and 333 units refine to 1.000 units of tritanium.that make 1.500.000 units of tritanium in 50 minutes.price currently is 3.80, so 5,7 millions hour.uninspiring (but you are using your hulk very badly) but way above your value."
12/9/2008,"lets look at your proposal.step one: lets see how the rewards percentage are split. the base is the average for the level 4 missions i have done after qr (a small number, but better than 1), using a 4 +18 amarr agent and a golem with almost max skills.mission reward 4,1%mission time bonus 4,1%lp 16,2%bounties 20,1%sellable loot 23, 4% (inclusive of all meta 1+ loot, trade goods, ecc.)minerals from recycling 20,7% (no drone missions in the sample)salvage 11,4%before qr the percentage in minerals was higher (30%), but as my post qr sample is a small group of mission and i had one dropping some noticeable good stuff it is possible that is only an effect of the random distribution of loot.but even using this set of number.you want to remove 20% of my rewards if exchange for:hypothesis 1: a slighty2 increase in bounties, maybe 5% = i.e. 20,1%*1,05=21,105% hypothesis 2: 10% increase in meta 16+ drops. even assuming that the price of meat 1+ will not drop, 23,4%*1,1=25,74%hypothesis 3: enhanced missions rewards by 50%. i.e. (4.1%+4.1%)*1.5= 12,3%so in hypothesis 1 you want to exchange the 20,7% in minerals with a 1% in iskiesso in hypothesis 2 you want to exchange the 20,7% in minerals with a 2,34% in meta 1+ lootso in hypothesis 3 you want to exchange the 20,7% in minerals with a 4,1% in iskiesall 3 hypothesis unbalance the current rapport of material to isk created in game from mission, moving it from the current: 28,3% isk, 16,2% lp and 55% materials to 36,4/20,2/43,4 in hypothesis 1, 34,6/19,8/45,6 in hypothesis 2, 38,7/19,5/41,8 in hypothesis 3. so all your hypothesis: reduce mission reward by at least 16% and unbalance the is/material introduced in the game, with a inflationary effect, magnified as people will be encouraged to run missions only for the isk. at the same time i strongly doubt that the total rewards for miners will increase, as the price of minerals will be still tied to the mineral basket, controlled by the insurance price of ships and not by the production of minerals. the only effect will be a shift in the value of the different minerals, with a possible increase in the value of mexallon and nocxium (dropped in abundance in missions) and maybe of tritanium, but compensated by a loss of value for the other minerals.mission rewards need to be looked, but, based on the above analysis, i think that a simple removal of meta 0 items is not the solution.to lavista vista comment: i would very much like to see a qen about mission and ratting effects on mineral production."
12/9/2008,"thank you all for your constructive criticism. due to the responses received, i have decided to delay this proposal until i can get with eyjog and discuss the effects and possible benefits. i will post my next idea in a subsequent thread."
12/9/2008,"well. how what is the possible benefits from removing something that isn't a large problem? i understand there's some issues that could be attributed to mission running, but that doesn't mean that mission running is the cause.i fully agree that we need to look into following problems:1. t1 module production is not worth a lot.2. there is no incentive to do mining because you can get minerals from doing missions.it could be argued that t1 module production isn't very good due to people; not game mechanics. people don't consider oppertunity cost, this is what causes this problem, not mission running. at least that's the conclusion i'm very much jumping to at this point, solely based on the, even if vague, claims dr. eyjog hinted at.as for mining, well. it kinda needs a complete over-haul. i think decreasing the barrier to entry for running large-scale mining operations could be of value. new hybrid ores should be provided in low-sec and 0.0. for instance, the tier 2 veldspar roid is very interesting.as i said, i ran for this very thing during last term, and i have a very supported thread on this exact issue for months. but while we can only speculate to this degree about it, i suggest we raise an issue for dr. eyjog to talk about the state of t1 production and mining as a profession."
12/9/2008,"while ships with a corp hangar can grant access to people in gang for example.how about the anchorable corp hangars?currently people anchor them and basically online them for half a second and then offline soon as they are done using the corp hangar.how about making it possible for those with the proper roles who can even use these corp hangars; could also change the access rights by default.corp hangars now require the role.corp hangars by default remain that way; but they have the following other options to grant access to.corp access: everyone in corp has access; take and give. no matter of role.alliance access: everyone in the alliance has access.public access: anyone who has the power to enter the bubble, can access the corp hangar.the only way to keep these settings will be to leave the corp hangar online.what this allows: it increases security a little bit with corp access. you dont quite trust the person with corp hangar access but u trust them enough for the anchored corp hangars. you can simply set the corp hangar thusly and things work out.alliance access means that perhaps logistics which can be done by many different corps but only 1 corp has the tower there as that jump between low sec,0.0 and homebase often not being direct single jumps. this allows all the alliance people to store fuel for their carriers-jump freighters in corp hangars along with drop off pos fuel along the way.public access means that even pos fuel delivery can be transacted direct drop off at the pos. or allow friends from different corps all around from real life to get together to do mining and drop off ore at the pos."

12/9/2008,we have never ransomed any member of any council for anything in any way. i'll ask you to back that up with at least a story. this is a game. act like it. play it. you are soapboxing about nothing.

12/9/2008,victim's recovery stages:1. denial: 2. shock & disbelief: 3. anger: 4. personal responsibility: i hope this is short enough for you to appreciate.
12/9/2008,"you're proposing two things i don't like. firstly, you're proposing that we take crafting away from the players. of course, for a lot of high-end stuff(officer gear, say), it's not in their hands, but ships above rookie level are all player-built. i like the depth of the market in eve, and i doubt that artificial collectibles will improve upon that. second, you're trying to actively promote deflation. in a lot of mmos that'd be good policy, but here it isn't, because eve is monetarily stable - the money supply increases somewhat slower than the goods supply, resulting in actual prolonged deflation over time. trying to speed up that process is a bad idea, because not only does it not need it, but you start running up against hard limits pretty quickly - the insurance scam wall on mineral prices, for example. those limits are unfortunately extremely prevalent in this game, so trying to kick over a stable market into volatility will result in you having a lot of trouble with them in very short order."
12/9/2008,"i'm not proposing anything, he asked for opinions.also inflation and deflation aren't really a problem. if you multiply everybody's isk by 2, then prices will just double, end of story.wealth disparity is a totally different ballgame. if nobody can offord said battleship or ammo but the fabulously wealthy then nobody but the fabulously wealthy are ever effected by it. their isk is deleted from the game, thus leveraging everyone elses's isk.this really doesn't cause deflation either as tech 1 and tech 2 producers and even faction gear providers don't really give a crap how much money donald trump has, they aren't gonna lower their prices just because he blew his fortune at a casino. its not like wealthy people in eve actually use their isk to invest as they're usually scams.why care about leveraging wealth? cause then maybe one day those tycoons might buy a tech 1 ship again and have it hurt them when it goes kaboom! i wouldn't really care either way, as it would never effect me. probably would never effect you either."
12/9/2008,"there are some things you could do with minerals too to keep it interesting. like making better versions of tech 1 whatever by using more minerals.maybe 5% more capacitor, 1% more powergrid, 1% more cpu, for using double the amount of minerals, up to 5x the amount of minerals.that could help eat up the mineral supply by allowing for luxury -by-mineral, and help stabilize the balance between buyer/seller markets."
12/9/2008,how about we just remove isk sinks completely then?

12/9/2008,"-piracy: add npc perks for pirates to compensate for my next suggestion. make antipiracy a viable *profession* through bounty system reform. pirates get more targets, maybe some cool stuff while the there's economic incentives for the anti-pirate good guy"
12/9/2008,"it's not that simple. money is neutral in the long run on the aggregate, yes, but you're implying that it's instantaneous and perfect. while the thought of that warms my monetarist heart, i know it's not the case. aside from menu costs(i.e., the fact that everyone would have to go out and re-post all their orders to make them line up with this new pricing scheme), there are still other barriers. the price of very cheap items on contract would not double, because the 10,000 contract fee would not double. the price of npc-sold goods would not double, meaning that a lot of things would be distorted - how much cheaper do supercaps get when their gargantuan bpo prices get cut in half? more critically, you're proposing deflation, not inflation, and the structural limits on mineral prices in this game start to kick in with much more vigor when your prices drop. if instead of doubling everyone's money you halved it, you would not lower ship prices more than a few percent, because you'd be self-destructing most of the accumulated ships in the game until mineral scarcity and monetary abundance rebalanced at ship prices being above insurance-scam levels. this is not a perfectly free economy, and when you go too far outside its comfort zone, it tends to fall apart because of limits imposed back when the game was new and its economy was less developed, which have not been removed to date. furthermore, your entire proposal was to cause deflation by launching an attack on wealth hoards. it was redistributionist in nature, but your method of doing so was to shrink the money supply by a huge amount. given that you seem to be advocating the neutrality of money while at the same time actively attempting to deflate the currency, i'd suggest that your rationale does not fit your proposed course of action. saying deflation doesn't matter while at the same time working to achieve it is nonsensical. i am hardly ""fabulously wealthy"", and i still manage to afford every battleship i want to get my hands on. aside from people who live to pvp(where you don't make money unless you're very, very good), or people who are just bad with money, i've never met any player more than a few months old for whom it was otherwise. you're right, i don't obsess over how much money the rich have, i just know that i have enough for what i need. the problem is, deflation doesn't affect one facet of the game, it tends to be pervasive, and pervasive deflation runs you headlong into the assorted nominal-value walls like insurance. and yes, that does affect you."
12/9/2008,"i found that really hard to read.i don't know where i proposed anything, especially not where i propose halving everyone's money supply i simply said inflation and deflation wouldn't be a problem for eve. if everyone's wealth is relatively the same, everything's cost would be relatively the same, with error on etched in stone prices.and no my proposition wasn't to cause deflation, nor redistribute wealth, but to offer a luxury-volume isk exit. thats not redistribution, thats flat out burned.as for why it wouldn't cause deflation, un-invested money is money that doesn't exist as far as player pricing is concerned.irl we care how much currency is flowing through the pipeline.if there is 10 trillion usd floating around it is a lot more valuable than if the government printed out another 20 trillion.in eve we don't care. lets say i hax ccp's megahertz and give myself 50 trillion isk. do you care? do people raise their prices? no, i'd have to distribute that through the pipeline of money for anybody to care. undistributed wealth is wealth that doesn't exist in eve. i could sit on unlimited isk and it would never matter unless i used it. like say, buying everything in jita at whatever price was asked.launching an attack on wealth? heh, thats a unique way to look at it. if your goal in eve is to just be rich, you simply never spend a red cent on the super-merchant. assault defended~"
12/9/2008,"i've made this point in other places, but i'll say it again here. looking at this meeting, i see issues getting a pretty small amount of discussion, and people complaining that it's taking too long. obviously, something isn't right here. we all want the csm to make informed decisions, and we can't expect them to spend an hour of meeting time per issue doing so. so why exactly are you guys discussing this in the meeting? all the policy disagreements(should ship fits be tradeable, things like that) should be hashed out in advance - you won't necessarily come to an agreement, but you'll know where everyone stands and why. you have a period of some days between an issue being placed on the agenda and it being voted on, so spend that time having some discussion on the topic. the meetings will go faster, communication will flow better, and decisions will be made in a more informed fashion."

12/9/2008,"i'm not trying to punish them electorally - really, i don't expect this to be much remembered in six months. also, i like most of the current reps. i'm trying to make the system work better. i didn't mean private forums, i meant public forums. the chatlogs are public, so there's nothing wrong with the policy discussions being public too. each topic has a thread on the assembly hall. talk there. even if you made it a suggestion that each rep respond to each issue thread once with their thoughts before the meeting started, that'd clean up quite a lot of it."
12/9/2008,"ok, thanks for rewording that. i agree that delegates should be showing a presence in each of the assembly hall threads. at the moment many threads have replies from only a handful of delegates.even if the idea is complete garbage, delegates should still add a few lines of their own opinion to give the authors feedback."

12/10/2008,"it's a strange dilemma.either no ccp employee knew about that bug.then you got to ask yourself why they 'have to play their game so that they know it'. it would mean that no ccp employee really knows the game as much as some (a lot?) of players do. questionable. alarming.or one or some or even all ccp employees knew about the bug. well.. in that case..i mean, it's not allowed to cheat and exploit. or is it? at least for a selected few?see what i mean?please shed some light on this issue."
12/10/2008,"time for the csm to earn their ""pay"". the csm was born from all the fallout of the last major dev/exploit/cheat incident. this is where you guys get to prove the worthiness of your existence.the csm job in this incident should act as an independent 3rd party to investigate these allegations and the depth & severity of this exploit. if you find yourselves unable to be ""independent"" enough to maintain credibility to your reports then find and appoint a person or organization that can fulfill the requirements of an independent 3rd party.you also have to act fast....probably faster than the csm's ""rules"" normally allows. at stake here is the csm's future and the possibility of a 2nd major crisis for ccp."

12/10/2008,"cyno jammers and bridges i wont touch, but what would be incredibly helpful generally is if jump bridges were two way streets not a highway network.limit them to 1 system so system x has a bridge that connects to system y and vice versa, not a network allowing caps and blobs from system a, b, c, d, e, f, g etc to get to system x with very little delay or heads up to the attackers."
12/10/2008,"first make a capital blob nerf. it is so hard to do anything against them ,if you dont have a similarly or larger cap fleet of your own. nerf carriers remote rep and make it possible to kill capitals in a capital blob with normal fleets aka bses."
12/10/2008,"as i sit here in the dark listening to my 2 year old daughter snore at 5 o'clock in the morning, i can't help but think that this is a well thought out and well implimented idea. i would like to however propose a counter idea as to why this change would be worse than the current system that is in place. as we all know, blob wars and blob tactics are extremely annoying to anyone, even the blobbers themselves. by lowering the stats as you've suggested, making guns weaker, cyno jammers more expensive, you'd actually be killing, the small group pos tactics all together and encouraging blob tactics. take for instance goonswarm, or bob, or iron, or any other of the large alliances capable of pos warfare in the first place. now take a small corporation of 20-30 guys, setting up a pos in 0.0 why would one of those major alliances send out a small fleet to remove a pos, when the can send a blob, and take out the pos, and the one at the next moon, and the next moon, and the next moon. granted you would make it so smaller corporations and alliances can ""attack"" another pos with victory as a possibility, but you then in turn eliminate thier ability to defend themselves against large scale threats, which then leads them to form larger corporations or alliances for protection, thus adding to the blob warfare you so say you are so sickened by.while you're ideas are nice, they hurt and help the little guy. always focus on the future outcome, not just the quick fix. and though i sincerly hate ccps logic with a passion, and it is not unknown how i feel about thier nerf bat, and lack of player interaction, the current pos warefare systems allows smaller groups to maintain a pos.""cause and effect""switzerland isn't invaded because everyone has a gun, (standard that all male citizens serve in the military, and when they leave they keep thier gun for civil defense.) however switzerland doesn't have enough people to invade anyone else! by making defenses weaker you encourage ""larger"" entities to come in. or if you don't like your poss you can always give them to me!"

12/10/2008,pretty much supported.
12/10/2008,agreed
12/10/2008,good idea
12/10/2008,^^ thishad some farmers recently operating out of a cloaked carrier in a deep safe spot and despite a number of efforts they are virtually impossible to catch i'm all for a bit of ninja ratting or plexing but for a group to be able to do this every day in the depths of enemy space with near 100% invulnerability is kinda wrong.
12/10/2008,"rat aggro w/o fixing cloaking means everyone will use the cloak if they already arnt, not a v good idea. all the ""cloaking's already nerfed arguments"" are sort of silly considering most of the draw backs they are mentioning only come into play once you're completly invulnerable. problems i see:1. cloaks are one size fits all, what cloaks my stealthbomber can cloak shrike's titan2. cloaking drawbacks on standard ships have detrimental effects to pvp but which do not translate to fighting npcs.3. non spec ops ships (cov ops, black ops, recons, etc. simply by saying anything that can use a black ops jump portal) can cloak indefinatly, from downtime to downtime if they wanted to.solutions that seem obvious:1. make ship-class sized cloaks.2. change the scan resolution delay to a rof penalty.3. as scagga mentioned, add a slight cap drain to cloaks and disable cap regen for cloaked ships.and while not directly related, getting rid of local and bacon cant hurt."
12/10/2008,noop should be shot/banned for using baconop should go back to wow if he want's to play an easier game.epic fail.learn to play the game and tackle and stop being a crybaby.bloody exploiters
12/10/2008,"this:""i disagree the problem isnt people cloaking its people being able to check local all the time, remove local and this whouldnt be a problem as a pilgrim whould ruin that raven pilots day.""nerfing cloak at the current state of power-block 0.0 reality would be plain wrong.cloaked carriers operating inside deep 0.0 ? very good. it just shows us clearly that no otherexistence in 0.0 is possible. either you have a 100 cap blob or you use cloaks to rat, do guerilla etc.""ratting raven, in our own space, alerted by bacon warps to safe, cloaks and smacks on local.

12/10/2008,daily bump. anyone else?
12/10/2008,"can see how it might be abused? like there is any doubt.let me correct your comment for you. it should read.""i can see exactly how this will be abused."""
12/10/2008,"it is a frontier, even if a half developed one.in a new frontier zone you can mine all the minerals you want (or drill your oil if it is present), you will still have smelters and maybe even refineries, especially if moving the oil is complicated. what you will not have is a clockwork producing firm, or a high precision medical instrument industry and tons of other specialty industries that will stay in the highly developed zones where expert manpower is plenty and demand for the products is high. so 0.0. alliances going back in empire for specific supplies (mostly those produced by npc today) is right, going back there for minerals less so. but keeping with the analogy, who will mine iron when he is in gold country? and changing iron so that is give as much profit as gold is a bit silly. a bit better in 0.0 than in high sec, ok, worth the same as mining a/b/c is excessive."
12/10/2008,"i'm not saying that this is the end-all of ideas, but it's a concept that needs refinement before it's game practical. given the wide variances in intake/output, the high-end ores would still be worth more than tritanium (even if we have to rebalance some ores), but not so in high-sec.at 2% yield in high-sec compared to 100% veld yield, veld is far more valuable. in null-sec, the objective is to make it about the same value, if slightly less, so that mining veld in mull-sec is considered viable, even if not preferred.i'm looking to give miners a reason to go into lower high-sec regions to mine the ores, and perhaps even *gasp* low-sec. if entire corps built themselves around patrolling and keeping one or two systems in low-sec, the pew-pew pvpers would have more targets, and the miners would have more options on profit potential.it needs work, but i still think the idea is valid. just keep in mind that i'm talking about yield, not amount of ore."
12/10/2008,"100% support, would be nice to have a paper rock scissors aspect to it to balance its defensive nature though:4 types of racial hacking, each of which could be tanked against but not all at the same time:->passive hacking (hacker gains access to the enemy network but does not affect the network in any way)->spam hacking (hacker introduces false positives and other confusing spam into the system)->jam hacking (hacker shuts down the defending network or reduces its level)->delay hacking (hacker slows down the speed at which the enemy system works)"
12/10/2008,"i'm reminded here of the ages of mud's where you had to check each room before you could see people in it, and use abilities to see through stealth and so forth. i'm having mixed feelings about your idea based on experiences with that."
12/10/2008,"when your ship gets damaged below 80% hull, it gains a burn trail. when this happens on my pc, my pc lags to a halt. i have to zoom out to maximum length to gain back any functionality. there should be a graphics option to turn off the burn trail (its not even a good graphic)."

12/10/2008,"i'll give ya a thumbs up, but i think you're concept is all wrong.to prevent skillpoints from turning into experience points (and to get rid of the omgitswow***gotry trolls) you need to get the idea out of your head that you get ""extra points"" for killing things or using modules.what this idea would have to be if it would be viable would be an very slight increase in sp an hour (100-ish), which would be equivalent to +1 to your stats while engaging in skills in that area. it's enough so that its not worth grinding for, and it actually slightly awards people who are actually online doing something.still, what makes eve great is i don't have to do anything and i advance. a better idea still would be to introduce +10 implants....mmmmmm"
12/10/2008,"supporting the discussion on this topic, i think the intention is good but the solution needs work.i've been thinking about this problem (i agree that it is a problem), but i haven't been able to come up with a solid solution yet either. we don't want grind and we don't want unemployed/basement kids getting advantages over everyone else. on the other hand it would be nice to see progression through play and, most importantly, skill. i like the get-skill-while-you-play systems (mining gives mining skill), but somehow the system should be dynamic enough not to be bottable. and if the skills are gained as prize of some competetive event, then the people with most skill already will likely win and get even more skill.just writing down what i'm thinking. i'd love to get around the table with some of ccps gamedesigners and talk about this."
12/10/2008,/facepalm
12/10/2008,"don't hate, its actually a good idea. i can't help it if my details are too advanced for most."
12/10/2008,"don't worry, i know what's in your head.getting this through the csm for discussion will be tricky though, as is writing the proper documents. getting things from my head onto paper is challenging, most of the time."
12/10/2008,"wtf? what the f***? this is a horrible idea, with 1/10 people responding giving it a thumbs up and you want to take it to ccp? what about the places with 50% approvals and up that csm doesn't seem to notice?as far as rewarding people for playing, i started eve with the idea that i'd be on equal ground as the 13-17y/o world of warcraft crowd that can devote 80 hours a week to gameplay.the problem is, as soon as you reward active gamers getting sp, you punish those who miss out.the difference, realistically, between a reward and a punishment is nothing. it all comes down to how you set somebody above others (reward) or set them below others (punish). but it's a 0 sum thing. if you reward action, you by necessity punish inaction. to make an economic example, if you give a 50% interest in the money in your isk bank in eve to anybody who plays over 30 hours a week, then you're not per se ""punishing"" those who play less. but it's going to be much, much harder for them to compete in markets with such an inflation in money, which will then drive everybody to get thsoe same rewards to stay on par. that's how we say that any reward will punish others. i'm getting punished because i fall behind others, even if the skill points per hour stays the same."
12/10/2008,"lol. i'm afraid you are correct, according to ccp it isn't stealing, just now.on your other comment.....when most peeps run missions they do salvage the wreckage left by the rats (i nearly said ""salvage their own wrecks"" doh!) but what is fun to you ie salvaging someone elses wrecks without permission, is a form of game-legal grieffing to other players. now everyone is well aware about the wasters who thrive on what they call ""carebear tears"", they get a great kick out of their gaming knowing that you are not enjoying what they are doing, it is unfortunate but that is the way the dev team seem to want eve to play out.i would like *gasp* closed missions....keep any sort of thieving away and let you get on with what you pay your monthly fee top do, that is play eve without grief from thieves and players who want any excuse to cause a pvp situation. if high sec players did want pvp they would venture into losec/nul sec and pvp until their hearts content.the way the game is going atm it's grieffers 1 : non grieffers : 0.soon going to be grieffers and....grieffers left to grieve with each other about ""the good old days, when you could get a good wind up from carebears""."
12/10/2008,"be nice to the op, you can't blame him for being a carebear!! not all of us can have my beautious security status! -6.60 i need to drop it another 0.06 anyways, ccp, make salvaging a wreck that doesn't belong to you an arggesive offense, and please, to keep wrecks from lasting in space for hours and hours so people can't just leave wrecks to aggro people, make thier time in spare 50% shorter. if you can't clear a room in a mission in 45 minutes and start looting/salvaging, you probably shouldn't be worrying about loot and salvage just yet!"
12/10/2008,"i'd love to engage these noobs in pvp. the problem is i am not allowed to because of this issue of them not being flagged for me to do so by their actions, aka stealing my salvage.they are cowards, exploiting. they're not doing anything in lowsec themselves because there they can *gasp* be retaliated upon.all we ask is for them to be flagged for stealing much in the same way they would if they were to directly take loot from the wreck. it is the same exact thing in the end.the people disagreeing are the very same cowards exploiting the mechanics."

12/10/2008,"yes, it is whiny, and has had countless threads already posted. please go back to farming missions and lagging up empire.also, i bolded your problem."
12/10/2008,"supported.the main use it would have is when you're trying to chase someone.the purpose of the 13.5 and 9 au warp speeds is to get ahead of something you're chasing.the idea is that the enemy ship manages to warp away, but because you warp so much faster, you actually drop out of warp before them. i've only had this happen on 50+ au warps, which are not very common.the ability to align faster makes no difference, you don't know where they're going until they've already warped, and then you lose more time finding where they went and clicking the button."
12/10/2008,"o.k., this one issue has really pickled my oats this week.our team entered a complex and right behind us came a group of pirates (yarr!). we didn't mind this, but they were at war with one of our team member's corp, so they open fired on our team member. in response, we defended our team member, and all of us got docked on our security status.i've read a couple of places where other folk are upset with neutrals being allowed to enter the battlefield (plexes), but i personally don't mind; they add a bit of fun and challenge to fw. the problem is that when they do enter the complex, they should no longer be allowed to hide behind their status.the complex did not form around them.the neutral, like everyone else, had to enter the plex through the acceleration gate.it is not right for us to get docked on our security status for defending a team member while in the midst of fw."

12/10/2008,"my issue here is faction war has enough problems already..... pirates excusing this for the ""normalcy"" of lowsec is not what i call a reasonable excuse here.course i'm just going to sit here and watch the you guys duke it out until i figure out pro's and cons."
12/10/2008,"war declarations are not against the entire fw alliance so there is no reason why you should get free kill rights on anyone that decs an fw corp. if you attack a neutral you lose sec, thats how it always works.if you wanted to help your fleet member you should have remote repped him, or just be happy taking the sec hit since that's how it works everywhere else."
12/10/2008,"corporation contracts & buy/sell orders should be controllable by any director/accountant/contract manager.it's just stupid that once a sell order it's set by someone from corp, that sell order cannot be modified by anyone except that person. if the contract/sell/buy order was set in the behalf of the corporation, ppl with right roles should be able to modify them."

12/10/2008,i think this is a very good idea the area of cammand ships needs some improvment and this would help
12/10/2008,no. simply because you suggest using an existing ship hull when we are in need of new ship hulls.
12/10/2008,if any ship hull needs to changed or a new one be done it's the moa. please for gods sake change that thing.
12/10/2008,"over the last five and a half years, eve has grown immensely, not only in terms of players, but also in terms of the numbers of corporations and alliances.this means that a typical corp will have hostile or friendly relationships with a far larger number of other entities than would have been the case when the game was launched.each corporation can only set standings towards a limited number of alliances, corporations and individuals. this limit is currently at three hundred, which, given the number of friendly and hostile relationships that a corporation might develop over its lifetime seem to be on the low side.now, the standings limit can in theory be increased by creating or joining an alliance, but this is not always practicable - for example when a corporation joins one of the faction warfare militias.therefore, i propose that the limit on standings slots be raised to five hundred."
12/10/2008,"is there any good reason why standings have limits? if there is, then no big deal, don't boost it. but i doubt that is true."
12/10/2008,"ccp said they would look into this, i don't remember the exact issue where this was brought up with. of course that was half a year ago... may be a good idea to poke them again about this.edit: looked up in minutes, was something that was brought up on the fly it seems as it doesn't have an issue id, and for some reason it was given a low priority..."
12/10/2008,"we need more ink for our ""enemy of the empire"" stamps."
12/10/2008,"this is likely due to a variable size ""maximum"" in the database datatype/variable.can be a tricky thing to fix.... but its doable.honestly there should be no limit.... but in reality there is always a physical limit in some form or manner when it comes to these things.but i support this none the less."
12/10/2008,supported. i've seen this as a problem in practice more than enough times.
12/10/2008,"more standings, yes.even better would be if we could ""import"" standings, or ""share"" them, so you can have the same standings set as another corp/alliance, but don't have to set them all by yourself(thus removing countless duplicates from the database)."
12/10/2008,"back when the csm's were first put together, one of the things they said they discussed at the iceland meetings was the ownership of pvp wrecks, (they should belong to the guys who makes them so vultures cant swipe loot without some type of penalty, being agroed to the guy in the pod isnt a penalty either)it even made the 'list' of things that ccp was going to address.. but it never happend.. what happend?"
12/10/2008,"ccp said they didn't see clear advantages of such as system, and that it would open a can of worms. the csm put it on the list of things to look at at medium-high priority. ccp said they would look at it though, but no promises were made."
12/10/2008,"if thets really ccp's answer to this problem then they need to be shown the folly of their ways. ""advantages'? making the wreck belong to the killer and the killed makes it so either party can defend vs loot thieves, hows that not an advantage?? 100% of eve would benifit from this at some point in their pewpew... csm's, it would be in any pvp'rs best intrest to have some rights to thier kill, wouldnt it?p.s. thx for the answer in any case csm"
12/10/2008,i'd be curious to see what this can of worms would be.
12/10/2008,more programming/less time swilling beer at 'the circus'
12/10/2008,"cirkus closed .but yes, ccp dropped the ball. they obviously didn't agree with what we said. such a shame"
12/10/2008,"perhaps if someone could provide some scientific evidence and documentation that could convince ccp, we could try again.details:"
12/10/2008,"it's not like there aren't a dozen ways to get past warp core stabs, from hics to simply overwhelming them. but abuse of a bad physics engine shouldn't be one of them.i'm all for letting some guy ram his ultra-expensive well fitted dart-shaped interceptor into my cargo hauler full of metal. but the result should be about what you'd expect.i've always been of the opinion that collisions in sci-fi games should be one of two scenarios. there's the privateer 2 method, where you bump together, the shipboard voice says ""impact"" and you drift away with nothing happening.the other is the privateer 1 system, having a sound like metal stressing and protesting, that makes you tighten up and you can feel your genitals trying to pull themselves into your body, and your undamaged heavy tank ship is now spinning off in the distance with no shielding and severe hull damage where the guy who dinged you at full speed in a small, agile ship is left a cloud of powder.if you want bumping to be effective, it should require something that fits the word ""ramming."" bumping, or nudging, or any other term meaning ""barely touch"" shouldn't trap a ship. it should require something that deserves the term ""collision."""
12/10/2008,amen
12/10/2008,"well if you want impacts then i want my missiles to be able to fly through your shields, same with projectiles and rail guns.in a sci-fi world where a shield deflects objects from colliding with your ship (missiles hitting your armor instead of your shields first) then ""bumping"" is a perfectly viable option, while not dazzeling, according to the rest of the sci-fi of eve, it works :-dyar biscuts for everyone!"
12/10/2008,"actually, lorentz (sp?) field effects would still protect the ship from low mass objects like missiles and projectiles simply by stopping them cold, whereas rail projectiles would be shifted away from the target. but something the size of a small ship would overwhelm the power generators for that same field effect pretty quickly. with a high enough em barrier even explosions would be shifted away from the target (or, rather, the mass within the explosion would be repulsed. without a matter cloud shockwaves cannot move in space... i.e. no damage).pushing 2 lorentz fields together, at whatever velocity, causes an amplification of the incident zone. as more force is built between the two fields the oscillation lines would eventually shift the lower mass object tangentally away from the larger mass (i.e. the interceptor should be sent spinning, not the massive industrial)."
12/10/2008,there's also the matter of velocity/kinetic energy.missiles/rockets are far slower than a projectile round....lasers are pure energy and travel at the speed of light.
12/10/2008,definitely needs to be toned down. why the heck can my frigate bump a carrier?!?
12/10/2008,fixedthatforyou
12/10/2008,nah bumping is fine and good for the gamehaul with something that can fit a cloak
12/10/2008,"but you don't see an issue with a ship colliding doing nothing, whereas a small piece of tungsten or lead does damage? logically, how do you justify that?i mean, do you even read these posts or just come in when you percieve an attack on a pirate traiditon going ""omfg carebear must punish anybody who wants to get in my way!""!!""!?!!!""read through my posts if you want to attack my stances on things. you keep trying to put words into my mouth and formulate these bizarre scenarios where i'm claiming things should be extra special for haulers. i'm not. i've never attacked hics, interceptors (outside of bumping), piracy, or gate camping. i'm complaining about one act that has no downside to the aggressor, no defense in a ship above a certain size/speed (12 seconds is the fastest you can reasonably align a deep space transport. that's with rigs and skills and full low sets, so it can do nothing else, and that's a long time to align) and is easy and undermines an entire class of starship."
12/10/2008,your wasting your breath on someone who has no discernment or care for rationality.: o )
12/10/2008,"one thing people are forgetting to factor in, aside from the avoidance systems, is that an object becomes more ""massive"" the faster it moves, its net force is a function of its acceleration x mass, just because a frigate is small doesnt mean its net force and relative mass dont increase with speed to equal that of an immobile or slow moving ship. additionally, because of the avoidance systems, the systems would start to read a much more massive object approaching on a collision course than the original mass of the object.. being fooled by the objects mass and acceleration it compensates for a larger mass instead of that of a small mass.. so it moves out of the way much farther in avoidance due to mass discrepancies in the sensors."
12/10/2008,"if you're going to quote science, at least know what you're talking about.ships get up to at most 10km/s. however, what your describing is a function that doesn't substantially occur until it gets to about 90% the speed of light.and with the force distinction, it's mv^2. so the velocity is doubly important. but the thing that discussions like your dismiss is the idea that there is a problem in the way things are handled."
12/10/2008,this ^^ use a scout or qq.
12/10/2008,"mr edwards, you're not very good at this game. not supported."
12/10/2008,how else do i get you to say foolish things?
12/10/2008,keep trying.you haven't done a very good job yet.
12/10/2008,i've noticed the turret size never changes size when you get a larger ship. i think it looks kinda weird when you supposedly have this huge cannon and all you have to show for it is this tiney little turret.
12/10/2008,i might misunderstand... but it is how it is...put miner 2s on a revelation. compare to the xl lasers.big difference. chribba has a pic somewhere :)
12/10/2008,maybe fit large cannons to bs? :d
12/10/2008,"the issue is that comparably it looks the same, which seems entirely appropriate. i fly an armor tanking dominix in missions, and have a small dual laser cannon. it looks laughably small on my ship, but it gets aggro just fine. large railguns look perfectly appropriate. so i think it's either a graphical bug, or you havn't compared things terribly well."
12/10/2008,"hello everyone, i was recently looking around on the eve store (i don't know if ideas for the store go here as well or not) but after i had stuff in my cart and was going to check out, i noticed that there were no shipping options to apo addresses.as a soldier who really really really loves this game, but deploys quite often, i would really like the option to have merchandise of my favorite game shipped to me no matter where i am in the world, i really wanted a model raven to brighten up my 6x8 room :-) i am sure other soldiers who love this game feel the same way :-) cheers :-)"
12/10/2008,"as an ex-brat(u.s. state dept) of an apo/fpo lifestyle, the ball is not really in ccp's court but in the hands of usps.now i do have a solution for you though, something that my folks have been using the last few years. they have had no problems with this service at all.p.s. thansk for your service.---editadded the p.s."
12/10/2008,everything in eve is player driven.... but starbase structures are seeded?sure it's a pretty big isk sink... but still?
12/10/2008,unseed skillbooks too! give me a titan skillbook bposome items in game would be far too expensive if not seeded npc wise.
12/10/2008,"i could see this being made into a reasonable proposal, but at present, it's clear you haven't given it more than ten seconds of thought. start considering the impact, and then come back here when you have a real proposal."
12/10/2008,^^
12/10/2008,"actually, i like this idea, but as has been said before this needs more work. what i would like to see though would be moon probe bpos."
12/10/2008,"hi, i live in canada where our dollar is worth 69 cents to the u.s. dollar. now i am paying almost 30 bucks for 1 damn month of eve. is there any way i can pay in iceland krona rather than u.s. as the krona is almost par with canadian dollar. there has to be some other way than using the much depreciated american dollar."
12/10/2008,uh..no...the price tag is going to be the same no matter where you go.what your feeling is exchange rates....just because it looks cheaper in one country doesn't mean its more expensive likewise elsewhere.its a matter of value of the dollar against something else.
12/10/2008,"exactly, lol, i know the price isn't gonna change and i am refering directly to teh exchange rates. there should be more options than just paying in us dollar, seeing as how it is an iceland company, i say paying in kronas would be an option, wich is 94 cents to teh canadian dollar, much more resonable than 69 cents...."
12/10/2008,your missing my point.your going to spend the same amount of money no matter what currency your using.the exchange rates are determined by your government.... ccp can't change that.what your proposing is likely cheating the system and illegal.and i'm quite sure ccp will say no.your wasting your time.
12/10/2008,"in euro it is 20 , so almost 30 us dollars. american citizens pay 20 usd. paying in us dollars is an advantage, not a drawback."
12/10/2008,uh no we don't.try 15.its 20 to activate a subscription.
12/10/2008,"as much as i would love this, i don't think that ccp is going to say much besides ""we're not going to discuss business/marketing."""
12/10/2008,"ccp is an international company, and a lot of their expenses aren't in krona - they don't buy servers in iceland, and they don't even keep them in iceland. and they certainly don't pay for the gobsmacking numbers of eve ads i see in krona. a lot of their staff is in reykjavik, but a whole lot is in london and atlanta too. furthermore, the krona is an absolutely terrible currency to pay in these days, since from what i've heard the primary forex market in krona is classified ads in reykjavik newspapers, ever since their banks imploded (and/or were taken down by gordon brown being a smacktard). surprisingly, their home currency isn't especially worthwhile for them. i'm a canadian too, and i'm feeling the pinch, but this isn't a viable proposal. even if they were willing to let you pay in alternate currencies, it'd be an amount pinned to a major currency by the current state of forex, not a nominal value that's free to float. if the canadian dollar goes down by a third, we get to pay a third more for everything foreign. it sucks, but there's not a whole lot we can do about it, or that we can expect anybody else to do about it. you can try writing a letter to the governor of the bank of canada, but don't expect much of a reaction. sorry."
12/10/2008,"you either meant to say depreciated canadian dollar, or appreciated american dollar.. otherwise it makes no sense.otherwise.. what everyone else said... paying in a different currency isnt going to save you money with the possible exception of their base rates of euro against the dollar, since every other currency would be charged the amount to be equal to one of those 2 rates.. you'll be paying 15 us dollars or 15 euros equivalent.that would mean you be paying your almost 30$ canadian dollar regardless of paying it in canadian dollars or us dollars."
12/10/2008,"if you are a non-corp member of factional warfare, and then you decide you want to make a factional warfare corp, you make a corp which ejects you from factional warfare, and then you have to wait 7 days for your corp to have standing so that you can rejoin factional warfare. there should be an option to start a factional warfare corp, rather than going through this whole ridiculous process."
12/10/2008,"worth considering, though i wouldn't be surprised if the negative consequences are determined to outweigh the positive."
12/10/2008,"agreed, you have to be vigilant - but the info window should really have the same behavior everywhere."
12/10/2008,is there a reason that i am missing as to why you cant put a med bay on a pos? if not can ccp look into it please. thanks
12/10/2008,uh because it would shift the balance of power in such a way that we would be able to deploy clone bays all over hell?are you on drugs or something?
12/10/2008,"it's one of those damned if you do...damned if you don't things. i'd think the evemail would be a bit more heavy then an api...depending on how many hits you allow per 24 hours.all this being said....i'm not they guy running 100+ pos. i think that us smaller guys would kinda let them set direction to a degree. personally i don't care how i get an ""alert"" or if i get one at all. i hang out near my pos so i tend to know the shape of it.and since you can't pop a properly setup pos in less then 24 hours....any serious corp should be able to check the state of their pos without an evemail."
12/10/2008,"i've never managed a pos myself, but from what i hear it's worse spam than your local v1agr@!!!! dealer. it's something absurd like three emails per fuel in the space of an hour, so you can easily get over a dozen mails in rapid succession. that's obscene, and it ought to be changed. as for notifications of attacks, there are some things a computer can reasonably do for you. an automated warning of ""i've taken a bit of damage"" is wholly reasonable. this is still a game, and making people do hourly patrols of a thousand towers is just not going to happen. that's not a game, that's a minimum-wage job without the wage."
12/10/2008,i.e a lot of boring work with no effect to punish those that have a pos?
12/10/2008,a perfect description.
12/10/2008,i support the removal of ded mails.
12/10/2008,that would only be very annoying but not serve the intended purpose.people would just be forced to look at that interface every few hours - but then the same blob would come to defend/repair the pos.i'm not sure yet if i like the idea. but the point would be the necessity to patrol your space. and because an alliance is likely to have many pos and some in outlying positions - the blob would have to split into smaller fleets.but i don't think it would work as intended. people woukld not really patrol that much - just have alts everywhere.it would more likely be seen as stupid super-boring grind.
12/10/2008,useless idea. it would just mean checking posses manually once or twice a day. easily doable for any properly organized corp. just more boring grind for no good reason.edit: those saying it would demand pos holding alliance to patrol posses... no it would not. in reality it would just mean logging in single low skills pos alt and checking posses one by one.
12/10/2008,"not a useless idea at all, and to be honest you wouldn't have to check the pos every few hours either. the main pos' likely to be attacked are high value moons plus with strontium timers etc you could easily get away with checking every couple of days. maybe ccp could increase strontium length by lets say 50% so alliances would only have to check pos' twice a week.the whole point behind this is to encourage smaller corps/alliances to have a crack at pos' they would never normally try for as there is no chance of success as it is now.the idea here is for towers to get slapped into reinforced and then be either saved if the owner is checking their assets or be destroyed if he isnt. dont forget also there is the opportunity here for the owner of the pos to completely tear a new one on the people attacking too, it's not all one way traffic here."
12/10/2008,"because of carriers uber remote rep abilities , it is nearly impossible to do anything against a large 30+ capital fleet without bringing your own 30+ capital fleet in. capital blobs cant be countered,only by another capital blob.this makes smaller alliances not able to compete in any way with larger alliances+blocks. even if you have 100+ ppl fleet with ordinary ships you wont be able to shoot even one capital ships from the blob,because it would get huge rep from the carriers. this clearly encourage to blob as much as you can with capitals and move them in one huge fleet instead of spread out them across your territory if there are multiple fronts.capital remote reps make station service shooting pointless , you need 100+ for hours just to be able to shot down those services and when you go sleep the enemy only needs to dock out some carriers withing dock range and afk rep those up possibly faster than you shot it down. same with pos repping , they just need to sit some meters away from force field and afk rep up guns other modules and the pos itself. if any threat comes they will just dock or approach the tower and they are in safe within seconsd.so therefore i propose to remove capital remote reps from the game. if you want to rep something use the logistics ships,thats why they are in the game.or make it that only triaged carriers can remote rep effectively, atm nobody use that module anyway, only on afk pos repping..."
12/10/2008,"larger groups will always whip smaller groups in capital fights, capital repping or not. nobody likes shooting station services anyway, so why encourage it? have you ever tried to rep a large faction pos with just logistics ships? the game is tedious enough as it is. not supported."
12/10/2008,"i wonder if that would still be effective, though. combat has slowed down a lot. hit and run tactics are more like hit, have a few martinis, chat for a bit, and stroll out in a pod. you know, unless you're in an interceptor and they don't have any warrior iis..."
12/10/2008,i'm sure my mocking you has indeed proved that you are an idiot.fakeedit: why did you need to edit one line?
12/10/2008,"updates made as per csm request - cache time was already listed in the spec, but the killmail api is already an hour so i don't propose changing that.ignition / hesod - this is an api change only - anyone using the client would see exactly the same functionality with this proposal1 exception - perhaps the corp mail kills in the client could run along the same lines, but i'm weary about the implentation of this, precisely for the reasons outlined by the csm. i also don't see the point - any use i can think of for needing it, the api would be better suited for anyway.edit for failspelling"
12/10/2008,"reading your posts give me a headache. i do not support your ""get rid of dds because i got uberpwned by one"" thread. and the whole ""get rid of dds"" is a stupid stupid idea. i'm willing to bet that 99.99% of all titan pilots right now didn't train all those skills to fly a logistical ship only. they wanted pew-pew and a titan should have a fair amount of it. removing a dd is dumb unless you come up with some other alternative to make titan pilots want to fly a titan. and besides, why pay all those billions of isk for a really really nice jump freighter/carrier....not smart investment. --isaac"
12/10/2008,"to be honest, there really isn't a problem with t1 logistics. they work fairly well as is and do not need buffs. t1 is supposed to be not as great as t2. quit being cheap and lazy and go t2.--isaac"

12/10/2008,holy ****.hardin was making a joke. darius was playing along with the joke.you have to be trolling. there is no freaking way someone is that thick.
12/10/2008,"not to belittle your point, but its not 2005-2006 anymore.these days, low ends are hoovered up by battleship and capital ship manufacturing in virtually all areas of 0.0. its a constant arms race even during peacetime. plus, iss was a fluke, or perhaps a moment of calm. peaceful areas of 0.0 where you might hypothetically be able to stockpile lowends are rare to nonexistant.additionally, the loot nerf of t1 mods being ginormous in size removes a lot of the source of those excess lowends--you can't rat for a day and melt down your takings into a few million trit anymore (unless you have a hauler following you).a dread requires over 100 million trit. a battleship: several million. a titan uses several billion units. however, trit is trit; barring alliance ops to suck up the belts it is still far and away more profitable to tap the high ends than veldspar, and people don't mine for free. so the lowends go relatively untouched.thus far ccp's efforts have been more to shove the square peg in the round hole; they nerfed carriers-as-cargoships, nerfed mineral compression, and introduced multi-billion isk ships to handle jump logistics. this still doesn't address the innate unprofitability of mining lowends and how its still cheaper to import than mine locally; they don't make mining lowends attractive, they've just been trying to make importation unnatractive.on top of that, a lot of 0.0 space is utter crap when it comes to ore types; most of the systems are functionally identical to lowsec aside from bubbles and rats. making the 0.0 lowends somehow more potent would go a great deal towards balancing their cost-effectiveness--it would offer incentives to mine instead of import. this would in turn starve the macrominers, which is what ccp would ideally want (or so they say; they do love those subscription $$ though).tl;dr: ccp needs to offer carrots, not sticks, to encourage nulsec lowend mining."
12/10/2008,"that was pretty much my point. that when there's an excess of minerals (even trit) and nobody there to capitalise on it, people do export. it's rare that those conditions actually happen now but if they do happen in the future, there's an established precident for assuming people will export. not that this is a bad thing, just that it has to be considered for the sake of argument and not dismissed as an impossibility.the tie-in i was trying to make with the high quality ore concept was that if we want to make local mining the primary source for minerals in 0.0, increasing the yield significantly is a start but logistics has to be considered at the same time. otherwise we could have another drone-region type fiasco on our hands."
12/10/2008,"i not really read the thread but if 0.0 wants higher quality low ends then empire want low quality high ends, give empire a chance to mine the good stuff abit lower quality and you can have veld at better quality, sounds fair to me !"
12/10/2008,"so what if we do?plus, i don't know if you can compare lowends to highends on an apples-to-apples basis, even with the drone regions.drone regions offered pre-compressed alloys that could be shipped to empire and reprocessed as-is. they offered increased amounts of high-ends that sold at thousands of isk per unit--definitely attractive.more potent ore would not be able to be shipped wholesale to empire in its native form. a rorqual would be required, and even then you could just not have compression bpos for it.low end minerals are bulky when you try to equal the value of high end exportation. it takes a whole charon to equal a bustard's worth of high ends. some exportation may happen, but it won't be near that of the local macrominers' output. drone regions and various alliance mining of abc allows mass importation of mega and zyd, and their level of importation directly controls the price since those minerals are all but unavailable in empire. trit, pyer, mex, iso, and even nocxium can all be acquired without leaving the umbrella of concord, so alliances and nulsec entities have far less control over their prices from a supply side of things (demand is another issue altogether).and even then...depressed lowends aren't a bad thing. it actually adds value to lowsec and nulsec. right now you can do just fine mining plagio and veld; mining lowsec is an interesting proposition but foolish. and as mentioned, most nulsec is barely better or equal to lowsec."
12/10/2008,"fair points. i concede on the point of exportation being a problem. what i'd love to see happen at some point is essentially that mining becomes the primary method of mineral acquisition in eve, not just in 0.0 but also lowsec and highsec."
12/10/2008,"so ank, i'm curious.you believe npc corps as war-proof umbrellas is a vital part of the game to protect players.i was hired by a victim against a corp of high sec suicide gankers: war dec them to stop their ganks and kill them.said gankers have left their corp to dodge the dec, making it much more difficult to stop them from praying on other players.how do you reconcile suicide gankers using the npc corp protection to further grief players in high sec, both player and npc corp alike, with your position that protection from war dec type conditions should always be available to players via npc corps to keep them from being griefed?"
12/10/2008,"when in iceland last time we (csm and ccp) discussed this and we came up with kicking criminals out of empire npc corps, into pirate faction npc corps where they could be attacked (to what degree, and if a wardec was needed was not yet determined). i agree with such consequences for people that abuse the privileges granted, criminal actions should always have consequences."
12/10/2008,"but this is a game and that is an extremist view on punishing, what you consider to be, misbehavior in a videogame.at what point do we decide to just delete an ebil piwate's character for doing what the game encourages?a bandaid will not fix eve's law and order systems, gotta amputate and start over."
12/10/2008,i gotta go with issler on this one. we (used loosley) complain that eve is to carebear...removal of npc goods may (i'd like to see a study from ccp) make it even more so.
12/10/2008,"apologies, i forgot to close a tag. it's fixed. problem is, those etched prices are a big, big part of this game's economy. if it was just low-end skill books i wouldn't care, but it's everything from pos towers and fuel to bpos to insurance. this game requires a stable monetary system, at least until they make some pretty major changes, and your proposal would threaten that. also, why do you object so strongly to the word ""proposal""? it seems an accurate descriptor. i'm not claiming you'd gamble your firstborn on the concept, but you were the one who brought it up. if you can show me that these items will never be bought except with idle cash, then i'd accept your proposition that they are not deflationary. however, that's a ludicrous suggestion to make. sure, the trader with 100 billion in his wallet who uses money as a way of keeping score might be choosing between sitting on it or buying himself a hangar queen, but i expect their use to be more strongly geared towards collectors and rich missioners at first, followed by the hardcore pvpers(likely gtc-funded) and the somewhat less rich missioners. none of those people sit on wealth, they just have it. pulling money out of their wallet is deflationary. unless you propose making your proposal explicitly elitist - i.e., you can't buy one unless you've had these billions in your wallet for at least 6 months - this will be a large deflationary change. i also don't know why you draw a distinction between rl and eve in this regard - if the us government put that 20 trillion in fort knox, nobody would care. it's when it enters the economy that it matters. it's somewhat harder to keep money out of the rl economy than the eve economy, given that people are lazier in a game(and don't have to plan for their retirement), but the principle is the same. the only difference is, nobody keeps m0/m1/m2/m3 stats on the eve universe(with one qen as an exception), so it's easier to hide the money's existence in game."
12/10/2008,"as any economist can tell you, a higher money supply does not necessarily lead to inflation. the definition of inflation specifies the general increase of prices.a general and relatively equal increase in everyone's isk supply would almost assuredly cause inflation. a huge isk increase into a select few elite players' wallets is not the same and is exactly the reason why even a double money supply does not necessarily cause inflation.the exact opposite is true about deflation.i'm not making a proposal to be voted on.and the burden of proof for a luxury isk exit causing deflation is on you. this idea that only idle cash can be removed from system without risking deflation is what is the ludicrous suggestion.and about why i draw a distinction between irl and eve on the topic of money supply and inflation/deflation, where to begin?isk is printed everytime you blow up an npc ship or do a mission. hundreds of billions of isk enter the system every day.the only thing preventing lowering this massive, unregulated printing of currency every day are massive isk sinks.why inflation/deflation are different irl/eve, cause if the price of items goes down due to fewer isk being available, players simply pump more isk into the system and pump less out.eve's economy is so much simpler than rl, theres no comparison."
12/10/2008,"i know very well what economists will say, i am an economist. and i'm telling you that your economic model is simplistic and inaccurate, and that your proposal(whether it's being voted on or not) would lead to some nasty secondary effects. do you really expect that people will sit on large quantities of money for extended periods of time? yeah, there are a few who do, but most people either use their wallets in some fashion, and most of those who sit on it won't break open their wallet for luxuries like overpriced uberbattleships. so if the money being spent on these wasn't idle - say, they would have bought an outpost if they didn't pick up these battleships - then the option of purchasing these new goods drives down aggregate demand for the old goods, thus lowering the supply/demand equilibrium point. prices going down is the definition of deflation, and the eve economy is big enough that the effect will be general, since there'll be someone whose demand has been redirected away from any given good by this process. and money is printed all the time irl too - you ever looked at a money supply curve? they use a more complex process than just giving it to people, but the effect is the same. inflation is zero when the money supply increases as fast as the goods supply - money grows a bit faster irl and a bit slower in eve, but the effect is clear in both, and both are fairly well balanced."
12/10/2008,"i'm not bothered by secondary effects. nasty secondary effects, attacking wealth hoards.. i don't have such a dramatic view on lowering a money supply. and still its not deflation.all true.wrong. deflation is when the general level of prices go down, and there is nothing that should lead me to believe that by richie rich not buying outposts with his non-idle cash, that the effect is so resounding that it would cause deflation.thats a far stretch, quite a reach.and i think you're making too much of idle money tbh.its not like players are investing their isk in spider funds every minute that they aren't spending it, and then sell stock whenever they go to buy ammo. the individual's spending habits have indirect effect on everything. but the degrees of separation between richie rich's cause and the rest of eve's effect are so numerous and dissipated that i simply don't believe that a segmented few wealthy players can cause deflation by not spending their money."
12/10/2008,"i will always maintain that mission fit or however fit. if you put yourself in a lowsec space. or you gain agression in highsec space then you have opened yourself up to any form of pvp that another player chooses to bring down on you.we shall not turn into pvp battleground areas, where people can print their isk at 0 risk outside of those bounds.the bounty system needs an overhaul. to what... taht im unsure of.piracy continues to be nerfed at almost every patch... eventually this playstyle will be nerfd to oblivion to the point it does become carbear online. im not saying overturn anything that has been put in place. i believe the sentry guns in low sec are needed, but i do not think buffing them anymore than what they are. scamming is a legit way in eve, and if your too ******ed to see whats being sold then you deserve to loose your isk.thats my take on piracy. anti-pirates are always welcome to wardec so complaints about anti-pirates having it rough is ******ed, since now you want to grief them when they might not want it... which is techincally pirating ;-p"
12/10/2008,"you're not bothered by the consequences of your proposals, and you refuse to acknowledge economic reality. brilliant. you ever looked at what ""outpost materials"" consist of? plenty of things, but there's about 50 battleships worth of minerals in there. if those minerals don't get bought, then the prices of minerals goes down due to the slackening of demand. it's a small effect if it happens once, but if it happens every time then it starts to add up. and yes, that's deflationary. let's say 50 get bought at 20 billion a pop. the money supply thereby goes down by a trillion, or about 1%. now what would that trillion have been spent on had these ships not existed(i.e., the status quo)? some would buy officer gear, some would buy outposts or supercaps, some would get some bpos as investments, some would buy characters(whose sellers would then buy more mundane things like battleships), some would use the money to play in the market - basically, the money would be spent on other sectors of the economy. since that money is no longer being spent there, the equilibrium between money and goods goes down, which is a price drop, which is the definition of deflation. it might not affect all sectors of the economy equally(though given that the people you just bought off will probably spend money themselves, it should even out well enough), but it will be deflationary. the only way to avoid this is if the effective money supply(money times velocity) does not go down - i.e., either buying these ships makes people spend money faster, which is incredibly unlikely - or it's a movement of money that would otherwise have had velocity zero - i.e., money that would not have otherwise been spent. if the money going away is idle money, then it will not be deflationary, but otherwise it will. and if i believed that only ""richie rich"" would be purchasing these ships, i might accept your rationale. however, i don't believe that for a second, and thus i'd prefer to look at economic reality rather than classist fantasy. they'll be purchased by a wide spectrum of players with a wide spectrum of opportunity costs, and the economic effects will be equally wide. there is no conceivable way of removing money from the economy that will not have a net deflationary effect. that effect may be large or small, balanced or focused, but it will be real. since the entire function of your proposal seems to be large amounts of deflation(whether you understand the effects of it or not), it would be unreasonable to not consider what impact those effects would have. i have considered them, and i'm pretty sure they would be bad, or at best worthless. that's not exactly a ringing endorsement."
12/10/2008,related to trading/markets: the pos production issue needs a more detailed disclosure:
12/10/2008,"it's useless to speculate about the follow-on effects until we know the scope of the problem. i hope they've got somebody looking at databases to check out how widespread this was. if they do, and it was like 1% of the market, no big deal, ban and move on. if it was 50%, it's a bit of a different story, and i don't know what the proper reaction would be."
12/10/2008,"100% support, would be nice to have a paper rock scissors aspect to it to balance its defensive nature though:4 types of racial hacking, each of which could be tanked against but not all at the same time:->passive hacking (hacker gains access to the enemy network but does not affect the network in any way)->spam hacking (hacker introduces false positives and other confusing spam into the system)->jam hacking (hacker shuts down the defending network or reduces its level)->delay hacking (hacker slows down the speed at which the enemy system works)"
12/10/2008,"i'm reminded here of the ages of mud's where you had to check each room before you could see people in it, and use abilities to see through stealth and so forth. i'm having mixed feelings about your idea based on experiences with that."
12/11/2008,i agree entirely.
12/11/2008,"true, so annoying if some ninja-looting bastard is stealing your hard earned loot.let me kill that bugger if he thinks it's a good idea to benefit from others work."
12/11/2008,yeah i suport this :)
12/11/2008,"now with the severe penatlys for ganking anyone in low sec or hi sec, poping a vulture who just stole your hard earned loot isnt really an option anymore. its still a case of zero risk for huge rewards to loot thieves as the current 'owner' of the wreck is well... usually in a pod. so.. to make sure im perfectly clear, this is not about hi/low sec ganking, its about war, and the victors spoils. this should be a no brainer for ccp to implement. who gives a rats ass about walking in a feakin station?? this is a pvp game, work on pvp stuff, not fluff"
12/11/2008,"it should be like this by now (correct me if i'm wrong):suicide ganker kills industrial. wreck is owned by victim. corpmate from suicide gankers loot the wreck and get flagged for the victim's corp. victim's corp mates kill looter.changing the system to dual ownership would mean:suicide ganker kills industrial. wreck is owned by suicide ganker as well as victim. suicide ganker's corpmate may loot the wreck, will not get flagged, and will not get attackable for victim's corp. defending their property would immediatelly flag the victim's corpmates and concord would kill them.no, not really a good idea... needs changes concerning the victim / ganker thing."
12/11/2008,"this is not about suicide ganking, its about war. suicide ganking has its 'regulations'and balance built into it, huge sec hits and very fast concord responce. keep on topic, again, this is about pvp, war, not high sec ganking. whole different topic"
12/11/2008,"this is about a change in the game mechanics, and it would have an impact on suicide gankers - no matter whether you want to hear it or not. you cannot fix it for war without having it affect the suicide gankers as well. so you keep thinking about the consequences outside your focus."
12/11/2008,"i never suggested that the killers corp gets rights, just the killer.. so your suicide gank worries are not valid... killer would be in a pod, the 'deads'corpm8s could take vengance out on whoever takes loot in that case.. problem solved.. ccp, make it so.. go!"
12/11/2008,"ok, if it could be implemented like this, it would work. but ""dual ownership"" as mentioned in the starter post would mean that also corp mates would get ""rights"" - corp mates can have a look inside my cans without being flagged for anyone - and that would be a problem :)"
12/11/2008,"in any case it needs to be looked at, maybe if the 'killer' took a sec hit to make the kill, duel ownership wont apply.. if the killer killed you without taking a sec hit, war dec, or 0.0 youd get duel ownership. we have all killed targets in 0.0 to have vultures snag loot then jump the gate back into hi sec and laugh, how kool would it be to follow then in and have 15 min to kill their punk ass's?"
12/11/2008,now that sounds like a deal :) with the sec. hit check it would be possible to make it effect only war and 0.0 - this way i would support it ;)
12/11/2008,i support this proposal

12/11/2008,agreed and supported. i've read the allegations from one particular anonymous apparently banned player on shc - i would appreciate the csm's input in clearing the air and restoring confidence in the wake of these rumours and uncertainty. i do think its too early to judge and certainly we can't automatically trust anonymous people trumpeting their own wrongdoings - but this is a serious allegation and we do need it investigated and this was certainly one of the jobs that the csm was invented to do.
12/11/2008,"the 4 big power blocks always appeared to have absurd amounts of isk for supercaps - the same supercaps with which they have taken and defended space. should it transpire that the scale of this exploit is as astronomical (4 years and and literally thousands of trillions of isk) then there is clearly only one solution, that every alliance that has exploited this be removed of every single control tower after tomorrows downtime. start again and see how it works out without the support of an exploit."

12/11/2008,"i can't begin to guess what the csm can do but i have started a thread with the current csm about our reaction and a call to consider what we might do to represent the pilots of eve in helping understand the extent of the exploit and the actual ccp response once it was reveiled.that said, someone once gave me a quote that went something like ""never assume an act to be maliciousness when stupidity is a possibility"". i expect i mangled the quote but i think the sentiment is valid. let's not assume that all of ccp is bed with a certain set of big alliances when this could have been a simple oversite, a break down in process or if a deliberate act, that of a one or a small number of individuals.so for now, let's put away boiling oil and pitchforks and hope that ccp can provide whatever information required to let the pilots of eve feel comfortable that their concerns are being addressed.as for the csm, i can assure you everyone in the csm wants a fair eve for all and if there is anything we can do to help put this situation to rest we will.issler"

12/11/2008,#NAME?
12/11/2008,"first, this needs to be addressed by the csm to ccp. it's what the csm is there for, and this is your opportunity to show us the system works, and is not just one massive pr stunt without any real teeth.second, ccp is going to claim their privacy policy preventing them from releasing account details.that's fine. i don't care about the names, addresses and credit card numbers that are legally protected by the privacy policies and legal ""coveryourbut"" of ccp.what i am interested in knowing, however, is how many towers, belonging to how many alliances, for how long, what their economic impact has been, and what steps are being taken to fix the problem.i will say one more thing.""removing the assets from the players that cheated"" is not enough. having a banned account have a -400,000,000,000 isk balance does nothing to fix the problem. they still had a massive advantage over the rest of the playerbase, affected the market, and destabilized the economy. simply removing ""$x"" isk is not a solution.so the second thing i want to know, is how is ccp addressing the current situation and how do they plan to maintain the health of the eve economy after this."
12/11/2008,"well, this is obviously a very important issue to you guys. if we can, i will try to make sure it is raised.but i don't want to promise anything. ccp doesn't discuss exploits at all. nobody could discuss the damage without telling what the actual exploit is and things like that. so it seems really unlikely to me.we should try however."
12/11/2008,"now this is something where the csm can actually show what it is worth and do what it is meant to do, something different then discussing musical instruments in ambulation if the csm does not get to investigate this matter on behalf of the players it is only a farce/marketing trick and should be dissolved as it serves no real purpose imho."

12/11/2008,a vote for transparency.
12/11/2008,"well. first of all, i kicked off this process. please understand that ccp does not want to discuss exploits under any circumstances, not even with the csm.however, i have pushed for ccp to work with us on resolving any issues the community might have, together with us. it's beneficial to everybody, so it's worth doing.i will however have to ask everybody to manage their expectations. please don't expect anything. ccp's stance is clear at this point. we might be able to work something out with them so we can make more people happy. any direct information, names, numbers of titan and what not people have requested, i will personally be very much against that ccp discloses. it's unreasonable to expect and it will *not* help anything to the situation. it will only serve the people who wants to create drama in the forum."
12/11/2008,"good work lavista. you deserved your second term indeed.ccp would immediately dive for their ""non-disclosure of account holder information"" line in their eula anyway, so its highly suspect they'll even think of releasing objective information as to who/what/how many benefitted from the exploit."
12/11/2008,"i'm surprised the thread is still working and not experiencing technical difficulties as when they announced they just figured out ghost training existed and decided to remove it, but yet again not as many care about this compared to that as was evident on the hundreds of pages of responses. in the end don't depend on ccp to help you in any way, shape or form so you're better off just taking advantage of what you can. it's not like they haven't helped their friends or anyone in-game before right? *cough* band of brothers *ahem* why bother if ccp acts innocent like this, they obviously aren't trying hard to come forth with everything if it took over 4 years to find just this exploit."
12/11/2008,"this really needs to be looked at, and a full report on the extent of the damage to the game in general needs to be published.this bring up way to many questions to ask, and it's important that ccp is seen to do the correct thing, and come clean."
12/11/2008,"i appreciate the fact that ccp is reluctant to give details about specific characters/accounts and in reality cannot say which titans and outposts were built with isk from the exploit. however, there needs to be a thorough investigation of the scope and range of the exploits abuse.we need to know if this was a multi-year, multi-trillion isk disaster and if so we need to know what level of involvement each alliance had and what actions are being taken against them. without that being a completely transparent process we will never see the end of favoritism accusations and rightfully so. to this day alliances and ccp are demonized over what may have been the comparatively trivial t20 incident. unless ccp wants to see that x20 they need to make the investigation of this exploit and its consequences transparent to at least the csm and to a lesser extent, the public.i hope this exploit was never widely used and has had a trivial impact but if it is anything near what the accusations claim it is then we need a full and transparent investigation. i know that is not ccp's policy to do such things publicly but this situation is utterly without precedent and should be treated accordingly. this exploit may well have reshaped 0.0 and something of that magnitude cannot be dealt with quietly behind closed doors."

12/11/2008,"a resolution:the system by which t2 goods are introduced into eve online has become the basis for two major scandals. it seems evident that the t2 system, as currently implemented is corrupt and taints and taints all that it touches. it is therefore resolved that the system should be scrapped in order to dismantle the current t2 system, t2 bpos should be available through the various lp stores either for research points, lps or some combination thereof, in quantities only limited by their lp cost.all t2 components should be buildable either from moon minerals or from items available by means that can not be controlled by any one person of group (for example either from common minerals or from items found in exploration sites).ccp should adopt the policy that when an item is intended for common use amongst the player base the means and components if its manufacture shall be available in such a way that a hard limit does not exist on participation in the process. we have seen scandals arise both from the ownership of t2 bpos (a limited process) and the production of t2 components (limited by moon availability). it seems self evident that, as long as a player controllable bottleneck exists on the process, scandals will continue to occur."
12/11/2008,and create a bigger scandal by turning the entire system upside down...no
12/11/2008,"i would, instead of complicating the system with a queue, just like a skill ton continue training once a level is achieved. this will eliminate most of the problems with poorly times skill completions, as this is usually the lvl 3&4 groups. this would be a relatively simple change, that would probably only require minor code changes.when we choose what to train, we select 'train skill', not 'train skill to next level'."
12/11/2008,the coding argument so many developers use as an excuse is complete *******s a lot of the time. if they can find the time for all the expansion programming they do all the time i'm sure they can find the time to code a skill queue. but i'm sure some will say it's not that simple and that ccp is doing all in their power to fit us with a queue
12/11/2008,"aye. totally wrong. loging in for skill changing is like:""hy peeps, just in for changing skill. cu later..."" *logs off after 5 seconds*so hell, give us that splitted skill queue with one long time and one short time skill to be set."

12/11/2008,"i see lots of babies throwing fits because a single person is in their system they're too noob to hunt down.the problem isn't with cloaking, seeing as you take a huge hit on having one installed, it's with you."
12/11/2008,"if they bring the nano back, who care about cloak ****t"
12/11/2008,"let me see if i get what you are trying to say.depending on where you are you get different things out of a ""rock""leaving the rocks alone and where they are but adjusting what they yeild.. using the bistot example.. it has a high amount of zydrine in it.. which is warranted in 0.0 because of the risk involved.. now if you added zydrine into some high sec ores you could do it this way... where bistot gives you a couple of hundred, a high sec ore would give you.. say 1-2this could be done with the high end minerals on a scale based upon value.. people won't get rich by any means but at the same time.. you could get ""some"" maybe over time enough to build that fancy battleship.. its throwing high sec miners a bone.. but not giving them the cow.. tie the mineral to the ore.. and to the sec status of the system.. .8-1.0 nothing special .5-.7 maybe find a little sumthin sumpthin in your batch.. not much .. but a little bit.. that is how you keep it from over balancing.. people will still buy high end ores for ""power building"" but the little guy over time will be able to get enough to buidl a bigger ship without having to buy... that is how i see something like this working.wnx protagonistbrig general north american gamingwarrior nation"
12/11/2008,"poor idea, indeed what we should neeed is a less even distribution on ores across the whole universe imo. but for that the quantity of mineral needed to produce each item would have to be tweaked taking into account yield per hour, etc."

12/11/2008,"if the pos exploit was on the scale that is being talked about, then please start a new server where honest players stand a chance of achieving something in 0.0 space"
12/11/2008,"*sigh* no.eve was, is, and will always be (barring local laws forbidding it) a single world-wide server.even if the scale of cheating was the same order of magnitude some guys of the tinfoilhat brigade are shouting around, most major alliances have been allegedly using it, so in the grand scheme of things, it means next to nothing... also, 0.0 is such a volatile area that not before long any advantage they might have had ends up meaning next to nothing.""honest"" players (whatever your definition of honest might be, it certainly will include or imply ""small numbers of tight-knit friends"") will seldom ever have a serious chance of making it into 0.0, with or without cheating on anybody's part - join one of the greater powerblocks or stand aside. and since all larger powers have been doing it... yeah, you get the idea.or maybe you don't, but that's not my problem.thumbs down, way down."
12/11/2008,sharding in my eve? i say no no no.
12/11/2008,./signed getting sick of assh0les cheating their way for 4 years.
12/11/2008,"i think the beauty of eve would be that due to the sandbox nature, they can and will recover from it.you'll figure out who the alliances are when if they are active pvpers they don't suddenly resurge with massive capitals again after they lose some it'll be pretty obvious if anyone was majorly profiting from it.i'm willing to bet it was more rlmt isk farming operations, not the massive conspiracy you think it is."
12/11/2008,the worst case scenario is that eve is irretrievably broken.start up a duplicate server with no game time cards and more rigourous prosecution of isk sellers and no t2 bpos and i'll give up all my skill points and assets and transfer there in a heartbeat.
12/11/2008,and no alts.
12/11/2008,1
12/11/2008,"f*ck no.also, eve is not broken, it's just going to change. i remember when only the most elite and rich players could even afford to use t2 on pvp ships. we're just gonna see more of people doing the best with what they've got. also, i predict some severe 0.0 shakeup but we'll see. if it happens it will be good for everyone except the guilty."
12/11/2008,"if ccp can't stop the exploit on the current servers, how would they be able to stop it on the new servers ?if ccp can stop the exploit on the current servers, what would be the point of the new servers ?"
12/11/2008,no
12/11/2008,"how will adding another server change anything? i would love to hear how you intend to keep dishonest players out in short, no.."
12/11/2008,"i hope you are right, and it really depends how numerous the guilty are and how much damage they did (i.e what the worst case scenario is). i used t2 stuff on my ships but it hurt like hell to lose it a few years ago and i'ii admit i did envy those guys who had so much money it did not hurt them - back then the big money came from t2 sales and i just thought those guys had been lucky with the lottery or astute businessmen. i'll just give my reason for saying the game may be broken. it's not because i worry about t2 goods going up in price or getting more expensive, or changes in the 0.0 power-blocks. it will be a broken game if use of the exploit was significant and did generate really huge amounts of isk (as ccps own post suggests)over 4 years, because in that event all that time all that isk was used to concentrate wealth (aka power) in fewer hands than would otherwise have been the case i.e. purchasing t2 bpos (then building cap fleets to help win 0.0 resorces, but thats more recent and will as you say be corrected over time). that would break the game for everyone trying to compete with that accumulated wealth by whatever means. maybe the same people/powerblocks would have achieved all that they that have without using the free isk exploit anyway (like bob did not need t20s few bps to get rich), but thats something we don't know and we can't put things back the way they were 4 years ago, to find out. if this pos isk exploit is really serious, added to the other flaws in the game it pushes it over the edge in favour of starting afresh for me (not that i'm holding my breath for that to happen)"
12/11/2008,"seven corporations, three of them were in one of two alliances.there are an absurd number of alliances in this game (take a look at eve-maps to verify this statement). there will be a period of market instability, but it will recover as more people adapt and use alchemy on a larger scale."
12/11/2008,"lots of free income = lots of extra expenditure. they will now lose that income and not be able to spend as much / have a equally high upkeep for a prolonged period of time. however, this could ofcourse take a bleeeeeding long time, but i believe that sharding is fail, and rather take my chances with the system slowly bleeding into the shape it should be rather than mucking everything up."
12/11/2008,how the hell will this change anything?no!
12/11/2008,"the idea is sound, but the details would indeed need to nailed down so as to prevent macroing/botting. if the bonus is specific to the activity, than i don't see a real problem with this. and before you say gb2wow, i have never played warcrud and never will.as i am a casual player, i am able to get to where i want already. a little something to encourage me to keep playing would be a good thing.so long as the bonus is minimal, i have no objections to this.i will wait to see if the details get hammered out before flagging it."
12/11/2008,"if ccp does anything with the skill system, i would like to see a skill queue up to a certain amount of time ot certain number of skills (not to long, not to many) as the majority of this thread has pointed out, even a small increase in sp by playing will give players who do nothing but play eve an advantage over those of us who work. what about soldiers like me who deploy for a year or more? their will be a major sp gap between myself and my former peers as they have been able to play the year while i have not.if you want ccp to buff the sp/hour rate then try to get ccp to add a higher set of implants or another learning skill or something that everyone can take part in, not just macros and people who don't take part in rl very often."
12/11/2008,"as a new(ish)player that has lived in 0.0 from day 5 of trial i can honestly say that there is currently a ""skill up as you play"" system.every moment flown in 0.0 is a learning experience, and develops my awareness of threat, risk and means to counter them. skills and experience are never simply a game mechanic. sure enough every now and again you get a new toy, but the good sense to use it correctly can never be developed through points.eve already has enough grind, isk for ship losses and skills and fittings and etc, loyalty points for more. adding another ""reward"" element that encourages grind would not be good.slow down, immerse yourself, and enjoy learning to fly what you have. eve is a steadily paced game, i very much enjoy it for that.and, if you are bored running missions, take a risk, get out to 0.0 and join in the fun."
12/11/2008,"i think i'm going to have to invoke samir nagheenanajar here:""yes, this is horrible, this idea."""
12/11/2008,nothe skill-system is fine as it is - only thing missind is a back-up skill-queue.
12/11/2008,"this was actually the original system of eve's skill training, allowing both the time lapse and usage of the skills mentioned to increase their respective sp count.it lead to massive abuse early on and was basically removed and replaced with the current system we have now.so no."
12/11/2008,my specific details do not allow for abuse.the details are everything.
12/11/2008,"needlessly complicated, completely contrary to the core concept of eve, doesn't really add anything at all to the game and makes active play basically mandatory for fast progression... basically a huge thumbs down.if you want sp for actions, get enough isk and buy an older character."
12/11/2008,"that idea is lame, that would make eve like wow. the way of skilling in eve is what makes it so different from other mmo's."
12/11/2008,no way... the skill system is one of the very nice done mechanics in eve that makes eve unique after all..
12/11/2008,no! go back to wow !p.s. can i have ure stuff?
12/11/2008,"ok i'm sorry i was intentionally being mean in the last two posts but heh you stop caring as the approval rating goes down. lets imagine that i'm eating an apple pie and its too runny.i write a proposal to have the next pie be less runny.it is a forum poster's nature to assume the worst possible implementation of this proposal.oh holy christ no! don't make it less runny, ffs i don't want to eat sandpaper i want to eat pie!even if i included within the proposal specific details that would ensure the next pie would not be dry or like eating sandpaper, most forum posters wouldn't care or even bother to read that.even if i repeated and emboldened those details.even if i added a goal that specifically stated that i would not want the pie to resemble sandpaper, highlighted that statement in a different color, and underlined it, most forum posters would still ignore it, repeat their fellow man in having no desire to eat sandpaper, and tell me to go back to the desert."
12/11/2008,"sorry about the alt fast reply(and the tiping errors i know il make..im on a tight reply)...rl stoped me from explaining furderok u propose basicly that what skills u use in pvp/pve be boosted wen u pop a ship...ether npc or playernow think of the problems this involves:- traiders are screwed at this...miners are also- imagine if i make a alt and pop 50 + ships every 10 min(pop a hauler full of frigs)...is that cool if i make 2* ure sp/h- the general sp/h is around 2.5k/h ...now if a pilot gets in a titan and pops 100 bs fleet that will give him...10k(concidering 100 points/bs...thats about right concidering frig is 5 points)...that is a big boost i mite add...also this will only make the powerfull more powerfull and the active ""maniacs"" count for more"
12/11/2008,"how should i put it in words that are not reinterpretable... no pilot should ever earn more sp/hour just because he's playing actively on that particular account//character. not even one (1) extra sp per hour.if you really want more sp, wait *or* buy a larger character (presonally, i somewhat dislike the fact selling characters is allowed, but meh, that's how it already is - if anything, i'd vote to ban character sales too, even if it would hurt me too)."
12/11/2008,yeah i bet you'd quit eve if that happened.
12/11/2008,i personally would benefit if this would be implemented but i don't think it would be fair to others.we already have to grind the game to earn isk to do anything. doing it for sp as well would just create a much more imbalanced system for those who don't have the time to be on everyday.
12/11/2008,qft.
12/11/2008,"you realize that allowing skill points to be gained via players actions will open up a can of worms that might not be good for the game and cause further imbalances.we already have the ongoing problem of isk sellers/macros, that problem could easilly widen with isk sellers offering powerleveling which is something commonly offered in other ""grind for your xp"" mmos. so introducing such a system could be akin to boosting isk farmers and the rmt industry. there is too much potential for the system to be badly abused and exploited.i suggest you think about it from all angles as a whole and not just what benefits one group...."
12/11/2008,"i am going to risk wading into this topic as a noob (sp wise). i've spent 4 months playing this game so far... i have been reading these forums a massive amount for strategies and tips, studied the skills, played with numerous fittings, made billions running missions (cause that's all i really have the skills to do) and you know what? that's all i can do for the next few months. no matter how much i know, i am still working on turret support skills, capacitor skills, t2 tanking skills (cause everyone has them), navigation, agility, fitting skills (adv weapon upgrades etc). i've still got two months to go to get the relevant skills to level 4, and no way i'll be able to use t2 weapons (which is many times cheaper, and more effective, than the best named) i've worked on learning skills, got all the basic ship classes to 4, etc etc. unless i just want to fly around as a bug holding people down for others to shoot at them, i can't do anything but continue to run missions and gather my isk for a few more months until i can be useful. and even then, i'll just be marginally useful, and can't properly fulfill standard fleet roles such as a sniper (t2 guns + spike) etc etc. and lets not even go near the t2 ships.now don't get me wrong. i love this game, spending hours working on a fitting that's just right for a particular situation, that this is a thinking game more than a twitch game. however, on the flip side it's very frustrating knowing that no matter how well i fit, or how much time i put into the game, i'm going to be at a disadvantage for probably the next year compared to many players. and i can't do **** about it except sit here and twiddle my thumbs. while logging in at odd hours to change my skills.is there a solution to this dilemma? i guess i could buy a character, but then i lose out on the rp aspect (more than i already am playing achura even though i fly gallente, since i am playing catch-up in skills), and who knows what reputation the character i am buying has (did it steal from corp hangars? scam in jita?).i think that this game would be best if there were no skills at all. no, i don't like grinding skills wow style either. that's why traditionally i have enjoyed rts's or games like civ the most, it's based purely on your skill and thought, and not twitch style or ""i've been here the longest/beaten up the most npc's for points"".is this going to happen? of course not. i guess a much higher starting sp would be nice, and has the possibility of happenning. (yes, i know many old timers started with 5k sp. but guess what? everyone else did too at the time, you could go into low-sec with a few million sp and actually stand a chance).anyways, the current system really sucks for new players. sure, it works ok for those people who like flying tiny ships (which ccp seems intent on trying to make relevant, re tracking nerfs, web nerfs, missile nerfs). but for the rest of us, we just gotta sit here, carebear it up for 6 months, and then still relatively suck for the next 6 months until we can actually use t2 gear in a specific niche.just my two cents. and before i get flamed, i would far prefer a higher starting sp (guess what, some people want to fly something other than frigates!) than grinding for sp. i enjoy that my g/f and i have similar skills even though i play a lot more than her."
12/11/2008,considering it will never happen...
12/11/2008,thank you for admitting that you never really were concerned with this.
12/11/2008,bad idea - go play another game - with the excpetion of a missing skill queue and new players getting way more sps than characters from years ago - the current training system is fine
12/11/2008,"my suggestion: everyone gets a set amount of isk for every second their account is active. remove all other ways to earn isk.i know many of you will support this because in the thread about earning sp by using the skill, ( earning sp ) many great reasons were shown as to why that isn't a good idea. benefits will be similar to those mentioned in the other thread concerning sp:less grinding for iskless exploits (pos reactions anyone?)less cartels (t2 anyone)less isk selling so please support fixing the isk system, make it like the sp system."
12/11/2008,/me runs away at breakneck speed.
12/11/2008,****in ******.
12/11/2008,sarcastic troll is sarcastic ?
12/11/2008,"this isn't entirely a bad idea. it already exists in several forms in the game. though i'd like to see something maybe other than isk being a constant payout.a steady stream of lp for the faction warfare guys based on standing and rank would be a good example of something that would add to the game.straight isk would cause a inflation on all player made stuff and deflation for all npc sold items. great if you are wanting bpos, not so great if you are wanting to buy t2 ships.if they would add an isk income to the game it would have to be targeted towards brand new players that have a difficult time getting started. one of my friends keeps getting in over his head in lvl 2 missions and losing his ships, that he doesn't have the skill or money to properly fit. i give him occassional injects of isk that are tiny sums to me, giant to him, but have kept him from quiting the game out of frustation.maybe instead of isk, they could just give new players access to all the basic skills at lvl 0 (started with 1 sp each, but not completed) so they don't have to buy them. another option would be adding in a new basic fitted frigate/destroyer/cruiser sized newbe ship that insurance could give them. it would need to be big enough to handle lvl 1's easily to be effective. it would have a similar effect as an isk income without creating a continuous passive increase to the money supply (the person is going to have to go out and run missions) and causing inflation."
12/11/2008,omg this idea realy hurts...
12/11/2008,you have to be ****ing joking.
12/11/2008,"so you want to inject more isk into an economy that could be argued has too much isk in the system? a little grinding is good as people will value their isk a little more, and losing ship/assets will actually mean something. otherwise eve becomes counterstrike in space.throwing isk at this problem won't solve it.cartels are hard to maintain and enforce, due to cartels members ""cheating"" by producing/selling more than what a cartel allows. a college microeconomics course will tell you everything you need to know on that subject... in short:no"
12/11/2008,"nobody should get anything. the effects of the exploit are ir-revertable.every cpp ""injection"" into the market will just backfire and make things even worse."
12/11/2008,"bingo!however, now that a few have given great arguments as to why this is a stupid idea, please go post in the earning sp thread linked in the original post with those ideas. every argument for being able to grind isk is an argument as why we should be able to grind sp"
12/11/2008,"no it isn't actually. isk and sp work in completely different ways. sp just alter what you can use and how well you use it, while isk determines everything in game. alliances rise and fall based on isk, while real life skill is far more important than sp. the beauty of eve is that it has both aspects: you gain sp over time, but you gain isk through player skill and grind. eve is successful at the moment, so stop trying to change it to be more like wow (yes i said it).as for an analogy:this is like suggesting that either asteroids should fight back like rats, or rats should sit defenceless like asteroids."
12/11/2008,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahehehehehehehehhohohohohohoohohhahahahahaaaahahaaaa*gasp choke gasp cough**dies horribly**wakes up in clone vat*damnit.. you had to go and make me die of laughter.no!
12/11/2008,"the reason why this wouldn't work at all is that the money you receive will go directly into inflation. what really matters is the value of money, not how much you have. and value of money is determined by goods and services people are willing to provide for it. if everybody was rich, then the stuff you want to buy would be extremely expensive, because not everyone can get what they want. real effort needs to be put into obtaining stuff"
12/11/2008,it's a bad idea - and before someone suggests it so would be taxing players isk depending on how long they are logged in ...
12/11/2008,"where you are engaging in pve shouldn't be an issue.allowing someone to steal from someone without allowing them to retaliate is moronic at the very least, and is the issue."
12/11/2008,"i've always been a fan of the idea of ccp making concord less like real police. and by that i mean less prone to only make trouble for law abiding citizens while the criminals, still carrying your wallet (so you get docked for not having an id on you as well) laughs and tells the cop that you were harassing him.wtf? i'm fine with them stealing, but i should be able to take matters into my own hands.ccp has this really odd habit of making theft an acceptable and protected behavior. i have no problems with it, but it shouldn't require so much red tape to get into a squabble with the guy."
12/11/2008,"i guess the problem is that concord places ""no value"" on salvage but the market at large clearly places a rather large value on it - here lies the crux of the problem imo. though i enjoy ninja salvaging, i often wonder what would happen if you did become flagged and what difference it would make - how often would you lv 4 runners risk your ship to possible ganking by shooting at the ninja? would it really reduce it happening? i've followed runners from the starting gate to the final room (staying 1 room behind them) clearing up as i go without them setting eyes on me (whether they used the dir scanner and were aware of my ship i don't know) - so even if i did get flagged, would they get the chance to shoot me? i find the ""lost"" earnings argument a bit weak- surely the time it takes to come back and salvage could be spent earning bounties on another mission? anyway, just a few honest questions from me as i've seen many complaints but not many constructive attempts to fix it (if it even needs fixing)."
12/11/2008,"when you're in a mission with 5-6 friends you're less worried about being ganked, but at least the threat would be there.as of now you can steal legally, solo, with no repercussions at all. the more i stick around in this game i realize ccp supports griefing, stealing, and general asshattery."
12/11/2008,you move into motsu you are unable to look salvage your wrecks while mission whoringyou go to the forums and whine about ityou are stupid
12/11/2008,"that is very positive.makes me think if there even was a word ""griefing"" back the days uo came out... man those were the days. though, they could make the canflipping procedure to wrecks too, to further liven up the game by more explosions and crying people who got 'grieferered' :-dit aint easy out there for a pod pilot."
12/11/2008,"/signedyou attempted to ""pirate"" some poor neutrals who were killing a war target in your plex. you take the sec hit same as everyone else."
12/11/2008,i don't think there should be security status hits for shooting neutrals while at a fw plex site.
12/11/2008,its upsetting how stupid this thread is. and the fact we have csm representatives supporting such a cause to change criminal aggression mechanics confirms my opinion that csm is a joke and should be removed.

12/11/2008,"the primary purpose of factional warfare is to get carebears out into low sec space and get them plugged into pvp. many of us ""carebears"" place a high value on our standings. unlike the low-life pirates who find it a perk to get their standings lowered as much as possible, our values are completely opposite. we're the good citizens of the empire. we're the neighbors everyone else wants to have. if ccp doesn't fix this bug, and forces decent players to lose standings in order to defend their team mates, the whole concept of fw can become endangered when those carebears chose to opt out of fw to save their standings."
12/11/2008,"this is important. it's you who we're trying to get the attention of.gads! i hate the term ""carebear"", but hey not everyone in eve is bloodthirsty, and there is an aspect of being a cb that i have taken pride in! i'm a good citizen and i support my empire. i mine and produce in order to provide goods for others. one of the major values in eve is my standing (security, corporate, agent, faction, and now fw).after spending years as a mission runner/ miner, fw has perked my interests and now i am getting involved. yet, my values have not changed. standings are still very important to me, and to many of us.i'll fight the wts. and i'll fight the pirates, when they attack me or one of my fleet members. but i shouldn't be penalized for doing what is right."
12/11/2008,"if that mindset were followed completely, there would be no need for csm or this assembly hall.yes, i am ""dealing with it"". it's a matter that needs to be corrected."
12/11/2008,"no, it doesn't need to be corrected. if you care about your precious sec status so much, only engage people who are flashing. otherwise, you take the sec hit like the rest of us, or you sit there with your thumb up your ass while someone kills your gangmates."
12/11/2008,"they were neutrals attacking a war target, not pirates. regardless of their location they had the right (paid for by them or their target) to engage where as you do not.learn the mechanics."
12/11/2008,"i'm not sure i agree with the slaver scum about this particular issue (if there was an active war, then the neutral's attack was 'legit' and your's wasn't; if there wasn't an active war, then they would be flashy and shootable, so no problem).that having been said, i'd fully support a change to the fw plex mechanics, so that (for example) any pilots allied to the owning faction of the plex have kill rights on any pilot not allied to the owning faction. so the amarrian militia in an amarrian complex would be allowed to shoot any 'trespassers' in the plex 'in defense of the plex', in much the same way that the faction navy in the plex can do so."
12/11/2008,"i do believe, in that case, a warning should be issued (much like carrying contraband)."
12/11/2008,"how about just making plexes free for all zones and leave it at that? i mean they are military installations after all. removing them from concord juristiction seems to be what the originating post is asking for. that would allow what he asked for, in a fashion that didn't mean it could automatically be abused by pirates too, would it not?"
12/11/2008,"actually, i'm the 'pirate' the op is referring to. at least i think so - he certainly opened fire upon, and destroyed my ship whilst i was pursuing someone i was at war with. i resent being called a 'low life pirate'. my sec status is 3.3 and my faction standings can only be described as 'excessive'. i don't consider losing them a 'perk', and i don't actually like losing them any more than the op does. but the point stands - he fired on me, not the other way around. he therefore loses the sec status, and i lose my ship. why should the op be free to open fire on me unprovoked and destroy my ship? or are you suggesting i shouldn't fight back against someone i'm at war with, and should just dock up and hide? i think the militia here are just voting for a 'win' button because they're too lazy to do the time for their crime. isn't that what ""real"" pirates are told to do when they pop someone?"

12/11/2008,supporting my own thread :)
12/11/2008,"yeah so on occasion i like to mine, and on occasion i make capital ships.the resource requirements for tritanium and pyerite for these things is digusting. if it weren't for chinese farmers, it'd be impossible to fulfill these requirements.mining these even with a fleet of exhumers can take days for a single ship worth of ore do to the lackluster distribution.importation is a horrendous pain in the ass for lack of a better term. a freighter can't hold barely but a few parts of a capital ship worth of components. moving the resources out of the hubs towards manufacturing areas while better still is fraught with risk thanks the pirate population (and more power to you too).when you're a sovreignty holding alliance there are a lot of '****' systems as far as miners are concerned. they don't have the security status to have anything better than empire (-0.5 truesec or better) but they hvae lots of low ends that take ridiculous amounts of time to retrieve. so why not give us a class of ship that flat out processes the asteroid. i'm talking planet killer from star trek style mining. you roll up (incredibly slowly) to one of these things, and you 'seige' and eat the rock.your seige cycle is typical to any capital ship seige, 6m, uses some type of fuel, etc.your mining module is activated, and you eat so much volume of rock per cycle. the deliverable is a compressed cube of the ore you've eaten. so in today's word about 2 or 3 veld cubes per veld rock.you can only eat the low end ores though, so only veld, scordite, pyroxes, plagioclase, omber, hedbergite and hemorphite. the refining v ores.to do this, you'd need:mining barge v, exhumer v, capital industrial ship v, and then excavator i - v.refining v, refining efficiency v, veld through hemorphite processing to v then a new skill and i've not come up with a fun name, but asteroid processing? something like that to operate your asteroid consumption module.cargo hold doesn't need to be huge, because you're compressing the minerals. maybe you only can load a bpo as a script to the module so you'd need to carry the compression bpos around for those modules. you couldn't jet can, you'd need to put in a cha or something, and like any super capitla class ship whomever flys the thing lives in it. 0.4 space or lower, etc.thoughts?"
12/11/2008,"this would go a long way in dumping a lot more dysprosium and promethium. for a lot less time, money and pain that was spent on alchemy.this might have been already mentioned in this room but because ccp can't create a search for searching individual rooms i'm not going too. you can add that to a list of things that need to be done immediately. its ridiculous that chribba can do it from an external site but ccp can't do it internally. might explain why they never noticed offline pos's making ferm and ferrogel for 4 years."
12/11/2008,"t2 moon miners, if they work as previously described, would only help for deposits that have an abundance greater than 1. while this would help somewhat, i would venture to say most dyspro/prom deposits have abundance [1] and t2 miners wouldn't buff the output any."

12/11/2008,"as we all now know the first alliance involved in the latest incident of bug exploiting, i think we should demand that every asset ownd by evoke/g and their alt corps, should be terminated.i speak of course about the countless super/capitals, t2 blueprints and ships they build in the last 3 years with the money cheat enabled.therefore their corps and alliances should be disband and put into a hall of shame, visibly for everyone once ambulation is out."
12/11/2008,how about you post this idea with your main?
12/11/2008,"until ccp disclose who did it you shouldn't accuse people, unless you have the proof. on the other hand i agree that whoever benefited from the exploit should have the isk/assets taken back. this of course is a long process of tracking the isk and transactions, especially if you consider it went on for four years. however on the flip side of the coin you should not punish members that simply played the game without knowing this exploit was happening in their very alliance or corporation. in 2008 we don't burn down villages to kill the witch anymore, you get snipers and take her out. where the hell i got that analogy from i don't know, but you should get the point."

12/11/2008,"at the moment implants are one of those things, that cannot be produced by players - though they can be kind of grinded in missions, which is the wrong way, i think.so what about producing those implants - just normal t1 (and possibly t2, but no faction-/pirate-implants)? there are still unused resources ingame, e.g. those drugs you can find in missions, blue pills etc. actually, they do not have any use till now, except you can sell them. why don't use those as materials for the production of implants? those can only be acquired by doing missions, so missionrunners would get a new money source. to balance that, i would propose to remove implants as a reward from (storyline-)missions ... it would make getting money with missions harder, as you should need more (new) skills to produce implants.in the same breath the prices of those 'materials' would rise through the roof, so it should be well-balanced how much mats are needed to produce a specific implant. perhaps, to save the prices of low-end-implants (+1/+2/...), those should not be removed from the list of rewards for missions, so every +3-t1/t2-implant or better has to be produced, as it does not longer drop as a reward.one interesting thing are the politics of the empires concerning those drugs ... to produce implants at another station then the missionhub you have to get past the navys the gates - adding some spice to the carebear's life in empire. ^^"

12/11/2008,why was pos bowling declared an exploit if bumping ships is a valid tactic?
12/11/2008,"do a basic ship class check on bumping so that only ships of equal/larger class move you, while a smaller ship gets moved. ie everything moves a shuttle, but only another freighter can bump a freighter. for ships of same class than they'd both move. in this case class only means what it's under on the market with t2 being their base hull class."
12/11/2008,interceptor has more kinetic energy than your transport ship. pewpew
12/11/2008,"please throw a slate of ice, let say 3inch, at a brick wall. come back with the result as to which break up.kinetic is not all. even if you go really really fast, then the collision system won't have time to recognise the impact incoming and prepare for it, said impact will occur (because if it take 12 seconds to align, you can believe it can take 12 second to desalign and ""avoid"" the collision, right?), the ship will take damage but so will you. bumping still occur, depending on where you hit it (dead center of gravity, sideway, on the nose or tail, spin)."
12/11/2008,inertia. your interceptor hasn't the mass to impart enough of its kinetic energy to the transport ship...you're a bug on a windshield.
12/11/2008,"exactly. even if i get thrown off course by the impact, it should still do something to both of us. i hadn't initially thought of the idea of impact damage, but i think if it was enough to be appreciable it could be an effective solution. the only problem would be if they set it so the damage can be completely negated by small ships putting us exactly where we are now."

12/11/2008,"and what effect does that have?think about it this way.if wealth hordes exist and attacking them is not deflationary then what is the point of wealth hordes or the point of attacking them? what do you care if someone has a lot of money and never uses it. as you say, it has no effect on the economy.deflaton and inflation are not neutral activities in eve or the real world. in the real world its because prices are sticky. in eve its because isk and item production is sticky.if you cut the amount of isk in the world in two, and prices for everything halved, then the value of isk production activities would double. i.e ratting and missioning would be even more effective and mining even lessbut there is more. eve is a system where fairly tight npc import based system to regulate the money supply. since players can buy npc items and convert these items into minerals. cutting into everyone's money has a real effect on the actual wealth of the system.this is just plain false. not only are there plenty of isk sinks(at the very least there will be at least one mineral price cap enforcing price levels if the other isk sinks are not behaving properly)luxury goods have value relative to other goods. any money that is truly idle could not be used to purchase luxury goods."
12/11/2008,"so the only safe way to remove isk from the system is insurance and pos fuel? and to have those costs generally locked in place huh? cause thats about whats happening right now.hersch, i get it, there are secondary, tertiary, etc effects on the market. yes a lower money supply can lead to deflation, you don't need to hit me with anymore walls of text repeating that, i know.despite eve's economic model being very simplified vs a real economic model, its not so simplified that by eliminating one player's wallet will guarantee a price drop on megathrons in jita.i do believe my the idea could result in deflation if executed horribly. i recognize this, im not that thick. if you put unlimited super-tempests on sale at a locked in, competative price, then lots of people partake, and money is deleted more uniformly from more players. thats bad.now if the supply is artificially kept low and price goes up such that they aren't options for 99% of players, they should only have a large impact on the luxury markets. i just don't imagine that a player or corporation would opt to buy a super-battleship rather than a titan they might need to support their logistical needs or something. they might choose to instead of getting a full snake set for their interceptor alt, or officer shield boosters for their raven. big effect on that market, a much smaller and distributed effect everywhere else.but meh, my belief that it would not cause deflation is just a belief as is yours that it would cause deflation. i don't agree with you, and you seem to be upset by the idea of change on an economy.you use verbage like consequences, attack on wealth, nasty secondary effects. i feel as if i've offended you by introducing an idea to un-uniformly remove isk from the system.i'm almost interested to know how you feel about insurance's effect on tech 1 markets or pos fuel's effect on tech 2 markets. are you offended by those? those most certainly threaten to deflate more than a luxury exit that aims to effect only the wealthy. (and for the love of god i know there are secondary effects i don't need another lecture)"
12/11/2008,"i'm not opposed to changing the economic model, i am opposed to doing it to achieve ill-defined goals without a workable plan. at present, you don't seem to know what you want to do - you throw out lines about wealth hoarding and richie rich, but i'm not sure your proposal has any more intellectual depth than using shiny toys to stick it to the man. a lot of people have a psychological barrier between ""normal people"" and ""the rich"" that utterly buggers up their economic analysis, because there is no clear line, and you can't make the rich poorer without making society poorer, as a rule. here's what you said was your intention in your first post on the topic: now in this post, you seem to be citing deflation as one of your primary goals - you're clearly not referring to the proper finance(or physics) meaning of ""leverage"", so i have to assume that you're advocating removing money from rich people's wallets by giving them fancy ships to buy to cause deflation. the rich are better off because they have pimped ships, the poor are better off because their money goes further, i.e., prices are lower, i.e., there has been deflation. why you're shying away from that i don't know, because it's about the only way to defend your proposal. if you want this to happen, the correct line of argument is ""...and make insurance based on market prices"", not to deny the obvious impact of your suggestion when that was most of the point of it from the beginning. trying to organize your defence based around the principle that there's an economy for rich people, an economy for normal people, and never the twain shall meet, just shows that you don't know what you're talking about. pulling the old ""you have your opinion and i have mine"" shtick is equally worthless - unless you have a degree in economics and spend an hour a day discussing, debating, researching, and seeking to understand economic systems, your opinion on this topic is simply less informed than mine. you could, theoretically, be right, but defend your argument, don't use relativism as a shield. you can't settle an argument with ""well, neither of us really knows"" when one of us does know. i'm not offended by anything you've proposed, i just think that your suggestions wouldn't work, and that your arguments defending them are utter trash. as for my opinions, i'd like to see as many of these artificial barriers removed as is practical, so that suggestions of this nature can at least be sanely considered. insurance should be market-based, no item should be both npc purchasable and refineable, and any other artificial barriers that may exist ought to be removed if practical as well. i still wouldn't be a fan of your idea, but it wouldn't be obviously wrong. once the prerequisites have been satisfied, then we can look at more widespread changes to the game's economy as regards monetary policy - allow players to mine pos fuel, or replace t1 loot drops with cash/lp, or introduce new cash-based goods and services from npcs on a large scale, or anything else in that vein. some of those proposals are good, many more are bad, but there's a lot of interesting ways you can take it once you push us closer to a proper free market for money. until you do that, however, you simply can't tinker with monetary policy much without it blowing up in your face. lay the groundwork, and *then* propose big new money taps and sinks."
12/11/2008,"i watched the economic video from the eve get-together and saw a chart on how much isk enters the system vs how much exits. and it enters at an alarming rate, and exits not so fast.i'd just like to see what kind of effect a luxury isk exit would have on the growth of total money supply in eve.i doubt it would cause deflation in the sense of prices going down but i think it would eventually cause value of isk to increase.you know what i mean? losing a battleship used to be terrible, like losing a dreadnaught. now nearly everyone can afford to fly tech 2 in pvp. i believe the general escalation of status quo has been caused by there being so much isk entering the system and not enough exits that players actually want to participate in. (who wants to be podded or collect insurance if if means being blow up)the first part of luxury exits would only really impact the wealthy, but as the wealth is leveraged, it would effect a broader audience as players would be willing to spend less and less on luxury npc goods, the npc's prices would decay.i believe a luxury exit would slow down the rapidly increasing isk supply thus slowing down the escalation of what is considered the barrier of entry into a pvp fight.so yeah, stick it to the man (lol?) at first, then eventually it might increase the value of lower tech and/or smaller ship classes.hell it might stop the escalation in its tracks or even reverse it.but i only think it'd be really great if you offered it in tandem with a luxury mineral exit as well. i don't think minerals are too abundant but i also don't really see the opportunity for them to become too valuable either without there simply being fewer miners.imagine if everyone in eve mined and nobody pvp'd. thankfully that doesn't happen, but i think there is a real possibility for there to become too high a mineral supply in eve. just an idea~"
12/11/2008,"bad analogy tchell because, actually, you wouldn't get a ticket, you'd get arrested.garbage put out is for a specific service to pick up. it's on private property and remains private property until picked up. some garbage pickers have actually been charged with trespassing and theft over this matter (usually as a real world way to 'grief' the garbage pickers).the analogy you want is tossing something over the side of your vessel in international waters on the high seas. then it belongs to anyone, just as a ship completely abandoned by its crew becomes the property of whoever boards it.at least that's how maritime law used to work. probably still does as it doesn't change quickly."

12/12/2008,"the whole concept of wreck ownerships should be trashed. its rediculous. it really is and is a sad indictment on eve online. if you must have wreck ownership only the original owner should have any rights to the wreck and then only in high sec. alliances no matter how bloated with themselves should be reminded that they are just roaming gangs of pirates. the original topic poster is trying to sound badass with the corp name and alliance name and is crying about wreck rights... and stamping foot and demanding that game mechanics allow him to get revenge on a whole corp for a single players sweet ninja abilities. i'd have thought the ""hard core"" pvp scene the most accepting of a lack of rules regarding this issue. comon evolve become really badass and figure a way to stop the slavager"
12/12/2008,i don not support the concept of wreck ownership as the above post appears to indicate. i support the discussion and then removal of wreck ownership.

12/12/2008,"nah, the point is that you do have to do a certain degree of research obviously. it would be lame if there was an ooc tag ""event happening"" - but when there is a news report that in the next 48hour the galfed are going to be moving new combat assets into the black rise theatre and warn all non-involved capsule pilots to say clear of x,y,z constellations or be shot on sight - you'd like to see some actual combat assets out there doing what they said they'd do on the tin.there is scope for great variety in the kind of events that can be run and some of them can be very small and personal. others might actually require players and corporations and alliances to follow up for anything to happen. but the current situation is simply ""no events, no in game stuff, no actors, no happenstance and no excitement"". and this thread is about changing that - so i'd like to ask the poster above to re-consider his support in the light of that status quo."

12/12/2008,"really nice story and the fact that i and others really enjoyed it means it does have value, value that unfortunately ccp`s marketing department sees as wasted funds.the potential to turn eve from an everyday grinding into a living breathing entity is priceless and should be encouraged. i used to host an ultima online shard, with a similar relaxed skilling method as eve and a similar philosophy when it came letting players change the storyline. however sometimes we gm`s had to give the storyline a little nudge and see what players did with it then react to whatever they did. your story is a perfect example of a good gm team doing what seemed to be a very fun time. the jamyl coronation could have been a seriously interesting event to see. i would have loved to see the glorious amarr fleet and the inspiring speech. i would have loved to be able to say four years down the line ""i was there"". even though i am not currently an avid eve roleplayer, as oveur once said we are all roleplaying to a certain extent whether we want to or not. even though i would probably have been a simply bystander it would have been fantastic to see tons of players gathering to see it live. to see cva et al come up to admire their new empress, to see anti-amarr try and disrupt it and fail or succeed, to see anything else that this goddamn asteroid i'm busy mining.you nailed it on the head when you said that it's because ccp are afraid of the consequences of making events. we wonder why eve has lost it's flair it had 4-5 years ago, and this is one of the reasons: ccp being scared of the whinage and threadnaughts. well guess what ccp, this threadnaught is coming straight for you!"

12/12/2008,"sorry to go back a bit in the thread, but i'm catching up and wanted to respond specifically to something from you said earlier that i think is very important for ccp/csm and indeed the player community here. well, i think this might be one of those defining moments in eve history where the rules need to be changed. this is potentially well beyond the simple kind of exploit where one player cheats and is punished and everyone carries on regardless. if what has happened here is anywhere near the scope we fear, then it has had a major impact on the game of eve online and its important that the air is cleared and we can see who is guilty and (more importantly) who is innocent in the realm of 0.0 politics and alliance game.i'm not personally a fan of ""name and shame"" for ordinary transgressions and bans from personal exploits and minor villainy - but cheating on this scale demands more transparency and far more extensive disclosure of what has happened, how, and in which ways it impacted the political balance of 0.0. we also need a far more detailed response from ccp on how long the exploit has been running and how it was missed. is it really the case that the first time this was noticed was in the recent petition or was it reported earlier (as allegeded on 3rd party forums)? if it was known about a long time ago what went wrong? important to note that its not for players to manage their expectations - players obviously want to know whats going on here. if the exploit is on the scale it appears then there is a need to restore faith and trust again and assure us that all those responsible have been appropriately punished. we also need to know what happened to the proceeds of cheating - where did the isk go? which bpos got bought? which titans were made? which alliances were advantaged as a result?basically lavista - i didn't vote for you last time because i lacked much faith in you being able to deliver results in a crisis. time to prove me wrong. and for the people i did vote for, ank, omber, pattern, - please get in there and don't take no for an answer. its vital we get great transparency on this issue. this isn't an ordinary exploit, its not a case of ordinary bannings and naughty individuals being protected from the results of their shame. there is a need for the eve player base to know the full truth now otherwise all 0.0 pos owning entities are going to get viewed with suspicion henceforth and that isn't good for the game. csm was created in part as a result to the poor first response to the t20 scandal. time to learn those lessons and give the degree of disclosure required to truly restore public confidence. and frankly - if you get stonewalled on this stuff you should be considering your positions not running spin.names i agree on. but i do want to know which corporations, which alliances, how much isk and where it went. and i do want to know how many titans got produced with this illicit income. this situation created the drama. the cheats created the drama. ccp/csm can control and reduce the drama but giving appropriate focus and transparency to this issue. sweeping it under the carpet will not make it go away so again i urge you to be tough this weekend and get the answers we need."

12/12/2008,"yeah, you know, showing the context would be pretty sweet too... i can bet it's in a context where it's explained how much isk matters in this game, alongside some clarifications that ""expert"" players don't actually need to be all that active to make isk if they rely on ""market pvp"" of sorts.most games have a ""grind for xp, gring for gear, grind for special spells/whatever"" system, all of which are at least partially mandatory. eve has a system where there's only one thing to grind, namely isk, and you don't even have to grind that either since you have enough ways to get it by using more brain, less activity (but a bit of risk and depend on how other players are doing).eve *had* a ""get sp for doing stuff"" system (but granted, an unlimited one, and one without much oversight... and still not all that fast), and it was basically horrible - people would just leave their characters on to do something semi-automated. the guys from ccp quickly realized that they don't really like the idea of multiple levels of grinding, so they sought to reduce the gind to a minimum, while still maintaining some noteworthy distinction between active/inactive people, and rewarding guile on both counts, wether active or inactive.so, bottom line, the effort required to implement a system where people wouldn't just end up half-exploiting it thanks to alts or friends is just too big, while the end-result is not only insignificant for gameplay, but also regarded as a bad thing by quite some people.considering ccp has a lot of things that are way easier to do and a lot of people consider beneficial, this idea makes no practical sense."
12/12/2008,"dumb, not supported, etc."
12/12/2008,"and thats where the details would come into play, finding the sweet spot.theres the everquest way of being required to play, and the eve way of not needing to play at all.there are benefits to both and downsides to both.actually logging in to play everquest feels more rewarding than logging in to play eve.not logging in to play eve if you don't feel like it feels much better than not logging in to play everquest.on the flip side everquest is a grind, and logging in to play eve is not rewarding at all sometimes.the important thing would be to reward the vastly diverse playstyles that any particular player enjoys doing for fun. thats the difference between grind and fun."
12/12/2008,i've been playing for a month or so & im already bored with this games skill system. waiting 3 weeks for a skill to fly a ship that i already own... well thats boring & im paying a monthly subscription on top of that!!! talk about a ****ty deal here. it's a game for crying out loud.we have a on going term in our corp - it's not the # of weeks but the % of subscribtion time. i.e. 3weeks = 3/4 of a subscribtion or if you do the math it's $11.25 to learn that skill ...please impliment something to shorten the level v skills or forget it ill find something more fun to play
12/12/2008,no.i have no interest in turning eve in another grind for a level game.all this does is create power leveling and people who pay someone else to level there character 24 hours a day.it hurts casual players and rewards players that have nothing better to do but play the game.besides people are already rewarded for playing the game in the form of isk.more isk means more options.real time training and a single server is what makes eve what it is.remove either and you will destroy the game.
12/12/2008,"the effort to implement could be massive undertaking. the initial idea definitely. or ccp could already have a system designed, who knows. i can't help but assume ccp think about this kind of thing a lot more than i do.but then again everything you do in eve is some sort of transaction on the server side. buy something, sell something, move something, blow something up, do a mission, mine ore, refine ore, research something, build something, scan something, hack something, etc something~they're all already in the game as some sort of transaction, and those are just the ones that give feedback to the client.i think it could be pretty easy to implement depending on how complicated you wanted to get with it.the first way i proposed (the initial idea represented by the picture), i agree with you it would take a good bit of effort to get right, especially with making it easily understandable by the player. the third way however i think would actually be pretty easy.plus just imagine what the investment into that complicated architecture could do for achievement tracking. theres all sorts of player personalization potential in eve, and tbh i'd like it if they tracked my actions whether they reward it with sp or not. oh so i've made that much money total selling stuff, spent that much money buying stuff, hauled more veld than chribba, delt more damage than shrike, discovered more phenomena than captain kirk.as far as exploits, exploits happen and you really just have to accept that things will be exploited by some players.but that really isn't important if it provides enjoyment for the majority of players.remember quake 3? it has terrible lag. they made a patch one time that made it playable, but apparently susceptible to hacking, so they turned it off and the lag was terrible again.you get the idea, you never want to deprive your majority just because something has some flaws that a couple asshats will take advantage of.you just limit the amount of damage those asshats can cause. imo~and about no added value. i believe it would be a large added value to most players. for some its a playstyle goal that is totally missing from eve, for others its just extra gratification for playing eve.for those that don't give a crap, i completely understand, and wouldn't have them change their ways at all."
12/12/2008,"i agree with the op that there needs to be a sort of sp gain / action system. i don't know how it would be implemented, and i cannot be bothered to give examples of one. however, i do not enjoy sitting around for months at a time waiting for base skills so that i can be semi-proficient in more than just buzzing around in a frigate scrambling people.did i play wow? yes. one of eight mmo's i've played, in thas particular mmo i had 8 max level characters. i'm a power leveler and i admit that i would power level the **** out of myself given the oppurtunity in eve online. i don't understand why you people feel like you're being ""punished"" just because given the oppurtunity i would move more quickly in the game instead of being stuck at your turtle pace.i challange you all to give me one valid reason, for why this shouldn't be implemented in some way or form? you say that it would encourage power leveling; so what? how many people ghosted characters for years just to sell them in the future?it would create an unfair advantage to people who played? what's wrong with that? you're saying its wrong for people who play to be rewarded for actually playing? why is the guy with 2 jobs who logs in 1 time a week entitled to be just as good as the guy who bleeds his heart and soul in to the game every day? because the other guy was ""lucky"" enough to find the game first? how is that anymore fair?ccp if you have any intention of expanding this game and your playerbase you need to learn to make your game more accesible. i don't care about quality vs quantity, i just want to see over a million people playing eve-o."
12/12/2008,no
12/12/2008,because this is not wow.stop being a mmotard and accept the fact that eve-online will remain unique for that very reason.if you don't have time to play the game... then you shouldn't be playing it in the first place.i have a full time job... i pay my bills...just like any other hard working individual.the only reason i play this game is because its not like other mmo[rpg]s where i won't get overhsaodwed by some punkass idiot who's played only a week and does things that other players spent weeks if not months of hard earned time and work getting to.everyone has an equal chance of acheiving the ability to use/employ the hundreds of fun little things you can in this game.... each advanced aspect takes time.not effort.anyone can sit on there ass for an few hours and level up a character.few have brains enough...let alone the maturity to wait.... and be patient.patience is everything in this game.... and that's why i will gladly spend more money on this game to keep it that way.don't like it?gtfo and gb2wow.personally i love the fact that i have to wait an entire month just to use something very high tech.granted... maybe the timers could be shortened just a tad.... but then again.... it would devalue the full worth of said thing.personally this entire proposal says one thing.... you lack patience... you have no maturity in such a thing... and your tired of waiting to level up your uber chacter.tough.... adapt or quit....
12/12/2008,"i love how everyone's argument falls into insults someone proclaiming yourself to be more ""mature"" just because you apparently can wait and i can't. i never said i could not wait, infact if the skill system were to stay the same i could care less. however, waiting is not fun, and no amount of bs that you spew at me can make me believe that you actually think that waiting is fun. waiting is inherently not fun, for you waiting is conveniant because you do not have free time.the problem isn't that i do not have time to play the game, the problem is i do have time to play the game. yet other then mining / running l3's for isk to buy items i can't even use ( i have a abaddon sitting in my hanger that i won't even attempt to fly until the end of january). sorry, waiting in this game isn't entertaining and it isn't fun. i'll wait of course, as i said before i've got every intention of playing this game for the next year or two. however, i will not be against a more active sp gain system on top of the system we currently have."
12/12/2008,"ok, here's one:"
12/12/2008,"once again, why is this wrong? so apparently advancing your character more quickly through your own efforts is a bad thing?"
12/12/2008,"thank you for proving my point as far as maturity goes./thumbs up""good things come to those who wait"""
12/12/2008,"i admit even i specified design against allowing power-grinding, but mostly because thats what all of eve's current players are used to...i admit that is very ""keeping up with the jones's"" of me.. sader makes good points and introduces and represents a playstyle that is very unpopular in eve.question is then, should sader be considered a valid player and a valid playstyle, or should he gb2wow*? (*which isn't funny btw, you can stop that ****wit childish nonsense anytime now)this is a unique discussion because its essentially opposed by people that, rather than being motivated by wanting something for themselves, instead are motivated by not wanting others to have something.i suppose you'd run into the same problem in wow if you proposed a passive skill training system. ""hell no, earn it! gb2eve!"" even though i'd be perfectly fine with people to passively gain experience in wow and also be able to earn it. ditto for eve.but then again i'm in support of most things as long as it doesn't take away from the experience of others.saber, ironically your playstyle is fully supported as far as gaining isk and resources is concerned, but suggest the same idea for gaining sp and eve players will look at you like you're jove or something."
12/12/2008,drake you aren't mature and the fact that you even bring it up proves it.i thought this thread was over and you weren't gonna post anymore?
12/12/2008,"and what of hard work, persistence and perserverance? these aren't traits that should be bear results? being able to wait for months, weeks, and years at a time shouldn't be the only way to ""reward"" players."
12/12/2008,wrong thread... try reading.
12/12/2008,largest time i've had to wait was no more than a month.anything more than that.... your exaggerating and too lazy to switch your skills.i do know that there's a great deal of discussion over a skill queue.i dont know of a skill that takes a year... maybe doomsday weapon operation level 5? : o )
12/12/2008,"no, implementing a system that its proponents freely admit they will abuse is a bad thing."
12/12/2008,if a system is being used as intended it isn't abuse.
12/12/2008,do you honestly believe i was talking about one single skill taking years to train?
12/12/2008,so...playing eve activly in an effort to progress a toon faster = abuse?
12/12/2008,you really are a one of a kind.... i'll give you that much.
12/12/2008,instead of giving vague ambiguous statements how about you just answer the question.
12/12/2008,why should i answer a question about something you said yourself.you said years.... i took it at face value.
12/12/2008,"hello,my proposition is that accelerator gates should allow assault frigates through, certainly when the mission itself doesn't forewarn that only specific ships are allowed to go through to the second room.assault frigates are still frigates, rather than having to go back to a station to purchase another ship just to continue beyond the first gate.thank you."
12/12/2008,i fail to see the reasoning/rationale for this.a destroyer is more than adequate enough to handle that.why overdo it?

12/12/2008,excuse me?assault frigates are tech 2 versions of frigates.a destroyer <generic> is tech 1.a rich player can afford to buy several destroyers...new players can only afford tech 1 ships.i'm failing to see your reasoning.

12/12/2008,"ooooh, a csm. i like. =)***i have another question, then.ccp reset the market histories for quite a few items because of this causing people to lose money via the market. how does ccp plan to compensate the innocent people they hurt by doing this?"
12/12/2008,"here's a question i would love to know the answer to.why should we belive that ccp isnt hiding a lot of the ramifications this exploit has had on the game?after all, who is really there to check if what ccp has said is the entire truth"
12/12/2008,why didn't there market man find this?name and shame the lot of em tbh but doubt we will get that.i don't think it would be that hard to see there was way to many items of beging made ingame there where was ways to make it.
12/12/2008,"to ccp - what assurances do players have that their game play, their time, and their hard work and effort are among others in an equal playing field?to ccp - if exploits to this extent are still out there, what changes are being done to see that these are caught and fixed promptly before they can cause great economic impact again?"
12/12/2008,what i really want to know is:did ccp really receive multiple petitions/bug reports on this over the years and not say anything until it came out on a third party forum?this of itself will speak volumes for me.i would like the truth to this question answered.if anyone has an old record of their report please step forward for all!
12/12/2008,"last night i forgot to change my skill. i wanted to train a specific one and have it ready today after work. now it won't be.this made me wonder whether it would be good if we could save up lost time. like overnight i lost about 7 hours. if we could save that and apply it to the skill we learn next then we could always get our full 30 days a month worth of learning. you're not always able to predict when you won't be ingame. i don't think this would affect the game in any way, and you could put a savings limit on it of 24 hours to make sure people still sign on at least once a day. it would create a nice buffer imho."

12/12/2008,"good thing we have clone vats drake :-) this is still a ******ed idea, i like blowing things up, mining, and buying/selling to make iskies, its one of the challenges i enjoy in eve. nothing is wrong with the current system of earning isk or sp accruel, minus the exploiters, they should all die."
12/12/2008,"free isk? that causes inflation. what we should do is institute a concord tax of 30% on everybody who makes over a million isk a day, and spread that wealth around to the poorest 15% of the eve population. just look at income. don't worry if they're giving to people who don't do anything in game, or it goes to people who havn't played in a year, we're helping the little guy! everybody deserves to have a private fleet of capital ships. it's their god given right.seriously, i love how people stand up in a video game and tell you that you have to work to earn a living, but i'm betting 90% of these same people won't say that in real life.giving people free money ruins the isk economy. it'll cause inflation and the devaluation of isk from those people who actually earn it.anyway, i agree with the majority (as of now), free isk is a terrible idea. there's supposed to be a downside to being poor."

12/12/2008,"and what would somebody like you do without all the mission runners?that's the problem with parasites. they think they're owed something. you make a career out of ****ing with other people, and counter-complain with ad hominim attack because other want to enjoy the game as much as you do and make your job harder.i honestly don't see a difference. a carebear wants to be left alone to play the game without risk. you anti-carebears want to be left alone except make sure ccp allows you to victimize people without risk. but both of you want to play your game without anybody being able to stop you. so why is your side somehow right?and i'm supposed to think that somehow, they're the *******? i just want to know what would happen with all of you pirates who think the game is all about you would do if all of the carebears really did quit eve like you keep telling them to. when there's nothing left but the nosec alliances and pirates.might be an interesting game, but when you keep getting eaten by the bigger pirate factions, i doubt you'll complain about ""the way things were"" nearly as much.i agree that eve isn't a game of total security, nor should it be. but that doesn't mean that the current system, where concord protects theft of property and doesn't allow people to call in friends and kill the thief is right."

12/12/2008,"ccp have a great game here. but for the last 2-3 years, almost every patch ends up wiping out my overview settings etc. this aspect should be reformed. i must have personally redone all my overviews around 40+ times at least. when i talk about overviews, i am also including brackets in this.i suggest......1. ability to save overviews. nuff said, you save your overview and you can import it from a file for those who are so inclined.or2. ability for directors to save a overview set that their corp/alliance can load up from a ingame menu. this means 1 set of overviews is more than enough for the corp/alliance, thus reducing the requirement that everybody makes their own overview set thus reducing duplication of resources. pro's - a corp/alliance can save a set overview list that their members can use in momentsthink about it. you join a corp and you no longer have to worry about having a half assed overview set. you simply hit a buttom and bang, you have the same set of overviews as everyone else in your corp. imagine you are a gang leader teaching newer players pvp. how cool would it be if you could say ""everyone change to ew overview"" and then your corpmates would switch the settings? how would you feel to know that you can have standardisation so everybody is singing from the same hymm sheet?discuss."
12/12/2008,i like the idea of removing concord protection from people stupid enough to enter a factional warzone (ie the plex) - though i'm not sure how implementable it is.one thing though - would this change mean that cva and u'k blobs start camping plexes? i can't decide if that's classed as a good thing(tm) or not - esp as my corp is apparently kos to cva
12/12/2008,"i want you to think long and hard about what your saying. your saying that a pirate could camp a fw plex site w/o any sec status for shooting people. remember unintended consequences. you want your anti-pirates to have free reign to shoot in fw plexs... your going to get pirates shooting w/ free reign in those same plexs.remember a pirate can get his sec status positive, just to overcome your idea of the ebil piwate.also for people who say neutrals interfering with someone who has a war dec needs to be stopped, need a clue. step 1) create alt corp, step 2) war dec corp with 1 man alt corp, step 3) profit/invulnerability"
12/12/2008,"it would be impossible to flag the target just to one side as there is no way to know what loyalties the pilot has. that means you have to make them a free kill to anyone in the plex. that would encourage piracy as there are plenty of militia members who would quite happily take a free killmail and associated loot without worrying too much about the affiliation of the pilot.personally i think a better solution would be that any pilot who has -5 standing towards a militia faction becomes a free target to all militia pilots in that faction, just the same as they are to the faction navy ships in hi-sec space. also have attacking a militia pilot lose you standing with their affiliated faction. make this applicable anywhere outside of hi-sec not just in plexes and things get much more interesting."
12/12/2008,good god you say some stupid things.
12/12/2008,"welcome to eve ... or something.seriously, that's how eve works, what exactly is the issue here? all i would support is alliances being able to war dec the militia as a whole."
12/12/2008,"i could see this as a viable response. it would allow a proper and legitimate action taken against a known hostile. i still believe that a fleet in lo-sec should be allowed to defend a team member from any form of aggression while in a complex, even if that hostile is at war with that individual. when one fleet member is under attack, the whole fleet is under attack.that aggressor should be flashy red to the whole fleet.agreed!good idea."

12/12/2008,"i made a proposal about a month ago to limit the assembly hall topics being created only by csm, or ccp pplz. then once inside the thread anyone could support/not support the idea and talk about itit was mainly shunned because people agreed the real problem is the moderation... what has been done since then.(see nothing) also some people would fret tooo much without being able to make topics in this forum, without realizing they could still make it in f&i or g&d. then once a csm member saw something the people of eve wanted... they could make hte topic in assembly hall and have the people post their ""support"" or lack thereof.at this current rate game&development and ""features & ideas"" are just repeats of this forum and it just results into multiple topics spammed on the same ideas in multiple forums.either way i support your idea."
12/12/2008,thanks for you replyi actualy came into the hall to see if there was actual issues worthy of note recently (pos sploit) i understand that people would see any form of moderation in the assembly hall as censorship but the forums have been setup to have very specific channels whereby the developers and players can focus their views in a single and group orientated place. if anything the csm panel should support increased moderation here so that the actuall issues (such as the pos sploit) can be discussed.i spoke with some dev's at ff and those that are behind game development read the development forums so if we really wanted dev attention with new ideas then thats where they should be posted. certainly not here :/
12/12/2008,"yes please, assembly hall as degenerated into a combination of c&p, caod, features and ideas, and general discussion.."
12/12/2008,"umm... how else is the community supposed to bring up things we wans csm to talk about? wasn't the csm essentially supposed to have some ""right to petition"" kind of purpose? and now you're suggesting we make it so that csm, this council of 12 people, has no way of hearing what people are actually upset about?and what else are we likely to want csm to talk to ccp about? it seems to me that the natural result of this channel is to be exactly what it is now. a place for people to debate changes they think need to exist now, and a way to let the people who are supposed to be our advocates know what we want them to advocate.""political forum between ccp and the players."" what is politics all about? getting things changed or kept the same.so how is this supposed to be a political forum if we can't talk about what we want out of the game?"
12/12/2008,"there is a difference between an issue and an idea. if you want a change or have an idea about a specific module then the correct forum should be features and ideas or game development. game issues such as customer service, pettition queues and exploits are what the assembly hall should be about. if you believe that the current spam of ideas belong in this forum then maybe the csm are incorrectly focussed. if you believe that the csm should be more inclined towards game ideas then wtf is the ideas forum used for ?in the op i quoted what wrangler had posted for the assembly hall description. i dont know where the line between a new idea for gameplay and ingame issues lie but i firmly believed that the csm were there for game issues and not game development. more direct question(s) to you. why dont you post your idea into the ideas forum and feel the need to post into the csm arena ? why also do you suspect that others do the same ?i suspect that either people feel that the csm are here for game development and are a direct mouth to ccp's ears about game development or (higher suspicion) believe that the devs pay less attention to the game development/ideas forum. if the latter is true then the issue that should be brought up in the csm assembly hall would be that developers play a more active part in their respective forums (hammer in gd and fi, greyscale in pve, ginger in igs etc etc) imvfho thats the difference between an idea and an issue."
12/12/2008,sorry :/i would also like to add that if you/anyone feels that a specific mechanic or feature is broken beyond its design or has an element of metagaming then that would also be moe towards an issue rather than an idea for development of gameplay.
12/12/2008,"110% agree if that is possible.if you have an issue and an idea to fix it then by all means post in ah, but we don't want to read another thread about ****ty new ship ideas."
12/12/2008,"poss are not abused as place holders. poss are allowed to place-hold, containers are not.first...there are only two qualifications for a system to be a 'good research system.' they are: there must be moons, and there must be a station with available offices. you don't need (and in some cases don't want) laboratory slots in the system because you're providing your own lab slots. available manufacturing slots can be a good bonus, but that's completely independent from your highsec pos.second...if someone wants to place 100-400 or more million isk in the form of a tower at risk of destruction in order to reserve a moon for later use, that shouldn't be countered by whining on a petition or activating a module. grow a pair and wardec. if you don't have the resources at your disposal (whether organic or for hire) to blow up an offline pos, you aren't ready to be in the pos game in the first place.third...learn the difference between shields and force fields. one is active only when the tower is online, the other is always active whether the tower is on- or offline.as for not being able to find an empty moon, gtfoo(whatever hub you're in). this summer i found plenty of empty moons when i was looking for places to anchor my towers...some only two jumps from jita."
12/12/2008,completely opposed to the change unless changes in sov system are made. it'd entirely change the cost/benefit scale of system defense only because some carebears are too lazy to go get a few torp ravens and pay a wardec fee to do the removal themselves.
12/12/2008,um the problem is it takes more than a few ravens to remove a large tower=======personally i think if the tower goes offline then it starts burning the stront bay to maintain the anchor and a few hours after that is gone the tower and all of it's mods unanchor and anyone with a big enough ship can scoop them.additionally if the tower goes offline the shields drop and the tower can be popped fairly quickly if you don't want to wait for the tower to unanchor itself.
12/12/2008,"get more friends, or more patience. offlined towers have a very specific tactical purpose in the game that's simply not going to be easily replaced. if you want a moon well enough, you should be willing to put the effort to take it, or pay someone."
12/12/2008,"i'd certainly like to be able to unanchor those offlined poses in my favourite mission hubs. the stations are maintained by one-man companies, why shouldn't a one-man company be able to take it away?"
12/12/2008,"but that means they have to maintain it, its no longer free"
12/12/2008,you're ******ed wardec the corp and shoot them it if its worth it to you there are ingame mechanics to make them go away shut up.
12/12/2008,just use a few cap stable amarr bs and go afk
12/12/2008,more standings? yep! ^^
12/12/2008,"ok granted, i don't mine on this toon, but something like that would be good... a capital ship which is a mining ship, not just a mining support ship (aka capital indust, indust command etc)"
12/12/2008,"i like the idea of a super capital industry platform, it could be like a titan for industry alliances/corps. i know the rorqual was welcomed into the industry community and has helped my alliance out quite a bit.as far as the ship goes, i think ccp could resize the typhoon model to super cap size and change the appearance some. i suggested the typhoon since it already has a hole in the middle of the front that the super cap indy would ""tractor"" roids into and process. could load the compressed bpo into the ""tractor"" module :-)fully supported, i might even train for it if ccp addes it to the list :-)"
12/12/2008,"thing is...lets say we get 100 of these things totally soaking up low end 0.0; where do these minerals go? the higher end ores becomes the bottleneck for these... so no real increase of mineral usage happens... except to build these ships themselves; but that's a pretty small increase. look at the orca's effect on minerals.unless you do mean to make this a super capital. like 15billion in minerals or more.in either case... those low end valued minerals could overwhelm the markets. the only way the market wouldnt totally crash would be in essence... insurance fraud; the act of building ships, just to insurance and kill.ps carebears do truly need to get some sort of huge price tag item.i want high sec outposts. so i could build one for my corp in a stationless system."
12/12/2008,"i am a miner and i would like to see something a little bigger then just a hulk. but... in my honest opinion, this would be bad, very bad for the market. because huge corps would sit there and flood the market with ore. right now average tritanium is going for 3.5 to 4.2 depending on where you go. honestly, if this came in to effect, well the price would go down really fast. i don't think that this would be such a good idea. give us something that's a little similar in size to an orca but that can mount like, 4 or 5 strip miners on it. that would be nice. :)"
12/12/2008,"no, we don't need any more ships to rip ore out of asteroid belts.if you're in the business of building capital ships, you can't be in the business of mining the resources on your own. you're in the business of securing those resources from people who have already mined it.work smarter, not harder, and all that jazz."

12/12/2008,pos's in general need major updates and fix's as well as the release of t2 moon miners.
12/12/2008,they didnt release because t2 was so crazy cheap now. release the t2 one and basically doubles the materials coming from moons and you simply flood the market.alchemy was created to release the bottleneck from t2 market but it hasnt actually been implemented ingame. as alchemy right now would do nothing.with this exploit out of the way now... the real value of moon mining will come out. alchemy will become an option.only when alchemy becomes quite widespread should the t2 moon miner be considered to being seeded.
12/12/2008,locked.please continue the discussion in the official thread.thank you.
12/12/2008,"cause its probably the best thing anyone at an mmo company has ever done.and with the amount of dedicated computer geniuses developing stuff for ever for free i can only imagine what eve's gui could become if only the gui were modable.just look at eft, eve commander, the killboard project, etc, so much free talent out there at ccp's disposal."
12/12/2008,"was a big topic of my csm campaign, and i wasn't the first. i agree fully - this is the single best change ccp could possibly make."
12/12/2008,"all ores should be available in all space, the ore in lowsec should give at least 2x that in highsec, and the ore in 0.0 at least 4x. it should be yield based improvement so that miners can perform their function of levelling out the mineral prices to around what they are supposed to be by just mining the most valuable at the time. also it would mean that even if external factors changed the price of minerals, lowsec would always be worth more than highsec.i can't see people mining in lowsec without at least a 2x incentive, currently it is a joke that lowsec mining has been less valuable than highsec since the drone regions were introduced (where nocxium and isogen flow in rivers because people droning can't choose their minerals so carefully). giving people an incentive to mine in lowsec means more targets, more traders, more targets, more miners etc etc. it also means more player-driven stability. which is of course the right way to regulate a market."
12/12/2008,short answer. yes. its important that isk sinks are item faucets and item faucets are isk sinks. this regulates prices within a set known bound and allows players to make informed long term decisions about production.
12/12/2008,"yeah i know this, but what i meant was, is the current arbitrary implementation the only safe way to do so. or would a dynamic luxury faucet just be the only magical faucet that would cause the eve economy to explode.basically, why would this be so much worse than pos fuel or insurance."
12/12/2008,"i don't know if i completely agree with the op regarding this. matter of fact, i don't think that i do.***the ishkur is perfect for what it does. it's one of the most vicious af's in-game and in the hands of a drone-master pilot with good skills, has no equal.the enyo needs another mid-slot desperately.***don't know about the other races. leave my ishkur alone."

12/13/2008,i'm all for this.i believe us many of us just created a casual character when we started just to check things out.after i had been in for a few months and started figuring out how eve worked i was reluctant to create a new characters and lose those months of training.if nothing else let it be a once in a lifetime. thing.keep the characters history and standings but change the name.
12/13/2008,per character/per account? so when you buy a character you can change the name of it?
12/13/2008,"stop claiming that it is too much work to redo the pos and do it already ccp! with the pos exploit this should be your priority: re-evaluation of pos and pos mechanics, making pos ""kiss"" compatible."
12/13/2008,"well, back2front for another swift push back to page 5."
12/13/2008,"i guess i am not the only one who got his account expired in the worst moment possible. i missed several organized events because of this and if you are not paying with credit card, reactivation takes some time. and you lose the option to use a concord pilot licence as well. so here it is: wouldn't it just be great if there was some sort of indication on the character selection screen about the date and time when your account expires? i think there is a similar notification already in this game, but only for trials... i doubt that it would take long to implement this for paying accounts as well."

12/13/2008,the csm cant 'force' ccp to do crap. so get those illusions out of your head already. if ccp wants to share info with us they will.
12/13/2008,i concur with the original poster. this is a csm job.
12/13/2008,i have to say... this has me very scared... to know that one of my past alliances may have dissolved simply because our enemies were cheating on a scale like this...

12/13/2008,"hello all,i agree that we should get some of the details of who/what/where/when/why/how. however, i'd rather have a complete and in-depth study of where the isk went and which alliances profited, and perhaps a penalty for such massive influx of isk, such as removing a few supercapitals if it was proven that the isk gained from the exploit went to fund such ships.despite having an information trail, this is still going to take some time to backtrack and confirm all transactions. i'm there beside you guys on this one, as i paid for my game time with gtcs bought via isk, and the influx of isk has caused me to pay more for them (since there was greater demand and less supply).i'll be there in the csm to get some answers, and promise to reveal everything i'm legally able to reveal to you as soon as the answers are concrete. i've cancelled my topics of interest so we can devote more time to finding out any information that is immediately available. i'd like to talk to the chief economist as to how far this went. i know alchemy will help compensate for the massive losses, but i'd also like to see some other changes to help the system out.right now, the 4 years thing is just what one poster has said, and there's no corroborative evidence (as his account got banned, etc). we also have to consider that one careless gm let this petition go for whatever reason, and ccp honestly didn't know about it until the lit match was dropped in the can of petrol.tl;dr: i want penalties to be applied and answers to the questions, but i want correct answers, and am willing to wait for an in-depth investigation before results are really known."

12/13/2008,this exploit did not act as an isk faucet which you suggest it does. the answer to all questions in regards to economy is that we have perfect competition. it means that the market will regulate itself extremely easily. i'm all for getting an idea about how many minerals were created out of thin air though.

12/13/2008,"everyone of you sure to admit that the developers of eve-online has wierd way of fixing things in eve.- as you know people yelling about this or that race has too powerfull weapons/ships/equipment and so on a programmer or responsible worker of the ccp takes this ""yelling"" applications to the higher officereve worker : sir we ahve people yelling crying at the forums that bla bla race has too much powerfull and those race's ships crushing them at pvpofficer : isnt their yelling because of their incapable of playing properlyworker : no sir they insist they know the game well but some how they are dieing, they are crying too much we had to do something, sir?officer : ok nerf what they wantthis isnt surely like this but the way of the nerfs is make us feel like this, here some exampleswhen 1 years ago they nerfed the torpedos as you know, on what purpose they have done it: ""torps are hitting too much"" ok what is the purpose of the torpedos- slow, not agile , high signature radius- delivering high pay-load to same size or higher size vesselsas you all know torps work like this and they nerfed it cause caldari race using torps at missions and earning good money from it and other races cant do the same. this is their problem. this race designed to be like this not designed to be close range combat race.if you reed the describtion of the caldari you'll see that caldari race mostly fighting from long range not close range their ships equipment designed to be like this.secondly they nerfed the tech 2 missiles. this was the stupist thing i have ever seen.you know the presicion missiles ok. whats in the purpose of these missles ""high speed, very agile but lacks damage"" what they have done ""heavy assault missiles can be fired at a greater rate than heavy missiles, at the expense of effective range"" ok here is the question fury missiles has more range, more damage, why should i use a missle of same kind that dont have the range and damage. and do you know why they have done this cause some of the gallente,minmatar and amarr nano or lets say whom play stile is based on speed) yelled about it cause these missiles can catch these guys at long range lets say 150-200 km (at that time these guys making 10.000 km/s with their ships). you remember the officer up thereofficer : nerf 'emnow gallente yelling about their blasters range and tracking speeds. can you believe this. they are saying because of the optimal and range of the blasters they cant kill the players properly they are saying. anyone playing eve long time all knows that blasters are the fastest way of killing a ship in this game.they supposed to be hit from close range you blody tankerts, they have designed to do that. what you want , want to hit with blasters from 50km. when ccp nerfed the caldari missiles most of the gallente players wrote to the forums ""haha suck caldari scums"" , at this point ccp hasnt even nerfed the blasters these guys yelling cause ccp nerfed the nano equipment so they cant get close enough to their prey without taken damage.these guys havent seen minmatar artilery cannons. these weapons have the worst tracking and the autocannons has the worsest optimal of the eve. do you know you have to get close 2-3 km near of your target to give max damage. think this while you are using a battleship even you have microwarp drive with a battleship you cant turn and get close to your target with that slow agilty and even you turn the microwarp drive of the bs is tremedeusly slow that your target leave only his fart at the back while he is on the way of his warp.so the main idea of this artical, ccp is making big mistake at nerfings, to make 10 people happy they are wasting thousands of players.worker : sir with these changes most of the people will be very upsetofficer : screw them they get used to it, we are making this kind of changes from 4 years, they all get used to it, and the dumbs still paying us while they are unhappy hahaha.?"
12/13/2008,crime and punishment is that way you can also find wow over here
12/13/2008,"this idea is fairly simply, but wide-reaching. the proposal is to audit the game mechanics for all item generating activities to make sure there are at least 2 game mechanics for getting the items, and to set alerts for practical maximum item generation.this is a form of ""insurance"" against game mechanic exploits and imbalances. alerts on practical maximum item generationtake the example of ferrogel production for the recently known moon mining exploit, the silos were filling in 1 day instead of 7 days. so every moon that was exploited was the equivalent of 7 moons. but since eg. dysprosium moons are rare, having an effective 50 x as many dyspro moons would stand out against maximum theoretical production - raising the alarm and prompting investigate.can anyone think of more examples where theoretical/practical max could be calculated?multiple mechanicsthis is a little more theoretical, but in the case where there are two mechanics, the rate of usage of the mechanics and player activity in the two mechanics can be compared, if players suddenly swing towards using method, then it is a prompt to investigate. tech ii bpos + invention, moon mining + alchemy are examples where this occurs. so the trick is to extend that approach to all item creation.can anyone thing of examples where this doesn't occur?pros* provides an earlier warning system to identify where ""unusual"" activity is going on that might be an exploit* less reliant on players ""doing the right thing"" and reporting exploits or escalating* less reliant on gms picking up on potential exploits or imbalances when investigating petitions* ??cons* reduces the geography of eve, by effecting conflicts over resource control; eg. when there are other mechanics it's not worth fighting over a moon.* ??related threads:a call for transparency regarding the reaction/pos exploitstarbase exploit addressed"
12/13/2008,forgot support :p
12/13/2008,"im sure we have all been there before, we trained a skill or set of skills thinking it would be a great idea and then we figure out that the skill set is not a wise decision. what if you could apply half of those skill points to another skill? the reason for the half is so that sp could not be farmed or anything.if this was allowed then some newer players could exchange some of their carebear skills in for fighting skills once they are in 0.0 space. for instance, if someone learned a lot of industrial skills but then decided that they hate it and want to shoot people, they should be able to transfer some of those skills over to another.if you are looking for the realism in this idea, if you learn to drive an suv, you can go into a sports car and mostly know how to drive it and vice versa. if this approach is better then the skills points could only be applied to related topics.some examples are:spaceship command transfered to other spaceship command skills. (caldari frigate to amarr frigate.)weapon skills should be somewhat transferable to one another. gunnery skills should able to transfer more points to other gunnery skills than gunnery to missles.skill points cannot completely transfer to prevent misuse."
12/13/2008,i'd be happy with just being able to get rid of stupid skills i trained that clog up my skills sheet.
12/13/2008,this was actually implimented in another mmo called asheron's call.
12/13/2008,"is anybody reading what is suggested here or are you just reading topic, going in and screaming ""no wow!!!!! ahhh the sky will fall!!!""it's about getting a additional limited amount of sp while playing the game and not that you have to grind the game to gain any sp.this could help newer players, or shorten the time of a lvl5 skill. in the end it can benefit you for playing the game and not sitting around and watching a countdown. cause of my corp, i know lots of new players which have the problem that they are stucked with lvl3 missions and waiting for a bs to progress a bit. they ask themselfe, why they should log in, they have enough money (and will get much more with lvl4) and are just waiting for the next step. or miners which are waiting for the mining barge skill to complete.still supported from my side."
12/13/2008,"i'd love to have something to do in eve right now. i've mined till my eyes bled. i've run missions until the agents' text ran together in great torrents of alphabet soup. i'm just so thankful i've got this list of skills to look at while i (patiently) count the seconds for the next several weeks. i'd love to be able to contribute something great, i mean something really memorable. unfortunately i wasn't playing eve when it launched so i'm stuck in the shadow of those who were until they get bored and quit........here's to hope. i support the idea."
12/13/2008,"hmm, i always thought the four asterisks in your original post meant something a bit more than 'actively,' especially when paired with 'out of myself.' in my more than 10 years playing mmos, powerlevelers in other games don't 'play actively,' they stop playing anything other than those things that gain them levels. at their worst, they're afk-scripting zombies...at their best, they're atk-scripting zombies.either way, that counts as abuse. maybe you don't do that, but then you'd completely fail at powerleveling the 'anything' out of yourself."
12/13/2008,this would get people to play eve more and we might even get a skill que. since ccp is arguing with a skill que we wont log in to play.
12/13/2008,good idea. the data is just being categorised i am amazed at the amount of data recorded already personally. also extra support for phoenix cheering on his idea.
12/13/2008,"a new player who has skilled into and purchased an assault frigate is unlikely to have also skilled into and purchased a destroyer. given that the af ought to be able to do the job, i see no reason why we should force the new players, who are just about the only ones doing l1 missions, out of their comfort zone. yes, the af-users are a small group, but that's no reason to hurt them unduly."
12/13/2008,they are frigates.
12/13/2008,considering its very easy and far cheaper to pilot a destroyer... let alone skill one up... i still fail to see why this is such a big deal.but i concede as there really isn't a reason to lock out any ships... i should be able to fly my battleship in there too : o pbut i figured the dev's thought otherwise..../signed.
12/13/2008,"there may be a disparity between whether it is fair to let them in (intended game mechanics) and whether it is logical in-game (restrictions based on size, not meta level).i initially leaned towards restricting by ship size only, using the argument that accelerator gates would be able to fling a t2 frigate if they can fling a destroyer. i usually hate any sort of artificial barrier.however, gates with this restriction are crucial for both pve and pvp reasons. they serve two roles: the first making sure the mission itself is challenging, and the second ensuring that if a missioner does encounter a intruding player, at least they won't be severely outclassed in ship type (i think a t1 frig would be destroyed 95% of the time in this situation).if t2 frigs are allowed through l1 acceleration gates, while they do allow for mission blitzing by older players, i think that the safety of brand new players is much more important here."
12/13/2008,"why shouldn'y i be able to run a level-1 mission in a damn assault frigate? i skilled one, didn't i? destroyers suck for everything, period.screw their *safety*. eve is supposed to be a cold dark place."
12/13/2008,why would you even bother doing lvl 1 missions in assault frigs when you can do lvl 3's in those?
12/13/2008,"oh, i'll agree that destroyers are better for most newbies than afs. i just don't expect newbies to play optimally."
12/13/2008,"nah, lvl 1 complexes are for noobs, noobs don't fly tech2.q.e.d."
12/13/2008,"unless it's been changed recently, assault frigates can enter worlds collide lvl 1.and most lvl1 missions don't have any shipsize restrictions."
12/13/2008,they're newbs... optimization and newb don't work in the same sentance!x o d
12/13/2008,exactly my point
12/13/2008,"is it possible for non-csm members to ""attend"" the meeting in a listen-only mode, or to hear a recording of the meeting? as a least-prefeered alternative, will the minutes of the meeting be made available to the public at large?thanks!"
12/13/2008,were the in-game characters/corps/alliances of any past/present ccp developers associated with the banned accounts?thanks!
12/13/2008,"going forward - is there an ""audit"" type of system that ccp could put in place where the manufacture of items does not align to the resources available? getting something for nothing seems to be somtheing that should be easy to catch.thanks!"
12/13/2008,name and shame doesn't work and has been tried on other online games.
12/13/2008,"no, csm has had to sign nda's to cover the possibility that ccp devs/gm's may mention something that cannot be made public, having members of the general playerbase there would negate the point of the nda. yes, but it may be a little moderated depending on where the conversations take us."
12/13/2008,"after the fail of midas i wanna know if there will be another industrie addon, maybe with a contract or a log for shares, maybe those fuelpellets and other things discussed.we shouldn't forget everything else, cause of this exploit thing."
12/13/2008,"often in the past, these minutes from ccp & csm meetings have been seriously delayed, i hope that csm can impress upon the ccp reps, that attend the meeting, it behooves them to get those minutes out to the public asap, so negate the rabble rabble."
12/13/2008,"obviously there's the t2 exploit thing.... how does t2 bpos compare to invention now that the base items are going to be far more scarce and thusly the advantage of invention of high units decreasing cost... how does that fit in? could be a significant issue.1. how is wreck flagging in pvp going? i kill someone outside jita 4-4 i'm not going to get anything that drops.2. freighter sized ship for moving loads of rigged ships?3. remote sensor damps need some love.4. low sec fix for concord? something like this?5. pirate faction ships? rogue drones dominix? sisters epic cov-op ship; one capable of being essentially cloaked when it isnt.6. high sec outposts?7. invention/drone implants?8. fix to wardecs... 2mil to essentially annoy people?9. pos fuel? in features area they had the idea of creating pos fuel to be streamlined into 3 items at most. yes or no?10. fix for stealth bombers?11. black ops? sin needs more targetting range.12. gallente navy ogres, amarr navy praetors?13. slightly shorter jumpclone time. such that if you spend only a few hours a day online, you arent stuck.14. eve stock market!15. suicide ganking and insurance. 16. battle recorder."
12/13/2008,17. alluring emanations; level 4 mission that's easier to finish then any level 1 mission.18. mining misappropriate; level 4 mission that amarr agents gives to go kill amarr ships. not good?
12/13/2008,"hello all,we'll raise these questions, but i'm not sure how many answers we'll get as it's so early in the investigation. regardless, we'll try to get these things answered, as i can vouch for the rest of my csm compatriots that this is first and foremost on our list of problems to get solved. the other stuff can wait for a different meeting if necessary."
12/13/2008,regarding the exploit: i think that csm members should make a priority list (for themselves) of the things they think have to be addressed. and then not to leave the meeting(s) without either: ccp having clarified how and when they are going to reveal the demanded/requested information or being convinced themselves that its better that ccp doesn't reveal (some of) the information in order to convince us in turn.no doubt these meetings will be the most important to date and we expect you not to walk out without a red face due to putting serious pressure on ccp to reveal as much information as needed.m.m.
12/13/2008,"my main question is,will they make future exploits that appear or existing ones that are not yet known... be a priority in fixing as they'e found out about?can they do anything to encourage the user base that might be aware of existing exploits to come forth and tell ccp about the exploits they might be using without fear of being banned.example, alliance x is using a meathod to make a lot of isk and isn't sure if what they're doing is an exploit. out of fear of both being banned and losing their source of income they keep it a secret.kind of the way profitable trade routes are kept hush hush, out of fear of losing said trade route to the masses. (i'm not saying trade routes are exploits but rather an example of something that players keep information about to themselves)to summarize what i'm asking...what will ccp do to catch and handle more exploits.what will ccp do to encourage players to admit the ones they know about?"
12/13/2008,"we have scheduled a csm ""thunderdome"" with ccp sunday! only the csm will emerge alive!seriously, the csm is engaged with ccp and my impression is that ccp is willing to be very open with the csm. remember, intimate details are not likely to emerge but i feel ccp will act in a way that shows they are committed to a fair eve for all. i feel that the transperancy everyone has called for will happen, the reaction of the csm to this development has been impressive. all of the csm sees the seriousness of the issues and seems committed to making ccp accountable. in the mean time, know this is still the best game in the verse! hang on, hang in and count on this being settled once and for always!issler"
12/13/2008,what t2 bpo's were removed from the game due to this incident?
12/13/2008,"a) fixes to make t2 ammo worthwhile, or at least a lot more balanced against faction which does the same thing, without nerfs?b) fixes to the war declaration system enabling amicable surrenders?c) fixes to the war declaration system that flags members of the declared corps so that jumping is not an immediate immunity flag?d) fixes to npc corps to prompt players to move outward toward player corporations?e) not touching ecm, but making ecm countermeasures more feasable?f) more streamlined exploration methods to remove some drudgery?g) streamlined pos logistics? fuel rods, multiple items anchoring/unanchoring simultaneously?h) pos material bays that all modules within the shield can access (re: assembly arrays, labs) to mitigate material shifting for every joblot."
12/13/2008,skill-queue ?macroers ?insurance payout when concorded (best thing would be to get rid of insurance alltogether imho)
12/13/2008,the daft thing is though that i have unfortunatly heard all of this before ive been playing since 2003 and this is not the first time this has happend
12/13/2008,"my question would be:will ccp apologize for their rushed way to remove ghost training without making sure everybody will know about this ""fix"" in time?"
12/13/2008,please be aware that this meeting is only about the recent exploit. we are not discussing anything other than that. we will be doing that in january.
12/13/2008,"what is the projected effect on the economy. what are the steps taken to prevent economic turmoil and market panic if such would arise.in short: you (ccp) have found mr. exploit and killed him, what are you going to do with the corpse?and on top of that: will there be any new mechanisms introduced to prevent this in the future? fear of the banhammer is obviously a lousy preventive measure."
12/13/2008,when exactly will the meeting take place (server time)? and when do you expect to be able to give us an initial briefing about how it went?
12/13/2008,the meeting is sunday 1600 gmt. we have no idea when you will hear about the result of it. it's up to ccp really.
12/13/2008,can we get a transcript of the questions and statements they are allowed to give us answers on?
12/13/2008,"this is essentially the same as a skill queue system, except that it lets people get a jump on a skill from a new patch. i'd rather just have a proper queue implementation than this system - it does the same job more effectively."
12/13/2008,"there are three major suggestions floating around in the skill queue threads: - simple queuing. finish one skill, start the next. - simultaneous training. each skill trains at 1/x of full speed (x is the number of skills training). when one finishes, the rest speed up. - training time backdating. the idea you propose here.how would you idea work with people who change implants and/or clone jump while accumulating time via this system ?note that clone jumps and implant changing require your skills to be paused."
12/13/2008,"the first and second one will allow someone to stay away for 6 months or longer. one could create a char, set the queue, and forget about it for a year, just pay the bill. we'd have many unused accounts for a long period of time and then all of a sudden these superplayers start to come alive. seems wrong. i can see why they don't implement a queue.i proposed more of a short term buffer for regularly active players that simply forget, or cannot change their skill once in a while (life gets in the way). it wouldn't be unfair or too great of an impact if you could save up some time (max 24h or so) and apply it to the skill of choice. the time missed vs the changed implants could be calculated when you apply the time to a skill. you could also limit it to just one skill. say you want a skill of 17 hours trained, and you saved up 24 hours, then you'd lose the 7 hours, unable to apply that to another skill. you would still lose time, but not as much, and you would also get your skill done that you forgot to set (like i did in post 1)."
12/13/2008,"why not? they pay hard earned cash treat it like its an investment... if you can only afford a vw today, and save for a fererri why not just put the money away and invest it till you can afford one."
12/13/2008,"yes, the current system is very very annoying"
12/13/2008,"isk, seems to be entirely generated by the destruction of ""red crosses"". the ecconomy seems to be entirely run by npc bashing. therefore i suggest that every player is in fact a ""carebear"". also the majority of the people playing eve live nice protected lives in rl empires. again, we are all carebears.adhocracy...i love it!"
12/13/2008,deffo. supported.
12/13/2008,"yes, i won eve, you can all go home now. thank god/ccp we the players don't develop the game."
12/13/2008,why do the tactical issues need to be negated?
12/13/2008,"possibly not negated, but they need to be considered.because it doesn't have a 24 hour timer like a jump clone, or expose you to risk during travel like a shuttle does.so if e.g. you're station-camped without an up-to-date clone, being able to take the interbus to escape might be unbalancing."
12/13/2008,only supported if you see the buses flying in space and can blow them upotherwise something like this would lessen the use of shuttles which play a major factor in the price of trit
12/13/2008,"i don't see why this can't be discussed in the original (holoprojector) thread. it is addressing the same problem, after all.as i said in that thread: this is an attempt to deal with a symptom, not the underlying problem. i think this is a better suggestion than the holoprojector one, but that it is still detrimental in many ways to a development of post-ambulation eve."
12/13/2008,"i definitely wouldn't be mining nor running missions, so i'm not sure what your question is here.as i'm no parasite, i'm not owed anything. i work for my isk, same as mission runners and the same as miners, pvp'ers and pirates. the trick is, mission runners complain because they're not able to buy their gtcs as easily when i'm around. you know why ccp won't change the mechanic? i'm saving them rl money, that's why.i see mission runners as the parasites. they leech off the system, easily taking little-to-no risk during their missions, and wanting to be left alone. at the end of their term, they look at their isk supply and say, ""here, let me take this little chunk here and buy another gtc on the market"".me? i need to haul out the ole wallet and actually pay for mine.i don't want them to quit. personally, i want them to continue whining and crying and making threads like this. i get a kick out of it, just like i get a kick out of your nerdrage post.see my point above for why ccp will always (always) support what we do. and you can bow down and respect me for having the balls to keep a corporation running that is dedicated to it, and not hide out in an npc corp.see - there's a difference between you and i. i don't hide my corp name like you do. ""post with your main"" if you want to be heard, son. if not, you're only fueling my fire, because i'm not afraid to speak out, and people respect that."
12/13/2008,"there is risk to ninja salvage even if you don't steal from wrecks and get aggro.there is risk you are wasting your time. maybe you won't be able to probe an salvaged mission out. not all risk has to be loss of ship.some people don't have the skillpoints to run lvl 4 missions, but they can probe and salvage. they want to maximize their isk earned, it is basic game theory.i have ninja salvaged and enjoy having ninja salvagers around - much less boring than pure pve but you actually have to think to beat them :pa) bring a friend - it is a mmo after all interacting with people is kind of the thing. friend salvages as you go ad bonus he can use a tractor beam.b) shot the wrecks - no wrecks, no ninjas. especially good to shot just as they get to the wreck. usually they will leave before you destroy the whole room because they are in it for isk. if they don't leave start getting worried.c) even if you had aggro would you use it? risky, you're in a pve ship after all and by shooting him (remember you don't have scram) u give him free reign to shoot you for 15 minutes. he may be in a thrasher now but the chances are non-zero he has neut domi just waiting to loot ur mission ship's wreck.basically ninja looting adds dynamic to pve, i think it adds to eve. fight for your loot, fighting is more than just pressing f1."
12/13/2008,i'm a carebear and ya... motsu-dodixie are no go systems for missions.the system i mission in peaks around 100 people on weekends. normally 40 or so people... maybe another 20 in surrounding systems. i havent had anyone scan me down... in which case if they did i would likely invite them to gang me. i wouldnt mind the gang bonuses :) they get to tractor and salvage and lewt all they want.last few days in local people are complaining about 2 different people scanning them down.so it does technically happen almost everywhere.
12/13/2008,"i do ninja-salvaging myself, and i have to admit its ridicolous, because there is absolutely no risk!the op is not talking about motsu, he is talking about salvaging.i know ccp will not change it, but still, the op is right."
12/13/2008,"what they do need to fix is the damn wreck flagging mechanic.currently if i blow someone up and some prat comes along and loots their wreck, they don't flag as hostile too me, only to the idjit i just popped. the only way to nail loot thieves is to flip into a can as soon as the wreck drops.imo salvaging should earn the same flag... or even attempting to salvage. if you activate your salvager, i get to shoot you, pure and simple."
12/13/2008,"sure you do.the op is a fool, and so are you if you think anyone's falling for your lies and stupidity.look for the thread in assembly hall by the pitboss. he's asking for this exact thing, and i recommend putting your support in there as well. i did, as that mechanic is definitely broken.no. pure and simple. you have the loot, the wreck is owned by whoever activates a salvager on it first. if you didn't bring one, i did."
12/13/2008,resolved
12/13/2008,"well ... the bug report system... needless to say i've had a ccp fellow talk to me about bug reports... and then i gave him 2-3 id #s for bug reports and then i wasnt in trouble anymore... but rather he just wanted me to stfu about the system.i kept bug reporting... then maybe 3-4 of my bug reports in a row... simply got filtered... nothing said in them... fool me once... shame on you.fool me twice... and fool cant get fooled again.-gwbushoh and ironically.. 2 of those bugs are still ingame.anyway...ya pretty much sounds exactly what happened to you. though by the looks of things? you did get a response?a bh said?the problem you have described as an intended game feature, and not a bug.that's a little messed up. i kind of would prefer them saying nothing to outright saying this isnt a bug."
12/13/2008,"could be that this system is broken, or at least not working as intended.does anyone else have recent examples of bug reporting being dismissed without any real vaule being placed out your report?link it here.maybe if there are enogh cases, csm could look into this also."
12/13/2008,this needs an explanation from ccp.
12/13/2008,so no one else has received a similar brush off from a bug report?
12/13/2008,"actually, with the recent pos exploit, i've already been planning to talk to ccp about this during our iceland meeting. it's now obvious that there's a problem with the way the bug reporting has been handled, and ccp admitted to as much in their article on the exploit. i sense some major changes on the bug reporting department will be handled here shortly, but i'll be there doing my best to get something done for the playerbase."
12/13/2008,"want to see something really silly (broken)?get a plated slow ass bs, and an interceptor. align both to a warp object 10au away, and tell them both to warp at the same moment.the battleship will arrive sooner because it only decelerates from 3au/s and does so far closer to its destination than the inty, which starts decellerating considerably further away, and does so for far longer. a cov ops, for example, can take 20 seconds just to come out of warp, whereas a freighter takes 5.end result = no difference in warp speeds except when at full warp."
12/13/2008,"there was a big thread on this a while back. i could have sworn it was submitted to ccp, but apparently not. still, given that it's still open and has 119 thumbs, i'd put this there."
12/13/2008,i'm not too bothered about redoing my overview but a massive 'yes!' to the second proposalthree thumbs up
12/13/2008,"might i suggest that if you are undertaking any operation in any high or low sec system you first check the status of all your gang mates, y'know their sec status, active wars ; that kind of thing. stop whining and realise you have just learned a valuable lesson in pvp."
12/13/2008,"now there i can agree with you - i don't even remember how to find it most of the time. call it item #563,512 on the ui fixes list."
12/13/2008,thank you for the support
12/13/2008,thank you for the support.changing the default to 0 isk would ruin the very point of having a cspa service charge.

12/13/2008,1. wth do these ships require frigate v?????2. i still think the theater command need the ability to run a 3rd link. i think this could be off set with a warfare link specialization v requisite. it would also help justify buying a battleship that costs more than a carrier.3. why do the caldari get half the drone bay of all the other ships?
12/13/2008,signed and approved. this game always seems to get better the more it resembles homeworld 2 (which is win). for this to be implemented would be another step in the right direction (probably).

12/13/2008,"inflation rates of zero are not achieved when the net rate of monetary growth is zero. the price level is the equilibrium rate of exchange between money and goods, thus when both money and goods increase at the same rate, price levels will be maintained. the rate of money supply growth in eve is, last i heard, about 200 billion per day(500-odd in, 300-odd out), or about 0.2% per day. that's a lot, of course - close to a doubling per year - but between the ever-increasing player base and the ever-increasing wealth of the average player, the goods supply actually increases slightly faster than the money supply. the qens have shown a continual process of long-term deflation, albeit a pretty slow one, a few percent a month tops. i haven't been able to find the economic video yet(link please?), and i'll revise that statement if things have changed since the last qen data, but at present the best data i have says that, if anything, the money supply isn't increasing quite fast enough. as for your comments about how losing a battleship used to be worse, i think that shows pretty clearly how fundamentally backwards you have things. for one, most of the reason a battleship is cheaper today is that we've got better sources of stuff today - the best mining ship in the era you refer to was an unboosted apocalypse. a boosted hulk is well over twice as good a miner(and invulnerable to can theft), making battleships cost less than half as many man-hours. second, and more fundamentally, you're hearkening back to an era when prices were higher than they are today, and advocating deflationary policies as the solution. you want higher prices, and are trying to cut the money supply to get them. and then you bring out the idea of a luxury mineral exit. aside from the fact that motherships already exist, i'd just like to point out that if you do this properly you'll just cancel out the effects of your previous suggestion. your policy proposal here seems to be making ships both cheaper and more painful to lose, by advocating deflationary policies that will keep the price level stable. it reminds me of nothing more than the joke about the (member of an easily mocked group), who keeps coffee and popsicles in their thermos because it keeps hot things hot and cold things cold. you're pursuing fundamentally contradictory goals because you have no idea what you actually want, and you're haring off in all directions to find a solution to a problem that nobody but you seems to have and that you can't solve. i try to avoid getting bogged down in fiskings, because they never seem to solve anything, but your ideas are so fundamentally wrong that i can't help it. your goals are ill-defined and contradictory, your methods don't achieve them, and you don't seem to have given any of this enough thought to realize it. stop, sit back, and analyze the eve economy as an economy, not as a series of unrelated entries on your wish list. once you've figured out what's possible to do with the economy as a whole (warts and all), decide what you want, and then you can proceed to have a sensible discussion about monetary policy. until then, please, just don't."
12/13/2008,"well i know what i want and i know it would work, but im messing up my verbage i guess.i'll talk like a baby about the stuff i fully understand less i annoy the economists.perception 1: after the initial investment of getting the pos tower and modules, the price (or fuel) of producing moon minerals is isk. i'm viewing isk as a material now. the more isk in eve universe, the more available moon minerals are, the more available tech 2.derived perception 1: so if there are more isk faucets, it will lead to less isk staying in eve universe per day. the less isk staying in system per day, the slower tech 2 becomes more available. with rippling secondary effects.perception 2: asteroid minerals are a part of pretty much everything in eve. the more available the minerals, the more available pretty much everything in eve becomes. not everyone can fly motherships or wants to leave empire to fly one. and we sure as hell don't need everyone in a titan by 2010. if you could get normal everyday ships to become more attractive to the common player by pumping more minerals into them. i have a lot of isk but i really have no desire or ability to fly a capital, just for example. anyways, that would increase potential mineral demand by pretty much everyone.derived perception 2: i believe that with a potentially higher demand for minerals, assuming the amount being mined stayed the same, then pretty much everything in eve would become less accessible, or at least slow down the rate at which everything in eve becomes more accessible. that is, if the current mineral production chains can support to supply everyone in eve with a battleship a day, and if that capability is becoming more potent daily, then a higher mineral demand would slow down the growth of that capability, or even reverse it.perception 3: if you make a ridiculously good item way better than anything else and sell it from an npc at really really high prices that continue to rise until they are at a price that nobody i willing to pay, then the richest, or most irresponsible, players in eve will be the ones spending their isk on it.derived perception 3: if its a really good item way better than anything else then a lot of players will want to buy it. if the price stays as high as the highest bidder is willing to pay, it should have the highest effect on making the most wealthy in comparison to everyone else in eve. or what i originally called leveraging wealth.derived derived perception 3: the players that have an interest in this npc sold luxury item, if all of their wealth becomes somewhat even or level, then the price would probably become low enough to where the amount of isk exiting eve universe through this method shouldn't threaten to crash tech 2 markets, yet hopefully slow down the overall tech 2 capacity growth.perception 4: eve's producers and consumers adapt to changes in the market supply and demand.derived perception 4: consumers would cope with the tighter spending, and producers would enjoy their seller's market and hopefully have more fun trying to rise to the challenge to meet the new dynamic demands.i didn't know how to word it at first, but i think my goal would be described as wanting to slow down if not reverse eve's economic growth, for purpose of lowering eve online's barrier of entry as far as pvp is concernedand of course that means my perceived problem with eve's pvp is that it eats newer players alive. tech 2 command ships vs tech 1 cruisers, etc. older players losing battleships like they're tech 1 frigates, newer players losing a battleship and it being devastating.i realize that for the purposes of gaining isk or mining ore that newer players will always be slower, but with a weaker economy at least they might encounter a fleet of enemies that might possibly have a few older player flying tech 1 in there. :p"
12/13/2008,"i stopped reading right there.1. hersh is right2. its not isk you're looking for, its timefurthermore, i don't think you understand the basics of supply and demand."
12/13/2008,does isk not buy pos fuel from npcs? and that fuel is at a set price right?
12/13/2008,"some portions, yes. is that isk a limiting factor in making moon materials?good lord, no.is that isk a negligible part of making moon materials? good lord, yes."
12/13/2008,"well the ccp economist said that most of the isk leaving the system was through pos fuel.additionally i don't know if what you're talking about is, would moon minerals still be worth mining, and i don't doubt that they would be. when i say less accessible i dont necessarily mean the end goal supply being in danger, but from a player perspective. or the demand part perhaps. somebody has to be having less isk.for a silly, super-ultra-deluxe contrast comparison, what if there were 0 isk in system? tech 2 would be outright unattainable right? and if you drug the slide-bar of isk supply from 0 to infinite, tech 2 would become more and more attainable until its accessibility becomes limited only by the finite number of moons/time right?thats all i meant to suggest, don't know if accessibility is the appropriate word maybe."
12/13/2008,"if the rate of increase for items and isk is the same then no, you don't prices will stay stable.prices are actually falling slightly so we know that isk is entering less fast than items. which means that more isk would actually be good."
12/13/2008,"but somebody would have less isk, while pos fuel's floor remains the same, prices/profits be damned.more isk would be good right now if you want more economic growth."
12/13/2008,there are some things that people never agree on - this is of course normal. i would encourage the posters to move to other topics if certain ones don't seem to be going anywhere. are there additions you'd like to make to the fleet warfare proposals (these ones are already up).
12/13/2008,i like for ui improvements but if the ui simply became modable all of that **** would probably be better implemented by a player-developer.
12/13/2008,"yes, if you take isk out of the system, somebody would have less of it. where you get ""profits be damned"" or any relation whatsoever to economic growth, though, i have no idea."

12/14/2008,"i am really partial on this. the thing is that i have a strong dislike for stupid character names.the other thing is that i also have a strong dislike for stupid players.so on one hand, an option to change names might reduce the number of stupid character names. however, it would rob me of the sadistic pleasure of knowing, that all those with a stupid character name are stuck with it forever as some kind of never ending punishment, stigmatizing them to everyone as puberty's finest.of course it would only be fair to give everyone a second chance at some point. people grow up, after all. it would be better if they could do the growing up part elsewhere first, but the world is not perfect. eventually, there is a simple solution, in my opinion:allow players to change their character's name when the trial time ends. once you start your paid time, the game could remind players that they will be stuck with their name, nothing to be done about it, unless they change it now.since i have absolutely no sympathy for bought/sold characters, i do not have a suggestion for their case. that option is a blight anyway."

12/14/2008,"about a year ago, a pretty impressive pvp alliance with rotating corp membership set about wardeccing every player corp under the sun in high sec to ""bring pvp back"". players who were just getting started in player corps, people taking a break from the endless pvp drama of high sec, industrial corporations, all of them. they took it upon themselves to abuse the mechanics on a pretty epic scale to remold high sec into what their ""ideal"" vision of eve should be. non-consentual pvp spread as widely as possible. some of them felt that if you were in a player corporation, you should be forced to pvp. ccp took exception to this interpretation and implemented the changes.i think they were at nearly a hundred simultaneous war declarations active at their peak. during the last push before the patch, they might have pushed that to nearly 150."

12/14/2008,"this may be coming from the far side of the universe, or has been discussed by enough politians to make it no longer a valid point of discussion, but i thought that it was worth putting something out there regarding this as a possible option to add more to the gameplay aspect, other than the normal pod for profit adventures.here's the gist of what i'm thinking. normally when i go hunting moons for possible pos site to make money from i inevitably find moons that have all the makings for terraforming and nothing worth my time in mining (ie atmospheric gases, hydrocarbons, and silicates). now while i'm not arguing to do away with these moons as mining options as some things require said goods, i can safely say that most corps avoid these as they do not turn over a profit on their own right away. instead i thought, hey why not invent a new type of ship that can drop a colony pod planet side (or moon since both seem less than used in more cases then they are) and set up a for profit colony loyal to the faction they reside in but paying taxes to the corp that serves them. additionally they could start some manufacturing and possibly grow (face it, even in story mode for our readers people still live on rocks orbiting stars, not just in stations and pods). this allows for the rapid growth of new skills available, new equipment invented and used, and even uses of already existing skills in both corporation, leadership, science, and spaceship command. what more is that it can fit several story arcs we read about but have no influence in. the minmitar republic's recent additions to the fold being an outstanding example. the mechanics wouldn't change as it can be similar to probe launches and ship operations would be the same. it would then make use of all the rocks out there that no one uses or cares about. additionally planets can be used for more than just battlefields destroying a colony should be just another type of colony pod that instead is set for war (destruction) more than settlement (creation). planets, depending on resources, could have up to 4 colonies (it's a ****ing planet) verses a moon with 1 or 2 depending on size (look at our moon for an example, mcdonalds already own property there). defences could be installed to make it as impregnable that most pos's, perish the thought that a floating manufacturing facility is capable of fending off a full scale naval assault, nukes included, but that is a separate rant. all in all it would make more space both useful and eventful, unless you think that pirating is an event that keeps things lively enough and adds to general world continuity.before anyone gets on the bandwagon to sound off about how bad this post is for downing pirating in a sci-fi mmo let me first say i'm not against it, just a personal rant about game story of muted stability versus actual actions. please ignore the portions that disenchant you and take the topic of new gameplay expansion idea seriously for both positive and negative feedback, or ideas on how to create such a system that would put less stress on developers so that it could be placed in action smoothly and quickly."

12/14/2008,"been arround a while myself and have attempted to quit playing several times but the drug that is eve keeps calling me back, i do love the game and i have to say i dont think a new clean server is the answer to the issues that have been arround for the exploits and disadvantages that some people have. people will aways find a loop hole in a computer program such as this and exploit it regardless if its a new or old server.i myself have a whole set of different issues with the game and most of them fall in the i need something new and exciting catagory (which doesnt mean something as useless to the game as walking in stations) or the catagory of you hit a road block in the progression of your gaming by some of the larger or older alinces/corporations in eve.i suppose on these issues i have to much to say and feel to strongly about them to be able to put them in a mere forum post. but agreed, something needs to happen in eve for it to keep my interest and my account active."

12/14/2008,there's a chineese server isn't there?seems like a shard to me....unfair that the chineese can have thier own server but nobody else can.
12/14/2008,not 100% sure if i'd play as hardcore as i did in 2003 - but starting over with the same sp as low level goons would be one hell of a challenge. would keep me excited for at least a year again.thanks for the contribution.j
12/14/2008,"china has their own server for political reasions, e.g. censorship etc.."
12/14/2008,i'd like to have our own server for fairness reasons. eg - see op.:)
12/14/2008,"not supported.edit: what do you think, how many people would join your new server?"
12/14/2008,"no!no new server/sharddo you think the new server will be filled with angels?its part of software life, thousands of line of code written by humans,used by humans...someone will always find loop holes, the trick is to fix them."
12/14/2008,"but over the years, loop holes have been fixed.i want an eve which starts with all the known holes fixed. i think that would make an enjoyable game which many would enjoy, knowing that past exploitation has not made currents gains and and achievements.just imagine the scramble to all that fresh new territory, and a fresh political map to work with.i'll pay for that, and i'm guessing many others would too.i'd still play on tranq now and then, but my main fun would come from the new universe to conquer/destroy/fight/exploit."
12/14/2008,"no, it's really not."
12/14/2008,"i will point out that new loop holes will likely be discovered as new content is released, nothing will likely change there. there will indeed be a scramble for 0.0 but i will predict that within a month or two everything on the new sever would be back to the original status quo--0.0 being controled by a few well organaized powerblocks.in short, this new shard would change nothing but fragment the playerbase."
12/14/2008,"i like the idea. i'd like everybody to be a noob again, and fight in tech1 (read cheap) ships. 1v1's might even become something you actually see out there again.a few adjustments should be made though. i used to like the time based skill system because it prevented people from ""having"" to grind the system and it forced people to focus on the game instead, which is still a good thing, but nowadays i'm not so sure i like that people only get better and better. the fact that so many pilots now have uber-skills isn't exactly making the game more interesting. i'm not sure how to change all this, but surely there's some issues with the skillsystem that ccp would have prefered they had made different in the first place, issues that they are now stuck with - take fx the learning skills. i started this character doing learning skills for 4 months, that's just bad gamedesign. learning skills should be taken out of the game on an eve2 shard. there's prolly other stuff that could be done differently making a better game in total, but also a bet ""end-game"" for us vetarans in there, who have done it all allready."
12/14/2008,after careful consideration on your proposal ive come to the following conclusion which i feel is most appropriate.get ****ed!
12/14/2008,"no. simply no. not for immersion, not for realism and not making any sense anyway.we all learn things, buy things, eat things, drink things or say things that we may regret later. that is life. deal with it.eventually, you can never know whether or not something might be useful later.i trained a lot of industrial skills a while ago. then i regretted doing so, because i found mining and industry increasingly boring. so i skilled up on fighting skills. if there had been the option to recycle those 'wasted' skillpoints, i would have done so. yet i would have bitten myself in the behind now, because all of a sudden, i found new applications for my industrial skills and started doing those things again.in addition, one way or another, it would be exploited and i alone can think of multiple ways to do so."
12/14/2008,there's already a completely adequate way to achieve your end goal. see? not supported.
12/14/2008,"no. if you want to do something else, just train for that too."
12/14/2008,no. you make your choice and live with the consequences!
12/14/2008,as it should be.
12/14/2008,"and as the nerfbat swings round and round, we all can forsee our given choices and consequences ?"
12/14/2008,solution: don't train fotm.
12/14/2008,"then you just train up whatever hasn't been nerfed. and if the nerfbat swings back the other way, you still have the skills trained."
12/14/2008,additional in game tools for command would definitely be useful and easing the admin required would help more.
12/14/2008,"good idea, however coloring those ""fixed"" positions only is often not a good idea, because it happens quite often that the *real* fc is not in a squad / wing / fleet leader position. i suggest that the fleet boss should be able to assign text colors to any of the pilots in the fleet, so that the real acting fc can get a color even if he's not the one in the fleet commander position."
12/14/2008,"just a point, this isnt a very useful suggestion. you'll find players occupying those slots are selected based on gang boosters that they can provide and usually have no bearing on the actual command structure."
12/14/2008,"considering the fact that eve is a science fiction based game and not a sword and sorcery game where you have to ride your pet horse to the neighboring village to see if they have x type of thingy for sell.....i would propose that the range and granularity of buy and sell orders be modified to allow:a prospective buyer to search the entire universal market for items.a prospective buyer to search all of low sec and high sec for items.a prospective buyer to search only high sec for items.in a ""wired"" world set in a far off future this would only make sense and would not prevent travel in fact it would probably increase regional travel and also be a good tool for market traders who travel the spacelanes looking for that ""best buy"".it might even ease up the jita hordes who have to haul there mins to jita for the bulk sells to the marketplace.in addition, the same type options for buy orders would be highly useful and promote more outside of small radius buying. if a person could for example place a universal buy order for anywhere in high sec for item x or mineral y or whatever it should help establish new trade routes and sources for supplier to meet buyer.the same would hold true for bad sec status players looking for only low sec or null sec sources for what they are looking for.anyway, that's my proposal...."
12/14/2008,"this idea sounds good and could possibly spread the players out more, if thats the case i'd be happy to see it come to fruition and finally see jita lag free to pass through when needed"
12/14/2008,"sounds like a viable idea, definitely can save time in searching for best buy or best sell for not having to travel to each region."
12/14/2008,"i understand the rationale, but i'm pretty sure having one would market would break the market database. we can already split by sec status(look at market settings), but merging markets is almost certainly not going to happen for technical reasons. you can try if you'd like, but i'm pretty sure that they'd have done this already if they thought it'd work."
12/14/2008,its funny cause i thought assault frigates were designed to be uber level 1 mission runners cause they sure as **** dont have a point in pvp.
12/14/2008,you are either writing pure irony or you are plain stupid.
12/14/2008,oh you must be from a month ago. welcome to quantum rise where afs actually have a purpose in pvp. they make awesome anti-support and tacklers.
12/14/2008,"here is a very simple question to ask ccp:- when was the bug introduced?the answer to that question will tell us a lot already about the scope of the exploitation and it shouldn't reveal any information about the exploit itself or the about the identity of the cheaters. regards,m.m.ps. notice that ccp in their official statement hasn't addressed this crucial issue yet. they have said somebody petitioned a few days ago, but the availability/presence of the exploit/bug is not mentioned. people therefore get the impression this exploit is just a few days old. however if they didn't know about the bug then it was propably there from the beginning."
12/14/2008,"did ccp go back a month or so ago and check the pos's, to make sure they caught most of the exploiters? there are lots of rumors that someone was tipped off.will ccp take back the capitals and supercapitals built with these iskies? the amounts are so large, we know where the money went."
12/14/2008,hes pretty much asked my questions :d 4 years for ccp to figure it out is it me or does this indicate a. ccp do not care about exploits that are petitioned unill its to late b. ccp just do not rad petitions untill 4 years later c. ccp are just stupid?
12/14/2008,"1) how far is it possible to carry out an audit/investigation into the banned characters' ledgers to try to determine what the isk obtained from selling the free materials, was used for?2) how far will such an audit/investigation actually be carried out?that is to say, if the isk was passed on to confederates of the characters who actually used the exploit, can/will that be traced, along with any stuff (including t2bpos, which i understand ccp take pains to keep track of?) that was purchased with it?"
12/14/2008,"all i wann no ishow does ccp think this will infulance the market atm it is steady and everyone is enjoying it the t2 mods/ships are at a nice price for sellers and buyers but the best named lasers are hell >_< anyway, after what they havedone with removing the exploit the market will either increase in price because a lack of mods/ships are built there for less people will buy stuff there for people will leave because everything is to expensive to keep going, or they will decrease because well no reason really but all depends on what ccp will do so which way do ccp think that the market will headin a increase which makes people leave or a decrease because well i dnt no :p ?"
12/14/2008,"tbh, this incident has created a short-term market instability with lots of speculation going on, but in the long term there isn't anything that can cause a lot of damage.i don't really think there is any reason for ccp to bail out the eve economy. it'll correct itself, especially now alchemy puts a ceiling on reaction prices.t2 prices may go up a bit (most likely in the 10-20% range), but that is not actually a bad thing. i would in fact welcome higher t2 prices. not because i produce them or their components, but because it'll mean:a. more t1 named items will be used (ie. more variety)b. more tears when people lose t2 ships/stuffc. more satisfaction in killing t2 shipsd. more pride in flying t2e. more profit for pirates (i'm not one btw.)in short, higher t2 prices will insert more variety and emotions into eve, both of which are to the benefit of the game.so the sensible thing to do is to give the eve market a few months to find a new equilibrium, and then decide whether there is any need for intervention. doing so now would be based on panic, not on facts (as nobody know exactly what will happen)."
12/14/2008,"indeed it well. i also would like to note that over the period of time of this argument that has commenced as it is inevitable to prevent from this strange situation in a social group. ccp hurts no one they never intend too. i'm not hurt, what does that tell you? your only hurting your self over this ridiculous argument over ccps decision and less we not forget who is the final judge if not the jury made in their attempts to making eve a better world. :) there's and ours alike we share like carebears :p this must be a case where player empowerment takes over there heads. lol silly players"
12/14/2008,"aside from the current questions posted about the duration, knock-on effects and why it was never spotted (if you work out the maximum amount of moon mineral that can be mined and then search the markets for how much was sold; in addition to the amount that would be used for t2 it would surely give you an indication that something was up?) - then what i'd very much like ccp to make public is:1) how can we be sure the duration you inform the playerbase or the csm is correct?2) how can we be sure you have actually perma-banned 70 accounts? i would never expect personal details, despite the fact it's against the eula, however the characters themselves belong to ccp. therefore you can publish the character names of those that were banned, the corp/alliance names belong to you too - you can publish those also.when people then do not see character x appear in the game again we will know something has probably been actually been done to the extent that you have publicised. saying that, i'm sure ccp will only tell the csm what they want them to know, it's not like they can storm the ccp offices and confiscate equipment and look at logs etc.i'm sure this is only going to have occured in a matter of a few days, and only 100 or so characters will have been using it, nothing to see here, the game you've been playing for 5 years has not really been totally skewed for the past 4 - the markets that we pride our game on is unaffected, as is the political landscape. seriously, 'eve: the movie' would be nothing compared to 'ccp: the movie.'just a shame that jim henson isn't alive to direct it."
12/14/2008,1 i would like for ccp to give me all the items they confiscated.
12/14/2008,"name and shame would be best, of at least the corp names(alliances they were in too after all we can look them up if we have the corp names).while most people will realise that it will take a bit of time to get all the info etc there are good reasons why people want to know everything about this incident. things like how long has this exploit been around?(this is a cruicial question im sure ccp are really looking into) if it is indeed the 4 years or so that has been stated by some people(with no evidence) then the whole landscape of eve would have been different. while people have allready started speculating to what will happen with regards to t2 supply and demand, how much less will there really be? how much did the exploited materials really make up of the whole supply?"
12/14/2008,"there are 2 main questions i would like to know:1) are ccp satisfied with the way quantum rise speed nerf has influenced pvp dynamics within the game? if not, then what parts are they not happy with.2) ccp has mentioned multiple times that they are not satisfied with the current pos and sovereignty system and that they will try to revise it. my question is: are they satisfied with the way jump bridges have effected the dynamics of 0.0 pvp? if not, what do they think should be done with jump bridges?i'd imagine that many old school pvpers would like to know answers to these questions."

12/14/2008,"evemail needs a lot more than that to be functional, sadly. this would be one of many changes, not the only one. but yes, we desperately need an evemail overhaul. i'd be happy with outlook express 1.0(since it'd be a leap forward by about 10 years), but if you want to push for gmail, i can get behind that. just make it so that i can stop describing the mail, igb, and forum software as ""paleolithic"", and i'll be happy, really."
12/14/2008,ccp is already reworking the evemail client. it's a part of the cosmos project. you can find that in the minutes from the first ccp-csm meeting.
12/14/2008,"i'd be happy with a training list of only 1+1. being able to set just one additional skill would really make things easier, yet not more powerful. i really hate babysitting my pc just because level 1 or 2 only takes a few minutes, yet the next level takes the time i'll be afk."
12/14/2008,"first of all, it's best to quote the post your responding to above your post, to make it easier for people to follow you.unless the queue has a limit to it to prevent this. say, not allowing you to add new skills to the queue once you have 2 weeks of skills queued up.what exactly is wrong with it ?if your going to point to farming characters to sale i'll need you to provide two things:1 - an estimate of how much isk they can get compared to how much cash they spent creating the character.2 - a reason as to why they can't farm the characters now by logging in for skill changes.after all, they paid the full price for their account, but they used it less. which makes them more profitable to ccp than the rest of us. meaning more spare money to spend on server upgrades.a maximum size to the buffer is to be expected. but why not allow a week or so for if something more serious happens ?like the player getting hospitalised. what about a player who lets a skill expire on a non-implant clone, spends some time pvping until the buffer is nearing its maximum. then he clone jumps to a clone with a set of +5s and uses the backdating on those. so he gets the benefit of a set of +5s, without risking them being destroyed.one way to fix this issue is a significant reworking of the learning implants.a skill queue that only allows a single queued skill would also help you if you keep a long skill queued there. the main difference here is that a queue requires you to think about it in advance, backdating lets you think about it after the fact."
12/14/2008,"free faction ships would also be nice. like a free faction frigate every month, a free faction cruiser every two months and a free faction battleship each for midsummer and midwinter.of course that would ruin the value of faction ships. so make it possible to magically transmute the ships into blue dwarfs that can in turn be traded in for scablings. each scabling would be worth 200 skillpoints, but you could not use it yourself. you could only give them to rat npcs in belts. only in 0.7 systems, though. once you have trained up a rat to 500.000 sp, you can hire him to blow up a single asteroid for you. that could easily handle macro mining, if enough people do it. the macro miners would then probably transmute all their faction ships into blue dwarfs... frell, that is a vicious circle."

12/14/2008,there is allready a flagship skill in the database and its been in there for years it currently requires wc 5.

12/14/2008,"passwords for ships would be great idea, alongside allowing the existing hacking skill and codebreaking module to break into ships. creates a new mini-profession while giving a tiny bit of security."
12/14/2008,"no,because there will be hundreds of ships out in high sec. frankly the -10.0 pirates ships that they leave in a safe spot for them to kamikazi in to a belt, i want to be able to scan them down and just pick up the damn ship in my battle badger. stick it in a pos or in the station or else we will have a whole new set of problems it's fine the way it is.plus ships don't have keys..."
12/14/2008,you're not supposed to leave a ship in space...
12/14/2008,"i like this idea and as for the problem of having ships cluttering everywhere, make it so that you can attack a ""parked"" ship without being concorded or turning flashy. this way if you want to leave a ship at a safespot, you can but there is the risk of it being scanned down and blown up even in highsec."
12/14/2008,"i've been propagating for this a bit here and there...and yes, this would be a monumental step forward in the usability of eve, it would certainly be a bigger and more useful change than the premium graphics, or ambulation, or any other change that has occurred or is planned for eve. it is a simple fact that an un-customizable ui is very poor form for a reasonably modern computer program, and once you start planning a customizable ui, the ""scripting"" approach is the logical conclusion.for ""real world"" applications, the reference to look at is definitely modo, a 3d modelling application, and for games, look no further than the enormous addon community for wow.there is simply no imaginable negative side-effect that could justify not implementing an open/scriptable ui system for eve.down with fake difficulty brought on by poor ui design!"

12/15/2008,"no.terrible idea.reasons have been given above (reputation, corp thieves, etc...).acceptable exception would be to allow a once only name change after trial period ends - so players who made up ad hoc names at start of trial can fix a stupid name and get rid of unwanted digits. at that time there is not much reputation to keep and nobody should have had any chance to steal with a 2 week old char.if you don't like the name of a char you are offered - don't buy it - it's just like any other attribute/skill you might dislike.besides - it's certainly not worth the code/db effort and potential bugs that might result from this."

12/15/2008,"it's pretty asinine to suggest that it takes skill to log in and start training the next 1-2 month long skill when the last one finishes. i'm quite able to change skills manually, but after having done it for a few years, i really don't see the necessity of it."
12/15/2008,i for the life of me can't understand the reasoning for not having one now that the skills stop training when you stop paying. allowing every paying customer to queue up as many skills as they want puts everyone on equal footing as skill training goes.

12/15/2008,"i don't pirate anymore, but i am all down for this. lowsec as a whole needs some love. this is a great start.also, i rather liked the idea of making 0.1 sec space the pirate playground. but let's expand that. allow bubbles/bombs/hics to work in 0.1 sec, however leave the sentries. this way hics will be viable, but will have to earn it. and bubble camps can intercept alliance/0.0 low-end logistics (because they all use carriers/jfs really).also slightly increase lowsec bounties across the board, rp reasoning: ""due to their close proximity to empire sovereign space, we are offering a bonus on pirate ships in the systems that are not viable for our navy's fleets to patrol."""
12/15/2008,thing is... low sec isnt low sec. it's basically 0.0 with a few limitations.why 0.4 had charters cost is confusing... but having limitations on 0.4 like moonmining is alright i guess. there are a ton of 0.4 systems which are out of the way that nobody ever goes to.0.3 generally means there's attention there from pirates and pirates can get there.there are 0.4 systems which are all by themselves; pirates have to go through high sec to get there. leaving them at quite a disadvantage. that's why u have the limits.
12/15/2008,"though i dont need a ""name and shame"" and i do understand ccps ""we dont discuss exploits"" policy a detailed report on what happened and how it affected eve and especially with our economist on board, this is a good time to regain trust from the community and would be very welcome."
12/15/2008,"looks like i missed the meeting, will there be minutes posted...(or cliff-notes)?"
12/15/2008,can we get some updates please?
12/15/2008,"yes, update is ""we dont give a f.u.c.k about our customers and we will not even reply here, ever""now go to sleep"
12/15/2008,"solomon, updates will be available in the meeting minutes, which should be posted soon. i cannot go into detail beyond that."
12/15/2008,thats what i am referring to. i am waiting for a new meeting minutes post.
12/15/2008,wth did or didn't they know?
12/15/2008,signed
12/15/2008,"guys,we spent 4 hours in meeting yesterday on a sunday. the minutes has to be read trough by ccp to make sure no important information was left out and then later posted as a news item. they will be out today, but please be patient. we are all waiting eagerly, but there's not long to go."
12/15/2008,"agreed there must be absolute transparency. there have been too many issues in the past:- t2 bpo seeding favouritism- corrupt ccp staff giving extra support to their corps and alliances- boot.ini bug, an example of very poor quality control and very poor programming skills- the gtc marketing waffle about the 60 day cards - to align with other mmos when we all knew it was about hiking priceslets be honest eve is a great concept being run by a company ccp with very poor management, quality control,development and customer relations skills."
12/15/2008,"further comment:if any csm member is in a corp or alliance that benefited from this exploit then they must stand down and elections held from people with a clean and untainted record. it is inconceivable that you could be a prominent member of a corp or alliance, well known enough to get csm elected and not know that your corp/alliance was using this exploit."
12/15/2008,"i can assure you that none on the csm is at all connected to this exploit. i can't cover how i know this due to nda however, but rest assured that nobody ever used it. if they did, they would have been banned."
12/15/2008,"unfortunatlly we are going to listen this a lot, so i'm not very convinced about all this pr thingy about 'transparency'.ccp using the csm to say ""hey, don't trust us if you want but at least trust this guys in the csm, they're players after all, like you are!; even if they can't disclose information because they have signed this nda"".trust should be based on facts, not on faith."
12/15/2008,"fwiw, supported.but this is just too big to not be drowned under a sea of ndas. little hope here.ah well."
12/15/2008,"good day! i do not have a set opinion or conclusion at this time due to the lack of complete information. in other words..i don't know. what i do know is that during the course of any investigation...whether it be in law enforcement, military, or business (and eve does have it's corporations, yes?)it is prudent not to make too much information public while the investigation is being conducted. i'm sure, with a little research (i encourage you to find out for yourself), you will find there are some rather good reasons for this. it's similar to insisting jurors be uninformed in advanced before going over evidence etc and deciding a case as information that is incomplete or taken out of context could affect their final conclusion and decision. such conclusions and decisions all to often end up not being the best one (depending on point of view, of course). all this means is if they are currently conducting the investigation to get a more complete picture and are honest and earnest about correcting any possible issues that may arise out of their investigations, then i will just content myself with impatiently waiting for a official final conclusion. right now, any conclusion i may draw on this matter would be opinion. i'm waiting for the complete official facts just because i wont feel quite as stupid if i guessed and ended up wrong, lol."
12/15/2008,"minutes just got greenlighted, so expect them up in the next hour or two!"
12/15/2008,update?
12/15/2008,greenlighted by ccp = censured all relevant information to the player community ?
12/15/2008,don't expect anything else.
12/15/2008,"we have waitedm its been about 2 hours, w t f is going on to delay this? what are they hideing?"
12/15/2008,sad thing about this matter is that there is no checks or balances its only when someone rats on someone that you ever see anything ever done. of all things you would think that people would of noticed more complex of a product otu there than could be ever produced. still everyone will pay to play a game even though the people in charge of keeping it fair and balance never do a good job. its just hey lets not fix it and use it or turn the other cheek for certain members of ccp and with more bad media coming out this game will never become great. it will just be something that could of been because individuals who can do things never have to worry about being check of wrong doing until its way beyond the point of damage. so tell me how does someone who makes insane amounts of isk go for 4 years without ever being crossed check? or the countless others that do it. sad part about it is such a great game but yet such poor management of ones employees
12/15/2008,you have only waited for 1 hour
12/15/2008,"why even edit it? we deserve the entire, raw, text. anything else is just helpng a cover-up."
12/15/2008,"yeah! it's not like this is a game or anything, and ccp has privacy policies! witch hunt time!you 'deserve'?"
12/15/2008,where are they posting ???here or another thread
12/15/2008,"let me start out by saying that the exploit has been going on for less than a year. it wasn't even possible to do the exploit a mere two years ago, so that 4 year thing is rediculous.second, while the people did make a great deal of isk, it wasn't an insane amount, and all those possessions are probably being siezed as we speak. the amount they made was less than the amount that exchanges hands in a single day in eve, so while it may be noticeable, it's not significant or game-breaking.last, there will probably be a price spike on ferrogel, but it will balance out due to alchemy. the price might never be as low as it is now, but it will not spike through the roof either. if eyjog notices the price getting extreme, i trust that he'll take steps to equalize it."
12/15/2008,"hehe funny that csm started talking like ccp after they got elected, not talking about you only but every one else too, we deserve transparency not hush hush cover up, and people were saying from the word go that csm is a way to silence our voices i didn't believed them but now thinking about it being true."
12/15/2008,"i thought a csm member had confirmed already it had been going on for two years? i read it, not sure if it's further up in this thread or was during the chat session yesterday?"
12/15/2008,"and why did ccp say then ""working with the research & statistics team we have established that the effects on the markets have been considerable and far reaching."" (original post)funny, funny, aint it?"
12/15/2008,"bunyip, with all due respect, i really dont trust you becouse you are talking like a marketing guy and acting like a ccp shrill.have some orbs, be for the people who you are sopposed to represent."
12/15/2008,"don't get me wrong, the prices will spike and we'll have a bit of tumult on the markets, but a lot of people are exploding this far more than it deserves. this was a disaster that slipped through qa's hands, and i'm not trying to justify them or their actions. sometimes, though, mistakes will happen, and then it goes down to ccp being on cleanup crew (as they are right now).ferrogel will probably never return to the price it is now, but if it gets too high, ccp will take action to normalize it to ensure the game doesn't shatter. the meeting minutes will explain all of this, but for now, all i can tell you is a taste of what was said in the meeting.the exploit was available to be used for less than two years, and wasn't discovered by the exploiters until less than a year ago. fyi, about two years ago (as noted above) a patch was released that didn't affect poses, but a line of code or something came in conflict, creating the exploit. that has been patched now, and ccp is working to make sure something like this never happens again.if you could feel the tension in the meeting room, you'd understand how much ccp wants this resolved, and they're going to be going through their records for some time now making sure every possible exception is taken care of. if there were alliances that used this exploit to their advantage and knew it was occuring, i sense there will be a sudden power vacuum in 0.0."
12/15/2008,well where are the meeting minute notes? we've been told 1-2 hours and we're far past that i believe.
12/15/2008,"they are removing the ""names"" that cannot be implicated in this."
12/15/2008,this is just one giant conspiracy and cover-up.
12/15/2008,"here little man, have more tinfoil."
12/15/2008,you came to tash-murkon and asked for my vote. you promised to represent the players. why are you quoting ccp montra? this has been going on longer than you state in this missive. other personnel have admitted to it.too bad you invested so very much time with us! ccp and you do not have the same writing style. someone other than you is penning these short inserts of misinformation. why are you permitting it? they cheated. they got caught. they allowed others to benefit from it. the market and every other aspect of this game has been impacted. this is neither trivial nor incidental. why are you attempting to pretend it is so?when are the individual responsible going to be named?when are we going to know the alliances involved?when are we going to be told the names of the corporations involved?when are you going to respond to us with honesty instead of the company coined utterance? if you are nothing more than their guise - why do it? did you lie to me when i asked if you would be this and you said no? obviously you did! you are a liar!
12/15/2008,thanks! i didn't have enough already.
12/15/2008,"remember that the game didn't 'shatter' when t2 prices were set by the bpo holders... it's not going to happen either even if t2 prices were to increase drastically...there is plenty of reason to think that t2 as it is is actually too cheap. the main one being that it has completely made almost all named t1 items unused. if t2 prices got a kick upwards, you'd suddenly see a lot more of the available items actually being used."
12/15/2008,"very true tech ii is too cheap atm.lets see the meeting details, and then decide if ccp is covering its arse"
12/15/2008,"all i can say is we are getting the first results of the ccp investigation into the exploit. ccp is in no way finished with the investigation. my impression is that ccp takes this very seriously. you've heard some statements about the meeting and the realities of the exploit from the csm. i'm only going to say i don't think ccp is far enough into their investigation to make definite statements about the scope of the exploit. there will be more definite releases from ccp when more is known.i also share frustrations in regards to naming and shaming, but i also understand the ccp policies and respect their decision to not name involved parties. please know these policies are not about covering things up, they are about concerns for individual rights to privacy.i hope the pilots of eve continue to demand transparency from both the csm and ccp. you all need to decide for yourselves what that means but if something is not explained to your satisfaction you need to continue to make any dissatisfaction known.issler"
12/15/2008,so where are the meeting minutes?
12/15/2008,"i'm not one of the peasants with pitchforks and torches, but i am avid to see those minutes. ""an hour or two"" has turned into three and a half plus, any idea when they'll actually go up?"
12/15/2008,"unfortunately i guess, being heavily edited for ""content"".such a shame, i had high hopes for the csm.well at least i might be able to see who asked what questions, provided those haven't also been edited."
12/15/2008,so when do we get that report?! we have been waiting...
12/15/2008,"as far as i'm aware, characters/ingame corporations are not classed as entities with regard to privacy rules, and it would go some way to showing actions rather than simply talking about them.you have to admit that ccp's credibility to it's playerbase is taking a hell of a hit and the csm was created as an answer to the concept of 'transparency'. at this juncture it would be interesting and possibly a pr coup to simply tell us numbers of the banned and dissolved corps rather than hide behind such vague concepts as 'far reaching' and 'many'."
12/15/2008,"right to privacy for what? if they knowingly exploited the game they lost their right to privacy.mark my words if they do not release names this will just fuel the rampant speculation about who exactly was involved and it will only further diminish any trust the player base has in ccp with regards to devs being in alliances and so forth.there comes a time when you have to come clean and this is it.unless, of course, you discovered half your dev team is involved in this.....right?"
12/15/2008,"just as soon as ccp's ministry of information, pr and marketing departments can apply enough polished truth-speak<U+FFFD> to the meeting minutes. be prepared to hear all about how alchemy is going to be double plus good!"
12/15/2008,"in the real world of grownups, that is not how it works. as a business entity ccp has certain obligations and responsibilities. they are obligated to follow their own terms of service and privacy policy, lest someone sue them. they are under no obligation to cooperate with a lynching party on their forums.the nerdragers here talk a whole lot about 'respect' and 'trust' of the playerbase (nice of you to speak for all of us). i would have considerably less trust and respect for ccp if they revealed private information, or decided to point their fingers at people.if you don't believe they're telling the truth about any facet of this, why, therefor, do you have such implicit trust in their naming of names? anyone they referred to would certainly be banned, and would have absolutely no way to respond to it."
12/15/2008,well i can't wait for the meeting minutes all day - i have other stuff to do. this whole fiasco is just pure bs. *an hour or two?* my ass.
12/15/2008,the level of disclosure about this exploit by ccp. will either validate the csm. or prove its irrelevance.
12/15/2008,"you'll find that everything they supply is their property, meaning the data.yeah, it eventually translates into the commercial reality of people jumping ship once there is a competing product on the market.oh, you silly bear, a character name isn't private information. i can see hundreds in local on a daily basis. as for pointing fingers, a ban is pretty pointy."
12/15/2008,they should name and shame.
12/15/2008,it was always a political body and they're restricted by ndas...so meh.
12/15/2008,"there seems to be many people who have wrong understanding of what people are demanding here. we aren't asking for the real world names of the people involved. the privacy of real life person behind the game character will not be put at risk.what people want here are names of the banned characters, which doesn't violate any privacy rules."
12/15/2008,and the name of every corperation and alliance doing it.
12/15/2008,"so i am frustrated as well, i pushed back on the privacy concerns and asked for character names to be released but ccp is firm about their policies. i expect this to be discussed in iceland next month. the csm is going to get to see the ""scrubbed"" logs and we will make sure that the logs accurately represent the meeting. i don't think it is unreasonable to take a day or so to get some logs reviewed and posted. its not like a few hours changes anything. so some patience please! everyone involved in the meeting sunday wants you all to see these logs.issler"
12/15/2008,"no, they want us to see the version of the logs that make them look better. if they wanted us to see these logs, we would be already."
12/15/2008,"disclosure of exploits, reasoning behind the gm activity.incidentally, it should be not discussing gm activity...and this appears to have something to do with this exploit not being caught a lot earlier, if you've been following events. the thing is that there have been problems with recruiting gms from 0.0 alliances for a very long time, and this is closely connected with other 'privileged' accounts having access to information and items over the past few years that have been misused to provide ingame advantage, not to mention a fairly dirty little backtrade in isk.while some people are willing to stick their fingers in their ears and do an officer barbrady impersonation on the forums, quite frankly i'm bored of being told that they're handling things. i'd like to actually see the results of investigations, or something slightly more concrete than 'we did something about it' only for the relevant issues to crop up again.i've spoken about auditing before now in relation to isk trading. they could be doing something about it, but we don't know. we saw what happened with t20, but we don't know how they're going to avoid it happening in the future. we've seen shenanigans with ships being moved during fleet fights, but we don't know what happened.the people who're asking for accountability are after a bit of accountability; not a 'lynch mob' as you emoted...after all, it's difficult to lynch the non-existant."
12/15/2008,"while i can see why people want to know the names of both the corps and characters involved there are good reasons not to give them. such as it could and probably would have a profound influence on 0.0 sovernty. after all if you knew that any of the major alliances had just lost 70 or so accounts, that were responsible for managing the industry side of things, what would you do? press the issue, go to war and try and disrupt their industry even more, and efectivtly killing them. while it would be nice to get the names it more than likley wont happen because it would have a negitave effect on those who had no idea that this had been going on inside those corps and even alliances. people need to realise that so far from what ccp have stated it was only 70 accounts, so could be less than 35 people(if they had 2 accounts each) even less. the implications for those who are inocent is greater than the name and shame of a handful of people who have allready been delt with."
12/15/2008,the alliances involved in this deserve to have their sov stripped. how many super-capitals & outposts & pos's were funded by this exploit? how many wars were won because of it?
12/15/2008,exposure leading to large scale changes in sovereignty?where do i sign...if 'x' alliance has benefited from and been able to obtain sovereignty due to the exploit they should lose it. one way or another.the csm is truly just a toothless entity and just a sop to players if they cant actually influence ccp to release who was using the pos exploit.not disclosing names and alliances may well do more damage to ccp and simply fuel the rampant speculation that devs were involved
12/15/2008,because every single person in those alliances knew about it and was doing it....
12/15/2008,bolded the important part
12/15/2008,"the point is mute. what is the likelihood that the alliance didn't know? they received dirty isk to purchase x thing or win x ... they deserve to lose it, period."
12/15/2008,"the research is already being done and there's one alliance that's going to lose a bunch of sov shortly due to the mechanism of having a bunch of corps disbanded. losing accounts and corps has an effect on the reality of the game, it's not like a bunch of people aren't checking the alliance lists in the corp tab for disappearances."
12/15/2008,"privacy concerns about a character, wtf. i understand releasing the name of the player might have privacy issues. but the name of an artificial digital creation, this is bs. it smells, seems like they don't what anyone to trace the characters associations and activities."
12/15/2008,"lets cut the bs...ccp is removing anything that makes them or their ""friends"" look bad. the odds of us knowing who did what are slim to none. all this is going to do is add fuel to the already rampant rumor mongering fires that burn here. ccp could clear up so much of the past allegations against them with regards to t20 and bob and what not by naming the names of the characters/alliances involved. they could start to re-build that bridge of trust that got burnt down long ago. and the csm should be threatening to resign as a united body if ccp doesnt tell us who is responsible for this."
12/15/2008,"no, just the ones with the roles necessary to setup the pos', maintain them, ask the inevitable question 'how cumz we so rich?'. pilots without any culpability will move on, and the actual names will be listed elsewhere other than the official eve site."
12/15/2008,"if every sinlge alliance member knew then all the alliances and everyone else in game would have known too, due to spies etc. the people who found this exploit more than likley saw its potential, figured that if they kept it withing a small group that they could trust they could get away with it for months, and thats exactly what happened.the only reason why they were in an alliance in the 1st place was to get access to these moons so they could set it up. while it would be nice for ccp to name them, dont get me wrong i want to know too, i can see why they wont(even though it will be figured out eventualy). most alliances have 300 or so people, the big ones have thousands. 70 characters for the big alliances isnt that big a loss, they loose 3+ characters a day from people leaving corps(of course prob gain a few but shh).basicly by nameing the corps ccp give everyone permision to black list anyone from those corps and alliances, even though they more than likley had no idea what was going on or how said corp/alliance got so powerfull."
12/15/2008,an alliance that has benefitted on a large scale from the exploit shouldnt simply be disbanded and every member kicked into an npc corp?
12/15/2008,and may have already been
12/15/2008,source/link?
12/15/2008,christ you people are dumb
12/15/2008,i think the main point is there is an opportunity for ccp to take the word 'transparency' out of the hands of marketing and avoid looking dumb once we go and check out the wider convo in places on the internets where marketing have no pull.
12/15/2008,serious business.
12/15/2008,minutes are published
12/15/2008,"what i see so far is this: 1) select few have been abusing the system for a very long time. at least for 2 years. 2) somehow the ""free isk haxor"" leaked, was discovered by a number of others. 3 ccp promptly steps in and ""whacks things into place.""so, the deal is, what we see here with just ev0ke thus far implicated, and just some silly 70 characters banned, is a tip of an iceberg, the tendrils of the massive corruption that has taken over many - and i am not saying all - 0.0 alliances & power blocs. there is no way on earth, as some might want us to believe, this thing has been going on a ""wide-spread basis"" for a mere few months, or for even 6 months. the problem is systemic, and has been present, as i only conjectured from my experience in an ""official thread"", and now have been confirmed by csm, for at least 2 years. the only way i can interpret the ""wide-spread"" of ccp is: ""we saw that everyone who is anyone, and their pet goldfish somehow found out about it, so we had to step in."" so, yes, a full disclosure is a must in this case, i am sure ev0ke are not the only ones in this mess."
12/15/2008,agree.
12/15/2008,"sad thing is, it would not be hard to add a few fields in the database to enable tracking of item ownership/creation/destruction. triggers in the sql dba would do most of the work."
12/15/2008,"since when does personal privacy extend to alliances. i cant beleive the csm just let that go either; characters i understand but corp/alliance? come on.we already know about evoke, and if ccp wants to stop speculation (as they're locking all the threads) maybe you should, oh i dunno, tell people who the other alliance is, if indeed it *was* only two."
12/15/2008,[snip] . . . the csm should be threatening to resign as a united body if ccp doesnt tell us who is responsible for this.csm members for the people or themselves?
12/15/2008,"best quote from the minutes, and may qualify as the understatement of the year. lol that we had to wait a week for these bunch of vague non-answers, but hey, that's the ccp way! i think the csm have proven themselves to be irrelevant, we would have likely received the very same ""answers"" without their involvement."
12/15/2008,"...but would we have gotten them as quickly without the csm?remeber the t20 incident took months to get any sort of ""answers""."
12/15/2008,"qft. lol, csm rolling over again and playing nice doggy with ccp."
12/15/2008,"we get ""answers"" quicker now because ccp can craft their spin with the csm as their soundingboard and then just point back at the csm (when the players rabble) and spout crap like ""transparency"". imho the csm is just another layer of damage control/insulation for ccp. it is so, so, truly sad the csm's purpose and responsibilities aren't what was originally promised by ccp's ceo after the t20 incident."
12/15/2008,i couldn't agree more with you.
12/15/2008,"i think this is apt, considering that csm is just a joke when it comes to its dealings with ccp, the first csm was a resounding failure with issues unresolved, and they all went nicely home."
12/15/2008,"alright, i just read the minutes ... what the **** was that, really?***talk about dancing around a bush, here. i waited a week for this? vague questions and even vaguer answers?"
12/15/2008,signed.
12/15/2008,wtf? there's a limit on war decs!? there should be no limit on lul production in eve.approved.
12/15/2008,"did i tell you about the time i ejected from my aeon to board a rifter when there were 20 strange and unknown people within 1km of me?because the top option switches from ""approach"" to ""board ship"" when ships are unmanned... and there's no confirmation box! there's a confirmation box on every other way to leave your ship except this one."
12/15/2008,i have a sneaky suspicion that something like this is all ready in the works.supported.
12/15/2008,"i like this, and hope it is posible."
12/15/2008,"not a bad idea. but instead of pooping out a pod at the moon/planet. make it an industrial thing.indy hauler/person transport (omg new shipclass! :p) brings in new item: colonists/prisoners/workers/whatever else times x amount needed to colonize (make it similar to charters for poses). the colonists are not used by the hour, instead they mine moon minerals by so much percent x number of people there.add in leaderships skills and social skills to affect work efficiency, etc etc. if you skills in that are low, the planet will be dissentful and give a penalty. also if the planet/moon does not get regular shipments of tradegoods needed, their efficiency also goes down. do the opposite, and they remain happy (they can never make more than a set amount of percent per colonist/whatever)also the type of people you bring will affect this number, ie. if you make a labor colony with prisoners, dissent will be high regardless of tradegoods and whatnot, unless your standings to that empire/faction is low. basically, give the prisoners some common ground with you and they'll support you. this would give pirates incentives to colonize.trade goods would come in for a return of moon minerals. this would allow ccp to remove moon mining from poses and give it to colonies. it would also allow multiple mining types, and the people would not mine just one mineral type. and the ""colonists"" could even randomly ""discover"" a vein of something harder to find in that region/rare in that region (dypro moons in my lowsec?) that would only last for a set amount, and then dry up. this would give more dynamic to the moon mining as a whole. it also prevents passive isk generation through taxes, as it still requires someone to pick up the goods. and gives traders and contact couriers more jobs.so to summarize and give a tl;dr version (sort of)> buy a hauler (or new passenger transport ship)> transport to moon where pos i (corp) own(s) exists> colonize> use hauler to deliver trade goods to keep colonists happy> miners mine> haul in more trade goods and people (mining's dangerous work, some will die!)> haul out moon mins> profit.and yes, i recommend this be locked to low sec for the time being, it will give lowsec something that 0.0 and highsec don't have, and it could prove almost as profitable as 0.0 moon mining (perhaps even the same if you hit that rare dypro vein, at least for a limited time). so it doesn't take away from 0.0 economics, but it does take away from highsec, which let's face it, is way to easy to make a bucket of isk in anyway.once lowsec is decently colonized (a percentage the player base could agree on (csms)), then 0.0 colonization could be opened. alternate idea: make it lowsec, but make the miners in colonies more efficient than moon miners modules at poses, so that it's more rp realistic. but that's only for story/immersion reasons. it wouldn't even have to actually affect operation i spose. i dunno about that./discuss."

12/15/2008,i support the idea of a revamp of the assets window.
12/15/2008,"i support a revamp, and this is a nice idea."
12/15/2008,i'm all for this.
12/15/2008,"what this last meeting proved is that the csm requests may be completely ignored by ccp even if they are supported by the vast majority of the community.the disclosure of the banned accounts and associated alliances was a strong and almost unanimous request from the community, as made obvious by the motion in this same page. even so ccp refused to comply, justifying with their policy to protect user privacy. well, the explanation is as absurd as the fact. it is a very different thing to announce player names and character names. announcing <edit>character</edit> names in no way violates user privacy, even because it is done all the time when such chars win prizes, for example. god, even player names are disclosed all the time, as in the csm ellection. so, in conclusion, ccp not only failed to comply with a request of 95% of its player base, it also invented lame excuses to justify it. so i ask, why even bother with the csm, if when the situation for which the csm was created comes they can do nothing about it and are just ignored. the csm members should just mass resign and deny this facade to ccp."
12/15/2008,"the forums only attracts about 10% of the total player base. less than 5% of the total player base even bothered to vote in the last csm. less than 0.05% of the total player base even voted in the thread here about the exploit.your numbers are wrong, and your emo nerd rage is strong. i might agree to a degree in the sentiment, that csm is pre-nerfed in their ability to deal with ccp, i do however strongly disagree with your logic and your solution."
12/15/2008,"you are incorrect. the op of that thread said nothing of the sort. it was a call for transparency on the subject. i supported the proposal on the grounds of transparency on the exploit, not for a pitchfork-waving crusade, and i can assume others did, too."
12/15/2008,"in any democratic process those who abstain are ignored. it is this way in the real world and it is as it should be in eve or anywhere else. you can't know the opnion of those that didn't give it to you, so you work with the opinions you have. so your argument is completely groundless. just read the posts, shall you? and then read the thread about the exploit. you will see that the most unanimous request even between those that disagreed about everything else was for full disclosure."
12/15/2008,agreed
12/15/2008,"they should - but would not - resign if: ccp investigation shows unwillingness to share all relevant information with the public. they should - but would not - resign if: ccp would use an nda to shut up the members of csm from telling the public the truth. if csm has integrity, they would force the ccp's hand into disclosure of the truth. however, as i have seen from last csm, they are hampered by nda - which incidentally puts their playing account into jeopardy, should they break it. and ccp is not shy about enforcing the nda on the csm - which makes csm effectively castrated. there you go.edit: if csm really had backbone, and something more than a wish for the name csm and a free trip to iceland, they would threaten ccp with unilateral resignation, and thus would cause a huge pr problem for ccp, since their globally touted independent player commission would quit due to ccp's own intransigence. i still hold hope that there is a couple of csm who can pull it off, and just by the fact of resignation alone would cause a significant uproar on the forums and then in greater player community. they would not have to reveal what ccp does not want revealed, but simple statement like: i [we] can not, in good conscience, remain a member[s] of the body that is strictly for show. i [we] can not, in good conscience, be part of the system where csm members are threatened, or reminded of the nda, and thus brought into line, when greater good of the public, for whom csm was created, and whom we supposed to represent, calls for answers that we are not allowed to give. i guarantee you a 100% uproar on that one. too bad none of them will ever do it."
12/15/2008,hi a little while ago during the ghost training nerf a dev mentioned one of the reasons for the nerf was to bring them into line with other mmo's who don't give you anything for not having a sub.so in the spirit of bringing us into line with other mmo's i got to ask why do we pay one of if not the highest subs to be able to use just 1 char i would like to see us being able to train skills on all 3 slots.we could still only log in 1 acct at a time but being able to setup different skill plans on each char would be nice.i know this is never going to happen as ccp like the extra funds being forced to train only 1 char a time get's them but i had to ask.
12/15/2008,"**** ye, nicking my ghost training just as i was about to train bs lv5."
12/15/2008,"so, tell me, in what other mmo exactly can you advance three chars at the same time?and if you know it won't ever happen (for good reasons) why even post about it?"

12/15/2008,"i support all but the medical bay would need some tweaking, like you can spawn there but you can't update your clone. or use it like a clone vat bay"
12/15/2008,"edit: spacingi agree, poss need some lovin.definately agree with allowing containers and repackaging at corp hanger arrays.kinda meh on the anchoring queue. it always seemed to me that having someone to supervise was the point, even though you don't need to remain there after starting the process.i like the unanchoring idea, though my favorite suggestion is chribba's: make a skill that works like salvaging that can be used on offline poss.the t2 moon mining array sounds like a good idea, but i don't know how to make it work well. if it can mine double from even an abundance 1 resource sounds broken to me, and all other mining truncates fractions so it couldn't just output 2 units every 5 hours or something.i would like to see a medical bay, but as stated in this thread that would seriously impact on one of the important functions of outposts. though i guess that allowing repackaging does too somewhat.but overall, poss need attention, and this looks like a good start to me."
12/15/2008,"well, gameworld validation is an interesting concept. i'd support it being looked at, but have no idea how feasible such a thing is. i know databases i've messed around with defining 'database wide' validation of the kind you seem to be suggesting is expensive on system resources, and prone to being not properly maintained. *shrug*. i think it'd be nice to be looked at as a possibility and thus i support it. i don't actually expect it to turn out as particularly feasible though.the logical other places where you could apply such validation is mineral creation. given respawn rates of asteroids, there's only so much veldspar that can be extracted in a given day. or for that matter npc average module drop rate vs. npc destruction/respawn rate (e.g. like in the bugged complexes whenever it was). on average only so many dread guristas invulnerability fields should show up each month. but the problem is, as ever, bugs aren't introduced deliberately. so there'd no guarantee that however a bug is introduced wouldn't automatically roll over to the validation system."
12/15/2008,would have thought this would have already been being done...

12/15/2008,better checks and balances.indeed.
12/15/2008,"no.terrible idea.not really as you obviously don't understand it.hi fellow traveller.come back from the dark side.instead of messing up the one true mmo that has a working single universe (yeah - i know - serenity - don't really count - isolated) you should examine you feelings and fix those. while both events make a number of people (on the forum) crazy - neither really affects most players that much at the end of the day.please don't use ""we"". i for one don't agree with you.i do trust them.i want them to play the game - how else are they supposed to understand what's going on? besides - eve would never have become this great game if the devs didn't work on a game that they want to play themselves. the last thing eve needs is a company like soe that makes it purely it's cash cow and has no personal interest.good idea. nothing to do with shards.and when after 1-2 years 0.0 is build up and claimed pretty much like now you want to start tq3?you are confused. nothing to do with a tq2.silly.again - that's silly. we already have seen bs. new cluster won't change that. if you can forget that easily just be happy and surprised again every time you jump into a new system and see you first ever bs - again. ;-)much easier and quicker fix: reset your perceptions and align them better to reality. if you think about it and take out all the hyperbole and tinfoil you might realize that the reasons you want to start anew are actually not a big problem.yeah, granted, while the t2 lottery was fair insofar as everybody had a chance to win - only a few did and they then had a money printing machine.but invention already fixed that.t20 - very annoying incident - but also a prime example of people blowing things out of all proportions. most eve players were never affected by that in any meaningful way.and bob isn't successful because t20 conjured up a few bpos. if riches were enough ascn (richest and biggest alliance of its time and builder of the first titan) would have conquered eve instead of being a closed chapter of eve history.pos exploit. first we'll have to await a final report. before then we mostly have speculation and rumors. but even if worst case assumptions were true - shrug - some prices will adjust. big deal. same happens every time new tech is introduced, or big patch introduces/changes ships or new features. again - most players will find that this does not actually affect them much.any claims that ccp in general is cheating at its own game - or helping bob/whoever - or ignoring exploits on purpose is unreasonable (not in their own best interests - best indicator of motivation i know). only makes me want to get tinfoil bpo to make some money out of this sillyness.none of the events you mentioned ever kept me from enjoying eve in over 5 years."
12/15/2008,"no!the main part of eve is large player interaction, something that doesn't happen much in multiple shards."
12/15/2008,"you'd think the sharders would take a hint when the old threads die horrible deaths.it""s a bad idea.have a cry about all the isk someone got instead of you then go blow up their shipjeez. i should write a response and save it as a word doc so i can copy and paste each time someone needs a clue."
12/15/2008,no!sharded eve = crap.what`s next - instancing?next? grinding for sp (ohh it was suggested lol)next? legendary helmet of newb pwnage?what about fishing?
12/15/2008,"there's a reason you don't have bill gates' bank account... your ideas are terrible. in eve your free to do as you please pretty much which means most of the time your going to try and give yourself an unfair advantage. while doing things outside of legal game mechanics is a bad thing, it gives you no more of an advantage the fighting with twice the numbers of your opponents, which i should point out will still happen on your new shard quickly making it ""unfair"" to corps with larger numbers."
12/15/2008,short answer: no.long answer: noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...my argument: that would kill the uniqueness of the game.
12/15/2008,"no.1. it would split the number of players.2. it would just repeat half known problems with a slight time delay.3. it would double server requirements, thus reducing overall server quality.4. it would flush player achievements, be it ships, be it isk, be it skillpoints, down the drain of indiscriminating and unreasonable 'fairness 4 all'.5. it would remove one of eve's most important and most unique features: one galaxy.6. it would eradicate what history eve has accumulated.7. it would endlessly confuse new players.8. there would be no veldnaught.9. i would have to grind level 1 missions in a noobship again and wait for days before i could fly anything decent. i will never ever do that again.10. half my ingame friends would be on one shard and half of them on another.last but not least, shards are by definition something bad. last time i looked at my favorite vase, it did not occur to me that it might be neat to have shards of it on the floor."
12/15/2008,"no.and yes, i don't trust gm players."
12/15/2008,that doesn't give ccp access to a market of 1 billion people. china's server does.
12/15/2008,hell no
12/15/2008,bad idea. lame. make it go away.if you want to go in another direction - just start training relevant skills.but don't make this fine game into guild wars (where you can re-allocate skills between quests - kills all immersion and sense of character).

12/15/2008,"i'd rather be reading original chat-log files with ccp just blanking out/removing information where they see required and have thoose lines market with something like *information removed*.while the minutes do indeed provide a quick way of reading through what was discussed, i dont like the fact they are being paraphrased by ccp and thoose lines (either paraphrased or removed) are not indicated.i dont see any reason for ccp why they wouldnt want to share the original log files with sensitive information being removed, except maybe the added workload to edit those logs / remove information from them.this proposal is not particulary based on mistrust towards ccp, but from my experience paraphrasing often turns to misleading information or information being differently perceived."

12/15/2008,"i would like to amplyfy that this proposal is not about the relation between ccp and the csm, or wether the csm is a pr intrument for ccp. the whole purpose of the proposal is for the playerbase to get more transparant and accurate information from ccp<>csm communications."
12/15/2008,"although, i would like to have the edited chat logs as well, in all likely hood this won't happen.furnishing edited chat logs would, at best, provide unending fodder for speculation. at worst, it would give a studious reader an idea of what ccp doesn't want people to know about.supported."

12/15/2008,we all know of the 4 new faction cruisers.exequror navy issue for example. the vanilla exequror has 600m3 cargo space and a cargo bonus. including the remote armor repair bonuses.there is 4 high slots and 4 turrets.i propose a redesign. drop the entire idea of these cruisers being used in combat... as they arent. might just be me... but i cant find a single killmail of one of these dieing. which is odd because i can find lots of caracal navy issue killmails.exequror navy issue for example... make it a vanilla exequror with 8 high slots and a tractor bonus.now carebears salvaging get their toy. all 4 of the races get similiarly changed.but it isnt just for carebears.currently a vanilla exequror would use 4 medium remote reps pretty much.you retain this... but you get a number more high slots to fit tractor beams. what do you do with those? you tractor wrecks; loot and salvage. cleans up the battlefield and earns you isk while you are remote repping your gang... incase the battle fails and you have to ditch. this way you recover some losses.it's good. win for pvp and win for pve with these changes.
12/15/2008,supported and i lied. i went through all cruiser kills on goonswarm's killboard and did find 1nubcake died in 0.0i dont think u can search any other boards as easily.i challenge someone else to bring up lots of other kills... i bet there's 10 capital ships killed per every one of these navy cruisers.
12/15/2008,"if this will stop carebears defacing the hurricane by turning it into a dedicated salvager, breaks my heart seeing a cane in such a state. then sure give them some overpriced toy to waste their isk on."
12/15/2008,"they are navy variants, redesigned for combat purposes, using a cheaper hull. they have not much in common with the normal t1 version. and they are definitely not intended for use in a peaceful, civilian manner.i rather have certain transportation/production oriented corporations (or the few factions like that) get the more peaceful ship variants into their lp stores.the exequror navy issue makes quite the fabulous glass cannon. now if it wasn't so much more expensive than a simple thorax it'd probably get used more often."
12/15/2008,"the only effect you get from making something easier is that more people will do it, thus diluting the profits from what is done.the only thing a dedicated loot/salvage ship will do is ensure that more people will loot and salvage, meaning more loot and salvage components on the market, with falling prices as the main result.most people think ""if i could just do this faster, i'd earn more isk"", but that is faulty reasoning since it'll be easier for everyone...the easier you make things in a game, the less challenging it becomes too....not a good idea...."
12/15/2008,this week for the third time since the start of fw the main killboard used by the caldari militia went inactive because whoever was paying apparently left militia/eve?could ccp host/pay for permanent fw milita killboards?most players in caldari milita are now reverting to using the general battleclinic killboard but the griefwatch or eve-dev based killboards are a lot nicer.
12/15/2008,"gallente killboard has gone down once and has since moved to one hosted by someone else. the current board is still rejecting named warp scramblers because it hasn't been updated with the new names.the only problem i can see with a ccp hosted on is that there is no-one who can moderate fake kill mails. but ccp does have access to the real data, so they could code it to automatically reject any fake kms.i am not requesting that people are forced to post to it. peer pressure works well enough for kills, and sharing the board with our opponents would mean losses get posted as well.so i'd request that this kb has two features available:1 - automatic rejection of any fake killmails.2 - a way for anyone to enter their full api key for automatic kill mail posting."
12/15/2008,"yeah, the game inbalance started with illegal isk selling, then legal isk selling (gtc)...and now this pos exploit thing. the fairness / balance is gone forever, and impossible to recover.i wouldn't hesitate a second to move to a new server if possible."
12/15/2008,"whats going to prevent the existing 0.0 power block allainces or new large alliances from moving in and establishing themselves in the 0.0 space in the new server? numbers and organization will play bigger part in determining how long a alliance keeps its foothold, much more than cheating ever will in the long run.... fairness and ballance never existed in eve, as every facet of the game revolves around player or groups of players trying to gain an advantage over others (e.g. blobing). some choose to take it to a bigger extreme than others. mind you its human nature to seek greater advantages over rivals. within a month or two the new server would be no different than tq as we know it now.. and ccp would have double the expenses for buying and maintaining another server(farm?)i don't get how adding another server will change anything or make eve more ""fair"". nor why people are so bothered about eve having to be fair when it has been designed not to be fair, i often have to play or operate at a disadvantage, but i don't go running to the forums and waste bandwith whining about it.so please, enthrall me with your acumen regarding why a new server would change anything. or perhaps about why eve has to be ""fair""?"
12/15/2008,nah... market will bounce back... and those who are legit now and have been able to legitimately create isk to wage war against exploit generated alliances. those alliances/corps are severely damaged and will be crushed.plus... evoke isnt even a 0.0 alliance afaik. it doesnt have sovereignty. i honestly dont really know who evoke is... their big isk couldnt have been that crazy.
12/15/2008,i'm confident more exploits exist that the majority are not even aware of.to assume creating a new server as exploit free.even with the changes you suggest will not provide an exploit free world.
12/15/2008,i disagree with what you saying.even the new server will have these issues in the future.you're dead wrong if you assume that they will not.
12/15/2008,"no.whatever 'imbalance' currently exists will be bled out of the economy over the course of the next few months. for starters, price corrections are already underway as people speculate on the market, or horde the cheap stuff now for future use.in the long term, this will straighten itself out, so there's no need for a restart of any kind."

12/15/2008,"1. watchlist: i'm not sure if that would like this. looks like it would remove an element of skill and not particularly fix anything.2. leading positions having different colored gang text: fleet commanders are seldom at the fleet command position with ganglinks and things running. not a bad idea, but perhaps not particularly useful.3. ""merge fleet"" could potentially introduce a whole lot of headaches. we have fleet links now, it's not such a hard job to click them. unsure about that.4. ""standing orders"" is a very, very good idea and gets my full support."
12/15/2008,"something that may need to be modified for the ""linkies:"" it's a pain when a fleet is a mix of several different alliances. in such a situation, you have to make sure that those from each alliance click an appropriate link from an alliance mate sl, wl, or fc.in lieu of ""merge fleet"" (which i would be in favor of, but let's assume it's not feasible): ability not only to send ""corp"" and ""alliance"" links, but ""blue"" links too (those with high standings to your alliance). while not quite as secure as corp or alliance-only links, it could help in many situations.additionally, i'd like to see the fleet window modified to show any fleet member's leadership level with some sort of icon (ie, chevrons or some such). this should help with finding replacement squad/wing leaders. i'll make a mock-up ui based on the op's ideas and mine tonight after work and post them here."

12/15/2008,"indeed, oz really held in there.my opinion is no, i don't think there was anything conclusive discussed there."
12/15/2008,"still waiting on ccp at the moment, they said it would be through some time today though. and yes, it was an epic meeting and i'm amazed i lasted through it considering i was operating with a severe hangover and 2 hours of sleep...mad props to the csm people who asked the questions, i think i managed to get one in, but most of the time i was kept busy typing like a lunatic."
12/15/2008,"and mad props to the 8 or so ccp representative for showing up on a sunday.it was a good meeting, the likes of which i hope to be able to attend more in the future (would be much preferable without an exploit to discuss though :p)."
12/15/2008,"meeting minutes have been reviewed and accepted, they will be published at 17:30 :)"

12/15/2008,":pi know, just could resist my fun. anyways ccp fallout indeed says it will be soon."
12/15/2008,how long does it take to publish chat logs. why the hell has it taken this long?
12/15/2008,because it's easier to post demands and scream failures than actually creating results.
12/15/2008,not really - to scream you need to navigate the forum interface. results might actually be easier here
12/15/2008,are the minutes actually coming out tonight?or did marketing excise so much of it there isnt anything to read
12/15/2008,minutes of the csm meeting are published
12/15/2008,"whitewash, total and absolute."
12/15/2008,"sorry to hear you feel that way, on your way out the door, please do not forget to contract me all your goods.thank you."
12/15/2008,"how so? it's not all the data, but they haven't had a chance to tie it all up with a bow just yet. we got a lot of important facts about it - it's been going on since at least march and possible since at least feb 2007, it's about 1/3 of the ferrogel market, it was ""a few trillion isk"", and so on. they don't have everything i want to know yet, but they seem to be making an honest attempt, and i'll give them the benefit of the doubt for as long as that's the case. they've done nothing on this issue to merit the contempt you're showing."

12/15/2008,"^^ this.i also believe ankh and lavista's discussions regarding npc corps and putting ""criminals"" into them is;1. unfounded2. unresearched3. uninformed4. ill thought out and ill prepared.a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.as i said before ankh, you do have a personal agenda. you do bend things to your will and i believe you are you tribe are dangerous for eve.you bend like a reed in the wind and back-peddle when necessary. there is nothing solid apart from your personal desire and ego.i will be voting tchell dahhn for the next csm if she stands. i also sincerely hope kublai also stands.look no further. with ank at the helm we will soon be flying around firing enchanted arrows from our ships and duelling each other! for the love of god, vote tchell dahhn at the next csm. at the very least, it'll keep things interesting personally i believe tchell is well informed on many aspects of the game and is equally able to hold a reasoned, sensible and logical debate about issues."

12/16/2008,"lonerider, shut up."
12/16/2008,agreed.when i pop a fool and some two day old clown comes along and so much as opens the wreck he should immediately flag (and there needs to be a lagtime before he even sees what's in the can. current mechanics have them flagging twenty seconds after they've hit warp!) to everyone involved in the fight (victor and vanquished!) and their respective corps/alliances.right now the system is just plain broken.

12/16/2008,kind of a fan of the current system..minus the asthetics of course..i like this new pos idea...maybe some sort of t2 / next generation pos...used purely for foward deployment of operations.dont like the anchor it at gate thing....but i think it should the follwing things should be noted:.: thes pops should not be able to claim sov.: these pos's should be anchorable anywhere is system..but not near gates..: these pos's should be detectable by probe and ship scanner.: u should be able to get an exact location on these pos's with probes.: limits to how many can be deployed in a single system.: limited weaponry (maybe a fighter bay...that pos gunners can drop fighters/ drones and control them...+ small stationary guns).: area of effect cyno jamming ability would be a nice feature (cant drop cyno within 1 au of it ?????...maybe).: should not be able to mine moonsit needs to be balanced...but as a foward deployment platform...this idea is sexy as hell
12/16/2008,"spike, scorch, and barrage are t2 ammos with per-weapon nerfs, so they only affect 1 weapon, keeping the nerfs at a relatively moderate level (they affect tracking).null, conflag, and hail nerf the entire ship (tracking and/or speed, massive increase in cap use, or reduction in cap regen rate) so every weapon loaded stacks with the others making for quite a hefty kick in the gonads. oh, and they can't hit anything... :/remove the nerfs entirely, adjust faction to have a unique role but not be the 'ultimate' necessity in pvp."
12/16/2008,tbh as mentioned previously...if the missiles get un-nerfed...so too must the speed.really speed was a little insane...but hell at least if u dropped a rapier / huggin on top of a speedy bastard vaga...he was dead... people *****ed..but never took the time to use the tools at hand to stop nano ships...hell i was killin more nano ships pre nerf than i am now...webs suck ass now and have no real use....not to mention the vaga.curse + sensor booster ii's + 1 x large neut + mates == dead nano if he declaoked within 72 km of u.huggin / rapier == dead nano if they ventured too close to your gangheyna == dead ceptor if they ventures too close or where not going insanely fastthese are all but a few effective counters to nano's pre patch....pitty the tools that complained so much didnt have any imaginination...now yall are whinging about the nerf...well i myself have moved on...hope ya like the new changes and that ya learnt what happens when ya open ya pieholes before using your inititive / brain.i support the rollback of missiles only if everything else gets rolled back too...otherwise i offer no support
12/16/2008,this is silly. missiles are now in line with turrets. turrets (especially bs sized) will do no damage at all when a ship is moving fast enough also. this has always been the case. you've pretty much always been able to speed tank a turret bs with frigs but that used to not work with a cruise raven. thats now been fixed.if you expect to fight small ships bring a small ship. if want to kill a bs with a torp ship bring a target painter. its as simple as that. the problem isn't the missiles its the failure to properly fit. now that missiles have tracking issues like other guns you need to start using mods that actually help you.
12/16/2008,"if your going to take this route then missiles need a dmg boost beyond what they got. seriously missiles have always been substandard to guns for most pvp, and now they get nerfed even more against the same sized target they were intended for (bs vs vs) (cruiser/bc vs cruiser/bc). not to mention there is no way to lower their ""transversal"" with missiles as compared to guns, because it doesnt matter which direction they are moving as long as they are moving. they dont even need propulsion mods in a bs, just be moving at full speed to take a huge dmg reductionlook at the numbers before spouting off how they are inline with turrets. and as far as fitting(l2play statements), i broke it down earlier in the thread about pvp mods, missile ships, armor and shield tanks. ave armor tanking ships have 7 lowslots 4 mids slots while ave sheild tankers have 6 mids and 5 lows. so where as shield tanks require 4 midslots(plus dc ii, and other lows if you need fitting reqs for torps), armor tanks require 5 lows. leaving you two dmg slots, plus your 4 mids. shield tankers are left with 2 mids so mwd and point? or painter and point in one of the slowest bs's?where was your missiles need nerfed against bs's before the qr release?? they weren't there. you're only spouting off at missile users because it was a mass of idiot missile n00bs that whined for the speed nerf(for the most part i dont support those missile n00bs either that want cruises to full dmg a frig) (the pvp mod reqs still affect the maelstrom but its a hole nother can of worms) the only other real missile bs worth anything is typhoon or scorp... and the scorp really doesnt count w/ its main weapon being ecm not torps.where do you put the painter on the solo raven? and before the caldari arent a solo race. every race should have the ability to pvp in a solo boat with their bs, caldari are mainly missile users, so having them retrain an entire weapon system just to solo pvp isnt adapting... its a broken weapon system that needs fixing.then where guns have tracking enhancers, a lowslot mod to help with their ""tracking"" where is the lowslot version of that for missiles.im not asking for a full roll back, im asking to get the numbers tweaked so we have a chance of doing something more than tickling our victims in a bs vs bs combat"
12/16/2008,"missiles and guns are not the same thing. they are different. differences make things interesting.you cannot fit a mid rack full of tank and a low rack full of damage, and somehow you don't see how this is balance? try fitting a geddon sometime and see how great armor tankers have it for midslots. every pvp ship needs to fit propulsion mods, not just shield tanking ships. megas and abaddons can't do dualrep tanks and expect to fit good weapons, and you can't fit heavy tanks on ravens/rokhs and expect to have a cakewalk with fitting, either.missiles and guns are not the same thing. they are different. differences make things interesting. do you see gallente whining for a blaster round that follows a target for 30 seconds, and will do full damage if he's webbed and painted before it hits?"
12/16/2008,"imo, a missile's explosion velocity should equal the average speed of the ship-class for that missile while running a t1 ab with lvl 4 in relevant skills. this would mean that smaller ships not using abs would most likely take full damage (adjusted for explosion radius), but if you aren't moving, you deserve what you get.if you are running a mwd on a battleship, you should be able to speed tank some of the damage dished out by a cruise missile, provided you are up to speed before the missile hits.what i don't agree with is a battleship being able to even partially speed tank a cruise missile without using at least an ab./supported, not because the nerf bat was swung, but because they swung too hard."
12/16/2008,"yes i was replying to the person who was stating that missiles were now like guns. i dont want missiles to become like guns i just want some numbers tweaked.getting into fit this fit that debates. i have cross trained to gall, amarr, and caldari. i can armor, shield, gun, and missile. i know the fitting nightmare of the geddon, but the apoc works just fine, or the baddon. infact right now amarr has the best bs class style ships overall.i know the fitting reqs and how to use those weapon systems. have you used missiles... do you understand their downfalls or are you just spouting random nonsense because in your mind it makes sense?the torp buff prior to qr finally brought the caldari a bs solo pvp platform that was comparable to one of the top tier solo bs's the mega.for caldari to active tank their shields they cant even fit torps. so they are negated to cruises, so by then even all those wonderful dmg mods they get to field only bring them up to a theoretical dps that only exsists if the target is moving at 0m/s. if caldari go passive shield tank, their tanks still take cap unlike passive armor tanks. and they still need fitting mods. that im all fine with. as far as baddon and mega cant fit good dual reps... yes we can both agree these platforms excell as passive tank beasts. and will outlast both passive and active shield tankers almost every time.i could deal with all of those problems, now you tack on a needed target painter/or web because some idiot cant even figure out that a bs sized weapon doesnt have an explosion radius to cover then entire bs sized ship with torps. the fact is, where does it go and the fact their explosion radius/velocity numbers are terrible thats where i have the serious problem. rokhs arent the issue here because they still use guns. the problem here is missile bs's and their needs. i guess the pvp torp raven was soooooo overpowered in bs 1 vs 1 it needed to be nerfed there. lawl-------------------------------------i do agree with you on one thing haakelen. different makes them interesting... but where i differ is that subpar makes them obsolete"

12/16/2008,"you can never please some people...i have been nothing but forthcoming to the events as i interpret them, without ccp intervention. yes, qa screwed up on letting this exploit through, but it was inevitable that it would happen sooner or later. yes, petitions screwed up on letting this get caught in the paperwork for 5 days. yes, the answers we have now are somewhat vague.if something like this occured in another game, what kind of response do you think you'd get. i've played many other games, and the usual response is ""it's something we can't fix, the code won't let us."" what you have now is a corporation that admitted wrongdoing in the t2o scandal (although they didn't handle it well), and who is willing to devote a lot of their time to sifting through the old records to find any traces of wrongdoing and take irrevocable action to the accounts.you call me ccp's lapdog, and you have that right. i have given you the answers based on what i got from the meeting, but i am still restricted by the nda. this exploit was a disaster monetarily, and it will take some time to fix, but we're not talking about big brother here. i advise you to be patient, and you can always reach me or my alt (krazeek) in the chatroom titled 'csm chat' or via evemail or convo.what more can i say?"

12/16/2008,"i'll probably have to put on my fire-******ant suit for this one, but i agree with what ccp is doing. if they release character names, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to link names to the alliances (unless they purged all info from that character's affiliation and all rosters) - people and places can do that in a minute.people know eve better than that by now. we'd have people who had nothing to do with this scandal all the sudden hunted down wherever they go, and if they try to join another corp, only about 2% of the playerbase would even take them. soon, they'd quit their accounts as they aren't able to do what they used to enjoy doing.yes, ccp is receiving a lot of flak for this, but i admire them for sticking to their guns. ccp is choosing to take the heat rather than innocent people in alliances which few people would be guilty, and playing the martyr."
12/16/2008,"and here i was thinking that the csm were supposed to be the players' representatives...regarding the previous post about some people never being happy etc. that may well be true.however, it's obvious from the published minutes that the exact nature of the length nd breadth of the issue from all angles is not yet established, or ccp were being evasive on purpose.the jury is still out on which of the two is fact."
12/16/2008,"my understanding of the eula was that even though we create the character we do not have any rights to it.name the involved characters, it's not like all of us have access to the player db and can connect a charname (thats not even our property) to a real world person.personally i feel that it is nessecary to at least ""name and shame"" the corps and alliances involved even if the characters involved are not named.hell ccp, why not turn this around and have some news regarding low grade or impure ferrogel being sold by these corporations and how they have been disbanded by the concord. just an idea but it may just dig your bums out of the fire here you could even write about it in eve chronicles"

12/16/2008,"yes, some people will never be happy and much more are happy only if they can wave some ""great conspiracy"" theory.i have some limited idea how a database search work and the thought of the time and manpower needed to check 4 years of game logs, probably needing ccp to set up several of the old builds on the internal server to see if the exploit was possible stagger me (think about it, boys, the need to load the old build and the old data to check for the exploit possibility and the towers using it, how much time that take? doen for each old build?).so while i want more informations when they will be available, what ccp has given so far is reasonable for the time elapsed. and remember, every hour they spend on this is 1 less hour on game development and optimization. so thums up to ccp and csm work so far. continue with it."
12/16/2008,the point is that someone that has been in the wrong corp or alliance for some time and did know nothing of the exploit and didn't even benefit indirectly from it will be treated as if he was one of the culprit. if you name and shame the alliance/corp people will not to differentiate between wrongdoers and simple bystanders.
12/16/2008,"does that mean i have a misguided faith in good nature of most people? because i believe the opposite, i believe that should we know the names of the characters banned, and their corporations, and alliances - community as a whole will be able to ferret out their associations. someone remembers doing business with them, someone remembers a name mentioned briefly, someone remembers mistake on forums, etc, etc, and the bigger picture comes out. for example, just because t20 was part of bob, i do not think for a second that everyone in bob are low life cheaters. nor do i believe that all goons are evil in game scammers, even though many are known for it. i think we should give credit to sensible people who would not paint everyone with the same brush. and, finally, the most important point for me personally: the scale of the cheating could not have gone unnoticed by the leadership of the corporation, and alliance. regular grunts might have benefited because they got cheap/free ships, or some t2 on the side, but it is the leadership that either chose to turn a blind eye, or willfully ignored, or even worse, was complicit in this mess. i personally am ready to believe a rank and file guys at ev0ke that they were not in any way complicit or were aware of the issue. i am, however, less eager to believe the leaders. because, should i be a leader of a corporation, or an alliance, whether i am a carebear, or i am an ardent fc, i am first, and foremost a manager of a large group of people - as a manager, and a leader, i have responsibility, for budgets, organization ops, for the isk spent and isk gained, and i should, and honestly would learn the sources and sinks. so yes, grunts really do get a pass, leadership people do not. and we mostly know who were the grunts, and who were the leaders in 90% of the cases, and the associations."
12/16/2008,"i couldn't agree more with jinx. and i would like to add that it is our right, of each one of us, to judge the information as we see fit. if some of us will use it as excuse to go after supposedly innocent people is because they have an agenda against those people and they would use any excuse, really. saying what we should or should not know, because you feel we are not prepared to handle it, is trying to be our big brother. which is not only offensive as it is dellusional."
12/16/2008,"now, if they had done that, they would have removed the wardec system altogether. they left the ability in to take on a corporation that gets under your craw, they just removed the ability to bring armageddon to the carebears.don't get me wrong, i was never decced by the privateers, so i'm not personally bitter about what y'all did at all. i think you took it way too far, though."
12/16/2008,"yeah, remember that one. i'd just bought it, and had it partially fitted out. by the way, that wasn't a wardec, back in the day, i was a can snatching fiend, and they bagged me fairly on that one. not that i'm complaining, mind you, i'd found some pretty interesting stuff in wrecks left at various gates. that time, i just got caught with my pants down."
12/16/2008,"yeah, god forbid that ccp have a clue about how they want to run their game... i mean, they coded it, and produced it... they obviously have no clue about whats happening....approve taking the limit off the number of war-decs, scaling war-dec fees and pirates/griefers/carebears all crying about each other!that'll fix everything!"
12/16/2008,"i like the idea overall, but instead of utilizing colonists for tax revenue, i'd rather see 1-3 'colonizable' planets per system, with a deadspace 2-room 'plex for each to determine system soveriengty. the first room is a designated defense room with a pg/cpu limit based upon sov level for the system allowing the controllers to place defensive structures within. there would be an accel gate within this room, requiring the aggressor to use hacking modules to unlock, but the defending alliance may use at-will. once unlocked, it stays unlocked for 24hrs. in the second room, there is a permanent tower that has about 150% the shields and armor of a normal large tower, needing to be fueled at about 150% of the fuel consumption of the large tower. the station would go into reinforced the same way as any other, but will go offline at 25% structure, opening access to the 3 hackable structures. once the aggressor hacks into these structures, the pos switches allegience, and the new owner then has to fuel, repair, and online the permanent pos before the colonization structure becomes available.the colonization structure is the true place where sov activities would occur. there would need to be 3 new npc goods: colonists, colony police, and colonial marines.soverignty is granted when you have a certain population of colonists in the solar system with a loyalty level greater than 50%. loyalty is determined by the number of colony police present on the colonies. each colony police unit present makes 5 standard colonists loyal, but do not affect colony population in of themselves. colonial marines are used to break the soverignty of a planet. each marine used in the colonization structure destroys 1 police and 2 colonists (or 2 police if there are no standard colonists left). once loyalty is reduced to less than 50% in the solar system or population is reduced below the minimum, the defender loses sov. however, all enemy police must be destroyed before the invader can begin landing his own police and colonists, and then needs to build up loyalty (and perhaps population) before they gain sov themselves.for game mechanic reasons, there may need to be a limit on how many colonial units can be transferred to the surface each day, in order to prevent instant sov switching.optional ideas:1) standard colonists on a planet that is loyal to a corporation generate a modest amount of isk as tax revenue to their masters each day based on population.2) colonist and colony police populations grow by 1% each day on their own.3) same as (1) except colony police require a small amount of payment in isk from the controlling corporation (the same amount each standard colonist generates).please let me know what you think of this.(edit: oops, forgot to support)"
12/16/2008,"i've heard suggestions similar to this before, and i approve of designs that head in this direction. obviously there are some details that need to be worked out, but the basic concept is a good one.some possible ideas regarding what colonies could do:* manufacturing colonies that produce certain npc trade goods (for example, mechanical parts)* mining colonies that produce conventional minerals (particularly low-end minerals) or moon minerals* construction colonies that, given a bpo and minerals, produce ships or modules over time* generic colonies that produce tribute (isk)* prospecting colonies that have a (small) chance of discovering a new moon material (this would allow ccp to introduce new sources of rare moon minerals* military colonies that aid in system defense by generating 'alliance navy' npcs in nullsec sovereign spacein general, colonies should probably be less efficient at doing things than players are (for example, they take several times as long to build a ship) but do so passively. they should also consume some form of supplies (food, water, etc).alternatively, instead of producing 'stuff' directly, they might enhance the pos that they support, or possibly all allied poses in the system. for example, each 'mining colony' might improve the output of moon miners by some (small) amount, or industry colonies might (slightly) reduce the time taken to build something in a pos."
12/16/2008,"using this thread i would like to (again) address the issue of macro miners & petitions. at the moment of writing it's pretty pointless to petition macro miners. ccp won't actually do anything with your petition except the standard reply saying ""thank you for your petition. we may, or may not, do anything with your petition. either way, we can't tell you. na na na na nah na"".as a direct result people are not inclined to file petitions and macro miners go unchecked though new eden.in order to combat the problem of macro mining i would like to make the following two suggestions:1) ease the ability to petitionit should be easier to petition potential macro miners. create a group for reporting macros and most important of all, allow to drag a player name from the local channel to the petition field. this way you won't have to type their twisted name in the name field. overall it should be a simple & easy task to report macro miners. afterall: less effort = more players willing to report.2) ccp needs to provide feedback about the petitionhere we have the biggest problem: ccp. in order for the system to work ccp will have to provide feedback. right now this isn't the case, players are just told to go **** themselves and stfu. this attitude ensures that player won't petition macro miners at all.since ccp hides behind the ""privacy concerns"" of their macro miners it will not be possible to get a result per case. but what ccp can do is provide a (for example) monthly report on the macro petitions.for example: ccp could release a report saying that in the month december there have been 150 macro miner reports. these reports concerned a total of 75 players. after investigating these 75 players it has revealed that 50 of them have been violating the eula and those players have been banned.this way ccp can still hold up it's privacy concerns and yet allow players to see that they can be taken seriously (as opposed to the current situation)."
12/16/2008,"most parts supported.nothing like monthly reports, but the petition system sure need an improvement"
12/16/2008,"in my time in eve, i've reported over 100 macro miners. i stopped because nothing was being done about them (of the 100, at least one of those had to be an actual macro, as i used a 5-point system to determine if they were or not. i support this document, and the tally would be a good read to let us know they are doing something..."
12/16/2008,petitions and customer support as a whole needs to be reworked
12/16/2008,"hell yes!""the game that shall not be named"" (wow) - gives reports (or used to) occasionaly about the people who used bots, etc...do the same here.auctioning off killrights on discovered macro miners would be fun too!petition=investigation, investigation reveals eula violation, investigation pumps out player kill rights contract - anyone can buy this for 5, 10 15 million, and has kill rights on this toon for a month...;)"
12/16/2008,"we all propably know that when there are lot of chat channels open it is sometimes hard to keep track on them.i would like to see if there was on option to display own text with some other color than the default white, while the other players just would see white text. the own text could be also highlighted in some other way? this would really help when having multiple chat windows open and when scrolling back and trying catch up with the conversations. also there could also be a feature which allows to color nicks of people in address book?i know this is propably not very important feature but at least it should be very easy to implement?please support/comment this idea and force the csm present it to the devs!"
12/16/2008,i can support that.
12/16/2008,we need something better (and considerably cheaper!) than a marauder as a dedicated salvaging vessel.currently if you can't afford to field a marauder you're stuck with destroyers or battlecruisers as salvage boats and their ability to suit the role just plain sucks.give us a tier 1 industrial hull with tractor range bonuses and % chance to salvage bonuses with decent unbonused cargo (3-4k) and modest speed.8 high slots (no turret slots). make them paper thin (they're flying jetcans...) but nimble.
12/16/2008,"thumbs, ofc."
12/16/2008,"i find my apoc works well as a salvage boat.that said i would indeed like to see some sort of salvage boat. i think it should be a non race specific ship, but that is just my opinion."
12/16/2008,why the heck not
12/16/2008,"dedicated salv boat would be very cool, indeed. for now, i use this:rupture6x salvs1x 10mw ii ab4 t2 cargo exp1 t2 nano1x cargo rigdoes 500m/sec, with 1000m3 cargo and 6 salvs. fast and nimble, can't be beat."
12/16/2008,"suggestion: redirect your efforts reference this thread over to ships and fittings, as this is the direction it is taking."
12/16/2008,/signed
12/16/2008,"destroyers and battlecruisers are fantastic salvagers, which makes me question the credability of the op.however i think a new t2 destroyer that gets cargo bonus, salvage success bonus and tractor bonus would be a fantastic move towards making the ""salvager"" profession even more profitable and to become more competative.so as much as i think you're wrong, i'm still going to agree."
12/16/2008,signed and agreed. this would be sweet
12/16/2008,"even if you get a dedicated salvage ship, you'll not earn more money!the reason is very simple.... if it gets easier, more people will do it, and prices will drop as the demand doesn't increase!in the end, you'll end up earning the same isk/hour....making things easier in a game like this is almost never a good idea, as the value of stuff is either determined by restrictions on supply (like officer/faction/complex modules), or by the amount of work it needs.rig components are priced like they are because that is what the eve population has determined it is worth compared to the work required.so no... bad idea!"
12/16/2008,see the above post. it'll not make any notable difference in earnings.....
12/16/2008,"the guy whos ship allows him to salvage 200 wrecks an hour will make more money compared to the guy who can only salvage a hundred.increased supply may drive prices down, creating competition for bigger hauls, and again the guy with optimized salvage capacity will make more money compared to the rest.see?more profitable and more competative.specualting on market effects sadly holds little water in an era where a giant salvage sploit could come to light that shows how major alliances duped wrecks to make salvage and flood the rig market.just saying ;)"
12/16/2008,"hell yes, i'll support this.""you, tchell dahhn? why?!"" you might ask... simple.my salvage boat of choice will always fly faster, and my skills will always be better than the mission runner who flies his giant tank through the skies.if you're going to get a bonus to tractor range and speed, this means i'm going to be able to salvage faster, and that's always going to make me more isk.you mission runners always seem to miss out on the obvious when it comes to ""the perfect salvage ship"", and this is the secret i've never been afraid to share with you. (sadly, it's your laziness which prevents you from seeing ""the big picture"".)try frigates. if you're ballsy, try an interceptor. (i have two.) for prestige, as i am ""the quintessential ninja salvager"", (heh, i'm modest too!) i fly an amarr navy slicer for salvaging.ask the many, many mission runners who fill my tank with their tears why they do it. it's because, no matter what ship you're fielding, i'm always, always faster. you might (might) get 1/3rd of your salvage and loot, but i'll get the other 2/3rds.here's the secret fitting - for two ships.the salvager. (i'll use my executioner for this one, as it was my first salvager, and has done me well.)lows: overdrive injector ii x 2mids: 1mn afterburner ii, small shield extender iihighs: salvager i x 2rigs: salvage tackle i x 3all at v, you'll get 1792m/s out of this ship, and with my current skills, i'll get 1448m/s. more than fast enough to beat any ship/tractor beam combo flying out there.once i'm done the salvaging, i'll swap out to my next ship.the looter.lows: interial stabilizer ii x 2mids: 1mn afterburner ii, small shield extender iihighs: salvager i, small tractor beam ithis one is awesome. basically - you loot the first can, drop your can behind you and fill it with the loot. target and tractor the can, set your speed for 500m/s and go around to loot all of the wrecks you just created. (sure, you can go faster if you want, but you'll risk losing the can at 20k, and you can't fill it once its outside the 1500m mark.)once you've loaded your 27,000m3 ""external cargohold"" you swap out for your industrial and come back to pick up all of the loot in one pass.this, my friends, is how the professionals do it. now, you can too."
12/16/2008,"tech 2 destroyer with 500% tractor beam bonus, and thats really all you need"
12/16/2008,"you make the (false) assumption that prices will stay the same. they won't!if a ship is introduced that's better at a certain task than all others in the game, after a suitable period (for skill training), that is what everyone doing that task will fly (excluding a few noobs).fafnir is wrong for that very same reason. the people who don't know what ship to use to be effective will already make less money today and may not migrate to a new dedicated one. the ones who do know which ship to choose will migrate, and since these are your worst competition, you'll not get any relative gain....salvaging today make a comparative amount of money (in isk/hour) as other activities for a player of average skill. if it was different, people would migrate away from what they are doing and start salvaging instead. same thing if you make salvaging easier. people will migrate until the equilibrium is re-established."
12/16/2008,"i believe that you are mistaken, as my comment has nothing to do with price, and everything to do with efficiency.if the tractor beams are made more efficient, i will still be able to gain a greater share (staying consistent with my current success) and yet, salvaging faster because the wrecks in the tractors are moving at an increased rate of speed towards their destination...in the end, if i'm salvaging 2/3 and the mission runner is salvaging 1/3, the up/down of the market means little to me."
12/16/2008,"yes to the idea, no to implementation. salvaging should be more of its own profession and less of a ""free lootz"" button for npcers.either allow tractor beams to be used on all wrecks, or make the dedicated salvage vessel a fast, agile craft with a salvage chance bonus."
12/16/2008,"they would not have to reveal what ccp does not want revealed, but simple statement like: i [we] can not, in good conscience, remain a member[s] of the body that is strictly for show. i [we] can not, in good conscience, be part of the system where csm members are threatened, or reminded of the nda, and thus brought into line, when greater good of the public, for whom csm was created, and whom we supposed to represent, calls for answers that we are not allowed to give. i guarantee you a 100% uproar on that one. too bad none of them will ever do it."
12/16/2008,"a big no to this. what if all of eve said ""give us darius and mollie's password!""it's against the privacy agreement, and would get them sued. i supported the idea, but if they have privacy contracts to follow, then they have privacy contracts to follow."
12/16/2008,"what, let's use the most absurd scenario? he he he."
12/16/2008,"like they were sued by, lets see he whose name begins with k... and shall not be pronounced? they didn't have any problems doing it then...now seriously, legally the privacy aggrement only covers real world information about the players. it has nothing to do with the characters."
12/16/2008,"ccp own all in-game content. alliance names, corp names and character names. since they own all that, they can easily disclose any or all of them and should.what they cannot and should not disclose are account login names or passwords or personal details."
12/16/2008,"i agree about disclosure of, at the very least the corps involved. this does not in any way breach individual user privacy and imo a virtual entity like a corp does not have privacy rights since it is content material of the game.if this were a short term thing i would not be bothered by none disclosure... but the lengths of time involved are considerable. and im sure more than a few of these individuals turned this expoit into a real world money tree for themselves.the only reason i can see for ccp making up excuses as to why they cant disclose this information is to save themselves further embaressment.perhaps the person who made the original petition should step forward and load some evidence and disclosure of the corps involved onto an external filehost and then post / pm the url to the csm or the author of this thread... that is - if he exists at all.linkp.s - you dont have to be a genious to see the amount of ferrogel exceeds the supply of dysprosium. a correctly configured database would spell this out so even a dyslexic alzeimers patient might see it."
12/16/2008,"csm is supposed to be a way for the players to be heard at ccp. ccp created the csm, but don't have to listen to them as shown by the last meeting. why bother having the csm when ccp simply ignores it?the only options we have as subscribers is to complain and when that doesn't work, our last option is to simply vote with our feet. i have no idea why we cannot know who exactly were exploiting this last bug?? was it a major alliance who shifted some war? while the characters who were exploiting this bug may have been banned, their alts who have no affiliation may still be in game, as well as anyone who benefited from this influx of isk (industrialists supplying them). this exploit has given the organizations who benefited from it, an unfair advantage. while the direct beneficiaries of the exploit have been banned, the indirect beneficiaries haven't been punished."
12/16/2008,"i like how nobody alts come saying they don't want the names disclosed, while genuine and known alliance are all demanding names for the blood throne."
12/16/2008,maybe the people at ccp believe that the character names really are the names of the players... which would be rather confusing if you consider some people have multiple accounts....
12/16/2008,no.
12/16/2008,op makes up his own figures and claims them to be fact. it is not ccps or the csms job to pander to conspiracy theorists who will never be happy.nothe op should take the advice in his sig but lacks the courage of his convictions. he looks like another whiner who does nothing else except complain.
12/16/2008,"the objective of the csm, as i understand it, is to coallate information from the playerbase, and then bring that information to ccp as a singular entity. they are an avenue of intelligence into the playerbase from ccp's perspective, and a voice for the playerbase from our-own. they have no authority over the decisions ccp make, and therefore cannot be held responsible for the actions taken by ccp.ccp are well within there bounds to ignore/disagree with the csm on every issue thats brought forward.my knowledge of the csm and other forum shennanigans however is limited, so if im wrong in this, feel free to correct/ignore the above.in conclussion the csm advise ccp as to how the playerbase feels/thinks and little more, and so i disagree with the op.also... first post"
12/16/2008,"please direct me to the thread where 218,500 players requested this information.not only can you not count, your reasoning abilities are flimsy.the csm got answers in a quick and direct manner and asked the questions players wanted asked.this is a lot more efficient than the method we used before the csm existed. what was it called? oh yes. the threadnought.so, finished trolling yet?"
12/16/2008,"i'll start with the csm bit. it seems people still think of this as some oversight committee, put in as a response to earlier problems in the game. everything i've read from ccp on the implementation of the csm feels to me at least, that this is intended to be a community relations council. basically something you go to when you want to feel out how the community feels on subjects, and having it done up in a nice little report. i'm sure they're more than that, but oversight of ccp of any significant impact isn't one of them.on to the topic, which is the naming of characters, their corp and associated alliances. i'll ask simply enough, how do you prove they had any knowledge at all of what was going on with the moons. the people involved in this didn't just dump this stuff on the market in a way that doubled or tripled availability. so naming anyone that might possibly have been involved, no matter what their level of knowledge of the exploiting was, will instantly be branded as cheats and have people demanding their expulsion from the game as well. this would amount to little more than a witch hunt, with people leaving the game not due to guilt, but due to disgust with what the players had become. in my opinion, ccp is well within their rights to not release names, as it'd bring negative attention to those that may have done nothing wrong. they should at least release the numbers of people involved, and just how far reaching this exploit was if they can track that, along with the final number of those banned. however, with an exploit that goes this far back, the investigation will take time. this isn't something that goes well with the ban them all now crowd, but they do need to make sure they get the right people. otherwise, they might as well just become the next blizzard, and ban recklessly, then have to make corrections and account credits when they realise they screwed up yet again. they obviously took out the accounts that were still doing it, now they have to try and prove the ones that weren't so obvious about it.lastly, i feel ccp does need to, in addition to the above, find out what went wrong when this was originally reported and correct it. if it was a misfiling of it, why wasn't that caught and corrected. they could simply say the company they had outsourced their support calls to screwed it up, but i hope we get a bit more than that."
12/16/2008,"knowing how was involved is not as important as knowing that proper action will be taken. so if you think your favorite punching-bag alliance are a bunch of exploiting anusholes, you'll still be happy to know they'll lose a titan or two. (if the isk can be traced to them)the question is then, how far is ccp willing to follow the isk. not, who was it."
12/16/2008,"we need a poll then, who didn't hear about the affilated partys involved raise your hand.btw, i'm not raising my hands."
12/16/2008,"my sig is a compliment to the guy who made the worst pr statment i have ever seen. that in times of george w bush is a high standard. it is a gift...and no, i won't stop playing. no matter how much it infuriates people like you. i suggest some anger control for you.i see you can't read. so i will repeat myself.in any democratic process those who abstain are ignored. it is this way in the real world and it is as it should be in eve or anywhere else. you can't know the opnion of those who didn't give it to you, so you work with the opinions you have. your argument is completely groundless.i agree with you, but that is not the point here. the point is that the great majority of people asked for disclosure, the csm carried this request and was ignored. the csm was created because of the very negative publicity on t20 incident and how it was handled as a publicity stunt to show ccp would have representatives of the players working with them to assure transparency. i see no transparency here. i rarely see something that remotely leads to that, coming from the csm. and in the rare occasions i do see it, ccp completely ignores the council."
12/16/2008,"this is the stupides tthing i have read all day, the reasons being:1)an inability to read would prevent me from interacting with you in this forum and forming replies based on what had been written, lest i was being read to by a third party, which is time consuming and most unlikely.2)an inability to read would prevent me from reading the repetition, making it even more pointless than it could already be judged to be. unless you're some kind of country bumpkin who believes i am consuming magical beans at this very moment that allow me to become literate in a matter of minutes.please think before you post.this is not a forum where being stupid gets your idea across or makes you credible.i can read, you being a witless troll is the problem.democratic process!shouting like a troglodyte in the street isn't democratic process.online pixelated spaceship games are not democratic process either.the ""reply"" button is not a vote in some world changing policy.but the voting system for electing the csm was democratic process with votes allocated ot every subscriber and the outcome being decided by those votes.i hope you can see the difference.should we comment that so far only 7 people agree with you. everyone else seems to be ""abstaining"" and thus not count..."
12/16/2008,"no, they shouldn't."
12/16/2008,"and i see you base your argument in... oh wait you don't!it doesn't matter if it is online pixelate spaceships or the ellection of your garden club president, both processes are based on democratic principles. and replying is actually a vote in some world changing policy. it is just not the real world, but some pixelated world that is very important for you, considering your angry, irrational and diconnected posts. i suggest you look for help. as this anger can make you ill, and i mean in the real world, not in the pixelated world you so much care about."
12/16/2008,no.it's not.you fail at politics and forms of govenrment.where are those thousands of people who agree wiht you now?damn... guess they're abstaining or something...
12/16/2008,"ethoyou no longer seem to be debating your original post, and now seem to be attacking other peoples views.perhaps now would be a good idea to re-think or re-iterate your original point...?"
12/16/2008,yes they should.
12/16/2008,"again you base your arguments with flwless logic. oh wait there are no arguments here, yet again in the same exact place the thousands of people who disagree with me are. disagreeing with other people views is called debate. as long as it is kept rational and argumentative i like to debate. i find it very healthy. you seem to dislike it though. so why exactly are you posting this?"
12/16/2008,"i fully support this, but i don't think they will do it... @ the op: stop trying to argue with the goon. it is pointless, goons are trolls."
12/16/2008,"oh my apologies i thought we were debating the position of the csm.its pretty clear that you... are not.must of being the topic title confused me, but by all means continue to ""debate"" democracy with jah'ret khan, it really reinforces your op.i'll see if i can get the powers that be to change the topic from ""should csm members resign"" to something more suited like ""my views on democracy"""
12/16/2008,"the representativity and relevancy of the posts in this forum was questioned. i explained that those who ommit themselves are ignored in a democratic process. the whole point of the csm would be moot otherwise, because neither their positions nor any motion in this forum will ever have more than 10-20% of the total player base.so discussing about democracy is actually closely relately to my motion. if you think the representativity of the people who post here is enough, the people that called for transparency in mass, althoguht they are not thousands, then the csm should be adamant about the will of those who ellected them and resign if not listened to.if you think the representativity of the people who post here is not enough, the csm is not a legit voice for the player base and there is no motive for it to exist.either wai it should be disbanded..."
12/16/2008,"you seem to be under the impression that the csm has the power to change things, as long as the majority vote for it"
12/16/2008,"i am not. and that is the main motive i opened this thread. the csm, as it is, is just a pr stunt by ccp. it works as a facade so ccp can pretend it listens to its playerbase, which it does not. if the csm has no power and can't change things, at least its members could deny ccp this facade."
12/16/2008,"what makes you think i'm angry? i'm laughing my arse off at your failthread where you suggest the csm should resign over this exploit and the lack of support it's getting. i'm laughing because you think you are entitled to know more. i can tell you now that you will never, ever get what you think you are entitled to and the csm will not resign.you however, are still posting your opinions and stating them to be fact.imo your sig is the best statement ccp have ever made because it puts you firmly in your place doesn't it? it tells you exactly what i'm telling you."
12/16/2008,"i am quite happy with both supporters and contenders in this thread. both have prooved my point. and i am under no illusion that the csm will resign. their resignation is not as important to me as the discussion itself. thank you for keeping it alive.you are entitled to disagree with me and prove wrong, mr alt. unfortunately i don't see anything in your words beside emorage disguised as trolling."
12/16/2008,"what exactly would knowing banned character names accomplish?forgive me for saying this, but this just sounds like rubbernecking to me."
12/16/2008,"this was addressed in my first post, perhaps you overlooked it.the csm has no power over ccp they advise, end of story i think."
12/16/2008,"but you have yet to answer the question. what exactly would this accomplish?if you were to get names of banned characters, corporations, and alliances, what purpose would this serve? is it so you can go about 'serving your own plate of justice'? keep in mind there may be players/corporations which had nothing to do and may have not even been aware of what was taking place.the damage has already been done. knowing banned character/corporation names won't solve anything. it will just spur some of our most 'self-rightous' players to perform their own form of ""vigilante"" justice on whomever might have exchanged a ""hello"" with such offenders.really, i think the community can deal without the extra griefing at this time."
12/16/2008,that is exactly my point. can you point me a single situation where the csm existence made a difference at all?
12/16/2008,"it would serve the same purpose it serves to expose corrupt politicians in the papers. name and shame them, and by association those closely related to him.if nothing else it would serve to prove the innocence of those that are unrelated to them. as it is now, lots of accusations have been thrown by a lot of people. some of these may be right, others may not. in the absence of information both guilty and innocent end stained, though."
12/16/2008,perhaps it's because the csm is wasting time and effort asking the wrong questions.instead of concentrating on the whodunit!1! how about they work on how to avoid this from happening again in the future.
12/16/2008,now you're just being ignorant.watch the csm panel video from fanfest 2008 and they address this question and answer it.your thread is an excuse for you to ***** about the csm because you don't like it.troll.
12/16/2008,"they're perma-banned character names, not real life politicians. and what if their close associations had nothing to do with the exploit? what if they weren't even aware of what was going on?you're already talking about naming and shaming their ""close associations"", whether they had anything to do with it or not ."
12/16/2008,"while the op is a bit off his rocker, the basic point he makes is valid. what good does having the csm do for us? nothing. the only thing it does do is make us think that ccp is actually hearing our grievances as compared to never reading our posts on the forums...when they actually were.so, instead of passively waiting for ccp guys to read our ideas and so forth, we now have an outlet to actively send them info on issues we consider important.the ultimate problem with the csm, as with the original method of making suggestion topics in the forum for them, is that ccp is not beholden to accomplish anything the suggestions or csm propose. at all. that's like having the ultimate veto power.the greatest issue the csm faces is that it's not a meeting point for equals, like parliament and the us congress is supposed to be, but is instead more like a religious interface where one can pray to the gods and hope for a blessing.the csm needs a house of players, house of developers, and a prime minister. and ultimately, be able to decide the direction eve takes, not just provide feedback or suggestions. no one should be above the law, and right now the dev side of the table is above the law.before the 'this is a game, not rl' crew comes along, let me just say that it was ccp who decided to create some form of metagaming organization that became the csm, making reality and virtuality begin to blend."
12/16/2008,"people complained ccp didn't listen to them and were evil corrupt monsters or something.ccp gave us a direct avenue for them to listen to us.the csm take the concerns, questions, ideas and grievances of the players to ccp.and ccp listen.and where ccp are led to believe work is needed and can be done, work is done.from what the csm said they were also shown how it is ccp now police themselves and are satisfied that this process works and there will not be another t20.ccp need veto because the honest truth is that a whole pile of players have stupid ideas and say stupid things, so the worst ideas that will damage their game and their company (not yours, you didn't programme it or fund the company 15 years back, you just pay to be allowed to play their game) will be taken out.they've given us a voice.not control, not a mandate or whatever, just a voice.and they will listen to that voice and when they agree with us they will act.this is not a diplomatic organization where we, the unwashed masses, call the shots. this is a business and the livlihood of hundreds of people, so they will call the shots.it was never sold to us in any other form, and no promises were made."
12/16/2008,"they have given us a farse. nothing else. we already had a voice, it was called the forums. we don't need the csm to have a voice, and they are completely inconsequent at this."
12/16/2008,i do find it amusing that this issue requires the csm in order to get anywhere further than a forum thread.
12/16/2008,is it going any further?
12/16/2008,"no, in my opinion."
12/16/2008,"so, it does not need the csm after all, does it?"
12/16/2008,your conclusions represent the diametric opposite of all indications given by the facts.
12/16/2008,"then please list the said facts and the correct conclusions, please. if possible in an objective way."
12/16/2008,/me abstains
12/16/2008,can we try to not bash the csm every bloody freaking stupid assed day of the week and try to cut it down to once a month?
12/16/2008,"i look at the eve in game browser and cry. it would be a very handy tool to have a fully functional browser in-game. say one wanted to look up some info about a ship, instead of using the broken browser or switching apps, the person could just use the eve browser to find it faster and it would put a lower load on the user's computer."
12/16/2008,would be a kool feature :)
12/16/2008,"it'd be nice, yeah. but failing that, the ability to completely and totally disable the igb would be a welcome addition, considering how buggy and dangerous it is."
12/16/2008,"the igb does blow, but bear in mind with cosmos looming on the horizon i am sure the browser is getting revamped to be able to use its features in an acceptable manner."
12/16/2008,"/signed - one of the three obviously and painfully bad software subsystems in eve(the others being evemail and the forums). any time i can seriously advocate internet explorer 1.0 as a major upgrade, the browser has some issues."

12/16/2008,"when the station's dock range is fixed for good. for now, i support the idea."
12/16/2008,"would definitely make stations harder to lock down, but then again, it seems ridiculous to be able to pull it off with just a hictor..."

12/16/2008,"hell no. if your so scarred by eve then just leave. accidents happen in all games. just that eve's tend to be more pronounced due to the single server. the t20 business is not the reason bob is a power. the richest alliance in the game doesn't mean its the most powerful. it comes down to the leadership and the skill of its members. the moon scandal resulted in many bans. those people paid for it with losing out on the rest of the game. i think the problem is fixed. you seriously need to quit this whole ""i'm so depressed in ccp, they cheated us all"". i'm sorry, this is their game. make your own then you can demand what you want. to err is to be human. --isaac"

12/16/2008,"yep, that or have a solar system map on the scanner window."
12/16/2008,"then how about skill application...such as you train a missle skill and if the skill is relevant to another, it aids slightly in the other skill."
12/16/2008,done with proper moderation and limits this could work out fine.
12/16/2008,"first you say that you want to help carebears switch from industry to pvp...then you say you want to limit it within certain classes.so could you decide which way you want it?and maybe stop pretending, that you want to help carebears pvp, and say what you really mean - that the fotm (foty) has changed, and you want to fly the best ships again...as for your examples with gunnery skills impacting other types of guns - this is how it already works, you get one skill for a type of turret plus a lot of support skills that impact all turrets.same with navigation, engineering, mechanic skills etc.as it has been said many times before - such concept works in other games as you have limited number of skills (levels) that you can achieve in most of them. in eve there is no limit, and each skill can be useful, so there is no point of introducing such system."
12/16/2008,i'd really love this feature if it became real!never will though unfortunatelty!
12/16/2008,"i dunno.this whole skill thing seems like an outdated concept tbh.i think eve needs a apradigm shift.maybe we should look into a system where skills advance by practicing them?then thes epeople with no usefull combat skills jsut need to fight until they are good at it.a clear positive outcome for all.actually, this idea is so good, it might need it's own thread."
12/16/2008,i gave 2 options to this thread.i don't really care about the nerfbat effects.. to be honest i started to train amarr frigate and i now regret it... wish i could apply those points to a different skill.
12/16/2008,thumbs up
12/16/2008,"it would be nice, but i doubt ccp will go for it. it would make it too easy for folks like me, to ""read between the lines""."
12/16/2008,"i enjoy the tl:dr version they publish.main thing is they are minutes and not chat scripts... as is standard for company meetings.it covers what is discussed in an informal manner without getting bogged down in exact words and minutia.if any csm felt misrepresented, they should have full right to protest."
12/16/2008,"a full log of the meeting is usually provided for csm only chats. th eonly time th elogs aren't provided are for the csm/ccp chats. i did pass on an edited log with nda removal notes in it, but the problem is that in roughly 50 lines of chat text, you'll have 2-3 questions being asked/answered, some of which is nda covered, some of it not. so after editing the log and reading through it, i actually found it difficult to follow some of the discussion and i was there taking the minutes...so, while i wouldn't mind posting them, it really is up to ccp and in the past they have decided it isn't a good idea."
12/16/2008,support team and resources [star]afaik have the power of being ops in the help channels.how about these same guys or perhaps a new group to simply op the trade channels. kick-mute people who say racist things. kick-mute clear scammers.trade and resource disciples could be a good name?

12/16/2008,4 sentences is too long to read? boy perhaps you should stop coming to the forum.
12/16/2008,tl;drquoted for emphasis. (on the length and unimportance of treelox's post)
12/16/2008,you want to burden ccp with more unnecessary things and divert them from focusing on what is important?no thanks...
12/16/2008,"i agree that there needs to be some manner of moderating trade channels.i'd also like to see someone moderate jita local channel... muting clear scammers for an hour at a shot.i wandered through there to pick up a few items and just for a lark checked out every spammed contract in local.32 contracts examined.1 legitimate contract (for the actual item advertised, at the correct price!!!).the scam-spam in jita is just out of control."
12/16/2008,what does ccp have to do with it? volunteer program?nah local should be where scamming is allowed.
12/16/2008,trouble with using a volunteer program is that is the posiblility of moderation powers being abused by volunteers. there would have to be a very comprehensive set of rules that mods have to abide by..are you refering to solely the rookie chat?
12/16/2008,i don't have an issue with scamming... it's the freakish spamming going on that i find highly annoying.i bet 50% of the lag from jita is just local channel alone. someone needs to kick the scam-spammers in the vitals.and i don't care if it's a volunteer system and is abused. abusers won't last a hot minute.
12/16/2008,"funny thing is that information is all available on the site.faq 10-5support team and resources [star]star is the branch of the volunteer program that helps with player support. we specialize in helping players, new and old with any questions or problems they may have. one of our duties is to personally greet new players, giving them a good start in the game as well as welcoming them to the eve universe. we also maintain a presence in the help channels providing moderation, support and answering questions where required. our work can be challenging but is also extremely rewarding."
12/16/2008,"yup seen it and read about it, but given the state of the help channel/rookie chat they seem overwhelmed and unable to keep up, as rookie chat is a cesspool of spam still. and i see you are rolling out all your alts to support all your proposals."
12/16/2008,"why would scammers be muted? this is eve, scams are legitimate."
12/16/2008,when profits become less for missions? maybe they go somewhere else? maybe rigs drop in price and pvp can use them? then again on the otherhand if salvaging is less valuable... less people would do it... it self balances and even if what you propose happens... it's only good for the 0.0-pvp people. which is the way ccp seems to be pushing things.
12/16/2008,garbage to collect garbage?tbh my hurricane is doing quite well. has paid for itself over and over... and i built it using minerals from salvaging. good stuff.
12/16/2008,"nice to see the ""edwards"" clan coming out to support the op.....tl;dr = no"
12/16/2008,"i agree that there need to be more faction cruisers... they're cool toys, very few are halfway worthy combat ships.but i also want a dedicated salvaging boat other than a marauder (currently i have 1 marauder running the missions, another right behind it salvaging... a 750m salvage boat is just ludicrous).make two versions, t1 and t2, based on a tier 1 industrial hull. 8 high slots (no turrets), decent speed, 3-4k cargo.t1 gets a 50% tractor range, & +25% salvage chance.t2 gets a 100% tractor range, & +50% salvage chance."
12/16/2008,"what in god's name do you need a second marauder for? one cleans a room just fine - you kill about as fast as you salvage. i wouldn't object to a dedicated salvage ship, but that's a bad argument."
12/16/2008,they mentioned at a fanfest that the reason for the delay the next tourney was because of rising costs of production. it would be interesting in knowing how they have solved the problem and what changes have been made in the way the next tourney will be run.

12/16/2008,what a joke. this had no new information. you can find more accurate and detailed information elsewhere.i have an exploit petition open right now... completely unrelated to this pos exploit but still... been 3 days with no response. still no response as of making this post.so... ya um...nope it's filed under exploits.i've even made another petition after this one asking a question if it was against the eula-policies to scan down mission runners and to steal mission objective items. that was answered... and has been closed...exploit is still open.tbh i've had nothing but good experiences with the gms except 1 gm. i have a feeling that gm is a bot or something because i know 5+ people who have had identical responses from this gm. letter 4 letter.is it time to stop filing petitions? just as i've been forced to stop filing bug reports because of how many are filtered and ignored with no response; to which the bugs make it to tq...
12/16/2008,"was the response to your petition that the theft was an exploit? i assume that the response was ""no, it's fine, learn to play"" or some variant thereof, and thus saying that the ""exploit"" is still open is wholly misleading. as for the gm in question, what exactly is wrong with letter ""4"" letter identical responses? petitions will largely fall into a handful of common groups, and any gm who doesn't have their answers to those pre-written(either for cutting and pasting or just memorized from frequent use) is mad. if you answer the same question in 100 different ways, you're a bad gm - consistent responses are far better."
12/17/2008,"i refered to these ""thieves"" as ""salvagers"" to show them in a different light. and the whole point of stealing is that there is a high reward for low risk. *shakes head disbelivingly* thats why people don't like it. should ore thievery cause a rule rewrite? my corp simply blew the ore thieves away when we had trouble with them. also you whole idea rests on the ""laid final blow"" idea. this is open to abuse aswell. a player can then zap an almost dead target milliseconds before your final salvo hits home. then what eh? in the end its twisted scrap in space. its anybodies to take unless they can defend the kill. watch the discovery channel and see how nature works the rules. no rules. i have an idea. make a friend. get the friend to loot the wreck while you guard it. you have a brain you have options. immvo there should concord protection if you are destroyed in high sec space. protection of your wreck if you some how come to grief. new professions need encouragement. i see nothing more noble or grand about blasting an enemy to pieces than i do in ""salvaging"". its all a game man. i think its funny that they get your loot and your goat."
12/17/2008,"it shall be there, and i appreciate your vote. tell your friends."
12/17/2008,you know there would be a known alias history for this but by all means let fear and narrowmindedness guide you.

12/17/2008,i totally feel your pain.
12/17/2008,"serenity, the main goal of the suggestion was to be able to pool items for use by an alliance, allowing corporations to give and take as needed in an efficient manner. corporations already have this ability for their employees via corp hangars. i was merely suggesting the next logical step, allowing alliances the same ability. since this apparently will not happen due to ccp manpower limitations, alliance-only market orders would not be the worst compromise i could think of. unfortunately, i cannot think of a system that would be anywhere near as elegant as the drag-and-drop simplicity for players that an alliance hangar would provide. even if it would require major changes to the code, based upon the support this thread has garnered, it would be a good endeavor for ccp to undertake for the happiness of the player-base."
12/17/2008,bump.
12/17/2008,for great justice.
12/17/2008,"yeah, then you lose some skilltraining, maybe even a whole day! mountains topple, nations in panick, life as we know it ceases to exist etc..."
12/17/2008,agreed.
12/17/2008,"you don't 'have' to. you can let your skill finish if you want, then start training again when you log back in. the only option you don't currently have is the lazy one where little pixie fairies change your skill for you when it's done."
12/17/2008,to be honest just having a single backup skill ready to run after a shorter one finished when i'm at work would make me very happy. there are always a bunch of skills ready for level iv - v which could act as backup.
12/17/2008,"full skill queue, no; but at least having one backup skill for when your currently training skill runs out, yes yes yes!"
12/17/2008,"i, too, would like to see an improvement in the utility of blaster boats. sometimes i can get away with warping in, bookmarking something, then warping out and then warping back in on top of the target. other times i have to ""slowboat"" on afterburners with overdrives to get to my target, who usually has about a minute or two (60km at 400m/s) to shoot me with their long-range weapons and sentry drones.so for now it's sitting back, or getting on the afterburner and running away, and finding a quiet spot from which i can snipe with railguns and sentry drones.perhaps if the hyperion had a reduction to minimum warp distance to eg: 50km, we could have a solution to the problem of closing with the target?"
12/17/2008,6 months of training on my blaster pvp account wasted.. yep supported.
12/17/2008,"i must have missed the portion of the corporation interface that shows what the production of each station is. sure, i can see what's deployed in space. i can see the size of the wallet. but i can't see what people have put into or taken out of silos or reactors in a pos. i can't see what people have sold under their own name on the market.so it's entirely feasible that the folks responsible for this fiasco were doing so on their own bat, using sovereignty pos to host their broken reactors, shipping goods on their own time and pocketing the profit themselves.i would go so far to suggest that corporations which are still active are obviously not involved in the ""grand scale"" exploitation that was happening recently. so pointing fingers at currently-active corporations to suggest that they were exploiters looks to me like you're engaging in a witch-hunt."
12/17/2008,"yeah, why fight for change when you can just run away like a little girl?"
12/17/2008,"you can see:1) what is in each person's hangar (you should check from time to time your directors...2) how much money and assets are your operations generating and what these operations are.sure if the person in question used all the cheat money for personal gain, and personal gain only, it is harder to realize. but if your corp or alliance is receiving extra hundreds of billions of isk from nowhere each month, you would be stupid not to ask yourself how..."
12/17/2008,"depends where they kept it. if it wasn't in a corporate office or hq - you'd never see it. how so? if i deploy a corp pos it will register as deployed in space and evemails will come in from time to time about fuel or combat, but what i put into it or take out of it doesn't show anywhere. if i transfer it to an alt for selling on the market or sell it personally and not via a corp wallet - that won't register either. thats a different story for sure, however many players would say the sold gtc's, ratted, pirated, scammed - and hit the jackpot with a working system."
12/17/2008,"i think you are working very hard at trying to twist things out context, and excusing an unacceptable behavior with willful obfuscation.if you are a leader of an alliance, or a ceo of a corporation, or even a member of the council or directorship - you have to ask questions about things, and learn about operations of your entity. what you have described above as an excuse for ""not knowing"" is exactly what i mean by ""turning a blind eye"" to the problem. if you run an alliance, or a corporation, you learn how isk coming in, you learn the numbers, which are pretty standard, you will learn the general lay of the land, so to speak. you would also be able to compare numbers and contributions coming in from different corporations, and how all things interact. you many not learn significant intricacies, but i am sure as hell you would notice if one or two of your corporations would start posting record gains and contributions. i am sure as hell that those with isk will always will out, and if i was in a possession of the exploit, and wanted to keep it quiet i would subvert the leadership with the unlimited spending power i posses. in any event, what you said equates to ""blind eye"" and ""willful ignorance"" and as such can be used as justification. the whole thing operated like a criminal enterprise, and the trillions of isk acquired were at least partially spent on propping up the alliances involved, and if the leadership of those alliances and corporations chose to ignore the seemingly inordinate, and somewhat large sums of isk coming from limited sources, they are guilty due to their ignorance. i am not on a witch hunt, no matter how hard you would want to make it so. i am certain however, that the exploit was too big to be just a small hiccup in one or two 0.0 entities, and is actually a systemic problem that existed in limited circles for a very long time, again, due to the sheer scope of it - evoke and some ""other"" alliance are not the only guilty parties, it does not make sense if they are the only ones. best of luck in your further obfuscation efforts, they are rather transparent."
12/17/2008,"if you are a corp ceo you know how many towers your corp has and where they are and what modules are present in each of them. you will also know the modules existant in such poses and what they are there for.the quality of the moons and what come from them are also a very important information, as you will have to decide what needs to be protected.so basically you know all the activities your corp does to produce large amounts of money. if the incoming money is considerably greater than those activities could produce you should ask yourself where it is coming from.in none of these cases a player would be able to pour several hundreds of billions of isk into a corp. and even if by some miracle he would it should arise at least the curiosity of the ceo and directors of such corp to know where the hell it is coming from."
12/17/2008,"you assume that the ferrogel dupers were donating their profits into the corp, and not using the exploit for themselves. just because they were 'able' to put billions into the corp wallet, doesn't mean they were doing so.if i had been running a scheme like this, the vast bulk, if not all of the profits would be going to my own npc corp alts."
12/17/2008,ccp won't disclose anything when its not spilled out by someone on a 3rd party forum. even then they try to tell just enough to silence the majority. best thing we the players can do is ask more and see what the response is.how big was ev0ke's and affiliates stake in this all?what happened with the isk anyway? was the most of it spent or sitting in some accounts?will ccp try and hinder people trying to find out the names of the rest of those 70 people?did ccp caught laundering alts suspected ask isk farmer white washers which turned out to be affiliated with one of these 70 people?were there cases of those 70 people related to rmt deals?will ccp try to take legal actions against some of these 70 people who violated the eula in such a way it can be proved that ccp was damaged financially?will ccp disclose information if there were ccp employees involved?since ccp already confirmed that once petitions and bug reports are submitted its impossible to remove them did they investigate what happened with them and who handled them? and if so will they disclose this information?will ccp research the effects of yet another scandal and if so will they make the results public?even when a player is smart enough not to get greedy with his undetected duping and using a anonymous alt for this will it still be possible to get caught by some randomized ccp investigation?does ccp investigate reports of misconducts submitted by people who read it on 3rd party forums?did this whole scandal result in a renewed discussion about prioritizing resources on eg. gm/qa/dev?is ia investigating as well and if so when/how will they report to the public?
12/17/2008,"exactly. and they could easily be donating enough of the proceeds to the corp to qualify as ""standard"" moon mining. by donating masses amounts in the manner you should suggest probably would raise alarm bells, and therefore risk the exploiter becoming exposed to spies or his own corp/alliance ratting him out."
12/17/2008,"edit: on second thoughts, can't be bothered."
12/17/2008,support + 1
12/17/2008,this is an ideal way to use the bounty hunters to your advantage. if and when bounty huntng is revised you can hire them to weed out your hated singular enemies.
12/17/2008,"well it happened and you are in the csm now, can anything be done to get the speed of back to the way it was? is ccp just going to let us all quit playing? seems so i am on a 5 day free pass and came to check to see if any hope exists to get this changed back?i have little to no 0 hope for good news about this issue, but it would be great to hear from csm about the chances of someone at ccp coming to their senses."
12/17/2008,"the great speed nerf is really heart breaking. they basically reduced the number of tactics available for pvp. and completely gutted a few great ways to have fun in eve.i want the old devs back. these new people aren't the ones who made the game. they are not hardcore, they are mainstream"
12/17/2008,"agree and have stated these same words many many times myself, i kept asking myself why all the bad choices all of a sudden, then after digging into all the changes at ccp it all came clear, those guys aren't working on the game anymore just the drunken jackasses you see in the fanfest videos. oh well maybe they can keep duping people into paying for eve until it is dumped for the next game, i am always surprised how dumb the customers of game products can be."
12/17/2008,"eve ui should not be changed.it should be preserved as an operational example of how not to do things.i like dragging out eve at the office as a way of showing people that, no matter how badly they think they stuffed up, there's always something worse!""trash it"" right next to ""make active"". yup, doesn't get worse than that. i'd put ""leave ship"" in the ""dangerous"" section - if you leave a ship whose structure is only extant because of your mechanic skills, you're in trouble ;)an easier-to-read font wouldn't go astray, such as verdana for example. please, none of this gumph about the ""futuristic"" feel of the weird font. it's primitive and pays no attention to a hundred years of typography."
12/17/2008,oh man... does this ever need to be done. after i've been erm drinking some erm coke... hitting those small lines perfectly become difficult; often i hit trash on my ship when i'm trying to get into the ship. then have to close that.. what happens if i miss again and hit yes?luckily you can petition

12/17/2008,already in the pipeline.
12/17/2008,"i like the proposed change. however, i think that there should be a separate system for subject loyalty and planetary invasion, as outlined in my above post, rather than an instant evacuation mechanic. this would make colonies a bit harder to conquer, but gives the possibility of subjugating a planet, rather than merely wiping it clean.another idea did come to me though, rather than a randomly determined output from colonies, why not have the ability to build and add industrial centers to planets? they should be reasonably expensive, and have certain maintenance requirements. they should also require a certain amount of colonists to keep it up and running. this ties in with the 'subjugation' idea in that an invading force would have a reasonable chance of capturing enemy industrial centers along with the planet (say 50% of them rounded down).i am going to work on some proposed industrial center ideas and re-post later once i get some reasonable consumption/production figures made for them."
12/17/2008,10/10 for incomprehensibility
12/17/2008,"okay we have several ideas already in play along with the previously proposed ideas, thanks to our csm delegate for the link, and now i think that ccp or the csm should put up an update post on the topic if it is in development currently. i don't think ideas should stop here on what could be done with this and encourage more posts for ideas. afterall, designers aren't always full of them and gamer input is valuable. from the csm or ccp i think either a list of ideas so far put forward or those decided on would be nice. gives us something to look forward to and follow the development on how it's going. hope to keep hearing about this and more ideas. thanks to everyone so far!"
12/17/2008,i like... but it would make the game very complicated in a hell of a hurry.so if they implement it... lets make sure they get the kinks ironed out./thumbs up
12/17/2008,"maybe add a small benefit/buff to having these. ie: if a corp has 1-2 planets/moons colonized then all pos'/stations in the system or constellation get a decrease in production time, research time, etc due to the new 'workforce' in the system? maybe add to a system where you can take 'workers' aboard your industrial ship and it increases mine time/yield in some way?just throwing ideas out there but i like the colonization idea"
12/17/2008,"please explain your 5-point system for identifying macrominers, and explain how i wouldn't meet the criteria.i mine in a hulk, with my alt. i'm not always watching local. my cspa charge is 1m isk. i do not answer people just because they mention my name in local.rather than kill rights, just name the system that suspected macrominers are operating in. then the real miners can go mine the system dry and remove the incentive for the macrominers to use that system. you don't have to shoot people to cause economic harm.i do support the idea of having ccp report on action taken regarding macro mining petitions.i do not support the creation of more categories of petition. in fact, i would suggest that all petitions go into one channel, to be filtered by specialist petition classifiers so that petitions about pos exploits or macrominers can't get stuck in the wrong petition queue for five days."
12/17/2008,"not going to see any chance soon, but supported."
12/17/2008,really have to support this.
12/17/2008,"not only support...but in contracts there's a system of ""find contracts with this item"" deal. obviously should be able to use the same mechanic?"
12/17/2008,chat readability would be much improved with tinting/colouring of chat text.i'd also like to have a more readable font.
12/17/2008,yes please.
12/17/2008,/signed.something like this would be awesome:linkage <3
12/17/2008,all for a friendlier ui.
12/17/2008,ooh! my esteemed colleague is on to something here... i'm really glad we have him now!
12/17/2008,"i already have a great salvage ship - it's called a cormorant. fitted with 5 tractors, 3 salvagers, overdrives and cap recharger this boat is all i need. i could fit salvage tackle and boost my salvage skill, then swap a salvager over for another tractor.drop the can, bookmark it and come back with the wreathe.speed is of the essence while salvaging. salvage chance (salvaging faster) & ship speed (getting to wrecks/tractor range faster). i wouldn't mind a bonus to tractor range/speed, but that doesn't really matter.i agree with the folk from suddenly ninjas, that the ""perfect"" salvaging ship can happily sacrifice cargo capacity for faster task completion. and i'm just a carebear mission-runner!oh, and for folks trying to avoid ninja salvagers, just complete missions faster, bookmark wrecks, hand in as quickly as you can, and head out with your fastest salvaging boat. or just pick another agent in a different system.edit: what i'd love in a dedicated salvage boat is a boost to salvager range."
12/17/2008,good point. a boost to salvage chance and range would be better.who knows maybe tech 3 will allow us to build our own salvage boat.military experts are calling it a possibility.
12/17/2008,"using a destroyer is the best option, but we could use better. a ship with bonuses to salvage and tractor beam modules. one with a fairly large cargohold and lots of low slots. respectable defense. screw any offensive abilities."
12/17/2008,"why do you need the extra cargo hold? you have a tractor beam, you can use jetcans.a dedicated salvaging ship shouldn't necessarily be a good looting ship. destroyer equivalent for salvaging, exequror equivalent for looting - what's not to like?"
12/17/2008,blockade runner with extra high slots would unfortunately be way too uber to ever happen
12/17/2008,i like to steal from the wrecks.
12/17/2008,"i can carry a number of large turrets in my destroyer's cargo bay, even with overdrives. do you have a predilection for stealing cap charger 800s?"
12/17/2008,"awesome idea. i currently use an interceptor with three salvagers and a tractor beam. sucks that you can't use the tractor on other people's wrecks, so there needs to be a speed bonus or at least a high base speed with increased salavage chance bonus....as was already mentioned..."
12/17/2008,"meh, i usually drop the caps and metal scraps. my destroyer has a little over 500m3 yet i have to make multiple trips back and forth between the station and the wreck site. it's those large cap batteries, cap transfers, vamps, and all other large sorts that take up all the cargo space. they usually don't sell for more than 100k each, but they do reprocess nicely.strangely enough, nobody ever bothers to pop me when i'm stealing from their wrecks. i'm starting to think people don't love me"
12/17/2008,i'm opposed to a new dedicated salvage ship; if one were introduced there would no longer be any reason to fly a t1 destroyer.
12/17/2008,there isn't now... ...except for a buddy of mine who's off pvping cruisers in his. (somehow he's figured out a damn fit for them - go figure.)
12/17/2008,bump
12/17/2008,nice.
12/17/2008,"buying two of the same 100m isk book isn't funny. especially when it turns out you just bought a second copy of a book that's been sitting in your ship's cargo hold for the 8 jumps it took to get to the market hub where you just bought the new one.not that i've done that myself, of course."
12/17/2008,asset window changes were brought up by inanna last time around.
12/17/2008,"dear etho,part of the democratic process is having quorum. just because a particular pet thread of yours was full of wet towel ""me too"" responses, doesn't mean that you have unanimous support from everyone who cares.the people who didn't respond to those threads might have simply been more enlightened beings than yourself who avoided an obvious troll thread.one's refusal to participate in a lynch mob does not mean that one is abstaining from discussion on a topic.your failure to understand the purpose of the csm does not mean that they should resign for having failed to achieve some goal which you had expected of them."
12/17/2008,"whilst i agree the thread has gone off-topic, to call it an obvious troll thread is doing it a disservice.is the desire to have a public lynching or just an irrelevant troll or what then?what exactly is the role of the csm as far as your concerned? what was the point of them being involved in this at all?"
12/17/2008,"there are several examples of both democratic processes that require quorum and those that don't. for the sake of clarity lets then define what you think should be the case here. both regarding the members' election and their actions.choose one:1) the people who don't participate in a democratic decision are irrevelant.2) the people who don't participate in a democratic decision are revelant.if you chose (1) then what matters here is the number of people who activelly vote for or against a topic and they should be considered as the totality of the voters in the subject. those who abstain won't be considered giving their votes to one side or the other, like you wrongly suggested, but at the end, as the result of their abstinence they would have agreed with the wining side. that is how elections for government representatives work in most of the world.i you chose (2) then both the csm members and all of their motions to this date are illegal, as they don't have suficient quorum to represent even 20% of the potential voters in the game.either way my point remains, they should be disbanded either because they do represent a majority of the active people who asked for disclosure and were denied, and this majority is enough, or because the people who voted on them and who write in these forums are not plentiful enough to decide for the rest.one last note, about your lynch mob example. if you are asked by the lynch mob if they should lynch someone and you say you will abstain from giving your opinion, you are helping the act to take place, and by the law of many countries you can be judged guilty by negligence. if you are against the act, the correct way of showing it is by giving your opinion.edit: and one more thing, you argue that i do not understand the purpose of the csm. you are right on this, i don't, to the point that i think such purpose does not exist. if i am wrong, please, enlighten me with what this purpose would be?"
12/17/2008,"i wasn't sure i wanted to read this thread because i was afraid i knew what kind of posts it would contain. turns out i was right..... who cares who the people are that got banned. they got banned and further information about the exploit is being gathered by ccp. ccp admits they dont have all of the information yet and listed the steps they were taking to try to get the answers to our questions. meaning ccp is going through backup tapes of old game states and data. this isn't something that is going to happen in 1 day or 1 week. i know that pc thingy attached to the typewriter is scary and magical, but even when your it kung-fu is strong, the information doesn't just leap out at you. its something that takes time to find.i know the attention deficit crowd needs the complete information now now now, but out here in what some of us like to call the real world these things take time to do.now, if you'll excuse me, i havn't taken my ritalin for 3 days and have to find the bott.... ohhhh, look at the pretty shiny over there..... and the candy and cake..... did i mention i wanted a pony too? and leave ccp alone ( aka the 'leave britney alone' youtube vid )"
12/17/2008,"i care about who was banned, as should you, considering your alliance has been accused more than once of being involved in this. if you are innocent as you pledge, and i don't doubt that you may as well be, you should be wanting the maximum possible disclosure to prove your innocence beyond all doubt."
12/17/2008,"i'm no fan of the csms, but this isn't an issue they can address or influence. in fact the csms have absolutely no hand in this one way or another. it's incredibly foolish to pin this on them.this is a user privacy policy used by ccp and every other mmo on the market. the players involved in this incident will not be named. anyone with any sense knows this would only cause further drama and backlash ingame. you can either accept that or cry about it.since the thumbs down option hasn't been implemented yet.../thumbsdown"
12/17/2008,"this is true. but then again why exactly do they exist? if they can't do anything to preserve the interests of those they represent they are just figureheads. just a publicity stunt by ccp. on the other hand, there is something they could do if they were true representative of those from whom they received their votes. they could deny ccp of this facade by resigning.wrong. nobody is asking them to name the players, just the characters. the user privacy policy does not apply to the characters, which are ccp's property and no one else's. furthermore ccp has already disclosed information about characters in the past. this is just a lame excuse.just not thumbing up is enough"
12/17/2008,"if you think 95% of the player base wants this, you're dead wrong."
12/17/2008,"how does tons of ""/signed"" responses = we want the character names revealed? in fact in that thread, the 3rd response is a thumbs up who doesn't want names revealed. so your ""95%"" figure is just flat out wrong unless you'd like to give us your tally of all repsonses in that thread and follow up on each poster to clarify what they actually meant.from the first ccp report, they stated that approx. 70 characters were banned and they were only 2 alliances involved. it can safely be said that a lot of the exploiters used npc alts. i would if i were exploiting. so it can safely be said that releasing the names prove nothing. how do you know your buddies don't have an npc alt that was exploiting? you can't prove it. also, one cheater does not implicate an entire corp or alliance. it is only so that people can smack and rabble rouse and yell at each other and we do enough of that already.fact is that revealing names of banned characters or exploiters is opening up a can of worms that ccp can choose to open. csm can ask for ccp to change, but ccp can and should ignore the csm when they come up with dumb ideas.csm is ridiculous in its conception and implementation imo, but if people want to join it, then whatever."
12/17/2008,"i am in full favor of disbanding the useless csm. it's ridiculous to have elected players acting as ""representatives"" when only a very tiny minority voted for them. just who are they representing anyway?nope. do you really want to argue over something so petty as nomenclature? player/character/individual/person, interchangeable words that reference the same thing in context. either name you want to use, the user privacy policy is still the same. ccp will not name the players (characters if you really want) people involved in the incident, no matter how much people try to whine and pick apart the eula. and just because ccp may have named people in the past doesn't mean it was the right choice then nor is it now. naming individuals only causes further drama. it's a situation that has never worked out well in the entire history of mmos. not once. if ccp really did name people in the past, they must've learned from that mistake.sorry bud. no troll fuel for you.(feel free to stomp your feet and toss vulgar insults at me. it still ain't gonna happen)."
12/17/2008,i lol'd in real life.
12/17/2008,"different nomenclatures exist because different things need different words to describe them. players and characters are not the same thing by very very far. unless you trully believe you are cyprus black and fly in spaceships nude surrounded by a weird liquid inside an egg at its center.there is no context that can make these two very different things mean the same, i am sorry. no it is not:- first you inserted this ridiculous italic part in the text trying to prove a point that does not exist. - second there is no such a thing as player's character. the eula clearly specifies that the characters, their assets and anything inside eve are ccp's. they are only leasing them to the players. so if you really think players and characters are the same i am sorry to inform you, but ccp owns you.ccp never named people. they named characters. do you really belive your characters are all real?i am not fond of vulgarities, sorry. but i am quite willing to answer your posts, as there are so many amusing concepts in them."
12/17/2008,"let me set this straight right here. if the only way to get an important point across to ccp is to resign, i will do so despite how much i honor this position the players have elected me to.however, this crap about name and shame is baloney. they will not do that, and i don't blame them for sticking to their guns. you can continue this nerdrage if you want, but i will not. my point is made, and i rest on that."
12/17/2008,"nerdrage? is that what they call legitimate dissent now? excuse us for wanting the truth mr ""elected"" representative.theres the resignation letter anytime you feel the desire to use it."
12/17/2008,"insulting? check.petty bickering? check.delusional rants? check.eula prodding? check.my my, you have all the workings of a forum troll. through all your delusional rantings and confusion over what's real and what's not, you missed the point entirely. it is not the csms responsibility. ccp will not name names. and you're just another whining troll looking for fuel. ain't that a boost to your self esteem."
12/17/2008,nerd rage.sounds extremely right to me.just because you don't get all the names of the players doesn't mean you don't get the truth. it just means that ccp doesn't break their own policy.
12/17/2008,"then it came to this. i can't see it was unexpected, mr alt. as you decided to do your unbiased analysis of my post, i can do no less than return the favor, can i?lets see:premptively insulting -> checkedad hominem fallacies -> checkedwrong eula prodding -> checkedalt character -> checkedignoring arguments and trolling the poster instead -> checkedemorage -> checkedlets see:- you come here to this thread and post a lot of absurdities;- after i debunked those absurdities you try to mend your arguments with a new batch of absurdities, like: ""a char and a player are one and the same"". preemptively calling me a troll for disagreeing with you;- i then easily debunk these arguments once again, and in the lack of any possible answer even remotely reasonable, all that is left to you are ad hominem fallacies;- you start to spill insults and provocations at me ironically calling me a troll;- and to finish you link an urban dictionary entry that could as well define you.my self esteem is very well, by the way. i even post with my main account here. i know you are ashamed of yours, which is very hard on you as you think characters and players are the same, but with the right help you will get better. hopefully...one last advice, repeat to yourself everyday at the morning at least 3 times: ""i am not cyprus black!"". this will help you a lot.how nice, everything our most notable member of the csm has to say here is an ad hominem fallacy. well done.ccp has named characters in several occasions, most notably ""he who should not be named"" (for which they even inserted a filter in these forums). so they break their policies when it is convenient and use them as shield when it is not.as you were so kind of linking your definition of me, i must return you the favor:csm member selection"
12/17/2008,"fantastic, so now you are almost all the community. no, you are 1 player. even supposing that all the characters asking in all the forums for the names are different players (improbable) the request come from some hundred players at most. hardly a ""almost unanimous request"". so please speak for yourself and not for ""the community""."
12/17/2008,he owns 190.000 accounts .
12/17/2008,"etho, who did you vote for?"
12/17/2008,"it has nothing to do with ad hominem. i addressed a specific point where i thought you were inaccurate and then went on to disagreeing with ""idea"" that seem to be, if ccp doesn't tell who did it, they are lying. i think that's totally incorrect."
12/17/2008,"exact numbers please? community consists of accounts, not alt characters like this that can post in forums flaming freely x2 what the original character is not going to do due to his ties. hence, all claims for majority of community demand account verified voting/questioning. not some topic on on forum where you can repost your reworded flame so it seems that more people are rambling about.majority of the community, aka accounts, think this csm-thing is useless, or how else you explain the ""massive"" turnout of 8,61% of eve in latest csm elections? let's read that again, 91,39% of eve was not interested or unavailable to vote for the bunch of people you now claim they want to kick out? i believe csm members can tell you that they agreeded for their personal information to be released when they enter to be nominates for csm. so dont try to pull that string. again numbers, where they come? how many alts included? on both sides to be honest too. have you even bothered calculating the number of thumbs ups on the thread? any backing? let me tell you what's more efficient, why dont you go and cancel your accounts, recycle your characters and show your dissatisfaction to ccp that way. by min it's 15$/ per account or you can be safe, buy timecodes with the isks you get. if the majority of eve community feels like you and follows your lead to the great march, perhaps ccp's eyes will open how right you are in this matter and they cough up the names. that 95% of community is making so much money they're literally forced to do it. after that you can return with all the timecodes and set yourself as eve-o-fora's own mao zedong by fact that you took them to <U+957F><U+5F81>but until you do that, i'm more interested for csm bringing issues like rampant macro-mining and ineffectiveness of petitions and especially towards macro's to ccp's plate then going trough yet another 8.61% csm vote. btw that's not saying this hand should not be seen trough, but like you've said, ccp owns all the cards, and deals them so it's their game and their rules you need to follow if you wish to play."
12/17/2008,"etho,this isn't a call for any of us to make, not the csm, not you, not me, especially considering it will do no good releasing names of characters. the harm has already been done.if you're genuinely interested in helping, provide this thread with a reasonable solution to avoid this from happening in the future. this strongarm mentality that ccp must do what you want and say now isn't helping much either."
12/17/2008,that's easy to say but it will ccp cost a lot of money.hire professional qa people and get rid of those non or semi professionals.better train (junior) gm and let the focus more on quality than quantity (same goes for qa).spend more time communicating with csm and take them more serious.start doing unit testing on all the code thats out there.randomize investigations on players and provide regular reports on the findings.some really controversial stuff.prohibit ccp employees to play the game on tq to avoid the temptation of corruption.make the code publicly available so that everyone can check it for irregularities.
12/17/2008,okay it's been awhile since someone posted something that left me speechless (for longer than 30 seconds)open source eve ftw !!!1!!!!1!!1!!!!
12/17/2008,"fuze,now here's a post worth discussing! unfortunately, i'm heading out the door and to work. but i'll get back to your response, as it is a great post.edit: have some time now :)i like the idea of using professional qa. but i can't comment on their current qa personnel as i know nothing about them. it's certainly something ccp should look into. i'd even suggest ccp incorporate a small roll for the csm in the qa department. maybe as an oversight committee.it seems their coding could use better testing as well. so i agree with you on this.in reference to providing the csm with a more serious role, i agree. however, and in my humble opinion, ccp must have the final say when it comes to decision-making. thus far they've done an excellent job. five years and eve online is still going strong. they definitely deserve credit here. is there room for improvement? most definitely. can the csm play a closer role when it comes to influencing ccp decisions? quite possibly. but this can turn out to be a double-edged sword. i'll expand on this if you would like.in reference to prohibiting ccp employees from playing, well, i'm iffyon this one. i'm sure ccp employees are devout and passionate fans of eve. and in my opinion that is a good thing. it ensures their product is top notch. why ban coca cola makers from drinking coca cola? now it's a different story if they're abusing their status of power (as has already been confirmed in the past for some) for their own personal gain. this is definitely an area which could use some improvement as well.in reference to making the code public, i must confess i'm not much of a coding geek, but couldn't this lead to players exploiting oversighted weaknesses, copyright infringement (from game competitors), and perhaps even modify the code for one's own personal gain? if so, would the benefits outweigh these drawbacks? these are tough decisions that need to be considered before releasing such critical information for everyone to see and possibly manipulate."
12/17/2008,"i almost feel bad for the op and his alt. he's just trying so hard, spinning his wheels, yet not going anywhere. good effort though. like the little train that never had a chance."
12/17/2008,"i don't see how it may be relevant, but if you must know i voted for ankh.and had your restricted your post to this that wold be a lot more civilized and we could discuss about this subject like adults. but instead both of you had to do ad hominem attacks, inadequate to your positions, didn't you?if you check in the official thread about the subject in the information portal, both i and several other people have made suggestions to avoid this from happenign again and to fix the major consequences of what happened this time. especifically the gross of the money and assets that are still out there deforming the game.but that is not the topic of this thread. the point is to discuss if the csm is able to do anything that matters at all. in my opinion it is not. it is simply ignored by ccp regarding important matters. unlike you i have no need to post with alts. :)@tr4d3r4lt- read my posts above for all the answers to your post. i won't repeat myself once again regarding quorum, representativity of the csm and all the other subjects i explained more than once. and above all i won't discuss with an alt. post with your main."
12/17/2008,"actually, i was just interested, i wasn't attacking you. maybe you should talk to the person you elected about your proposal and see if she will sponsor it."
12/17/2008,if we can't get the names of the characters.. then can we get a list of corporations involved?don't tell me ccp privacy policy protects in-game corporations too
12/17/2008,i think its only fair we knew the names of all players that have been banned from the game and for what reasons. we should be able to know who has warnings and how many warnings. that is not a violation of privacy and ccp shouldnt hide it from us. i pay for this game too and i have a right to know. csm should be on this like white on rice.
12/17/2008,"the csm was created to give an impression that the players had say about the outcome of this game, the biggest issues we have about game play will never change the mind of the programmers artists, producers, and designers of ccp they seem to be drunken idiots for what i have come to see this past 3+ years. the people who created eve are not working on it, they are working on world of darkness this is single biggest reason for all the bad decisions this past year, second being the merger of white wolf that increased the size not the quality of ccp as an operating group.the only good thing about the csm is that the player base can watch as issue after issue are ignored even when the cases are presented in a well organized manor, so i wouldn't quit or support quitting, as the csm allows players that care enough to pay attention that they aren't going to get anything they want that actually costs ccp money or effort that isn't already planned, which will give them a better educated choice of why they are paying to play eve in the first place or accept that it is a declining pile that it has become this last 2 months.the csm is a giant trough of hopeful wanna be game makers that spew out ideas until one actually fits something that is already planned by ccp. i do not know how to make this any clearer then this simple statement. go speak with the guys at ccp in person someday."
12/17/2008,i gotta ask.... if you people really hate it that much... then why are you still paying them money?
12/17/2008,"i am not paying them, they gave me a 5 day free pass after i canceled all my accounts. i came to this forum to find some hope that they might be listening the customers, and give me a reason to restart my accounts, but so far no good news yet."
12/17/2008,"a ""5 day free pass""yeah.... right....t.t"
12/17/2008,"i am not lying this is what i received from ccp a few hours ago, so its the only reason i am here. enjoy being wrong. :-) this was wrapped along with a picture of my character, and some other promo art. i am happy they gave it to me, it is a nice xmas gift from ccp to be able to speak to fellow eve players such as yourself, and what i consider the brain trust of all game communities.greetings xxxxmore and more players have been returning to eve online, and here's your chance to get in game and see why. for a limited time we are offering a free five-day pass to inactive eve online accounts. your character is just as you left it, with your entire arsenal and inventory intact, awaiting your return. the leaps in performance offered by stacklessio and eve64 have raised the bar for congregation and combat across the universe. stop by jita and see what everyone is up to. collect your new certificates and see what others you can work towards."
12/17/2008,"neither ccp nor eve are democracies. one is a corporation and the other is a registered trademark. the fact ccp allow for some democratically elected representatives of the community to speak for the community is rare and novel. beyond that the csm have no source of legislative power, can enact no binding laws and have no ability to enforce their will (and neither can the player base incidently - thank god for that).this ridiculous proposal definitely does not get my support. oh... and etho, grow up a little before you start espousing the virtues of the democratic process. dress it up how you like but you can't hide what you are."
12/17/2008,"so you are saying that the csm has no real power besides being a figurehead council right? just like i said. maybe you should read the thread before replying...anyways, if the csm has no power and neither eve nor ccp are even remotely like a democracy, then there is no motive for the csm to even exist, besides being a publicity stunt for ccp and an insult to the players intelligence.you are attacking me, without any reasonable argument to support this attack at all, because you dislike my opinions. that is about as mature as a 4 year old child throwing a tantrum. but yes, i promise that i will mirror myself in your maturity example here and grow up."
12/17/2008,the only thing i'm going to enjoy is the silence of yet an another griper in the next 5 days or less.being wrong is minor in light of that.
12/17/2008,"that's kind of like, if you hate george bush government, why are you still living in usa and not move to canada or something?i do believe that the current devs in charge of game balance and new features are like bush of usa. we want change. we used to have good devs, so i know this is possible. we need to replace current devs in those key positions. i don't have much faith that the current people can get ""better"""
12/17/2008,lol. i really don't think this is far from the truth tbh.ccp can give an air of transparency on this by answering all the questions... who's to say they are the real answers?
12/17/2008,to quote 8z 6 in the ghost training thread: who says we pay?
12/17/2008,"highlighted the part that's wrong.how is knowing the player names going to accomplish anything? spend 5 minutes searching well known third party forums and i'm sure you can find some player names, corp names and alliance names. furthermore, even if you did find out those player names, does it change anything? they will already be banned. or is it some self-satisfying desire to create stupid threads so people pay attention to you?"
12/17/2008,"what he's saying... etho ""crybaby""is ccp can do whatever the hell it wants when it wants.if you don't like it... pack your bags and leave.the csm's purpose is to deliver information to ccp.whether that information is accepted.... and or used.... is entirely up to them.the csm has no real power in the sense you want it to be.out of the 30 to 40,000 some odd players.... the small number of people in the csm are a nice way to filter out the crap from the good.that's why its a elected body of players..... to represent the player base.they may have agendas.... ideas....and such... but all they get is face time with ccp...and a chance to talk...whether ccp want's to listen or not....act...or not act.... or say no comment...or say no period.. is bloody well up to them.the power they do have is the ability to contact ccp more easily and more efficiently than we can.ccp grants the csm a bit more attention in the grand scheme of things then they would you because the csm has been designated with that job.so get it through your thick skull and understand that.or stfu.because you of all people are the most foolish one of them all if you can't get that figured out.asking csm to resign is a waste of time and accomplishes nothing. no one gains anything out of it and your just making there jobs worse.if anything you should close your account and go to wow... there you'll get your so called freedom to do as you please.in reality it won't matter if someone is politely pointing out that your wrong... or loudly calling you a total *******.because you wont hear anyone.... you just hear yourself talking all the time.all your doing is pushing for the csm to be disbanded for no reason other then the coincidence of the situation involving the exploit of the pos's.and that is far more childish then anything ive seen yet.the csm knows what they are getting into... after all they waste many many hours to bother to do there job on behalf of all of us... as opposed to sitting there throwing a damned fit and crying like some baby without his bottle.i may not have gotten the one i voted for... but at least they are doing there best to make eve better for all of us.everyone these days always has these astronomically high expectations.people need to learn to be thankful for what little they have... and stop being so damned greedy for once.the csm may have a term where they get very little done...... but there will be a term that will have much done....i'm thankful for what little we do get...you however... are nothing more than a selfish pompous jerk.so when your told to grow up.... i suggest you take it at face value."
12/17/2008,eve is a game you idiot.... not a country.stop comparing oranges to apples.if you don't like the game you go get another one like every other human being in this world.stop comparing real life to a game of internet ships.
12/17/2008,someone pays for the account you use at some point or another.whether it be money..... or time spent getting iskies.either way... the point is still very much valid.
12/17/2008,"i didn't say it had no role, just no real power. it's role is quite well defined and reasonably useful.see above... power and utility are not always the same. petulant and feisty little pup aren't you . i think you've attacked just about everyone who's disagreed with you. hmm... somewhere between,ferrous cranus andenfant provocateur"
12/17/2008,"really? wow. well that's a newflash. we still don't all pay though. has it ever occured to you that people can still like the game enough to play (and to effectively play for free through playing) yet not like the way it's run, some of the changes and/or the scandals? no, it really isn't."
12/17/2008,quoted for truth. i would love to see an actual browser in game.
12/17/2008,we raised this in iceland <U+FFFD> year ago.
12/17/2008,"not specifically - you raised my forum thread, which included an offhand mention of the igb's problems. ccp's response was that the igb was being replaced in the future, which is quite good, but i suppose i want them to hurry up. no igb-specific thread has been introduced, so adding one might show a bit of urgency. alternately, do you plan to ask for a status update on all the issues from last time around at one of these meetings? that might fulfill the same purpose."
12/17/2008,i think there are much more important things to do. developing a new browser would require much resources i guess?
12/17/2008,as in liberating passersby of their belongings...
12/17/2008,"skunk. you are a dee-de-de. stop thinking. your making us all look bad.how about this? player logs in. player hits the ""play for me"" button. game plays itself. or would you just be satisfied with the gm option bar @ the top of your screen? liberate your brain from your butt and leave the 'thinking' to the people who do it best.cheers pirate."
12/17/2008,i don't think you 'get' le skunk.
12/17/2008,"i have to agree with le skunkthe latest boost to transports was totally over the top. transports were already extremely tough to catch. they could use mwd+cloak warp trick. i dunno what ccp is thinking, but it looks like a lot of people here think the same thing. it's sad to see this game go mainstream, more like wow with every patch.i guess that always happens when games become popular.maybe it's time to start a no-pvp server?"
12/17/2008,waaa they took away my jamwaaa they took away my speedwaaa they took away my noswaaa they took away my speed againwaaa they took away my ability to catch blockade runners.uh..they gave you h-dictorsi get him. i also have seen him in game. he is complaining that he cannot 'splode blockade runners. another ship off his list of targets..and the pirate is whining on the forums about it. skunk flys an hictor and a bs. if he cant catch them..then he isnt the pirate i thought he was. you scout the other side..you see it coming... its a joke when you see a pirate without his blankie. basically he is whining cause its harder to do something he used to do w/o thinking. and so are the rest of you. someone give the baby a t2 win button already. ps - i can pop a blockade runner with a cloak in an onyx. fix the leak in your face and move along. the rest of you too. change happens. adapt or pop.
12/17/2008,"are you going to be satisfied when they make it **easier** for you to shoot them? you are arguing the point of both sides and dont even realize it. change keeps the game fresh. you could just as easily have been on the other end of the stick complaining that you 'couldnt get ur goods across lowsec' or whatever. i derive satisfaction from killing a harpy with my drake solo. i get excited over a kill only if its challanging. i dont get excited when my af tears down an unmanned nub ship. ccp presents you with a bit of challange, and you serve it up in the forums. it sounds to me like you want this to be wow. where every ones the same color and we are all born with equal rights and 1 ship setup pownes all and whine whine whine whine whine. skunk _ if you target them in your setup on your phobos _ you can catch them all day long. but you dont want to do that..cause it would mean loosing that setup you are so fond of. its the reason you posted. you dont want to 'adapt' your setup. i *used* to think like yall...till i realized how much of a tard i was actually being.and for the love of eve...stop compairing this game to wow."
12/17/2008,"i carried my goods past le skunk in low-sec system many times, usually in a battleship. a couple times i lost a battleship, but it wasn't a big deal, didn't carry anything expensive.change is good to have, but i am concerned about the pattern of changes we are seeing. the game is becoming less hardcore and more like wow."
12/17/2008,"if you have the starbase password, you should at least have input-only rights to the jump bridges to refuel them.when you're in a group of alliances, like we are in the gbc, it's often annoying to delay or postpone ops because bridges are out of fuel and you can't refuel them. it'd make sense to carry some fuel with you to top off any bridges you use or are already out of fuel."
12/17/2008,supported!
12/17/2008,a pos is an alliance asset not a global asset.
12/17/2008,the game has these things called stargates. i hear they work for getting around.
12/17/2008,it's called planning. make sure you top off the jbs before a big op. if you cannot have a single member of an alliance with jb refueling roles online during a major moving operation then your alliance sucks.
12/17/2008,"hi,as a faction wafare participant from day one, i miss the large daily fleetfights which we had in the first weeks and months after launch of fw. when fw was introduced, the devs mentioned that it's not the final version, and that more things will come, they even created threads where people ought to post their ideas on rewards etc.many proposals have been made since then, there were countless good ideas on concepts on the forums, yet i don't see any official announcements or hints from ccp, that they are still working on fw. i watched all the videos from fanfest, read all the devblogs and q&as and didn't find any fw-related info. the purpose of this thread is to bring fw into the attention of csm, so that it (hopefully) can be subject in one of the next meetings. i hope people will support this concern and ccp finally introduces (or at least announces) a content injection for fw which is geared for inducing more activity in the whole area (or connect the 2 fw areas for an instant increase of targets for all), so that we can have our daily epic fleetfights again."
12/17/2008,"i support this, but unfortunately you have to get in line behind 0.0 warfare, pos re-working, sov re-working, low sec improvements, tech 3, walking in stations and god knows what else.i expect great things from fw but don't hold yer breath :)"
12/17/2008,"as a pilot who is currently involved in fw, i can assure you that it is on my list of things to do - i have a collection of ideas for fw. the limiting factor is writing them up."
12/17/2008,"fw is terrible.high end fw plexes/compounds/strongholds need webbing towers to stop them being solod/kited by a single rifter/inty.the final stronghold that activates when a system can be ""conquered"" should be replaced with a static and scaled down starbase to act as a simulation of pos warfare, as fw was partially designed to get people prepped for life in 0.0. also would allow low sec cap pilots to have some big fun and risk some expensive ships.and would also allow ""safe"" muster points in your own faction's systems.more work needed.more love needed."
12/17/2008,"already discussed at fanfest and will already be discussed in january, again.wiki entry on this issue"
12/17/2008,"jah'ret khan, some nice suggestions there. even though this subject has been brought up multiple times already, it's always nice to hear new perspectives."
12/17/2008,simply asking for ccp to fix fw or inject more content into it probably isn't achieve to get much without something more concrete.
12/17/2008,"@iudex""as a faction wafare participant from day one, i miss the large daily fleetfights which we had in the first weeks and months after launch of fw.""thats not a problem of fw or ccp. at day one plenty of pilots wanted to try fw. they did so and left.""wh"

12/17/2008,see? this is the perfect example of why we need a thumbs down option.
12/17/2008,"i have no idea what you're talking about, but it sounds like you're going out of your way to screw someone who isn't hurting you.so **** you."
12/17/2008,"you need to spend about 3 months to train each character and build up standing. so after 9 months you will have 5 r&d agents on each character (the fifth is another 25 days of training for character, so no training that without ghost training). each character will produce approximately 10 datacores every day that you can sell for 300k each (rough averages). so 9 millions day for account. 270 millions in 1 month, 540 millions in 2 months. essentially every 66 of datacore gathering you can pay 1 gtc. so reactivating the account once year can gather 3.200.000.000 and spend 600.000.000. honestly, seeing at it require 9 month of paid account and work to get it started, hardly worth it. (ah, about 200 millions of implants and skillbooks for each character too)"
12/17/2008,"something as simple as making sure that the program responsible for putting a reaction product in the output of a reactor is also responsible for loading the next reactants into the reactor, and only generating the reaction product when reactants are available.it's something like two-column accounting. you have one process responsible for emptying the product from a reactor into the silo. you have another process that reacts the reactants together and turns them into product. then another process draws more reactants from the connected silos/couplings.empty the reactor, then perform the reaction, then load the reactants. if there are not enough reactants available, the reactor is stopped, with a message posted to the corporation telling them the supplies have run out. along the way, record the consumption and production totals for the reactor.the balance side of the equation is this: at maintenance time, make a record of the various reactions that are configured in running reactors. compare that to the consumption/production totals for all the reactors. if the consumption/production is out of proportion to the expected results of the configured reactors, start looking at why.people don't just go changing reactors around every few hours. usually there's messing about with the p.o.s pos ui to get the reaction set up properly, then the pos is left alone except for adding supplies, ammo and fuel, and removing product.the same thing would apply to manufacturing lines, blueprint copies, researching, etc. on one hand, you only produce the output in the same process that ensures the inputs are there (ensuring the inputs are destroyed if it's that type of process). on the other hand you monitor the total consumption and creation and compare that against the total configured processes.are more blueprint copies in existence than can be explained by the total blueprint copying processes that have been run today?is more ferrogel come into existence than can be explained by the total number of active reactors?i tentatively agree that multiple processes to get the same product might be a feasible means of gauging if another exploit has been discovered, but that is only going to work if the demand for materials and ownership of productive moons remains stable for longer than twice the full material cycle.if the critical path from dysprosium -> ishtar is one month (mining the dysprosium, reacting the ferrogel or whatever, building the component parts, then building the ishtar), you'd need demand for the components and ownership of the moons to be stable for at least two months to see any stability in the system.in general, any process that involves the conversion of some thing to some other thing must be audited by having a record of the instances and iterations of that process (setting up a copying run, loading a reaction into a reactor), as well as a separate record of the consumption and production of materials used by that process (every time a blueprint copy is created, every time a reaction product is created, every time tritanium is consumed to produce a scourge missile). you might be able to get away with recording the iterations of a production run, if there is a guarantee that the process of running that iteration consumes the required resources or fails to produce anything.talk to a bank about financial software :) you never add money to one account without guaranteeing that it's removed from some other account first."
12/17/2008,"sharding would only give you a level playing field for your first play session.after that, someone else will have more hours per week to put into farming up the resources to advance their character faster than yours. they'd have the +5 implants while you're still pottering around with +3. they'd have the faction battleship before you, because they've been out mining, mission-running, buying the nexus chips, yadda yadda.i hear this argument all the time in wow: ""i want to start again because all these other people in the established guilds have it easy."" the new servers get filled up with idiots who are all too busy trying to be ""first"" to something, so none of them want to cooperate because cooperation might mean not being in control. the old servers die slow, lingering deaths. it's not good for anyone.set your own goals. measure your progress against your own abilities. be satisfied with completing your projects and achieving your own goals.eve is the game that you make it. if you're not happy, the problem is not with the game."
12/17/2008,i support this idea. think the map there could be more useful but at the very least being able to separate the useful parts out would suffice for now.
12/17/2008,powergaming? in my eve?
12/17/2008,"i've spent a year specialising in flying a drake for mission-running.now i've found that it's more fun flying a dominix. if i'd known that before i started specialist training in heavy missiles and the respective support skills, i wouldn't have bothered with the drake.even if the option of respending skill points was available as a once-off for any character or any account, i'd be able to change my character to play the way i have found that is fun.yes, i could just go train to fly a dominix, but to get the same level of sp investment as i have in my drake would take another year. gallente spaceships training, hybrid weapon training, gunnery support skills - they're entirely different skill sets to what i originally trained for.i don't regret training to fly the drake. i certainly do enjoy flying the dominix much more. this character can't even start training for gallente battleships, but at least she can use small hybrid weapons. gotta start somewhere!"
12/17/2008,i don't want a ****ing summary.
12/17/2008,it's not even a real issue and shame on any csm for wasting ccps time with this nonsense.
12/17/2008,"in bunyip's defense, his post was made back before he was elected as csm, and i do not believe that it is part of his current platform.otherwise, you are absolutely correct. there are many, many more important issues that need to be looked at, and salvage aggro is not an issue.working as intended."
12/17/2008,the only ones that would suffer if stealing salvage became a criminal act is mission runners.
12/17/2008,for us a war-dec is a serious political action brought about by a desire for real-life friction in the csm.
12/17/2008,"the idea i plan to bring up had a lot of support, but few actually checked the thumbs up button in the list. the idea is as follows:ore distribution"
12/17/2008,we already raised that during last csm.
12/17/2008,well the ideas i wanted to bring up included:add 'view contracts':
12/17/2008,there's a fine line between bad behavior and roleplaying. those who try to blur that line already know damn well where that line is and are just looking for excuses for their behavior.

12/17/2008,"i'm confused then - if the response was that it's allowed, why is your comment ""exploit is still open""?"
12/17/2008,the theft of mission objectives stuff isnt the exploit petition. it's the petition i made after the exploit petition. i'm obviously not going to share the details of that petition.oh and i finally got a response from that exploit petition... but honestly... ccp says they respond in less then 1 day but they really dont. 4 days to respond...on a side note... i'm not happy with the answer to the exploit petition. i'm going to have to figure out where this gm stands. quite sure he isnt a lead gm.

12/18/2008,"you guys just dont get it do you? you cant defend it because when vultures steal they arent flagged to you. they are flagged to the guys you just killed... that arent there anyways, or i wouldnt be worring about loot cause i'd still have war targets shooting me. our option would to be to get concorded trying to kill them ?? they risk nothing, thats the problem. ccp needs to regognize the war targets loot is mine, not the first person to get to (unles his flashy red ass can get away from me)."

12/18/2008,"ever been disconnected and have drones out?mostly happens when i'm in a bs and they are about 50k away.the only thing you can do to regain control over them is crawl 50k and scoop them back to your drone bay.not exacly fun.i propose a skill to re-establish control over disabled drones.this would be limited to drones that are a) disabled, b) belong to your corp.might be even possible to 'recruit' drones from a 'fallen' corp member in battle? something like having to target the drone, and (new button) initiating communication protocol to (re)gain control.levels could perhaps increase the distance to how far, or how fast, you'd be able to do this. or what type of drones, level 1 = light scouts, 2 medium, etc. etc.what do you think?"
12/18/2008,"i'd be much happier, if this would work without any skills or modules.make it take a bit of time. 10 seconds per drone, for example. that should deal with most exploitations. i'm really sick of picking up my drones manually, every time the connection has a glitch and warps me out while i log back in. it is bad enough that my beloved drones get torn to shreds while i'm out, but having to pick them up all piece by piece is stupid.if disabled drones could at least be tractored in..."

12/18/2008,isn't this what you pay for. skill training is the only long term time related event in eve. hence if you are not training you are not getting what you paid for. on the other hand ccp make money out of people who forget to update their training whilst on holiday etc. so they will be very reluctant to do it.i fully support a training queue of about 5 skills.
12/18/2008,"so many people have been asking for this for a long time. now that ghost training is disabled there is no reason not to have it.to the rant claiming we are not intelligent enough to plan our own skills and we just you evemon, stfu. seriously the world runs on efficency and ease of use. not everyone has time to monitor their skills or maybe things come up and you cant get onto the game. if we are paying what is the problem? no, i am not incapable of setting a long skill, but i could save myself a lot of time on a specific path if i just had a one or two skill queue!"
12/18/2008,"i support this, even if it just allows you to queue 1 more skill, or automatically starts training the next level in the current skill, anything is better than the current system."

12/18/2008,"i support this idea, but would like it taken further. there should be new ships introduced, preferably t2 destroyers or cruisers, designed specifically for salvaging/hacking/archaeology. these ships should have a good set of high and mid slots, and a decent tank, but very limited combat capabilities. think salvaging-hac, with chance bonuses to all analyser modules, and tractor beam range bonuses, along with standard t2 resists and a repper bonus. they should probably be based off the mining cruiser hull.this would be a good design for one i think (gallente armour tanker):highs: 6meds: 5lows: 5turrets: 3missiles: 1bonuses:t1: 5% bonus to armour repairer amount per levelt1: 10% reduction in fitting requirements of all analyser and tractor beam modules per levelt2: 10% bonus to tractor beam range per levelt2: 15% bonus to chance of success on analyser modules per levelthe fitting bonus could be replaced by an afterburner speed boost bonus.note: this probably isn't balanced, but it gives you an idea"

12/18/2008,"no two things in this universe are the same. that is why i personally dislike analogies. but things do have similarities and people tend to use analogies to put these similarities into focus.no, leaving your country is not the same as living a game and none of them is the same of leaving a person you love, for example. but all three share some smilarities, one of them being that you are giving up of something. now, you may be doing it because you don't stand the country in question, or the game in question. and if that is so, that is what you should do. but if you are doing this, despite still liking it, just because there are things in it that bother you without even putting a fight to change them, you are making a mistake.people invest lots of tim in this game, and it is natural that they get attached to what they conquer here, virtual as it may be."
12/18/2008,"you admit that your numbers are not based on actual majority of player but in majority csm part of forum reading player base, making your op moot in it's message. try to drive your proposition with proper numbers, saying 200 posters demanded instead of 95% of player population would change your post from without basis claim to matter that actually has some support.then you directly reply to me that you wont discuss with an alt. this creation of own rule i dont understand. the forums where you base your figures of support allow alt posting. hence i'm neither breaking or falling outside of the rules for participating that you've yourself created in this topic.claiming that you wont discuss this topic with alt, but instead demand main shows that you in fact care for the account's main instead of alts that the account has. taking this further how can you, if account's main is important, say that you still base your claims in op to a figure you got from a forum topic where alt posting *is* allowed and you have no way of confirming who is posting with multiple alts and who is not? looking at how against you're my alt post, i must assume you've done deep research on the topic in question and have found after it that the number of x (number of thumbs) - y (number of alt thumbs) is 95% of the total participants in the thread. as you've done this research, it should not be hard to release the true numbers as that would be the backing you need to bring this matter to ccp's eyes. if you have no reason to tell difference between alt's support and main's support, why wont you discuss the matter and the details it's based with me?feel free to correct where i've mistaken your intentions as with proper presentation and actions it still could make good first case."
12/18/2008,"naming and shaming automatically creates guilty by association. after t20, people automatically assumed that everyone in bob was a liar and cheater, even though the people involved (and even knew about it) could be counted on one hand. only the guilty ones should be punished, not the people who had no idea this was going on and were only innocent bystanders. that's why they don't name and shame.and while i rarely agree with an alt, this one has a very good point. i'd summarize it, but if you (the op and everyone who agrees with him) can't be bothered to read this properly i would have to call into question your rather contradictory logic."
12/18/2008,"about the representativity of the portion of the player base that has active interest in the matter, i won't explain what i have already explained. read my posts in this threads for your answers. if you still can't understand means you either are not capable of or don't want to. in either case it is a waste of my time to continue arguing with you about it. about my figures. there are more than 95% of the posters calling for transparency. transparency, if you didn't realize yet, means full access to the information regarding the matter. anything that is kept hidden means there is no transparency by definition, only obfuscation. go to the thread about transparency and count those that are vowing for it. then get back here if your figures are different from mine. keep in mind i did my figures some days ago, when i started the thread, though.in your previous message, it was clear you hadn't read anything but the first post in the thread. in this last one at least yu give indications of having read my previous answer to you as well. maybe we will be able to have a reasonable conversation when you read more of it. alts are used to flame, to troll and to do everything the main account is too ashamed to admit doing. therefore, discussing with alts is more often than not a huge waste of time. your previous post seemed to confirm that. this one is much better though and deserved an answer.ignorance is always more damaging than knowledge. knowledge allows you to check the coherence of statements in order to disprove lies and to confirm truths. the more information you have the more difficult it gets for you to be fooled.on the other hand, in the absence of such information, the gap is filled with imagination, and any half-truth that can be partially confirmed becomes the accepted truth.only through information can the innocent that are already blamed by association (and i am sure there are many of them) can clear themselves from the stain."
12/18/2008,"here you acknowledge you're talking about posters. let's keep that in mind for later. then you talk about ccp needing to give full transparency on names and details. valid claims, however you fail on transparency yourself as you're unable to provide the numbers you have backing you up on this. remember, it's your duty to present the facts, just like you demand from ccp, not mine to go dig it should i disagree. the op as a post is misleading. when interested community members question you for facts, shooing them off gives message how caring for transparency you are. discussing with alts, but not calculating them into the numbers of supporters? so alt is fine as long as it gives thumbs, but bad when it disagrees?are the following possible flames, trolls or suggestions that main account is too ashamed to admit of doing? what's your opinion and were it taken in to calculation in your figures that still haven't been given. all are directly from the first 10 pages of that thread.along with long list of;did you take these to your numbers? how many of these thumbs have been made with alts? ccp knows and while 992 thumbs might look like lot, when it's put trough alt check, the number wont come out as 992. however you were speaking of posters, hence we will count posts until you provide the exact numbers of individual alts posting. remember, it's your job to bring evidence, to back your claims, not mine.we need to crunch with estimate numbers, the thread has 1303 replies and 992 thumbs. you made this thread, 2008.12.15 22:26:00 exactly at the same time then post number 1261 in that thread then you edited your post couple minutes later, obviously correcting the numbers to be exact match.after that, there has been aprox 10 thumbs on the thread and 42 posts, bringing us to 1261 posts and 982 thumbs. 95% of 1261 is 1198. so even without going into the possible alt-posts to manipulate the results to up or down, it still comes out wrong. if you had said 77.87% backing or would release the numbers now, you would have case. but honestly, i doubt you have the numbers.i believe, that you saw a trend and decided to try to ride the wave. by not taking into account how meaningless the system that's only meant to raise topics to csm attention is for determining what majority feels you've spoiled what could have been proper opposition claim to buckle cabinet. you've been left on the shore soaking wet after the big wave went and some nameless stranger is laughing at your failure from the cliff above. that's the reason why i'm against alt posting in this part of forum and also why i'm against of releasing the names of exploiters. they'll end up in the same shore while the nameless masses point and laugh. it's good being nameless but not so good for the cheat."

12/18/2008,"if there is one thing in this world that really disgusts me is people who continously argue and point fingers till they are black and blue in the face and only really make themselves look silly when it comes to having the right to access information about things that dont neccessarily really concern them. the players that ccp banned have got their punishment, no doubt ccp will be attending to corps and alliances that indirectly or without knowledge of it have been affected by the exploit. guilt by associatation, thats actually a petty thing to go after people who had no knowledge but yet have been caught up in it. basically for some reason you feel the knowledge of people who are already affected will empower you some how, or is it because you want to laugh in their face.eve is not a democracy, nor do you really have any right to information which doesnt belong to you. asking the csm to resign on an issue is quite pointless and without merrit, as you are basically holding them resposible for you not getting information that you wanted, that is not their job"
12/18/2008,clarify what exactly what is there job??
12/18/2008,"ignorance is no defense. i understand that you are one of the small minority that were unable to make the leap from the original concept of the csm to it's actual implimentation.but really, no matter how well you think your arguing your case, dosn't the fact you have no demonstratable support, beyond one or two others, tell you anything.i admire people who stick to their principles, i truely do, but when they constantly shout about how they are sticking to their principles and demand that others follow their lead, irregardless of the percieved rights or wrongs of their argument, i frankly wanna go out and buy ear plugs.i think we'd all respect you a little bit more if you actually fought a battle you even had the slimest chance of winning."
12/18/2008,"your numbers are wrong. you may have not computed those that stated support and didn't check the thumbs up item, and you may as well have counted more than one post of the same person. but regardless, even if you were right even 77% is still the majority by far.except for the calculations, you are repeating yourself once again, and i already answered to your previous posts. when you have something new to say please let me know.history is full of vocal minorites that at some point or another became majority. the number of angry people that posted in this thread trying everything to discredit it, many of them trying to pretend they don't care while posting multiple times, shows how worried they are about it. elric and a considerable number of others support my views, they may not be the majority in this thread yet, but, as csm continues to be the useless figurehead council it is, things may change."
12/18/2008,"history is written by the victors, for every sucessful vocal minority there will have been/ have been a thousand who were the victors.as for your use of the world considerable, that is sheer poetic liecense on your part. a more accurate description of your level of support is negligable.but then again that's the point, this isn't an argument about facts, figures and substance, this is purely an argument about perception and your continued attempts to 'round up to the next level' your level of support says more about your perception of your agrument than anything anyone else can say."
12/18/2008,"wow, the op and his alt must really want this list of names. a list that is inherently troll fuel.sorry, no troll fuel for you. one hundred and twenty six responses yet only eleven supports? take the hint and move on."
12/18/2008,"well, i happen to disagree. the number of disgruntled people like you in this thread is not hugely superior to the number of people that supported me. you just happen to post more because you are afraid of something, it seems.and even if you were right, if i am not bothered by my position why should you? do you care for me so much that you want to protect me from rejection? that is touching, but really, you can use your time for more productive tasks.on the other hand, if you want to discuss about the topic of this thread instead of my popularity, i am more than happy to oblige."
12/18/2008,"if i am correct, you object to the csm being a figurehead and nothing more?ccp doesn't have to have a csm, but they did it. sorry it doesn't live up to your oh, so high, expectations.as for naming and shaming those involved? ccp has said they won't, and they have said their dealing with it.you can either trust them to do their job or not. but if not, there is a very simple answer for you. leave.yes, i'm familiar with t20, and all that other ****. my point still stands."
12/18/2008,"yes, they can be. ccp is a business, and as such can pretty much do whatever they want with their virtual stuff. vov which they are under no obligation to do, at all, by any stretch of the imagination. if you don't like their answer..... --------------->|door they gave as much information as they were willing to give. matters not how may people request/demand to know ... and they gave the answer they wanted to give.. you are not entitled to anything more than what they are willing to give you... regardless of any other input...ummmm, internal affairs was created @ ccp - you didn't hear? csm was created for a different purpose. sorry that is so much beyond you."
12/18/2008,"you are incorect. i object to the csm existence if it is only a figurehead. it is against the player's interests to have a figure head council. it only serves to ccp own interests as a pr stunt.sorry, but you are late. love it or leave it is a fallacy. if you want to know why read my posts above. it is highly adviseable to read what a person wrote before you start to argue with him about it... internal affairs are a damage control tool. you can't trust an institution to police itself. and such purpose would be? i am really curious about your answer..."
12/18/2008,op exaggerates and has silly overblown expectations that lead to frustration when not fullfilled.no.
12/18/2008,"this exploit was a player exploit, obviously you cant trust players to police themselves either. csm was created to be a part of the interface between players and ccp and to bring player ideas and concerns to ccp, this does not mean that they were given oversight on ccp decisions. ccp has every right to decide what information to give out, and although we pay a monthly subscription fee to use their services, we are not shareholders of ccp. no matter how much you want to believe that you have a right to the information, customers in most situations dont get information like you are asking for.as for giving out full information on the exploit, to what end, so that other players have more information to try and find another exploit along the same lines."
12/18/2008,"players are not an uniform group. among players there are several groups with diametrally opposed interests, making them ideal to find irregularities, because those irregularities will be always against at least the interests of one of those groups.ccp is a company, an uniform group, it has one and only one interest, maximize its profits. and in the absence of pressure against it damage control is the optimum way to do it.if is very unlikely that there is another exploit along the same lines. if there is it shows negligence from ccp, because they just fixed pos bugs and should have made sure that at least duping was impossible now. furthermore, the more people that know about an exploit the harder it is for it to stay secret."
12/18/2008,"the browser is integrated deep in the eve client. it's used for rending all sorts of things, including eg. mission description screens, item info boxes et. al.so yes, it's a big thing to replace, but it is important."
12/18/2008,"ccp releases monthly subscription statistics or at least quarterly report included in the earnings statements.eve detail:1) total number of accounts.2) number of active subscriptions.3) number of in-active subscriptions.4) type of payment methods including credit card, gtc, pay pal any other payment options.5) total number of banned accounts.6) total number of suspended accounts due to eula or another standard reason for suspension.7) overhead costs broken down by department, location or territory.8) account duration numbers of active days left per active accounthealth of eve and ccp should concern any dedicated player of this game."
12/18/2008,sounds like something the competition would like to really know
12/18/2008,"well, i respect your opinion. but im still training for one. i dont hear skunk complaining that he now has the ability to dissolve the warp drive of any passing ship. i am not complaining about it. we are too busy tearing apart this boost. ccp took away warp stabs by giving pirates the h-dictor (and we all know we freakin use it). ccp boosts 1 ship type to counter 'blockade' efforts. seems like a trade off to me.i finally have a reason to train industrial on my pvp toon. ccp give'th, ccp take'th away."
12/18/2008,"hahahahahahaaaa!!!!being a goon i use the goon forums and have seen some of the worst posting known to mankind.but the op has set a new level to which crap-posting must aspire.your suggestion is terrible and without a single redeeming feature.you have created smething with no merit.i salute you!why not go one further and suggest having your wallet increase as your skill points incease every second?why not go one further and mash your face into the keyboard repeatedly and then click ""post reply"", as that may be the only way you could come up with a less productive suggestion.thank you for posting, i will giggle myself to sleep tonight..."

12/18/2008,actualy that hase already been sugestedand yes blokade runers got a huge boost in this last pach....if u arent verry verry verry luky u cant cach them in lowsec ... why? well simple...to tank the gates u need a hac or biger...that meens slower ship and slower targeting...now to uncloak them u need to get to them in less then 5 sec...that is a aprox speed of 2km/s...that is not counting that u need to accelerate..target and point them...wich makes these ships well...realisicly speeking imposible to catch in lowsec if used corecly...u can catch them ether by:- being originaly close to them- having tons of luck to get a object next to them so they dont cloak- war dec them so u can use small fast shipsnow in 0.0 it is a diferent discusion as u have hics/dictors and bubles..but there still preaty hard to getp.s. no im not a pirate so dont even try to flame me for that...just call it as i see it

12/18/2008,who's laughing?this forum is serius biznes!!!
12/18/2008,"ok, i do feel they need a boost but you have gone way overboard.an actual boost would be:give transport ships a bonus to decreased signature radius. also give then a resistance to warp jamming/ interdiction. this would make it so the blockade would have to be well rounded and thought out."

12/18/2008,"i would support it if fuel costs were increase 20x times.jump bridges are everywhere now, they make 0.0 too safe and easy, and they discourage small scale pvp. tho i won't argue they are great for big blob wars, as they allow near-instant blob travel from anywhere to anywhere"
12/18/2008,uh last i checked they are corp asset not alliance asset :)and yeah its a pain to whait for a particular corp to fuel there jb but that is haw this works...afterall jb ware actualy made for alliance only use ;) (that is why u need to control the space befor u drop the jb...simply put coalitions are not recognised and/or helped by the game mecanincs...be happy that gangs can be formed from mixed alliances)

12/18/2008,fw is a bit underwhelming. /supported
12/18/2008,yes make better please..
12/18/2008,"thanks for the support so far !you are right, seems like the favourite customer base for ccp are the 0.0 alliance guys, but i think since the mechanics are already there (e.g. the missions with ship restrictions, statistics, combat mechanics), it should require only little work for a good result. only a few manhour could result in a huge improvement. imagine for example they put a state battleship for let's say 10 million lp in militia corporation stores. this might cause a run on fw missions, people would come in mass, pvpers would have many potential targets, missionrunners would have to do them in groups with pvp support etc. this could result in lot's of fun for all, but instead the missions are less profitabel than the boring highsec grindmissions (after traveltime), so noone is doing them.there have been many good proposals in that last 6 months, great ideas on how things could get more exciting in proposal forum and other idea threads. i'd be happy to see anything that improves fw, don't like to tie myself down to one specific idea."
12/18/2008,"i think it would add a lot to world immersion, if the empire factions had more distinctive identity. this is especially about the sub-factions.take the amarr, for example. amarr ships are shiney gold. but there are also the khanid, who seem to prefer their ships much darker. yet there are only amarr noobships and amarr shuttles. why are there no khanid noobships and shuttles? it could easily be the same ship, but with a unique skin.this is also the case for stations. it would not be much effort to make khanid stations look like khanid stations, even if they use the amarr station model.at the same time, it would be awesome to do the same for the faction ships. or at least for some of them. why not add a khanid navy slicer to the khanid lp store? make it black and switch the laser bonus for a rocket bonus and give it rocket launchers instead of turrets. not really a big change, but it would mean something more to be khanid.i'm just using the amarr as an example, because they are the most diverse empire with the most unique subfactions. to some degree, this can be applied to most other empire factions, though some are more uniform than others. and yes, i am aware that this is mostly a flavor and immersion thing. eyecandy. yet things that help players to identify with the game world usually turn out to be something that keeps them playing after trial. it would also diversify the world of eve so that not everything in every region looks exactly the same."

12/18/2008,"if you don't like solitude, the solution is simple. don't go to solitude. i think it is perfect. great place. working as intended, fitting it's name."
12/18/2008,looking at the agents in solitude... looks like they have a couple really nice spots to mess around in. you have a good lvl 4 agent which is far enough from low sec to not be bothered.there's 3 low sec systems cul-du-saced right there... only way to get to those systems for pirates would be to pod or capital jump there... for what purpose?if the region is so bad... nobody will be there and the pirates have no targets.so really i suspect those low sec systems are quite dead. great place to build capships right in the station there.buy order all the lewt and minerals from the mission runners there. reprocess and transport them to the station.epic profits with very little risk if nobody goes there...
12/18/2008,"sorry for the cross posting, but i didn't wanna hijack the original thread.when does issues get put before ccp?basically i just wanna ask how often an issue can be brought to the attension of ccp.i can see a case for not having the same issue offered up by the same sitting of csm's more than once, unless it's like super urgent like ccp shutting eve i would want the csm to raise that issue with ccp like every 3 or 4 seconds.but seriously if an issue is still gaining a lot of support and still being discussed shouldn't it be able to be offered up to ccp again?surely the main purpose of the csm is to give ccp a strong indication of the player perspective? am i wrong? and if something is still an issue why shouldn't it be raised again with a different stting of csm's. at best something might have changed and ccp will act on it. at worse they will say ""nothing's changed, what's next on the agrenda?"" and the csm have done it's job of informing ccp of the player's concerns?"
12/18/2008,"i don't want to derail this thread any more than i must to let you know, but there are a significant number of threads already open in which this has been discussed.it's not considered an exploit, since you can either fail/restart the mission, or allow the item to respawn after downtime.that being said, i've seen gm's actually 'give' the mission item back to disgruntled mission runners if you ask really, really nicely.(i've stolen more than one mission item in my past, both from friend and foe alike, and have received reports of this, or denials from the gms. what i haven't heard is anyone getting in trouble for doing it, which is good.)sorry to derail, but i did a search for your name, jason, and noticed that you hadn't posted any discussion of this anywhere else.carry on, gentlemen.ninja edit: i reread your statement about your petitions, and may have been confused about you calling theft of a mission item an exploit or not, so don't take offense if i don't go into detail and rewrite my above post. if you didn't mean you thought it to be an exploit, you don't need to post a huge wall about it. just looking to save you a bunch of typing."
12/19/2008,"so, by your logic, do you think that ccp should make all loot drops the ownership of the guy who's ship you killed, including npc pirates? right now, if you shoot npc's, the loot dropped belongs to the killer, and all we're asking for is the same for pvp kills. (if you don't agree yet, tell me why the two should be different.)you know, if we do make everything the same, and npc loot drops are owned by the first person to pick them up, then that means anytime i'm ninja salvaging in a mission, i have the ability to loot everything, without the fear that the mission runner has any ability to shoot.put the vote up for that one, my friend, and see what comes out of the woodwork."
12/19/2008,"example as to why op is wrong.i walk down the street and shoot someone.i then take their wallet from theor corpse's pocket.it does not magically become my wallet, it becomes murder & robbery.eve being an immersive game tries to use ownership laws that are simple to work with and that reflect a realistic dynamic.just because you broke it does not mean you paid for it.why are npcs different?well you're bounty hunting and eve applies some cool old laws around in the days of cowboys and other cool stuff.in some jurisdictions, if you killed or brought in a known fellon you were given rights to their possessions (those not needing to be confiscated for being aquired illegally).also see privateering.so, for being criminals, concord is pretty much suspending the ownership rights of the pirates and gives those rights to the ""bounty hunter"" as a ""reward"".yay for six-gun justice!"
12/19/2008,"more to the point, when shooing an npc, the npc's in their ""gang"" are shooting at you anyway.i would never support this and i feel it's the wrong fix.people that support this and use npc loot belongs to me argument have a more simple fix.the loot remains that of the npc, meaning if you steal from the loot can, you are agro to the corp/alliance of the npc.there are two fixes:-1) fix it the wrong way, the way the op suggests. you are on the hook for killing, not stealing. if you steal, then you're on the hook for both.2) change the npc to always own the loot. this would be more correct, and logical.be careful of what you ask for, the profession of looting peoples cans in missions would be very profitable :)"
12/19/2008,i fully support/endorse this thread because it is made of win.
12/19/2008,i approve so long as strict limits are placed on such a feature. i'm thinking a 6 month cooldown and a ten dollar fee. that way the potential for abuse becomes very small.
12/19/2008,"balancing and price should be left up to ccp. you have to hope they do it correctly, and express your concerns."
12/19/2008,exactly. the explosion velocity stuff is out of line. look at rockets for example. they do full damage to.. what? a turtle? a glacier? a planet? it's stupid.

12/19/2008,name and shame the cheaters. full transparency!
12/19/2008,this was actually pretty clever.thanks for the post.
12/19/2008,butbutbut i thought ccp were sweeping all this under the rug to cover up for their cheating friends???? how can they be releasing more information now and continuing with their investigation this is all so confusing!
12/19/2008,"justify this:started playing eve may this year. i played for months, then they put a major patch in. some things changed and i put in a petition. discovered i was playing a game no one else had access to. being a noob, i didn't belong to a corp or alliance, didn't know the game i was playing was different from the one everyone else was playing. to make an incredibly long story short, ccp gmc was provided screen shots,databases, etc., and to this day they insist the game we were playing did not and does not exist. they removed ""non-existent"" items from my hangar; got all the details from me; had eye-witness account from one of their ""players"" befriending me in-game and actually playing that game with me. i didn't know the rats didn't talk to everyone, etc., announce when enemies entered the system, etc. i know now, so i played for 5 months this game.it was a game code hidden in eve that i stumbled upon and won! and they took it from me. they know one of theirs is cheating for someone. i won a game i wasn't suppose to. they took it from me. they deny to this day that game exists. ccp will never oust the culprits because the culprit is ccp. that game was entirely too extensive for it not to have been programmed. told me i was finding a series of plexes, and explorations that never appeared in my tabs. in other words, they lied and when the lie didn't work they denied, then closed their eyes and blamed it on my noobiness.i have pages and pages of communications between my self and ccp petition personnel. they insist, ""if the people who wrote the program say that game does not exist, it doesn't. they would know"". if they didn't investigate that - they won't investigate this. people who have viewed my documentation agree - this was for someone other than me ! ! ! it is not an exploit, not a bug. it is programed cheating.if this body wants copies of my documentation and correspondence between ccp and myself and all others involved, we will gladly provide it. those who quit over this cheat are willing to come back and provide evidence. others are too disgusted and won't. now, mr. bunyip, are you for us or them. you have a viable, genuine, living willing victim here. are you, this body, going to investigate and prevent further cheating? we are proof ccp not only condones but programs these cheats into their game. why else would they not investigate when all proof is provided?"
12/19/2008,"so let me get this right. we have griefers upset because they can't war dec peeps in npc corps and the resulting posts are how to get these npc corp players out into the ""real"" world of eve. to which i reply, who made you god?are there are not enough players that are in corps that you cannot war dec? or are you simply looking for easy kills to pad your epeen?better yet, if you want to prove yourself just come on out to alliance space and i'm sure you will find all the pvp'ing you want. oh? whats that? the alliance members will gang up and kill you instead? so you get to avoid being massacred by staying out of alliance space yet you don't want to afford a equal refuge for those who choose to not to get involved in the darker side of eve. i think i sense the word ""loser"" cropping up."
12/19/2008,"hmm... ok, we force people out of the npc corporations, they either make their own or get assigned to another, they get war deced. they can close and start another one making the entire point moot or just stop playing all together because they can nolonger play a game the way they want to...forget this quickly. theres a reason that it's called high security. if you don't like it, go somewhere else. as for me, because i dislike all the pvp, and insane ranting that goes with being affiliated with corps i'm going back to a npc corp. you call me carebear. i call me player vs environment. i'm also going to point out the most epic flaw by the op. 100% safe. no such thing.yes, this is an alt, but i figured this here post is worth the darwin award."

12/19/2008,"there's been quite a few troll threads demanding ccp to release the names of all parties involved in the pos exploit. these threads all have lots of responses, yet thumbs up supports rarely break single digit numbers and are mostly alts.so i guess let's create an anti-name-naming thread. i believe ccp should not name the people involved for the following reasons:1) a ccp name list will not restore, destroy, or otherwise affect the market.2) nobody has anything to gain or lose by knowing who was involved.3) a list of names does not change what happened.4) despite what a handful of trolls may have claimed, the csms are neither responsible for what happened nor have any interest in creating more drama.5) ccp does not yet have all the facts regarding the matter.and most importantly:6) such a list serves no other purpose except to fuel trolls.say no to troll fuel."
12/19/2008,i agree with what you said. i also believe that ccp has every right to not release thin information if they so choose. if they do decide to release then information i do not think that it will have any bearing on how things proceed with the game.slade
12/19/2008,"as a csm, i support this matter."
12/19/2008,"it is ccp's policy not to reveal exploiters' names, why do you bother with a thread? they won't reveal it, it's long confirmed.drama is also what fuels the more interesting members of our community, the ones that make the headlines. it's not carebears or miners that advertise eve online."
12/19/2008,this thread is very suspicious. hiding the truth only serves the guilty. are you one of them?
12/19/2008,"lol, no troll fuel for you. and this really is my main."
12/19/2008,this is irrelevant.ccp has a long standing policy of privacy and they won't break with that.privacy rights aren't something you just throw away when they're inconvenient.
12/19/2008,"i am not trying to troll anybody. mine was a fair question and your attitude, calling names, is lamentable. are you guilty? because i see no motive to start a topic like this if you are not. ps this toon is two months old, this is not your main account."
12/19/2008,"yes, this toon is indeed about two months old and yes it really is my main. it may be hard to comprehend, but this game does have new players."
12/19/2008,"either you are a two months old player who has a strong interest in hiding the identities of very old characters in very old corps you barely know, or you are a very old player lying to us. call me paranoid but i bet in the second option."
12/19/2008,"well, aright then. you're a very paranoid troll looking for fuel and not getting it.and i will not argue with you anymore. anyone who thinks privacy protectors are hiding something has no real point. your trolling intentions are obvious."
12/19/2008,"in which way am i a troll? i disagreed with you and questioned your motives, and for the second time you failed in defending your point of view and making your motives clear. instead you opted to call me a troll yet again...revealing characters' names has nothing to do with privacy. privacy is a concept that applies to people not fictitious characters. eve characters are ccp's property, especially now that the owners are banned. whose privacy do you want to protect? the players? unless ccp decides to post the players' names nobody will know who they are. the only believable explanation is that your main is associated with the cheaters, and you don't want people prodding at you and your business because you have something to hide."
12/19/2008,"lol, what an obvious troll thread."
12/19/2008,"i do not want the playrs names, i am more or less happy with them being band. i would like the names of corps nowingly involved, i would like to know this for bisness reasons. i quite simply would like to not do bisness with them."
12/19/2008,"while each of your reasons is sound, there is one very good reason why a name and shame would be a good idea.as a deterrant. if, in future, a similar exploit was found would you risk using it knowing that when it was discovered you, your corp and your alliance would all be publicly named? in fact, if you found out that your corp or alliance was using such an exploit, would you stay silent, knowing that your corp's and alliance's name would be publically dragged through the mud once the exploit became public knowledge? i know i wouldn't be willing to do that. mind you, i wouldn't have been willing to cheat in the first place all that would do is remove the challenge from the game and at that point, what's the point in playing? it would be no fun anymore.or would you, instead, properly report the exploit and not touch it with a 10 foot pole, thus keeping you, your corp and your alliance free of the stain of being labelled cheaters?"
12/19/2008,"when you started using ad hominem attacks from your first post in this thread. she posted her motives and and point of view in her first post. you decided you don't like them and that is ok, but then you decided to confute them using baseless accusations and personal attack instead of confuting the argument.that make you a troll. for the op: supported"
12/19/2008,"interesting argument, but there are some logic fallacies in it.1) your deterrent work the other way: if i did know of someone using an exploit in my corp/alliance if the effect of reporting the exploit would be to get my corp/alliance named and shamed i would be less willing to report, not more. i would be willing to try to stop him and even expell him from the corp/alliance, but not to report him as it will damage my corp/alliance. so the deterrent woudl have exactly the opposite effect of what you are seeking to accomplish.2) naming and shaming would damage a whole corp/alliance for the action of one player. how many players will get an alt in a enemy corp/alliance and then purposefully exploit in a blatant way, reporting the exploit so that the enemy alliance get the blame? don't say no one as we know that metaplay plots and alt sabotage are common in eve."
12/19/2008,"unfortunately, yes. that is one possible scenario.however, in the first case, that would be an effective sanction. you find someone using an exploit in your corp/alliance then you cut them loose as soon as you're aware that they're doing it. then you contact ccp and tell them that this character had been doing this, that your corp/alliance wants nothing to do with this exploit. at that point, ccp is aware that you have done everything in your power to bring this to their attention and so it's only the character that's named and shamed, not the corp or alliance.if, however, you do find out about it and fail to act then by your inaction you're effectively supporting the exploiter in his actions and should face the consequences of that action.where this falls down is when a character is using an exploit in such a way that it's obvious that multiple people had to have known, but that those in power in the corp weren't aware of what was going on. if the exploit is done in such a way that only the exploiter benefits then it's harder for the corporation to know whats going on.as to the idea of an alt spy coming in and doing an exploit to get an alliance or corp into trouble, i assume that, while you don't necessarily heavily vet every person coming in, you do carefully screen those who could get into a position to be able to do this as it would be very difficult to pull off without roles in a corp/alliance. that, and the spy always runs the risk that the exploit would be discovered by the corp/alliance that he's infiltrated and be cut adrift. at that point, investigations could link his alt to his main and lead to his mains alliance being sanctioned instead.-----in truth, there's no easy answer to any of this. all i gave was a possible scenario, the details would still need to be hammered out."

12/19/2008,release the real names of all the whiners!
12/19/2008,i say no
12/19/2008,"i am sorry, no. you are an apologist from the npc corp. so, you are an alt of someone. i will not claim ev0ke. or any other involved entity, but, let people draw their own conclusions.1) post with your main. 2) do not excuse inexcusable behavior.3) csm is there to represent players, not a player, so how do you presume to say that csm is not interested? are you disguised csm? 4) and to csm who voted in this silly, and insulting thread, are you not interested in what happened? because i understand not being interested in drama, but the way op has phrased it, it can be inferred he wants you not to be interested at all. i agree on:ccp does not have all information yet - but they will soon enough, one can hope. we should give ccp some time, provided they give as detailed account as possible about what happened. since last thing i want to do is compete with players who have gained unfair advantage. best of luck in your apologist campaign."
12/19/2008,"venkul, are you close with anyone at ccp or something? most people are calling for disclosure in the most egregious of cases, not for every silly infraction players may be accused of. and all are calling for the disclosure in this particular case, no one said anything about future cases. the size of exploit is too big to ignore, and it benefited too many 0.0 alliances, and yea i do want to know who benefited.because if i see the alliance, corporation, people involved, destroyed - then i will see that ccp does it job, rather they tell me they do their jobs. also, i want other questions answered, how members of ev0ke knew ahead of time that their accounts will be banned, before the ccp announcements - where in ccp did the leak come from?"
12/19/2008,"cyprus black is most likely the alt of a csm member. i find it very likely that its main is one of the two csm that are vocal in this subject. which is really pytiful. anyways, my vote is abviously no."
12/19/2008,"funny thing about personal interpretation, it can be ""inferred"" in many ways to meet the point of anyone who has one. just as i question your motives for wanting a witch hunting list, you question my motives for advocating privacy protection.and i'm secretly a csm in hiding now? how many theories is that so far? it went from secretly being one of the parties involved who got banned, to secretly being a ccp representative, to secretly being an alt, to secretly making a fortune from this exploit, and now secretly being a csm. wow, what's next? i'm secretly batman?desperation is obvious when trolls are throwing anything and everything at the wall to see what sticks. more crackpot theories please. i find them hysterical.(and i really am batman)"
12/19/2008,hell yes.... everyone should stfu and get on with there lives.this is a game for cryin out loud... ccp punished the exploiters... enough is enough./signed emphatically.
12/19/2008,"it would certainly be nice to know bob isn't the only one getting ""dev help"" from the rumor mongers.gee...ccp told everyone who t20 helped out...come on, release the bloody list!!"
12/19/2008,name them
12/19/2008,"you're trying so hard to not get have the names revealed, i thought back in that other thread that you probably have something to hide...i love the way that anyone who you disagree with are trolls."
12/19/2008,i love the way that anyone who disagrees with you and your friends is involved in exploiting. accusing people of exploiting without proof are the actions of trolls not concerned players. gtfo and +1 support.
12/19/2008,"well what can i say, i don't like trolls .and so far it's only been the trolls who are demanding a list. i haven't heard a single reasonable and rational explanation yet as to why anyone needs a witch hunting list except for the sole purpose of trolling. they've made little attempt to mask their intentions, what with all the accusations and personal attacks. all these attacks do is reinforce the purpose of this thread.but please, if you have a genuine need for such a list with a use other than trolling, then post it here (assuming you're able to do so with a straight face)."
12/19/2008,"what privacy rights are you raving about? pixels have no privacy rights. i would understand if people were asking for the real names and addresses - concern can be raised that way. but, certainly not for the names of fictional characters in fictional corporations. also, as i said before, the exploit is just too magnificent in its scope to be limited in any way to just one or two entities. because of its size, ccp must disclose to the rest of the eve community those who participated, to do otherwise would invite too many accusations of misconduct. and, unfortunately, we can not rely on csm to tell us the truth because ccp has the ""banstick of nda"" hanging over them, and tells them what they can and can not say to us. now, it is also in human nature to want to know the truth. it is very much natural that criminals in the world outside of eve, once it is determined that they are criminals, do not enjoy any type or right of privacy regarding the crime they have committed, and their names are available to the public upon request. what has happened here was criminal in terms of eve. they have subverted a system, they have gained advantage which is not available to the rest of the community, and they have put that advantage to work to systematically achieve their goals in the game which is all about competition. anyone who says that they ""do not want to know"" are not telling the truth, to put it mildly. i would compare it to someone saying "" i do not want to know what heinous crime that criminal committed, because it does not matter to me, even if he is a recidivist and might murder my cat in the middle of the night""the only reason you would not want to know, or rather try to convince others that they ""should not be interested in knowing"" is if you are worried yourself about the outcome of that knowledge, or that the inquiry might go deeper than it has gone now - which is surface, 70 alts banned, some isk removed, not a big deal, god forbid ccp really starts to dig and examine every rock and cardboard box, who knows what sort of names might start pouring out of it, maybe it would even be your main! not that i am saying it would. i know, it is easy to label a ""troll"" to anyone who disagrees with you, and it is easy to say that this is a tornado in teacup, well, just remember that all things are tornadoes in a teacup till they get to grow into a real scandals, and, i think you actually know it too well, and do not want it to go any further than it has gone thus far. the harder unknown npc alt characters on this forums will try and convince us that what happened is not a big deal, and that we do not need to know, the more suspicious reasonable people should become, and ask why don't we need to know?"
12/19/2008,"i have to ask... so you find out who it is.then what?your going to gank them? scream at them? troll them?its a damn game.seriously people.... this is a total waste of time.all your doing is trolling for conspiratorial and political crap.if this was a real life crime... like a murder....or a robbery... fine.but ccp has chosen to say no...and here you are crying like a bunch of damn babies.seriously.. i've grown tired of seeing you all throw a fit.there's no real benefit let alone ""prize"" to be had for knowing.... let alone not knowing.so you find out.... knowing is only going to either make you stupid.... or.... well just foolish period."
12/19/2008,"if i have ever heard alt tripe before... if we find out out, and have an exhaustive report from ccp, which i hope we will, it will tell us that a lot of very bad players have been removed from the game. it will tell us that number of bad alliances and corporations can be suspect, and it will also open avenue for retribution within the game from those who have been on the receiving end of the exploiters. knowing will make you stupid! ahha, now that you put it that way, i do not want to be stupid, so i will not want to know. no real benefit in knowing! i understand! why bother, why would anyone want to care about things that might diminish one's ability n a competitive game! you right. you right, we should all listen to you and go quietly play a pvp game with limited resources, while knowing full well that there are others who had unlimited resources and are still might be enjoying something for nothing, as opposed to the players who had to spend time and effort to get where we are now."
12/19/2008,*snip - mitnal*this is my main.... not an alt.secondly... you take this game way to seriously if all you care is about your frakking score and the number of kills you make.ccp says they removed exploiters from the game.... that should be more than enough.all i see is a bunch of egotistical jackasses who want blood.fine then... go out and yarr your brains out... while i sit here and pay attention to things that really matter... like reality.honestly im shocked ccp tolerates you people as much as they do!this is a flipping game people... not real life and death.
12/19/2008,"if you made sense, then i would love to have a proper conversation with you. but, unfortunately you did not. yes it is a game, it is also a hobby. ccp does have a precedent, long running, of precipitating, whether imaginary, or real, scandals.if someone messes with my hobby, i would like to know. ccp opened the door with their transparency stuff with csm - they have shown some, but not really. ccp can, and should do more. csm can, and should do more. i also have great hope that both csm and ccp will give us more. so far, even if disagreeing with you, and your op buddy, i have shown great restraint, and i am glad. you are right this is a game, and good for me that i do not loose temper on the forums, and have some command of my faculties that allows me to respond properly and reasonably to those who wish to argue the merits without animosity. unless, of course, you consider me calling you and op alts is animosity - was just a thought at the back of my head when i see some failed logic combined with a controversial subject, and alt corpies, makes me think ""alt"" does not want to reveal his main, because he knows him, and his buddies, so far, are on the loosing side of the public opinion. sorry about calling you and op an alt, i know it is subjective, since whichever character you are currently using can be called a ""main"" and your ""main"" then becomes an alt."
12/19/2008,"i have only mentioned that about cyprus black, out of all the people who stand on the other side of the argument.cyprus black however, responds with troll to all who oppose - quite a difference don't you think?""the lady doth protest too much, methinks."""
12/19/2008,"considering what you are tossing around here i think i need to clarify my position.i would like to know the names of the offenders, but i do not beleive that ccp has any duty to disclose said information. i also believe that a witchhunt that includes saying that the csm needs to be disassembled since they were unable to get ccp to disclose the information you ask for, is ludacris.that being said, i have invested much less, time, energy, and emotion then many pilots in this game. i just may see that this cheat was just one other advantage old players have had since my first day in eve. it is a cold universe, so i have been told, some cheaters got busted, so unless you feel that you can find the trail to legit pilots better then ccp could then i think we should let this take its natural course.slade"
12/19/2008,"i wonder which threads you've been reading really. there have been some good arguments on both sides in my opinion, along with some terrible ones with no real substance, or just being totally irrelevant. (both sides again.)if you want to play this game, then we shall. allow me to take a look at your argument in the op first if you will:no reason not to name them then if it will not harm or affect the market if some players feel it matters.again, then there is no reason not to name them, if - in your opinion - no one loses nor gains. we think it will benefit the player base to reveal, you think it won't affect either way. there is little logic so far to your arguments...agreed. however, again that works the same as the two above. with no negative effects, no reason not to name.of course they are not responsible for what happened. please link any post relating to this exploit which indicates anyone has said this. regarding the creating of drama, well again we can assume that they don't have any intention of doing so - just getting answers to the questions from the player base.again, plese point me to a post that states otherwise. what does this have to do with releasing character names, and who said that the names need to be revealed prior to the end of the investigation? if they didn't think the characters were cheating they wouldn't have perma-banned them - they obviously had all the facts they needed for those 70 or so accounts.in your opinion of course. yet, you've said nothing that provides evidence that it will have negative effects - except maybe this childish ""troll fuel"" notion. the irony is, you're actually as bad a troll as those you condemn."
12/19/2008,"now, please allow me to provide you with some reasoning as to why the names should be released. with a straight face of course.some players seem to be very interested in ensuring that these are not ""token"" bans. aside from ev0ke, no one has officially confirmed any notable corps or alliance names.it's entirely possible that the banned accounts are mostly alts, and that the main characters are still very much able to play the game and are living off the proceeds untouched. it would also go some way to serve those corps and alliances that have been part of the cheating speculation - in clearing their name.sure alliances like bob will forever be tainted in the eyes of some players, and involved in every rumour and indeed there will likely be cries of a cover-up if no bob character is mentioned. eve isn't just about bob though, and they seem to be thick-skinned enough to deal with the fact that some players just accept as fact these unfair and unfounded assumptions. ccp own everything in game. all character names included. they can pretty much ban you for playing for no apparent reason. it's their game, their right. claiming that it's a breach of privacy to reveal the names is ridiculous - and only furthers theories that something suspicious is taking place, when really there is no need for them to hide behind this ridiculous notion when simply saying they choose not to as it serves no purpose is more credible. for the record, just like with unsubbed training - we know it's ccp's game. we know they can make changes to it for no apparent reason.we know ultimately it's up to them if they reveal the names or not. we know they can do as they like. it's the last part that is particularly disturbing to some of it's subscribers"
12/19/2008,this is similar to an idea i've had. so i support. here is my idea: new warfare addition
12/19/2008,i agree
12/19/2008,"sadly this isn't a case of nobody cares, but nobody seems to see anything being done about them.i support monthly reports on numbers, not names."
12/19/2008,"i would like to see a complete revamp of the ingame mail client. this is what i would like to see:personal mail: - change the personal mail to work more like a real mail inbox. mail inboxes in the real world have evolved and the mail inboxes ingame need to evolve as well - i need a sent items folder so i can tell what i have sent and who i have sent it to - i need a trash folder to hold items for 15 or 30 dayscorporate mailbox - scratch the mailbox idea completely. and change the corporate mail into a corporate forum. similar to phpbb, or the eve forums. - that is all, just make the corporate mail into corporate discussion forum with the ability to make forums, sub forums, threads, and pollsalliance mailbox: - same idea as corporate mailboxthese ideas will take up alot of room on the current eve database. do you think you could move the mail/forum to a different rack of computers with a different database so that it will not put a load on the current server?"

12/19/2008,"i am not going to repeat myself. read my posts in this thread and you may realize it. if you don't, oh well, your loss..."
12/19/2008,csm is a joke.
12/19/2008,no
12/19/2008,"yep agreed, ccp should disclose all of whats been happening , who didi it, who is associated with these people and what have they done to prevent that something like this will never happen again.again its like i said once , the csm business is a whole circus of figures fighting for notoriety ( lol! ) and the their own interests in the game, they have brought nothing good and new to the game or the the comunity and have served as ccp's shield from the players, this case just shows it.ccp's statement that disclosing a nickname is a privacy violation is about the most dumb thing i have ever read, for that matter you wouldn't disclose player names on reports, on tournaments, on internet blogs and websites doing publicity for the game.further it shows that ccp has no measure of control over its gtc system, it has no respect for the people that pay the game to play by allowing this farse to continue."
12/19/2008,wish that were true - you've been repeating yourself for days.oh well.
12/19/2008,"it that is true, at least i can pledge that i have been doing it a lot less than people like you, who insist in making the same arguments time and again without even reading the posts that came before yours."
12/19/2008,yes they should
12/19/2008,hahahahaha...
12/19/2008,i find it quite revealing that this piece of news aint directed to a forum thread to discuss
12/19/2008,"you do seem to know a lot - or should i say 'presume'? you do not know me, nor what i have or have not read, done or have not done etc. you assume i haven't read, as i disagree with you. and people that disagree with you, must be silly, stupid, uninterested and have not read the forums - because who could disagree with someone that obviously is as intelligent as you, sir?ad hominems, ad infinitum and ad nauseam - that seems to be the way you think you need to 'discuss'. the simple fact that someone disagrees with you on, of all things, a game makes personal attacks necessary? in stead of attacking my view or remark, you retort by saying that i must not have read the posts. please, do get some lessons on math, reading and rhetorics - so far, you don't seem to be doing to well in this and other threads. but that's my personal opinion, i'm sure you'll find some way to disagree with that.have fun, i know i am (in game that is) ."
12/19/2008,"if you had read the posts where the answers to your allegations were written, you would have discussed about the answer and not repeated the allegations. therefore it is not a matter of you disagreeing, just of your neglect to read what has been already posted. i don't need to presume it, it is evident.the person that was most attacked in this thread was me, i can assure you. if i made any attack to posters was as an answer to similar attacks and with considerably more class i should say"
12/19/2008,"hi folks,on the night of today i<U+FFFD>m trying to make some isks minering as i do every game session, but i cant, all asteroids belts from my home base (isamm) and 8 jumps always on every direction (i was on .6 trhu .8 system) are depleted or only with few veldspar rocks? what happening? the rocks burned by theyselfs? i don<U+FFFD>t think so. it<U+FFFD>s a clean up work did by macro runners, so can you investigate it? that becomes impossible to run a decent game when some chinese farmers tooks all of the things.thanks a lot,regards,alcides freitas(jukabala)"
12/19/2008,you don't need a macro-mining horde to clean out belts like that.a medium sized corp mining op is enough to do the job.
12/19/2008,my old corp i was in had 2 guys in hulks perfect mining. billions spent on the perfect mining upgrades and implants. an alt for hauling. they would get on right after downtime and would strip belts of all ore and would clear about 5 belts an hour or so.all you guys are so paranoid about macrominers and really they arent that much of a problem. normal(well that's debatable) players are the ones stripping the belts.
12/19/2008,"yet oddly enough, most low sec asteroid belts are still brimming with ore.hmm, could be an issue of low sec vs high sec profitability and risk."
12/19/2008,"just spawn yourself your very own veldspar.how? don't ask me, it's easy enough for you to find out by yourself."
12/19/2008,i agree with the posters above. high sec must have disadvantages.
12/19/2008,"monday and friday are the big high sec roid respawn days. this means that sundays and thursdays can be rather barren.besides there are plenty of high sec roids around, you just need to get even further away from the hubs than you are now."
12/19/2008,"some missions have really big roids in them, and you could try probing for special belts too.but yeah, mining got boosts to yield but the belts do not match. i rather see different solutions than simply spawning more roids though."
12/19/2008,"anyway we need a solution . . . soon.recently reprocessing shuttles was an easy way to get (almost) free veldspar but it do not work anymore.now, belts are depleting at an alarmous rate !having dynamic respawn (depending on belts status in a system) should be a temporary answer, having the same belts way bigger (i mean really bigger) should another one, but you would have to rebalance minerals ratios.there is no easy answer to this issue but we need one asap : do not talk about lowsec & 0.0 as logistic is really an issue to small corps/fleets (guess why the orca is such a success).anyway, miners need love as they're building the ships we loose in pve/pvp . . ."
12/19/2008,"guys guys guys... have you forgotten the new powerhouse on the block? orca's can help entire systems be depleted within a few scant hours now. it's a combo job of a hauler/booster with only 2 hulks and you can strip a belt in one go.now multiply the above by 6 as there are probably that many orca's floating about in high sec. never a problem with low sec mining, just risk. go in a newbship and avoid combat and you can (slowly) get almost anything you need."
12/19/2008,"suppoert, this could get really interesting on undocking point pr size =)"
12/19/2008,good idea !no more station camping !
12/19/2008,"i agree, you can only play one character at a time wich is fine.we ought to be able to train at least two characters to try different tracks out."
12/19/2008,"this.this is the type of information that you may expect to be published from a publicly traded company, which ccp is not.edit: what would the average player need this information for? my answer would be absolutely nothing.edit 2: i think that with consistantly logging on, at various times of the day, spreading across all time zones, on a weekly basis, and seeing 25,000+ pilots logged on at all times, is enough of a ""health check"" for me.slade"
12/19/2008,don't care.
12/19/2008,"for years now the market discussion forum has been considered, by the majority of the community that participate, as the secondary market. it's also been considered the place to go when you have a theory, or an idea, or just plain old speculation on changes ccp has made to in game mechanics or added/remove/change items. it is also discussed things that effect the games economy like, school's back in, there will be a decrease in ship sales. so what happened?i had posted that a sticky thread by ccp mitnal contained about seven links all pertaining to ipo's and the secondary market. it's clear that one ccp moderator has considered ""market discussions"" forum is meant for this type of discussion. for a while ipo discussion took place here, questions and answers where posted, while the sales of the shares actually took place on the sales forum. the change of the way the secondary market functions such as more bonds, more banks, more loans, changed the way md functioned. no more shares being sold, meant the sales forum was bypassed. just a single post in md covered the rules and regulations that ccp has indicated but never verified.the recent change to all of this indeed the straw that broke the secondary market's discussion in md. moving it to the top of the forum injected new blood new life at the same time bringing all aspects of the community to come crashing down. gone are the days of deep intelligent discussion about the aspects of eve and the market that makes up the eve economy. this type of discussion is trolled, spammed, and eventually locked/moved, or shutdown because the new members don't want to hear about it. the unfortunate side effect of this, if the newer members of the community feel they have to comment on such threads instead of just letting them go. they believe the forum is meant to be about ""how do to <enter action>"" and ""why does this happen?"" type threads.i think that is what the newer members don't seem to understand. up until recently the members of this community talked about everything and anything real life or eve that could affect the way eve functions. scrolling back though the history of the md forum, you'll see many topic that had lengthy civilized discussion about things that are changing due a patch, totally unrelated to the primary or secondary market, however are based around how this will impact the economy.a community defined by webster's dictionary:-3) a group of nations having common interests; ""they hoped to join the nato community""this point is what defines a community on the internet. a group of random people who share common interests. for years the common interests of the participants of the market discussion was based heavily on the secondary market, ipo, bonds. it also contained discussion about changes of the game, and in general anything that real world or eve universe that could affect the primary and secondary markets of eve.my proposal is to request ccp create a new forum specially called ""secondary market discussion"".the reason for this is the current market discussion forum is not the community it once was, the regular participants of the community before it was moved tried to maintain, help and even guide the newer members to a new aspect of eve they may not have considered. trolling by one or two particular individuals and their alts, have destroyed the market discussion forum.please give the secondary market a new home, the volume of posts based around the secondary market was good enough for its own forum for years, the volume of new posts by the newer members seeking assistance for all thing primary market related is beyond enough to warrant its own forum."
12/19/2008,posting to support my own
12/19/2008,"sorry, can't support this.in summary, wrong solution to a non-existant problem.you can never go back to the ""good old days"", however it is that you remember them. things change. people grow and move on. creating a new forum will not bring back all the old times.the trolls had found md long before the forums where rearranged. just like the quality posters, the trolls come and go.what makes you think that the trolls will ignore your new utopian forum?finally as ccp hammer said:you can read every post for the past 24 hours on the first page. the second page will take you back 3 days."
12/19/2008,"not trying to create the ""good old days"" trying to get ccp to define an area for such discussion. at the moment the amount of trolling and thread moving back and forth, and believe it is moving back and forth, one mod moves it, another moves it back. it's clear ccp's mods don't quiet know where this type of discussion is meant to be.a troll reports these types of discussion as irrelevant to the forum, so a mod moves it, but has a hard time moving it to a location where it fits.although it may seems like i'm ""trying to hold onto something i enjoy"". this is really just trying to get a definitive answer or at least a home for such discussion. one that both the trolls and the regulars that have constructive participation can agree on."
12/19/2008,"i would expect that adding a new forum would only make that much worse.the problem is with moderation, not with forum structure. i would tend to lean towards the less-is-more approach: unless the thread is obviously off-topic, just leave it where it is. game development, features and ideas, and technology lab, all have that problem to a far greater degree than market discussion."
12/19/2008,"then i would change my request for a definitive statement made by ccp that market discussion is where these types of threads need to be. this will help the moderators job, and squelch the trolls that believe this is not what the forum is for.either a new forum, or someone from ccp telling us all this is where it belongs would have a similar effect. at the moment no one from ccp has come forth and said anything of that nature. sure they've hinted to it by supporting threads etc. all that is missing is a single sticky thread stating what this forum is about, or at least what ccp would like to see this forum being used for.it can even be anything general like ""all discussion above the eve economy, and any items that may effect it."" or ""discussion of the so-called secondary market and anything related to that particular market."" of cause it can have ""get tips on market activity"" etc.you can't deny the mods are having a difficult time when a thread that gets reported doesn't have defined home. it's very plainly evident on the forums at the moment. this is mealy a request for ccp to finally define this type and style of discussion. this will help not only the moderators, but will also help the entire eve player base."
12/19/2008,successful skunk is surprisingly very successful. i think this troll goes to 11...:spinaltap:
12/19/2008,i looked at a world map....7am gmt seems like it would be good for all kinda.....makes it like 7am in england....waaayyyy too early or late to be playing....like 3-6pm for aussies....should be at work.....by the time it hits the west coast of usa we are talking 12am or 1am or someting....time to go to bed.... and by the time it hits east coast its still like 3 or 4am which is really time to go to bed lol.but whatever...it seems that even thinking about this is a wasted effort as opinions are like *******s.....everyone has one and they all stink.
12/19/2008,"hi.here i have created a thread where i posted my ideas (i tried to be creative) on how to improve / redesign the current black ops ships as they are currently vastly underused compared to how much (i think) they would be used if they had been just a bit looked into and tweaked.the thread contains both black ops as they currently are and describes their role through my experienece in active combat and right beneath it are 2-4 possible solutions that i have come up with.it would be really nice if someone could take a look at it and give me some support on this in csm ( and in that thread) if it looks good enough and if the ideas sound sound to you.sincerely,virgo"
12/19/2008,"i can imagine that the harsh ingame realities reflect on you out of game as well.after all, goons is not exactly known as roleplayers - which means if youreingame ""comedians"" - its not a role you play, its because youre ""comedians""<everybody replace ""comedian"" with the word that comes in your mind first>i for one, if i were a fellow csm comrade, would probably not listen too much to a comedian... if you p1ss against the wind, your trousers will start smelling. nothing you can do about it bud. to use a contrast example of someone else i dont like (in character):hardin can distinguish, because distinguishing ic/ooc-ness is a roleplayersexclusive ability that you goonies lack. hence he gets some credits for his csm work eventhough ingame he is my most hatedenemy all time (thats 5 years of ingame hate or so:-)"
12/19/2008,"that's right, even though we just learned the things we learned about pos, and just because ccp told csm and players who want pos redesign to basically ""shove it"" - we need to play nice and go away. don't any sensible csm thinks that you guys sometimes should not take no for an answer? after all you do represent the community, and as such, if ccp tells you no, on the issue that has been raised, and supported for well over 2 years, going on 3, you should try and bring it back to ccp, and tell them, sorry, we want some answers, a detailed dev blog on why no, so players can assess the situation for themselves, and not just take ccp's excuse of ""it would take too much work."" just wondering out loud here csm guys, i mean, how hard is it to mention to ccp over and over, if necessary, to take care of the community? and, i am certain, 100% certain, that should have ccp started working on the pos issue from one end, they probably would have discovered the current ""scandalous exploit"" sooner than 3 weeks ago. but, as they said, it is ""too much work"" and csm just walked away. all i would ask from csm is just not to give up, and not walk away from something that is as important as fixing the exploits, as the player retention, or many other issues out there. let ccp tell you no, and reasons, then come and tell them to us. let them tell you no over and over, it will only force players to be more vocal about it. if you keep pressuring ccp, and keep yourselves publicly accountable, eventually this will get done, and eve would be better for it. edit: and thank you bunyip, even if you backed off and edited stuff out after lv told you it was ""already brought up."" as a csm you should find out more about this issue, perhaps even champion it, since it has been asked for for years now. it is actually the longest running request on eve forums, because people refuse to let it die, and just keep asking for it over and over, despite ccps objections, and well, csms inability to get blood from stone at ccp meetings."
12/19/2008,i voted in an attempt to keep ankhesentapemkah out of the csm
12/19/2008,"there are supposed to be 3 meetings with ccp per csm term. 1 live one in iceland, and 2 online. the problem is that the last csm raised some issues before the end of their term and their last meeting didn't happen, so there is some overlap to this csm where we'll be discussing those issues in january too."
12/19/2008,why did that meeting not happen?
12/19/2008,it was scheduled to happen at the same time as fanfest. fanfest won
12/19/2008,that's me ^ (damn alts)
12/20/2008,"number of years ago i had to give up a 2003 character because, i did make a mistake, and i could not live with the name. yes, it took me 2 years to realize, or rather 2 years worth of experience to actually love eve the way i do, and i could not live with that character's name. now, i know it was difficult for me, as it might be for any others. should ccp come up with a way to trace the characters' names then i would totally support this. because there is really no reason why people should suffer for years due to immersion issues and character names if it can be avoided. so, i go by my pain, and i empathize with those who genuinely feel they have made a mistake in naming their character, and i hope ccp comes up with a way to help you guys, although they were not able to help me."
12/20/2008,play style change? decide you actually do enjoy this internet space ship game after creating a temporary character? decide you want to rp?then support changing your name!
12/20/2008,"not a whole lot of action on this anymore. nor csm response on much of anything these days.any updates, bunyip?"
12/20/2008,"like that other guy is saying the nerf idea is okay, but the numbers are off. i would like to see missiles still being used in the game in the future so i support."
12/20/2008,"i see myself with a dominix and clouds of abandoned drones at gatecamps to deal with smartbombing campbreakers...and i'm sure there's other possible exploits. as a droner, i'd love this, but i can easily see it being abused, so sorry.perhaps a hi-slot drone link renegotiator? target a drone, activate the module and wait for the cycle to finish to regain the drone? no massed drone activation then, avoiding the worst of the exploit."
12/20/2008,"a tweak for a minor annoyance, i support!"
12/20/2008,"yay, no more abandoning drones left behind in fleet fights because their owner is still in system in a pod"
12/20/2008,it would be nice if drones automatically returned to bay upon a disconnect. or at the very least regain control of them upon reconnection.
12/20/2008,i will post in support of this..

12/20/2008,must be done.
12/20/2008,would like full discloser on issuenot because i believe it is owed to me but just cause i'm curiousif ccp knew about the exploiting i highly doubt they would admit to any knowledge of it at any ratewhich is what people seem to expect they might get...lolif my tech 2 market was suffering a missive bottle neck in supply of raw materialsi might turn a blind eye to a few discreet people making a lot of isk to prop up the market with exploited materials until i could implement a feature to increase production of those raw material...ala alchemy

12/20/2008,i support this.
12/20/2008,"honestly, what are they smoking up there in iceland. has to be some good xxxx.it just makes it a pain in the tush.i login change my skill and log out.why you ask, because i do have to pay my bills and do other things. jeeesshhhh."
12/20/2008,"hello all,i would like to introduce to the game the idea of 'mini-bases' for both players new to the game and those who need a remote outpost in times of war. this idea has had other threads, but i'd like to introduce it as the follows (copied from my website):the ship-based habitat means it will start out as a ship. this ship can be flown as a normal ship, but will have special modules that highly limit it's effectiveness on the combat side without making the ship completely useless. either cruiser-size or battleship-size rigs can be bought, and fitted to the appropriate sized ship.when a ship has reached a good location that is outside of 1 au from any other permanent celestial object (planets, asteroid belts, permanent beacons, etc), the pilot can set the ship up as the sbh. this process leaves the ship entirely defenseless for 15 minutes, so other ships are often needed as protection while a ship transforms. at the end of that period, the player can either eject in a pod or in one of the ships left in the cargohold (usually a shuttle), and the ship becomes anchored to the location in space.a player can have as many sbhs as he has levels of the skill habitat management (rank 4). he can only have one in a system though, and there can be a maximum number of habitats in a system equal to some developer-decided system, such as moons. the sbh is considered a part of the person or corp, so other corp members can have access to them if given the permissions, and attacking them in high-security space will only not cause concord interference if the corporations are at war.in the sbh mode, up to 2 ships of an equal or smaller size can dock with the sbh. these ships use a gangway to link them to the sbh, so that they're outside the armor and inside the shield of the sbh. while docked at a sbh, the pilot can engage certain modules on the ship to allow it to function as a very limited pos, and these functions will run until complete (either the sbh runs out of fuel, the function runs out of the necessary components for the activity, or the pilot stops the process).certain modules can be used for a sbh, but it can also use any other passive module designed for a ship of it's type, such as hull modifications or anything else. guns are activated automatically when attacked (with a skill level of 1 unless the anti-theft system is on the sbh).when the sbh is deployed, regardless of size, the device doubles the hp of the ship and burns 10 isotopes of the appropriate type for the ship used as the basis every hour, and 1 oxygen per day. modules which double the fuel are marked with (2x) and stack with one another, so a cloak and a refiner would quadruple fuel costs.high slots habitat cloak (2x): passive module (always doubles fuel cost), reduces the chance of finding the sbh from probes to 20%.mid slots system scanner: detects the people in system/cloaked status/security status. detects ship type within 5 au. anti-theft system: detects and immediately evemails if the sbh is attacked, augments guns with the user's skill levels. drone coordinator: automatically manages and launches drones if attacked, uses the skills of the character who deployed the sbh. cryotank: stores a single jump clone for use when jumping to another location.low slots refiner (2x): refines ore at 1 m3/second and ice at 1 unit/5 minutes, otherwise works as a refining array. repair bay: enables repairs of t1 ships, the percent damaged is the cost to repair in total ship materials. munitions factory (2x): assembles ammunition from raw materials at 10% higher cost.rig slots transformation augmentor: this is the cruiser-sized rig, adding 10,000 m3 to the cargohold of the specific ship when deployed. improved transformation augmentor: this is the battleship-sized rig, adding 40,000 m3 to the cargohold of the specific ship when deployed.comments? questions?"
12/20/2008,"supporting my own topic. why you can't do that on your original post i'll never know, but i guess it comes down to ccp needing new forum software..."
12/20/2008,"bunyip .. can you outline more of the game purpose for this? the reasoning being ""for both players new to the game and those who need a remote outpost in times of war."" doesn't really express imho the vision you are trying to put across.why do this? what makes it so cool? why will eve be a better place? what need does it fullfill?"
12/20/2008,"sure. this is meant for multiple reasons. first, it will give newer players a sense of 'ownership' in the game, breaking the restrictions of the veteran players to run and manage poses. being fuel efficient, useful, and proprietary, newer players will have a small taste of what's to come in the game, and a useful skill for later in their careers.veteran players who aren't interested in big-alliance politics will have the ability to make a remote 'outpost' to store their stuff and perform very basic functions similar to a station or pos, without being too powerful. while some basic functionality will be retained, more advanced stuff like the market and better refining will be found in stations, and moon mining and reacting will be firmly in the pos department.alliance members will have a small, functional remote location with which to perform guerrilla tactics against other alliances or as a run-to point in systems they already control. being in what could be considered a 'safe-spot', there would be greater security (especially with the cloak active), while not being indestructable.overall, everybody would benefit from these sbhs, without taking over areas which other aspects of the game already control. in unison, they'll give a vibrant and active list of options for any player of the game that has played for more than a week."
12/20/2008,no
12/20/2008,"small remote outposts (<pos) are a good idea, but i think making this ship-base hybrid is too much. not supporting, but would support some sort of small structure that costs around 50m and could be deployed from a t1 industrial. probably should be restricted to <=.4 security also, but that's a different argument."
12/20/2008,poasting in a protect the exploiters thread.
12/20/2008,qft.
12/20/2008,supporting this purely for the hilarious crying generated by the tinfoil hat brigade as they rage impotently at evil ccp and their grand moongate coverup.
12/20/2008,"hey, please understand that although you get a laugh out of us thinking the way we do; we get a real kick out of the blind faithers too."
12/20/2008,"the eula doesn't give them explicit rights to name and shame in the privacy and confidentiality clause.they could derive rights by claiming the forums a 3rd party blah blah, but i doubt they'd risk even the faintest chance at getting a lawsuit."
12/20/2008,"the eula give them explicity rights to do as they fit with the characters or anything in the game, as it clearly says that everything in eve is ccp's property.player's data is not theirs to disclose. but character's names have nothing to do with it."
12/20/2008,"""... but that's what we have other players for.""i understand why people would like to know exactly who and what. personally, i would like to know the same, if only out of curiosity. unfortunately we only need one ****ed up kid with too much time on his hands, thinking ""internetspaceships = seriuz bizniz"" to cause someone personal damage irl. i know quite a few players give 'hints' to their personal lives and information, willingly or not. look up 'k0wkilla' and 'myspace' on eve-search for an example of that. the probability of personal rl attacks may be small, but it's nevertheless existant. i'ld be interested to see peoples' reactions if such a thing were to happen, not even thinking of possible legal complications for ccp.in the end, i'ld say ccp's policies and actions are theirs. they can make and break them at their own leisure. they've stated that they don't want to disclose this information, or at least not at the time. agree or disagree, it's their call."
12/20/2008,you fail to understand the concept of a private company slade
12/20/2008,"if a player decides to disclose the personal data of another player, because this other player confided it to him it has nothing to do with ccp. it can be done at any time by anyone. ccp needs not to take any action for it to happen nor any action it takes makes a difference, especially because a player that is close enough to a cheater to know his real life information, must have close ties with the said cheater and it would be against his interests to put them in evidence..and if it is done within these forums, all ccp has to do is to take the proper punitive measures against such player (which it didn't against sirmolle i should mention when he did exactly this).you fail to understand the concept of relevant to the discussion."
12/20/2008,glad to see the humor wasn't lost. i'm having difficulty containing my laughter as well. like a parent biting their tongue trying not to laugh as their child throws a temper tantrum. daddy has to put on his serious face while little sally screams bloody murder over a cookie. it's so ridiculous.
12/20/2008,"you're taiking it all too far though. you're acting like a parent, and when the ""child"" presents a rational counter-argument you decide not to even respond. classy."
12/20/2008,"at the risk of repeating myself, we know all this. that said, it shouldn't stop any of us (supporters of this thread included) voicing their opinions and wishes, and if ccp decides not to run with it so be it - they will have weighed up the potential implications either way i'm sure."
12/20/2008,"ccp being a private company means that they have absolutely zero accountability to the player base if they so choose. they also have the right to shut down the servers with zero compensation to you for whatever reason they so choose even in the middle of your payed time for usage. if you do not understand this then you sir are the one that does not understand the situation.if you are unable to see how being private affects a companies rights to or not to disclose information then you need to read up on the operation of private vs public companies. no laws were broken therefor zero disclosure is their right. if the player base has a problem with that then start a **** storm in the regular media or on the servers, but on these boards you are preaching either to those that agree with you or those that do not, which are both only small portions of the player base.""a. by ccp for termination of the gameccp does not guarantee that it will continue to offer access to the system or support the game. ccp may, in its sole discretion, cease to provide any or all of the services offered in connection with eve (including access to the system and any or all features or components of the game), terminate the eula, close all accounts and cancel all of the rights granted to you under the eula.wrong. you must not have read the eula or understood it.""b. passwords and namesyou will be asked to select a password during the registration process (""password""). you may not disclose your password to anyone or allow anyone to use your password to access the system or play eve. you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for any damage, harm, lost or deleted characters, etc. resulting from your disclosure, or allowing the disclosure, of any password, or from use by any person of your password. you may not obtain, attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the password of anyone else.""you have made absolutely no point right here. so please do clarify what you are trying to say.assumptions with the addition of name and shame, with zero evidence. also once again ccp is a private company that owes you nothing as it has to do with.""b. rights to certain contentyou have no interest in the value of your time spent playing the game...without limiting its rights in any way, and subject to the other terms of the eula, ccp shall have the right to display and publish any information (except certain personal information in your account) relating to any character in your account, for example, in charts, lists and other compilations, without notice or any compensation to you whatsoever. ""this also implies that they do not have to hand over any information if they so choose. as i said in previous posts i would like to know the information you are trying to get, but i have no disillusions about ccp owing me this information and i am not allowing it to ruin my game play.slade"
12/20/2008,"come on guys, ccp is not an honest company, period. we know this, we've seen how past scandals were dealt with. the alliances you suspect of cheating, have cheated and are continuing to cheat. you know this.you will just have to rise above them and cause them to disintegrate in-game. look at what has become of the cheating alliances. d2, vi, mc, bob, hydra, etc.. they are but a twinkle of their former selves. eve players will see to it, and it is your duty to see to it. join the good fight against the smug cheaters, and remember to have fun along the way."
12/20/2008,"<sigh> we all get this, we know. having an opinion that ccp should release character names is not demanding that we have a right to have the character names released. in a manner of speaking, it's like any other private company; if enough customers are disatisfied with it's product or how it handles it's customer relations - they run the risk that those customers will not continue to provide revenue for them. that is how the point is made, that is how any private company will look at these kinds of situations. we know we have no 'rights' in getting the information. i'm running out of ways to actually explain this. i wonder if you have an issue with comprehension. and these forums are also owned and read by ccp right? so, in theory they should be able to gauge the satisfaction of their customers and take any feedback and... to not put too fine a point on it - do with it as they wish. that relates to passwords. account names themselves are passed to each other via the character transfer process are they not? ccp own all the in-game content, that includes the character names. once an aco**** is banned; even more so.passwords are obviously a totally different concern - rl info even more so and a breach of the eula and law. not only that, it details that if you pass on your password and suffer a loss as a result, you are liable. that's all that statement you have quoted says."
12/20/2008,"and this is exactly the part that tells you that ccp can announce the character names of the banned characters if they so choose. we understand they don't have to, we just think that in these instances, maybe they should. character names, corporations and alliances if applicable. basically, we want to be sure it's not just a bunch of alts in alt corps that got the bans. we are being told:i would love to see a full list that indicates that is likely to be the case. they are all perma-banned anyway. just to make one thing clear though. we do not want passwords, account names, rl names, addresses, phone numbers, country of residence, cc information or anything regarding the subscription. just the names of the characters that got hit with the ban."
12/20/2008,"um yeah, i'll respond to a ""rational counter-argument"" when you create one. remember, your goal is to express a genuine and legitimate need for such a list with a use other than trolling.you haven't done that yet."
12/20/2008,"i've said it before and i'll say it again...... and again... and again...because ccp never listens:make it prohibative for them to remain in npc corps!!!! limit the skills they can train and the ships they can fly. push them out of the npc corps and make them vulnerable to war declarations.make war declaration flags persist with each individual of the declared corp so jumping does not get them instant freedom from the war.yes, they'll just dock and not log in... okay! mission accomplished, a macro miner not mining is not making money for the macro user (of course, in the case of organized macro industries they have dozens of ready accounts to take up the slack...)ccp should also institute more aggressive client end snooping to determine if macro activity is affecting the client."
12/20/2008,"the thing that most people dont' know about macro miners is ccp changed the way the graphics engine works so any macro that worked off finding pixels no longer works, that put a stop to the majority of macros.what most people think are macro miners are really just people who mine a lot, i know many people who ignore local and all chats and mine for 10 hours a day. which is perfectly fine as far as ccp is concerned."

12/20/2008,hi i am ceo of anti-scam squadron and i petition spamming scammers in jita..<U+FFFD>.but it can be really enoying that there is a petion limit i can only have to petions open at a time would really like this number to be unlimitedbest regards - trode tradantine - ceo anti-scam squadron
12/20/2008,"if the petition limit would be unlimited, you'd have bots spamming the petition queues with crap, just to hide the legit petitions against them."
12/20/2008,hmm didn't think of that. but it could be raised to atleast 6 petitions per account instead of 2 per character
12/20/2008,isn't 2 per character 6 per account already ?
12/20/2008,"the problem here is with you. scamming is legit in eve, and you should not be petitioning them. if you waste your petitions on stupid ones that will fail, it's not ccp's concern when you run out. in fact, i'd wager that the petition limit is specifically aimed at people like you, who would gladly throw out 100 petitions against legitimate game mechanics they don't understand, and flood the queues to drown out the legitimate petitions. 2 stupid ones is enough for the gms to deal with, they don't need the other 98 identical petitions to wade through."
12/20/2008,"where did i ever say that i wanted a dedicated salvage boat to make more isk??? jeeze, whoever came up with that connection to my message was smoking some pretty low grade stuff.i only want a dedicated salvage boat for the efficiency of it. consider:you can use destroyers: 8 high slots, pittiful cargo space (yes, you can use the 'tow can' approach, inefficiently), and good speed.you can use battlecruisers: not a lot better than a destroyer, and much slower.you can use marauders: highly efficient salvage boats; 40km tractor range, modest cargo. but too damn expensive to be used for salvaging (ninja or otherwise). it's like using a ferrari to deliver newspapers.since salvaging is a viable profession for mission runners or ninja salvagers there needs to be a dedicated ship to suit that profession (we have specialist ships for every profession except salvaging, by the way). the industrial hull is the most logical since salvaging is not (typically) a combat oriented activity and they have the cargo capacity to make use of salvaging/looting as a profession.but no, i don't want a dedicated salvage boat to increase my isk/hour. good lord that connection was just dumb."

12/20/2008,"if after everything i wrote, answering multiple posts of different people, you could find only repetitions i am quite surprised with your abilities to find patterns, or your desire to do it.you alleged that i repeat myself. i happen to have already answered to this. you alleged that i attack everyone that is in opposition to my point of view, and i already answered this. you have neither commented on the answers nor tried to point what is wrong with them. you just did the very same questions again. please forgive me, if after repeating myself so much to answer people who did the same, i got a bit tired of it.i am here to satisfy all tastes, my friend. i can have a civilized discussion with people seeking discussion, and a flame war with those that are looking for it. it doesn't bother me in the least. and i even find the last the****utic at times.i don't try to force my opinions in anyone, as if it was even possible. people believe in what they want to believe period. but i won't stay quiet all the same when i see things that i consider worth criticizing. and if i can annoy those that are too comfortable with their status quo to think by themselves (and i am not saying in any way that you are one of them), even the better."
12/20/2008,"man, ccp must have contracted homer simpson to make this filter..."
12/20/2008,"again: i tried to state my irritation with people rehashing the same arguments over and over again. don't think i've ever said ""etho demerzel only knows 'copy' + 'paste'. must be in one of those post by myself that i didn't read.affirmative. alot of the posts rehash the same message, using the same arguments and following a similar belligerent pattern time and again.answered what? i don't think i posed any question(s)?nope. where? you do read the posts now, don't you?if by answers you mean the remarks in the op: true. my commentary was 'no to pitchforks', and abstaining from the 'thumbs-up'. i thought this would be clear as to my opinion on the matter. especially as this was posted in the assembly hall, and not in the speakers' corner, where it would (should?) have been posted if you wanted a / more discussion. not that there's no discussion in this thread, but hey. if by answers you meant something else - enlighten me.understandable that you got tired after admittedly repeating yourself that much, but honestly - which question(s) did i pose?hearhear.thought so. i know how that worksnot sure if everyone would agree to that.as true as it gets.very commendable depending on the type of noise you make. i was always tought to think and gather information before i spoke. to each his own.not entirely sure what you're trying to say here, or who you're adressing. what status-quo? and, willfully annoying people just for your own 'therapy'? you can obviously think for yourself, but this statement would lead people to believe that you have a certain disdain towards anyone that doesn't think like you .oh well, internet arguments, special olympics and all that stuff..."
12/20/2008,"not only for the filter, judging by the way the forums often (don't) work"
12/20/2008,would you accept training at half sp rate as you training two characters ?
12/20/2008,"this was implemented by ccp to reduce the effects of character farming. this will not be changed.name one other game that allows simultaneous training of multiple characters on one account. i know of none. if you want additional pilots then earn the isk and buy a character for each additional slot or open a second account and try other professions. i myself choose to spread my skills out and try other things and be a jack of all trades. sure i have gimped my skills a bit, but i balanced that by not going after the larger ships till later in my eve career. one plus years on the servers and i still do not own the bs skill book. slade"
12/20/2008,"i wouldn't agree with 1/2 but yes, i would take a sp rate reduction to be able to train two characters at once. even though, i think the skill progression in eve is extremely long as it is. (see below)other mmo's dont allow you to train two characters at once but then again their character progression doesn't take nearly as long as building up a skill set does it does in eve.i'm finding to get get to a decent level of proficiency in eve, in a specific set of skills (ie. exploration, missiles, gunnery, mining, support roles) can take anywhere from 5 - 8 months. that's not even maxing all of the skills in most cases.i don't think that's a bad thing all together. i think it makes you quite attached to your toon for the investment you've had to put into it. to be honest, skill training currently takes as long as it does now just for the purpose you mention above.ccp want's to force you to buy a second account just for the revenue stream.i understand it's a business sure.but you know what. with one account on everquest and wow i've got multiple characters that i was able to level up to point's where i could play the different classes and it wouldn't take me two years per character to do it.i saw a post in the forums somewhere that said 80% of new players quit eve within 8 months.i think this is a big part of it. (coupled with the fact it takes 2 1/2 - 5 months just to train your learning skills to a sufficient level to learn your other skils faster to reach the level i feel they should be at a minimum 4/4 - 5/5)it's no wonder most new players don't want to stick around.most people don't have that type of long term mentality. (it is an instant gratification society we live in anymore afterall.heck, i've had one character that i've used in the old d&d games that i've played for 15 years regularly. (also note, i think here that all of the new rules progress these characters way to quickly!)just my thought's. let the flames begin.p.s the way most new characters get blasted whenever they ask or suggest anything is another reason i don't think they hang around. this can be one nasty! environment for new players!i've been around awhile and i can take it, i'm old, fat, stubborn as all hell and thick headed. ooopps i mean skinned!p.p.s - i have 4 account's i pay for to try different things.p.p.p.s - i don't get the chance to play eve enough to pay for all of them with isk because i work a 60 hour/week job and have my own business on the side.safe flying and check-6."
12/20/2008,"if you want an elitist forum, go create your own. eve-online forums are for everyone who plays the game."
12/20/2008,"not sure if you read the rest of the post, but this has nothing to do with me wanting, and has everything to do with ccp finally declaring where such topics should be discussed.it's pretty simple request here, there will always be discussion on people offering up some sort of investment opportunity. the newer members of the forum state that market discussion is not where this type of discussion takes place. it boils down to, ccp have no defined a location for this.all that needs to happen is ccp officially declare any ""secondary market"" discussion should take place in the ""market discussion"" forum or ccp create a new forums and declare that the location. you suggest creation of your privately run forum, i'm willing to add that to the list. third option, ccp declare that this type of discussion has no place on the eve-online forum and should be taken elsewhere.nothing to do with elitism, but everything to do with ccp helping the moderators and the eve player base out by telling everyone where this type of discussion should take place.so now the proposal is for one of the following to happen.1) ccp create a forums for this type of discussion2) ccp help the moderators, and eve player base by declaring the following2a) the market discussion forum is the place for this type of discussion2b) there is no place on the eve-online forum that is welcome for this type of discussion, and such a forum should exist outside the boundaries of ccp's control."
12/20/2008,"i like, except for the name. ""secondary market discussion"" does not work well with what you are envisioning; after all, the secondary market is for resale and trade of existing stocks and bonds, not for issuing new ones. in eve, the primary investment market (stocks and bonds sold in the md forum etc) is much larger than the secondary market (trading those stocks and bonds once they've been purchased).other than that, yes."
12/20/2008,"replace all sentry guns in low-sec and high-sec space with a concord sentry gun variant.concord sentry guns should be capable of 100x the dps of regular sentries, and thus put an end to pirates who tank gate-guns."
12/20/2008,"a better topic title would be ""remove pirates from low sec""."
12/20/2008,i don't think you understand what i'm saying. this is all about removing gate-tankers.
12/20/2008,obvious troll is obvious.
12/20/2008,"i think a better idea would be place all lvl 4 agents in low sec, this way there will be a lot of armed misisoners ready to pop the cowardly piwates waiting on gates for the haulers and shuttles. this would really clean up low sec and make it a safe haven for the faction fit bs's doing missions."
12/20/2008,"i like this idea.please remember to support my idea of a automated system were all systems that get more then 50 ppl in local at any given time turns into a 0,0 system for the following 24 hours"
12/20/2008,"if you combine my idea with yours, we can create a thunderdrome"
12/20/2008,op fails. this would put a stop to gatecamps... sure... but pirates could still get you in missions or in belts... so it fails.you're just butthurt because low sec is so empty as it is. why? because it's overfished.that's why we need to get rid of sentry guns in low sec. create a concord faction spawn. one dialed in for exactly the same dps as the gate guns... who function exactly like faction navy in fail warfare high sec.
12/20/2008,"op doesn't fail. pirates in low-sec are supposed to get you in missions and in belts. they're not supposed to get you at gates and stations-- at least that seems to be the designer's intent by putting sentry guns there. unfortunately the sentry guns are easily tanked, and thus the designer's intent is easily exploitable."
12/20/2008,"as ""biased"" as the op is... i have to agree....there's no reason to have gate sentries if they are ineffective.either remove them... or buff them.no one should be able to tank such things... as tanking concord let alone navy forces in high sec tends to be frowned upon by ccp.seem's kinda contradictory otherwise."
12/20/2008,"is that mont sant michele (sp?) in the background? i've been there, it's a beautiful place. anyway, yes. i'd say that most of the time, gatecamps are easy to avoid by going a different way. i'd personally prefer for lowsec to be dangerous less at gates/stations but more in between, but what can you do..."
12/20/2008,"i understand what you're getting at, op, but i do not believe this is a good solution. i believe better game mechanics are needed for pirates so they don't have a need for turret tanking."
12/20/2008,"i find that when browsing the market window, it can be verry frustrating to scroll an entire page down or have to collapse each tab separatly in order to tidy the display. what is needed is one button that automaticaly collapses all tabs so that they appear as they did when you started the game."
12/20/2008,"i think the answer to this mess, and piracy in general, is to increase effective dps of all sentry guns by 100 fold.in fact, they should all be replaced by a concord sentry gun variant.such measures would put an end to pirates who tank gate-guns."
12/20/2008,nutshell version?-perceived problem-goal-general idea
12/20/2008,"right. -perceived problem even though the black ops class looks on paper to be a type of ship that any fighter pilot would want to at least sit in, they are in fact currently underused due to (in my opinion) general lack of speciality in any area. -goalchange the ships' bonuses to better suit eve mechanics. -general ideato gather ideas and support from player community for a possible change of this class to something that would better fit the bs sized niche of recons / eafs."
12/20/2008,well that post was a painful read.
12/20/2008,"so will their questions be answered in your iceland meeting? also, it's not like any of them have left the game, could not ccp get answers to the old csm even after the new csm has taken office?"

12/21/2008,"i would prefer a no-skill, no-item sollution though. why can't you try to re-establish contact with the drone once you are back withing drone control range? once that happens the drones will automatically return and orbit. anyways, just a thought."
12/21/2008,supported
12/21/2008,"very much supported, especially since i've been having nasty issues with drones lately. i recall all 5 to my drone bay...2 of them actually make it, and the other 3 drop off my drone context menu, so i have to slowboat and manually scoop them, which really sucks if i've recalled them because they've pulled aggro :/"
12/21/2008,"i don't believe it should even be a skill, if you disconnect or warp away and leave your drones in space they should be owned by you. if you come back within lets say 15 minutes as long as they are within your drone control range you can restablish control over them unless they we're scooped to someone elses drone bay."
12/21/2008,great idea
12/21/2008,"this, keep training to v or web interface for switching skills"
12/21/2008,signed. public vetting of exploiters is necessary to give us the ability to independently verify that characters did exist and were booted. somebody knew these people after all; and a flood of alts would only demonstrate that the alt system may need attention.

12/21/2008,"as a fairly new player, i think the idea of punishing or kicking people out of the noob corps is horrible. the advice of some of the 1 or 2 year old players has been very helpful in smoothing the insane learning curve this game has. having noob corps with experienced players in them is a good thing. if there is a problem with the wardec system, change it, but this idea seems pretty ******ed."
12/21/2008,"i support this purely because ci is a great poster, her sig looks out of place and because her corpname now lacks a little meaning."
12/21/2008,"i don't believe this outweighs the inconvenience and skill point loss caused by the current system. if this is a point relating to the fact that talking with your mates encourages you to play, there is a solution to the issue. expand some of the chat fuctionality to outside playing the game. some type of messanger like system. this would separate the skill system entirely from the activity of the players and expand the area of social pressure you want players to put on their mates. this way i can chat whatever with my corp/buddies even when doing something else, they can say if something worth logging on is happening and skill queue doesn't have to buried because of your concerns. players get a skill queue, the social networking grows stronger and ccp get more active subscribers."

12/21/2008,"earlier this week a barge was mining ice in the ice belt (yeah, go figure!). some npc pirates came along and attacked the barge, resulting in it's destruction. the pod kept going back and forth between the ice field and the station. this was 100% certain a macro miner. no way a player would just go back and forth in his pod to sit at the ice field.while i do agree that a lot of people are actually mining without paying attention to local, there are a lot of macro miners in ice belts as well. typical signs include random character names, noob corps and being on 23/7."

12/21/2008,thank you =)
12/21/2008,"recently e-war was changed so that you could see what e-war was being applied to you on the overview. that's certainly handy, but i want ccp to go one step further, and make any e-war applied to you, visible on everybody else's overview. this includes not only the 4 racial types of e-war, but also warp jamming, stasis webbing, neuting, basically any effect that can be applied to an enemy ship.for now, let's look at this in the fleet context. no longer will ts be a mish-mash of tacklers calling hard-to-pronounce names on teamspeak, those without a mic typing their points into fleet in the vain hope that someone will notice, and an all-around cluster****. when an enemy ship is pointed, the fc should quickly notice on his overview and call it primary.it's not just easier for the fc, either. tacklers won't be required to have a mic any more. it will also be even easier to avoid accidentally pointing/webbing targets already tackled, and generally making the entire experience less confusing and more fun, especially for newer players.it's also beneficial for e-war. targets who are jammed, sensor dampened, or tracking disrupted can be ignored as primaries, as they do not currently present a threat to the fleet. this way a fleet can utilise its e-war ships more effectively to shut down the enemy fleet's dps in short order.let's not forget the black sheep of the e-war family. target painting can finally become a useful form of e-war, and at the same time bring ravens and other dps missile ships to the forefront of fleet combat once again. it has already been proven that the raven has extremely strong dps and it's missile flight time can be whittled down to under 15 seconds for typical sniper range with good skills. however fleet battles are about large amounts of ships combining their fire, and there is currently no easy way for raven pilots to do this, leaving them forced to picking on random battleships and forcing them to warp out, only able to score kills when dictor bubbles go down. but if a ship that was target painted was to appear as such on everyone else's overview, this would give missile ships a target to focus their fire at. not only that but the effect of the target painting would enable them to use fury missiles, with which a 3-bcs raven with maxed missile skills and bs5, will deal nearly 600dps with at 230km.i know i make little secret of my affection for ravens and missiles in general, but this suggestion while not only improving the user interface and the experience of fleet battles for the general membership of eve, will also buff two heavily maligned types of pvp in fleet scenario, namely missiles and target painting. target painting stops being useless when everyone can see who is painted, and missiles stop being useless when they have a way to focus their fire on a ""missile primary"", as it were. the end result is a bigger variety of options in the type of ship you can bring to fleet combat.other bonuses of this change would include ewar ships not accidentally using their e-war on an already-disabled target and many other minor changes mainly relating to the user experience. at the end of the day it is simply giving the player more information about the fighting taking place around them, enabling them to make more informed decisions.however this could possibly bring game inbalance. would ravens need a nerf following this change? does e-war, especially ecm, really need another buff? obviously not. this change can't be thrown out on its own, it needs to be implemented along with a very large overhaul on everything to do with fleet combat.fleet combat is finally playable in terms of lag. that hurdle is cleared. let's now approach it in other ways."
12/21/2008,"currently, medals can only be awarded to people in the exact same corporation. this has the effect that people in alliances have to recreate their medals in each and every corp belonging to that alliance, instead of just creating them once, causing clutter and costing isk.it is also impossible to award individuals outside of the corp, for example, mercenaries or people that came to aid in a dire situation.it should be possible to award medals without corp restrictions."
12/21/2008,"does not really cause a lot of clutter, each corp just makes a medal so cost is only the cost of creating a medal for each corp. this would in fact cause more c;utter and cost as corps would have to make extra medals if they feel the need to hand out to non corp members. mercs do not need medals given as they get paid for it, in any case the corp or alliance be advertising the fact they hired them and that defeats one aspect of hireing mercs."
12/21/2008,veldspar medals for everyone!
12/21/2008,"in addition to this, if youre taking medals to csm would you take another adjustment?allow ribbons to be issued in addition to medals.stuff like long term campaigns, epic battles, notable losses () and so on that dont so much merit a medal would be served well with a 'lesser' recognition.should be too hard to implement id have thought,"

12/21/2008,"another medal topic, i'm kinda fond of those things. anyway, ccp had a nice ingame event, where players had to capture the kourmonen system. afterwards the gm staff granted a medal, nice touch and all.what i'd like to see is that ccp would make this granting of medals easier. so they have a system where they can set the automatic granting of medals through ingame events. for example, if that caldari titan in luminaire finally gets destroyed, everyone that caused damage to it instantly gets a medal. a smaller medal can be granted to all that participate in capturing control bunkers. it can also be expanded to the new huge storyline missions which we'll get next year, and live events organized by gms.the next step would be to make these tools available to corps and alliances. so that directors can set conditions that grants medals. for kills, i'd say give it a menu with the following criteria:* amount of kills required* individual/corp/alliance the kill belonged to* minimal ship class of killso that people can automatically get a medal if they destroy 50 enemy ships, and a different if they participate in bringing down an enemy titan, for example.please discuss."

12/21/2008,"i've read the pdf file and reread it twice more.a few concerns come to mind. first is the profitability of bounty hunting. the risk vs reward vs time ratio comes creeping up. to me it just doesn't seem like the risk and time required is worth the reward. especially if said bounty target is a drifter. second is the anti griefing measures put forth in the pdf seem a bit sketchy and undefined. habitual griefers, despite their reputation, are rather clever and i fear they will find a workaround to misuse the system. newbie victims of can baiting come to mind. my third concern is the ability to ""track"" down bounty targets. mainly for its alternative uses, specifically against enemy alliances. what an incredible advantage it would be if your alliance could track enemy alliance movements.i do like the idea though and believe it does have merit. i would like to see npc bounty hunters for hire."
12/21/2008,"supported, although i object to the proposal solving the problems with the current system. say a player with significant bounty and an insured battleship has a buddy in his alliance who is a bounty hunter. the fact that, in the proposed system, only a part of the bounty proportionate to the loss is payed, the possibility of abuse in this scenario isn't great but it is still present - given an appropriately high bounty, the possibility of that player indirectly claiming the bounty is still present. anyway, i'm nitpicking."
12/21/2008,"i was actually thinking about this the other day, the main thing i can think of is would it really be viable to the griever, say you just got killed you lose ""x"" amount of isk, you want to get back at the guy so you put ""x"" amount of isk. in my mind the bounty will probably not go over the price of their loss, at which point it isn't profitable to the bounty hunter...this may sound odd but what if you could instead give your kill rights to the concord and so they could process the bounty based on how much the grievers ship was worth multiplied by a variable of the pirates -security status. we already see this on npc pirates, so why couldn't they simple apply a bounty system based on how many people turn in the kill rights to concord...say said pirate has 20 confirmed kills his bounty would be worth more. for storyline sake you could also say that the concord is employing bounty hunters to help with the pirating problem in low sec so a certain reward is offered for their heads?i think that would fix the profit problem for bounty hunters and make it more worth their time. though with the added attention and way to profit off pirates you'd need a method for pirates to make some kind of profit or maybe to prevent them from killing themselves with a friend/alt give them a perk for keeping their security status...and maybe if they get killed by a ""bounty hunter"" their security status goes up (as in from -5.00 to -4.50) and as it goes further away from low security they lose that perk. being it that only hunters can claim the bounty with the plan you made, mixed with the fact that the pirates gets a perk for having low status means he probably won't want to kill himself to get the bounty if it means losing x amount of sec status."

12/21/2008,"although i laughed out loud literally at this, i have to say you may not have understood the point of the request.it has nothing to do with elitists or even a private forum or a place only intellectual talk. if you've been reading the market discussion forum there is a clear misunderstanding as to what that forum is meant to be for. even the moderators are having a difficult time moderating this particular forum. moving posts back and forth because the topics discussed in there just don't have a place anywhere else.there is a growing group of people who believe ipo and public corporations like ebank, dbank, bsa, bmbe, are not meant to be part of that forum.the most logical solution is to make the loudest voice happy and create a sub forum for that type of discussion and remove it from the market discussion forum, making them happy.however as some have noted in here, that is not needed. so the next most logical solution is to have ccp come forth and public declare the market discussion forum is where public companies that sell shares and bonds is where that happens. this is what this particular forum has been used for, for years now. so nothing changes just ccp define what this forum is meant to be for.the last solution is probably one ccp would never do, declare all ipo/public companies do not belong on eve-online forum. however i fear that would create more problems then solutions for ccp.thanks for the great read though it was enjoyable."
12/21/2008,"you are an idiot, as long as local exists gate camps is the best way to catch people."
12/21/2008,"i disagree-- people will put up gate camps with or without local. but i have to agree about removing local, or at least ""opting out"" of local by not talking (which is something you should do)."
12/21/2008,"that's not how it's supposed to work at all. gate guns are there as a disincentive, that's all. you can tank them, but then you have to use a different type of pvp setup, or you have to do something else to deal with them. this thread seems to be operating on the principle that everything not mandatory ought to be forbidden, and that's terrible game design. the guns are fine."
12/21/2008,this doesnt make much sense - you want logistics to be on km as one of the party involved in killing what they faild to repair ? not supported.
12/21/2008,"no, read the thread(and the links)."
12/21/2008,"how does the current killmail system give you information that you couldn't already get from combat logs? killmails let you know how much damage was dealt and what weapon was used. you can already see that information when it happens, the killmail is just an archived summary of what you should already know.list of current data fields on killmails.victim: corp-alliance-faction-destroyed (shiptype)-system-security-damage takeninvolved parties: name-security-corp-alliance-faction-ship-weapon-damage donenothing here can't be determined without the killmail. adding logistics would change that."
12/22/2008,"this belongs on page one, and someone from the csm needs to take it back to ccp, it wasn't really even talked about last time, it was kind of mentioned, then it was the funky pos idea, bring the subject up, straight forward, push the idea, make it a major topic not a minor one, and maybe ccp will rethink there position on this.if it at least looks like the csm had tried to work it in last time i would just leave it alone with ccp's last answer, but as it is, those guys pretty much avoided it, with ""no reason to talk about something due to ccps answer."" this csm needs to push this idea, its something that pos management teams want, and no we are not going to get a 10% of the forums vote for support, there are to few of us that setup and run them for that, but it effects thousands of people in game."

12/22/2008,"i haven't read the entire thread, so this may or may not have been stated. missiles have not been nerfed as much as you think.explosion velocity now matters less. the mechanics have changed completely, there's a thread with all the maths on it that talks about this. what matters now is the combination of speed and sig radius. if the sig radius is too high, the velocity bonus won't help with damage tanking much. to cruise missiles, yes, this may mean that you do less damage to a moving target. maybe that part needs to be changed. however, what you're missing is the ""damage reduction factor"". you're whining about how explosion velocity has been nerfed, but completely ignoring the fact that there's a new stat to consider. maybe you passed it off as insignificant, but, i assure you, it means a hell of a lot.what does this ""nerf"" mean?a flycatcher with t2 precisions can now damage an inty! it can actually fulfill its secondary role! imagine that! and, believe it or not, the damage is actually respectable! if the inty turns on the mwd, it can't go fast enough anymore, unless it's incredibly expensive, to outrun the damage. if it can go over 8k.s-1, then yeah, it'll probably just outrun the missile, but when it gets hit by the missile, the damage will probably only be about half the full potential. this is much better than before, where you simply couldn't get the explosion velocity high enough to do respectable damage to anything that moved over 3-4k.s-1. so yeah, maybe your ravens got nerfed. whine about that, please. but don't bring it back to what it was. a lot of ships have benefited from this. you'll either have to adapt to the changes (and mothball your raven, or have fun with new fitting ideas), or you can continue to petition, if you really think it's that broken. but remember, eve is an mmo, keyword being multiplayer. yes, i fly caldari. yes, i have a raven. yes, i have also invested a decent amount of sp into missiles, and plan to invest more.get all the facts before calling the end of the world, please. p.s. want to repeat again that this is actually a boost, not a nerf. just thought i'd restate that. look beyond the explosion velocity."

12/22/2008,this.
12/22/2008,"firstly, i would like to point to an already open thread in another location hereit has been discussed, complained about and been a problem in eve for a very long time. that is of course server lag during large scale engagements.although this is a serious problem for countless players there are few solutions to the grand scale of the problem.however, a suggestion has been discussed by a fair few people of a way to atleast improve the issue significantly to some degree.additional ""server nodes"" as i am told they are named can be assigned to areas where a fleet engagement is scheduled to go down.if this can be done then i suggest a very simple solution.why does this not occur to four systems on a permanent basis, one per faction.many fleet engagements between the caldari & gallente occur in old man star and tama. both systems are directly adjacent to the relevant factions ""high sec""if more nodes where provided for these systems plus the matari & amarrian equivalents then we would finally have a location more suited for large scale pvp fleet action.it may not solve the entire problem, however it does add a significant improvement to the situation and gives all four houses a location each in which they can martial full scale pvp at any time without crippled lag taking away their hard earned isk needlessly.most people in faction war and pvp in general have no discontent about loosing assets when it is under proper circumstances. circumstances we pay for every two months. but to loose so much because of a server side failing? then have not even having reimbursement i belive is unreasonable to any person in this game in any profession.please, add more nodes to one system per faction.- thankyou,- kane kuchera"
12/22/2008,much support to this
12/22/2008,i concur with kane
12/22/2008,w0rd... this should be done
12/22/2008,"agree completely. fw will suffer if this area is not improved - it is after all a more 'casual' style of play, and people will just 'casually' leave if this keeps happening."
12/22/2008,fw has already sufferd alot because of this problem. this ma just bring the enthusiams back for alot of people. certainly for me.
12/22/2008,"full support, fw is suffering severely from this problem, and the fact that resonable solutions are being brought forward should not be ignored. needless lag should not be ignored any longer."
12/22/2008,completely agree
12/22/2008,"i agree, i just hope it works. right now fw is worthless."
12/22/2008,i fully support the idea.
12/22/2008,i agree to.

12/22/2008,i support this
12/22/2008,cmon ccp
12/22/2008,"supporting.i like the idea of a mini-post. 5000 systems is a big place to find your pod currently exploring. sometimes overzealous flying/exploring can leave far from ""home"" but you want to stay awhile and see what's around. unpack and pack back up again in an industrial sized ship (bring along a frigate packed inside too)is a good idea."
12/22/2008,"surly worth discussing. it see to tie well with the future expansion of the exploration system. jumping through a wormhole with an exploration ship capable of being deployed as a limited function pos seem a interesting idea, especially if it had some ""special"" exploration function working only when in ""mini-base"" mode. would like to see some number on the theoretical chance of being detected on a long range probe with the cloak on. i suspect that a reduction to a 20% chance of the starting value will still allow it to be detected in 1-2 passes. it all depend on ship size and base sensor strength."
12/22/2008,"i like history. i like the recording of history to be accurate. if an alliance had an impact on the history of the eve universe--while taking advantage of the exploit--i want to know. i want the asterisk in the history.a list of names won't change the actual events, but it will change the narrative of those events."
12/22/2008,"ccp already said they were thinking of revising ecm/eccm.the other day we tried a setup with a recon with 2 eccm and on a bs 2 remote eccm and got up to 200 sensor strenght. the falcon got 1 out of 3 score. have more remote eccm and falcon still has a chance of getting off one cycle.falcons are nice ships but they way they can use their bonuses caused the rock, paper, scissors to get skewed. eccm should be able to negate it but currently its not."
12/22/2008,"yes if someone decides to increase their resistance to falcons, having to sacrifice a medium or low slot can be painful. it should be a worthwhile sacrifice. doesn't have to be a huge boost either, say, 15%-25%."
12/22/2008,"we already have visual effects to show when a target is neuted or webbed. i can't imagine it would be hard to add little icons next to the ship to show it's current status in relation to e-war (jammed, scrambled, damped, etc).signed."
12/22/2008,"this is an interesting proposal, but i don't think it's a particularly good idea to just change it. at present, the ewar notifications have the real advantage of telling you at a glance what you're being hit with. if it shows what they're firing instead, it means you go back to the old system of having a bar of unspecified effect and having to guess whether it's a td, sd, tp, or what. that's not a good thing. perhaps make it an option, perhaps make it tied into the fc position, but don't ignore the advantages of the current system in an attempt to get new ones. it should be looked at, but be careful."
12/22/2008,i keep all effects turned off...this proposal would be very helpful.
12/22/2008,"the best difference this makes is that you don't have to turn on effects and then squint at your screen to try and make out which vague squiggly beam effect is the warp scrambler, and this can only be a good thing.edit: heh forgot to thumbs up"
12/22/2008,yes.edit: would this include logistics too?
12/22/2008,"i think bumping should take into consideration the mass of the objects, the energy they are expending to move themselves, and their structural integrity.i.e.: a fly travelling at 3km/s is not going to bump a truck doing 100km/h, it's not going to affect it's course and it's going to hurt it self very badly"
12/22/2008,"i agree with earlyer statment, a frigate would in reality go ""splat"" on the sheild/armour not bump the thing a few thousend kms out into space, same with other large ships getting bumped by tiny ships such as frigs and intercepters"
12/22/2008,"if i poked a needly into your behind, won't you move?same concept"
12/22/2008,"too exploitable. whats stopping you from giving the leader of the corp you are at war with a medal that says ""grade a ***hole"""
12/22/2008,the fact that the receiver can trash/not display it and you wasted your money.
12/22/2008,"it's actually a valid point. i don't want to get spammed with medals from some random guy with a corp and lots of extra cash on hand. also, what if during a huge fleet fight, we send lots and lots of medals to another alliance to create some extra lag from all the character sheet notifications?a fair compromise would be to allow the executor corp to give out medals to anyone in an alliance (or some other alliance-wide system), but i never want to be in the position where every time i log on i need to delete all the medals i don't want from <pilot> in <corp>.also, wasting money is a moot point. look at random suicide ganking - to the aggressor it's not a waste of money if the they gains some satisfaction from annoying their victim, although some may consider it a waste. there are lots of people who would have no fiscal issues spending 5m isk a day on giving the same medal to the same person."
12/22/2008,"then delay the notification by a week or so to prevent this happening. if they can know that you will be in a major battle a week in advance, you have other problems you need to worry about.but there could be a random delay of up to a week added on after the first week to make that even less likely."
12/22/2008,"still doesn't fix daily spam. mustering up 5m isk to daily spam one person takes a maximum 30 minutes of ratting, and even less for a market trader with a grudge. i really feel that the ease of abuse outweighs the advantage.however i have a solution. combine the non-corp medals with a benchmarked contract system, that way medal recipients cannot be so random. if you could ensure that unwanted medals could not be given, i'd probably change my mind. otherwise i'm dead against it."
12/22/2008,"oh no, people can spam you with eve-mail. let's remove eve-mail too. if there is actual recurring spam, then petition it and the offender gets a warning/ban. and iirc the medals can be set to not be displayed by default so... (and if that can't be set, then it can be added)"
12/22/2008,good suggestion
12/22/2008,no thank you.can you imagine the number of arse of the day/week or whatever there will be made?
12/22/2008,playboy bunnies for everyone :)
12/22/2008,yea medals for everyone...erm and chribba!
12/22/2008,"wouldnt this mean everyone and anyone would have medals for everything and anything, therefore making the whole ""medal of achievement"" a bit... pointlessexample 1;character a has 2 hard earned medals for acts of valour within a corporation.character b has 2 medals given by non-corp members for helping someone destroy a rat.whats the benefit of giving medals within a corporation in the above case, they dont mean anything more than the medals given by the non-corp player.example 2;a corporation spends time and isk on setting up achievements/medals perfectly for there corporation members, whats to stop someone (maybe even there own alt) giving the corporation members medals that supercede the ones issued by the ceo.ceo says ""if you help in this war i'll give you a medal""player says ""how about i get my alt in another corporation to remake that medal and give it to myself?""ceo says ""how about we dont bother with medals after all""i get the op's point and its a good idea, but this is an mmorpg you got to figure on people abusing this mechanic."
12/22/2008,"the medals cost 10 million, so it's unlikely that people will hand out loads to people they don't know. and medals do not really have any value by themselves, it's all what the players see in it.the medal shows which corp has awarded it, so it's extremely easy to spot medals handed out by fraud inc."
12/22/2008,"yes, of course"
12/22/2008,"yes, more information for everyone. i think this is a feature really needed"

12/22/2008,...idea sold
12/22/2008,"because the time it takes to unanchor all of the modules is just plain stupid as it is now. you can only anchor 1 item at a time, and each item takes 10 minutes (or more). with a large tower you can spend 4-6 hours just sitting there trying to unanchor all of the crap.it's easier to just blow up the tower, or do like i just did... abandon it in place and let people get frustrated trying to use the moon it's sitting at until they get enough people together to blow it up (and take the sec hit for each and every module they blow up).ccp needs to repair the idiotic pos mechanics & logistics."
12/22/2008,mind saying how we should fix it?
12/22/2008,"yes.get rid of the 1-item limit. allow people to unanchor as many items as they have anchoring skill, and let more than 1 person unanchor items.limit the anchoring to prevent pos spam, but removing them should be a much, much easier affair. otherwise people do what i just did... abandon 1+ bil worth of faction crap because of the pointlessness of waiting for 1 item at a time.or, let the owner unanchor the tower and unanchor the gear around it afterward under the existing mechanic (60 seconds per item, no limit to the number of items being unanchored).there have been multiple threads on the utterly mindlessness behind pos managment (fueling, erecting & disassembling, ect). unfortunately adding to them does not increase the visibility of the issue. making more threads doesn't either, but it's easier than finding where they've been buried (or locked)."
12/22/2008,"oh, and i went back to the offlined tower to bring it back online and try to remove some equipment...but it says i have to fuel it to online it, but it won't let me fuel it because it's offline.wtf???"
12/22/2008,i thought i remembered someone creating a thread that had a cool idea on how to solve this.can't find it though. and this current csm is a lame duck already so i don't think it matters.
12/22/2008,"make it possible for everyone to unanchor offlined towers. then everybody will be interested in cleaning up the space, to scoop the towers and sell for profit"
12/22/2008,"there has been the issue of using local as an intel tool. my solution to this is to make local optional. if you want to see local then you get to be seen in local, if you don't want to be seen in local, then you don't get to see other people in local.this would be good because it would mean that an alliance can sneak a covert ops ship behind enemy lines and drop a cyno then surprise pwn an enemy system.like it? don't like it? something to add?"
12/22/2008,"sure, let carebears have another ship, maybe a tier 3 transport."
12/22/2008,"i was going to support this at first, but, meh, it isn't really necessary. the whole point of customizable fittings is that you can *make* a salvagemobile, by fitting a ship that has base strengths that are good for salvaging and then fitting it properly. asking for a specialized ship for every situation just goes against the spirit of the game.i mean, think about it, is this what you really want developer time spent on (especially making *four* essentially dissimilar salvage ships, just so each race can feel special)? a salvagemobile? what is next? you enjoy bumping so you want a ship with bump bonuses? going fast for races is what you find fun, so how about a ship with no high slots and lots of speed that can't fit non-speed modules?build one yourself, with the bajillion materials the game has given you, that is half the fun."
12/22/2008,"build my own... oh, sure, have done so. so has everyone else. they're called destroyers (you know, combat ships?) or battlecruisers, or even *gasp* marauders.they all have a single glaring fault... pitiable cargo space. marauders go a long way toward remedying this but considering they were intended to operate deep in hostile space for extenderd periods their cargo bays are painfully small.we've got industrials, which are non-combat ships. they would be the ideal platform (t1 or t2) to provide serviceable salvage ships for less than the cost of a single destroyer or much less a marauder.comparing it to a rather broken mechanic (bumping) is pretty idiotic. salvaging was introduced as a profession, so give the professionals a ship they can use (they've done it for every other profession introduced to the game by the designers)."
12/22/2008,"welp, a cyclone or a hurricane with salvage rigs and t2 cargo expanders can be a pretty effective salvager. coupled with a marauder, i'm not sure a dedicated salvager is needed."
12/22/2008,"signed.as a side note, what about salvage drones? be pretty cool. would fit in with a certain salvage orientated chronicle that was a while back."
12/22/2008,ok how about supporting it then to just get rid of the time you spend flying into and outta ranges of wrecks? if you will earn the same isk/hour why not support if it gets rid of the annoyance factor.
12/22/2008,i fixed it for you.
12/22/2008,"i've salvaged in teams of destroyers with tow-cans and an industrial. only needs two people. two.if you want to accomplish this with one person, it should be costly. every time these specialized ships are proposed, it boils down to enabling solo players accomplish what only groups can do. this salvaging ship would be a multi-role ship if it could claw, salvage, and haul - and if it was cheap like requested it would eliminate the need for teamwork.solo play has its place in this game and i know lots of people want to do more with one account, but eventually a line has to be drawn. there's a reason that other multi-role ships (marauders, black ops, command ships, orca) are so expensive."
12/22/2008,"agreed, like the part of a corp/alliance auto-giving medals."
12/22/2008,"as long as there's some fail safe so that corps that run out of cash can't give the medal. along similar lines, i'd love to see a corp that sets low benchmarks for medals, and then promptly goes bankrupt from automatically handing them out.no real potential for abuse as the corp tools would be use-at-own-risk, so +1."

12/22/2008,"the gist of the proposal is that security status determines yield, rather than availability. however, without regional differences in ore availability, there's no need for mass transport of goods. it's been mentioned over and over, but i think the devs prefer that regional resource trade remain in the game for economic complexity (a good thing).if a system was implemented where both sec status and location determined both yield and availability, i'd like that idea. the farther you are from market hubs, there should be both rarer and richer ores."
12/22/2008,"uhhhh... can i have what yer smokin, bunyip? i mean, there is insane quantities of veldspar in nullsec. my gawds there are moon sized roids of the stuff! not to mention hauler spawns dropping tens of millions of units of trit/pyer and other minerals.nothing short of removing wandering ganks will coax carebears out of highsec into the untenable ventures of lowsec. finding a sweet gravi belt in lowsec is hardly fun when the wandering ganks can find your ship in 1/1000th the time you spent finding the gravi (being in the gravi zone does not reduce your sig enough to provide even a modicum of protection from being probed out in less than 3 minutes). and mining in an actual lowsec belt is 100% sheer suicide... no matter what kind of ore you stick there no one will mine it short of massive blobs (that will be cross-blobbed in less than 30 minutes by wandering ganks).simply put, there is no way to defend your mining operation in lowsec as you can in nullsec. you can't claim sov, can't anchor defenses, can't do anything but stay aligned and warp out every time a new face enters local.i am npt espousing that lowsec be made 'safe' by any means... but ccp needs to look at how a miner (or small group, or blob) can survive the wandering pirates that would make short work of any mining ship they run across. make it easier for them to evade, or more difficult to be found by, wandering pirates and they'll be on much the same level as heavily sov'd nullsec. a hungry pirate willing to be patient can find them, sure... but right now no patience is required, just warp belt to belt or scan from a planet and voila, easy kill."

12/22/2008,"to the attention of the csm, eve community, and ccp:it has become my concern, that the eve online user client lacks sufficient audio control to enable a friendlier user environment. my primary point of contention is a lack of controls for the eve voice panel. having the audio coming in over the eve voice channel set to a single level at this time, requires a rebalancing of all other audio levels, as the only way to remedy this, is by turning up the master volume of the computer system. this leads into the second point; this lack of audio control reveals itself further with station audio, lasers, etc. there are no controls in the audio control panel to adjust the levels of these sound-fx. i would like to have this concern brought to ccp in the hopes of having a featured audio panel built into the client to allow for a greater range of control over the audio of eve. as of this time, i have been relegated to running eve with the audio disabled due to difficulty affixing the audio in such a manner conducive to play. i can understand that this may not be a primary concern for most, but regardless, its a shame to the audio engineers who put in the time to design the music, and sfx of eve, only to have a player base largely ignoring them. thank you for your time in this matter,arc dlandrus"
12/22/2008,"most of the sound effects in this game have been around since the beta days. they're classic, i'll always appreciate them.but, to be frank and candid, they're dated, not just in style but in form. they are obviously highly compressed, and the stargate post-jumping sound effect (the leaving-the-cloak whooshing that comes with warping to the next gate) gives me a headache. it has this awful 8-bit-ish distorted ring that wasn't noticeable ten years ago when all game audio was so heavily compressed.all of us who actually play the game have to listen to those *@#%$#% jumpgate sounds over and over and over again, and they are so tiresome after a few hundred times in a day. the stargate sound effects in particular need to be the least compressed and highest quality because they are heard so often. if indeed they are not heavily compressed (they just sound like it), i also know that audio effects generation software has come a long way in the last decade; perhaps what's needed is simply something appropriate for 2009.while nothing else gets on my nerves so much, pretty much all of the sound effects could use a refresh, except the voice-overs are fine."
12/22/2008,eve has sound?seriously this is why i havent had the sound on ingame since about my second month of joining eve.--editmy thumb was borked first time around

12/22/2008,"me thinks, ccp is trying to allow the expanding eve population (hence trit demand), drive miners to low sec."
12/22/2008,i think getting missions and mining them as well as exploration might be a solution. but only if you got someone that can get l4 missions and someone to keep it free from rats before minig commences
12/22/2008,"they've tried doing that for 4 years, and it's never worked. miners are terrified of lowsec because of the wandering ganks they have the ability to avoid much more easily in 0.0lowsec is not a wasteland, granted, it's just a heck of a lot more risky for miners than anywhere else, for very little return (lowsec ores don't offer much over highsec except through exploration... which is all too easily probed out by wandering ganks).ccp needs to address the mining mobs of macros hiding in npc corps to give corps the ability to run them out of their local space (via war declaration). and no, not all npc cowards are macros... just most."
12/22/2008,"i like it, makes sense"
12/22/2008,"yes, they definately need to look at pos logistics.i just abandoned a faction medium and 40 faction modules because i simply don't have 5 hours to unanchor everything one at a time.imo modules should be unanchorable en-masse and not take 10 minutes per single module. or you should be able to unanchor the damn tower and just move it, and then unanchor all the other stuff at your liesure (at the current 60-seconds per item).pos mechanics is just plain broken entirely."
12/22/2008,the pos system is looking dated and needs some love. definitely supported !

12/22/2008,"eve has a lot of rules that are just like the 35f rule. for example, you can only declare war on groups of people, but individuals in a certain type of corp can't be war dec'd. if it was a real sandbox, you could declare war on any individual, group, or groups or people that you wanted to kill.but i do see what your saying - the op is suggesting redundant rules, like group a can do this but only group b can do that - which is stupid. whichever way it goes, both sides need to be able to wage war however they want."

12/23/2008,"i'll try to address these points.* creating new structure artwork will take a day or two, max. don't forget that your deployed mode will probably require new artwork as well.* creating new structure items will be require no more work than creating the many new modules you suggest.* anchoring isn't really that difficult, especially if you're only anchoring one small module.* deployable ships with dynamic cargoholds, fuel requirements, jump clones (session changes) is a whole new system. creating one new structure that is essentially a mini control tower is not.i really like that you're committed to giving younger players access to structure based logistics, but it would be much easier to propose this within the current framework of anchorables, rather than trying to engineer transformer-ships from scratch."

12/23/2008,naw would just see more scorps/bb's.. much cheaper and same effect at that point.no..there was always turret ships everywhere you go since about 80% of the ships in game use them (edit did not read the 2nd page first).null
12/23/2008,i agree. currently eccm has no purpose at all until someone tries to jam you. which then has little strength against ecm anyway.my proposal is that 1 eccm = 1 useless jammer.if you have 1 eccm fit; and 1 ecm jammer starts cycling on you. it's worth nothing.much like warpcore stabs; also since there's no skill which boosts your sensor strength. the current state of eccm doesnt need to be nerfed that significantly. instead of nearly doubling your sensor strength. perhaps only 25% or so.

12/23/2008,"as well as supporting, i would hope we can use this thread to discuss the ramifications this would have on fleet combat and what balance changes would be necessary. do you guys think this change would make missiles overpowered? or ecm? do falcons need a nerf, or ecm in general? falcons are already practically a requirement for any half-decent gang or fleet, and this change would make them even more effective (although it could be argued that since it buffs all e-war an equal amount, no changes are required).is it necessary to nerf ecm if this change were implemented?i would want this system to be available at the same time as the current system. ideally there should be two columns in the overview, one for e-war being used on you, and one for e-war being applied to that target. the current system is kind of messy, the overview has needed fixing for a long time and i would hope that ccp take this idea and implement it whenever they get around to the overview overhaul (which i hope is sooner rather than later)."
12/23/2008,"good idea. it would be really nice to see in the overview who was warp-scrambling a fleet mate, since the warp-scramble effect is really subtle and hard to see."
12/23/2008,"okay, perhaps i misunderstood. are we talking about adding a column of what the ship is doing, or a column of what is being done to the the ship? i thought you meant the former, to make ti easier to pick out jammers and stuff, but you seem to be talking about the latter. that's a very different, though equally interesting, proposal. and i do like your ideal solution - make it actually a separate column, and have all three(done to you by x, done to anyone by x, done to x by anyone) as optional columns on the overview. that shouldn't step on anyone's toes. and while we're at it, can we have overview settings with unique column setups? a lot of these are useful sometimes and wasted space the rest of the time. make it so we can use overview settings to distinguish."

12/23/2008,"not really. imagine the satelite exploding on the surface of the big ship in independance day. that should be how a frigate should interact with a titan.as for course correcting, i really don't think so. when correcting its own course the titan takes ages. but when bumped it turns pretty damned fast!really i'd like this as newb protection. when i was in exe i bumped a bob titan out of its pos in my eagerness o join the fight, and was threatened with being booted for it. protect the newns, they only mean well."
12/23/2008,"true... the best you can do is to block all contracts from the scammer (if you want) or add the scammer in ""blocked"" list so you don't see their spam in local... scammers are not something you should petition, there are scammers in rl so why not in eve. 6 petitions per acount is enough, so no support here"

12/23/2008,"still boost invu fields . an eccm halves the efficiency of a jammer , an invu field decreases dmg only by 30% ,and only applied to the shield and no use when nobody is shooting at you or you have no shield left. so an improvement to 50-60% resists would be necesary, same with the single resists but those should go up to 80-90% resist/module."

12/23/2008,and people actually voted for you?/endtroll
12/23/2008,"if you have a 2.0+ sec status then you can go to a concord station and set yourself to ""player police"" this opens up a new interface that is similiar to the fleet one, whenever a crime is done it appears in that window, with a number next to it saying how many people are involved (how many criminals are within 250km of eachother), a number saying how many police have already responded, and a button saying ""warp"" and if you press it then you warp to the crime.when you warp to a crime you instantly appear in warp 10 au away and warp to the middle (center-point between all the people) of the crimeif a ratio of 2 players to 1 offender is achieved then concord won't even show up, it is just up to the players to kill the offender.if the ratio isn't achieved and concord shows up, then the ratio gets achieved because 1 more player police showed up then concord warps away (leaving the players to clean up)if the ratio gets achieved then another criminal joins in the crime to destabilize the ratio and no more player police show up then concord will come to help.there is no limit to how many players respond to one crime, 20 people can show up to kill 1 ibis who accidentally fired at a passing player. if a player police suddenly goes criminal then he loses sec status equivalent to podding 3 people, and he will be considered a criminal as normal.the person who scores a killing blow on someone gets 10k.it doesn't say who the criminals are, just how many there are and how many other players have already responded.you cannot warp to a crime in lowsec, and there to a crime there, player police is purely restricted to high-secthey do not respond to ore thieves, that is a job for your corp.but why not just bribe everyone? you would need a lot of money to bribe all of the police who show up, and nothing is stopping a bribed person from killing you anyway.a -10 sec person coming into highsec doesn't register as a crime, it isn't until he does something that might reduce his sec status that it counts as a crime .why this would be good: fun!!!if a group of pirates decide to attack highsec then it won't be concord insta-pwning them all, it will instead be a group of players that the pirates can fight against. and even though the pirates will obviously lose (2:1 ratio of people against you is pretty much guaranteed lose) they will still have a $&^*-load of fun and maybe take a few police down with them."
12/23/2008,i support my own idea
12/23/2008,"100k for showing up to a crime? soo....im gonna have my buddies in velators start shooting eachother, and gonna get 4,000 of my corpmates/alts show up.yummy money.how about this ruins all duels in highsec even more than they are already ruined?how about no."
12/23/2008,"i don't think you can mess with the ""concord"" mechanics, and warrior has a good point that the 100k would create an exploit.providing the location is a no-no too, giving every man and his dog free recon capability could really stuff up the pvp mechanics, and open more potential exploits.i think it's a cool idea though, just the changes you're talking about are a bit too far reaching, how about this as a refinement:- only in 0.0 - 0.4, you are substituting concord- all you get with regards to pay is whatever you can loot/salvage- you sign up like you said with a sec rating req- you get alerted when a crime is committed only in the system you are in at the time, and you have a list of criminals with agro timers showing how long you have to bring them to justice- you can gank ""crims"" without taking a security hitthat's it in a nutshell, no other advantages, just getting alerts, having a nice list and not taking sec-hits. essentially this would make things a bit more realistic for anti-pies, afterall they take a sec hit for doing something concord would otherwise do."
12/23/2008,"the main problem i see with this is pirates getting their friends to sign up as police and warping to the incident but doing nothing to help the victim, except causing concord to warp off.welcome to immunity to concord."
12/23/2008,"i already covered this, there is no limit to how many people respond to one crime. and also, it doesn't say the names of the criminals, just how many there are.ok, maybe not a 100k pay for showing up, but 10k per kill, and whatever you can loot/salvage."
12/23/2008,"a friend of mine recently reactivated his account, he was really annoyed that his training hadn't completed but hadn't kept up with the recent announcement regarding it.what really shock him and me was...ccp removed ghost training because it was unfair that people got sp when they dont have an active subscription. 1) but after checking his research agent he realised he had still built up 4 months of rp point (for free), he exchanged them for datacores and made a bit of isk enough infact to support his account for the next 2 months.anybody think this is fair when we all know ccp stance on ghost training????2) my friend was looking at his corp account balance, he is sure when he left 4 months ago there was ~10 million in there, before cancelling he told me he put everything up for sale the day before his account expired, it pretty much all sold and his balance was ~ 2 billion.anybody think this is fair when we all know ccp stance on ghost training????3) he also had research jobs and manufacturing jobs that continued while he wasn't subscribed.anybody think this is fair when we all know ccp stance on ghost training????i ask the csm to bring this issue to ccp and find out why these exploits/bugs/features are acceptable when ghost training wasn't.oh and all these issues have an impact on the database something that was forwarded as a (doubtful) reason for the ghost training fix/nerf."
12/23/2008,"supported fully, cannot have contradicting rules in a game. and unsubed accounts should be able to do nothing to affect the ingame world."
12/23/2008,"full support on this one. come on ccp, stop all this dual standards."
12/23/2008,"there are a few reasons why this is the case at the moment, i'm sure if you think about it you'll easilly work them out, i'm short on time so ill post as much as i can.removing buy/sell orders, research/manufacturing jobs, after an account has terminated would affect the market/jobs in an unpredictable way.since placing buy orders, running jobs etc cost isk, what do you suggest happens to this isk? does it just disappear? is it refunded? it is not enough to simply say ""oh no ccp got rid of ghost training (wich dont forget changes nothing in game for anyone but the subscriber directly affected) you need to see how your suggestions would affect the whole playerbase.again manufacturing/research jobs take time, and if cancelled all resources are lost (except blueprint) so how would this work, does the timer keep going and the job complete but nothing is made/researched, or does it terminate then and there... theres a reason cancelling a job does not free up the slot its in at the moment.example;i start a job that will take 15 days to complete, but my account only has 10 days left, thats ok though because i probably wont log on again untill after the 15 days, unfortunatly short of logging into my account and checking my subscription status i dont know that my subscription is up in 10 days, and so ive not only wasted 10 days, ive wasted a job slot, and possibly a hell of a lot of minerals.in short dont come to the csm and say this is unfair, because well quite frankly nothing is fair in eve, you need to think about the implications of your decisions thoroughly before posting and i dont believe you did that.hope you get what im trying to say, it made more sense in my head"
12/23/2008,this.i would support disabeling datacore farming on inactive accounts though.
12/23/2008,"what happens when new patches are released?what happens when information like 35% of some moon minerals were exploited is released?market is affected in unpredictable ways...whilst i understand ccp need to keep the market stable, they have also got to balance the game, people that affect the game that dont have active subs is something i dont agree with and nor do ccp, one of the reasons stated for the gt removal was it was giving an unfair advantage to some players.now going to extremes and im considering doing this just to show ccp how it can be exploited.1) set up 50 trial accounts. you can get 57 orders out of the box and 14 days of training will increase that some too.2) set up a corp.3) seed the market with over 2500 corp buy orders4) sometime in the future, set up 50 more trial accounts to sell the accumilated stock which would be waiting in the corp deliverieshere i could make an absolute killing in isk and not pay for a single day of my eve time.as with all orders that expire, the day the game time runs out all escrow money is returned and all items are placed back in the player/corps hanger the following downtime. dont get your point sorry.i agree that running out of gametime should not have negative affect to the player, atm if your station runs out of fuel jobs are put on hold until you refuel and then they start again. if they are in an npc station, the slot should remain in use until the end of the period it was installed but in the same paused state as the stations do. once the time is up if only 50% of research was completed only 50% of the me/pe or copies should be granted. manufacturing jobs should stop immediatelly and all minerals/bp returned to the owner.just because this isn't how things work now is no reason to dispute a change to limit exploits.you can use my above example but set up research/production starter characters and use them in the 14 day trial to install research/manufacturing jobs again you can make a killing in isk and never pay a penny in game time. and here was me thinking the csm is the exact place i need to voice my concerns, and yes i have though about how this affects the whole player base, and the player base would be much better off with exploits like those above being removed from the game.editted for spelling, grammer and missed words"
12/23/2008,"i think you seriously misunderstood the worth of buy orders, even doing this is still nothing compared to the money you would make just playing the game at a later level, also im not sure trials can set up corporations, but thats speculative since i've never tried. if this happens the expiry date of buy/sell orders would be null as no-one would be able to predict that the account would not go innactive before the expiry of the order.the mineral amount/cost etc of running ""jobs"" is calculated at the beggining, new mathmatical formulas would have to be put in place to accommodate this, since 50 percent of the order is not neccesarily a rounded number.again the isk acquired by products available to be built by 14 day old trial characters are negligable, in comparison to a player who plays ""properly"".there is no exploit here, but im sure if you keep looking you will find/make one."
12/23/2008,"erm so its ok to have exploits because they would need to code new stuff to stop them hmmmmmmm......so in that case you think ghost traing should have been left alone?you think the moon mineral exploit should have been left alone?i dont think you do, so why such a view point on my suggestions? are you using these exploits and therefore want them to remain ingame?a corp might not be able to be created by a 14 day trial character (not sure either) but, i can start it with a main, i could buy a premade one, lots of options to run this exploit. a 14 day old player doesn't have the isk or knowledge to make much in trade, but a 3 year old eve player with a few billion isk's could make numerous billions off this form of trading.the expiry date of orders is irrelavent. you cannot be 100% sure the person you are selling too has money enough to cover the order. also are skill training times also null (whatever you ment by that) because you cannot be sure you will complete training before game time expirers so we should leave bugs/exploits in the game because it takes effort to recode and make new formulas.....ok not sure anyone would agree but your entitled to your view.yes but with the ""give isk"" feature or the shared corp wallet feature, lots of isk can be donated to the cause.1/2 correct, i cannot ""make"" and exploit unless i somehow get a job making code for ccp or hack there systems which is worse than exploiting and i have noidea where i would start lol.but 1/2 wrong, 4 exploits hereunsubbed tradingunsubbed manufacturingunsubbed researchunsubbed datacore farmingfurther to this, the remove of ghost training added load to the server/database because more calls are required to check if account is active.all the 4 unsubbed examples above add far more load to the server/database than what stopping ghost training added"

12/23/2008,i find the first quote in your latest post about me to be offensive in debate and will no longer justify this topic by reading and posting past this point...
12/23/2008,"thanks for your input so far, no offence was intended but sorry if any was felt."
12/23/2008,"i must disagree, this is not an exploit.it's a zomgwtfhaxploitcheat that is wasting precious database space and processing power that adds 0.x rp every second!! for each unsubbed rp char!!!!"
12/23/2008,i'm only offering support to the fact that training in general needs to be looked at. everything else the op listed should not be changed.
12/23/2008,"rp could do with stopping.research and building are fine tbh, i pay every month via debit card, i don't check to see when my account is about to resub, the only way i ever find out is if ccps payment system breaks (and it breaks often) your idea here: ccps system breaks, account goes inactive, i have 10 dreads in the cooker, i lose all those parts (logs say nothing)support nill points.

12/23/2008,"remove pos mining from the game, and put these minerals into scan sites where miner ships could mine it out."
12/23/2008,wars are fought over good moons. remove wars from the game.
12/23/2008,"yes thats the problem , huge alliances can easily controll the high end moons even while they cant controll the territory. by making them to scan out sites, alliances should have fight for territories and actively use the territory to get the income,imho much better than the current set blue 70% of eve and blob the rest with capitals. there are regions which are completly empty only reason for this is that to gather income doesnt need you to actively present in the region , only use a hauler alt to move out minerals every 2 weeks/fuel pos."
12/23/2008,well attack the hauler alt then. last time i checked haulers were not invinsible and if you destroy the hauler you destroy ~50% of those minerals and you can scoop the rest.only problem here is people allowing the big allaince's a free roam to make the money. but that is only a small % of the player base and there is regular wars/skirmises to try to bring enemy corp/allaince down.
12/23/2008,"oh yes because it is so easy to capture a well flown jump freighter. oh and how do you bring those poses down? the defenders will have 1.5-2 days to prepare for your finishing attack,then you will be outblobbed."
12/23/2008,"only if the defending force is bigger, why should a solo pilot be able to sneak in and raid a large alliances valuable minerals. alliance's need serious money to run and moon mining is the faucet they have been given.do you just want a peice of the pie yourself and are not willing to put in the effort to join/create an alliance big/good enough to take the resorces by force. why should a valuble resource of an alliance be placed in such a way that any solo/low sp character could fly in and take it. and if you think about it if the alliance out blobs you now how do you purpose getting into their space taking their stuff and getting out again?"
12/23/2008,"if they are not there anybody could scan and mine those out. and they will be there when the pos comes out of reinforced. why should anybody own a territory when they are not even there.oh and quess how easy to make an alliance which can hold high end moons on its own. it is impossible. you have to join to one of the power block , and even then you wont have any until you capture some by yourself which is impossible too because you have to take it from your blues or another power block. oh and if you have the numbers to challange one of them without pos income you wont be able to field as much capitals as them and you eighter run out of caps or forced to fall back."
12/23/2008,"look, one of the things that needs to be mentioned is that sovereignty warfare isn't an easy task to accomplish. there is a reason why this highest level of combat is associated with this highest level of income. ccp has long stood by their philosophy that the purpose of pvp is to protect your resources, and the moon-mining pos-warfare form of combat is how alliances can play out that vision.if your problem with moon mining is that it is too easy to defend the operation, then that's what you should address. i would love to see more vulnerable logistics that are separate from military or sovereignty operations, but that's no reason to remove moon mining entirely."
12/23/2008,"if you read the rest of this thread and/or the website, you'll find that the bonus refers to yield, not actual amount in the asteroids.i said this would give incentive, not the end all answer to mining in low-sec. in combination with some other ideas i've seen posted on the forums, such as exploration belts, this will help miners have reason to come to low-sec. the main reason they don't at the moment is because you can make far more money mining in high-sec than low-sec, and this will solve this issue."
12/23/2008,any chance of adding corp/alliance bookmarks to the game ?every corp/alliance in the game has a set of bookmarks that every member needs to get a copy of for each of their characters to move around their space. if you just allow cartain roles within the corps to make bms that anyone in the crop/alliance could use it would make life so much easier and probably remove a lot from the database.also an motd for corp/alliance chat channels.
12/24/2008,please support this proposal.
12/24/2008,"namechange would be good when buying/selling a char, though i'm not sure it should be allowed in other cases"

12/24/2008,"/spamis it better?queue, finally we'll have some."
12/24/2008,i don't post...at all. my time at the computer is usually spent playing eve when time is available. i have 3 kids and a hectic job. i fully support and request the implementation of a skill que.that is all.
12/24/2008,"for god sakes yes, theres no reason to not have this option now."
12/24/2008,the primary-secondary queue seems like it has potential. i'll keep this going to push for that.
12/24/2008,"i'm supporting this because i know that it won't be met as stated, but might result in a compromise (at least a ""train next level"" option).ccp's original reason of giving players a reason to login isn't good enough to deny this. a more honest answer might be, ""because we don't want to."" i'd even consider that acceptable. if they say, ""because it goes against our design philosophy"" i'd even respect them for it-- if they then explained the design philosophy in-depth.in fact, with the number of people in eve (a number i don't remember ever being contemplated when eve was released) i'd say that they have a good reason to not necessarily want people logging in just to change skills.back when eve was sparkly and new and nobody knew what to expect, and the game peaked at under 5k people a day, i accepted the notion that it was to drive player behavior to actually log into their accounts. with the end of ghost training, though, it is entirely equitable that they offer us this in return. it isn't their ""duty"" or their ""responsibility."" but it is a fair exchange."
12/24/2008,"citadel got a lot of lovin from ccp nozh, but there are still issues that need fixing tbh.1) plz fix 'bug' that makes them do no damadge if they were fired just before entering or leaving siege.2) give them a small speed boost to 850-900 m/s.tnx"
12/24/2008,"having just spent far too long copying settings for 3 accounts from my old eve pc to my new one and then having them totally nuked by what appeared to be a damn soundcard bug (crashed all 3 chars and on restart the settings were all back to defaults) <shakes fist at realtek>, i have to say this is a long overdue addition thats desperately needed."
12/24/2008,yes.
12/24/2008,"nice, me wants!"
12/24/2008,yes
12/24/2008,bumpage
12/24/2008,bump and agree with the op! hang the heretics!!
12/24/2008,"the fact is the people who play eve - us - need to police ourselves and i for one will happily support the public hosting or display of any proof people have that an alliance, corp or person cheated, ccp cheated, outside the network that ccp controls.in fact, think isomebody should start a website devoted to that sort of thing.."
12/24/2008,"i'll add my support to this.i was drawn to faction warfare by the grand trailers showing fleets of opposing ships knocking the stuffing out of each other. now i didn't expect it to be quite as smooth, but unfortunately my experience of fw so far has been lagfest after lagfest for those of us who want to enjoy full scale fleet battles as opposed to small guerrilla operations. and after all the improvements to the server code and whatnot, i must say i'm bit disappointed as the lag i experienced seemed far worse than it was before. so a few systems where we could go with the full knowledge that the servers are doing their damndest to keep it all flowing smoothly would be great addition to fw."
12/24/2008,"well ccp should upgrade their server base, with the current player base it is far behind the needs.they said the software is rdy to handle those huge fights ,make the hardware part rdy too."
12/24/2008,"while the basic idea is reasonable, the problem is the number of dedicated nodes available for all eve.for all i know there are 2 or 3 mission hubs with a dedicate node, plus jita. probably another 2-3 nodes are dedicated to ""programmed"" fleet warfare between alliances. that make 5-7 dedicated nodes with the top hardware to get the better performance. adding another 4 nodes mean at least a 50% increase in of the number of dedicated nodes. nodes that will not be used to get the best performance for all eve. so the question is if the cost in hardware used is worth the return. there are daily fleet engagements in those systems? or you want the upgrade so that it will be possible to get daily fleet engagements if the players were interested? stated that, 4 systems seem a reasonable quantity at least for a testing period, so supported."
12/24/2008,i 100% support this fw will die if something is not done.
12/24/2008,well said kane and good to see you back :)
12/24/2008,supporting this with the 12 hour turnaround when at v.
12/24/2008,awesome.
12/24/2008,"here's the thing...tracking computers help against tracking disruptors but also give a bonus at other times.sensor boosters help against dampeners but also give a bonus at other times.eccms are very effective when you're being jammed, but just sit there when you're not.rather than boosting the bonus that eccms give, how about giving them another role on top of the bonus to sensor strength?another option would be to change the ecm mechanism is such a way that it again becomes possible to have an effective non-racial sensor strength on your ship (ie having radar on a caldari ship), and then make the jamming ship overcome both sensor types."
12/24/2008,"we really need one.a huge list, an official list, an up-to-date list.what we can't do in the game or what is the limit for x or y while doing z.it's that simple.the reason is simple: those pushing the boundaries of the so called ""game mechanics"" right now might or might not be banned, on the sole decision of ccp's devs and gms, without a guideline about it.if ccps gives an upper limit:we will know when we should stopit's easier to petition those bannable offences in case they ever show upbetter gameplay overall?yep, that's pretty much like it."
12/24/2008,support
12/24/2008,would be good to know
12/24/2008,yup.
12/24/2008,bet this makes topic of the week.
12/24/2008,"this thread is an example of why a list is needed. lots of people remember seeing that it is an exploit, but none of them are able to prove it. add in a couple of people who don't think it is an exploit and people reading the thread just get confused.but if we had an official list of exploits, one person can simply link there as proof to quickly end the discussion."
12/24/2008,"fully supported.there's nothing worse then trying to figure out if what you're about to do ingame is either considered an exploit or clever tactics. ccp and gms should not be taking action against players when the rules are not clearly defined.after all, how can we avoid doing the wrong thing if we don't even know what that is? ""ignorance of the law is no excuse"" is one thing, but when that law isn't written down nor is accessible, it becomes a different situation altogether. i understand bugs happen and that's ok. if there is something in question, ccp should put out an official statement about it and whether it's ok or considered an exploit."
12/24/2008,yes
12/24/2008,either this or a list of what is not a bannable offense.
12/24/2008,this has no chance of passing for same reason ccp never allows discussion of exploitsthink about it
12/24/2008,"we're suppose to magically know what not to do.we're suppose to be able to read minds.but seriously a list is good for something to reference too,"
12/24/2008,yeah how should we know if something is an exploit if there is no list of those.
12/24/2008,"the more i think about it, the more i see the need of a ""not to do"" list."
12/24/2008,good idea.
12/24/2008,supported
12/24/2008,supported
12/24/2008,"yet ccp does tell us when things will be considered an exploit. for example, i remember an announcement saying that entering fw complexes with ships other than what the gate allows is an exploit. but i can't find that announcement again, meaning i don't have any proof to someone who doesn't believe me.all we are asking if for ccp to put all of those in the same location so that we can refer people to it. if the code gets changed to prevent an exploit, leaving it listed as an exploit covers people who find another way to do it, and anyone who wants to exploit can't be sure which exploits will work.the only time we would wand ccp to remove something from the exploit list would be if ccp changes their mind over it.ccp only needs to give information about the results of the exploit, not details on how to do it."
12/24/2008,yeah i never know if something that is done to/by me is allowed
12/24/2008,"the first time i saw this, i was against it because it indirectly encourages players to find things not explicitly on the list. however, a list of all actions classified as exploits, grouped with the appropriate sections of the eula, wouldn't be a bad resource.even if it does help players find more exploits by reverse engineering the list, it should also help ccp find those new exploits quicker."
12/24/2008,started doing an unoficcial one
12/24/2008,this would be a great idea couse know that ive been woundering if an entire corp hopping from corp to corp to avoid a war was an offence sevral time but ccp kept giving me compleat different answers from different ccp members
12/24/2008,last thing i want is ccp creating an npc seed of moon minerals and such to fill in the demand of the lost volume from the exploit.*dr. e did say this may be what it will come to*alchemy is good except it needs to be done in large volume. those towers dont exist.allow carebears in high sec fill this volume. i would be quite willing to put up a tower to start doing alchemy. this would make alchemy work.1. lower end moon minerals become stressed? low sec gets more moon miners?2. alchemy isnt enough to fulfill the volume even with high sec? alchemy failed.i see no downside in this because the moon minerals themselves still have to come from low sec-0.0.
12/24/2008,you have numbers proving that low-sec alchemy is insufficient?
12/24/2008,"dear op please provide the proof for this posters query.the way i see it is there are plenty of low sec and 0.0 pos, but maybe you are just afraid of the risk you might run, if ""forced"" to operate in those enviroments.p.s. i am a confirmed carebear, and yet i have at different times run as many as 15 pos in low sec by myself. with very minimal loss.p.s.s. dear pirates reading the above ""p.s."" dont go running off to your locator agents, as i currently do not operate any lowsec or 0.0 pos farms."
12/24/2008,op smokes crack
12/24/2008,"high sec really does not need another boost to the reward side, moon mining and reacting in low sec is fine. the risk acts a barrier to entry, as people who are willing to take a little more risk will be appropriately rewarded, yet not too many people will enter the market and depress prices.still it is not impossible to run a multi pos moon mining/reaction chain with solo with relative safety. i personally know a few people who have done it solo successfully.until more concrete data is released by ccp regarding the depth of the exploit, it is unwise to make any changes to this area."
12/24/2008,"allowing moonmining in 0.4 and maybe even 0.5 is a lot better and easier solution to material shortage imo.plenty of moons with nothing in them in low/0.0, could place some new resources in those as well."
12/24/2008,right now if you have a dread sieged... it cant be remote repped or scramed... but that isnt exactly true. a hictor can scram a dread when sieged.how about make it able to break through the dread siege ew. able to remote rep the sieged dreads.could make for some interesting battles.balance: only able to do it when using triage mod.
12/24/2008,"that could be usefull if applied to triage'd carriers, not motherships."
12/24/2008,carriers are too cheap and often a pain to kill but often lost.which is why motherships is perfect for the job. eve could stand to risk moms more often.
12/24/2008,i wouldn't risk my mom and get it into triage to rep a bunch of siege'd dreads. seriously.but i'd be gladly offering my carrier as a sacrifical lamb to protect sieged dreads.
12/24/2008,"hmm yes, lets stick my mothership in one place for ten minutes while it can't be remote repped in order to make a dread live a few seconds longer.perfect, i see this being used all the time."
12/24/2008,excellent idea. anything that makes the fc's job a little easier is always a good thing.
12/24/2008,"yes, sorry if i wasn't clear. i want a column to show all e-war effects that are being applied to a ship, next to that ship, on the overview. possibly also on the main screen as well?ccp have said multiple times they're planning on doing a thorough overhaul on the overview very soon. i'm just trying to make sure that this change goes through at that time."
12/24/2008,"stupid idea on a lot of levels. a) game dynamics. bumping is pretty much the only thing that makes gate ***gotry and station ***gotry counterable, short of overwhelming force. if a tanked domi is sitting hugging a station, my recourse shouldn't have to be to cyno in a phoenix and 4^10x45 target paint him.b) your point of resistances and a fly and truck is a fallacy of composition. to make the analogy correct, you'd have to assume the fly was made of an equally dense material, and was moving faster than the target in question. perhaps think an anti-tank shell into the wall of a tank :p"
12/24/2008,"have you ever wondered why gates are so massive? they could be bumped away once upon a time.they have way to much mass to exist right now, but it was made so they were unbumpable poles fixed in a point of the space.even if you consider bumping ""broken"" it's fine with the current gameplay for me. off course, i'm not ever trying to bump a titan with a frigate."
12/24/2008,"i support at least the different colorization of your own text - that shouldn't be overly difficult at all to implement, and would help.i'd love to see people in your address book have a different color, even one set by you - as well as different colors for people in your fleet, corp, and alliance much like you have in the overview; but i wonder if it's worth the likely increased time to program."
12/24/2008,irc style. i like it.
12/24/2008,amen to this.
12/24/2008,"the idea is good, i am not totally convinced it will not have negative effects on lag as it will re-check the bonus every time the fleet jumps/decloack/someone leave/is added and so on. it already do that, but adding a display of the changing bonuses (there is always someone that will keep a information window open) can add lag.so long as it is only for the people with the display window open, no problem. so supported, it is at least worth testing it."
12/24/2008,supported and i'll champion this at the next csm meeting.
12/24/2008,"to those of you who have bumped this thread, your posts have been removed. bumping is a form of spam and is therefore not allowed.continued bumping will result in warnings being issued and this thread being locked. please do not go this route."
12/24/2008,"don't like it. :)the problem with this suggestion is simple - your suggestion is that the 'downside' of not being seen in local is that you can't see local; but since any alt char of yours, any corp mate, any alliance member and any buddy on aim/msn can see local, there is no effective downside.sorry, but that makes this 'compromise' for local intel worse than the usual suggestion of just turning it off altogether."
12/24/2008,there is no freedom of speech on the forums.
12/24/2008,"while i can appreciate what you are hoping to achieve dr. penguin. i will have to say no to your idea. it would be to easy to work around this issue, with the ammount of people that have multiple accounts.with such an ""easy"" work around i do not feel it is our best intrest as players, to encourage the csm or ccp to spend blood, sweat, tears, time and money on a ""fix"" that would be really very very easy for a vast portion of the player base to circumvent via their alt accounts."
12/24/2008,what is effing and blinging?i dont thing your idea would solve anything at all.
12/24/2008,storyline: these are regional criminal bosses.basically create a very small chance for these officer rats to spawn in 0.1 and 0.2 systems. the officer spawns are battlecruisers themselves and drop officer medium mods.on top of this... there's a similar chance of these officers spawning in crappy 0.0 so all around good boost; also provides officer medium mods which can be fun.
12/24/2008,"no, it's fine as-is."
12/24/2008,lol! no.
12/24/2008,"even if anyone can show up it's still going to be too easy to abuse.lets say you have 10 gankers, they bring 20 police alts, set themselves up in a relatively quiet system (less then 50 people in local). now they can just start ganking everything that moves without concord intervention. even if any police officer shows up he'll get ganked, as 1 vs 10 he has no chance."
12/24/2008,"i like the idea of player police, however your vision of it is more complex than what i believe is necessary.fleet type interface, where you volunteer to be the police.crime happens, you are warped to the crime instead of concord. use the current concord response, i think it's 2 bs and a frig per ship causing the crime? and so that there are 'consequences' for being a 'bad guy', allow this new police to pod the 'bad guy'.you get the enjoyment of policing your system, constellation, or region. but bad guys get to shoot at you back!no need for payment, you get to collect loot like the rest of us. i highly doubt there will be a lack of players who would volunteer to do this.if the police decide to switch side in the middle of the fight, just don't allow them to be police for a month or some random time frame. people do accidentally shoot at the wrong target.leave the specific balancing up to the csm to discuss and ccp to test. but no way should there be payment."
12/24/2008,"it's a better idea if we're talking about occasional, random missions in high-sec, with a forced tem to play with.now that would be an idea.for concord, no, it is a deterrent for the high-sec ""false safe space"" and shouldn't be changed to player-driven."
12/24/2008,"what are your views on a skill queuing system? do you support it, and if so in what form. if you don't support the idea what are your reasons?"
12/25/2008,this is what pos's should look like.
12/25/2008,awesome idea. i would love to blow up something so beautiful
12/25/2008,"the ""pos: the dead horse"" original thread in features & ideas discussions forum is celebrating it's 3d christmas! that's right people, it has seen 3 christmas holidays come and gone, and it is still here. i wonder if there is any other player supported thread that has been as heartily ignored, for as long of a time, as the pos overhaul. csm - bring this to ccp again! and again! and again! and again! just because ccp tells you it is ""too much work"" does not mean you have to slink away, and play nice.players have been keeping the thread alive for 3 years, well, almost, and so far ccp worked really hard to ignore it. shouldn't it be your job to make it happen? i am sorry, i know, iceland trips are more important than making waves, and bringing ccp things they really do not want to deal with. merry christmas everyone."
12/25/2008,"supported, and make them tractorable."
12/25/2008,"this should really just be able without any skills, but if for whatever reason that isn't possible, a skill could be an acceptable workaround."
12/25/2008,"yes. this is a good idea except it shouldnt need skills. if nothing else, please make disabled drones tractorable."
12/25/2008,supported and championed at the next csm meeting.
12/25/2008,the targeting + attempt to get control thing is really fukken clever. ccp should have thought of that. would make looting drones easier.
12/25/2008,"wow! 2 months and already 17 pages of support. ccp, when are you gonna have a little sympathy? bump it on up!"
12/25/2008,"a skill queue would make getting a life possible and remove any excuse i may have for doing so. i favor the ideas, whether original or not, of ddredar (i.e. the addition of a new skill, perhaps in the learning category, for skill queue training) and also of serenity steele (i.e. a skill queue driven by certificate goals).in addition to these two great ideas, i suggest that when a player has not trained a skill or logged on within eight hours (negotiable), that the account be flagged as inactive. in this way, a player is only charged for the time during which skill training and game play occurs. ccp will surely love this idea and it will likely only require a few lines of code. i look forward to seeing you in the new year.-wheat"
12/25/2008,"hello all,this is my ninth, and final, proposal to ccp for the reykjavik meeting. it deals with ship coloring, giving a way for players to feel their ship is more than a carbon-copy of everybody else's ships.current ships in the game have little you can do to differentiate them from other ships. rigs gave us some way we could augment the ship to fit our play style, but still leaves a lot to be desired.after doing a lot of work looking at the throughput required when a ship loads into the screen, i believe a simple painting scheme would allow us to make the ships our own without bottlenecking the servers. some coding will need to be done to implement this, but it should be a relatively easy process.the first step is to give a checkbox in the escape menu to allow people to turn this feature off if they desire, as it could weigh down blob warfare even more than it has already. then, the ship models will have to be split up into two separate sections, and a colormap applied to each section as desired.this colormap will consist of a pallette of colors which allows only 12 bits to cover each of the two sections of a ship and allowing the servers to deliver the information to the respective client interfaces (using 4 bits per rgb color). each one of these sections could be colored the same or differently depending on the desires of the pilot, as listed below:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.given the depth this simple change would allow, it would give a large amount of individuality to the ships, and a simple interface to 'repaint' the ships. there could even be a charge in the game for repainting a ship.this idea is still in it's early stages, but i think this is a good way to implement the color schemes without lagging the user computers too much. with the checkbox available on the menu, it would give the users the option to turn it off in high-load environments (such as jita or blob warfare in 0.0)."
12/25/2008,"i think there are far more useful things for ccp's bandwidth and database to have to deal with that this ""fluff""."
12/25/2008,"more data which needs to be loaded as you enter grid, unless it's lazily loaded, in which case it's meaningless.don't like the idea. not worth the effort at all."
12/25/2008,"adding more more things for the server to load is probably not the best idea.i can see this being easily exploited by creating lag traps (i.e. a 100-200 man fleet from alliance ""a"" with each ship colored and textured differently sitting on a gate. allaince ""b"" jumps in and gets badly lagged out).no, not unless such a scheme will have absolutely no effect on lag/database"
12/25/2008,yeah!
12/25/2008,hell yeah.
12/25/2008,"great to be back mate, thanks."
12/25/2008,the idea is worthy of consideration. i would like to obtain t2 bpos with lp.
12/25/2008,whoops forgot to support
12/25/2008,"i go away, i come back, i go away, i come back. i see how others are disoriented by the lack of documentation on bannable offenses. since i typically start a brand new character when i return, i see the frustration that others have regarding limits that they can't find posted anywhere. and often there is confusion, it is a matter of oral tradition and that is rarely a good thing on the internet.the main problem, though, is that it seems that a majority of eve players never visit the forums. i've met people who have been in the game for a year and never went back to the website after activating their accounts.having a record of what is and is not a bannable offense, perhaps maintained on the evelopedia, would be good just to dispel rumors and serve as a reference point for new pilots on a going-forward basis. this list does not have to be all-inclusive, and it doesn't have to say step by step how to reproduce the bug-- for example simply stating that duping or producing materials from an invalid source is bannable would cover the pos ferrogel problem as well as any similar bugs. specific tactics that are contextual such as can-baiting in starter systems should be mentioned, however, because it remains possible and is a valid tactic in other situations.i understand the whole ""we don't want to tell the world how to cheat before we fix it"" line, but a list of bannable offenses doesn't have to be a how-to guide."
12/25/2008,"fully support, am interested to know if some of my tricks are dangerous to use."
12/25/2008,"this is crazy talk.... far too reasonable for ccp to consider this, it'll never happen.but if it does, it has my full support :d"
12/25/2008,"so... when someone does something that isn't on an ""official"" list you are opening the door for folks to exploit things not on that list and give them the ability to go ""well, it's not on the official list, so it must be allowed!""no support here, i can see something like this doing much more harm than good, at least as currently suggested."
12/25/2008,/signed
12/25/2008,"at the top of the list put something like the following: this list only includes declared exploits. if ccp declares something that is not on this list an exploit, they may still chose to punish players involved if they believe those players to be deliberately exploiting even if those players exploited before the exploit was declared.then place a definition of an exploit, and tell players to contact ccp through the petition system if they are unsure of anything.if anyone then tries that argument, ccp can just point to the above text to show that the argument ""it's not on the list, therefore it's legit"" will not be accepted.what harm would this idea cause ?the current system allows people to say that they thought something was just clever gameplay for some things declared an exploit because they never saw the announcement. but if a page of known exploits exists, ccp can also alter the eula to require people to read it, thus preventing the ignorance argument.as an example, i'll use the exploit that allows people to enter fw plexes with ships bigger than the acceleration gate allows. that description gives enough information to let people know if they are performing it, without saying anything about how to do it beyond it being possible. and it gives enough information for anyone seeing the exploit to know that it has happened.the announcement about it was only on the character selection screen for a few days (maybe a week). if someone wasn't online then, they would of missed it. then they could of easily thought that this specific method (i think i know what it was) was clever gameplay, not an exploit. in fact, i'd probably be doing it by know had i not seen the notice.you may also note that by not giving the specifics of how to perform the exploit, only the results of the exploit, they also include other potential exploits under the same notice if they have a similar effect.so what harm could this cause that would outweigh the above gain ?"
12/25/2008,"what kind of twisted argument are you exposing?the list is for the sole purpose of listing the current exploits and official bannable offences, it doesn't says ""if something is not on the list you're free to do it"".if you're doing something that isn't contemplated on the list, it doesn't mean it couldn't be a bannable offence.for god sake, if you're flying 50 au/s with your ship and fitting multiple mwds right now, that's an exploit, it's not hard to recognize, it only takes few brain cells..."
12/25/2008,"not to mention, we aren't allowed to discuss what is or is not an exploit on the forums. which means about the only way to get a written list has to be elsewhere on the website. i would strongly suggest that this makes it perfect for the csm to push with ccp, because as players we're prohibited from explaining what is or is not an exploit with people who want to know if x is allowed.and from that ""unofficial list"" (locked within hours) even in that there was confusion over what was an exploit and what was not."
12/25/2008,"oops, drunk posting for the lose :( lol, excuse my post and thanks for not flaming too bad. the only reason i really noticed this is someone flew through a system in game last night and posted the link so i visited it and read it in only a half logical state. at the time i read the suggestion more as ""if you don't see it on the list, it's ok to do"" instead of as a list of currently known issues defined as exploits by ccp."
12/25/2008,"this will never pass because it would just throw more light on dev alliances (which of course we cant have now can we)and their ""playstyle""nevertheless, in the hopes of a miracle i fully support"
12/25/2008,can only see good things come from this.
12/25/2008,"hello all,this is the seventh in my series of ideas i would like to present to ccp for the reykjavik meeting. this one creates a nasty surprise for gate gankers and ore thieves by enhancing the black ops ship with a new module.it's tough mining in low- and null-security space, even in a group. this idea gives the industrialist an ace up his sleeve when in such mining ops or even in high-security space running the jita route.the holographic imager is a module specially designed for black ops ships. using it, a black ops can appear as one of their race's haulers typically used for mining operations. the module and the skill to use it is explained below:holographic imagerhigh-slot modulecpu: 6000, grid: 100, uses 200 energy every 5 seconds (same as a large shield booster)99% less cpu needed when mounted to a black ops ship.this module projects the image of an industrial that would commonly be used from that faction over the ship, disguising the true nature of the ship. even scanners can be fooled by this unit, luring would-be pirates into a deathly trap.chance to deceive scanners: 5%. once the deceit chance is resolved, further scans do the scanner no good.when active, this module slows the ship down to the equivalent of a hauler of the appropriate type to further fool onlookers. this penalty and the image itself drop as soon as the first weapon is fired or the first drone is released.holographic deception (rank 4): the skill to using holographic imagers to deceive others. each level in this skill increases the chance to deceive scanners probability by 15%.this idea will create a new role for the black ops ships in all securities of space, and give an ace up the sleeves of any operations trying to protect themselves. constructive criticism is always welcomed."
12/25/2008,funny idea
12/25/2008,"interesting, but why limit the inherently flexible technology of holographic projection only to one image, an industrial?could be more exciting to be able to choose which ship to decoy yourself as, via some sort of loadable holodisks (akin to mining laser crystals). the further away the decoy ship's class is from your blackops ship, the more ranks of holographic deception will the use require."
12/25/2008,"i actually rather like it. certainly one of the more humerous and obscure of ideas.i think for now it should be limited to as suggested above. adding too many options, too soon would force a radical rethink to alot of pvp. all that at once would in my oppinion be too much not to mention a hell of alot of work for the dev's.but, this owuld be an interesting beta test for this system.support given."
12/25/2008,yeah why not
12/25/2008,funny boost to black ops. i would definitely buy one of those...
12/25/2008,"so a battleship which can cloak, jump to cyno's and create portals. not only that, but it can hide like a hauler?my general rule of thumb is that if you use a mechanic that's questionable to avoid being killed, that's not an exploit. if you use a questionable mechanic to lure people into doing something or outright killing somebody, that's an exploit.i strongly disagree with this idea."
12/25/2008,"if you use a questionable mechanic, it is probably not an exploit, unless ccp says something about it. your rule of thumb quite sucks."
12/25/2008,good idea
12/25/2008,good idea
12/25/2008,lets have it done.
12/25/2008,"this idea is so amazing i can't help but support it, ccp lets get it implemented."
12/25/2008,great idea.
12/25/2008,"great idea, i'm all for it!"
12/25/2008,/signed
12/25/2008,"when contracts first came out i myself looked for this. never found it, obviously.good idea."
12/25/2008,"hello all,this topic is the fifth in the series of ideas i would like to present to ccp for the reykjavik meeting. this one deals with a way to give active miners an advantage while still allowing for afk mining at reduced rewards. it's based off of an optional mini-game to enhance yield of mining lasers.right now, the whole effort of mining consists of locking an asteroid, activating your lasers, and solving world hunger while your ship does all the work until either the asteroid is gone or the cargohold is full. making it more dynamic will improve interest without forcing people to be at the keyboard all the time.in my proposal, the mining lasers on a ship would all be controlled by one mini-console that pops up when you choose to activate the lasers. in static mode (the current mode), the lasers would operate as they currently do with no significant change to yield or cycle time.in dynamic mode, the lasers could have their cpu usage and powergrid modified on the fly to get more ore and/or lower cycle times, but it also has a risk of giving less ore. this movie is a brief animation of a similar process in another game i sometimes play called ""a tale in the desert"" (do not try to open in the in-game browser).there are multiple sliders which control variables, and those variables according to a derived mathematical equation change the output dynamics of the item in question. in eve, this would be represented by the cpu and powergrid of the lasers, which would modify the yield and duration attributes while also having a chance to overload the laser, which would end the cycle prematurely, giving less ore.this would allow for greater interest in mining and a reason to stay at the keyboard while mining. constructive criticism is always welcomed."
12/25/2008,mining needs a complete overhaul. this isn't enough.
12/25/2008,*bumps yorda into pos shields**receives bj of gratitude*
12/25/2008,"what happens when you get 10 of those spider tanking?what kind of cap fleet would be needed to break that tank? if this idea greatly increases the requirement of killing the enemy, then this idea will require much larger blobs. just saying"
12/25/2008,10 moms stuck in triage somewhere? that's around 250 billions...
12/25/2008,"i seen that many when mc steamrolled in the north half a year ago. now there are 10 times as many.people in charge have to take that scenario, because if it can be done, people will do it, simple as that. people probably didn't think there'd be jump bridges in all decent systems of 0.0 either"
12/25/2008,it's always nice to know what is going on. this would ensure that people who have turned off most fancy features in large fleet battles can rely on this instead.
12/25/2008,"hello all,this idea is the fourth in the series i hope to present to ccp at the reykjavik meeting. this one deals with miners and jetcan mining in general, without eliminating jetcan mining and the opponents it creates.the containers in the game of eve do not serve the function they were originally designed for. it's obvious that they were not designed for 'saddlebagging', where they enlarge the size of the cargohold of a ship. their use as a stashing area for ore during mining, while it may have been effective when the game was first released, is currently almost useless with the yield of a mining barge or exhumer.while i believe that larger containers themselves would be counterproductive to the game, there is an option for a new type of container. this container would not be able to be used while in a cargohold or station, but only when deployed in space during mining operations.this container should cost about 5,000 isk and take up 500 m3 while unassembled (similar to the way the pos structures or ships take up far less space when unassembled, and able to fit inside a properly-equipped astrometric frigate). they would be weaker than a standard container, with less hitpoints, and would only exist in space for 24 hours if left assembled (but could be disassembled to take it back into the ship's cargohold).the container would fit up to 15,000 m3 (about half of what a jetcan holds) and would take about 30 seconds to assemble or disassemble in space, as well as anchoring and password protecting it. it could be accessed by any hauler to remove the ore (with the appropriate password, of course), and would only be able to be disassembled once empty. it would not take any roles to deploy, but the anchoring skill (level 1) would be required to anchor and password protect it. as with all deployables, the container would not be able to be anchored in 0.8 or higher security systems, but could still be deployed (without the password).i believe this would be one of the best options for the continual fight against or for canflipping, while still allowing the easier method of jetcanning to be used. as always, i accept any constructive criticism on this topic."
12/25/2008,"ccp already introduced a larger mining container, i think they call it an orca."
12/25/2008,"bad idea, mining is already to easy, too safe and too profitable"
12/25/2008,"of course, everybody knows the orca is cheap and easily accessable to new players in the game. also, if mining is so stupidly easy, why are the prices on minerals continuing to rise?"
12/25/2008,"because macrominers are rising prices, and because ccp dont want to do anything to end it (you know, mining boots, 20 mackinaws with dgfdgre nicks mining 23/7 for months), well it is like it isccp like macrominers because every active account more = more real cash"
12/25/2008,"the rising price of trit has nothing to do with how easy or not easy mining is. it has to do with the cause and effect relationship between supply and demand. if you fail to understand the underlying causes between supply and demand then i suggest you go visit the market disccusions board, and have them explain it to you."
12/25/2008,"i'm sorry, you must've thought that the word minerals only refers to tritanium. there are 8 ore-based minerals in this game, and tritanium is only one of them. the prices on all of them have been continuing to rise because demand is higher than supply. what i'm trying to do is to draw interest into the activity of mining, thereby increasing supply and balancing out the prices.new players often quit mining due to ore theft, which i'm not trying to get rid of completely (as i've outlined above). this will just give them a practical way of mining without having to worry about the abundant supply of ore thieves out there."
12/25/2008,a larger can would be always a good idea.
12/25/2008,i agree with this.
12/25/2008,"jetcan mining is an exploit.the intended way to mine is to fill up cargo -> warp to station. or, fill up one of the smaller secure contianers.jetcan mining is kept in the game because it adds risk to miners for the extra potential profit. anything that allows miners basically the same benefit of a jetcan without any of the risk is stupid and should never be added."
12/25/2008,no there are plenty of tools and methods available. no need to dumb down the system anymore.
12/25/2008,"i, for one, am laughing uncontrollably at this suggestion.supported, i really want to see people cursing trial accounts suiciding against your 15k secured can."
12/25/2008,another simple but very usefull feature
12/25/2008,would be nice
12/25/2008,hell yeah!
12/25/2008,"in pretty much every space fiction you come across, if there is reference to a tractor beam, it is used for far more exciting things than ""picking loot up"" how about allowing the tractor beam to affect another ship. the tractor beam to have a certain strength, linked to it's size and the stats of your own ship, and whatever you throw the tractor beam on.. this will then either move that ship, move you or both.. eg, sitting still in a battleship, if you get a tractor beam on an inty flying past you at 5km/s, it will drastically slow the inty and pull you in the direction of the interceptors travel, using some kind of mathematical formula driven from the two ships stats.. thrust, mass, agility etc etc. the uses for this could then be huge.. a few in corp interceptors or hacs throw tractor beams onto a freighter to drag it into warp faster, a rorqual uses it's capital transporter to pull an afk hulk out of a belt.. pirates can use it to pull an afk ship out of jump range of a gate.. invaders use it to pull capital ships out of docking range of a 0.0 station. introduce medium and heavy tractor beams, allow capital beams onto carriers, dreads, motherships and titans too.. all with range and tractor speed modifiers.."
12/25/2008,"hahahaha imagine doing some afk mining and some1 just tractors you some kkm out in dead space and you come back like omfg how the hell did i get here this would be freaking hillariuous, imagine a fleet of tractor carriers(tm) used to pull the enemy ships in to range! you just sitteng there like ""nah their to far away... wait what the f...! ohsh*t!!"" hahahahabut really you do have a point here, there 'should' be ship tractors, and the number of uses for it would be very largethe coolest thing would be fitting a ship tractor on a marauder to suck in enemys to tear apart with closa range waeponaryyou could build you own acceleration gates with this lol, just get a few very heavy ships in a row and start catapulting smaller ships out into nowhere"
12/25/2008,"it would ofcourse, cause aggression, if you used it on another ship. but i'd suggest not causing it if you set your tractor beam on a stargate or station.. :-)"
12/25/2008,why labs and asambly lines arent linked to tower? and you have to click each asambly line then manufacturing slot. its so annoying when you have more than 10. all slots should be avaiable from pos tower. instalations -> pos tower - > list of manufactuing/research slots should be this way. not instalations -> mobile lab/modile lab/asambly line/ asambly line (spam x 30) - > click each -> loook for free slot - > then use it
12/25/2008,no feedbeck of others?
12/25/2008,tbh that whole part of the ui could use a revamp so support given to any ideas to make it better.
12/25/2008,yes!
12/25/2008,"hello all,this is my eighth proposal to ccp for the reykjavik meeting. this one will create a stronger appeal for all sections of space, giving all participants a chance to enjoy their sections of space.eve is marked by a great dichotomy of players. the following points describe small or great changes to these sections of space which allow the reputations to be modified slightly. these changes, in cooperation with other ideas from ccp and the players, will enhance each system, creating an area where people don't mind travelling to. many of these ideas have already been discussed in other sections of this website, such as ore distribution and enhanced missions.high security spaceit's pretty apparent that high-security space doesn't need any advantages to be attractable to others, but some changes can still be made in this region to help it out. ank already did us the imminent service of making suicide ganking harder to do, but it doesn't have to stop there.low security spacethe first thing that needs improved in low-security space is it's reputation for gate camps. sentry guns used to be vicious, but with the technology upgrades they have become easily resistable. i think the guns should start out doing the same damage that they do now, and gradually increase that by like 10% per minute. the guns should also 'remember' everybody on that grid, so they can't just warp away and return to reset the counter.also, they should remove the limitations for poses in 0.4 space. no charter cost, and the ability to use the same modules as poses in 0.3 space, will greatly open up other functions such as moon mining, without breaking the game as we know it.these changes won't improve the security of low-security space too greatly, but it will reduce (without completely preventing) the camping of gates, giving more freedom of movement.null security spacealliances tend to make their homes in what is called 0.0 space. in this, i plan to give them more options while still maintaining the core idea for this game.the first change that i think deserves to be made is that npc pirates should no longer give a boost to security status for killing them. their rewards are already more than sufficient, and why would your security go up if it can't go down in this region. this would also serve to have player pirates remain in low-security space to boost their status, giving the other players more and juicier targets.i also want to endorse the idea that sovereignty means more, eventually giving players the ability to react to threats to their domain better, while still allowing for guerrilla tactics. once an alliance reaches sovereignty level 2, they should be able to extract a tax for any npc pirates destroyed in their system by other players. this will encourage them to open their doors to such players, creating a nation rather than a domain.at sovereignty level 3, i think gate guns should be purchasable for the alliance in control, which would fire on anybody with negative standings to the alliance. these guns could be destroyed, and would not be cheap.at sovereignty level 4, there should be a new option for the players called a system scanner, which would detect people in the system with a 2 minute delay (meaning that ambushers would have to be constantly on the move to really annoy the opposition). because of the already harsh penalty, the scanner should also be able to detect cloaked ships, but only within 20 km.these ideas would bring out each area's strongpoints, without majorly affecting the way the game is played. constructive criticism is always welcomed."
12/25/2008,supporting except that part about not receiving security status boost when killing npc in 0.0
12/25/2008,all your null sec ideas are terrible. stick to what you know.
12/25/2008,"you had me willing to support you till i got to your 0.0 ideas, the answer is no support from me."
12/25/2008,"definite no to the 0.0 ideas, sounds like you want a high sec with enhanced rewards."
12/25/2008,"high-sec is fine. it's a bit too safe though in some aspects.i don't like your low-sec idea. it won't change a thing quite frankly.your 0.0 idea is not very good. the very first thing, 0.0 rats not increasing sec-status, is enough reasons for me to say no."
12/25/2008,"can some1 please tell me why every1 seems to want to make gate guns more powerful?how does decreasing the nuber of places in system where you can fight make lowsec more attractive?how does making it harder to deffend your whatever assets/miners/pos's in a lowsec system make lowsec more attractive?i can see the positive side of this, fewer gate camps, but lowsec needs a complete overhaul anywhay so why not see what that is firstgetting rid off all the stupid penalties in 0.4 is goodas for 0.0, i like all id<U+FFFD>as except the no sec status thing"
12/25/2008,0.0 is just low-sec without security status loss and without sentries.your ideas for both ls and 0.0 are horrible.
12/25/2008,"1/ shameless bumpage2/ vuk lau, did you ever post your ideas? 3/ titan pilots view required on this please.. :-)"
12/25/2008,"hello all,this is the first in a series of proposals to bring before ccp on the reykjavik meeting. this one is all about the npcs we encounter in missions.it seems at the time that if you enter a mission, you know that group a will have 4 frigates and 2 elite frigates, while group b will have 4 battlecruisers and 2 battleships. this system does not work at all, and should be randomized to give you a bit of a surprise when you enter a mission.the idea behind this part of missions is that ships should be given a 'point cost', and the number and types of ships should then be randomized upon either accepting the mission or going through the previous gate. to avoid any missions too tough for specific formats, there should be limitations, with no more than 75% of the points of any group being set to any specific type of ship.the ship costs are as follows: frigates 1, destroyers 2, cruisers 3, elite frigates 4, battlecruisers 5, elite cruisers 6, battleships 8. therefore, a group with 36 points in it might consist of 4 battlecruisers and 2 battleships, or 4 battleships and an elite frigate, or any other multiple. the level of the mission will also set the maximum ship size you encounter, with level 1 giving ships of 2 or less point value each, level 2 giving 4 or less, level 3 giving 6 or less, and level 4 giving all types.these values are only a sample, and further balancing can be done by ccp's balance and qa teams to get the values right. in either case, they would add more risk and interest in missions. any constructive criticism on this idea is always welcomed."
12/25/2008,we already discussed this with ccp too!
12/25/2008,lol.. gotta love this guy!.
12/25/2008,"and you failed at making this possible? blast, csm sure is useless then."
12/25/2008,"csm brings ideas to ccp.ccp make them possible... your venting at the wrong people, but ah screw it if you think the message boys deal with the development of the game.. you go ahead and think that."
12/25/2008,"players brings ideas to csmcsm presents ideas from players to ccpccp decides if discarding the ideas or not.ideas that didn't get discarded are put on a priority stack depending on ccp mood.ccp makes arcane code magic.ccp fixed the bugs that code magic caused.that's hwo it works, csm isn't much more than a bunch of people that think they are important while they don't.as for the assembly hall, it is a good thing, ccp can take ideas out directly from here, afterall."
12/25/2008,"i've highlighted the partsthank you for showing my point, the csm don't make it possible, they just give the ideas to ccp.if you want results faster, bash ccp.i'm 99% anti csm myself but since they don't really do anything, saying that they didn't make it possible is just warped facts."
12/25/2008,"hello all,this is my third in a series of ideas i would like brought before ccp at the reykjavik meeting. this one focuses on the majority of us who have dropped our faction standings to the point where it's all but impossible to run missions for certain factions, even pirate factions.once a player goes below -2.0 standing with a faction (including skills), he becomes unable to work for said faction at all. what i wish to see is a new series of skills to help the player out with the factions in question.each empire faction will have their own skill, called something like ""gallente rapport"" or something similar. these skills will have a rank of 4, and will each be targeted to one specific faction, with a primary attribute of charisma and a secondary attribute of willpower. each boost will give the player a bonus .4 standing per level with the chosen faction.by using these skills, you can thereby increase your standing to a more reasonable level, allowing you to work with factions that were previously banned to you. the pirate factions may also have a secondary skill, but they already have criminal connections so it's unknown what boost they should have. i leave the rest of this idea to be fleshed out by the players and ccp.this will allow players to, with decent skill training, run missions and slowly rebuild their standings towards factions which more or less hate them. it will also give slightly more purpose to the charisma attribute. constructive criticism is always welcomed."
12/25/2008,very good idea
12/25/2008,"this is not true. i hade a -4.99 towards minmitar, and by running missions missions with a friend (his agent), i increased it back to -1.5. at which point i had enough standing towards that minnie npc corp that i could use their lvl4 q20 agents, and do the rest myself if needed.what i did is the way to do it, this game we love is an mmo, what you propose just encourages more solo play.tl;dr = no"
12/25/2008,"you might have had a negative standing to the corporation, but it is impossible to raise faction standing by sharing in missions. this is an old problem, and unless they changed it without telling anybody, is still a problem."
12/25/2008,sounds unbalanced to me. easily exploitable - why work missions for a faction (work and time) if you can just get the skill and train it (isk and time)?on the other hand.......a concept of bribes to faction officials sounds more realistic.
12/25/2008,ankh already raised an issue about this.
12/25/2008,"a specific improvement here would be to explain the rating scheme.between this character and my alts, i have nine closed petitions so far in this first year of game play. none of those petitions are rated because there is no visible explanation of how the 1 through 10 rating scheme works. for example, is #1 the best rating as in, 'we're #1' or is #10 the best rating as in, 'that woman is a ten!'?so, i have not rated any petition because i have no clue as to the meaning of the rating scheme. my apologies go out to all who have worked on my petitions. i really would like to provide you with a good and fair rating but no one has explained what the numbers mean and, contrary to opinion, my psychic abilities (to include esp) are not in an advanced stage of development.thank you, neresky.-wheat"
12/25/2008,"i support the idea of second chances but why not, instead, make the ded social skill one that can actually be obtained. imagine if you had 1 isk for every npc pirate you terminated."
12/25/2008,the csm is a great start by ccp of creating dialog between itself and the players.the sacrifices of the csm are appreciated and i would prefer that members finish out their terms.i offer each of them this virtual stuffed animal holiday gift as a token of appreciation. perhaps the op could have one as well.keep up the great work csm.
12/25/2008,i appreciate ccp taking idea from players.i don't appreciate csm.here's my appreciation<-----
12/25/2008,"hello all,this is the second in the series of proposals to bring before ccp in reykjavik, this one referring to the 'mission hubs' that everybody both loves and hates.the old days of specific mission hubs being filled with players and mission thieves won't pass away, but they can be diminished somewhat by removing the agent quality modifier. this way, any level 4 agent will be just as effective as any other level 4 agent, with possible exception to the security status of the system. this will also make starting out easier, and allow you to keep the same agent throughout your time at the given level, not having to pack up and move to get better rewards from a higher-quality agent.level 1 agents will be available to everybody with a corporate standing of -2 or higher, while subsequent levels open up at the following standings: * level 2 - standing 1.0 or higher * level 3 - standing 3.0 or higher * level 4 - standing 5.5 or higher * level 5 - standing 8.0 or higherthe agent's rewards - in terms of isk rewards, mission difficulty, and lp rewards - will increase as he grows to trust you more and you do more missions for him. this will slowly coax you into the next level of missions, since your missions will grow more difficult as you successfully complete more of them.another aspect that needs attention is the rampant salvage or loot thieves in the missions. the way i see it, the corporation is hired or petitions concord for responsibility to clean up one outbreak of thieves, and that right passes on to the mission-runner when he accepts the given mission. this means that anybody who is not in your fleet that enters your deadspace immediately starts blinking red as if they had stolen from you or your fleet, even before their first looting or salvage attempt. this gives the player a chance to combat the thieves if he feels powerful enough to defeat them.the values are spaced out to allow for entry into missions from people with adequate experience with ship combat, but still allowing for a fairly rapid progression. constructive criticism is welcomed, and this idea can be modified to make it work better."
12/25/2008,very good idea
12/25/2008,"this does not need to be addressed. this ""mechanic"" currently works as intended and should not be fixed. the simple solution is already in place, do not run missions in systems where everyone else and their cousin is.as to the rest of your idea, it is ok, but a proposal i far more favor is one where agent quality declines if he gets used by a many people, where an agent who does not get used often has his quality increase over time. this would cause people not to all bunch up at the same places, this would encourage more people to move around a bit, this would stimulate new trade hubs, and also cause players to move around eve a bit with the eb and flow of agent quality."
12/25/2008,we already raised a major issue about missions. read the minutes from our last ccp meeting from a few months ago.so that's a nay.
12/25/2008,"if i remember correctly a similar idea was already brought to ccps attention, and they vetoed the idea.edit: beaten by la vista"
12/25/2008,"this just got you my support.easier killing of careless mission runners, hurray!~"
12/25/2008,so you failed because few monts later and still nothing was changed
12/25/2008,"if you think a few months is long enough for ccp to take idea(s) from the csm, think of how to change it, plan it, assign work, get feedback and the whole other things a project like this would take..you fail."
12/25/2008,"and you have some expirience with making and modifying games like eve too? its far less complicated than you think, specially that those decisions are taken by few people on one meeting, then implementing idea which in this case is quite simply and does not need many of ccp's human resources."
12/25/2008,"yeah, because it takes 5 years to do stuff, while ccp is doing fancy walk in station. it's not a csm problem, csm is the problem."
12/25/2008,"it may indeed take 5 years and i dislike the idea of the csm as well. however i know any idea that makes it ingame must go over a logical process (since its software development) and ccp have already showen that not much can be done in a few months. + britney, not for eve no, but software development yes, however since you stated the time frame you must know more about ccp's workload then i do."
12/25/2008,"it would be nicer if the automated handing of medals would be able to be reviewed by directors / ceo before granting them. first off this prevents the corp wallet being drained dry because a lot of triggers went off, and secondly you could tie a history list with some filters to have a corpwide overview of who got what and when."
12/25/2008,"this sounds like rewards based on counter-strike in space. i'm not so sure. while it would decrease the work-load on people, i'm still not a big fan of it."
12/25/2008,"hello all,this is my sixth idea that i would like to present to ccp at the reykjavik meeting. this one deals with adding a niche market to the manufacturing system, making it more complex without presenting an information overload.as it stands, you simply put a blueprint and a handfull of materials into a black-box processor, and out pops a fully assembled ship in a matter of minutes or hours. this idea seeks to change that and open up a niche market for traders to further develop.as i envision it, a ship blueprint will take modules in a similar fashion to how capital ships are built today, and then those modules would be assembled into the final product. the bigger the ship, the more modules of a certain type that would be necessary. the simplest ships would be exempt from this (shuttles).each of these components would need it's own skill to manufacture, opening the niche market i was discussing earlier. without the skills, the units would cost 15% more to make than they currently do, but each level of the skill reduces the material need by 5%, allowing a level 5 in the skill to give a 10% discount on the cost of building the ship. the blueprints could also be researched, giving an even lower material requirement.example: you're building a rifter, and the revised blueprint calls for one engine unit, one armor unit, one electronics unit, and 3 turret units. missile units would be free, since shields would require so many materials. the electronics unit would require the expensive materials (zydrine and megacyte) while the rest of the components would require basic minerals up to nocxium. you can either buy these components off the market or make them yourself.this would increase manufacturing and marketing activities while making manufacturing a little less of a one-step process. constructive criticism is always welcomed."
12/25/2008,"if these new ""components"" take up more volume than the minerals required to build them, like cap ship components. this will just further fuel the logistical nightmare that large scale t1 builders have.also while this may help out some people, i think you should expect that large scale t1 builders will not outsource this production, they will instead just add another building alt or two to their accounts.i have to say no to this idea without further details."
12/25/2008,"i was thinking the components could take up about 100 m3 each, allowing frigates to transport them if necessary. about the manufacturing alts, this isn't designed to be a preventative measure against big business, and they're more than welcome to create those alts if they want the advantage, giving ccp even more accounts. seems like a win-win situation, honestly."
12/25/2008,bad idea
12/25/2008,"new skill or function in the ceo/alliance management panel allowing corp/alliance owned vessels to be self destructed by the ceo/alliance leader in the event of unauthorized removal of vessels. the function might include a link in the insurance panel of listed insured vessels issued to the corp/alliance.some benefits include :1.greater unity within alliances/corporation to maintain corp/alliance owned fleets and encourage unity among members in fleet maintenance.2.a broader financial and personal investment base within corp/alliance members. 3.corp/alliance members would be more unified in building their corp/alliance fleets as opposed to the singular purpose of personal ship maintenance of individuals.3. recruitment and continued corp membership enticements in that a corp/alliance would be able to exercise greater control over their fleets and be able to provide ships to members without the worry of unauthorized removal of ships.4. greater sense of focus amongst corp/alliance member goals in their mining, mission running ops etc. in obtaining materials to build these fleets.ora gps device installed on corp/alliance ships under the ceo/alliance management panel(possible insurance panel link ) that would show the location of the ship, unless it was destroyed and then the gps device would function only for a given period of time.device would also allow the destruction of the ship by other pilots even if the pilot left the corp/alliance and without intervention from npc police or the need to declare war if the pilot joined another corp/alliance. this would at least provide some deterrent to unauthorized removal of ships and give the ""ships owners"" a reasonable period of time in which to seek out and destroy the ship."
12/25/2008,"currently war declaration cost are not in keeping with other cost in the game.for example: it cost 5m isk to create a medal and another 5m isk to award it to a player. the cost of giving medals is high in order to keep dumb medals from being produced and awarded. yet the cost of declaring war is 2m for corporations and then the cost is a little higher for up to 3 wars.it's as though ccp isn't comparing cost across the board when making decisions. let's get ""dumb"" war declarations out of the game as well and make the cost of declaring war an expensive proposition.my suggestion is start the cost of corporate wars at 20m isk. it's a figure that will at least cause some thought before a war declaration is created."
12/25/2008,"make it 15m and only +5m for each other war, and then we have a deal"
12/25/2008,some ppl post with a alt because their personal opinion may differ from the official opinion of their corp/alliance.their are already rules about trolling/bad language if it is done by alts or not and as such no other filters are needed.
12/25/2008,no sorry there is no way ccp are giving you free officer modules in 1.0
12/25/2008,"wat part of ""low sec"" do you not get?"
12/25/2008,"i would like to see cruiser sized officer spawns in low sec - not the current battleship spawns. they would give cruiser sized officer mods.of course these spawns would be easy to kill, but their rarity and value would make more people venture into low sec. it means more pvp and more reward. some people may even learn to survive in low sec and like it.we all know low sec rewards totally suck compared to risks. 0.0 is much safer than low sec (thanks to jump bridges)"
12/25/2008,no
12/25/2008,"i'm new to the whole csm duties thing, but are you meant to represent the players voice or make decisions for them?"
12/25/2008,"i think low end ores are for high sec. low sec is a joke, unwanted space, home for pirates. so u shouldnt be able to mine in low sec in the first place. the drone regions are ment for a constant supply for all sorts of ores to keep the prices low of medium ores like nox and iso. 0.0 space is lawless space. best way to make isk is still ratting. i can make 40m easy per hour in my own. mining in 0.0 solo gives me the same. that includes warping out every 25min to get my bs ship en hauling the ore every 2 hours. im only mining mercoxit because only that comes close to ratting. if i want to mine properly i need atleast a corp mate with me to kill the rats. that allows me to make 55 mil per hour (mercoxit only) but that need to be split in 2. that gives me a radical idea. mining veldspar in 0.0 is insane anyway so lets remove the low end ores out of the systhems that have a true sec of -0.90 and higher (example -0.95) and let more high end ore spawn because people there are mining the high ends only anyway that occeur only there. in return of that, hauler spawns need to spawn more in systhems that have a npc station so people will bother to haul the 75 milion trit and dump it on the market. next thing is to reduce the spawn frequenty of npc's in those -0.90 and higher systhems so people can make more isk each hour and it will be more profitable to mine in 0.0. this will cause that the high end ores will go down. high end ores are expensive these days in high sec. i know that there are only a few -0.90 true sec systems, ratters have plenty of other systems to rat in. third thing that need to be adjusted is the yield of the high en ores. it's too low, i can still make more isk per hour by ratting (exept mining mercoxit). why do i mine if i can shoot some easy rats? there is only one answere possible that is called isk. if i can make 60m or 70mil per hour mining i go mine instead of ratting. 60m /70m per hour should be the rate that u should be earning by mining in the best mining systems there are. in the end it turns around 2 things in 0.0 fun (pew pew) and the way to support it. at this moment ratting is more rewardfull then mining. but ratting doesnt fund the eve economy ."
12/26/2008,"""to the victor belong the spoils."" -1831 new york senator, william l. marcythe programmers have a tough job with this. yet, it should be addressed and i am pleased that ccp has committed to doing so.i propose that players who loot and salvage the property of others incur a substantial security hit. if they wish to behave lawlessly then let them be lawless in low sec. living in a society requires some restraint. those who choose to not show restraint will move themselves ever nearer to banishment. then pirates will have their day."
12/26/2008,buying and selling characters is exactly the type of activity used by the scammers who have people opposed to the whole concept. if anything character sales should be outlawed completely in favor of name changes.
12/26/2008,"___the initial thread is nearly one and a half years old (started by nyphur, and you should at least parse the op), and a full possible implementation was summarized (and analyzed to some degree) by me less than a week later here in the same thread.___even assuming absolutely no change would be made to mission loot drops (or rogue drone alloy drops, or any other drops for that matter), changes which are strongly encouraged (but a matter for another time), the general consensus is that the current way of mineral distribution in the ores, and the way ores are spread in the galaxy are not really all that good at all.___long story short (for the long story, read that thread), the idea is to totally revamp the way minerals are obtained in systems of various security ratings :* asteroids would no longer have a single ore type (some could even have all ore types, some could still have just one)* all possible ores would be available in all possible system security ratings* the density of each individual ore (m^3 of individual ore vs total m^3 of ore in the rock) in the asteroid belts would be determined by system security rating mainly (and region secondarily, with some degree of randomness added)* the mining speed (in m^3/cycle) would be variable depending on the density of the ore in the mined asteroid* normal mining would extract ore volumes proportional to the density (with round-downs for integer ore units)* mining crystals and deep core mining would provide ways to mine specific ores faster and/or exclusively out of a mixed-ore rock___what this means is yes, you could mine arkonor in a 1.0 system... but you would only get 1-3 units of arkonor per deep core stripminer cycle if you used t2 arkonor mining crystals there, and got none if you tried to use a stripminer, unless the asteroid would be heavily depleted already, and no chance of getting any at all with a regular deep core miner (let alone a t2 miner).it also means you could probably get many times more veldspar in a 0.0 system than you could get in a 0.5 system, and that on top of other, better ore.basically, it allows every sufficiently skilled and well-equipped miner to obtain all kinds of minerals in any security rating system just from mining, while at the same time allowing for much finer ""regional imbalances"" in mineral prices to stimulate inter-region trade while not having to succumb to the current acute tritanium shortage (more precisely, the insane added cost on tritanium due to logistics issues).the possibilities are endless, and the system is easily tweakable after implementation (you only need to tweak the respawn densities and spreads of ores in asteroids of a certain region).___a series of other changes are interesting, yet not mandatory for the above system, and could be either added at a later date or completely ignored. those include:* much larger asteroids, spread across larger distances in the same grid, or even a single large asteroid per grid* ore scanners and some ship bonuses revamped to allow different grades of ore detection on a locked asteroid* optionally, higher-grade ore could only be extracted if detected, and scanning could be mandatory for detection* asteroid ""belts"" with one rock per grid spanning many grids (with several empty grids in between), with ore scanners as means to detect and warp to other grids containing rocks* asteroids could be composed of different layers, with outer layer being mineable by all means, middle layer only by strip and deep core miners, inner layer only mineable by deep core miners (and quantity/density/value of ore would be differentiated betwen layers)___well... ?"
12/26/2008,"which there has been the last few patches. probably to assist dr. e in detailing how much of an effect mission lewt has on the economy. ironically the drone mission lewt was hit the worse + orca creation and tbh almost no significant change overall has changed relative to mission lewts.ya in real life an asteroid can be primarily say ice or iron or nickel... but isnt entirely that. the survey scanners should be able to scan and give you rough ideas of what roids are composed of... but not %ages. so it says veldspar-kernite. could be 99% veld; could be 99% kern.except merx since it has the dangerous cloud deal related;nah. chance for a rock to provide any ark in 1.0 should be like 1 in 1,000,000 and even the the available amount to be mined would be nearly nothing.something like a planet's ring system for mining? or a system wide belt; an asteroid belt much like asteroid_belt where you warp in and then essentially need to nano around for bookmarks to find spots to mine. would be au lengthed; instead of say 30km length. lots and lots of space between the roids."

12/26/2008,"yes, mining need a big revamp. the loot reprocessing is a thorny problem. beside some post by ccp saying that the % of minerals coming from reprocessing is not so high we don't have real data but only very rough guesstimates. removing the loot unnamed from missions/rat spawns, even without any form of compensation, would heavily shift the isk/material ratio in the mission rewards, with inflationary effects. any form of compensation will have further inflationary effect if isk based or devaluate rapidly (like it happened for the lp) if it is in the form of more named loot. honestly i don't see a easy solution to that problem."

12/26/2008,"i thought of this before and it was mentioned during fanfest 2008. from what i remember, ccp had also considered the idea but didn't know how to implement it. the hangup may have been lack of cargo hold space in the drones themselves and then the transfer of items from the drones to the ship hold. yet, mining drones have no trouble transferring ore to a ship hold. one player may have mentioned the drones salvaging with the loot being dropped into a can -just like what happens now when players salvage a wreck before looting it. it seems that the proposed salvage drone could, at least, carry salvage if not loot.perhaps then, there could be two types of salvage related drones, 1) a rover drone to fetch your remote wrecks for you -functioning like a tractor beam with very long reach, and 2) a mosquito drone which only extracts the yummy good stuff (i.e. salvage) and brings it back. :) thinking of the multi-tasking makes my head spin."
12/26/2008,this hasnt happened because they tried already and it didnt work.some people even have this trained.it was a technical game engine thing.though they would be nice wouldnt they.
12/26/2008,"i respectfully disagree with my representative.although on the surface the reduction of lag times is worthy and indeed a great necessity, it cannot be the be all and end all of a request for augmented functionality. the reductio would that the models for space frames in the new eden universe could be faithfully represented by replacing the existing models with graphics containing only 10% of the polygons that make up any particular space frame in eve. that would efficiently reduce lag by a major factor.the downside would obviously be a severely reduced user experience because there would be very little in the way of eye candy left. clearly, this is not the answer.on bandwidth. the giant brains at cern in geneva are going to turn on the lhc in the coming months. this will generate data in the peta byte range. earlier, tim berners-lee designed the world wide web, at cern. to transport data in the range that the lhc is going to churn out the grid was conceived. seeing as www is ubiquitous technology it is not a gigantic leap of the imagination to assume that the grid too will change the way people think about data transfer. ccp, as constructors of a mmog are natural customers for this kind of technology. it bears to look beyond the immediate consequences of the current economic collapse and see a future where cheap, ubiquitous and truly massive data traffic is as common as veldspar.imagine rather a future in which corporations will be able to research modifications to existing ship configurations. this will effectively change the properties by which any given space frame operates, with the concomitant changes to the physical appearance of the space frame, its new abilities and limitations, its changed construction requirements and the ability of the corporation responsible for its design to add their livery to it so as to differentiate it from other ships on the market. obviously subject to the staggering cost implications inherent to any worthy project undertaken in new eden.this will enable operators in the game to have an impact on the shape and the feel of the universe and by imbuing it with their creativity and inspirations, give it greater depth, a richer feel, and establishing it as a living, breathing entity that evolves over time. this way eve will have an opportunity to become more than the sum of its parts, it may gain culture which will set it aside from every other such enterprise focused on creating a revenue stream. it will become a preferred third place where ideas have the potential of being realized.my professional experience in the software industry gives me an indication of practical limits to what can be so achieved. i certainly don't want to give the impression that i believe that 'everything should be possible', that goal is unrealistic and will lead to unwanted, sub optimal outcomes. within the confines of what mere code can achieve however, features can be implemented that give the eve resident greater freedom to steer their own destiny. any universe that can strike the right balance between the freedoms of what a user can do in the atmosphere the designers envisioned, will create an environment people care passionately about. this leads to greater user retention, a robust revenue stream that enable the implementation of new technologies for the constructor and, for the user a world where goals can be achieved which, in that great, urbane fiction called 'real life' may not be as readily attainable.let us look beyond a mere limitation in datan data loads today and see a brighter future in the undiscovered countryabulurd bonifaceme meceo"
12/26/2008,"since ships are techinically already being painted (the base textures are grey, and gallente ships get a blue-ish accent to certain parts of the hull in game), i don't think this is much work to implement.even back in 1997 you could dye every piece of clothing you wore in ultima online, and that was in the days of the 56k modem, so bandwidth is not an issue."
12/26/2008,in all honesty for performance reasons i dont think ship painting wouldbe a good idea i can only see this going as far as a corporate/alliance logos on the side of a ship.i will not support this for now as i think there are many other more important things that need to be done at the moment.
12/26/2008,you didn't have often the best part of 1000 people on screen at same time though. even if you have a little check box to hide the custom colours that data will still have to be sent to each client. in an multi-alliance sized megablob it'll add up fast.
12/26/2008,painted ships are great.... but it will severely increase the latency on the server.when you jump in... your client has to load up every single ship on the grid within visual range.ever notice that slight pause when you warp in?duh!yes... it would be great... but the only thing i want to see is corporate logos and alliance logos on ships.at least that's something that can be cached into the client.colorization of ships would put a heavy load on it.i'm all for it... but this could be costly.
12/26/2008,i think this is a great idea.nothing like getting destroyed by a pirate in a pink ship.whom unknownly to you also has a cargo hold full of exotic dancers.
12/26/2008,"it would not increase server lag, as the data it would require would simply be no more then a few bits, basicly equal to a little bit of notes on playersall the lag would be client side.and as stated earlier it would be something you can turn off.that pause is your computer, not the serveri'm also in favor of the logos."
12/26/2008,"he already said u can turn it off.add'd what you suggesting is no different then any alliance ""a"" settting up a mix'd fleet of ships on fire."
12/26/2008,"it's important to note that overview settings are just the tip of the iceberg. i couldn't care less about audio/graphic settings, but as namorham pointed out, window placement, bookmark folders (i still don't get why bookmarks are stored server side and folders client side...) and market quickbar items & folders are equally important."
12/26/2008,supported as long as they actually test the feature and fuzz input validation.
12/26/2008,technically doable by going into the cache files for your client.c:\documents and settings\administrator\local settings\application data\ccp\eve\c_program_files_ccp_eve_tranquilitywhy they couldnt write the code to export the files. even using perhaps the logserver as the tool instead of the game.
12/26/2008,we demand a transparent investigation of this exploit!
12/26/2008,"signed.names, alliances, amounts, total isk. it should all be in the records, so let's see it."
12/26/2008,"it's too bad that then that the purpose of the assembly hall was apparently not clearly defined or thought out from the onset.if it helps to make the forum less of the monster it has become then, yes, i'm for it. i wonder how the damage can be undone."
12/26/2008,"i partially support this, the intent of the csm is act as a conduit between players and ccp. so only allowing a few people(csm members) to start threads would probably render the original intent a moot point.however i do feel that there should be more moderation to weed out all the troll and whine threads or move them to their appropriate area. alternately new ideas for ships, low sec, sov, etc, should be initially posted and ""approved"" in the features and ideas discussion of the forums. so maybe put the thumbs up/down function for the features and ideas discussion of the forums perhaps?either way i agree, something probably should be done."
12/26/2008,firstly support up or down means nothing. look at treelox... he is negative on everything. there are others who support everything.ps response to this thread is at bottom.it really isnt. features and ideas is there just as a place to trash topics ccp doesnt solicit. virtually nothing you can think up... hasnt been thought up by ccp. there are loads of ideas that are good and ccp would love to do them... but they dont have a strong enough gfx department or whatever to do it.then ccp found the effect of anything they say there becomes so effect. one ccp might say... hey that's a good idea. then everyone thinks it's going to happen. or if the ccp dumps the idea... who do they blame? ccp is who.create csm as the buffer. csm says it's a good idea... doesnt mean it's going to happen. csm says it's a bad idea... csm get the blame. ccp lives on. csm doesnt get voted back.csm does its purpose. ccp is going to do what ccp does. nothing is going to change it. features nor csm.now you have this thread. i say no because if you have an issue you want brought up... what csm is going to post it and see what happens? just bringing up the idea might mean no getting csm back. if all ideas are going to be posted through a csm anyway... all you do is serve to throw up a gauntlet ideas have to run through and make the lazy not care; meaning good ideas dont make it through.how about another csm-only post area where they do as you say... and they skim assembly hall for ideas to post; give their idea on it. then we the peanut gallery can comment there.
12/26/2008,"makes sense... the two subforums were kind of redundant as they are right now anyway.speaker's corner for rough drafts of ideas, assembly hall for official preliminary versions only.but... meh... i don't know... oh well, 75% support anyway"
12/26/2008,"as for a lot of poster, partially supported.generally you get better discussion about an idea in the relevant forums (i.e. the market forum for an idea that impact the market, science and industry when you speak of mining and so on). on the other hand this is the forum for voting ideas to present before the csm and then ccp and limit the suggested ideas to what the csm propose is counterproductive. probably a stronger moderation of the forum, were duplicating thread are referenced to the main thread on the argument and closed would make it better. to that add a better browser capable of restricting the search on a topic to a single section of the forum so that you can check if a argument was already proposed without tons of false positives."
12/26/2008,evelopedia would work here also.create a csm category.create the different issues as different articles and pop them into that category. the talk page then can be used by the csms and others to comment on the article.perhaps i will index some basic ideas and proposals that are good and toss them up there.edit/ just noticed there is already a csm category.
12/26/2008,i knew it was only a matter of time before some fascist ideology would get proposed here for the sole purpose of shutting up the people.no no no a thousand times no
12/26/2008,"before adding more, how about allowing players to block the sounds they don't like -like certain in game audio tracks?"

12/26/2008,why?
12/26/2008,this. really bad troll attempt...
12/26/2008,granted it'd bee very cool but why why why would ccp do it?
12/26/2008,"with out any answer to the ""why?"" i can not support this idea. tl:dr = noi am so glad you care. i actually often give thumbs up to many an issue here. unfortunetly, for you i say ""no"" to yours. maybe if your issues had a sense of balance or reasoning to them, i could vote in affirmation for them. case in point this idea you bring us in this thread, while it may be ""cool"", why should it be in game, what benifit, balance, problem or concern does it fix/improve?"
12/26/2008,"1. replaces jita. jita right now was designed as a system. it had an ice belt, agents, everything. ccp is trying to slowly streamline jita but every boost only leads to jita getting crushed further. it's an endless system. improve it so it can hold 2000 people and 2500 will want into jita.1.1 this would be a pure station system. would have a few stargates; if 1 isnt found to be enough and congesting. maybe a star.. but would be even more cool if the system was a lone station in space.2. creates a place to trade capitals safely. including supercapitals. currently if chribba, glory be upon the greatone, were to get a life, or lose his life(fsm forbid); or whatever. trading supercapitals would be impossible basically. among other things which use his 3rd party service.2.1 contracts more or less show where you build your capitals. you can build in low sec station. sell there; but the pos builders have a risk factor which means they may want to jump to another low sec system to sell; but where?2.2 lets say i buy in oulley. would anyone in providence want to buy my carrier? even with maximum skills that takes 3 jumps. base skills is 5 jumps. that's with a carrier and not stopping by stations.2.3 this makes it so everyone in those situations get it in 1 jump. much more easy.3. jump freighters currently cant jump in high sec. meaning high sec logistics are only slightly slower.3.1 when you create a market where lots of products can move in fast, while not so fast in out. this creates a high competition market. which jita currently doesnt have. often times you can find better deals outside jita. trust me this is a good thing. jumpfreighter traders have the ability to pull off the market in citadel and jump to this system to unload for a profit even if it's 1% they will do it.3.2 same effect can be seen in real life. go buy a pair of pants downtime in your city in a high density area. you pay 200% markup. goto the walmart in the suburb and u pay nothing.4. this strengthens the dead area of high sec and low sec. people can go to the dead areas that are like 15 jumps from any trade up. amarr space has lots of these system; gallente have solitude etc etc.4.1 they can build in those areas, jump right to this system. unload their product; bring back ammo and such things to populate the mission hub in their area.4.2 take solitude for example. 5 jumps through bubbled 0.0, or 20 jumps through low sec. has a pretty good mission hub there in my opinion. due to it being so dead you can make isk off the mission runners by buying their minerals/mods. moving meta 4 to this system. building whatever. moving whatever the mission runners dont touch. the belts might be untouched so lots of mining to be had. solitude would get a huge boost from this. alternative ccp could come around and say naaah lets leave solitude in its solitude."
12/26/2008,i thought masternerdguy had the worst ideas.
12/26/2008,"wall'o'text.1. jita has been a problem for long. moving that problem somewhere else is not the solution.2. ""trade safely""? die in the burning hell, we don't need a 100% safe system where you can jump capitals in and out.chribba and other supercapital trader are just players. it will be possible to trade supercapitals after the veldspar runs out of eve and our veldspar overlord gets depressed and cut himself with rocky scrissors (made of dense veldspar). they're a great community reference, they're great and all. they're still players.3. again, no!. jumpfreighters are suppsoed to be the only capital capable of jumping in-between high-sec and ls/0.0 with the sole drawback of being dumb****tastically slow.4. sage...ermh, i mean safe trade doesn't belong to eve. we have a market, that's all the ""safe"" you can have. adding more will just unbalance the current gameplay to a point where it wouldn't be funny anymore.tl;dr -> op is a troll."
12/26/2008,"in all seriousness though, what would happen if, g-d forbid, chribba suddenly wasnt around anymore.we take his being here for granted, i think, and we really do need some sort of backup just in case."
12/26/2008,"cloning technology should become main stream in a few decades. chribba lives in one of the more enlightened countries in the world. he should have a high life expectancy, if he can overcome the depression that is a natural companion of people who for a great part of the year are deprived of sufficient daylight.to answer op, bottlenecks are a natural phenomenon everywhere people congregate. some aspect of a location will draw the attention of many people seeking an advantage. everywhere masses of people convene problems arise, we're that kind of species. in a virtual environment it only means we're trying to find a balance to what the system can deliver.the answer is not to have a super concord system.the answer is, and it gives me great pleasure to find it here as i type, so that the greater eve community may benefit: an extra stargate in jita that connects directly to for instance [with great emphasis on the 'for instance' part so as to prevent the whaaaaaaambulance from being started] arnola system in derelik. this is 0.5 space, bordering on nul-sec in the great wildlands and could become the nul-sec equivalent of jita. this would off-load the pressure on jita and give the nul-sec traders a place to trade in the relative safety of 0.5 space guarded by concord. conversely, some nul-sec system might be upgraded to 0.5 space, with some concord protection. it's the same idea with a slightly different twist.obviously i would not propose anything as preposterous as asking for an actual safe place to trade. goodness gracious me, imagine the idea. at the same time brisk trading at the border of nul sec in an environment where the murderous butchers that normally express their lack of empathy at gate camps were held at arms-length, would provide an opportunity for business to bloom in low-security zones, with direct access to empire space. this would facilitate the transfer of goods from low-sec to high-sec and vice versa and have the added benefit of shifting some of the burden that is now on jita to another trade hub.it's a win-win situation, it makes perfect sense, there is no shadow of a hope that it will be implemented. at least we'll be able to kvetch about lag in jita for a few decades longer.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"

12/26/2008,"i have been increasingly alarmed with a trend we are seeing: moderators are locking threads without explaining why, leave alone even leaving a post in the thread.that means we have threads, which were otherwise quite ok, being locked without any idea about why! was it because the user requested it? was it a cross-post? etc.this really needs to stop. the moderation team needs more well-defined rules for when and how to lock a thread."
12/26/2008,without knowing the training standards ccp has for its moderators its pretty hard to tell who is and whom isnt doing their job. i work in a customer service industry and we have criteria for getting jobs done a certain way. if ccp does not already have a policies and procedures document for moderation i highly suggest they get one and have staff review it on a regular basis. it is not difficult to put a single sentence as to why and sign the post. no need to go into the whys or wherefores. this would greatly help against the undercurrent of thought that the mods are brainless monkeys doing the bidding of whom ever reports a thread.edit - added support.
12/26/2008,i do think that if a thread is to be moderated that the mods should leave their mark.are they being lazy? or is it a lack of codification in procedure?
12/26/2008,well at least they should notify that thread is being locked and for what reasons. if that's what happening then it shouldn't happen.
12/26/2008,"i have noticed this and i was puzzled... thought maybe something changed.not to mention a good deal of them arent even being signed by who does it. simply...

12/26/2008,100% approved so far. thanks again guys o/
12/26/2008,oh god the horrors. i tried a tale in the desert waaaay back. i was scarred.think about what you're proposing though.you really want miners to be watching the game making decisions and such on the fly like pvpers do...every 3 minutes of a cycle. oh god the horror. it'd be like watching paint or cement dry... and i've been the low man on the pole and have had those jobs before. wait a second those jobs were pretty fun compared to current mining.lets not kill the soul of the soulless miners already.
12/26/2008,"yup. a mini-game every 3 minutes? or a tedious min/max process that a bot could easily handle? no thanks.big no to throwing a flimsy band-aid on a very sore problem. mining needs a total rework in lots of areas. mining is boring, not very competitive and gives too little/too much isk depending on where you live.nothing less than a total rework will do i'm afraid."
12/26/2008,"i'm going to echo what lvv and ve said above and say ""that's not only unnecessary, but also not nearly enough"".a total mining revamp proposal is sitting around for nearly a year and a half now : linkagenobody bothered to change or refine it for the past 16 months.granted, it's not the most clever revamp, but it should give you a general idea of what would be needed.and no, minigames that are best macro'd instead of played isn't ""it""."

12/26/2008,"so, you propose making mining arguably one of the most painfuly boring parts of eve, go from a semi afk activity to requiring the player to be alert at the keyboard just to be able to produce a decent yield? that is a fate i would not wish on anyone.this would be a step in the wrong direction.."

12/26/2008,yeah. this needs to be done.
12/26/2008,"a triaged hel with 5 reps in the high and a triage mod will add about 25k dps tank to a dread each. unfortunately in this setup the hel has 0 tank. most regular mses will usually only have one, maybe two reps depending on the ms. this means 5/8k extra dps tank. even with 10 mses this is only 50-80k dps (about 12/20 dreads worth of damage) and leaves the mses very vulnerable.triage mods should not prevent the carrier/ms from being repped, but should not increase the local rep power either. also i like mses being able to rep through siege mods but don't really see the point of making it triage only."
12/26/2008,lets say we drop the triage option and plainly give mom the ability to break through the ew of the sieged dreads.dont you think that's a little bit overpowered or would you think in the nature of current capital warfare that might include moms... the potential dread dps would overpower the moms anyway?next point is...if the mom can break through the siege module ew; while triaged. why do you think there would be a difference for the triage module ew.disallowoffensivemodifiers = 1it's identical to each module. so if break through on 1 of them. it breaks through on both.so theoretically triaged moms can rr each other. that would be pretty good.
12/26/2008,"the idea, i am not opposed to it.here's another...why not make ""the council of stellar management portal page"" an actual portal. a complaint i have about the portal, in the current arrangement, is the lack of ability to contact csm representatives from within it. it is not a portal at all but rather a dead end. creating a link within the portal to the csm forum area is a solution to please more than just one party.another way to get more visits is to make the forums as user friendly as possible by means of increased forum moderation -in particular, by reducing the number of forum categories. if this does not happen, the csm forums will soon be just as monsterous and overwhelming as the rest of the eve-online website."

12/26/2008,"and that has to do with cargo containers being too small how? i know jetcans were never intended for mining, and i don't use them myself. the secure cans that they recommend are practically useless with the yields that miners now gain. i'm just trying to give miners something small that will help them in their quest for minerals in order to keep them involved with the activity.i know mining needs a complete overhaul, and i anticipate it's reincarnation. for now, i'm just trying to give miners a way to stay active without giving them an i win button. if that is wrong, tell me how?"

12/26/2008,"i don't think they should be disbanded just yet. i believe it just needs more time before we know for sure.the voter turnout has been incredibly low but i'm uncertain if it's due to lack of interest, general playerbase game issues not being addressed, or still a new feature."

12/26/2008,you should take a break from this game....seriously.
12/26/2008,please do not move the focus away from the issue.
12/26/2008,"i agree, you are taking a game too seriously. and hang on... i recall ccp stated that scamming was legal.. so you are wasting a gms time on something that is allowed in the current mechanics. no wonder they limited the number of petitons that you could make."
12/26/2008,yes scamming is leagal but spamming is not and that is what i am petitioning the scammers for.
12/26/2008,by spamming gms? oh the irony.
12/26/2008,"you're still wasting customer support time on a technicality, jita will always be full of spam scamming or otherwise."
12/26/2008,ccp has made the rule that spam is not allowed. if they don't want people to petition about spam they should remove it!
12/26/2008,"could you link proof to this ""rule"" against spamming?"
12/26/2008,"you can do whatever you want, and ccp can take steps to limit you wasting their time. a thoughtful person might take the hint."
12/26/2008,sorry don't want to spend time looking for it but i can tell you that before i just warned people about the scammers in jita but then they petitioned me for spam and i got a warning from a gm. then afterwards i kept petitioning the scammers for spamwhen they spammed.
12/26/2008,stop wasting ccp's time.
12/26/2008,yes.if the graphics show that my gallente battle cruisers has 14 turrets -yet the ship fitment tool shows only seven... something is wrong.
12/26/2008,"i can't imagine anyone ever needing more than 64kb of ram...having made use of multi-core, 64 bit capable cpus and oss since '05... i say, let's not stop with just a 64 bit client but let us also make use of multiple cpu cores as well.during fanfest 2008, reference to stackless i/o in the client was made and indication was given that it is coming. it is my understanding that a 64 bit os is a requirement for this feature."
12/26/2008,i believe ccp have answered this question before the server is running on 64bit but they can not develop a 64bit client because some of the things the client needs to run are 32bit and do not have a 64bit version so until that changes there will not be a 64bit eve clientoh and for wheatgrass information stackless io has been implemented oh and to the multi core point if i remember ccp have said they can not do that as it would require them to rewrite the whole code that the client is wrote in
12/26/2008,"i run on an intel quadcore 2.66ghz with 4gb ram and windows xp 64 bit and my cpu use never goes above 10%, while usually hovering around 5%. memory use is around 400mb. while i do have a crash sometimes, i don't have any performance issues.the only way i can make my computer break a sweat is by playing dwarf fortress.so i think there are other problems, and not the eve client.off topic, but i had to build my own assembly code calculator to handle larger values because it's not enough for the game i'm making"
12/26/2008,"grouping of non-weapon systems... yeai cannot see enjoying freedom while, at the same time, deny it to others. so, i won't be biased about the ninja salvagers in this instance. i'd just like to group my mining lasers.---it's a good thing we're all here to make sure that the programmers have something to do."
12/26/2008,being able to add and exclude tracks would be nice.
12/26/2008,you mean when it is changing to the mission music? the regular jukebox stops and then the mission song starts when you warp into a mission.
12/26/2008,"the current security status system is a bit broken tbh, here is my idea:when you attack someone, you become red-flashy for an hour.killing them adds another 23 hours.podding them adds 6 days of red-flashy fun.this is persistent, so logging off will not stop the timer, and it builds up. killing 40 people will deny you access to high sec for 40 days, for example. pirates who are killing alot of people may find themselves locked out for a very very long time, and perhaps there should be a cap on it of 100 days maximum. this number would appear where you security status currently shows up.reducing this number could be done by paying concord 10mil per day. this way, people who currently enjoy high security status will not be able to pirate and zip back to empire 15 minutes later to mission run it back. does not make sense for the police to forgive you in 15 minutes. also pirates do not have to grind rats in 0.0 to be allowed back into empire, they simply have to stop their criminal activities for a while.yes?"
12/26/2008,this idea has probably been said before. but oh well.
12/26/2008,i like it the way it is -even after having gotten down to the last 1 & 1/2 battle ships in one of my very first level 4 combat missions.i was booted off of the server due to the scheduled down time and was not up for starting back from square one the next day. i bailed out of that mission. i was in a battle cruiser and had already lost one to the mission. the word sucks comes to mind.
12/26/2008,ccp will not change the time that the downtime happens because it is designed to help the devs not players
12/26/2008,"you failits doable,the test server had many downtimes around 01:00 or 02:00 am gmt so 12hrs after regular tq downtimeits some logic behind that kind of proposal because euro players pays more than us players cause 1 euro > 1 dollar. if you paying more then you want more"
12/26/2008,1. most of our chars chose our attributes when we didnt have a clue what they did.2. how about a 1 time deal available @ all the school stations that allows you to reselect attributes.2.1. even at a steap cost i would still do it.3. yes i know they spoke about this at the panel.protip:charismaintelligenceperceptionmemorywillpowerpush ccp! start here by supporting.
12/26/2008,i support this fully a 1 time deal sounds great
12/26/2008,"the only way i would support this is if there was a maximum age of the character to use this service. otherwise, we'd have people building high per/will/cha characters and training them up as high as they want, then using the service and focusing on int/mem for the other skills. this would be a character farmer's wet dream, and would be highly open to exploit.maybe 2 months max age would work, but otherwise it would prove to be more of a handicap to the game than an asset, regardless of the cost to do this. in fact, due to the newness of characters required if my above statement is agreed to, the cost should be negligible.sorry, but i cannot support this idea in good faith."
12/26/2008,"corps with 8.0-9.0 standing for example have no basis. i propose the option of building high sec outposts.you can only build outposts in systems without any current stations obviously. have the 8.0 relate to 0.5 space and 9.0 to 0.6with appropriate restrictions... such as you cant restrict docking to anyone and it's free to dock. basically make it like normal high sec stations.my idea is somewhere here. it's basically the removal of gate guns because they are just burdens. instead create concord navy spawns in low sec similar to that of high sec faction navy spawns. tankable, destroyable, and not necessarily bad.it creates the 2 sides.. pirates vs antipirates who allow corps and such to join concord as anti-pirates and those interested can declare war on concord(for free) to be pirates. the change would be increased security for those in asteroid belts and such for example... but wouldnt be overpowering.also creates a system like fail warfare for the pirates vs anti-pirates who then dont have to work with naps and such. they become a team who could organize the area. vs antipirates who organize.this sounds like a nerf to 0.0. not to mention it would be a bit game breaking. the sec status boost is a derived standing. if i'm doing missions in amarr space... why should i break my minnie standing if i dont shoot minnie?pirates vs pirates is rare; because pirates are shabby and worthless. wont happen sorry.they already do this in a roundabout way; even then... i'm not paying 10% tax to amarr empire if i kill a 10,000 bounty rat. so it sounds kind of odd.sov 3 and 4 should be the 0.0 melding area. you have the option of paying concord to protect your sovereign space... and not the weak sort of concord... the instapwn kind. would cost a fair bit. probably something cva would be interested in doing. only way around it would be wardec obviously.brings wardec mechanics to 0.0already exists ingame @ sov 2 ??? with delay of 1.5mins and minimum scan deviation of 15km. originally im told it was planned to have it detect cloaked ships but i think it's not technically possible."
12/26/2008,constellation sovereignty should allow you to rename those stupid names out in 0.0; ccp probably has naming doctrine out there for things... to keep iwannabanana stations from existing... but whatever.
12/26/2008,"the logic that most ppl have for this has to do with ship hp boost that occured with revlations, and yet gate gun dps remained the same."
12/26/2008,"if i remember correctly, the hp boost was put into place to make combat last longer. a 25% boost to tech 1 battleship hp in the rev patch doesn't change sentry guns terribly. rigs and boosters have made tanks fairly stronger.but sentry guns are still a huge force. i have killed quite a few solo pirate bs with sentry aggro in my trusty bc, watch some eve videos and you will see sentrys being an incredible advantage, i mean for one if you have sentry aggro you cannot use anything fast or speed tanked or ewar within 150km of the gate; that is a huge disadvantage. if you must, maybe a +10-15% increase on gate gun dps but really who cares.i approve of the system scanner array for 0.0 alliances. oh wait, that is already in the game? riiiight, lol @ the op. have you even lived in 0.0 for an extended period of time?"
12/26/2008,no.
12/26/2008,to be fair... the array is fairly new and not in wide use in all sov systems; and u need to be in the pos(to which u may not have password for) if there is one anyway. i have a feeling he meant it more like something like directional scanners that all ships have except in sov 0.0 the owners have 999 au directional scanners that will lock on.
12/26/2008,"at least you didn't make yourself look like you have no idea what you're talking about.oh, wait...."
12/26/2008,no. its pretty apparent you have no idea what 0.0 is all about with this post. thumbs down x2--isaac
12/26/2008,"if people cannot gain security status in 0.0, then how do the people that have become outlaws in empire get their sec status back up again?"
12/26/2008,i had a witty response. but how about abort!/me thumbs down.
12/26/2008,i don't like the idea of turning 0.0 into a player controlled high sec... the wild west really appeals to me and alot of players.i do think the security status system really needs to be reworked though.
12/26/2008,"for some a touchy subject but it's one that i have been mauling over for some time now.there are many factors in an eve corp, that can determine the overall success and failure's of that corp, same can be said for an alliance, however one of the principal factors is always isk, either from rating, pirating, espionage, marketing you name it isk is the principal on witch all else falls upon.in eve it's ok, allowed, encouraged, all of thee above however even in ebay i am able to look at the person selling or buying the merchandise and make a decision to do or not do business with that person.i know peps that say ""oh it don't matter to me enemies or not if i needed i buy it regardless"", i say that is true but i want the ability to make that choice, i want to know who it is that's selling that merchandise because the rest do not share that idea of just going blindly.it can just as easily be said, that buy not feeding my enemies my isk, i, my corp, my alliance stands a greater chance of defeating my enemies.this single change of including the information of who the sellers are could totally topple the spies, the thief's, the giants with monopolies in the industries, peps, corps, alliances would have to think a bit more carefully about their actions and the risk that might be associated with them as would any corporation in a free trade market.after all if every thing is possible in the corporate world in eve, then it should be a fair playing field, the same way protection is afforded to the pirate that ganks my ship, or the thief that steals from my corp, or the spy that infiltrates my alliance, then we should be afforded the same infinitesimal protection as well.i am petitioning the stellar council and ccp to incorporate such an update the ability to know who the person or corp, or alliance is that i may be considering to purchase from as well as the ability to create a ban list of the same information to have the ability prevent them from purchasing my goods as part of my own discretion, it's minor in the programing requirements, as well as a very needed tool even to the single solo player, we are entitled to know who we are doing business with before not after the sale is done.even if i am one of the player's in eve that simply does not care, i should still have the choice after all it is my business, my corp, my alliance and that choice to act on banning or not caring, that should be my choice and not forced."
12/26/2008,"sure.turning supercaps into stations is dumb as hell. at the end of the day they're still ships flown by pilots doing so to help their alliance. you don't want to be rewarding this by removing them from combat and turning the endgame of eve into logging in as a pos, to be shot and and defended by others.the doomsday needs to be replaced with something that ensures the titan is still deployed onto a battlefield and kept there for more time than it takes to align out, still has a unique and powerful role, but doesn't win a fight solo. making the doomsday scriptable would also add a new tactical dimension to a fight. it means titans are more flexible and would be used (and therefore destroyed) more often in combat.here are the ideas i like:aoe e-wara racial e-war effect that requires the titan to stick around to work. ideas that have already been mentioned include warp scrambling, mwd inhibition, webification, an ecm pulse and a neutralizing effect that removes a % of cap from every ship in range.weakened doomsdaylike a hybrid of current doomsdays and smartbombs. low damage pulses over a massive range designed to counter drones, fighters, frigates and finish off capsules. a real 'anti-blob' weapon that doesnt require a blob to counter it.focused blastthe doomsday acts as a special siege module, immobilising the titan for x amount of time but giving it a massive rof+damage modifier to its capital weapons. useful to turn the tide in capital battles and actually makes the racial titan weapon bonus useful.this script will require a cooldown before being used again.remote interferencesimilar to the siege module effect above, when this script is fired upon a target it does no damage, but prevents all remote assistance modules (armour, shield and energy transfers) being used on it for as long as the titan keeps the doomsday active. now the titan can be used to help kill other supercaps, but must be committed to a fight to do so.none of these scripts will wipe out an opposing fleet solo, and require the titan to be used alongside a support fleet to be effective."
12/26/2008,"personally i see ms as an super-carrier. ccp has talked about carriers being too good at being all-round ships, and i think the answer is to give motherships that role instead. these are all options to give motherships that edge:1) remove the carrier range bonus to capital remote transfers, and have it only apply in triage mode. motherships will keep the range bonus. this will result in carriers needing to commit to repping just like dreads commit to sieging, but motherships don't need to specialise.2) remove the drone bonus from carriers, but buff drone control units to replace it. each dcu would allow 2 additional drones for a maximum of 15, at the cost of sacrificing hi-slots. motherships would retain a 3 drone per level bonus and be unable to fit dcus - giving them up to 25 drones but all hi-slots to use.3) increase sma capacity to better support a fleet engaging in hostile space.4) add new 'logistics' fighters for motherships. these follow gang members in system to transfer armour, shield, cap or boost combat ability with sensor links / remote eccm / remote tracking links.5) local 'cynojammer' module that prevents cyno fields being created within 1000km of the mothership. intended to protect capital fleets from sudden counter attacks but means the mothership itself must be commited to the fight too.6) fix the projected ecm burst. currently the skill removes 1 second from the activation time per level, which is not only wrong according to the description but also useless. i would change projected electronic countermeasures to either a) add 10% range per level (150km > 225km), orb) remove 7.5% from the module cooldown per level (5mins > ~3mins)the clone vat bay needs to be properly implemented for motherships and titans. this should add the ability to a) allow gang members to remotely install empty jump clones from an alliance-owned station.b) allow gang members within 5km to upgrade/change location of their medical clone (although only to a station not the supercap).c) allow gang members to clone jump back to a station leaving an implanted clone inside the supercap. needing to destroy jumpclones to allow regular use of a clone vat is both extremely stupid and self-defeating.i would like to see a new hi-slot 'repair bay' module for motherships and titans. this is activated and uses fuel akin to a clone vat bay. once active, any gang member within 10km that is not locked by another ship will regenerate hull, armour, shield and cap over time.the idea of a push-jump drive intrigues me. it won't be implemented in that form because it allows people to get into dev regions and circumvent all gatecamps. perhaps it should work along the lines of a covert jump portal and only connect to covert cynos."
12/26/2008,you didn't read the minutes either i see. you didn't read any of the dev-blogs either
12/26/2008,"yep, i'm here only for trolling, off course!"
12/26/2008,"we indeed already discussed this with ccp and they just said we should wait for fanfest announcements. at fanfest they came up with those branching storyline missions.not exactly what we want though, as we asked for random, dynamic content, not a bulk more static content."
12/26/2008,in theory your proposal could result in a 36 frigate encounter in a level 4? /me imagines doing this in a bs./shudderi hope that if this gets accepted there will be some 'refinements' and limitations to the randomness.
12/26/2008,isnt that bad tbh. could be a fairly expensive lp book. only those already loyal to the faction then can sell it.i dont see why all the factions cant have this? including mordus; and such.furthermore it should be a strong enough force.if say you run missions for amarr. your standings with gallente will be -2.0 max. with current skills you can still run for them. minnie will be -5.0 max. you cant run with them unless u have diplo 5 which is annoying.now if you did a few missions against gallente or minnie because u didnt know better. i sure didnt know better until much later. doesnt hurt though.now you have others who do loads of these kill missions against gallente and get -8 or something standing. those people should be more or less irreversible; unless they find some other faction to fight for to recover standings.
12/26/2008,or you could pay attention to the mission you accept and not do the ones against a faction...
12/26/2008,"this is already on the list for things being discussed, read your email."
12/26/2008,how about a tractor beam ii along with salvager ii for starters?
12/26/2008,no need... these modules do exist in the database already.ccp basically just need to seed the blueprint and do the rest of the magic. even if just the medium tractor beam.
12/26/2008,bump
12/26/2008,"please stop bumping this thread, as it's against the forum rules. we already raised this issue. now let it die."
12/26/2008,"well i have only once misfiled a petition. it was kindof on purpose though :)i find it disturbing exploit petitions get responded to in about 5 days. while ""agent missions in progress"" are responded to within 10 minutes.i am lol.not really tbh. i can file lots in short time. i even add in pics.thing is...i had a graphic bug. i tested the bug...ubuntu:under wine with classic graphics. i had the bug.under wine with premium graphics. i had the bug.windoze:premium graphics. i had the bug.windoze#2 different comp-crappy gfx card:classic graphics. i had the bug.took absolutely no work to reproduce it each time.i make a bug report detailing these things.bh responds with... ""dxdiag please and logserver if you can""1st. i will never use logserver. wont happen. if you require logserver to get bug reports through bh. say now and i will discontinue reporting bugs but i retain my right to complain about bugs.2nd. 2 different computers, 1 computer is dual boot for different os. ubuntu doesnt even have dxdiag really. at least not a real one. so what is the point in asking for dxdiag? waste of my time.so i respond... i have the bug on different computers. it cant be my hardware at fault as there isnt a single thing related. one is intel-nvidia, main is amd x2-ati.2nd bh completely different guy. ""i cant seem to reproduce""ffs. they didnt even try apparently. so i simply reedit giving plenty of detail in the reproduction steps... to the point someone who has been playing the game for 12 minutes could follow thempetition filtered with no response.huh? what wait what? filtered iow trashed and in the garbage.if they want my help... and i give that much ... to that point...and it's still trashed... maaaan.oh how about that double memory leak... i reported that... got filtered with no response. so i made thread in the known issues area and explained that a memory leak expands until there's no memory left to suck and then crashes eve.bug reporting is very sad tbh.so when the pos exploiters claim they bug reported it and nothing happened... i know for a fact 101% this is a fact. the chance of them lying is far overshadowed by the bug reporting system monster.you report something and a bh reads the exploit. filters it saying it's nothing... and then uses it himself. no other bh then read it.what makes things worse... i applied to become bh; because of this pos exploit... i didnt even get an interview because i'm better fit in ""star"" like wtf... i dont want to be in star. unless there's some sort of benefit for me to do that... i wouldnt even do it. so basically they dont want me? seems odd.. perhaps i'm a newb who doesnt know better. i dunno.bug reports need to be public. easily stackable. perhaps something like a wiki? petitions can be made private by anyone quickly to hide exploits and such. this way bh who are incompetant can be easily identified. bug hunters can see the bugs people are having and test them on sisi. use the bug reporters as a filter for bugs... not these incompetant bh(exceptions obviously exist)</rant>"
12/26/2008,"obviously you've never been to the wow forums. it's the worst forum cesspool on the internet. easily worse than 4chan.recently blizzard has been doing what you're proposing and it's turning out to be a huge disaster (no surprise there really). the forum moderators are banning innocent people while the trolls continue to troll. either their aim is terrible, or their policies regarding trolling are backwards. i would support this if ccp forum policies were clear and enforced equally across all players. currently i just don't know."

12/26/2008,"for now i've given up on dual displays. at the time i was using winxp 64-bit (as i still am) and an nvidia card. i noticed that windows media player is about the only application known to be able to operate in full screen mode on one screen while the other display is used for different tasks (e.g. a fast web browser for viewing mission reports. i resorted to running the eve client in windowed mode but did not enjoy having to reposition the application window every time. now that ccp is all buddy buddy with ms, perhaps some programming tips can be gleaned. perhaps some tips from nvidia could be gleaned as well to get dual screens to work optimally. (but please don't get the client to proprietary with one graphics card manufacturer versus another.)for now i continue to use winxp 64-bit but have switched to dual ati 3870 cards in crossfire mode rather than risking silicon substrate failure on a new nvidia purchase."

12/27/2008,"people can already get around you keeping track of them by buying a new character, selling their character that damaged you, or by creating an alt on the same account.let people who've purchased a character, changed play styles, or decided they like this game after all change their name."
12/27/2008,"one of the issues i see with t2 ammo is that really considering the time you put in to train to use it the benefits really arent there, the dissadvantages far outway any advantage it may have. really makes training for t2 gear a dissadvantage, because its getting to the stage you could have trained 2 other skills in that time that would probably be more useful. cost for good ammo for pvp isnt really a consideration."
12/27/2008,i'd agree. most of the t2 ammo has disadvantages the outweight the advantages. i would use t2 crystals but faction crystals give me only a little less damage with no disadvantages at all.faction should not be better than t2 since it has the same skill requirement of t1. it should be better than t1 since it's only a meta level of the t1 variant but t2 should always out-perform it.
12/27/2008,"this makes sense both in terms of realism (which is secondary at best, but always nice to have) as well as respecting game mechanics such as security ratings."
12/27/2008,"seeing as i voted a proposal based on the same idea here 2 week ago, repeating the vote to add numbers seem a bit wrong to me."
12/27/2008,"true, to a degree... at the ""end-user"" level, his proposal seems to be somewhat similar.but he didn't exactly present it in a ""easily digestible"" format, and he's been posting semi-formed and not well though-out ideas by the truckload lately, so his threads do have a rather low visibility.also, he only seems to want a system where asteroids remain ""as is"", with easily visible ""what's actually inside"" features, requiring the creation of many more variations of ore types (17 additional, a total of 20 for each ore). heck, if anything, the proposal in this thread could work even if you remove all but the basic version, since extraction speed would depend on densities (which not only could they be set to just about any degree of finesse, but would actually vary in time if specialist crystals are being used).bottom line, this proposal is not the work of one person but of several, and it's been sitting around unused for a long time. just because he managed to post his less developed ideas first during this csm's term and you supported it first doesn't mean also supporting a slightly more developed proposal would be wrong, now would it ?if anything, he could just get the proposal here, merge it with his and see what comes out."
12/27/2008,"i agree that mining needs an overhaul. we're likely to discuss this in iceland as there is already a proposition on the table for discussion, but i think we should keep this as general as possible and not stick to one single solution. it's likely that ccp is already working on something, and it would be nice to have a general discussion about it."
12/27/2008,"ok, you have convinced me btw: about your last part, i think that a form of ""merge"" option for threads with very similar proposals or arguments would be a good thing for this forum. something like the op or a moderator put a by-directional link in the ""primary"" or ""more developed/more voted thread"" linking a ""secondary"" with the same discussion going and closing the secondary thread. that would limit a bit the clutter on this forum section. something in the form of ""thread closed, discussion continue on this thread (link)"" and ""link to the similar thread named xx (link)""that option should be limited only for threads in this forum section."
12/27/2008,"thank you for your persistence, white ronin. i was disappointed that your other thread got closed before i could show support. thanks also to ankhe for bringing it up with the csm and i'm fine with tusko's idea in regard to hardwiring which is what i was really looking for anyway.if not proposed already, i suggest the following two improvements: 1) that the drone skill be changed so that it pertains to the amount of drone bandwidth a player can use rather than the number of drones the player may control, and 2) that the drone window reveal drone health not just for those drones which are deployed but also for those drones still in the drone bay. the reason for item one is that i just got a ship that can hold 15 of my current level drones but i can only control 4. for item two... well, how many times has anyone here wanted to deploy a drone for the sake of repairing it without knowing which drone in the bay needed it? imagine if i have 15 drones in the bay, one of which needs repair, yet i can only deploy four at a time."

12/27/2008,i would be thrilled with just being able to put one skill in a queue to train once my current skill training completes.
12/27/2008,as would most of us. it's not like we're asking for a queue that lets us set skills for the coming year or something....
12/27/2008,"/signed.at least you can ensure that any emergency won't leave you losing training time.this is especially useful to new characters with very short skill times. how many people want to get up 3 hours after going to bed because that's the longest skill they can train. losing a couple of hours later on isn't so bad because the shortest skill could take days or even weeks. at the start it makes a lot of difference because two or three hours can mean two or three skill levels. to become competetive in this game, you need a lot of those basic rank 1 and 2 skills up as high as possible."
12/27/2008,"i also want a skill queue!maybe ccp employees never have to suffer sudden internet outages, but i certainly do. it's bad enough when my internet randomly goes down for 4 days, i'd like to not lose training at the same time."
12/27/2008,would be a good time to introduce this system.

12/27/2008,"provided it had a 24 or 48 time cut off, i'm down with this...infact, it's been the major barrier for me in developing an alt, so i could see this making more $$ for the ccp in the long run if my case wasn't unique."
12/27/2008,unique case ??i dont even want to know how many people dont bother with an alt because there is no sq....i would make another alt if there was a sq....edit: ah i see you are csm - go and put pressure onto ccp please - gogogogogo :)

12/27/2008,"to me their is no doubt that if the exploit actually took place to the extent as stated by one of the individuals involved that the market affect has been staggering.however in trying to think through this and although i signed earlier for transparency, we should honestly take a moment and think about a few things.if ccp knew about this exploit, from their prospective why announce it now and bring all this drama to their door step.if the (op in the link) stated all truths then by pure future alone every single recorded transaction from the recorded estimated time these moon facilities went on line by the exploiters every single isk handed out and or items purchased would have to be confiscated, this would include all isk that was given to other players in the course of the 4 years.the above as i have stated although would be only fair it would also mean the end of eve, because essentially all would have to start from scratch and i don't mean all involved i mean all players.saying that no you should only punish those directly involved will only stem the perpetrators it will not however stem the effect that the exploited isk has already done.revealing who these peps are or where and banning said people would lead to a total breakdown of the eve universe, lets face it if as stated earlier all things reported by the (op link) was true and there was a monopoly within the affects of a total cut off would bring the eve industrial economy to a grinding halt.it is the same like in the u.s. if the giants of the industries were to be closed down due to illegal activities, or a monopoly the effects would be felt world wide.so what could you actually do because it can not go simply unpunished nor can it be allowed to continue?the (op link) said that he estimates 4 trillion went into the coffers of his corps pockets and that 3 other alliances were involved on just a fair average that would be almost 16 trillion isk total.i propose this (i know this is going to sound crazy but hear me out)1. don't ban the people involved, name the alliances that were directly involved.2. fine each alliance 2 trillion isk. (each alliance would be given a reasonable time frame to pay these fines, failure or refusal of the alliance to pay said fine would result in a per-ma band of the alliance and the inability of said corps in the alliance of being able to rejoin another alliance under their current corp name and would also result in immediate confiscation of all assets owned by the alliance even if the assets were transferred to others)ie: alliance (we rule) has 4 corps a, b, c, d they refuse to repay the fine, when the fine was first levied all assets were recorded and logged these assets such as towers, operational equipment etc can not be transferred and would be confiscated by ccp, corp a,b,c,d under the (we rule) alliance would be disbanded and corps a,b,c,d can never rejoin nor start another alliance again.3. 7 day loss of all sovereignty to said alliances.4. these moon-es in question that would have produced these conglomerate resources remove their setting from current locations and re-stage them in totally different system unknown to any one so that the moon is still there but no longer able to produce said resource.if these alliance where to comply with this, these alliance's would still be able to operate, they would still be able to function although severely hampered for they would no longer have the constant cash cow used in the monopoly exploit, the financial burden in of it self is staggering to any alliance and a fair playing field is levied with removal of sovereignty from each alliance for 7 days giving what would be other alliances or corps the opportunity for retaliation.this would also however bring a temporary slow down in ship production but not a grinding halt, it would stage a level playing field as this monopoly would have created in it's 4 year total in-balance"

12/27/2008,yes pls ad one of your superservers to the fw systems
12/27/2008,i'm in.
12/27/2008,can we have a neutral thumb as well to express neutrality so it will not be confused with any discussion going on in the thread?
12/27/2008,"while i like the idea, it would seem this is more a step in removing/replacing pos's. now i'm in favor of simplifying those and possibly using this as a replacement for pos's with sixe category setups to follow those lines. i would say existing pos's simply get a remodel free for those that have them if this method were to be used.now you can correct me if i'm wrong in this assumption, but other then that it would seem that all you're doing, if not making a pos replacement, if setting up waypoints to warp from a battle as a safe spot. really not worth it if that is all it is. i can do that with a bookmarked can.i would say more definition of the goal or design is needed, but for now i support this."
12/27/2008,"well, this has some specific nice parts to it. for one, it is far weaker than a pos, as the ship gives the armor/shield/hull values rather than the pos itself, and it is only one target rather than the myriad that comes with poses.second, this area allows you to refit ships and produce ammunition only. the cryotank idea is debatable, and could be removed without any shedding of tears. a pos has full manufacturing modules, moon mining capabilities, faster ore refining, etc.i don't see this as any attempt to override the standard pos, and think it will only make them more important in the game, as they're a lot stronger and more versatile than this 'home away from home'."
12/27/2008,well it would sure help now that the spos has died from the discussions and disappeared from the drawing board list

12/27/2008,"anyone else here think its about time ccp boosted the corp hanger capacity of carriers? since the removal of carriers ability to carry industrials with cargo a while back theres still a lot of small corps in eve that rely on carriers for the low sec logistics work, due to there cheapness to deploy compared to other ships such as a capital industrial and considerably cheaper compared to a jump freighter.an increase of maybe 15k or 20k m3 to the corp hanger would make them slightly more viable for small corps in the current eve environment, while not making them super haulers with teeth.anyone else agree/disagree with this? discuss"
12/27/2008,"i fly around thanatos and i really do find it lacking in space. if you havent gotten to the skills allowing extended ranged jumpdrives. oftentimes you basically need your entire corp hangar just for fuel to get back from where you are going. you cant bring anything with you. unless it's a ""charge"" obviously.having said that...i would rather there be a skill introduced which boosts the size of corp hanger-ship main size say 5% per level or something rather then have just a plain boost that everyone gets."

12/27/2008,"made me giggle, but other than that i am voting against this. i think cloaking goes far enough."
12/27/2008,"it is a good example of a q-ship for eve. the use of a similar ship will change a bit the balance of low sec mining and give a possibility for pirate hunting. the hauler in the midst of a group of barges can be a real hauler or can be a black op ship. people using it that way are risking a t2 ship worth several hundred millions and with a fairly limited combat capability to get a chance of killing some raider. they would be taking a fairly serious risk to bite too much for the chance of some kills. don't seem particularly unbalanced. so where you see the ""questionable "" part in this mechanic?btw:any battleship can cloak."
12/27/2008,agreed
12/27/2008,"a little note saying why, and perhaps a direct link to the rules, would help a lot. having people scared to post things because they might possibly maybe get their thread locked depending on the phase of the moon and if the number of the day is or isn't in some way related to 42 makes for a bad atmosphere"
12/27/2008,"pure and simple: i would like to add t2 salvager modules to the game. leaving out the details (faster salvage cycles, greater range, etc.) i think that this will greatly assist the salvaging profession."

12/27/2008,"an excellent suggestion. t2 salvagers and tractor beams would be very nice. a ship dedicated to salvaging, hacking, archaeology and etc. would also be a nice addition."
12/27/2008,"/signed.give it a slight % bonus over the standard salvager rather than more range. 3 t1 rigs and skill level 5 with a salvager only = 60% and still only 75% with t2 rigst2 tractor beams would be good too, more range (possibly 30k) and speed 750m/s. which would then be increased by the marauder bonus to 60km/1.5km/s and orca bonus to 90km/1.5km. not really needed for the rorqual since they can use capital tractor anyway."
12/27/2008,so am i too late to support this ?
12/27/2008,i would drag random people around for hours while going afk
12/27/2008,"this would definetly be interesting if such a module was to be implemented into combat - however a massive nerf to ship abilities would have to be applied, along with a heafty capacitor cost once active to prevent exploit - like :speed decrease : - 100%agility decrease : - 100%signature radius : + 100%perhaps also scripted for ""push"" and ""pull"""
12/27/2008,that would be fun stuff.... but could lead to some issues.i'll wait for a bit first.
12/27/2008,"perhaps this would be a great way for dedicated salvage ships to combat the ninja salvager threat. call it balancing if you will.while we're at it, how about letting me stab them in the eye with my salvager module also?"
12/27/2008,i'd prefer planting booby-traps that would cause the wrecks to blow up in there faces.: o )
12/27/2008,"lol. i doubt they're going to allow tractoring without the aggro mechanic being applied, so i welcome this change. sure, let the mission runners tractor my ship away from their wrecks. while you're at it, give my alliance aggro over them, so that we can all jump in and blow up the offending ships.i think this is a great idea - as long as it's implemented fairly. i'd love to plant booby-traps in a wreck field to blow up a mission runner when he returns to pick up what he left."
12/27/2008,"i'd sign it if this also allowed ships to use tractor beams to pull themselves toward gates faster if they suddenly find themselves in a gate camp, especially since there are a lot of login traps at gates now. gates are anchored and can't move threfore the tractor would have the effect of pulling the ship to the gate."
12/27/2008,/me petitions ccp for the fact that the op is spamming.

12/27/2008,"ice belts have been pretty much abused by both farmers and macroers, since it's easier to mine ice than roids.why, you ask?because after you target one of the gigantic ice cubes out in any icebelt, no matter how many ice harvester you put on it, it won't ever despawn.that's pretty absurd.as roids have a fixed amount of ores in each belt (respawns regularly two days a week), so should ice belt. maybe with an higher respawn rate, like 3-4 days a week, but hell, make it despawn.it has been abused (and is still abused) by most macros.if you don't like this applied to all ice belts, just do it in emprie ones, so that 0.0 alliances can have their near infinite fuel supply near their house, and high sec ice price skyrocket.any argumented suggestion will be discussed, any troll will be flamed, any csm constructive input will be taken into account."
12/27/2008,nosense support reply<----
12/27/2008,"while this idea might do a little to combat the massive problem, i don't agree with it. those who do mine ice would be severely hindered by it (mine 4 units, move to next cube, etc), and macroers wouldn't be phased (the programs must have redirect settings to mine so much veld/etc).as with my other posts, mining in general needs a massive reworking that i agree with, but i don't see this as being the right way to go. from the graphics video from fanfest 2008, i noticed they were planning to implement asteroids similar to the rings of saturn or the star wars video where they're escaping from tie fighters.hopefully, the next patch will include some of this, as it is exploration-based, and they really need to throw us a bone after the last expansion (quantum rise) was a critical failure on the industrial patch, focusing more on lag reduction and eye candy."
12/27/2008,"will the ""mining"" as a whole be fixed, or only ore mining?cmon, it's not 4-5 units cube, be it 100-200 each, but give it a limit, so you'll either see less ice on the market or more macroes in ls/0.0"
12/27/2008,with the long cycle times and utterly predictable roids it's like they designed ice mining with macros in mind. not sure how to fix that or macro mining in general though.
12/27/2008,i don't always like to block folks. how about a means of clearing the local chat window in the client by a means other than logging off and back on?i support the discussion continuing but perhaps not the exact idea.
12/27/2008,a bit of smack can be fun and sometimes it's hilarious to read i'm not sure why you want to put a damper on it.
12/27/2008,now that i'd like.

12/27/2008,"but then your alt or corpie can be seen in local. if there is an alt or corpie then that person know something it there, they don't know how many are there but they know that someone is there"
12/27/2008,"epegi givo where have you been hiding? this idea was brought up at the csm meeting in iceland during the first term.it was rejected by the members and that's the end of it. there is no resurrecting a rejected topic.also it is a terrible idea. there are too many people permanently hiding in empire space as it is. nerfing local would only cause mass migration from 0.0 to empire.ps i am not at all surprised that ""remove local"" activists have resorted to spamming."
12/27/2008,anything that makes poses better.if at least they'd show which modules are active or not.
12/27/2008,"okay, so far i see we are in a concensus that most people tend to use destroyers as salvagers. most people also want adjustments made to a proposed t2 destroyer for salvage only purposes. here's what i think, if you plan to make a salvage specific ship it should be similar to industrial ships in that they are not designed for combat. getting hit in a industrial ship is close to death, as a non-combat ship this should also be true. i should point out that i do agree that it should be a fast, manuvuerable ship. adds to the salvage element that most people use.here's the big point i would deviate from. the big reason people use destroyers is for the high slot turret ratios. i would say that the ship design should remain a high slot ship, but alter the setup for tractor beams and salvagers so that they use the high slots but not as turrets placements. this means the new ship should have alot of high slots but few to no turret placements. this would effectively make it non-combat, like and industrial ship. from there you could have a larger cargo bay and increased tractor range. i understand this would be some significant changes to the game structure for mods and ships, but if you want a dedicated ship like this you have to balance it to the game. just an idea of mine; feel free to agree or disagree with it."
12/27/2008,"so you want to further nerf pirates and pvp by adding excessive and unnecessary penalties.no, the system is fine as is."
12/27/2008,terrible. your idea only encourages people to go pirate full time or to log off for a week at a time. system is fine as is.
12/27/2008,"flashy red, yes. so anybody can try to shoot them without sec penalties.concord or faction navies, no. leave it up for the players. only if sec status gets too low should navies get involved.and if they initiate the assault, concord, of course."
12/27/2008,its fine for me.always up while i'm awake.and on saturdays and sundays its placed right at the time i'm have a nice big greasy fry-up breakfast anyway.no to change!
12/27/2008,"server downtime is roughly in the middle of the workday at the locations where the server and ccp are.you really wouldn't want a downtime as the first thing in their workday while they're all still drowsy, and you certainly wouldn't want it when most of the people that can help if anything goes wrong want to go home.so, basically, no. dt is when it is for a reason, and it's then for ccp's convenience.moving it to please some specific customers would make no sense, since it would just clash with other customer's timetable, and making it a ""hovering"" downtime is bad for other reasons.bottom line, thumbs down."
12/27/2008,better documentation at start would be more helpful. this isn't appropriate.
12/27/2008,i say that eve should suggest a good general purpose attribute layout at the start for players to pick.
12/27/2008,"sorry. i couldn't sleep. -was having a nightmare about someone salvaging my wrecks.neither of the op's options fits me perfectly.i think it would be more appropriate for you to obtain my agent's opinion on this.i suspect the pod pilot will wish to inform the agent who will, in turn, contact concord regarding interference with a contracted pod pilot. concord will then take a knock off of the ninja's security status and broadcast a constellation wide message such as, ""14:03:55 notify all ninja salvagers in the such&such empire will be shot on sight! interferring with concord sactioned peace keeping duties will be your last mistake, dedalus77!""if the pod pilot is working on a non concord sanctioned mission and get's ninja'ed, then the agent may wish to think twice before contacting concord. if concord finds that the agent is issuing contracts for illegal work then the agent will take a security status / agent quality hit. if the agent continues long enough with assigning illegal missions, then the agent will be forced to relocate to systems of a lesser and lesser security status -systems traditionally not considered to be mission hubs.this solution provides a way for the gods to influence the feeble-minded for the sake of clearing out laggy systems. that is by tempting lazy pod pilots who are incapable of completing their own high level missions and by having agents in such systems assign more frequent illegal missions. of course the agents will claim, at the tribunal, that ""the devil made me do it.""give agents a break. they have much at stake seeing that their contracts are assigned and completed. if you mess with the contractor, you mess with the contractee and you will face the consequences."
12/27/2008,"personally i'd prefer a 100% stat boost instead of a flat 10 points. this would make the starting attributes more significant. because right now they are pretty much irrelevant apart from the extreme min-maxing crowd, considering the 3-10 start gets drowned out by a 15 flat boost from skills/implants."
12/27/2008,"learnings are not specialization, they are skills everyone does with no real gain at all.get them out of game, they're fricking horrible. set their rank to 0, set their skill level to 5, and hide the whole skillgroup out of everyones character sheet.they probably put off more players from eve than any other ""feature""."
12/27/2008,that's eve-o for you.
12/28/2008,"read more. this thread has nothing to do about ninja salvaging. (didn't i just say this?)if you want to debate it further, please do it in this thread. yes, i realize you've already posted there. shame on you for cross-posting your opinions in the pitboss' thread.(you're wrong, by the way. your salvage, and the salvage of all mission runners belongs to me.)"
12/28/2008,"i hope that council members are taking note of this discussion, i can tell you from personal experience in crafting professions, games such as swg one of the capital mistakes that where made in a crafting system that was hailed as the best and most intricate crafting system ever created.they nerfed a lot of player created combat items in an attempt to provide better balance, however when the calls came out about other avenues of the game such as crappy lewt drops, they started creating and spawning lewt/npc drops/equipment etc, etc that was better than what could be created.my self like many others screamed at the top of our lungs that this is a dangerous direction it will hurt if not destroy the crafting professions.ask any one that played swg in a crafting profession it totally destroyed the profession. now in eve it is called manufacturing and fortunately their is a substantial amount of choices available to arm your defences, but heed the warning lewt/drops from npc (anything) that are better, cheaper, etc than manufactured items should be like 1 out of a million chances to get, if and when they became a regular item drop (as they now are)and their worth and abilities become better or greater than crafted/manufactured items(and they are), that's the end of that series of craft-able items. (production runs grinding to a halt).do not go down this avenue!so how do you fix this well the faction ammo is already present leave it alone! fix the damn t2 ammo.there should be a reason why peps should pay more (because t2 is better ammo)so were does that leave faction ammo, (not quite as good, and a little cheaper) so that faction ammo is still available and a viable commodity to those that may not be able to afford the best.and the t2 ammo once again has an actual reason to even exist, other wise if your not going to fix t2 ammo, i would say to you unlike what a lot of peps here have said don't kill the t2 ammo that is player a created commodity, get rid of the npc uber dropped faction ammo all together.lewt drop only affects the pocket of the person selling the commodity, player manufactured item affects the pockets from the manufacturer, to the developer of the bpo, all the way back to the miner, the choice is pretty simple."
12/28/2008,"i am not a producer, but a user. i do think that faction navy ammo is too cheap. it makes regular t1 ammo completely worthless (for anyone but poor noobs)the cost of buying faction ammo from agent should be increased 3xi don't support any other changes, other than price adjustment"
12/28/2008,id just be happy if ccp even came to support 2 full screen instances of eve on 2 monitors using 1 video card with dual outs. i seriously hate having to run in windowed mode when i want to run both monitors.
12/28/2008,"really nice idea, i can imagine that this might be able to bring a lot of new energy into 0.0-warfare."
12/28/2008,"good stuff. not sure i like high ends being available in high sec, it should be difficult to get the high ends in high sec, not impossible but difficult and not very profitable.having the ore scanner give out new results to mine makes it a bit less boring. being able to choose what minerals i am getting is sweet.there needs to be some more competition though, how about a nice bonus for finishing off each asteroid? that way people can try to snipe rocks that are almost out and compete with others to finish off rocks to get more ore.good start. thumbs up."
12/28/2008,"well, considering you can get up to 366 units of arkonor per cycle in a hulk at max skills with the proper implants right now, getting a maximum of 3 per cycle (at densities 100 times smaller than those in deep 0.0) under the same circumstances in a 1.0 system would probably satisfy the requirement of ""non-profitability"""

12/28/2008,"this post is essentially extracted from our conversations in iceland regarding 0.0. i'm not going to get too into detail regarding mechanics as that's really the dev's jobs, but i think we can all agree that 0.0 needs some love and it needs it now. there's a few pieces to this proposal and i'll update it as necessary with any good ideas. i'm in a bit of a rush as today's the deadline to get topics posted for iceland so i'll be editing this with things i think of or your non terrible ideas as we progress. in simple bullet form:ccp has expressed a desire, and i agree kinda, to move away from pos's as the sov claiming mechanic. i don't believe a good replacement has been conceived. in the interim what could go a long way is reducing the quantity required to hold sov. my favorite proposal was made at the 0.0 roundtable in iceland. this would have sovreignty claims moved from moons to planets, with industrial pos aspects moved to moons and decoupled from sov. this would serve to reduce the number of posses required to claim and give smaller groups a target to hit to disrupt industrial operations alone. industrial structures should be easier to attack and should not require the large amount of people a sov pos requires to engage. this will also serve to address the problem of people ""claiming more space than they can defend"".right now as it stands the risk versus reward equation is completely skewed in eve. 0.0 is completely stagnant and the reason for this is that conquering space is simply not worth it. there's no ""massive riches"" to be gained. in truth with the way truesec works npc 0.0 is actually far more profitable. what i'd recommend is not to reduce the value of npc and empire/lowsec space but to buff 0.0. there are a number of ways to accomplish this, one that i've proposed involves giving spaceholding alliances the ability to upgrade their space over time, increasing the sec rating or seeding asteroids or even a mechanic to add agents, perhaps via station upgrades. the possibilities for this are endless but at the end of the day the big picture desired end result is to make conquering space worth it. you should not be able to get richer in eve doing less work.these are the big two and i realize they're very high level. i'll post more/refine as things are added to this thread. that is what this forum is for."
12/28/2008,"this is something which is discussed in csm for quite some time. it is not a simple issue so we will give our best to present this during our meeting in iceland. this is some of my ideas based on draft darius made for current 0.0 situationsov mechanicsall moon structures (current poses) would lose their ability to count for sovereignity. sov holding structures would be moved to planets. poses will remain as they are currently but they will lose all structures connected to sovereignty as:- cynosural generator array- cynosural system jammer- jump bridge- system scannin arrayplanet orbiting structures should have much more hp then current poses and they should have ability to anchor and online following modules:- turret batteries- electronic warfare batteries- energy neutralizing batteries- missile batteries- shield hardening arrays- corporate hangar arrayas well as modules connected to sovereignty mentioned above. precise amount of hp (shield, armor and structure) as well as pg/cpu should be carefully increased, but with current number of capital ship ingame it needs to be a bit more then current control towers. that will significantly decrease amount of poses we have atm and it would limit sov holding structures strictly to the planets. planetsi would refer to the issue already raised by csm"

12/28/2008,"summary of what i understand of the problems in 0.0, overlaps a lot of the things darius and vuk already stated in their posts though!boring pos warfare* currently the only way to conquer space is through the destruction of the poses in the system.* pos warfare is repetetive.* no direct reward for those participating in pos warfare.solutions* detach sov from pos.* different objectives for different types/sizes of gangs.* more stuff to destroy and plunder for instant loot!useless 0.0 space* many systems that lack valuable rats, ore and moon materials.* sov holders have much space they have no use for, but have to occupy for tactical reasons.* no way to improve or develop space over time.solutions* ways to discover new belts.* dynamic rat spawns, based on player actions.* prospecting for more/better materials at moons (uncovered veins get lower yield over time?)* construction of pos/outpost modules or small anchorables that bestow benefits upon the system.* pos or small anchorables that produce consumer goods, etc.lack of income sources for individuals 0.0* individuals can only gain income through mining, ratting and exploration.* complaint about missioning being exclusive to empire/faction space.* income sources are controlled by system, not players.solutions* npc factions respond to player action and establish themselves in alliance territory (or not), eventually handing out missions.* implement a player driven economy of trade goods (produced at small anchorables, consumed by outposts/stations).* add new professions and activities.lack of quick small gang pvp, lack of objectives* firepower is more important than mobility.* blobbing.* difficult if not impossible to take on capital ships without bringing your own.* small gangs cannot inflict damage or influence sov.* supply lines are not very exposed due to jumpbridges, etc.solutions* more objectives besides pos warfare.* add small anchorables to destroy and loot.* add game mechanics that favor quick hit-and-run tactics.* make it beneficial for small gangs to roam and patrol own space.pos fuelling is tedious* ice mining process is extremely boring.* distributing materials is repetetive.* trade goods cannot be produced in the general area.* administrative nightmare for large alliances.solutions* detach sov from pos so that less pos are required.* ? open to suggestions"

12/28/2008,in all actuality there needs to be two kinds of towers.---industrial poss that are able to moon mine and performing industrial activities. these towers would be unable to contribute to sovereignty.---the second sovereignty towers. poss that cannot moon mine or perform industry. however they do contribute to sovereignty.only sovereignty poss can anchor cyno jammers and cyno generators.this will mean that less tower destruction is required in order to take a system and that alliances are going to have to choose a balance between economics and defence.finally the cyno jammer must stay whatever the solution. otherwise return to the death of small gang warfare because everybody is afraid of a carrier being hot dropped.
12/28/2008,wholeheartedly supporting this. removing moons as a means of sov contesting largely reduces the threshold for people to enter 0.0. though i'd think that small and med pos would have to suffer an hp nerf so that people couldn't get 'raiding points' so easily.
12/28/2008,i support this
12/28/2008,"agreeing with the idea of moving sov poss to planetsmakes sov war simpler (fewer towers to consider) without completely destroying the pos infrastructure in place.but going down that road, would we need restrictions on numbers of poss on planets?"
12/28/2008,"vuk, get back in my bed.changes like this will mean a lot more small gangs going around and pew pewing in alliance 0.0 warfare."
12/28/2008,"if you have ideas, criticism or suggestions, do post them! if its any good we can add it to the final document. this is democracy as it's supposed to be, we listen to you."
12/28/2008,"i'm concerned moving sov claiming to planets only would return us to 2005/2006 days when alliances' soverign space was tiny. the current situation with >50% 0.0 systems held makes for a colorful map and accurate reflection of who controls what space. it feels like we've built empires.i'd suggest introducing an xl control tower, for planets, which would override large towers (at moons) just as large overrides medium etc.. moon starbases would still be able to claim sov level 1 but xl planet towers would be needed for sov 2,3,4 and would of course be the weapon of choice for sov warfare just as large are now. sov 1 should still get the associated fuel bonus because it's industrial related and some incentive to claim is needed (or rather a penalty for hiding your starbase is needed) but perhaps remove the notification of new towers being anchored as that's a strategic/space control advantage."
12/28/2008,never before have i felt a vote to be as inconsequential as this one.
12/28/2008,"supporting this. it is crucial for the endgame to be a desirable target to work toward for an mmo to have the best chance possible of retaining its membership's interest. 0.0 space is a huge part of that endgame for eve, and right now it is severely lacking in several regards brought up in the original few posts.i know personally that the addition of tactical goals able to be achieved by smaller roaming games would literally turn the game around for me and be the best possible addition to eve in my eyes. please ccp, make this a priority."
12/28/2008,great ideas here. pos shooting and pos upkeep are by far the most boring aspect of eve imo.one thing i'd like to see if the ideas of system upgrades are implemented is some kind of degradation over time aspect to remove the possibility of most systems simply being fully upgraded. there needs to always be the possibly for forward motion. statis = boring!
12/28/2008,nice stuff & many great ideas - i'm supporting this. time to change 0.0-warfare againg to bring new energy into it and make it more attractive.

12/28/2008,"risk vs reward ratio in 0.0 is terrible. i agree with the above suggestions and i think you should have gold rush situations where a npc corp 'strikes gold' and there is temporarily more of a certain type of resource in one particular (pref remote) area. this could be announced as a news item which would drive the rush aspect as people race to this area to claim some space gold. this will lead to pvp as well as industrial activities.being able to disrupt and loot hostile industrial operations with a small to medium gang is a great idea, and will reduce the situation where you cannot disrupt the enemies without a massive bs blob.planets should have populations and you should be able to seige them aswell as the space base orbiting it to screw with the resources that that planet produces. space base holds the sov though, not the planet.remove the current function of the local chat channel. make constellation chat auto update rather than local. interdictor bubbles should pull ships out of warp regardless of when they initialized it. if a ships warp path passes through a interdictors bubble, this should instantly pull them out of warp."

12/28/2008,"i believe that these are some good starting points for 0.0, but what about lawless space in general?i think there needs to be a big push for people to get out of empire. something big needs to change, something to attract people out of empire instead of continually grinding in high sec (granted you grind in low sec/0.0 too), but at least make the reward a lot more promising. as it stands now it seems like the pirates in low sec and the current corps/alliances/players in 0.0 need more competition/population. i honestly wish there were more people out here. it's ****ing empty!to be completely honest, there is no good reason to go into 0.1 to 0.4 systems unless you are doing a couple things:-traveling to 0.0-thinking pirating is a lucrative career-thinking low sec missions are really worth itthere is less of a risk being caught in 0.0 in alot of these regions, it's easier to hide a lot of times, and there aren't as many pirate corporations traveling through it. i really wish that there was a greater reward for a single player, or a small corporation to get out into 0.0 or low sec and risk some assets, but if they are smart they can gain a lot more. as it stands now i honestly see no reason to go into low sec/0.0 for any other reason beyond playing the giant conquering chess game. we need some better content out here. the giant alliances (me being in one of them) that hold 0.0 get boring, i really want to see more small guys out here, and i want them to have as much of an advantage as i have for the reward.in short, do not just buff 0.0, buff low sec as well make the reward much better to attract people out of empire.keep brainstorming/working"

12/28/2008,"reported for spamming.other thoughts i've seen on this:- stacking penalty to reinforced timers, i.e. 25% penalty to the reinforced timer every time it's reinforced, which goes down by 25% if it stays above 50% shields for 24 hours. 4 straight reinforces with no let-up = time to watch the tower burn.weakening the defensibility of cyno jammers:- major increase in the fitting requirements for cyno jammers so they can't be mounted on deathstars.- cyno jammer up = jump bridge and cyno beacon go offline.- doomsdays --> single-target instagib cannon.- deterioration of sov 3 if neighboring systems are taken.moon mining needs an overhaul as well, alchemy does not solve the fact that t2 components are bound to a finite supply of material, and does not scale well at all with player count the way almost every other form of income/material generation does which makes it useless as a personal income incentive."
12/28/2008,"glad to see this topic being raised.but i would really love to see a way that makes it harder to hold a large number of regions for a single alliance.as it is now its to hard for small alliances to claim 0,0 space, so whatever work that gets done to 0,0 i hope will be made to help smaller alliances as well.imo ccp should have removed moon mining and all forms of static income from 0,0 as thats the main reason alliances claim as much space as they do.an alliances income should come from taxes, not moon mining"

12/28/2008,"summarythough it would increase the complexity of the game,a modular colony system could do quite a few things to the game world:it can be a mechanism that allows more 0.0 independence from empire, requiring fewer commodities to be shipped in.it can generate revenue for an alliance, if they choose to do so.it can become a different focus for soverignty by making an area's population and its loyalty the determining factor for sov levels instead of who can build the most deathstar poss. the focus of poss would then return to moon mining, manufacture, research, etcit would add new blueprints for structures to be manufactured.it would increase the importance of different npc goods, while not entirely eliminating the importance of the current ones that are needed for player consumption.this system would give players a lot of flexibility in how they wanted to run their colonies. here are a few options1) combined mining/pos fuels colony with full luxury supply pros: higher profitability (approx 500mil isk/month) mining can offset more of the minerals needed for pos fuel manufacture cons: large runs of npc luxury goods required2) combined mining/pos fuels colony with no luxury supply pros: much reduced npc goods needed to support colony mining can offset more of the minerals needed for pos fuel manufacture cons: reduced profitability (approx 135mil isk/month)3) full pos fuels colony with no luxury supply pros: can support 20 poss with npc fuels much reduced npc goods needed to support colony cons: high costs for operation, will cost much more to make pos fuels in this manner (approx -520mil/month vs buying and hauling)4) full pos fuels colony with luxury supply pros: can support 20 poss with npc fuels while still not profitable, will have significantly lower operating costs (approx -159mil/month vs buying and hauling) cons: large runs of npc luxury goods required (most likely just easier to bring in the npc fuels instead)5) mining colony with no luxury supply pros: much reduced npc goods needed to support colony smaller manning requirements reduces costs lower initial costs better profitability by not supporting pos stations (approx 350mil/month) cons: no pos support generated less profitability based on higher wages for workers6) mining colony with luxury supply pros: high profit colony (approx 570mil/month) lower manning requirements lower initial costs better profitiability by not supporting pos stations cons: large runs of npc luxury goods requiredthis concludes the wall o' text please let me know what you think!"
12/28/2008,as ankhesentapemkah already mentioned something similar is already raised and it will be discussed. what we want to add to this is that planet structures (atleast some of them) could be lootable by incapping them. it will give one a goal to small roaming gangs which at this moment cant do much harm to big alliance except ganking their farmers who dont watch local nor read intel channels. i hope we will have more info about this soon.
12/28/2008,"such as the planetary warehouse i have in the list? i was thinking about that as well. there should probably be limits to how much of a planet's resources could be taken, though. also, if this were to come into play, the initial costs for the structures should be lowered. as is, a full large colony can cost up to 20bil to assemble, with at best a 10% monthly roi. also, if planetary colonies can be raided, i would suggest that pos silos and hangars should be raidable as well."

12/28/2008,"i'll try again. i'll go slow, very slow. maybe read my post a few times.miners are not supposed to jet can mine. if you know that jetcans are not intended for mining then why do you want a secure can almost the size of a jet can to mine? secure cans are big enough. they allow for small mining operations to keep their ore safe and if you use a gscs with some thought and a hauler you can easily avoid ore thieves.you want secure jetcan mining. i like how you are trying to deny it but you ***clearly*** say in your first post that you want secure jet can mining. don't lie to the player base, it is very unbecoming of a csm member. i don't see how your game-breaking ""idea"" makes miners more active. how is a secure jetcan not an iwin button for miners? have you put any thought into your ""ideas""?no, no no no no no no a thousand times no. if you want to use a gsc and a hauler to securely mine, congratulations. if you want to fit expanders and fill up your cargohold and then dock, congratulations. if you want easy mode mining into a secure jetcan then gtfo."
12/28/2008,"while i can appreciate the effect of this idea, which is a buff to mining, something that repels players new and old to be turned into something a little nicer, it's not the right way to go through with it at all. as others have stated, all you'd be doing is letting miners jet-can mine safely, which is a silly idea. you saying it's not like a jetcan won't work because a jetcan is free, your idea is 5000isk (almost free). it still has a massive cargo bay and is easily deployable. how about a can that has that size of a cargo and all that good stuff, but costs a lot of money to produce. would mean the miner has to invest in something that would boost his hourly isk income. there would still be a danger of people shooting the can, but this can be solved by giving it concord/militia aggro, meaning that you're likely to die after you've destroyed the can, without getting insurance. would give a nice risk to it, but not something you'd see everyone doing.just throwing out ideas."
12/28/2008,"x2, stop posting bunyip."
12/28/2008,"no, but if you created a container such as this which had different rules attached to it, you might get more support.for example - you deploy a special ""mining can"" which is, as you mention, very low in armor/structure. make it longer (as opposed to your idea) to deploy, lasting a significantly shorter time (i.e. usable for 1 hour, max), and sure, give it a password. however, and here's my contribution, make it so that if someone shoots the can, they can get aggro from the mr, but would not be concorded for the offense.now, you have a can with greater capacity (a boon for mr's!) and the balance of non-concord intervention for the griefers. from the rp side, it could be understood that ""mining cans"" just don't show up on concord's scanners, and thus, they don't know when they're being shot.i might (might) support something like this, but certainly not the idea you're proposing here."

12/28/2008,"the most reasonable change to tractor beams, without opening a can of worms, is by adding a small: 10-20% web effect."
12/28/2008,"yes! i've been trying to get this implemented for the last two years...here's the thing, though. tractor beams should be fundamentally different from webs. also, there would need to be different tiers of them; a small tractor beam shouldn't be able to pull a bs. so, in a nutshell, here's what we'd be looking at:tractor beams in general, if activated on a targeted ship, would add a speed vector to that ship in the direction of the ship with the tractor beam. it wouldn't slow down a ship at all (unless the target were moving away from the ship with the tractor beam), but it would make, say, an orbiting inty pilot have to adapt his orbit path in order to keep his proper range, which would end up slowing the overall orbit. there should be another tier of tractor beams added: large tractor beams. larges whould be capable of pulling frigates while capital tractors (already in game) should be able to pull cruisers and smaller. bs should not be able to be pulled, as this could lead to some incredibly unfair 0.0 fights with carriers pulling snipe bss out of formation. in any case, the speed vector added should have a magnitude of between 300-500 m/s. alternatively, the magnitude of the beam could be based on mass. that way, a large tractor could pull a frigate at 400m/s, a destroyer at 200m/s, a cruiser at 100m/s, a bc at 50m/s, etc. tractor beams capble of pulling ships would add so much flavor to combat while not being terribly overpowered. yes, you could encounter problems with a heavy tackler bs with 4 large tractors, 3 webs, 2 scrams and a couple neuts, but then again, if you're going to devote that many slots to tackling, shouldn't you be really, really good at it?anyway, this has my support. and yes, this would be similar to webbing someone as far as aggression is concerned, so miners, don't throw a fit just yet."
12/28/2008,"best sign it then. further up i suggested it not give you aggression if you targeted a gate or a station.. the fun thing here would be an inty throwing a beam on a gate and hitting full speed. not having to worry about orbit as the tractor handles that bit. then, when your target comes through, throw a tractor beam on him and off you go, orbiting him.. a bit like spiderman in space ;) to the other points about the tractor effects. newton's third law should apply here."
12/28/2008,"in eve there are several items that share identical stats, but have different names. i would like to see items with different names but identical stats merged into the same item, to fix the following issues:1 - increased database load to find these items on contracts at decent prices:lets take the following items as an example:amarr navy large armor repairerammatar navy large armor repairerdark blood large armor repairerkhanid large armor repairertrue sansha large armor repairerall of these have identical stats, so when i want one the others will do just as well. so instead of just one contracts search, i do 5 to find the cheapest price. then a sixth to buy it, unless the 5th search had the lowest price. if there are more than a page worth of results in total, this means that i have more results returned than i would if i only had to do one search. if each result returns more than a page worth of contracts, i'm talking approximately 6 times the number of results than i would get if they were all found with the one search.even if there is less than a page of results in total, there is still likely to be a overhead for each search. even if the search is you viewing all orders on the market meaning this would probably also apply to viewing orders on the market.but if they were all the same item name, the best price could be found with a single game-wide search, meaning less load on the database. which would translate into less lag, at the cost of a large one-off database operation.2 - identical ammos of different names can not be mixed in a gun.lets say your flying around using gallente anti-matter charges. you kill someone in pvp and grab a small amount of caldari anti-matter charges of the same size as your guns from their wreck (say, 30 charges because you weren't the first to reach the wreck). these charges are unusable for you, despite having identical stats to the ones your using, because you are unable to mix them with gallente charges in your gun.weapon grouping makes this worse because if you group weapons, you can't just load the caldari charges into one of your guns to use them. you need to spread them across all your grouped guns.3 - identical weapons of different names can not be grouped.lets take gallente and shadow serpentis railguns as the example. identical stats, meaning that before weapon grouping they were fully interchangeable. but now we have weapon grouping, if a player finds that the cheapest way to load their ship is to mix them, they have to chose between paying more or doing without weapon grouping.4 - they add needless complexity to eve.sure, the compare tool allows players to quickly identify modules like this, so it's a very small issue. but it doesn't bring anything into eve. after all, which is more likely in the case of armor repair modules: - 5 factions in the eve universe all came up with identical modules. - one faction invented the module. the rest acquired the blueprints via various means, then slapped their own name on it.i don't care what name ccp chooses when they are merging the items together, and i'm aware it will mean things like the caldari lp store selling gallente ammo if ccp picks one of the existing names, instead of making a new name for that item."
12/28/2008,"i'd rather approach this problem from the opposite end and tweak the item types so that they have slightly (or more than slightly, even) different statlines."
12/28/2008,"what would you do with the currently existing items of the one you change ?alter it to the new one, ****ing off the people who prefer the old stats ?this option works when everyone has their item changed in the same way. but when some people get it changed and others don't, purely because some of them use the module with one flavor text, others use another, with neither giving clues that it is even likely to change people will get angry.or do you rename the existing modules and **** off the people who want the new variant ?worst case: the new variant is considered so much better than the old that everyone using the old wants it. so the old (that everyone has) becomes worthless because supply went up, demand crashed. and the new one stays expensive for ages because it started out with a supply of 0.even if none of them have stats like the original, there will still be people complaining from both groups because ccp gave the item they wanted to someone else, but not them, due to a roll of the dice. and the greater the difference between the modules after the change, the worse the anger will be.if you can solve this problem then your idea should work."

12/28/2008,system database shall not be touched by thy hands
12/28/2008,how about these player empires in 0.0 who have at minimum constellation sovereignty. for example: cva.how about an allowance for such an empire the ability to essentially pay a fee to concord; in order to have their sovereignty 3 and 4 systems to become essentially high sec. while their sov 1-2 become essentially low sec.any piracy occurring in their system results in sec hit and concord coming to smoke them. the player empire themselves have the allowance to basically do as they want. kill who they want; when they want.basically speaking; you are only capable of keeping or getting concord if you have a capital system with sovereignty 4.so what changes? well their empire becomes similar to that of high sec. people can come and go as they wish. the people in the space can only fight each other if they are at war with each other. you can only kill and shoot the home empire if you are at war with them.so theoretically cva for example could pay concord for the protection. neutrals in their space get protection. people can wardec cva and attack them in their space... but neutrals are still safe; if they arent at war.
12/28/2008,"less npcs, not more."
12/28/2008,having alliances have the ability to hire/have concord in even their capital sov is system defeats the purpose of the wild west environment ccp intended for 0.0.any decent alliance's core systems should be safer than high sec and extremely hard most roaming gangs to hit. if they are not well protected than that alliance is doing something really wrong and is likely to be forced out by a stronger alliance.0.0 should be policed by players not npcs. nor should 0.0 become anything remotely like a high sec with significant rewards/thumbs down to this daft idea

12/28/2008,"well i will admit that i personally hate the learning skills not to mention that even after a year of game play i have still not trained 4 of them to lvl5.having said that and be it that i will get flamed by those that oppose my train of thought.the learning skills should stay in, there is no beneficial reason to remove the training skills other than giving new player a faster access to more equipment even compensating the older players that did train all of there learning skill does nothing but to reward them by giving them access to more equipment faster.all of witch i don't agree with, you should have the same requirements to progress in the game as i did or as the elder that had to train all his learning skills, no i have no interest in making it more fun for the newer player, if that makes less people sign up and play the game, nothing has changed then because the same type of person that didn't like the game a year ago wont like it any better now.could this be an incentive to attract or to keep players in the game more so than before, again i say no those people who find that making the decision to take on the learning skills or not as to much to have to deal with are the very same people that won't last in the game any way.as much as i despise the learning skills i do honestly recognize that it keeps the young-lings or better said by another post here the adha crowd at bay, (btw my daughter has adha so i don't want hear any flak about i actually live it).the learning skills is not a game breaker, the learning skills or not broken what you people need to do honestly is all that energy that you have and motivation and drive on stupid **** like this how about directing the very same energy and intelligence at ccp and get them to fix all the damn bugs in the game then you know what, learning skills be damned i be the first one to sign up and support your petition to remove them ok."
12/28/2008,"from my brief perspective...the csm mean very very little and have absolutley no effect on what happens in eve. if ccp wanted to hear their customers opinions why don't they go and read the forums?theres so many long and detailed threads with discussions about issues and possible alterations.it seems that this forum is just here so people don't 'spam' the rest of the forum becuase they think posting here has an affect...in other words, i agree with the opedit: bunyip and others: if you want to prove your ability to help, please go and read 'ships and modules' 'technology lab' 'eve general discussion' and many more. i garuntee you that on the first page of every forum there will be a multiple page thread with concerns to an issue with the game and its balance. the only reason they arent posted here, is becuase that would be a waste of time becuase the people that share those opinions dont bother to read this place"
12/29/2008,"of course you'd still have the list of their past names and keep tabs on them and keep killing them for slights past till you deem the matter settled. no matter if he's crying into his poorly tanking wet paperbag of roleplay or not.it's not a get out of jail free card, it's about adding depth to the game."

12/29/2008,looking good!
12/29/2008,not too sure bout the boost while in mission but not pvp aspect. no other part of the game works that way. what about pvp that happens inside mission/deadspace areas.sad that ccp just tosses some of the legit missile complaints under the rug because some mission runners want hit every type of ship for full damage weapon
12/29/2008,"nah, we need skill for that at least, rank 4 or above. each level shortens activation cycle for 10%, drone link is established at the end of a cycle, cycle length at lvl1 skill is 40secs.or make it chance based like salvagers. module simply looks for drone broadcasts and when it finds it, it re-establishes the link.dont get me wrong, i am speeced in drones and fyling dominix regulary, but seeing insta connection onto drone is a can of worms. and no noob should be able to do that in a second.imagine 50 sentries abandoned at the low sec gates, one dominix with insta linking on abandoned drones..when one pops, he connects to other and he has 5 sentries again. even alt supplying him is a problem.."

12/29/2008,"right now, i make my isk in empire and spend it on 0.0 warfare. the 0.0 pvp is fun, but not very financially rewarding."
12/29/2008,"the fact that you can make more money in empire by running missions where there's practically no risk versus anything else in 0.0 other than high-end moon mining (which most individual players don't do, only their alliances) is idiotic.ccp desperately needs to make 0.0 more profitable to the average space-holding player, which will in turn encourage more people to want to inhabit 0.0 and create more pvp interaction."

12/29/2008,sounds good to me.
12/29/2008,"the way i see it at the moment its a fairly transparent problem; the 'wealth' of .0 and the soveriegnty (read: ownership) of .0 are both tied up with the pos - which itself is a static, ""bunker'esq"" mechanic.decouple sov from the pos, and shift the wealth off the moons and into 'open space' (i.e the belts, or similar open environment) and bingo: problem solved.the pos will still remain a industrial cog, and moon mining might be a part of that - but if you could get moon minerals from the belts themselves...c."
12/29/2008,"oh yeah that sounds ****ing ace, let's remove everything that can be fought over and just run around in pseudo missions in deadspaces that can only be probed out if you have an hour or two to spare. that's the shot of adrenaline 0.0 needs, oh yeah, right in the ****ing eye bro"

12/29/2008,i endorse this idea.

12/29/2008,supporting this
12/29/2008,"faction warfare bunkers should be employed in 0.0 for sovereignty. the 0.0 bunker might be something akin to a stripped down station, no where near the size, yet larger than a pos. this docking solution should support modules such as hangar, maintenance and repair ... and that's it. this type of setup should require anchoring 5 and starbase defense 5 with a long anchoring delay.as a sovereign military installation, it would also be cool to see a series of bunkers communicate with each other so you could see the number of people in those system ... maybe not 'who' but some type of available intel from anchored (and unprotected) radio beacons or something like we see in the missions.maybe it's just a case of bringing more of the mission functionality the story lines have for npcs to the actual game in 0.0."
12/29/2008,"agree that 0.0 needs some love, and like the ideas about being able to upgrade your sov space by better rats and minerals. however, i urge caution on some of the ideas about allowing small ""roaming hac"" gangs to be able to relatively easily destroy static infrastructure. the ability of light hitters to be able to easily damage infrastucture structures is unrealistic and outside the role of these ships...their job is to disrupt infrasture by attacking ships, namely miners and ratters. the doolittle raid on imperial japan in wwii, as a similar ""hit and run"", was insignificant in terms of its effect on the infrastructure it targeted. second, there comes the risk that this creates a whole new headache, trying to defend static structures that are easily popped by any 10-man hac gang in 5 minutes. there is a whole new risk/reward issue here. third, this sort of takes away a role for battleships. they can't hit fast movers for defense, and now they wouldn't be needed to attack infrastructure...so what would they be good for??i guess what i am getting at is, why is it so bad that ""small groups"" are not able to do much against a stronger numerically superior foe that is entrenched with sovereignity? yeah, changing mechanics to minimize the need for monster capital and sub-capital blobs is a good thing, and should be pursued. but don't throw out the baby with the bath-water and make holding 0.0 space more of a headache than it is worth by swinging the pendulum so far over that non-sov-holding ""roaming"" corp/alliances get all the fun and the defenders are left guarding easily popped static structures."

12/29/2008,"poss in themselves aren't the problem, the problem is more the quantity of poss that need to be shot (shooting a handful of poss is fine, shooting 30 is boring as hell) and strontium levels leading to defenders playing the timezone metagame so that poss come out of reinforced at 3am on a weekday morning in the attacker's part of the world.you're right though that every alternate mechanic to pos shooting i've seen has been worse than the mechanic it was supposed to replace.agreement here, the fact that 80-90% of players are rejecting the endgame of 0.0 warfare and sticking to their highsec l4q20 missions and their navy ravens is ample evidence that there simply isn't the incentive to take part in lowsec or zerosec activites that there should be. i would actually say that highsec does need a reduction (maybe only a slight one) in its profitability along with an increase in the attractiveness of 0.0 and lowsec."

12/29/2008,i agree detach the pos form sov and move to a planet baised system. but i would ad rather than agents in outpost controled in 0.0 a mechanice that allowes empire corporate sponsership. perhaps required trade with an empire corporation. less poses means less logistics to maintain space. you would have to replace that aspect of holding space with somthing else. 0.0 is tied to empire threw legistics if you remove the required massive amounts of pos fuel it should be replace with somting else. i find 0.0 very under utalized. befor your alowed to colonize a planet for sov you would have to make a desision on one of the 4 empire work your standings up as a corp and alliance then trade for the technology to terraform a planet and claim soverenty. just a thought

12/29/2008,"i am a little wary of physically moving poss to planets as ccp seems to have plans (even if maybe they're just vague ideas at the moment) for developing the role of planets in a system's structure in the future and without knowing for sure at this stage what they'll be it would be a pain to have poss there getting in the way. perhaps just have the ""xl pos"" which claims a planet at one of its moons, but with the limit of one per planet. again, i'd be wary of the increases in power we would be talking about here - buffing sov poss too much may lead to another 'bring dreads or don't bother' state of play as we had before pos guns moved outside the shields, with sub-capitals becoming obsolete and relegated to gatecamp duty.bringing planets to life - literally - is something that would be very cool to see, although i wouldn't let it apply to all planets, after all its not realistic to terraform a gas giant or an airless iceball. additionally, having terraform-able planets and/or moons (and perhaps even pre-inhabited - i 'm not familiar enough with the eve backstory to know if there are inhabited planets out in 0.0) randomly scattered through the galaxy in the same way as moon minerals are randomly scattered would mean further diversification of 0.0 and a new type of resource to generate friction over - and could lead to interesting 'gold rush' conflicts between 0.0 alliances if areas of space previously considered poor value became more worthwhile due to the discovery of inhabitable worlds within its systems.as an aside, terraforming should be a non-trivial process - i'd suggest as a benchmark figure that terraforming a world be a multi-level process roughly similar in cost cost to the various levels of outpost upgrades, and take several weeks to complete."

12/29/2008,just a add on to my last..what will this new sov and pos develoment do for exploring.. it will make exploring a system way more dangerous....any thoughts on this?
12/29/2008,"i think it's an excellent idea, i'm just concerned that it might make exploration very difficult with a pos shooting at you while you're trying to drop probes. anyway, just a thought...."
12/29/2008,"no, it's not my call. it's the call of the ****ing player base who don't even consider the potential rewards of 3-4bn isk deadspace loot drops to be worth their time exploring, you ****ing ******. let me repeat that, if you do exploration, you get 4bn isk. yet people do not explore. they'd rather grind l4s in motsu for 3 months than doing exploration. why? beacuse that trite **** is more exciting than ****ing exploration(also, the deadspace boosters on contracts right now mostly don't even come from exploration, so if not for the alternatives the prices would be like, officer cap recharger territory, and then how would the motsu l4'ers afk run their missions!?!?)"
12/29/2008,"good point, they should just kill of the entire exploration thing altogheter, it was terrible anyway. just bring back static complexes and we can pretend it never happened."

12/29/2008,"regarding the idea of moving sov holding structures to planets:i want people to be aware of this issue: many people warp to planets for various reasons - sometimes in combat, other times to scan belts. if we have sov claiming stuff at the planets, those structures should not automatically kill whatever warps there. either they should have passive defense measures, or they must be positioned at least 300 km from the planet warp to point, out of gun range.it may not seem like a big issue now, but it will be once it is used on massive scale in eve."

12/29/2008,change is good!
12/29/2008,"actually buffing something for once instead of a nerf.... supported!as for those small gang objectives...here's a couple of ideas:-solar batteries at pos that have to be outside of shields and are easily incapacitated, but while they're online, they reduce actual fuel costs for running said pos (only 2 per tower max)-local as it currently stands is agreed to be broken as an intel tool (at least, from what i understand and think) which it was never intended to be... well, here's a thought - anchorable structure at sun that provides current local functionality to 0.0, but is easily incapacitated, putting local into delayed mode-re:cynojammers - it's kinda early in morning, so this may be something really bad, but anyway, here goes: right now, we have one big cynojammer covering the whole system - why not split this functionality up into smaller structures? these smaller cynojammers would each individually jam only a portion of the system (let's say 5 au around themselves) and be easier to incapacitate than the current jammer, but multiple could be linked together to jam the whole system. but, as soon as over 33% of the linked jammers are incapped, the systemwide jamming goes offline and only the individual jammers remain in effect. (this should be limited to a maximum of 3 jammers per planet, else this will only promote even moar pos spammage )further ideas along these lines should go (imho) along the lines of easily incapacitatable small structures which give system-wide benefits (which are small enough as to not be overpowering, yet significant enough to be worth defending).as for sov. mechanics... anything that reduces pos spam is good - ideally, controlling planets should grant you (higher levels of) sov., but until something like that is in place, the idea posted here should do."
12/29/2008,sounds good to me.
12/29/2008,"i think, this heads the right way."
12/29/2008,"while i like most of what i have seen so far i see a problem here. giving the possibility to produce trade goods to 0.0 alliances mean removing even the last link between empire and 0.0. in theory empire and 0.0 are in a symbiotic relationship, 0.0 is the frontier where you can gain and lose big fortunes in a very small time, empire is the old lands where the skilled laborers are, where are produced the things that make life more comfortable, ecc. if all the goods can be produced in 0.0, that relationship die. at that point we will be really playing in 2 different, unrelated, games, where there is no need to move from an area to the other, forever. ---an idea about stations: unless something has changed (i have never been a station owner so i can be mistaken), the owner of a station don't get any of the taxes on the items that pass through the station market. that seem strange to me. the idea of giving the station tax (not the broker fee) to the station owner seem a basic one. it would be a great incentive to the development of better markets in 0.0 and give a reward to the station owners."

12/29/2008,"first, some notes on the previous csm posts.notes:there is a lot here, so i won't go point to point:pos warfare is only boring in two regards.1. too many sov objectives2. too difficult to achieve strategic goals that do not involve direct sovereignty control.the actual fights at the pos are fun. the challenges that arise to get a foothold and bring in resources, is fun. the problem comes when you have 30 pos to purge and no one is defending. if that number were more reasonable then there would be very little problem.plundering specifically is a very bad mechanic. it is going to either have all the problems with strontium or all of the problems with ping pong and more. if you have a system where people can come in and take static resources that have been acquired then you will have a system where its impossible to producing using the plunderable options. they will be robbed during your off times.dynamic rat spawns and pos/outpost modules are a bad idea. dynamic spawns are bad because it leads to an unpredictability in what systems will be the most productive. systems that are more productive are more desirable for organizations and individuals. this means that a predictable quality of spawns in an area is good for bringing people together to fight.you can see this exemplified most easily for moons. its what organizations fight over. if you had quality ratting ground to fight over you would see more conflict. if its dynamic then all space is going to be roughly equally valuable. and that does not generate conflict.pos/outpost modules are a bad idea simply because they give the people who own the area another added advantage. as one of our goals is to bring people to 0.0, people are going to need to be able to produce well without the aid of these structures. basically you need a system that produces on an individual level only when that person is in the area.you have the same kind of problem with missions, but i think its slightly reduced by the increased density that it leads too. small gangs inflicting sov damage is not a good idea. while more defenses are bad, a move that would allow small gangs to influence sov would be a massive change in the level of power needed to remove sov. it would become effectively impossible to hold. the problem lies entirely in the barriers to entry for killing strategic pos modules such as miners, bridges, and cynos.if you make taking down and putting up these types of modules faster and easier then small gangs have a real place on the battlefield. not as a main tactic, but as support. it should also be noted that there already are ways for small gangs to be useful, they just are not so explicit as many would like.get rid of it. with the exception of strontium, pos fueling serves no purpose in eve. roll the cost into the structures. a pos that is not tended will not provide a lasting deterrent to its destruction. if a constant cost is deemed to be required as a game mechanic, then make that constant cost be deducted from the corporation wallet automatically and give directors a proper pos management system that informs them of status without bunking up their mail. that way players can ""delegate"" the fueling of pos to npcs. ""logistics"" should be ""getting ships and men to the front"" and not ""making sure everything is fueled""."
12/29/2008,"no, they should not. one of the problems in 0.0 is the inability of new entities to get involved. making things harder to kill increases the barriers to entry for attacking sovereignty.while less sov related small gang activities ought to also be present, increasing the barrier to entry for attacking sovereignty would be counter productive in that regard.if this happens, it has to be permanent increases(i.e. not gone when you kick the folks out) and there have to be realistic and known limits that enforce a hierarchy in terms of quality of space. otherwise we may run into a problem where all space becomes equally good as people max out their improvements.___________________________________________________now a list of some things that are very important to get big picture righton sovereignty and posthe mechanic of: side one places structure to claim, side 2 kills structure to reduce claim needs to be preservedthe number of structures need to be reducedthe strategic and logistical functions of pos need to be removed from the structures that hold sov: there is a fundamental break in the level of effort required to advance against each that cannot be served when they are melded togethera system similar to the strontium mechanic needs to be preserved for any built up asset that can be destroyed or plunderedother plunderable assets must not incur loss of activity prior to the point that it was plundered or after it is resecuredon enhancing the value of 0.0any player influenced improvements must be permanent: temporary changes reduce the incidence that a region will be attackedit should not be possible to ""gimp"" a region with said upgradesplayer improvements must not allow an optimal improvement strategy to end up with regions of equal valueflat improvements need to be aimed at individual rather than corporate or alliance productionflat improvements need to end up with regions of differing value"

12/29/2008,"i truly support making 0.0 life more worth it to individual players. revamping how 0.0 mechanics work just seems like the best solution, not some nerf/boost to pos-mechanics. the changes darius and vuk puts to the table seem to have good points, and with ccp's refinement they might make eve a lot more interesting for us who want to live in 0.0, and not participate in the empire factional warfare. bringing missions to 0.0 through some standings-mechanics might also be a good way to start, but pos mechanics are the true clinching point.ankhwhatever, your points are sometimes self-defeating, and sometimes just seem... not so well thought out. looting and small gang pvp-points in particular. eve should not be about wow-like raiding parties.thank you csm's, for trying to make our game more fun."
12/29/2008,technically there is. those moons are big earners. the moment suicide gankers' insurance gets nerfed officer mods will sky rocket in price. plus a system for empire to consume far more of wat 0.0 has to offer. one option obviously being the above suicide ganker option. another would be tournament arenas that consume and destroy mods if you lose.would there be some sort of reversing factor of this? npc agents :) so beautiful an idea.i love to see the big alliances coming out :)
12/29/2008,"making it easier to challenge sov is a good thing, but making a small roaming gang capable of doing it will only become a headache as someone already pointed out, you can't make it too easy...i think making it easier for the average player to make more isk in 0.0 is also a good idea, maybe the systems that get ratted empty more often generate better rats than a system that is not ratted in as often. or vice versa a system that doesnt get ratted in generates better rats than one that has 10 people ratting in it 24/7/365(or something just an example)i do agree completely though that the main isk makers should be the individuals, not the corp or alliance with static ops funneling in huge sums of money.as for getting people out of empire, why not have an event that temporarily makes empire not so secure? i know this is going out on a limb but as an example, concord goes on strike, leaving empire undefended for a week or two. or better yet, someone ****es off the jovians, so they decide to come rip up empire for a few weeks, maybe it could become an event where the eve community must defeat the invading power to restore security to 1.0.this would cause a mass exodus of players from empire, boost 0.0 corp populations and maybe even help form new alliances.also what about random wormholes, let's say one opens up in ""alliance a's"" territory, leading to ""alliance b's"" space. suddenly this new wormhole connecting one end of the universe to the other, not only allows, but forces corps and alliances that wouldn't normally have much exposure to eachother, to be face to face and either fight or join forces. also the randomness would make it an ""iffy"" proposition to go through, what if you're attacking the other alliance and the wormhole closes behind you, leaving you 40+ jumps from home? i agree with the suggestions made by the csm members, but think you should be very careful how easy you make it to destroy sov, and also think you should try to suggest a wide range of things that could benefit the entire game, even if it could be at the expense of someone playing now. whats good for the future of eve, may not be the most liked suggestion."

12/29/2008,"also, since we're talking about buffing 0.0....any way to get better-quality lowends to spawn out there? stuff like ""superdense veldspar"" or something--basically looking to make it economically viable to mine something other than abc.right now, the macrominers in empire supply 0.0, since it is far, far more economical in both time and isk to buy and export trit/pyer/mex/iso from empire than it is to mine it 'locally'. plus the amounts available are presently insufficient for most alliances' needs. a few million units of trit is the barest starting amount for most capital or even battleship construction jobs. its even to the point where it far more efficient to melt rat loot than it is to mine lowends. this needs to change.a change like this would also buff crappy nulsec regions that otherwise aren't any better than lowsec--if you get superdense omber/hed/hemo, you suddenly have an obvious incentive to mine in fountain as opposed to khanid or devoid (not that you'd mine there to begin with, but just sayin')"
12/29/2008,"10 page to long didnt read it all so if these have already been posted, sorry.- boring pos warfare and pos fuelling is tediousalong with making the planet pos for sov maybe make it so only one tower per alliance can be in system (oldest tower holds the sov). x time = higher sov.pro: if you have two big teams trading blows then there are only 2 timers. your tower and theirs. this makes less time waiting around for the next tower to come out and it will make for better fights because it will be an all or nothing for both sides. none of this, ""lets wait and hold the system repping and pos shooting for 18 hours at a time.only having one tower will make pos fueling better too.con: this could be exploited by having many alliances working together to hog all the planets. resolution to this would be to make the non-sov towers cost additional fuel after x time. this will help make that exploit more costly and force any attacking fleet to pull out of a system until that additional cost timer leaves. forcing them to change their attack plan on someone or gtfo.- useless 0.0 space and lack of income sources for individuals 0.0make the value of the space based on sov. the higher the sov the better and faster spawns of rats, minerals, and complex. a sov 4 would also include agents for the local pirate factions.pro: if you tie sov directly to gaining profit, having sov will be worth something. making a high sov system able to support more players will cause less space needed to fund a large corp.agents in 0.0 for sov 4 would solve solo operations. could also make non-ratted mining belts too so someone can mine without fear of rats.con: with current 0.0 population there will be even more space that is unused. but this could allow more space for empire folk.edit:more thoughts for boring pos warfaremake pos modules killable. right now it is incap them and leave them. making them killable will drain liquid recourses faster causing sov fights to take less time. also less repping so more shooting.make towers reinforce if they get to hull and not armor, and make it so you can only add stront at 50% armor and 50% shield. this will cause a larger window for attacking a tower coming out of reinforce and off set the less need for repping pos modules/guns.moon poss get industrial bonuses if that corps alliance has sov.doomsday should be changed to one target, more damage and shorter cool down. aim for it would be an anti cap ship / tower softener weapon.to help the transition, they can make the planet pos tower in game and only placeable if you have sov 1 or higher. after a month switch the new sov rules. this would allow corps to get their planet towers up before the switch."

12/29/2008,"low-grade fluff. if it can be done without causing lag, go for it, but if it does then it's not worth it."
12/29/2008,so that's 3 bytes per ship?3 bytes x 1000 = 3 killobytes of data to take in... cache...and render.i think you have your math messed up.... might wana try again.that would hurt even a 56k as no dial up modem is truly 56kyou still have my support.. but it should be carefully evaluated as it could cause latency.now if you had an option to shut it off where its just default skins... that would work for me.

12/29/2008,"atm triage is hardly ever used on carriers, and there should be some sort of buff for it.my proposal is to make triaged carriers able to rep sieged dreads.it would make triage finaly worth fitting on a carrier"
12/29/2008,supporting my own thread
12/29/2008,i like the change but disagree on triage not being useful.
12/29/2008,we use triage all the time
12/29/2008,this serves only to increase the dominance of capship warfare and further push subcaps to the sidelines. the whole point of siege mode is that its a trade-off which should be used with caution because dreads can't be remote repped and can't get away. giving them the get out of jail free card by letting triaged carriers rep them takes away too much of the risk.
12/29/2008,respin my idea thread?the reason i made it motherships only is because they arent that plentiful. no alliance will have the ability to drop 100 motherships.5 motherships likely the upper limit.i made the idea triage only because that balances it in that you dont have superb logistics + gank at the same time.makes sense for motherships anyway... considering how brutal they got nerfed with hictors.
12/29/2008,"5 motherships is most definitely not the upper limit. i saw 8 motherships just chillin' at a pos last week. regardless, the ability to rep sieged dreads is a terrible idea."
12/29/2008,"rep sieged dreads? with triage-level repping? hell no!however, a cap-use reduction on the remote reppers would be a welcome thing--at the moment, the best way to use triage is the ""suicide fit"" which is basically all cap mods. reducing the rep use amount would allow for a few tanking mods. still, i'd say the worst bit about triage is the logistics 5 requirement, but i can also see why it should remain exclusive to those that really want it."
12/29/2008,no way this will ever get in game.
12/29/2008,"i had a proposal to buff triage some months ago in f+i, though it wasn't this. basically, make capital remote reps half as good - either by doubling their cycle time, or by halving amount repped and cap cost if you prefer - and then make the triage bonuses -75% cycle time and +300% amount repped. the baseline modules would still be a fair bit bigger than large, but they'd be half as good as present for half the cap per second while triage would be twice as good for the same cap per second. it'd make carrier rr blobs less effective, while giving triage a really big buff - one carrier in triage being as good as 16 outside it is a pretty significant boost. i don't think making sieged dreads reppable is the solution, since that basically just forces players to kill carriers before they start on dreads, which makes capital warfare cheaper and poses harder to defend. it's at least plausible as a mothership buff - seriously, how many moms are you willing to lock down unreppable for 10 minutes in order to keep your dreads alive? - but it shouldn't be an option for regular carriers."
12/29/2008,triage moms are in a precarious situation; balanced by their tremendous advantage of rr obviously. the situation would be that moms would be able to rep each other; but it could lead to allowing fleets to show up within the 10minute window who will be able to overwhelm the motherships and lead to destroying those.it's a self-balancing situation. not to mention due to triage's 50% duration bonus; really hurts cap and makes it not so sustainable if you're the one being shot at.in my opinion it would be a good and fair boost to motherships.
12/29/2008,"if moms can triage-rep each other, then moms become unkillable, since nobody will use them outside of obscene rr blobs. have you ever looked at the numbers a triage ship can put out? it's disgustingly high, the fact that it can't be used on itself is the only reason it's not ludicrously good. and no, cap isn't an issue, because triage buffs cap transfers as well. triaged ships must never, ever be usable on each other. on something else(i.e., sieged dreads), maybe, but not on each other."
12/29/2008,"if you've ever been involved in pvp, you've had the inevitable time where you're stuck on a gate, looking at your ship, with your shields, armor and structure all deep in the red, yet, your ship is still there. you're experiencing a desynch, where what you see isn't what is necessarily occurring.for me, i've actually had several similar occurrences, where i've actually been stuck in the warp tunnel after experiencing a gatecamp, and this warp hasn't ever ended, meaning that i've had to log off and log back in, only to find that either my pod was now flying through space, or my clone was just being revived in my station.obviously, when you see that you are still in your ship, you have that feeling that, yes, your ship actually survived the camp, and then when you get the inevitable lossmail/podmail, you immediately petition it, because hell - i can still see my ship!we, of course, get the near-immediate, ""we cannot find any problem, so you're out of luck"" response.now, i know that this is common, yet consider this: when mission runners have their ""mission item"" stolen, it is not uncommon for them to petition it, and have a mod give it back to them! how is that even remotely fair?(yes, i realize that sometimes the mods will say ""working as intended"", or ""cancel the mission"" or even ""retry the mission when it resets after downtime"", but i've heard the ""check your cargo hold, because i'll send you the mission item"" story one too many times to be happy with it.)so, i'm proposing either the mods make a strictly followed rule book when it comes to petitions (and please, provide us with the rules - it'll cut down on the number of petitions you receive, i promise) or they start being more fair to those who lose their ship due to desynch, lag, or what-have-you. take our word for it once in a while. just because your systems don't show an error, doesn't mean one didn't happen.support this thread if you'd like to see balanced petition responses!(...and yes, this is one of the issues i'm planning on for my platform for csm in the third term.)"
12/29/2008,supporting my own thread.
12/29/2008,"they shouldn't ever do that.they can't reimburse the ship when they don't have an evidence that it was a fault on their part. i think you know what would happen if they would just take anyones word for it.i do think mission objects, no matter how they were lost, should not be reimbursed though."
12/29/2008,"the difference here, however, is that lag and desynch exists, and just because ccp's record keeping doesn't show an issue, doesn't mean one doesn't happen.perhaps there should be some type of error logging implemented on the client side, so that they can provide the information they found to ccp when a petition happens. this would better support the claim, and would go a long way to figuring out the best way to fix the underlying issue."
12/29/2008,"if you make it so that any ship loss can be replaced by petition -> desynch -> ""trust me."", then all of a sudden no ship would ever die. nobody wants that."
12/29/2008,"i'm not saying that at all, but we need some type of balance in the petition process. are you telling me that someone who's lost a ship in the process of attempting to escape, and while they see that they've been successful, yet it's not so, should just suck it up and accept it?if there was a way to compare logs - then i can see two things of benefit. one, the client log could show that the the pilot was, in fact, correct and that they should receive a ship reimbursement. two, it could be used by ccp to further troubleshoot both client and server issues.when there's a problem with some software, we're asked for a technical rundown (dxdiag, anyone?) of our system to weed out possible bugs/compatibility issues. who's to say that the client shouldn't also be responsible for this?microsoft has been doing it for years with their ""your program has encountered an error and needs to close, click here to submit a bug report"" text. (ib ""microsoft sucks"".) if we had some method such as this to dispute the unbalanced moderation, it could go a long way to fixing an obvious problem.for the record, i'm not interested in a ""trust me"" button, but i do want a ship to be reimbursed when it can be proven that 'something happened'."
12/29/2008,"no.... its impossible to prove....try taking the time to learn tcp/ip and internet functionality and you'll figure out real quick that such a thing is a nightmare to program and figure out.if ccp started taking your word for every little incident... they would have to honor such things elsewhere.and that would pretty much screw the whole damn system over.they can't track descychro's or lag... because such a thing is not something tangible.lag is a pause.... no contact... which could be as simple as someone pulling the plug on your modem.... a power outage.... an idiot smacking into a power pole in the local area.... or you getting infected with a virus.... or the isp spilling coffee on there hardware... or better yet... you abruptly quitting the game and then claiming you lost your ship. course most times lag is just an interuption in the connection stream so to speak.... but if its too long... things get a bit interesting as far as packets reaching you and you responding in likewise fashion. in order to ""resynch"" you have to ""reset"" your connection to the server.how the heck can they know that to be the truth with you claiming losses in light of any number of variables? they don't even grant massive 500 to 1000 vs 1000 fleet fights refunds on there ships being stuck on the grid... duh?case and point: i have my main gaming tower and a laptop... each running eve client...the eve client on the laptop hung when i ""alt tabbed"" too many times.... had to reboot... go figure.... but what was interesting is my ""alt"" was still logged in as far as everyone else considered for nearly 5 minutes straight... then abruptly logged off. it's a bit weird to watch ""yourself"" in that situation.would have been interesting if i had logged in before the server finally booted me off.now i ask you.... knowing what i just described... you honestly believe your proposal has any feasibility at that point?ccp has a hard enough time figuring out fact from fiction... lets not make it any worse."
12/29/2008,"that would rely on ccp being able to trust those players completely. but unless they can show this trust to everyone, they will be favouring some players over others which is not a good road to go down.up until someone goes and hacks their log to show what they want it to show."
12/29/2008,i'm not recommending a text file be sent to ccp - there are many more secure ways to get the point across.
12/29/2008,"unless you can find an alternative that would work without being abusable, yes, that's exactly what i'm proposing. it sucks, a lot, but i can't see anything better. and i don't think client-size tracking is better. remember, the whole principle behind the client is that it's a dumb terminal, because if anything happens client-side it'll get hacked and abused for benefit. are you trying to say that that couldn't happen here? i'm not exactly a hacker of legend, but i could probably cheat my way out of losses easily with a bit of fiddling. even if they did something overkilly like encrypt the logs, it'll still get broken. remember, a quarter-million players can do anything profitable that's physically possible in an astoundingly short period of time. don't give them this level of abuse potential."
12/29/2008,"such as ?anything client side can be hacked, including the client itself, because of the simple fact that given someone enough access to run the client is also giving them enough access to alter it.so if hacking the client side logging will give an advantage, someone will hack the logging code to generate favourable logs.so how do you propose preventing this ?"
12/29/2008,things are fine as they are now - no need for a change.
12/29/2008,i support this idea if for no reason other than the hostility the op encountered by the first few responses.safer and easier mining for all! \o/ can flippers can go suck a lemon.
12/29/2008,"this isn't the worst idea seen on the csm.that said, it's probably the worst idea i've seen today."
12/29/2008,do not want.i would much rather like to see all the jetcan miners be banned for them exploiting the game by using jetcan's
12/29/2008,"this idea is dumb, mostly for being unnecessary, but a lot of the posts here are even dumber. jetcan mining is not an exploit - it's originally unintended, but legitimate and quite well balanced due to the ability to steal it."
12/29/2008,this
12/29/2008,"the simple answer to this whole issue is for ccp to run the numbers on what the maximum possible mining yield in m3 is with all skills and fleet bonuses at lvl v on a hulk, and change the capacity of gsc to that number. would probably be a damn easy change too. currently, jet can mining is the only reasonable way to go without a ton of micro managing and floating around to other cans. the other fix would be to take the 5000m limit from anchoring gscs, so we can make clusters of them to cram full of ore while the hauler flies back and forth to station. supporting this idea anyway, it would solve the problem and give us a new toy to mess with."
12/29/2008,"yet another good idea is the ability for a skilled/trained player to be able to scoop/loot the gsc by hacking the can. (hey, you have to balance the increased capacity with increased chance of loss, too.)"
12/29/2008,"people do know what is best for them, and the people voted. no support, long live the csm."
12/29/2008,"if we can force the csm to bring up this with ccp, it should prove to be an entertaining discussion."

12/29/2008,supported!
12/29/2008,good idea
12/29/2008,"hmm, can of worms..imagine a bs with a tractor beam and sensor booster, just caught a hauler in low sec..it starts to tractor it from the jumping range of the gates..some lag and some other ****, and hauler is no more able to jump through..or catching some miner in low sec belt, tractoring him for hours around while keeping point on him..but yeah, would make nice tactics on this station huggers :)"
12/29/2008,"great idea!sounds good to me! (am i missing something? where's the downside?)yes, i realize that you might, one day, be the 'victim' of such a play, however, both of the examples you've provided are exactly the tactics we're looking to employ!we want to stop a hauler from jumping. we want to tractor a miner off his roids. we want to hold things for as long as possible, and ransom or kill them."
12/29/2008,"i still love this idea, i posted the same thing about 2 years ago only as a counter to nanos. needless to say, nano pilots were about as happy about the idea as that hauler pilot getting sucked off the gate was..lol i also brought it up at a round table @ fanfest o7.. the devs werent keen on it either, they just didnt get the combat properties a tractor beam has. nuttin but funny faces and a quick move to the next topic, ambulation....uuuuggg"
12/29/2008,"amusing, but not even slightly reasonable."
12/29/2008,"you forgot ""imho"". beyond that, why do you feel it's unreasonable? sci-fi movies have been doing it for years."
12/29/2008,"i believe he said ""slightly reasonable"" as opposed to unreasonable.as to why... i would venture a guess as to this would open a can of worms of issues as far as exploitation/abuse and other fun little loop holes that people love to exploit.while there are many good things about the idea... there could be too many bad things about it.hence why i did not give my support.... i'm still waiting for the last 'push' over the edge in either direciton."
12/29/2008,"actually, he said ""not even slightly reasonable"" which is ""unreasonable"" in my book.this is where i tend to agree, since i would think that the use of a tractor beam on other ships would obviously be the same as using a web, point (etc.) and give aggro.(hey, if it didn't, i wouldn't give my support. can you imagine all the complaints you'd get if we could suddenly tractor people in empire with no repercussions? funny, but 100% imbalanced, imho.)it's all about balance. i don't believe the op is recommending we just let anyone start tractoring without some form of aggro. that would just be stupid.have i pressed the issue significantly enough?"
12/29/2008,i stand corrected....however.... my point remains... this is very unrefined as far as proposals go.
12/29/2008,"basically, eve's combat model doesn't do things like that well. same reason we'll never see joystick flight. this isn't a wing commander game, and tactical positioning is hard to manage and doesn't much matter. if it was implemented it'd either be too good - like a super-web, tearing people away from stations and gates - or utterly worthless. i don't want frigate rag dolls, and i definitely don't want combat rorquals. and no matter how it was implemented, it'd be too hard to manage effectively. i just don't see it working. if you can give me an implementation that'd be good, then i'd change my mind, but i can't envision one."
12/29/2008,"yes, logistics should be on km if helping your opponent, just dont know what weapon should be there.."
12/29/2008,yes please. km *****s unite and form voltron!
12/29/2008,i totally agree..unless ccp is going to give us some kind of set bonuses (navy mega with all gallente stuff..) then i dont think its worth separating modules by their faction names..
12/29/2008,"they have different names because they are given by different people. altering their stats will anger those with them already, and moving them all to one item will mean 4 separate factions do not get the item in their lp stores.no"
12/29/2008,this.
12/29/2008,much better approach.
12/29/2008,"or, keep them separate, and allow search by item type and meta level. problem solved."
12/29/2008,"i never said anything about removing them from the lp stores. in fact, i said that it would mean that some lp stores have items named after other factions.that would solve the search issue for contracts. but not for the market. and the market does check each if each type is in stock when you hit the group page, if not sooner, even if you aren't planning to buy that specific ammo (for example, when your after antimatter s, it still has to check the other small hybrid ammos).it would not solve the problem of not being able to mix ammo, nor would it solve the problem of not being able to group them even when the stats are identical. grouping weapons could be fixed by checking for the identical weapons, but ammo mixing would require the server to keep track of the mix of ammo.we could get an option to rename the item to one of the other identical ones to fix those issues.except that it would require ccp to figure out what stat changes they could give them, the exact numbers to keep them balanced, and how to avoid angering people who already have one of that group of identical items.so how would you make them different ?how would you avoid the appearance of favouring some players over others ?for most of the items involved, especially ammo, most corps will be able to get hold of one variant much easier than the others simply because of the mission runners nearest to them. so the ones that have their source considered best* after this will be the ones that ccp appears to be favouring.*and i don't see how you can avoid having one considered better than the others in the general case. even if the others are better in some specific cases.rename them and only the people who care about roleplay will have any reason to complain. throw out something about how the factions with modules being renamed are admitting to not inventing it in the first place and it should satisfy most of them.unless your willing to argue that they managed to design identical items independently.so advantage does altering their stats bring that makes up for these disadvantages ?"
12/29/2008,i bump this only so i can say....errrrrr what??????
12/29/2008,"why do they have to be equal? damage is the backbone of combat, ewar is just combat support."
12/29/2008,i'm confused by what the op is asking for?does he want invulns basic res bonus to be boosted to 50-60% instead of the usual 30%? with single mods being 80-90%in other words... officer invulns becoming tech 2 and presumably officers becoming even better?or does he want eccm built into the shield tank mods?i'm confuddled.
12/29/2008,"op thinks that an item to counter a secondary aspect of combat should be no better than an item to counter a primary aspect of combat. tell you what, naomi. when the average ship carries as many jammers as guns, then i'd make invulns equal to eccm. until then, learn to play."
12/29/2008,the op would like to see shield hardeners in line with eccm modules. why? i have no idea. they really aren't related other than being passive defense modules.
12/29/2008,one deals with shields... the other deals with electronic warfare.how does this have anything to do with either or?o_o
12/29/2008,"man seriously, stop spamming petitions, a few posts back you wanted more petitions --->"
12/29/2008,didn't you already make this thread once? and didn't everybody tell you to go take a flying leap? you'd think it might be a good idea to take the hint.
12/29/2008,thanks for the bumpguess this isnt too high on the csm ppl's minds right now. but would like this to be brought up.
12/29/2008,why not just make it that u can unanchor instantly? or maybe 30secs..
12/29/2008,"as a gallente ewar specialist and minor engineer/industrialist, i've been looking for new ways to enhance the effectiveness of the gallente recon ships. i gave up on that idea and started thinking ewar period.why can't i combine a sensor booster, a heavy energy transfer and a few module scanners so i could target the modules of another ship and with thermodynamics, overload the targeted ship's module?offensively, this could be used to support fleet members modules with a temporary overload for increased ank(my term for gank and tank). defensively, it could be used in a similar manner to overload a module into a destructive state rendering it useless. regardless of use, if the targeted module goes inactive before it's destroyed, it's moot, so the recipient does has some control over what happens.given the coming t3 ships, perhaps this could be included.??utari"
12/29/2008,"interesting, but i think that the new mod should not overload the enemy modual as such, just damage it, and it should have a chance to 'hit or miss' like jamming, theres a chance you could damage the mod, but you could also not do any damage atall.on the support side, i think this is a bad idea, ccp would have to implement a system where you can choose what mods you wish to overload (much work) because if you overload all of your gang mates mods, well...reios"
12/29/2008,it would be overwpoered. spam 30 ferigs like that on dread or carier.
12/29/2008,"i can see why you wouldn't want a war, but as most have said, no avioding it, unless you jump corps a lot, or just join an npc corp.eve's all about pvp.but it does raise another point funny enough,i don't agree with the people in npc corps don't have the same access to corp/fleet stuff, like say a pos, easy enough to leave an alt behind in your main corp and everyone else stay in npc,we all know about the corps that attack a smaller corp/carebears for kicks only to find there friendly with a larger corp/alliance and when help arrives they all leave the corp that got a war dec for attacking the corp they thought they could take.what they end up with is a corp that can't be at war, unless the corp attacking is willing to sit outside a station waiting for an alt to undock that never will. meanwhile the people that jumped to npc corps go mining, do missions, dock in front of you, and not a thing you can do.for me anyway empire wars is broken, i think the complete oppisate, it's too easy to aviod a war in empire. you said yourself you're new to the game, give it time, you'll learn how to deal with it."

12/29/2008,for me there is 2 reasons to get rid of the learning skills. they are boring and they make the attributes insignificant.i got all my learning skills trained to 5/4. i would not object to have them removed if the sp/attribute point was doubbled. it will make the game better even if it do not help me.
12/29/2008,"the best thing you can do is every single time you talk to ccp, or the rest of the csm, no matter how small and insignificant the issue, you tell us about it. what you talked about, your and their reactions, and everything in between.if you want people to take the csm seriously, you need to start making us believe you are doing the job we voted you in for."
12/29/2008,i don't see what the problem is. if the price of low end minerals in 0.0 makes it unprofitable to mine then there cant be a supply shortage. i don't think ccp should introduce a super concentrated form of veld just because some people in 0.0 cant be bothered to mine what's there already.

12/30/2008,this is a great idea.the transport of goods between the planetary hub and the planet itself could be via npc convoys which occur at random times. these would be rich targets for roaming gangs so would need to be actively defended.

12/30/2008,nice idea and should be easy to implement
12/30/2008,"it is a move in the right direction, but i don't think that it goes far enough to fix the problems. it will fix things like pos spamming wars to some extent, but that's about it?as people have said the fix needs to encourage the two entities to fight / make war / pew pew. this does not do this imo."
12/30/2008,"i support fundamental improvements to 0.0 and support changes in the way sovereignity is implemented. a move from moon pos to planet pos could be a good one if it means less structures to waste time on (ie: just 1 structure instead of having to do like 15 posin a system, even if that single structure is harder to kill). ofcouse there is room for many more improvements, so let the ideas continue to show up here. ccp will have to decide in the end what to do with it."
12/30/2008,"i'm very much interested in seeing less of the precious 0.0 space in this game be completely worthless. given the growing player base, it just seems silly to have so much space be absolutely useless.additionally, the idea that npc 0.0 space is often better than conquerable 0.0 has always seemed a bit incongruous to me. it would be nice to see that change substantially.while i do not like pos warfare or the current sov mechanics, i am a bit nervous about the idea of fiddling with these things. there just seems to be so much potential for making things worse or just as bad (but in a different way) than what we already have. still, it's worth looking into."
12/30/2008,"i thought of some pvp incentives for 0.0:1) allow small roaming gangs a way to steal part of the goods that moon pos produces. it should be balanced in such a way as it takes a long time to steal stuff - basically, almost like roid mining, but this one is pos mining. and the rate of supply transfer would depend on number of people involved. so 1 person could never get much.this would create incentive for hostiles to come into alliance space to get rich off undefended pos. at same time, the defenders would be alerted that someone's stealing their shit and assemble a gank squad to counter them.balance things just right, and both sides will be eager to fight.2) reduce the usage of jump bridges and jump freighters. simplest way - make it much more expensive. this will force more people to use 0.0 gates for travel, and more gate travel means more targets for pvp.this is the way it was for years in eve before the jump bridges and titans got introduced. and it was good, so nothing extreme here. it would be great to see alliances gather escort missions again, or see some ratters use real gates to travel."
12/30/2008,"i have participated in discussions like that before, having ""one"" military outpost to claim sov in a system.at a significant higher price (5+bil?) then a pos but for that extra isk's you get fitting, clonning services and a limited personal/corp/alliance hangar. system jammers, scanner, guns , ecm , cyno beacons and bridge should be possible to equip to your deathstar. the pos gunner can now sit inside the outpost and shoot. (yay windows)upgrades follows the same foundation, pedestal, monument as a regular outpost but now you get more cpu/power to equip more and heavier weapons for every sov lvl you gain +isk for the platform ofc.otherwise it should follow the normal behaviors of a pos like reinforcment / fuel requirements.it should be anchorable even at gates, just to increase the we own this space feeling.normal pos's should be left as they are but without a sov point, and to kill any normal pos's in a sov system you need to take down the military outpost if such is present in the same system.and last when it dies it really dies :-)/got a little carried away there"
12/30/2008,"my base assumption is that the time sink simply isn't worth it. as a matter of fact is says that right in the post you quoted. i didn't get into details because details are for devs to work out. i really could care less whether the solution for upgrading space involves increased spawns, roids, agents, whatever. the high level idea is that space needs to increase in value to account for the investment in time to make it worthwhile.the risk vs. reward structure is completely skewed so that there's no incentive for new players to band together to claim space in 0.0. you see it is a massive timesink, but people will invest in a time sink if the payoff is there. today it's not. ignoring your editorialization i wouldn't have a problem with any of the 4 mentioned ideas you've listed. as a matter of fact all 4 have been discussed in the past both here and on the goonfleet forums."

[l. incentivum.] that which moves or influences the mind, or operates on the passions; that which incites, or has a tendency to incite, to determination or action; that which prompts to good or ill; motive; spur; as, the love of money, and the desire of promotion, are two powerful incentives to action.what your crystal ball tells you people care about doesn't make for a very compelling game. if 0.0 was worth the effort, more people would expend it. more people working to conquer space means more fighting. some variety would be a good thing. most of 0.0 is far from profitable in comparison to the cost of maintaining the space, and the benefit to the individual is tiny when contrasted against npc space, or one of the few regions which for some strange reason have npc truesec throughout.i'd personally love to nuke empire, but i don't see that happening anytime soon. i'll settle for the realistic."
12/30/2008,these are actually ideas extracted from others at fanfest. most are neither original or my own. this isn't the thread for your terrible and poorly written propaganda.
12/30/2008,"while nearly all 0.0 regions are ""claimed"" by some alliance or another, the vast majority of systems are empty. the reason for this is simple. you can make more isk running level 4 missions in empire than doing anything in 90% of 0.0. exploration simply moved some plexes from being completely static (a few static complexes essentially remain). the vast majority of 0.0 is unused, because it's worthless space.whatever the solutions to this, it should not be tied solely to stations and outposts. there should be a mechanism to improve the quality of a system through sovereignty, and it shouldn't require the investment of dropping an outpost, at least to start out. this is important if we are to encourage non-space holding corporations and alliances to venture forth to 0.0, which is a worthwhile goal. the aim should be to improve 0.0 for all players, not just those alliances that currently hold stations and outposts."
12/30/2008,"a lot of these proposals have been doing the rounds through the community in various forms for a while now and they're not bad but not perfect solutions either but then when will we ever find a perfect solution.0.0 for average corp members isn't all that **** hot compared to running lvl 4 missions. for corps and alliances ofc its a different story what with high end moons. this may filter down to the members in different ways but will never have the obvious appeal of money directly in your wallet. problem with making ratting or mining better is that you make ships relatively cheaper which messes up your pvp risk/reward ratio. losing a ship should still hurt after all. boost 0.0 too much and it becomes that much easier to make up the isk for even a dread. i don't particularly think that this is needed. the sov claiming pos at the planets is not a bad idea so long as the pos at moons can still be armed to the same standard as they are now, so they can be used for staging pos. otherwise every planet would have a pos and attacking anywhere would be next to impossible so no one attacks anyone ever again and ccp shuts down the servers. best way to do it in my opinion would probably be to differentiate between station sov and industrial sov. use pos to determine industrial sov in non station systems and use the station to determine sov in station systems. 0.0 was far more dynamic when we were fighting over stations to take the actual space instead of waiting for reinforced timers bored out of our **** on both sides of the fight. arm the station ofc and up the hp so that we need to use dreads to do the job. dreads still need to have their role.one side takes the station, the other side takes it back and on and on we went till someone either ran out of ships or will to fight over that station anymore. far better than sitting waiting for timers and repping crews and all that boring ****e. just get your fleet and go take the station, make the other side stop you. hell even timezone ping pong like bkg long long ago produced a pretty epic battle for that system."
12/30/2008,what ever happened to the idea of pos fuel pellets which can be produced from the pos fuel components and then transported and fed to the pos in single 1-hour/1-day/1-week units?
12/30/2008,0.0 definitely could use a boost and i think everyone's pretty sick of pos warfare as it exists today. +1
12/30/2008,"approving this topic.don't listen to yaay, he has no idea what he's talking about and dies in stupid ways everyday.moon mining pos need a huge nerf, planetary pos idea is pretty good considering there is no better idea for a 100% decoupling of sov from pos. planetary pos also need a boost as even with pos gunners it's pretty much impossible to do anything to a decent sized attacking fleet.more changes i see that are good:jump bridge should be limited to moon pos so that they are vulnerable to smaller roaming gangs.no jump bridges in same system as cyno jammer.dds don't work in same system as cyno jammer.un****ting the rest of 0.0: true-sec means something (npc space isn't the only place with 3x 1.7m spawns anymore pls)in fact, completely remove belt rats from player owned constellation sov space. more exploration encounters should be there.introduce advanced exploration and consutrction to build or find new static belts, systems within systems (basically making a new system by exploration). exploration yields veins of t2 production stuff, etc. there's tons of stuff you can do to uncrap 0.0. and it needs it badly."
12/30/2008,"i also really like the idea of having npcs go to player owned sov4 space.have a way of making alliance lp or something (every time alliance member does mission for such and such npcs alliance gets a small amount of lp) and you can have alliance lp store where alliance executor can buy things like agents and place them in alliance owned stations.just another way of ""upgrading"" space.there needs to be a way of allowing players to add static content to systems. this is the biggest thing to uncraping 0.0. the outposts were the first major step in this. it's now been 3 years since something as major was added to the game. there has been nothing of real substance added to eve since 2005."
12/30/2008,i too am supporting this
12/30/2008,"first of all i will say that i am not trying to bash any one ,but it is hard to listen to idea's on how to improve 0.0 space when it is being pushed by a coalition that own's half of 0.0. secondly , i found a lot of the posts talking about the fact that most people are staying in empire. it is my opinion that it is pretty much impossible to move out to 0.0 without either becoming a renter for a coalition or joining a coalition. the day's of lone alliances seemed to be long passed. if alliances could hold a couple systems without getting smashed by the big guys, then the rewards would be greater then the risks.and about getting rid of local. i think that would kill ratting and mining in 0.0, who would put an expensive ship in a situation where it is defenseless and can be killed without notice. it would just push more people back into empire"

12/30/2008,supporting this!
12/30/2008,i would reactivate 2 accounts if 0.0 gets an overhaul!
12/30/2008,i too am supporting this glorious ideas.
12/30/2008,"i support the idea of sovereignty being moved from moons to planets. i also have an idea about how to bring planets into the game and make 0.0 both more lucrative and more interesting:1. as proposed sovereignty should be based on pos's anchored at planets not moons.2. planets should have attributes such as a population, resources and facilities. based on these the planet will produce certain goods. population can be increased (up to a certain level) by adding colonists/refugees etc. facilities can be built by the corporation owning the planetary pos.3. population and facilities should be vulnerable to attack via planetary bombardment. ships should be provided with the ability to orbit a planet and bombard the planet, reducing the population and damaging facilities. perhaps only dreads or battleships should have this ability.3. to provide sovereignty the planet must be provided with certain goods it requires, which will depend on the population, resources and facilities. for example a planet may produce excess planetary vehicles but need to import food. only if the import requirements are met will sovereignty be provided.4. the import and export of goods from a planet is via npc convoys. these convoys are not controlled by players and will travel between the planet and the planet's pos at random times, taking goods produced by the planet to the pos and imported goods from the pos to the planet. these convoys will be vulnerable to attack and hence will provide rich targets for roaming gangs and warrant protection from the pos owners.this is not a fully developed idea so i would welcome any comments on how it can be improved."
12/30/2008,"while i support general idea to make 0.0 less stagnant, i do not think making rats better would help anyone. there should be something else to gain for combat pilots. exploration is nice but for larger number of people there's just simply not enough of sites per region. in my opinion making income just by killing npc's shouldn't be first solution to anyone at first place. i'm a combat pilot but i surely don't make much isk by systematically killing npc's, it should be something 3 month old newbie does. also npc's should be much more intelligent.on the other hand separating moon mining from sovereignity claims is a great idea im hoping it will come in game soon. however i don't think it will solve the problem easily claiming large areas, since it's all about who can get biggest blob and just simply crush anyone. that's why we basically have so few player ""factions"" atm anyway. while being realistic in some way it doesn't explain so easy logistics part.i'll be supporting general idea though. :/"
12/30/2008,how about moving sovereignty from alliances to corporations. this should provide for more fragmented 0.0 politics. decentralisation of power away from large alliances should encourage a more dymanic 0.0 environment.
12/30/2008,"if that was the ""flogging the dead horse"" proposal i believe it's been on the agenda. it was already voted up i just don't recall if we've already discussed that particular item or if it's on the agenda for iceland instead."

12/30/2008,"the problem i have is that this doesn't address the issues of 0.0, it's merely brushing over them. people don't fight in 0.0 because it's a huge time sink, not a huge financial sink. nobody want's to go shoot station services because it serves no purpose for the considerable time and resources needed. nobody wants to hammer pos because you can restront them and force siege after siege strictly due to timezone warfare. not to mention the time required to off line guns and mods ahead of time or risk losing dreads or debilitating your fleet in fights. task are unachievable and all that results is global wars that end in stalemates. smaller players either tag along or die trying to solo. fight numbers are out of control as a result.removing massive stuctures completely, and removing rediculous hps on objects will be far more productive than any ""incentive"" for coming to 0.0. make people fight more to where wars are realistic, and you'll see a boom in 0.0."
12/30/2008,your main points deal with pos warfare and how ******ed it is...fix or take awy that mechanic--decouple sov--and many of the boring parts get minimized or eliminated.
12/30/2008,"i must admit that i've had 3 accounts up till now. if i was short of funds, i'd let one account slide but at least he was still training. it's only one level ffs, it wasn't as if we could queue up several skills to train one after the other. a month later when i got paid, i would pay his account again but only one of my accounts (my main) has skills that would take over a month to train at the moment so i would still lose training time. most of us use all of our accounts and having one not active is actually a set-back. i don;t know how ccp came to the conclusion that it aids farming characters, especially now that we can only buy 60 day gtc's now and not 30 day.either they introduce a queue or they re-instate ghost training since one would negate the possibility of the other. it seems like ccp want it both ways and if that's the case, i'll be looking for another game to play. i know ccp has it's current financial problems, we all do with the recession at the moment but taking ghost training away from players is not going to force them to spend money they haven't got.i've started to get into taikodom now and it looks to be quite good once it's past beta. playing it for free right now but if i quit eve, i'll have the resources to pay for it and get the good stuff.most of my old friends from eve have quit now, i really starting to think it's time i moved on as well and this, along with the onslaught of nerfs recently, is beginning to make me feel more serious about it. the only reason i have stayed is because i have invested a lot of time in my characters so it would be a shame to biomass them but it's a game and if i feel that i can no longer play it because of recent changes, i'll go ahead and do it."

12/30/2008,probably is a good idea to make a combat booster which increase torpedoes speed.. for slot 2.. like frentix booster increase optimal range.
12/30/2008,missiles should be simply invulnerable to smartbombs and some of the slower missiles should have increased hp against i.e. defender missiles.

12/30/2008,thank god
12/30/2008,"wow. just, wow.without going into the ""lag/no lag"" argument, you're all missing one particular point. you don't know if it will cause lag or not! sure, you can give your opinion, but in the end, without testing it, you can't say for certain how it will affect the server.i think it's a nice idea, in theory, however, i'm personally happy with the look of the ships themselves. i would much rather see the name of my ship on the side while flying, which (if lag is, in fact an issue) would be much easier on the whole system, as you'd only have to deal with font and colour choices.sorry, but i'm opting out on this one at this time."
12/30/2008,"while you are right that you could ""argue"" that ships are already being painted, there's a large difference.the point being that loading more data from the database will cause a higher load per transaction. while you might argue that one extra field from a row is not a ""huge"" amount of data, it's still data which has to be queried from the database.also, if i'm not mistaken, i seem to remember that painting of ships was a feature back in beta, but was pulled out due to performance reasons?"
12/30/2008,"jita used to have performance issues, too. ccp's developers have learned a lot over the years. their hardware and software both have improved dramatically. i'd love to spend a few weeks with those guys to pick up some of their tricks.honestly, a few extra bytes per player is miniscule amounts of data - we're already loading ship type, player location, name, security status, vector, module status (for animations of shield boosters, armor reppers), guns, etc. and eve runs just fine. honestly, given the size of some of the places i've been, i find it to be quite amazing.i think that some of the people here are being a little over-reactive. the only downside that i see is that, right now, it would be possible to paint a cruiser to look like a hac counterpart. but, if it can be turned off, then it isn't a problem.an alternate solution would to have a majority of the ship's color be static, with the option to change the color of smaller parts of the ship. some stripes or bands. or, put your coporation's logo up there... but let's not get too crazy. (o;just so that the op knows, people have been requesting this feature for a long time. i'm not sure that it will ever be implemented, but it would be nifty to have an official ""yes"" or a ""no, and here's why"" response. i've found that the eve community as a whole is very cool with a ""no"" response, as long as we get an explanation.edit: forgot to check the support button.

12/30/2008,there is a major difference between 100ms and 500msjust play halo for a bit and you'll catch on real quick. (yes i know eve is not a fps but the point is valid in any case for connectivity)but regardless.... i'm still for this.
12/30/2008,"once the game is able to support large scale fights without having to zoom out a long distance so you see nothing and totally use the overview to get any performance at all then fine... throw a little cosmetic work onto the fire. otherwise, i would suggest taking a screenshot and use photoshop or something to satisfy your cravings."

12/30/2008,"against!nano ship weren't invulnerable and the ppl complaining about nano's just weren't thinking tactically enough to fight effectively against them. i ran in nothing but nano gangs for 2 years and just for a change of pace we set up anti nano gangs to totally pwn any nano gang we came across. if the skill and mods were too expensive, then get out and make the isk to buy them then. join an alliance that can help you out, dont b***h and ruin the game for the people who have been playing for years and built up their wallets to be able to enjoy flying nano ships. i bet a majority of the people who are complaining are casual eve players who wont be around in two months. then all that will be left are the people like myself who have been playing for years. the ones who have spent lots of isk and countless hours to enjoy this type of gameplay. <---where did my alliance ticker go?"
12/30/2008,"it can suck to be punished for breakings the rules when you don't know what the rules are.granted, i don't see this as ever being a problem for a majority of people, but even so - having exploits be common knowledge is a good thing.let me bring in an example from my own past experiences.i used to be the server administrator for a sizable half-life based gaming group, 50+ players. we ran tfc, cs, and natural selection servers, plus one or two random obscure mods that i would switch around every few weeks. very popular servers, almost always full, so we would get every type of player.all long time members of the group had the ability to kick and ban players that broke the rules. one of the rules was, obviously, no cheating / exploiting bugs / using 1337 h4x.the problem was that a lot of my guys weren't always sure if something was an exploit or not. how can you tell an aimbot from someone who is just a good shot, for example?some people would get banned because they were so good that people thought they must be cheating. other people who were cheating weren't banned, because nobody was really sure if that player was really using and exploit.so what i did is i found some of these exploits, learned how to use them, and i held an exploit training night. i showed everyone some of the exploits and, since they were able to see and experience the real thing, they were able to better identify real cheating afterwards. it was very helpful, and the number of unbanning requests on our forums dropped dramatically.having a list here in eve would serve the same purpose. i believe that having this kind of information publically available will result in less cheating overall, since people are more likely to be caught if other people know, instead of just suspect, that something is an exploit. it will also help prevent people from unknowingly using an exploit, when they really think they're just being clever."
12/30/2008,"i'm all for this idea.that said, this has been brought up multiple times and it won't happen as the ambiguity allows the gm's to be carefree with their warnings and bans / responses to petitions. let's not forget that the ""player guide"" was also supposedly written by a third party and contains entries that ccp themselves didn't know were there. that cannot be taken as the bible of what is allowed either."
12/30/2008,"i don't find his questioning twisted at all. in many cases, within business at least, it is common not to list offenses at the micro level because doing so can lead to the defense that the item you committed was not listed as bad and is therefore good. in many cases i agree though in this one i think there's a middle ground.i do see it as pretty much a gigantic waste of time for ccp to be trying to compile every possible potential exploit. i also see however that there are times when periodic announcements of specific exploits are made. i believe what could work in this scenario would be for them to organize all those in one place so that a list is formed of all announced exploits, and updated if it's suddenly declared not an exploit. this would provide both clarity and accountability. they could also provide instructions near the exploit in question on how to report it.cynoing inside of pos shields is one example that's flip-flopped and still occurs. pos bowling being another.if what i've stated above meshes with the intent of the op i'd be happy to sponsor such an item."
12/30/2008,"hello all,i'll admit that my first attempt was pretty hideous, but after getting ideas from divad and tchell in my first thread, i've formulated this modified idea. as with my other ideas, this one is continually able to be improved upon, and i welcome your constructive criticism.the containers in the game of eve do not serve the function they were originally designed for. it's obvious that they were not designed for 'saddlebagging', where they enlarge the size of the cargohold of a ship. their use as a stashing area for ore during mining, while it may have been effective when the game was first released, and is currently almost useless with the yield of a mining barge or exhumer.while i believe that larger containers themselves would be counterproductive to the game, there is an option for a new type of container. this container would not be able to be used while in a cargohold or station, but only when deployed in space during mining operations.these one-use containers should cost about 10,000 isk and take up 500 m3 while unassembled (similar to the way the pos structures or ships take up far less space when unassembled, and able to fit inside a properly-equipped astrometric frigate). they would be weaker than a standard container, with less hitpoints, and would only exist in space for 3 hours.the container would fit up to 8,000 m3 (less than a third of what a jetcan holds) and would take 120 seconds to assemble or disassemble in space, as well as anchoring and password protecting it. it could be accessed by any hauler to remove the ore (with the appropriate password, of course). it would not take any roles to deploy, but the anchoring skill (level 1) would be required to anchor and password protect it. as with all deployables, the container would not be able to be anchored in 0.8 or higher security systems, but could still be deployed (without the password).to counteract the obvious benefits of this can, the password would be hackable (using the hacking skill and the codebreaker module) to gain access to the container. however, whether successful or failed, the owner and his gang would immediately have the standard 15 minutes to destroy the hacker after the result of the check is known. the hacker can continue to hack if he was initially unsuccessful, but at a great risk to himself. this makes the can a target with some consequences.comments? questions?edit: removed the small bit at the end that seemed to be aggravating a lot of posters."
12/30/2008,"yes, just one - stop posting stupid ideas ""how to boost miners"". mining is already to easy."
12/30/2008,"you, sir, fail at reading comprehension. hackable gscs make mining easier? how?this boosts piracy a lot while making mining more directly pvp. as it stands, mining is just a race to mine the ore into your hauler or gsc before the other guy. now a new twist is possible.as it stands, only certain exploration areas have any use for the hacking skill. properly balanced success/failure ratios and hackable gscs would greatly improve the use of this skill. you'd have the increased risk of your pirate ship as you sit there hacking away while the can owner can go fetch a pvp fit ship. on the other side, you cannot use these cans to just dump stuff in space, hiding it from corpmates. they can go hack your can.many a starter player has asked why they cannot use the codebreaker on a player canister. this would align the effect of hacking and the codebreaker with the expected function - hacking into cans."
12/30/2008,"he want to increase capacity by 250% and reduce needed space when packaged to 16% of old gsc. thats why. and even if you wont hack it, you are flagged for trying. op want god mode for (macro)miners.to be honest all gsc should be hackable without agroo. just go to belts in 0.5 systems. more of them are full of gsc flying in thousands of spots near rocks, which prooves that mining to gsc is already to profitable.hulks, mackinaws already have big cargo, and if its full, just warp to station or take friend with industrial/transport ship."
12/30/2008,"thievery should still be a profession in high sec. the war against macro miners deserves to be called a war. war against can flippers? please, your bias is showing and frankly it's embarrassing.edit: i'll elaborate on my position. secure containers, hackable or not, need to be much much smaller than completely non-secure jetcans. no matter how you paint it, this proposal increases the efficiency and decreases the risk of solo mining."
12/30/2008,"no not bothering with a reason, plenty already given above, below and in the last thread...."
12/30/2008,"containers that can be hacked are an awesome idea. i love such things, because it removes absolute decisions, filling in grey. in addition, it should still be possible to scoop the whole container. anchored or not. that way, thiefs would have more options, yet also more limitations. security would increase in one area, yet decrease in another. diversity makes the game more thrilling.and people could make a fortune going through 'claimed' highsec belts, littered with anchored containers and hack the crap out of them. hehe... sounds like fun."
12/30/2008,"tbh, looking at our industrial corp, that matter was addressed with the orca imho."
12/30/2008,"no for can mining. mining ships have laughable space for minerals though, also clicking rock once per every few minutes is pretty dumb."
12/30/2008,please see orca.... do not want
12/30/2008,"i've done both. mining and stealing.answer to your problem? use your brain with what's already on the table. lots of mining 'teams' don't seem to understand how to mine even with a hauler. the ability to securely use a gsc as a pass-through mechanism seems to go beyond them, they still insist on using non-secure jetcans with a bookmark/single piece of ammo in them. ... and yet, ore theives are lame. mining doesn't need a boost at all. it's one of the easiest, if not the easiest profession in the game - the orca has just made it even easier in a long line of 'making mining easier' exercises.t2 mining lasers, strips, crystals, barges, exhumers, roq, orca and high sec ice... it's almost the most dull thing in any game. ore thieves add an element of risk to the reward of mining in jetcans - and make the miners have to work a little harder. if anything, an element of skill needs to be introduced to mining to create decent yields.oh and not supported. again. just in case you were in any doubt."
12/30/2008,absolutely!

12/30/2008,right now in 0.0.. the likeliness of being podded is very high. meaning people dont wear those +5 implants for learning.this is a fairly large disadvantage relative to those in empire.i think there should be a way of essentially salvaging the corpses for implants; or simply adjust the lp stores to make learning implants significantly cheaper; or some other system that would inject lots of implants into the system and bring them down and down in price.
12/30/2008,"that's why there's jump clones. although you have relative security if you're deep in your alliance's space, people often jump clone to 0.0 for whatever they want, the jc back for training.risk and reward."
12/30/2008,this. though the notion of salvaging something from corpses is an intruging notion.

12/30/2008,"issue : speedtanking plexesconcern : unfair balance for different factions.there is a serious gameplay imbalance in the plex capture game mechanic for faction warfare. specifically for the amarr vs. minmatar division. i can not speak for the gallente or caldari sides.the major imbalance is that a solo minmatar player can solo and speed tank the npcs in an amarrian plex with a t1 frigate. meanwhile, and amarrian militia pilot capturing a minmatar plex requires 2 pilots minimum, and tech 2 equipment.cause?the cause has to do with the npcs. let's review what the different npcs get for electronic warfare?amarrian -tracking disruptorsminmatar -stasis webifierstarget paintersenergy neutralizers on some battleshipsi think it should be pretty obvious the cause. with target painters, webifiers and energy neutralizers, the minmatar npcs have a serious advantage against the smaller ships. the amarrian ew effects are limited and weak, and tracking disruption does not affect speed tanking.it has become common practice amongst minmatar militia to go into an amarrian plex and speedtank the plex with a vigil orbiting the timer. this is all but impossible for amarrian militia members.not to mention, these major plexes should be team efforts, and not solo efforts.-possible solutions?-- give amarr npcs energy neutralization!! it's what we do!-- give amarr npcs stasis webifiers. not only the minmatar use this technology.-- consider alternate npc types like turrets which are easily destroyed by a team, but can be difficult for solo players to remove.-- other suggestions?"
12/30/2008,"i agree there does seem to be a lack of balance when a couple of t1 frigates can take an amarr unrestricted complex and it takes a fleet to take a minmatar medium complex.the solution for my 0.02 isk is to remove speed tanking as a viable tactic. it should not be possible to take a complex without destroying the npcs in the first place so this is a tactic that makes no real sense.fit the timer structures with those long range stasis webification batteries that we see in some mission sites, the ones with a range of 100km+. do it to both sides by all means, i'm not looking for any kind of favouritism.oh yeah, and introduce interceptor frigates with mwd and warp scramblers. make it a bit more challenging rather than the current option to just warp out and rep up every time then return."
12/30/2008,/signedespecially since qr speedtanking increased massivly. i estimate about 90-95% of all offensive minmatar vp are aquired by people solo speedtanking all kind of plexesthe solution is simple:it should not be possible to cap a plex without killing all of the npcsforce people to fight for the plexes if they really want them
12/30/2008,it is rather silly that a complex can be captured without killing off all the rats.
12/30/2008,/signedespecially nephilim's request on fighting npcs inside.
12/30/2008,"/signedi thought fw was about fighting, not outrunning every shot coming toward you.i agree with nephilim as well. if you want the plex, you should fight for every single one of them. this is war we're having here, not a bloody marathon!"
12/30/2008,"i think the whole plexing mechanic is stupid, but the problem is that only a few people are interested in the plexes at all, and you need loads and loads of them to render a system vulnerable. if plexes cannot be captured by individuals or duo teams, then i don't think we'll ever see a vulnerable system again, simply because offensive fleets can't get enough plexes to get a system to vulnerable state. of course this has to do with the amount of plexes needed and the ******ed spawning system behind it.that and defensive plexing gets the contested level down way too easy and way too fast (and gives more standing too!!!)as far as i know solo-speedtanking the caldari in the major plexes is not possible, they have energy neuts, so you need an interceptor orbiting at 100km or something while someone else is at the beacon."
12/30/2008,"i agree with many things you said.my main point is still to at least balance the current system so that minmatar don't have a total solo advantage. amarr needs duo teams, and that's at least tolerable until something broader is improved. the solution would be somewhat simple as well, just adjust it so that a speedtanker cant sit on the timer. amarrian speedtankers have to fly out to 100-150km to capture, and we need support on the timer.a minmatar pilot can just speedtank right on the timer."
12/30/2008,"well documented error in judgement when allowing mwd's to function inside complexes. ai is appalling to begin with, which is why mission runners had their mwd removed to prevent the easy kiting.removing the mwd option from plexes is not an option for fw as it would impose too severe limits on options so alternatives should be sought. multiple possible solutions have been put forward, the ones gaining most traction are:solution#1: add bad-ass neutralizing ships to shut down mwdscomment:would hurt ""legitimate"" tanking/killing plexing ships more than speed tankers though.solution#2: add uber-speed frigates to intercept the speeders.comment: missiles rip the speedier frigate npcs apart as it is, wouldn't solve the issue.solution#3 (my favourite): require destruction of all (or major part) npcs for capture to be possible.comment: it's npcs .. how hard can it be. simplest solution that addresses the issue at hand."
12/30/2008,"the suggestions given by sergeant vouja are sound and reasonable.the purpose of csm is to maintain a balance within the parameters of the empire, as the engineers improve on various attributes.i hope csm will take this matter into serious consideration."
12/30/2008,thumb down. a player has to mount a module to obtain the effect. so it is only fair that a player should have to mount a module or be piloting a ship with advanced sensors to obtain that info.
12/30/2008,why not? this is a bloody hard thing to implement. while we all like the idea of smaller ships being smashed to pieces on huge asteriods and titans if they hit them fast enough its going to be a huge undertaking for the programmers. that kind of think might just happen if you ditched the idea of laptops and non cable connections.
12/30/2008,lol - since when have the laws of physics mattered in the eve universe
12/30/2008,"this is the most sensible recommendation that i have heard about the insurance system - ever.it makes quite a lot of sense for an insurance company to give me a low premium if i rarely lose my ship. if i get blown up a lot, it only makes sense that my premiums would skyrocket - if the company would bother to insure me at all! it is like surviving three heart attacks, a stroke, getting your kidneys removed, plus some brain surgery to remove that malignant tumor, then going to apply for some life insurance.i also like the recommendation that the insurance payout changes based on circumstances, such as the security status of the system. as far as i am concerned, it would only make sense that an insurance company would have exceptions to the insurance contract. if you willingly put yourself in a bad situation, then it is your fault, and you may not be compensated."

12/30/2008,"dear sirs and madams,i would like to propose the idea that wars are currently too easy to avoid, especially if you have lots of isk/are happy to buy isk (all be it via gtc's another [issue]?).being in a corp which frequently decs large wealthy targets in order to extort cash (this is eve after all), it is quite common for people to simply setup an alliance in order to make it more expensive to carry on with the war. is this not an exploit? is it intended that the cost of deccing one corp should be 2 mill or 50 mill per week?while i would not go so far as to suggest that people be banned from joining/setting up alliances while at war there should be some form of balance, one idea being to allow the deccing corp to carry on deccing the alliance at the original corp war cost."
12/30/2008,there ya go. fixed to reflect the majority of war-decs in eve.
12/30/2008,"indeed this behavior does sound like a heinous exploit; it's almost as bad as beating you in combat or staying docked to avoid battles, and the problem is exacerbated by the fact that establishing an alliance is totally free."
12/30/2008,there was an announcement made that stated joining an alliance to dodge the wardec was indeed an exploit.don't think it mentioned anything about creating one being an exploit.
12/30/2008,"i recall that joining an alliance and promptly leaving, thereby foisting the war on the alliance, was declared an exploit. i would imagine that joining an alliance to get more people on your side is a valid tactic."

12/30/2008,"repping sieged dreads is a horrible idea. repping other triaged ships is even worse.triage is used all the time in pos warfare, i see nothing wrong with it as is."
12/30/2008,i have an alternate suggestion:stop reimbursements altogether.
12/30/2008,"to this......and this......i really have to ask you both the same question.if it's possible to hack the client (which i'm not saying it's not - anything is achievable) who's to say it's not occurring right now?to hesod. there are many options (which herschel touched on) which would essentially 'encrypt' the information being sent to ccp, or it could even be built it into the client, (as is done in products such as ""microsoft windows"") but yes, you are right - anything can be hacked.that being said, i would tend to say that if this level of hacking was available, who's to say it's not already being done? i would tend to lean towards the fact that people would hack the system to get buttloads of isk, or to place ships/items into their hangars/cargoholds, rather than go looking to modify the client to replace their ships lost in combat.i think we've got a good discussion going, and i don't want to abandon the idea in its entirety. there is, of course, always balance to any idea, so if the idea itself is to post a ""rule book"" for petitions, so that there's balance and fairness, then that's the way to go."
12/30/2008,"hacking the client won't give you more isk, ships, items, etc. all of those transactions occur server-side. the client simply sends requests like ""i would like to buy this item"", and the system takes care of ensuring you have the money, putting the item in the right place, etc.the most a hacked client could do would be to display an incorrect amount of isk, for example. but, since it wouldn't actually exist on the server side, it doesn't matter.the eve client is a glorified dumb terminal. all it does is send requests to the server, where all of the real work is done, and display the results back to you.second, encrypting some sort of log data will not stop someone who really wants to break the system. these kinds of things are easy to do. the encryption key will be in memory - it has to be in order to be used - so that is easy enough to copy. remember when the hd dvd and bluray people were claiming, ""zomg!11 our drm is teh win, nevar wil it be brokin!!!"" well, it was. it didn't take long either.the encryption algorithm would either be one of the mainstream ones (which makes life easy enough), or the process can be stepped through and inspected while it executes. sure, it takes longer to figure out, but it can be done.the log data could be obsfucated, but it is easy to figure out the meaning of the data. you can generate the same actions over and over, which would produce the same log information. you just match the data to the actions.again, that takes more time, but it can be done. all it takes it for one person to figure out how, and then everyone will be able to do it. or, at least, everyone in a particular person's alliance.it is an old line in the it world, but it is true. ""security through obscurity"" doesn't work. i know that we're just talking about a game here, but there's a lot of smart kids out there with more than enough free time on their hands to piece things together, if for no other reason than to prove that it can be done and to satisfy their own egos. ""look at me, i'm the one that released the eve log hack!"""
12/30/2008,"naturally it's being hacked now. but because all the important calculations are done on the server, the hacks can't do anything beyond botting.securing the data as it travels to ccp is easy. ensuring that the data is correct before it gets encrypted is the problem.because hacking the client doesn't give any advantage, unless you want to use bots.all those examples would require hacking the server because the server, not the client. that is much harder as ccp has physical access to it, not the attacker. all the attacker has is an internet connection to the server.it sounds like ccp already has a rulebook for petitions. check the logs, if they don't show a problem then the petition must be refused. and given that players will lie when it is to their advantage*, i can't see any other option.i have lost stuff do to bugs before and received ""the logs show nothing"" as the response.*if you don't believe this, go watch the c&p forum for a few days."
12/30/2008,"you misunderstand me. the client can be hacked by someone with patience, because they have unlimited access to it. if they wanted to go in and flip bits in order to make it do exactly what they wanted it to, they could. they have no even remotely comparable level of access to the server code, and thus they can't just go adding things to the database. as for why it isn't happening already, the reason is simple - there's no real advantage to be gained. the client is a dumb terminal - it stores no data except for user settings, and it makes no decisions. this is intentional, specifically to prevent hacking. you could, theoretically, hack it to make a new graphics engine or a better ui, but that's not worth the effort even for the bored. and even then, it'd have no effect on ccp. the only thing you can really do that'd hurt the game is hack the logserver to generate a false bug report, but that'd be pointless and stupid. if, however, there was a concrete advantage to be gained, don't doubt that somebody would work to gain it. it might be an utter waste of time compared to just going out and ratting, but remember that mcdonald's pays 150 million an hour and people still mine in highsec. a rulebook isn't a terrible idea, though i'd ask whether one exists before i went clamouring for them to add one."
12/30/2008,"good idea. the doomsday argh run scared ...""the horror"" should vaporise all but the most massive of ships. if you are looking to salvage from a wreck you need to kill gently."
12/30/2008,an easy way to do this is to have a after effect of radiation.where most larger ships could tank it... but anything smallish should likely leave the area or get fried in the process.wrecks would expire after a couple seconds or something.

12/30/2008,"how about this, hersch: use my idea above, but give them massive power grid and cap usage. you might be able to fit and run 5 on a dual cap boosted bs. and them make them stack like webs. it wouldn't be overpowered (they'd stop working at 1km just like normal tractor beams), so if a frig pilot was comfortable flying at that distance, then there's nothing much lost. also, any frig should be able to outrun any tractor effect (let's say larges pull frigs at 300m/s), which means that unless the bs also webs the frig, it's not much worthwhile. and hell, give them a 12km range so inties aren't much effected. as to frig rag dolls... the only way this would really happen is if you had three bss with tractors all spread out and all pulling the same frig. but even so, the vectors would more or less cancel out and even though the frig would be bobbing around, his normal speed would be more or less maintained unless one side had a much stronger pull (i.e., three beams) than the other--in which case, there wouldn't really be a change in the way they were supposed to function. add to that the fact that if three bss were fitting smartbombs instead of tractors, the frigs would stand an even worse chance of survival. implementation of this idea would also be interesting in that it might give life to quad tractoring disco geddons. they wouldn't be very useful, but they would be fun (and hey, they would work as a drone killer--> drag drones off the target then smartbomb their asses). in short, i really don't see the problem here. especially since the qr update; there should probably be at least one moderately ineffective bs sized mod added to help counter a 4-man frig gang."

12/31/2008,"moving pos to planets isn't fixing the problem, it's just moving the problem."
12/31/2008,"its mitigating the problem and perhaps tweaking it to be less of one. until pos or their equivalent are totally decoupled from sov claims--necessitating a better mechanic to be devised--at the very least this gets the ball rolling, and it possibly opens the door to that long-promised option of planet coloniziation and use."
12/31/2008,"nobody yet has said how this solution works for the better, all they say is that it'll work. moving sov holding to planets doesn't fix anything, it probably actually makes it worse. less planets means more control over a system b/c it's easier to cover all planets. same reason low moon count systems are so nice to have. total moon control now makes life hell on the attacker. how will planets fix that very problem?add onto that the call for more defense of these planetary sturctures and you get a double wammy. 0.0 doesn't need more defensive structures, it needs less. moving things to planets is only making more of less.everyone's supporting something and refusing to look at it's flaws."
12/31/2008,"no, we have said multiple times that the current problems with pos warfare stem from the fact that there are too many pos that people have to deal with in order to take sovereignty. this manifets in two manners.1. high numbers of timers mean that organizations can manipulate timers more easily to avoid fights. rather than coming for a single fight at an off time, an attacker needs to maintain a presence over a large swath of off time.2. high number of pos mean that purging a system takes a lot longer than is necessary. after the system has been taken and there are still 5-10 enemy pos sitting around that need to be destroyed each one has to be reinforced, and killed at a later time. when there is no fight over these pos as there often isn't as the system has already been lost it becomes a simple boring repetition to knock them all down.moving pos to planets fixes that problem by moving pos from a high count area to a low count area. moving pos to a single point of contention might make control too binary[i.e. 1 or 2 points] though i am sure that it is on the table. either way, its pretty impossible to say that such a system would be bad for the game since there is a fairly agreed upon problem of too many pos to shoot down.re: ""goons just want to save their systems"". if the above system had been implemented before the last number of fights, it is unlikely that we would have held more ground that we currently do."

12/31/2008,"you seem to not get it, i want them on planets too, but that's not the only fix. darius and worthless band of 10% elected co want to buff up thier defenses on planets, i'm saying remove more and more defenses. darius is saying 0.0 is worthles, i'm saying it's already too vauable. this game already has way to many isk faucets, we dont' need more.there's 1 small good fix coupled with about 30 bad ones in their proposal.i don't think anyone feels they need to stay on moons, i'm saying it's not enough to just throw them on planets.removing all the bad in the current system is the first step to restoring 0.0 to what it should be. smaller escalations building to larger ones. right now it's bring everyone, bring the kitchen sink, bring santa, and everyone pray to god that he'll come to. and if mom's done baking, give her a computer so she can play on our side."

12/31/2008,"i think you're the one missing the point.sov mechanics need to be revisited and revised to something not resembling an abortion. however, barring that, something should be done in an attempt to patch/fix/make it less dumb. gutting the system without a good plan to replace it is a bit rash, however. a simple, iterative move would be to shift to planets and then maybe throw in additional tweaks. hell, the planets thing is just a suggestion in and of itself--the point is to get the ball rolling and to throw some ideas at ccp who have ultimate control over any changes. the whole 'advisory council' concept, i know.blobbing will always be part of 0.0. this is human nature and cannot be changed; you can just make it less required to bring them, but as someone mentioned: if you can do the job in 10 minutes with 30 people, someone will prefer to do it in 30s with a fleet of 150.as for 0.0 being too rich....only certain regions may qualify. vast majority of 0.0 is no better than lowsec."
12/31/2008,supporting this
12/31/2008,"you seem to be ignoring what i'm saying. perhaps i haven't been clear every time i've been crystal clear including in the op. i've tried to avoid specifics, but the fact is that examples need to be given in order to help people understand what the desired end result could look like. the unfortunate part of that, and why i've tried to avoid it, is that people such as yourself will not be able to see beyond the examples. i've already said that i agree with you in many ways regarding space needing fewer defenses as opposed to more. what i don't get, because it simply isn't so, is how you can see that being able to deploy far fewer posses is a greater defense. your statement that 0.0 is too valuable is pretty patently false. if it was so valuable people would be stepping all over each other to get a piece. at least in theory.as far as 1 good fix in 30 proposed... i haven't proposed 30 fixes. the base of my proposal can be best summed up as ""minimize the number of posses in play and separate their roles on the way to removing them entirely as a sov mechanic"" and ""buff the profitability of 0.0 as an incentive, but don't just buff it make people work for it and invest in the space they claim"". i count two recommendations. there are a number of specific examples there, but those are merely examples of how a system could be architected to provide clarity. nothing more. at the end of the day i could care less how it is implemented provided the theory is answered.the problem isn't necessarily that the mentality is bring everyone and the kitchen sink... this is an mmo. that's what happens. it's natural. the problem is the vast amount of tedium involved, the ability to abuse that tedium to avoid conflict and the lack of bang for the tedium's buck. i don't disagree with you that 0.0 needs a complete revamp, but, as i've said at least twice now, i don't see that happening in the near term. what we can do is provide some thoughts on how we can transition in that direction. the first step in completely removing posses would be to phase them out a bit and alter their roles. that is what's specifically requested in this proposal."
12/31/2008,"perfect example, 00yz. smaller pos counts mean systems are harder to take. goons/ra and co had how man attempts to take that system w/o any real chance when we had total moon control.less defenses in system means more smaller scale warfare which means huge nap pacts are less effective. rzr can't go help mm every time they get attacked if they can loose every indy and mining option every time they leave. they instead have to spend more time defending themselves. less defenses is the key to restricting space holding because it limits how easily you can defend vast space."
12/31/2008,resonates very well with what i came up with regarding 0.0. yay for ccp being on the money.moar ships for everyone. moar pew-pew.
12/31/2008,i fully support this. the way 0.0 works and the rewards an alliance can gain needs to be looked into and adjusted.
12/31/2008,"you'll still have the same situation with one control bunker versus 3-7 planetary towers. and at least these encourage fights, not tz pingpong like we have currently--after all if you can avoid taking on a deathstar and just outspam the other guy, why fight?again, don't try to eliminate/rule out blobbing. its not going to happen so forget it. if taking a system means enough to one side that they organize enough people to steamroll it, then they're going to do it and good job by them.the only way your statement approaches coherence is if you're trying to say that the harder it is to defend any given system, the less spread out you'll want to be so you are able to defend it all. however at that point, the real qualifier would be: how hard is it to take that defense point/tower/whatever? what is the appropriate force to use--a 20 man hac gang? 200 battleships? 30 dreads?where is the line drawn, and how do you determine it? in case you're not seeing the point, i'm trying to illustrate a basic balance quandary: making it tough enough where if you sleep or are weak in a tz you won't lose sov, but at the same time making it ""easy"" enough to be a concern when dealing with a large spread out area. its very difficult to do.this may be the ultimate result of the sov system revisioning, but there are other ways they can go that may be more interesting/fun--planet colony control, etc. edit: and if you are trying to say that the notion of losing all your industrial/system improvements is a distinct and viable possibility every time you blink, go to bed, or jump out of system...just no. that would not be a fun game."
12/31/2008,sounds good
12/31/2008,"tz ping-pong. good description.how about coupling the tz ping-pong with a mechanic that opens up a large area of vulnerability instead of just one point? e.g. if you have one tower, when it comes out of reinforced it will be the only point of contention, whereas if you own a lot of towers in a region, when one of them comes out of reinforcement, they are all points of contention.balance the attendant added headache to defenders with lower fueling/drudgery for the entire system of towers so that maintaining one isn't much easier than maintaining many. if you need space, you take it. if you don't, you don't bother with the added exposure.could also add a larger defensive advantage at a central structure that overlooks the tower network. when it goes, the whole network unanchors. in the event that nobody wants to fight, there are fewer knockdowns to weather through. even though a small alliance might not like the idea of getting steamrolled at once, they would stand a better chance at that central point of contention that at any of the satellite towers."
12/31/2008,bring back static plexes (something to fight over). remove smugglers gates (forces choke point/pipe control).and the rest of that pos crap.
12/31/2008,"come on nande, how many times do i have to tell you that multiple contention points does not work. if you have multiple attack points then the attackers can choose to attack any that they want while the defenders must choose to defend one and hole they guess right, or defend them all and guarantee a loss.no, that is a ****ty mechanic that makes for a ****ty game. no one should ""balance their game by making it more boring"". if you want to incur costs to holding space roll those costs directly into the towers and do not create grind mechanics.having a system be won or lost at a single battle is not a viable alternative to ""having a system be won or lost over 30-40 battles"". a med point is needed"
12/31/2008,"network of multiple contention points -- yeah, it makes it harder for defenders, but they already get the defensive advantage (tower defenses) and get to somewhat randomize the tz thing to their liking.the big thing that it does is makes mobility important, which adds a lot of tactical flavor. attackers and defenders have to be mobile and have to keep good intel. currently, the tz balancing mechanics completely take the fun out of giving the defender the runaround across their territory, which caters only to the well established.centralized network hub (?) -- i always vote for less management and fuel required. if the hub (maybe constellation is highest level of organization?) requires about as much fuel as a tower, then everyone is at best going to be at the current rate of boredom but will have less running around fueling to do.happy middle ground: multiple reinforcement cycles. there, you have to win at least a few. less than required to hit everything in a constellation, but more than just a fluke holiday win.happy new year<U+65B0><U+5E74><U+304A>^_^"
12/31/2008,double post
12/31/2008,"if you're not around to defend your own space, then yes, this should be the case. remember, someone has to attack you to lose these things, which means a hostile fleet out in the open ---> fights. if you're home to defend, great, fight potential. if you're an attacker, great, more ways to provoke fights. nowadays, it takes so long to nuke station services that nobody bothers b/c it's such a massive investment for so little yeild. make it easier, people are more inclined to do it repetitively to cause grief. while at the same time, forcing someone to defend their turf.less hp on structures is just as much a buff to the defenders for not having to spend countless hours of boring work just to repair things. i don't know about you, but i don't consider idling in a carrier while mods rep fun. the idea they're presenting isn't provoking fights, it's just moving the mechanics of today to a different location. it's not addressing massive nap pack blobs because people still aren't running the risk of losing space easily. it's not addressing jammer and jump bridge issues which are 2 of the biggest downfalls of sov. if i'm missing something b/c darius is refusing to tell the finer details, then sure, i'll buy into the plan.but i'm personally a skeptic of someone who refuses to put out all the cards on the table. what frightens me is that for 2 years now, being both the attacker and the victim, i've said 0.0 is borked and a massive time sink. this isn't some fotm deal. it's not enough to buy into a plan b/c parts of it are good where other parts look flat out wrong. i want a plan that works for fear of waiting another 2 years to get this fixed again after all the wasted time on the first plan."
12/31/2008,"no, it doesn't. a fight where the defenders don't show up isn't a fight. the attackers will chose one point, blob it, and lock down the system. it pretty much negates all defensive advantages and means that defenders have to find a point where they can hold all three.its dumb.no, it doesn't because mobility is largely an on-grid phenomina and not an off grid phenomena. the difference between a bs gang and inty gang unless the warps are very long is very low.to top it off, in a large mixed gang(which is what you will see) your entire mobility advantage will be negated by not being able to win a fight. this is exactly the current situation. there are a number of towers that will come out across a time period and you have to win some number of them. moving it to a central location doesn't change anything.the problem is that there are too many ""nodes of contention"".the solution is simply and does not require anything radical in terms of gameplay. whomever holds the most planets wins. shoot the things on planets. shoot them one at a time. all you have to do is reduce the number of points that people are going to be shooting at."
12/31/2008,"is this a joke? less hp on structures is a direct nerf to defenders because it makes attacking them easier. the defenses will deal less damage before they are knocked out, you need less forces in order to get the job done. etc etc etc. the repping cost is not time sensitive, does not require any ""sufficient force"" to start doing, and since there is a much larger area under which it can occur is much less dependent on structure hit points."
12/31/2008,"you're right, and every reason stated there is anti blob which is the whole point. they were designed, (i dare you to look up the old blogs) for small scale goals, not massive fleets. it is the job of a fleet to defend a system, not pos guns.as for repping, that was aimed at station mods being offlined, but either way it holds true. will they get offlined more, yes, but will you spend nearly as much time repairing any one mod, no.the big problem with pos warfare is what it has done to 0.0 warfare in general, not just the tower spamming. so yes, it needs drastic changes."
12/31/2008,"the great thing about eve is, ccp is made up of gamers. the bad thing about eve is, ccp is made up of gamers.by being gamers themselves they are protecting their ability to dominate. war declarations in empire i'm willing to bet are often the longer term players dominating the lesser term players.consider a real life scenario,... two fighter pilots from opposing nations with comparable planes and munitions have an equal chance of winning a dogfight. granted, the pilot with the most experience has an advantage but can still lose the fight due to comparable equipment between the two. the problem with mmorpg games is they seldom account for outfitting new and long term players equally. this consistently leads to a dominance game where the longer term player has the advantage. it thereby takes the ""game"" out of gaming, which leads to boredom, that has to be countered with great graphics and new expansions in order to hold interest. in board games the long term player may have some experience advantage but since the new player is playing with the same equipment and on the same field he can also win.i don't have the solutions for this but therein is the problem with many mmo games.one avenue of thought would be, allow for attaining ships and munitions at a faster rate, thereby balancing the field between new and long term players. this helps compensate for the imbalance of equipment between the two.let experience be gained in skill areas like agility, speed, maneuvering, cloaking, etc,.. i wholeheartedly support solving the issue. good discussion thread and good ideas presented."

12/31/2008,"there should be a list of known existing exploits, however it should be made clear that you can be punished for doing something else too. clearly there's countless number of other undiscovered exploits too.i can understand where this is coming from, some people might think they cannot be punished if something wasn't listed as an exploit. this shouldn't be case, ever. exploits are usually something you take advantage on in secret, so it would be pretty difficult for gm's/devs to list them all, specifically.some people seem to think if there's an exploit and devs haven't done anything about it yet, it's their right to exploit it until it's fixed. rules about this kind of things should be made clear too."

12/31/2008,"forgot last suggestionhyperion just doesn't have a clear role at all. you can't really make it much of a mission ship since it has no range with blasters and has too much trouble fitting rails.you can't use it very well as a gang ship since ehp is more important after all the hp buffs and armor tanking is not fast enough to make up for the ehp difference from a plate/trimark setup. besides, you still can't fit rails, can't track, and can't get in range without dropping dps and range by switching to ions.in any fleet role, your lack of ehp and range is ridiculous. not to mention that worthless extra highslot...apoc, mega, and abaddon can actually use this slot for something worthwhile. rokh as well. maelstrom can at least fit a full rack of arties. you might as well fit a cloak to hide to your poorly setup ship.as a solo ship, you can't fit a mwd without dropping yet another blaster or going with ion's. still no range. your tank is unsustainable if you have to keep up with anything. the ehp difference on plate setups will more than cover the armor you can tank in that time.pretty much you're stuck with one niche of passable performance: wtz on a tackled target where you can tank it and gank it sustainably...except in this role, you still can't survive long against anything with large dps since armor tanking is slow and you're ehp is too low to make up the difference for long. add in the second repper. with reduced hp, you have to hold up your maximum tank since falling short will mean a quicker death. this means cap booster. now you can't even fit full t2 because you still have no grid. your dps with ions and no damage mods is still low.once again, other ships will do it better. just break out a big dps ship with lots of plate.it's partly symptomatic of other trends, like the advantages passive tanking setups have gained over active ones, but with the hyperion, there's really nothing left, and it's a shame since it's actually a pretty cool looking ship.since the duo ganking role is pretty much the only point where the hyperion almost works, i'd suggest buffing it in that role in the following ways:give it bigger cap and cap recharge to give it some focus for it's sustainable ganking-tanking role.give it a tad more grid so it can fit a full rack of blasters with active tanking setups for the ganking role.fix active tanking in general. hyperion and maelstrom need two mods to get up enough tank to really matter relative to plated/extender setups. those two slots lower the ehp quite a bit. the need for active tanking focused rigs further reduces the ehp you can tack on these two ships.drop a midslot for a low slot. hyp doesn't rely enough on drones or have any other real uses for mids compared to the need for damage and tanking mods. without some serious cap buff, a full rack of cap rechargers won't keep up with dual-reppers and a single repper is irrelevant compared to the hp of a plate setup"
12/31/2008,"i fly a maelstrom and have no issues with the ship, sure a 7th mid would be great, but the 6 slots for tanking makes it so i can't fit everything which makes it more interesting.the secret to hype fittings is using only one lar. if you go 2x lars you gotta drop to electrons or do some creative fitting but that is fine. gives it more fits then just one cookie-cutter do everything fit. do not underestimate the fifth mid post qr, being able to throw on a eccm or 2nd web or disruptor + scram is awesome. i like the variety.mega does the plate gank/snipe while hype does plate gank/active tank/bait. i don't see much of a problem here, active tanked ships are much better for smaller gangs. yikes. you don't need mids and you have cap problems, hmmmmmmm let's see if only there was a module that gave a lot of cap, maybe it could use charges..."
12/31/2008,"i would really like to see ""mini-objectives"" in plexes.they would act as triggers to speed or counter-act the plex timers.a simple example is that you have to destroy ship called ""lt. hoffnrolf"" and then the timer will lose 1-2 minutes off of it.another is, that in a random location within the plex (reasonable distance) another building becomes vulnerable for 'capture', and moving to and capturing this position by either forces will push the main timer in favor of that specific faction.so for example, minmatar plex, amarr capturing. the amarrians have the time down to 5 minutes. a building becomes vulnerable @ 30km from the timer and from the entry point, the minmatar fleet comes in, and goes to defend, moving to that vulnerable secondary objective and holding it for 2 minutes, which pushes the main timer in favor of their side by 2 minutes, allowing fighting over the plex to be extended long enough for reinforcements to come in.this allows more dynamic combat to occur in a plex, where different strategies can be employed to counteract the team in control, even if you can't always win it, it allows for dynamic strategies. right now, it's very repetitious.the side effect of this is also that plexes that are dead-quiet and not being defended at all will be captured faster because there are no defenders, and enhancing offense.::::personal note, not to detract from the above:::not to mention, i really really dislike the single-entry point plexes. this is really a poor solution to the plex strategies. there should be a method to enter the plex at different entry points, so that you are not always trapped and ganked at either the acceleration gate or at the entry point, and to add a little variety to the plex dynamic."
12/31/2008,"there is nothing wrong with the plexing mechanics to make systems vulnerablepeople that want to take a system should put some effort and organisation into itwith the current mechanics of speedtanking, 1 player alone in a vigil can make a system vulnerable without even any weapons fitted to the ship !fw was supposed to make people fight and not to make them sit in plexes speedtanking or 10+ hours a day(yes some minnies spend even far more time than that to speedtank plexes....)also funny that you complain about plexing mechanics while being number 1 in vp for the last 7 days...if you dont like the plexing mechanics then just stop plexing?"
12/31/2008,"yes, something definately needs to be done about this. it is completely unfair that minmatar militants can do every single plex in a t1 frigate, whereas for us to do that in minmatar systems, a small gang would be the least we could take the plex with. i agree with the other people posting, i think that you should have to kill all the rats before you take the plex, that way, faction warfare will become what it should be."

12/31/2008,"ohhh, i like this idea. you can just tell your ewar pilots to jam by name/ship class but it is a fairly chaotic arrangement and lots of ewar is wasted because the pilots don't know if they are overlapping ewar or not. thumbs up on this one."
12/31/2008,don't titans have officer smartbombs for things like this?
12/31/2008,"i have a solution to stop macro-mining and make mining more interesting:1. make asteroids huge, i mean as big as a starbase.2. most of the asteroid is worthless rock, valuable ores are located in veins on the asteroid surface. the veins need to be targeted manually i.e. they need to be eyeballed on the asteroid surface and the mining laser needs to be manually targeted to them.3. this is the key - make the veins difficult to see i.e. a human eye can discern them but a macro miner's macro program cannot, in a similar way to how captcha validation works.macro-mining programs will be unable to locate veins, or if they randomly target a roid it will take so long to locate a vein it will ruin the economics of macro-mining.[edit] developing this idea further:asteroids could contain veins of different ore in the same ratio as is currently found in belts. new skills around prospecting can be devised to help locate the richest veins. miners will then need to decide to mine a low-grade vein or spend time prospecting for a richer vein.prospecting could become a career in itself. a new prospector module could be provided for assessing the quality of an ore vein e.g. ore type, quality, quantity. the module can produce a report as an item which could then be sold using the contract system. those viewing the report can see the ore type, quality, quantity and perhaps the region/constellation. when purchased the bookmark is made available.this will make mining more interesting as a miners time can be split between mining and prospecting.comments?"
12/31/2008,interesting idea
12/31/2008,the best idea to get rid of them is to make people to stop buying isk from them. a higher punishment to people that buy isk.
12/31/2008,i.e. block for mining anyone with bad eyesight. the ui is already bad enough for that.no.
12/31/2008,good idea...but too complicated.would require a great deal of re-engineering the system.in all honesty the gm's should make a department dedicated to patrolling miners.
12/31/2008,yes
12/31/2008,"insurance should never pay out more than market value. hull loss on a bs can be a measly 2-10m. ccp wants to give people a choice on fitting more expensive items (boosters, rigs, etc) but really 2m isk loss for a battleship? oh and a **** you to all the people who want to nerf suiciding insurance, you are dumb and trying to nerf a mechanic that needs to be ingame just because you want to afk haul like a moron."
12/31/2008,yep
12/31/2008,"it easy to avoid a war as it is easy to declare one. until declaring a war has some real cost (not only in isk, but in work, so playtime lost) avoiding one will stay easy to keep a balance."
12/31/2008,"free = 1 billion isk, plus 2 million/month for each corporation, plus the skills. nice wallet you must have to consider that ""free""."
12/31/2008,"sure, i would back you, if they removed your ability to dock while be fired on.the one thing i have no respect for in eve is low life war dec corps that want nothing more than easy kills on newbs and haulers, and dock/log as soon as a decently sized force comes to play."
12/31/2008,i have seen 12 mom's hot dropped in at once.
12/31/2008,perhaps a duration reduction to 5 minutes or perhaps even less would be more appropriate?
12/31/2008,"having a way to produce them would be nice, i'd like to see 0.0 be more self contained, instead of having to jump to empire every time i want to invent. this would also apply to pos trade goods fuel."
12/31/2008,a way already exist: exploration.
12/31/2008,"the candidates i did not consider voting for are those who provided no information. those who at least attempted to create a web presence were considered. the candidate i did vote for did not have the most spectacular web presence but had enough of one so that i could understand their views.it's a good question, issler dainze, and i hope future csm candidates pay attention to the answers. you were my second pick but i only got one vote. -sorry. :)edit addition: as a relatively new player, i still did not know about the csm area of the forums at the time of the second csm election."
12/31/2008,"voted ankh, cause she made a good impression at the fanfest"
