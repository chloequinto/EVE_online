5/1/2010,"this is a terrible and ill thought out idea that will either do nothing to help blasters or ruin the concept of racial balance in evefor more info, see below."
5/1/2010,"ahhh, the good old blaster thread, how i love thee... not really.i've been telling everyone for years how crap blasters are and how much they need a damage boost, and now that someone else is saying the same thing (lol) everyone suddenly agrees? anyhoo...what blasters don't need: range buffs. what they do need: massive damage and tracking increases.right now the ac/laser balance is just wonderful. acs have damage choice and plenty of range, lasers have great range and plenty of dps and quick change ammo. scorch range is insane.what blasters need is a nice 50% dps increase across the board, a little more optimal for small and mediums and a 100-200% tracking boost."
5/1/2010,"i too love constructive criticism :)@bellum, while i love your support, i do believe that such a boost would probably be game breaking, although i'm pretty sure you're kidding ^^. but still, a boost is needed, nonetheless."
5/1/2010,"there isn't an argument to be constuctive about. its just ""waaaaa"". but i was not joking that you should read the link"
5/1/2010,"whatever, mate. if you say that the changes proposed are going to break racial balance or break blasters, you're wrong. blasters and railguns are already broken. let me give you a good example:there's an op scheduled and you're going pos bashing. your fc asks for battleships that can hit at 50km, which is pretty much short range, really. now, you're a gallente pilot and you think: ""alright, i'll be fine, i'll just use railguns for this."" so, you arrive at the battlefield and realize all those armageddons, apocs, abaddons, typhoons, tempests and maelstroms are all using short range weapons, probably coupled with t2 long range ammo. and you're sitting there thinking: ""great. my contribution to this fleet is next to nothing, since im using rails with short range ammo, so i can only really hit at 27+24 and im already playing in deep falloff, so my accuracy is cut down by 50%. i love being gallente"".granted, this example is a perfect illustration of how there is indeed racial flavour and how some guns are for each situation. now, if what ccp wants is that blasters are better for small gang warfare, well great, but then, give more speed to gallente ships so they can reach targets faster (just an example of a proposed change). and if ccp does think that blasters are suited for less blobbage, then boost railguns.again ladies and gentlemen, i'm all open for constructive arguments on these thoughts."
5/1/2010,first of all i support this there is some imbalance but not only in blastersi think there should be one whole expansion on balancing all the races all the weapons and all kinds of tankingi know this may sound like a bit much but its really necessary!
5/1/2010,"apoc: mega pulse ii scorch : 584 dps @ 50kmmega: 425 rail ii non faction antimatter: 468 dps @ 50km.oh noes!!!! now it isn't as good as a geddon since that can field bouncers just as well as the mega can. but the geddon isn't as close to cap stable as either...the reason that people like amarr ships for pos bashing is not that they do a lot of dps(after all, minnie pos are pretty popular) its because they never have to reload and so once you get a cap stable pos basher you can go afk while you kill the thing.you clearly didn't read the link. here is one that isn't in my sig so you don't miss it.there is nothing wrong with railguns. its already been shown in the railgun thread that the rokh is the best fleet sniper in the game."
5/1/2010,1
5/1/2010,"468 dps at 50 km? do you mean at 36+30km? unless you want to waste slots with some tes just to be on par with the other bss... besides, try fitting a 425mm megathron designed to shoot at 50 km that can also fit rrs. it doesn't work. you have to use 350mm, which are even worse.another reason for choosing lasers over hybrid guns, am i right?i will read it when i have time, thanks.i strongly disagree with this. the rokh is not the best fleet sniper. it's the best fleet 'tickler'. it doesn't shoot bullets, it shoots bb pellets.in any case, thank you for being more constructive this time."
5/1/2010,"oh, well then that cuts down significantly the dps of the apoc(was an 8 gun version used) if you're demanding rr fits. i mean, in that case, run a dominix. its a great rr ship.this is because you do not know what makes fleet snipers good."
5/1/2010,most snipers engage at a range of about 170-180km. there's no need for a ship that hits 220+ and does minimal damage when you can get one that hits at 180km and has 2x the damage.
5/1/2010,"xahara just ignore guomi ,he tries to attack every topic which tries to bring hybrids back to usefull lvl.btw guomi's good fleet sniper cant run its guns more than 3.5mins from full cap ,that should show how good he is at balacing.in short ignore him."
5/1/2010,"rokh does 320 dps @ 190km. so you're saying you have a 640 dps sniper @ that range?somehow i doubt it.oh, and dps is not everything. seriously, go to the other thread, we've been over this many times."
5/1/2010,"i'd would rather have this as an ability which cost a little amount of fuel, cap, resource or large amount of time because having to sacrifice an entire module slot for a mechanic which is purely designed to be out of battle recovery of your fighters (unless triage mode is used) does not make it worthwhile. plus the idea of a carrier not having a maintenance deck for it's primary weapons makes no sense role-wise."

5/1/2010,absolutely!

5/1/2010,this.
5/1/2010,"i'll keep it short, ccp, what's wrong with you ?yes, i support the request, this mission is unfair compared with the storyline missions from the other factions and, as you could probably see, 90% of us deny it because the risk is too big compared with the reward."
5/1/2010,support
5/1/2010,lots of support from me. had a similiar idea.
5/1/2010,"bottom line is everyone that is opposed to this idea either has t2 bpo's or has access to them thru, corp, alliance or friend. they are spewing sheer propaganda at everyone in hopes they can keep their massive advantage over the newer player base/all other industrials. crying for facts is plain stupid unless you failed grade school math. its not that hard to figure out. for all you simpletons out there i will even do it for you.the basics:t2 bpo base waste factor is -10% base production lvl -10% vs. base waste factor of an invented bpc -50% and production -50%.t2 bpo's can be research just like t1's. essentially they have less than 0.01% waste factor an production level modifiers.t2 invented bpc's using a decryptors (which cost between 5 million for one that wont do much up to and well over 50 million for the best ones.) you could get -30% me and pe roughly, maybe a couple extra runs.t2 bpo's can be copied, giving full max runs in the end.t2 invented bpc's w/o decryptores will yield a maximum of 10% the t2 max run number or less most of the time far less.t2 bpo's owners dont have to waste time waiting for the invention process or the extra copying time it takes to get the t1 bpc's to run invention on. again no time wasted with failed invention jobs and no loss of isk from wasted datacores. and again t2 bpo owners don't have to waste slots to run the invention jobs.using a decryptor cost 10's of millions per job, also in most cases it also lowers the chance of success and will never even come close to offering the me, pe, or amount of runs as a t2 bpo has. let alone all three anywhere a t2 bpo's lvl. bottom line:t2 deimos bpo: with >0.1 me and pe would cost the owner 69 million to build, these items are all bought from the market and at prices that are all higher than jita prices and thats it, owner has a 10 run copy and it costs him less than 70 million to build it will sell for over 100 million on the market. quick and super easy 30 million profit.now lets look at a newer player building the same ship inventing from a t1 bpo. first and foremost there is also a tonne more skills the newer player will need just to attempt an invention on the t1's bpo's bpc's. secondly inventing a ship has less than a 25% chance of success with all relevant invention skills maxed. first things first: the invention process. each attempt at invention will require 16 data cores, 8 gallenean starship engineering ones, and 8 mechanical engineering ones. each attempt at invention will cost the new player 4.8 million isk, and going by best case chances one in four should be a success, let me tell you that is rarely the case 1 in 10 in my experience. so total cost to get a single run t2 deimos bpc for this is a minimum of 19.5 million isk. step two: ship components. are you ready this is where things get really bad. on a stock t2 invented bpc there is a 50% waste factor so if that ship cost 70 million to build it will cost the newer player 100 million to build. i subtracted 5 million since you will not need two thoraxes. so 19.5 million pluse 100 million equals 120 million.now i know some dumba** is going to say, well you could have used a decryptor and i am not inclined to go into all the different kinds of decryptors but again bottom line you will get no significant decrease in me and pe. and with the sheer cost of the good decryptors, 50+ million for one and its consumed on the job you use it on, will simple present a dead wash for any potential benefits it might grant for that one job and only if it works.these are facts generated on an excel sheet with the market prices from this evening. the t2 market is broken because of t2 bpo's either ccp needs to nerf their abilities, for instance make them have a -4 me lvl, and reduce their max runs per copy or they need to be removed from game. i will not respond to any flamers, ragers, or whiners. don't even bother. for all those who are new to eve and even just invention do not be swade by the liars. there is a lot of purely psychopathic people in eve and they will tell lies about anything, some time for their own gain, come times because they find it fun. they will eve n lie about things that can be easily researched and confirmed./signed total agree something needs to be done about t2 bpos. either nerf or complete removal."
5/1/2010,"nobut i have some other proposals to ""equalize"" all players:ccp request 1: delete all event rewards (unique items)ccp request 2: delete randomly titan a/o other capitalsccp request 3: delete randomly outposts"
5/1/2010,thanks for the support!
5/1/2010,"repost of this threadoriginal thread is more than 120 days old, so i cannot just bump it and get it to your attention.as the ceo of a small corp i find that one of the tasks i use the most time on is locking down (and unlocking) bpos. to be able to lock down a new bpo, i have to do the following...1) attempt to start a research job or the like with the bpo with a char that has no research slots available so the job does not start. this process includes several accept windows, about 10 mouseclicks.2) propose a lockdown vote3) vote4) waitas the majority stockholder, i would like to have an extra right-click option for bpos - only open for ceos fx called ""majority lockdown"". the effect of the option would be to make the bpo locked down in one simple move instead of the 10 or so mouseclicks i have to do now just to be able to propose the lockdown vote.so, in essence - if you support a one click majority lockdown rightclick option for ceos, vote in support of this topic.thank youamanda"
5/1/2010,"ok, i am obviously in favour! - and i hate this 5 minute wait before i can support my own thread!"
5/1/2010,yup.
5/1/2010,definitely would be nice
5/1/2010,as a ceo this would be beneficial
5/1/2010,the bpo lockdown is a really annoying process.
5/1/2010,"ok, so everyone knows that bombs are over powered. there is no arguing that. i propose the following changes:bombs cause no damage if bomber is not on grid.right now a bomber can simply align, decloak, bomb and warp off all within less than a second with no risk.remove this ""i win button!!!"""
5/1/2010,"wouldn't work as bombers kind of depend on the short exposure time for their survival.tweak the resists on bombs to limit the maximum possible within a certain period of time would solve the issue, without ruining the value of the well drilled squads.it is only an iwin button if it is available to the rabble."
5/1/2010,"a timesaver, absolutely in favor."
5/1/2010,would kill for this.
5/1/2010,hope to see this soon - supporting for speed!someone didn't read the whole thread...
5/1/2010,"mr. bellum, you know this for a fact how? i'm sorry to break it down for ya, but when you create a thread you realize people are allowed to post their opinions in it? you sound mad. the only advice i can give you is you need to calm down and let people disagree with you. mkay?"
5/1/2010,"c'mon guys. the system needs work and this is not going to help.as much as i could put a boatload of ""work"" into what i think a good change to local, and scanning, would be, ccp tends to be deaf to these things. not like they don't care. lately i have dealt with a game company on drm matters (no, not ""that"" company) and seeing what their schedules are like removes any assumption that cpp does not care. eve is a legacy system and it's hard to change things. simple as that.the way to look at local is from both directions, and how that affects you depends on your goal. from the gankee's, or potential gankee (everybody is, even the gankers) point of view, local is the tool that lets you know when a threat is in the system. without it, it is said, you will get instaganked all the way back to the start station, with a big red l tattooed on your clone's ass. so it's said. but what i have seen most of the time is, when going in via a gate, a half dozen pwnage-geared ships show up on that gate, and sometimes another half on the other gate. in 0.0 bubbles go up. i have heard many a tale of 5 bs going after one cruiser, or something like that. but how do they know there is fresh meat? local told them.(this is why i have yet to use a gate in 0.0. how? look at my sig).so you see, either someone is going into a system looking for some blood (in game) and will get some aid in finding it, via local, or someone in a system is waiting for blood and will be alerted to it by local.removing local will affect them both. nobody gets an ""i win"" button. the predator still needs to find the prey, the prey still needs to look out. of course, belts cannot be mined or ratted in this case. really? if you have a team you can. but this is not my opinion. ccp set it up that way. they can't stand lone wolves. if putting a probe launcher on your mining ship, for example, to find hidden belts, even if you pull in enough isk to pay for the ship twice over per day, is too much of a hit, then you have to learn adaptation. putting some mods on the ship to make it harder to scan will gimp it. but if it's all about isk per hour, then is it still a game or is this ""bread-snatcher online""? i can do a 0.0 radar site in a horribly gimped exploration fit and once managed to online a hack mod in the middle of combat and keep fighting because there were combat probes appearing in the d-scan (i managed to get the loot, by the way). do i pound mission after mission, belt after belt, and rat away until my standings are so high i could smartbomb a noob station and still not be red? no. i think people don't want to rely on anyone else because they feel it's ccp arbitrarily forcing a game style on them. they don't want to group up, so therefore nobody should have to fit a ship for anything less than making maximum isk while alone. but this simple does not work. ccp does not want that to work.and who am i to dare such opinions? this is my main. i never joined a corp, i work alone, and accept that ccp absolutely despises lone wolves. but for me that only makes things more interesting. (so keep hating us, ccp). unless they come up with a mechanic that makes an un-fleeted ship explode on undock this won't matter to people who log in to play, not earn imaginary money. bottom line is you cannot expect maximum input working alone in a game that is specifically designed against it. i only have half a billion isk (not counting all the phat loot i am too lazy to contract). i like the game still.all that should be asked for is, no matter what the outcome, that some improvement to the way of detecting enemy scanning operations be made a little more automatic or easier. there are already ways to make a scanner have to move probes in closer to get a warpable (and thus be detected). the ui for scanning is not very good, and so everybody should just agree to have some agreement on that and leave the rest to ccp (because they change little else)."
5/1/2010,"do some missions or exploration in lowsec, then come back and say with a straight face that the directional scanner is exciting or thrilling."
5/1/2010,"delayed local works in wh's because of the difficulty of getting there, the mass limits and the changing nature of the route in/or out every 16 hours.none of those constraints exist in 0.0 or low-sec, so the only effect of delayed local would be to encourage more blobs, and make the game less fun by demanding constant spamming of the d-scan... last i heard, ccp nerfed the d-scan because it was one of the causes of lag...not supported in this incarnation, until/unless ccp implements some other type of intell tool.no."
5/1/2010,"this. put a delay in local and the only other solution to gain up to date defensive intel for smaller alliances is sit somebody on a every gate in the system and watch it 23/7. now i don't know about you, but that doesnt sound like a whole lot of fun or something very many people are willing to do.additionally over time you are going to get less targets due to ratters/miners currently in 0.0 deciding that its to dangerous to pve there and going back to empire.i do support putting a delay on local however there must be an reasonable alternative to gathering intel which currently is not in place.not supported."
5/1/2010,"there seems to be an unsupported assumption running rampant in this thread:that we need instant, complete intel of a system.yes, we have it now. yes, we're used to operating with it. but i am not convinced that it is an absolute necessity. it's just that we've grown so used to our comfort blanket that we cant conceive of being without it.maybe we should just step back for a moment and think about what eve would be like without instant, reliable system-wide intel. you see a lot of people complaining that one system is much like another, space is all the same, etc etc. what if the size and layout of a system really mattered?what if different classes of ships had different scanner characteristics? you could introduce variables like range, accuracy, sensitivity, re-scan frequency. you could also modify these variables according to fit. for instance, an active cloak should have a very strong penalty to scanner use; or perhaps even using the scanner would temporarily disable the cloak! active eccm should make one hard to scan, but it should also make your scanner less accurate. a sensor booster would work in the opposite fashion.what if using the scanner made you easier to scan? what if this varied by sensor type? (eg: using ladar scanners makes you show up more easily to ladar sensors, but makes no difference to gravimetric sensors).if we think about the possibilities that dropping local as an omni-intel tool would offer us, i think that the inevitable conclusion would be that there would be a huge amount of actual gameplay potential added. space would seem big again. scouting would be more than keeping an alt at a safespot; it would become a player-skill based profession. and i think that we'd get more and better fights, to be honest. these days, 0.0/lo-sec pvp is mostly about evading fights until you can hotdrop the enemy with 3x their numbers. it has become stale and it's time for a shakeup. engaging the enemy without perfect intel would be risky, it would be exciting, it would be fun.incidentally, i think local in empire should remain more or less as it is."
5/1/2010,"would be a shame to do this to lowsec tbh. the fun would sortof diminish after engaging bait for 5+ times only to get ganked by 15 cloaky ships; what would be left is either people flying the now mandatory nano-stuff and blobs (with a good helping of now unspottable cloakers). eve players tend to find simple and effective solutions; blobbing (and cloaking) becomes more effective.for instance, i did preety much everything when it comes to lowsec piracy, from solo (which i like doing best) to small gangs, large gangs and gatecamps. when i plug these changes in the picture, you know, the riskyness of a gatecamp changes very little (since you will have covops scouts giving you exact intel on what jumped and so on, from at least one system away, two in case of, eg. bellum). large gangs again are going to have little problems with intel gathering; and they'll have less of a ""gtfoooo"" factor since you won't see local jump by 11ty billion. as gangs get smaller they get more penalized since less scouts ara available, it's harder to deal with cloaking ships, etcetera.furthermore, it preety much renders any activity which does not take place away from celestials preety suicidal. in w-space where everything has to be probed down first, this is ok; you have a good chance of saving yourself by watching for probes (and w-space has a number of other things which make the no-local thing work out better).i have yet to find one idea to rework intel in eve which does not carry negative (from my point of view) consequences."
5/1/2010,"i specifically mentioned strong penalties to scanning with cloaks fitted, and really there is a limit to the number of gates that one can attentively watch on grid at once. turn away for 10 seconds, and you could miss someone going through.as for cheap lo-sec ganks.... how is what you describe much different to what we have at present? all that happens at the moment is engage bait -> cyno goes up -> haha i pwn u n00bs. shall we ask ccp to extend local to include everyone within titan-bridge range?no. set your own traps."
5/1/2010,"grasping at straws now (particularly with that bit where cloaking recons are just as acessible as a titan / cap fleet, orly).look, it's preety simple; rp and stuff aside, how does your system change combat and what benefits over the current situation do you think are likely to come from that?"
5/1/2010,i support no local in 0.0 and maybe even low sec. -people say that it will suck/lag using the direction scan a lot. well i basically use it all the time anyways cause local is rarely clear and everyone else should be too so really whats the difference.-also how does it make it easier for ganks? pirates wont even know your there until your on each others scans and then they have to find you. this does however boost cloakers so easiest solution would be to cut the range of directional scanning while cloaked or even make it impossible.
5/1/2010,this
5/1/2010,"then it would just make metagaming even more important in 0.0 if there wasn't a game design mechanic for intel.1. login spy, join enemy fleet.2. analyse fleet numbers and makeup.3. relay it to your superiors and organize a counter blob.4. ?????5. profit!yet you also are forgetting some of the conseqences dropping local without a proper intel tool. the powerblocs will remain as is, even encouraging them to stay together so they can share intel channels.i don't deny the potential for *goodfights* would be increased, its just that that potential would realistically never materialise."
5/1/2010,"well, all that is interesting (to one degree or another) but as it doesn't exist in game now, it doesn't very much apply to what the op wants, i.e. ""remove local in 0.0 and low-sec...""imho - that alone does nothing to make gameplay any better, and (again, imho) would just encourage more blobbing.what malcanis suggests has some merit, and would give additional tools to hunters and the hunted. but *until* there are some kind of tools for gathering intell on a system, other than ""jump in and pray"" i can't support this proposal as i believe it would bring more negatives than positives to the game.oh! and to the op ""people don't deserve to fly in 0.0 and low-sec...."" comment? if they pay their subscription, they pretty much ""deserve"" to fly wherever they hell they want!"
5/1/2010,"that is the entire issues, pirates (especially in 0.0) know exactly in which system the pve'ers are."
5/1/2010,how is this different to what happens now?
5/1/2010,"1. do u know why ppl need that reliable, instant, intel system that shouldn't require ppl to be an alliance tool to access? it's the only defense that the target has, with the mechanics heavily favoring the attackers and in numbers.2. why would u only propose changes to scanning to ""compensate"" for this? r u telling us that pvp is actually getting those fights rather than the fight itself? that that's what it all boils down to? to blob up, catch your enemy and ez kill to pad your killboard? guess what? not everyone hides behind a blob like u do and that's why they shouldn't be forced to. what u're really pushing forward is not more and better fights--it's more ez ganks. getting a fight isn't pvp--it's cat and mouse and your proposal will only encourage more of the ""evading fights"" that u ***** about. not to mention, u want to make all covert ops frigates useless for the sole purpose of this as well.3. let's see, what would it be like without local? blobs, blobs, and...more blobs outblobbing small gangs? in case u haven't noticed, u're forgetting (most likely, on purpose) one factor--the players' behavior. your problem is for some stupid reason, u're convinced with this ""sunshine and rainbows"" notion that the whole eve playerbase is perfect and ""honorable"", that they would gladly and ""honorably"" fight a duel or an even an even-number gang skirmish, that they would never in good conscience, blob anything that they would not take even one loss from and run from every other situation. this might come as a surprise for u but...it doesn't work that way. either wake up and get back to (virtual) reality or keep dreaming and idealizing all u like--it certainly ain't gonna change the players, except hinder pvp or even simply setting foot in low sec/0.0, which goes against ccp's stated goals."
5/1/2010,"in terms of time and effort, this is by far the most significant part of pvp."
5/1/2010,yup. pvp starts way before the first target lock is established.
5/1/2010,"i was going to post this, but mal beat me to it lol."
5/1/2010,"as things are now in eve, i wont support this. don't even think about getting me to support this, as long there isn't a totally new type of local that works in a different way than the current local is working.removing local today will create 90457860989068450984 more problems for just fixing some small things that really isn't a big problem in eve today.i can see the benefit of having local removed, but like i said, as things in eve are today, i will say this with big letters: not supported."
5/1/2010,lol!skills go in your head not in your cargohold.
5/1/2010,this idea would bring some much needed balance to the pirating aspect of the game.
5/1/2010,"if intigo and dianeces support, then this obviously must be a solid idea."
5/1/2010,this reeks of a good idea
5/1/2010,"just because william's idea conflicts with your idea of how the game should be played doesn't mean it should be instantly dismissed as a troll. personally i feel eve is too heavily stacked in favour of the unsavoury sorts (pirates, greifers, etc) and william's idea is the only fair way of rectifying this situation without introducing arbitray gameplay limitations (eg. wow-esque pvp flagging). making anti-social play hit pirates where it hurts, their (parents) credit cards, should make them think twice about engaging in such behavoir.removed comment unrelated to the game - adida"
5/1/2010,i think anyone that would harm another player's hard earned assets deserves to pay behind in game. i fully support this idea.
5/1/2010,"lolbtw mad idea... i mean, this is kinda' reality simulation, in terms of punishment... just you can't die... so called ""piracy"" is a lifestyle... well... i don't know if i'm a pirate... can anyone describe me pirates in eve...i mean, i'm on nbsi - that means, if its a hauler, if its a battleship, i don't care... i'll just try to kill it, without makeing a suicide..."
5/1/2010,fail proposal is fail
5/1/2010,"to all who are supporting this nonsense, a few things must be remembered. eve is neither a pvp game or a pve game it is both. but what makes eve what it is, is the fact that both need to be taken into consideration on the players part. pvp can happen anywhere, and it is not limited to blowing stuff up. market pvp is just as important to industrialists and carebears as it is to dyed in the wool pvpers.so with your idea i will be charged more money for participating in activities that are specifically designed to make the game function the way it does. when i blow up a ship i will be charged more money? when i modify a market order to make a sale, i will be charged more money?if you fly into low-sec and then rely on your jump cloak to keep you safe while you take a phone call or use the bathroom, you deserve all you get. dock up before you take the call, or better yet, don't go into low-sec if you are waiting for a call, or even better yet, do both at the same time. it's not that hard to talk on the phone and play eve at the same time.there are so many ridiculous holes in this idea i can't even stand to comment on it further."
5/1/2010,"me calling his post a troll is the only way i can justify it being on the forum. it's simply too stupid of an idea to be otherwise. and he can't possibly be that stupid, right?second: you're wrong on all counts. if you want to play an mmo that has no pvp aspects and no personal cost when *you* make a mistake, go play hello kitty online."
5/1/2010,"ding ding we have a winner ladies and gentlemen!!to the subject at hand, from business perspective it would be suicide to charge a huge(he stated all pvp, not just piracy) segment of the eve population more money per month. but yeah excellent troll otherwise, it put a smile on my face."
5/1/2010,so the w-hole that my corp has staked as its territory cannot be defended against tourists who stip out the good ore and run the sights b4 we get the chance to harvest? silly just plain silly.
5/1/2010,"i havent read too far down. probably this has been discussed, but....1) they should be able to use covert ops cloaks. all the other classes can, so should they.2) they should have longer jump range than carriers. (if not infinate, inc wh space)jump range = carrier - rorq - dread - jf - mom - titan - black op. (atm, i think)doesnt make sense as they ship types get bigger then black ops is the size of battleship. hmmm."
5/1/2010,1. no they should not be able to use the covop cloak. unlike the covops/recons they have quite a bit of ehp. so the covop cloak would make it overpowered.2. no wh space is not reachable via cynos in purpose.
5/1/2010,"yes to slight expansion in jump range, but not to the extent you propose. disagree about a cov ops cloak on the black opps ship, yes it has ehp, but its ehp is nothing compared to that of other ships in its price range, and even less than its tec 1 counterparts. yes a black opps ship would be powerfull, but consider the following #1 its expensive as all hell and a highly desired kill. black opps=primary #2 its skill intensive as hell.blackopps= over a year of training to get into. and closer to 2 years for it to be flown well. all a cov opps cloak would really do is let it warp while cloaked. the ship is still weak compared to its tec 1 counterpart."

5/1/2010,"[proposal] increasing mission running difficulty with only a minor changeone way to increase difficulty of npc units in missions, is to make npc's actually use their warp drive when they are in trouble when they reach structure. that is when npc's lose their shields and armor that they should actually attempt to run and save themselves, just as real players do.however make it possible to warp scramble npc's.i believe this will increase the difficulty in mission running, as players either have to be fast enough to be in warp disrupt range, and/or have a friend assist in catching a npc. example a friend flying an interceptor. pro'sthis will have the added benefits of encouraging more:* team based mission running* warp disruptor / scramblers use* newer players exposed to understanding pvp dynamics and why a warp disruptor is important.* challenge and increased difficulty in mission runningcon's * players complaining of not being able to use their solo / slow sniper dps mobiles to mission run with* players complaining of having to run missions as a team* players complaining of actually having to use an afterburner in mission running to 'catch' npc's.notes:* there are thousands of times where in a npc fight, player c warps away from npc a, when they feel they are about to be blown up, and they are not warp scrambled.* there are thousands of times where in a pvp fight, player b warps away from player a, when they feel they are about to be blown up, and they are not warp scrambled* there are almost zero times where a npc fight, npc a warps away from player c, when it was in danger of being blown up.* i do not believe this will require a huge amount of coding to implement, nor will it require new items, or new ai tech for npc's in order to improve the challenge.maybe have this only kick in once players are doing level 3 and high missions as well as when fighting non mission npc's.oh and said npc can warp back, moments later perhaps with randomly [full/half] [shield/armor/structure]"
5/1/2010,"it is not a minor change even in that meaning of the definition. you are adding several check to what the npc should do and substantially changing his capabilities. it is the usual problem: if you add those calculations player side someone will hack the client and cheat, if you add them server side you add to the burden of the server. if that kind of change has to be implemented you need to go all the way as yamamoto suggested.not really a pro. even if eve is a mmorpg being forced to always play in a group is a bad idea. the only result will be to push people playing in timezones with a limited number of players to leave. as already pointed out, it will push toward homogenized set up. so 2 of 4 of your ""pro"" points are actually very doubtful. ah, last thing, if this is implemented belt/complexes rats should do the same.it will be trivial for 1 player doing 1 mission. when you start having 20 players doing 20 missions, or the rats in all the complexes in your upgrade system checking if they should warp or not and so on, it will be less trivial. then there is the problem of ""finding"" the fleeing rats if they are the main target. a solution would be to require to scan for them but then we will add another request for the server. for me the problem is that modifying the pve content one piece at a time will make a patchwork with little rime or reason. if it should be done, it should be a big overhaul rebalancing and redoing most of it. especially if you are speaking of missions where changing only some of them will push the missioning people toward what is easier or make more profit leaving 3/4 of the content abandoned."
5/1/2010,"in terms of server load, this is trivial. no opinion on whether this specifically is a good idea or not, but i'm generally in favour of more things that make people actually have to be at their computer to run missions."
5/1/2010,"that is not the main problem, the main problem with this idea is severely limiting the amount of viable ships*fittings."
5/1/2010,"yes, please!"
5/1/2010,ow gawd yes!

5/1/2010,supported
5/1/2010,i like!
5/1/2010,supported. i have seen this problem when trying to move pos modules - suddenly the ship is moved 30km too.
5/1/2010,"i dunno why nobody hadn't mentioned and suggested that before. to be quick: fix the activation timers for they to be shown when a module with the only last charge is manually activated. it's all ok with them when the last charge is used by automatic repeat, but they're not shown when you activate the module with one charge left yourself. and when you deactivate module (that state when you 'activate' it again and it's flashing red), surprisingly the timer and flashing are shown normally.it is quite irritating not to know whether the module is doing its cycle or it has run out of charges (don't remind me about lags the notification, it is not written with big red letters in the screen center). the most prominent example are medium capacitor boosters loaded with the 800th charges: you activate it, its icon looks like it is a unactive unloaded cap booster, and then it eventually begins to reload and blink. and it is double irritating when you put your charges into a medium cargo container from which they can't be automatically loaded into the cap booster, and don't have enough spare cargo space to put there even one cap booster charge ready to be loaded; and then you begin to guess when it is time to drag a charge from the container onto the module to reload it, and of course failing in it, trying and trying again when at last the cycle is over and you see your pretty cap booster happily blinking."

5/1/2010,"ccp will only ever improve the search as part of the new forums we're getting sometime after duke nukem forever.use eve-search.oh, and no matter how good they make the forums, i guarantee we'll keep seeing the same threads over and over."
5/1/2010,"exactly like eve-search but really, why can't ccp do this, rather than relying on chribba, this idea is to stop lazy players who don't bother googling, and if you google, you almost always get an eve-search file."
5/1/2010,found this little chestnut in another thread...solves my proposal.
5/1/2010,"i really like how everyone is playing the dumb card in this thread.if you are going to post in the forums, you have to log in via an account. in my proposal, out of the three characters on that account you logged into, it will force you to post with which ever character has the highest amount of skill points.if you have multiple accounts then so be it. the concept is very simple."
5/1/2010,"the csm should question ccp as to why the alien-fx feature was implemented ahead of other more pressing issues.the alien-fx feature will only benefit a tiny proportion of players whilst there are undoubtedly issues in the backlog that would take just as much effort to fix but would benefit far more (if not all) players.this is the kind of thing the csm was created for, more transparency and communication from ccp."
5/1/2010,"ccp will probably recieve a royalty or commisions for alien-fx, they won't however get as much money for nerfing blasters. as we all know they need to be nerfed."
5/1/2010,"dell ""you know we got this kind of useless feature in our hardware, cant you do something with it? we pay you this much money for it""ccp ""sure""on dev works on it for a day or two ... and from the money they get for it... they can pay more devs to work on other issues. sounds like a good deal to me."
5/1/2010,or...go out for pizza? i dont see them hiring a new guy even if dell paid them
5/1/2010,the existing guys need payment too ;)
5/1/2010,i see what you did there
5/1/2010,"honestly, i don't care who pays for the airline ticket: while i can pay my own way, i hate flying (at least a jet - prop jobs i'm fine with) and it doesn't matter to me who is paying for hours on a bloody jet. it's going to s**k either way.but it would be interesting to see who would sign up for csm though if the flight and booze were not covered."
5/1/2010,"would invincible/infallible concord still be a necessity? i could get behind a bounty system that, say, globally flagged a criminal until their 'debt' was paid. maybe an npc bounty of, oh.. 5-10 million (players could add this) to be collected upon ship destruction. further crimes dig their hole deeper. payout % is based on ship type. killing a battleship pays more than a frigate, etc. insurance could be voided, not for the initial highsec gank, but for the duration of their 'wanted' status. this is an unfortunate measure, really, but i can't think of another way to make sure they don't simply have a friend kill unfitted battleships to 'purge' their crimes. other pirates/individuals with low security would be able to reduce their own bounty and raise their sec status by killing them. thus a pvp form of security grinding is introduced. of course, as a trade-off, the 'suicide' part of highsec piracy would need to be removed. do you have an idea for how this can be done without making it a true killing field? i'd hate to see gangs of 50 disposable tech1 frigate alts ganking everyone not on a gate/station with impunity and then being recycled. even ignoring the above idea: do you want less npc consequences, and more player consequences? or just more consequences in general?"
5/1/2010,"they can petition some gms and explain before the court why they killed some innocents and pay reparations to the victims. otherwise they can rot in lowsec where murderous vermin belongs.i think it's time for some real consequence for criminal behaviour. jailtime, statloss, no insurance, whatever it takes to stomp out this antisocial behaviour. they can do what they want in 0.0, but don't expect us to pay for their bull in empire space! hi there again....so how did petitioning to get your horrible-fit navy domi go? a-you didn't get it back because you were smacked under game mechanics.b-based on ship fitting you don't have a clue how to fit/fly ships properly and hence have little game mechanic understanding.c-your phoney exaggerated ""lolgamedesign"" experience is the rough equal to me drawing runequest modules 20 years ago on graph paper and calling myself a ""game designer"".d-you wish to change the game to fairies-online. i wonder why ccp has not hired you yet...oh wa-- look...perhaps you are a decent person outside the game. ingame you are a terrible choice for anything that puts you in any position to remotely effect change. just go away and be a quiet little furry bear in empire and let the playa's play.**a kindly edit**if you were to just stick to a pve boosting endeavor or something i would happily applaud your efforts. it's by sticking your nose in areas you are incompetent and unqualified to judge (i.e.anything pvp-related) and hurf-blurfing random babble regarding same that makes you look a horrible advocate for change on a macro-scale."
5/1/2010,"google 'hotep shakkara'- this is the name of anks alt and guild wars character if you want to know more about this candidates feelings on pvp, solo play and why she plays computer games.i found it very interesting.ank, you didn't asnswer mty question with regaurd to vandalism and defacement of other peoples property so i take it you still endorse this kind of behaviour."
5/1/2010,"that's basically how i envisioned it yes. could be implemented in an entirely freeform fashion where everyone can participate, or when players have to mark themselves as vigilante (which could be expanded on, for example: by the removal of the npc cargo scans for contraband, but put that in the player's hands as well: if you carry contraband and the vigilante scans you, he'll get killrights on your ship).yes, killing a player with negative sec status, while having a higher sec status yourself, should award a sec status bonus. i think this postitively influences the roe in lowsec as well, as the current sec status hit for initiating combat against a known offender often makes no sense, and currently causes many players to lose sec status from lowsec pvp even if they aren't technically pirates but just are the ones that shot first. seen a lot of this crap with factional warfare as well.that's a major problem yes, you can't hold the players truly accountable for their actions, because if the consequences would be too harsh, people start recycling characters or use trial accounts with destroyers.short term: more player consequence, same npc consequencelong term: even more player consequence, less npc consequence"
5/1/2010,no it wasn'twould you care to explain?
5/1/2010,"as a former corp mate of ankh, i must publically state that i do not believe she should be a part of the csm. her attitudes towards eve are terrible and she has spent a great deal of time in game chat moaning about how puzzle pirates, a game aimed at young children, is in every way superior to eve. apparently the most important thing in ankh's vision of eve will be the ability to change the colour of your trousers. i urge anyone who cares in the slightest about the future development of eve gameplay to vote for any other candidate. from what i've seen and my interactions there is no worse choice available.i've just one thing to say to you ankh, take your crayons and go play another game."
5/1/2010,and she wants that sort of power in eve? i have no words
5/1/2010,i'd rather vote my toaster onto the csm than ankh. having had to endure a massive tirade on how eve is a worthless game that isnt a real sandbox (apparently puzzle pirates is what eve should be...and eve cannot be a sandbox until such time as we have tailors...) from her in corp chat i can think of no one i would trust less to help direct the future of this game.
5/1/2010,"server was already dead for a while in 2007, as most players moved to wow to play with their friends that couldn't stand uo's backwards graphics. since i was still at the public server lists in the hope of attracting players, random players would jump in for no other reason than cause trouble by harrassing and insulting people. only a solid german community remained and i switched the ruleset to trammel because they had no interest in pvp and i was sick of dealing with random nutjobs that go from one pvp server to the next just to cause as much consternation as they could until they were banned. i wasn't the only server that had a problem with these people.eventually i handed all code and data to the germans and pulled my hands off it all. they managed to get it to work but i don't think it survived for long."
5/1/2010,"goodness, another lie from you, this time with the partial quote.did you post what was quoted that you snipped out? that you decided you didn't want pvpers?what about the fact that eve isn't a real sandbox according to you?what about your statement that you feel implementation of custom clothing should take priority over ship balance and lag issues?remember the wonderful crap you've spouted in corp chat, there are logs a plenty floating about that show what a lie most of your campaign is.so, once more, i say, go play with your crayons and leave eve to the people who actually play it and care about it."
5/1/2010,after a looong background check on your view of how eve online should be changed i guarantee 1000% you wont receive my vote.

5/1/2010,needs a bump. go issler! :)
5/1/2010,"thanks, issler. well answered, mostly, even if a bit vague in some points. and, you sort of fell for the bs statement (the one i totally disagree with - guess which one it is) but even though you didn't disagree to it outright, at least you didn't agree to it either. one may go too far in avoiding to alienate potential voters, you know... ;)"
5/1/2010,"thanks for some good questions. i tried to get some response up quickly and also to avoid terminal tl;dr which can limit answer sizes. in some cases i don't really have an ""answer"", just an opinion. in cases like that what i tend to like is to have a more involved discusssion with larger audiences. i think as a csm you need to remember you are representing the eve community at large, not just your own viewpoints.if i had to guess which one you put in to ""test"" me i'd guess ""strength in numbers"". :-)again, thanks for an opportunity to let folks learn more about what i think. i definitely hope other folk will offer some other questions!issler dainzeyour next csm representative!"
5/1/2010,"with respect, i disagree, if for no other reason than while you can hide intent from the game, you can't hide your actions, and you can infer intent from the action. if fleets a, b and c are all red to each other, and a and b are both shooting at c but not each other, you can infer what's really going on (and yes, before you object, i know that this too can be gamed. that isn't the point, the point is that you can make inferences from behavior. a real game-mechanic that implements this is going to be more subtle)while there is an arms-race aspect to this (i should know about arms-races, i was on the front lines of the first copy-protection war, and wrote the first anti-virus program for the mac), with careful thought it should be possible to introduce some gameplay changes that make the costs of being ""tricky"" and gaming the mechanic outweigh the benefits after a certain point. and that has to be better than the current situation, where the major trick is ""bring more guys"".let us turn the discussion around for a moment, for purposes of illustration. which of the following represents your position, and why?1) lag cannot be fixed, ever.2) lag can be fixed without any significant gameplay changes. if so, why?3) lag can be fixed by gameplay changes. if so, which ones do you think are interesting?it should be clear by now i'm in category-3. which are you?"
5/1/2010,"in principle, #2 is clearly correct. there is clearly some level of server performance that could handle any conceivable fleet fight without significant lag. to go all reductio ad absurdum, imagine if ccp invested in a reinforced node for every single node in the game. in practice, of course, this would be fantastically expensive and it won't happen, but in principle it'd solve lag quite handily. as for gameplay changes to solve lag, i think you're aiming at the wrong objective. you're trying to eliminate laggy fleets, which is simply impossible to do with any sort of sane changes. an arms race is appropriate for a virus scanner, where the activity you're trying to stop is actually bad. but you shouldn't seek to get into an arms race with your own customers. what you should focus your gameplay changes towards is not ""killing lag"", which is a patently unrealistic goal. aim for increasing the spectrum of non-laggy activities for combat. this is basically the long-discussed small gang objective. killing lag won't happen, but giving people options for avoiding it can."
5/1/2010,how would you fix supercaps in lowsec
5/1/2010,viper get banned from the foramz again?
5/1/2010,"in my view supercarriers in low-sec are fine. they are indeed hard to kill, but no harder than killing them in nullsec; in many cases it is easier to kill them in low-sec. in fact, i was checking out some numbers the other day and i'm fairly certain that since the ~supercarrier~ boost there have been more losses in low-sec than in 0.0. what i do think should be reconsidered is the use of titan doomsday weapons in low-sec. i think this would result in more titans being used, and more importantly more titans dying.a good question~"
5/1/2010,"what is your opinion on mods like shield flux coils and autotargetors.i haven't decided if i'm voting for you yet, but from all the candidates on this forum, you appear to be the most knowledgeable and honourable."
5/1/2010,my vote has been bought and paid for by cat for cat!!!yay cat!!
5/1/2010,"once again,who is your main?"
5/1/2010,"uhm, not that i want to sh*t up your thread specifically, but you hit a pet peeve of mine (that's the risk you take when you quote philosophy quotes i guess)you're grossly misunderstanding the core of nietzsches' philosophy in your opening statement (incidentally, your representation is most commonly know as the national-socialist* interpretation, take that as you will *godwin*) to keep it simple, despite how that quote might sound to you, it's not an argument for social-darwinism in any form, quite the contrary, most anyone who have taken a freshman course in philosophy or has take more than a glancing look at modern continental philosophy could tell you this. *(forum wont let me use the ""n"" word, the political n word, the fascism n word, not the racial slur n word)anyway, with that out of the picture, i'd just say that trading has been my main income (along with some production stuff), and if the way you do it is in any way ""risky"" (in the sense that you might actually lose more than you invest) you're doing it wrong. it's risky in the same way that level 4 missioning is.. if you make a stupid mistake, it might cost you your 1bn isk pve-pwnboat, but in overall terms it's not."
5/1/2010,"you wrote this on the premise that i haven't studied philosophy. ;) his concept of overman is social-darwinism in its finest. if you don't agree with this, then... well, probably your interpretation of his works differs somehow from mine. if you want to discuss this further, you can send me in-game mail, because i don't think that this forum is right place for such discussions. if you are not risking anything while trading, you will have just a small income, comparable somehow to level 1-3 missions. but if you want to make big money, you need to start evaluating market and speculating on the price. and there comes the risk."
5/1/2010,"i have revised my proposal to hopefully clarify my goals and to avoid any unintentional pre-balancing. it can be reviewed here or above.thank you comds for those kind words.thank you tyrion for voicing your concerns to me, i have taken what you have said to me about my campaign under advisement.i personally don't see my goals as too far out of reach, as a member of the csm it would be enough to have ccp and the other members of the csm to agree to any of my proposals and then see where it goes from there, that is all you can ask of any of the hopefuls running. one of my main goals which has been singled out is a long term one, is to improve the pos system in eve. the idea i have proposed could provide the a good system that is easy to use and provide the facilities players want from starbases, as well as providing added game play opportunities by giving small gangs targets to go after. it is probably one of the easiest to achieve out of the other proposals i have seen. it could be based on existing code and relatively few models need to be created for it. also the recent change giving players the ability to build starbases would not be lost, as the structures could become starbase modules.i just want to represent the best interests of the player community of eve and i hope you all think that i am the person to do it. please vote for me."
5/1/2010,"thank you for the response. i really appreciate your take on the transferable kill rights. i like the idea of them being contracted out.mostly i appreciate your thoughtful answer. you are polling very well in the noobs-retlok-brought-to-the-game voting bloc, for what it's worth."
5/1/2010,"i've been lucky enough to fly with both of these people. in my experience, both are dedicated, driven, informed (and balanced!), and smart enough to listen when that is whats required.confirming that votes for tea and mynxee will benefit all of eve."
5/1/2010,so here's a sample of my blog posts on the subject of eve game design so you can get an idea of my standing on a number of issuesthe folly of relying on side effects - why local chat as an intel source needs to be replaced with a proper game mechanic.my prizewinning blog banter entry on tyrannis including a section on how some small changes can add new pve and pvp opportunities to the game.things ccp could do to help the mineral markets - prior to the official dev blog on the insurance changes this was a speculation on the kind of changes that would help stop mineral prices cratering and making everyone except the macros quit mining.

5/1/2010,eve tribune interview that was conducted last week.
5/1/2010,"nice website as always.dominion was supposed to attract more people to 0.0(just like exodus), obviously didn't. what do you think can be done to get more people to move out of empire space?"
5/1/2010,"what are your views on the amount of communication - devblogs, forum announcements, new features pages etc - that ccp provides? (setting aside tutorials etc, as you stated above that improving documentation could be one area to improve...)"
5/1/2010,"ccp is working on the lag impact brought on by dominion. they have been hosting test sessions on singularity though to gather data. what they're doing behind the scenes, ii don't know. csm5 will no doubt ask for an update during the first summit coming up in june. only ccp knows the answers to these questions since they have the accurate data. players can only speculate. i believe that the impact of fighter bombers on pos modules needs to be looked at by ccp. it'll be something i'll bring up (along with other csm, no doubt.)"
5/1/2010,"i'd be willing to bring it up for a vote and see what ccp would be willing to do. perhaps tabs could be created and a menu system added that is similar to how you setup an overview. ""only show: blueprint originals"" i would like to see special hotkeys for drone control become a reality along with an even better ui for using them.i'd make the suggestion and try to gather numbers to show ccp that the players want more videos."
5/1/2010,"thank you for the compliment, ratnose. :)better documentation of what life in 0.0 entails for one. no-one wants to go out in 0.0 without knowing how the mechanics of that area work because they may risk losing everything they own. and i'm concerned about how the addition of treaties will impact 0.0 living. sure, it'll bring people out but it'll strengthen power blocks even more. you won't have combat going on like it should in 0.0 but rather constellations/regions of people playing simeve."
5/1/2010,"having played this game for over 5 years i have seen it change completely and not always for the best. as the ceo of outbreak i represent a unique focus, an independent focus, free from alliance influence. eve is slowly turning black and white and losing its variety, but this does not represent the true nature of the game we love. a vote for me isn't a vote for the carebear agenda, it isn't a vote for the alliance agenda. it is a vote for the third way: a return to the true essence, blowing s**t up and having fun. the main focus of my term will be pushing forward the heart of this game, the pvp element, and making sure that fights happen more often and not less.some of the issues i want to address:ccp needs to write down the role of each ship/ship class in the game and what concept they want to do with it. this needs to be reviewed every expansion to see whether the role is gimped or overpowered with the new features (case in point dramiel/tempest/black ops)introduce a fast balancing cycle for ships once a month. this is for smaller stat changes that do not need to be included in expansions. (changes to modules, guns, bonuses)introduce ways to make eve more regional again (rebalance range of jump ships or cost per jump, etc.)change the current aggro timer to include mass of the ship aggressed ships cannot be stored inside a carrierecm nerfold cyno effect yay \o/vote for alpha vote for pewpew"

5/1/2010,"the csm doesn't have the power to tell ccp what to do -- and quite frankly, it shouldn't.what csm does have is a privileged position -- they are under nda and so know more about the game's internals (both technical and political) than most of the players. this gives them a unique perspective.what csm should be, imho, is a filter between the players and ccp, looking at player requests and moulding the best ones into proposals that have a serious business case for implementation. it's clear from this and other threads that this is the way csm has been evolving, but i think improvements can be made.csm can't make something happen -- but it can make a persuasive argument as to why something should happen. and that argument boils down to ""ccp, if you do this, you will make more money, and here is why"""
5/1/2010,"let me tell you exactly what i think you can accomplish as a csm and the approach i took and will continue to take. ccp has lots of folks focused full time on making eve better. they already have strong opinions about where they want eve to go. the csm can adjust those opinions and views with their interactions with ccp. what the csm can't do is dictate what goes in eve. so the csm can infuence but not dictate. the ability to influence is a result of a lot of factors. the csm members apparent understanding of eve as it has evolved, how much the csm member ""gets it"" (for example csm members that want to fundementally nerf pvp will never get taken seriously because ccp clearly made a game all about shooting strangers in the face in space). the csm members ability to make a logical case for their suggestions. the csm members understanding of the technical issues and realities of software engineering and game development when presenting their ideas. for example it can be the funnest ever idea but if it can't be implemented in our life time it won't get considered.i also think the process to influence happens as much outside the meetings as inside the meetings. so an effective csm needs to be opportunistic in finding opportunities to interaact with the ccp team during their term.in summary, i think the csm can be thought leaders but cannot be expected to be able to force anything into eve. the ability to have credibility with ccp as a member of the csm can come from a lot of places. affiliation with a large player block. a history of showing some great insite into how eve works and can evolve. a history of taking a mature and ""big picture"" approach with solid understadning of the realities of software engineering and game development. these all contribute in ccp taking a particular csm member seriously and listening to their ideas.so any csm that is running making a claim that they'll be the one that makes ccp fix the lag is confused about the limits of the csm and also confused thinking ccp isn't already trying to do that as much as possible. also any csm that suggests radical changes in the factors that make eve such a successful sandbox (for example trying to seriously increase the penalty for initiating non-concensual pvp) is going to get largely ignored by ccp.with the new inclusion of the csm in the agile methods in use at ccp having a csm member that has direct experience with the processes in place at ccp will be a bonus too. i've been driving agile process based development teams for the last 8 years so i am one of the csm candidates this term that can claim direct experience with the process.so look for csm candidates that you think will have cedibility with ccp and that understand that their roles are as ""thought leaders"" and not ""dictators"" in evolving eve.issler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate"
5/1/2010,"that was exactly my point as well. to implement aa is a really good idea, but ccp has rejected many 'technical' suggestions of times past.hell, it's indeed 'little' enough that its worth a try again, worst that can happen is they say no again, best that can happen is they pick it up."
5/1/2010,"sorry.this isn't even on the front page of things i'm trying to fix.vote against me if you want.but most of the times i'm in fleet fights, the red ""ships"" i'm against are so scrolled out that unless aa effects little ""x""-like boxes - not an issue."
5/1/2010,eve has always been a great looking game and adding things to help it use the latest video cards to there fullest is something i would bring up for myself as well as too if its something we would have any control over that i dont know. :pi feel that eve still uses the cpu way too much i 4 box most of the time and the load of my video is next to nothing but it does push my overclocked dualcore kinda hard. :pinstitute.
5/1/2010,"a major ui overhaul is in the works and i think the next csm will have to await what ccp has already cooked up before they can provide feedback, but it's always a good idea to gather suggestions. you can expect every but of support and pushing from me in that direction."
5/1/2010,"yes, this is not top priority ofc. and yes, i also zoom out during fleet fights. but fleet fights, even though they are the more exciting part of the game, only last about 15% of my gametime, maybe less. most of the time i will be ratting, etc. and there i would like my ship not to look jaggyish. every major game released from 2006 has anti aliasing. the fact that eve does not, is stupid. yeah, it would take ccp some effort to implement it, not any more effort then any other game company has put into there product. can't see why can't ccp put in the same effort ea and crytec did into there games.thanks to all the candidates that have responded, nice to know your opinions on this matter."
5/1/2010,"probably worded better than i could have. i'm pretty much oppose almost everything that has been typed by her, and she's fun to antagonize to boot.but i still have things to offer carebears considering voting for her. i've always been opposed to a straight up highsec lvl 4 mission nerf, because i think that's bad for the overall game when you alienate an entire group of people who generally do not organize together to give themselves a voice. i also have some pro-missioning proposals of my own and have never voted against issues that are pro-carebear(assuming they don't have other glaring flaws that would harm the overall game or could be abused). afterall, in order to look for targets to shoot, it's really hard to do it if there aren't lots of happy carebears everywhere.even if you don't want to vote for me, and you want to vote for a pro-empire player candidate, i'd urge you not to vote for ankhsdfadsaf. just pick someone else, at least pick someone who knows how the game works."
5/1/2010,"yup, this is one of the things i'd like to see. they could even warp out, repair, then come back in."
5/1/2010,nope.but as you may have read . . . this is about getting in people who in the future may become real pvp types. they don't just grow on trees btw.let the noob's come in and begin to like the game. then introduce them to the hardships of eve through lvl 3's and 4's and 5's and the potential gankers . . . . and come to let them love the pvp aspects of the game . . . . and then out to lowsec or null-sec they come. seems a natural ascendancy to me.and do the rest of the people commenting here not understand how to increase the number of players in this game? that is what ccp and us care about after all no?i want more pvpers long term. lowsec or nullsec. don't you?
5/1/2010,"not sure i'm following you here... are you in favor of reducing the risk of hostile unwanted pvp encounters and loot theft for beginning players or eliminating the possibility altogether? please elaborate how you'd like to protect the noobs, as you're describing in your above posts."
5/1/2010,for the 1 day to 3 week noobs - yes . . . . let's protect them somehow from the nasty 6 month to 3 year gankers. what thrill do the gankers really get in this anyway against noobs? wonkers really imo.once the newer guys get a sense of how things work . . . . release them to the world of eve. who knows? maybe they get a taste for things and become pirates after being pirated or become real 0.0 fighters after being fought.we need new blood in this game and new guys are just that.but until they get a sense of how / where / when things are done . . . yeah i'm for keeping them interested in the game. even if that means keeping them isolated as they run their level 1 and 2 missions.believe me - i love pvp (lookie here or here ) - but there is a place and time for it.thanks for the opportunity to clarify my position good sir!
5/1/2010,"mazz posted a really nice suggestion about that in the ah last week - competitive missioning where you will not only be fighting npc's but also competing with other players over victory of the mission, among other things. something along those lines would be awesome imo.i have run lvl 4's in highsec some time ago, and i find that the isk/hr numbers posted are generally a bit inflated as a lot of time is lost in between of shooting npc's by warping, moving, docked etc. i agree however that the introduction of a steeper gradient in terms of potential-isk-by-system-sec-status would be desirable and can also be used as a mechanic, in conjunction with planetary interaction, to make lowsec more attractive.wormhole space was a great step in this direction - and general npc ai has been on the backlog for a long time so it should receive some attention from ccp eventually. if there is high demand however, a proposal can of course be drafted and i would be glad to assist there."
5/1/2010,"i don't agree that giving new players some sorta world of warcraft protective fuzzy coat of kindness is a good thing. i do think that there is some serious work that needs done for the npe, but one of the key fundamental aspects of the npe needs to be death and loss. if players are not killing them then they have to encounter loss of their ships from npc's quickly, first day. and often. this can be coupled with easy replacements for those losses, but losses need occurred non-the-less.we want people in eve that understand that a ship is just a temporary replaceable tool and it's loss is expected. we don't want idiot wow players who sit around and play missions and put _all_ their earned money into more expensive mods on their ship and when they ultimately loose it they've lost all they've worked for for sometimes years and rage quit. by isolating new players from any meaningful loss or unwanted pvp initially your only setting up circumstances where players are more likely to think loss is bad, this is not the way to learn eve.this game needs less hand holding and more death in the npe. so i firmly disagree with your proposed idea."
5/1/2010,"while as a csm candidate i must disagree with you (as in the candidates have to consider every possible game style) - personally, if you weren't from an alliance red to mine . . . . i'd love to have you as a recruiter for my corp!"
5/1/2010,"i've already been in your corp, no thanks. and personally, i think you'd be much better off not in your corp, as would everyone else currently in it (that goes for the whole alliance)."
5/1/2010,"from what i understand, in the new ""advanced combat"" rookie career missions, they send you to low-sec and tell you to going to lose your ship. in fact, if i remember correctly, i think one mission is specifically to lose your ship or get podkilled or something.so in a way, player are introduced to this early, which is nice.anyway, i agree with your post. i've talked to people who play wow who are interested in sci-fi and seemed semi-interested in eve, but they say ""i heard you lose everything when you die"". i tried to explain that you don't lose everything unless everything you own is in/on your ship, which you don't do, but i wasn't sure i was getting through. i agree that players need to be introduced to risk and the golden rule of eve (don't undock with anything you can't afford to lose) early on, and if they can't hack it, well, eve isn't for everyone."
5/1/2010,locked at op's request
5/1/2010,"ever since i started playing the game in 2006, i've never liked the ui and the lack of control that i have over it. what are some of your thoughts on how to over come this on a personal and corporation level? also, what do you think about a more public option that ccp can take as for keeping it's users in the loop about what bugs are being fixed, in what priority are they being handled, and just an overall appropriate time frame for those issues to be fixed."
5/1/2010,"w're an anarcho-syndacalist commune! we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer of the week. by decisions of that officer, must be ratified by a majority, or in the case of a foreign affair, a two-thirds majority!(if i called myself a king because some watery tart lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!)"
5/1/2010,i see what you did there
5/1/2010,"honestly, i don't care who pays for the airline ticket: while i can pay my own way, i hate flying (at least a jet - prop jobs i'm fine with) and it doesn't matter to me who is paying for hours on a bloody jet. it's going to s**k either way.but it would be interesting to see who would sign up for csm though if the flight and booze were not covered."
5/2/2010,"dear ccp, incase u worried that u have forgot to implement something, bumpies/hemmops: i know your wathing this section of the forumspss: someone got more great idea's, spam them here and give slow old grumpy ccp a hand"
5/2/2010,"tired of being unable to hit targets for the first half of fights...they need range, give them that."
5/2/2010,"like goum said, the dps is not everything in fleets. those who thinks dps is everything is basicly a noob when it's about pvp and fleet fights.peoples today looks at eft and looks at how much dps each ships does. and then goes omg, the rokh / tempest sucks donkey balls because the dps on them sucks compared to other ships.but i'm sorry to tell you this, but ehp and speed and how agile your ship is is very important in fleet fights to.why do you think i choose a tempest over a maelstrom in those big fleet fights we have?. it's because it's way faster and quite alot more agile than the maelstrom. yes my tempest is shield tanked. so it's not getting slow because of armor plates and that.the maelstrom with the setup we use here only have 8-9k more ehp and 500-600 more alpha than the tempest. but those extra 8-9k ehp and 500-600 more alpha is not worth it over how much faster and how much more agile the tempest is over the maelstrom.once you get bubbled, then you need to get out of those bubbles rather quickly if you want to survive.the tempest also do more dps than the maelstrom inside 84 km. because the tempest with 6 guns with the skills at level 5 included is the same as 7.5 guns, while the maelstrom have 8 guns. but the reason the tempest do more dps inside 84 km is because it can fit 2x hml's to.so i'll say not supported."
5/2/2010,"clearly guomingdong (or wahtever) lives in a fantasy world where you can maneouver and react realistically in fleet fights. practically speaking, what happens in a fleet fight is you bring the most dps you can because if you're primaried, you're dead in 30 seconds and that's assuming you even load grid before you get podded.all the fleet fights i've ever participated in have had the bubble usually collapse before my client has registered its even there due to lag. also lol for fitting hml in a fleet :p*additional*forum 5 minute posting delay sucks."
5/2/2010,"to the first thing. well, i haven't had any problems to load grid even in those big fleet fights we have. yes it takes a little time to load the grid. but once your in the grid and fighting, then it can be good to have a fast and agile ship if you get bubbled.and to the last thing. what would you fit on a sniper fitted tempest instead then when you have exactly 624,75 powergrid left if you take the 2x hml's away from my tempest. would you fit a lrar / lst instead that would be used maybe 2% out of the 100% your in a fight instead of using the hml's that can be used like 50% out of 100% in a fight?, since you can hit smaller targets like dictors and frigs and those kind of ships."
5/2/2010,totally agree
5/2/2010,"who are you responding to?also, in a fleet fight, one of the participants is likely to be where he wants. even if you cannot determine which one that will be, you can still design fleets around the practice of being where you want to be better than your enemy.if you're in a situation where ehp does not matter then dps does not matter. and i find it funny that you claim that ehp doesn't matter in situations where you can't shoot backany time any ship on your side is getting targeted and shot or attacked with any weapon, ehp matters. sometimes ehp matters less than other things, sometimes more. survivability and effectiveness optimization depend mainly on the predicted call order your opponent will be using. in situations where you know you're going to be called first, you're better off with more survivability, ditto dps if you're called last. this assumes you opponent is rational and is calling in a manner that generally attempts to take as much effectiveness out of the fight as quickly as possible.but, within ship types, there is no way to differentiate between any two pilots except meta knowledge (for instance if you know some pilot always goes full gank, or if you know your enemy likes to call alphabetically by name, a first), and because of this, efficient fits within ship types are homogeneous unless there is meta-knowledge involved*. any pilot in an apoc has the same chance as anyone else of getting called and so whatever method you're using to determine where on the ehp/dps spectrum you design will always land in the same place for each ship.over an entire fleet of ships this reduces down to maximizing the combination of survivability and effectiveness. this is the only place where outgoing damage is maximized and each ship has the same fit. with both dps and ehp as important as the other and when this is done for all long range snipers(i.e. 190km snipers) the rokh is the clear winner (efficient apoc is 312 dps w/ 98k ehp @ 190km, rokh is 321 dps w/ 126k ehp @ 190km)*sometimes it can be efficient for both parties to fit against meta-knowledge and for the people using that calling heuristic to use it. if for instance the losses derived from calling ships inefficiently and hitting super-tanked ""a names"" is overcome by the ease of target calling this can still be a solution for both parties.edit: for more information, please see this section of this post."
5/2/2010,strange those ships don't have the option yet would it be overpowerd if a carrier is able to rep all its drones in one triage cycle (5 minute cycle) cause let's face it you can't deploy drones in those 5 minutes and you do have super awesome repairing abilities. dunno how it would get implemented in motherships (maybe rightclick or wathever)
5/2/2010,this +1edit: take it a little step further by having the ship orbit the direction your mouse is facing. ex. if your mouse is on the right side of the screen have the ship start orbiting in that direction once you pressed the orbit shortcut.
5/2/2010,gotta support this one i want to switch from cloacky bubble runner to full gank at a pos.ccp has stated that it is impossible tough because if one subsystem is missing it isn't a complete ship and the game rejects it with a pod in it but wathever.i wouldn't mind if you had to put your t3 into some kind of factory and then after a 30 minute cycle you can take it out and off you go in your now truly modular internet spaceship
5/2/2010,"i am now starting charity fund which will be used to purchase t2 bpo's and then trash them. please send your donations in support of this cause to russel trish.thank you in advance for your support. no seriously those who wish to see t2 bpo's gone should put their money where their mouth is, purchase the t2 bpo from its rightfull owner and then trash it. this way the owners are fairly compensated since if it wasnt a fair offer the owner will not sell the t2 bpo.i have nothing againts t2 bpo but hey if you send me your isk you can rest assured that when enough isk is accumlated you can scratch 1 t2 bpo from the game. on video for all to see. actually i'm serious now....or let someone else do this, would be interesting i think.stop whining about t2 bpo's and do something about it!!! lets buy them all and then trash the mofo's!"
5/2/2010,"well if invention is so superior, then scrapping the bpos wouldn't be such a big issue now would it? rid eve of them."
5/2/2010,"hi, i am a pvper.i have invention alts and i made enough money with invention to buy several t2 bpos, but i don't want to because they are terrible.they can't scale like invention and it takes years to come out even.apparently, you are unaware of how fast people were getting rid of them back in the lottery. too much effort for the reward, it's not an isk printing machine.t2 bpos are easy to acquire, just have a look at the sell orders subforum.if they are so awesome, why don't you just buy a few of them? is it because you are poor and want to prevent others from having things you can't afford? or is it because they aren't worth the money?the answer is both.edit: i forgot to mention that t2 bpos were a terrible idea and should never have been implemented, but it is now too late to fix that (same as learning skills). invention made t2 production ""fair"" and t2 bpos are an investment like any other (probably the worst thing to ever invest money in, unless you get a huge bargain)."
5/2/2010,"very simple. it is possible to repackage cans and ships through assets, why not be able to stack all assets in a location (station, deliveries, corp hangar) with a right click option too?all in favour please vote"
5/2/2010,i am of course in favour
5/2/2010,"remote asset management has gotten better, but there's still a few things i'd like. this is one of them."
5/2/2010,wow finally something useful from lilan +1
5/2/2010,"erm, wish i coud say the same"
5/2/2010,not supported
5/2/2010,"once a again, no."
5/2/2010,"removed trolling comments. this is a place for everyone to share their ideas. you may come across an idea that has been stated before and/or don't like. there is no need to troll each other. if you don't support it a simple ""do not support"" will suffice."
5/2/2010,uh no. bombs are in fact not overpowered.not supported.
5/2/2010,"while i see where you want to go, then there should still be a boundary on what kind of stupid ideas you want to share. i mean, do you honestly think this topic / idea is good when you see how emo tj have written it and what it's all is about?. i really hope that you say it's not a good idea.like this emo tj guy, he just say bawwwww, bombers are overpowered just because he say so. and only because he was spanked very hard by some bombers then he comes here to whine and cry about that bombers are overpowered, while they are not.he doesn't even have a single reason that the bombers are overpowered. see what i mean?. the only reason is that he got spanked by some bombers and don't like them.and if you have seen his other topics in this forum section, then i think that should give you a gooooooood idea that the only thing he's doing here is to cry / whine for a nerf only because it doesn't goes his way.do you see now why we want this guy out of this forum section?.now, i still don't support really really stupid ideas. so not supported."
5/2/2010,supported because nightmarex is a moron.
5/2/2010,"not supported because you haven't bothered to present any reasons of why bombs are overpowered. the ""everyone knows"" isn't an argument or a reason, it's an assumption. obviously everyone doesn't know, or they'd be flocking in this thread to support it.so explain why you think they're overpowered or let this thread, like your other horrible ideas of late, die.not supported."
5/2/2010,"interesting. i did not in fact know that bombs are overpowered, and this thread has done nothing to convince me that they are. if you find that you're being waylaid by flights of bombers dropping waves of bombs... well good on them for practicing like that!of course, not supported.-liang"
5/2/2010,"sorry, but i have to lol very hard at you.first of all, your supporting the most stupid idea ever in eve's history and then your calling me a moron?, hahahaha.and secondly, your supporting this because emo tj is an nc alt and you are in the nc to, so your just want to support your bff player in nc.nice going there pal. i mean, your starting to look good here i must say."
5/2/2010,"um... excuse me? but, have you ever flown a stealth bomber? if you have, then you know that if another ship simply breathes on it, it will pop.the stealth bomber also has the distinction of being the only ship that can be killed by its own weapon.not supported."
5/2/2010,bombs are the only viable method to counter close range rr blobs. a smart blob can counter them with spreading out and making bombs less effective. that said ... bomber/bombs have a viable counter. no need to nerf them.not supported.
5/2/2010,while i am quite active in the assembly hall i have only once read the minutes for one of the csm meetings. tbh i have no idea how often meetings happen and don't even really know where to look for the minutes.i don't think i should even have to look. i want to see a news item when i log into eve for every time minutes are released.i also want more news items in general. but don't really know how to make that happen.
5/2/2010,"they go to iceland every six months, and have online meetings with ccp every two. the csm has their own meetings every week or two usually, but those are their meetings with ccp. as for the issue at hand, yeah, the communication sucks. this seems like a nice addition to the process."
5/2/2010,supported.
5/2/2010,"there needs to be a happy medium between the hunted and the hunter. taking away local skews things too much in favor of the hunter.if removing local is the only change made then it allows the hunter to scan and probe when and as leasurely as he pleases, while someone doing any pve activity will have to do it all the time he is out. and making eve a game about spamming a button in order to not get ganked is just wrong.and no, having a bigger blob isn't the solution either. this plan needs to be complete. it can't be some half-worked-up plan that only favors the hunters and screws the hunted. it needs to be balanced before we even consider voting on it."
5/2/2010,"if you were to remove local then the game needs to provide a intel tool to replace it, and unfortunately directional scan is not it.my thoughts on that matter is the core probe launcher would be the best tool for a replacement intel tool.use the core launcher to launch multiple probes within system that would detect any ship (cloked/visble) within its sphere radius. that information is then relayed back to your scanner window to display player and ship class (frig/cruiser/bc/bs/capital). provide a limited active time same with standard probes so they have to be refreshed every 1-2 hours.that opinion would be a good solution, as it would give active pilots the tools to protect them selves, and provide a bane to the macro ratters.and as an added benefit would provide a limited tool for the detection of cloaked ships but not the ability of precisely locating them.ie cloaky ship not moving out of range of a 0.25 au probe is less of a threat that one popping between multiple probe locations.my final thought would be to provide a rank 1/2 skill for this new probe system so you could limit the amount of probes in space, and possibly use the other supporting probe skills to define the extent of information you receive back.a quick supplement to this would be also allow the ship scanner (30 sec delay might need to be reduced?) to be able to do a ""ping"" to see if there is anything within your immediate vicinity as a counter to cloaked dictors etc as the major impact of a probe based intel system is a massive buff to the tactic of a cloaked dictor on gate."
5/2/2010,supported.w-space proved the concept.
5/2/2010,"and u wonder why ppl evade so many fights, making u have to roam 99% of your time... it's 'cause before it ""starts"", everyone knows the other side will stack so many odds (fleet size) against them. honestly, do u think ppl will just fly blind, right into a bubble blob? no, they won't. they'll just avoid 0.0 altogether, leaving u with nothing to ez gank. and if u actually thought they would, then i grossly overestimated u, 'cause here's a tip: other players r not mindless rats with names..."
5/2/2010,"i'm a fan of delayed local, since i believe that nothing about gathering intel should be easy. not a fan of eve played in lazy mode. intel is a vital resource and you should have to work to get it. however, i support bell's proposal only with a caveat that something better replaces the current d-scanner. orb lati's ideas earlier in this thread about adapting current probe mechanics are appealing. perhaps with deep safes being nerfed, deep space probes could be given an intel gathering capability.even though i adore my cov ops ships, i like the idea of a probe that can report info about cloaky ships. but only how many are within range of the probe, not their type or location. just a count. any such probe should be short-range and require a special skill to use. forcing trade-offs and difficult choices about what to train is something i favor."
5/2/2010,what you just said ...
5/2/2010,"at first i thought this might not be a good idea, but then last week i got caught in a queue for the bathroom and then got called by my boyfriend (i'm gay). in the meantime, i was sitting using my 60 seconds of cloak time in lowsec, and unfortunately i got back 1 second too late :(:( rip my mining bantam. that people should be allowed to grief like this is ridiculous in modern times. something must be done"

5/2/2010,"he tries a bit too hard with ""cloak of invisibility""."
5/2/2010,imho opinion low sec piracy is an essential element of keeping eve exciting fun frustrating and challenging as are mercenary corps/alliances etc. however those who prey on noobs by can baiting flipping and suicide ganking in high sec are more of a sympton of a dangerous thing in mmorpg the boredom that comes from mediocrity.
5/2/2010,"this is being featured in the next expansion, you also received a newsletter explaining the changes, piracy goes against the eula as it is direct greifing.while your idea isnt fully implemented there is a lite version being made here"
5/2/2010,simple fix: get rid of the ball-&-chain (i.e. gf) = profit!
5/2/2010,"this is absolutly not a trollthread.punishing pirates in game is not enough, i think they should pay more than $15 per month for eve.also, they should pay more taxes irl."
5/2/2010,"this is possibly the worst idea i've ever heard since ""make pirates pay for game time in human test ticles"""
5/2/2010,this is a terrible idea and would probably end up killing the game. all the carebears crying about losing ships to accidently going into losec or losing them to suicide ganks in empire well those are all avoidable just by actually using your brain. if you dont want to use your brain well thats your problem. carebear tears are so funny when their so ill thought out.

5/2/2010,"while we are at it, lets just slap on a covert ops cloak to every ship we think is broken as a solution to fixing it. right?..."
5/2/2010,thats dumb.they are terrible atm. they need a considerable boost. imo covert ops cloak and jump range bigger than a carrier. covert ops cloak just means that it has a chance of getting out of a gate camp. imagine uncloaking a arazu b4 it warps from a gate.... very possbile. uncloaking a bs before it warps easy! still would be very killable. gangs would actually use the covert jump portal as ccp meant it!
5/2/2010,question is: why use the normal gates for a ship that has a jump drive?!cloak -> wait for covert cyno -> jump to it?
5/2/2010,"don't really support this. they simply need a buff to ehp (atleast as good as t1 ffs) and jump range. that alone is enough. alternatively they could be made into uber recons, but that involves dumping current ship bonuses and starting over, save for the widow which already is an uber-ish recon."
5/2/2010,supporting the op
5/2/2010,filthy amarrians for getting free t1 ammo and instachanging ammo. faction and t2 ammo is very annoying if you want to use it but.... no support. caaaaallllllllmmmmmmmm!
5/2/2010,yes because it makes perfect sense to deliberately make the game interface extremely frustrating to large portions of the player base. this isn't exactly an issue of game balance - its an issue of game usability.-liang
5/2/2010,"i'll support this when lasers aren't so overpowered compared to blasters. until then, i just see it as the *only* disadvantage of lasers, no matter how dumb.yes, i trained lasers up and use them constantly. why doesn't everyone?"
5/2/2010,yes.
5/2/2010,"as we all know (or most of us anyway), a rorqual has become the mobile refinery for a pos that can warp around and create clones for us. the original design was to create a capital industrial ship to assist in moving ore from nullsec/lowsec to highsec with ease, and to give a booster for miners comparable to a command ship. well now we have the orca, replacing the need for the booster side of the rorqual (to an extent), however to those desperate enough, they will still spend a few billion isk to get a mobile compression unit. i ask what the point is of a rorqual anymore. sure, we can compress ore to move large amounts around with small ships, but it just sits in a pos.proposalcreate a new pos array to compress unrefined ore at the cost of fuel and still require compression bpos. it'll still require the same variables as a rorqual but will save some isk and time to those who will more than likely just sit inside a pos with a rorqual anyway."
5/2/2010,buff the rorq by nerfing it? lolso what should all the rorqual pilots do with the months of skills they've trained once you're able to do it at a pos.no thanx.
5/2/2010,so you want the rorqual made completely and totally obsolete. no thanks.
5/2/2010,"i have 5 accounts with numerous toons.one of my accounts (containing a 54mil sp toon) recently got hacked and the person changed the password and reply e-mail address (which precluded me from either logging into the account or requesting a change of password).i raised the first petition in this regard last sunday but have to date (7 days later) not received a single acknowledgement from ccp on this. i have also raised 2 other petitions (to try an elicit a response from ccp) and the only response was from gm sayyah to inform me that one of them was filed under the incorrect category, was moved and will be attended to by another gm.a friend recently experienced a similar problem with a wow account, but this was completely resolved within 48h of him reporting and he was reimbursed for all items lost.the delinquent logs in regularly but blocks all attempts to communicate with him.this lack of action on multiple reports of fraud and general indifference from ccp is shocking. i had to cancel my credit card since it was still tied to the account.does anyone have any guidance to provide on possible next steps?"
5/2/2010,"i say do the following1. make it impossible without a petition to change certain information, like name, e-mail etc and censor the information, only ccp and the customer should know the e-mail. it is actually possible to change your name multiple times too -.- which is really odd imo haha2. security precautions on ip / mac address changes, similar to how banks / wow works, different ip / country / mac = monitored to locked account.3. account profiling and monitoring, back in wow days when i got hacked, one of my chars logged in and spammed 'wts gold' etc, blizzard banned the account until they heard back from me :d4. or for the sake of security make the key chains / authenticators.anyway good luck with your account issues, while i havent ever had to wait more than 2 days for a petition to be answered (even in wow) it is pretty shocking to wait 7 days ;/"
5/2/2010,"this is the assembly hall, it's not for this kind of thing. also, discussing gm correspondance is bad.anyway, hacking takes time for gms to research and follow up. what makes you think that bombarding them with ""i need response naow"" is going to make them work faster. if anything they should shove you to the back of the queue."
5/2/2010,would love to hear your comment if the shoe was on the other foot and it was your banking details on the open market or your hard earned ships / equipment being sold the intention of my initial post was to raise awareness and prevent this kind of aberrant behaviour from affecting other players enjoyment of the game. i agree with the proposed stricter measures for changes to accounts.i don't think it is outside the realm of reasonability to expect gm follow-up / research of reported issues to at least start with a basic confirmation of the reported information by contacting the person filing the petition. this would serve to establish root cause and provide reassurance that the petition is receiving attention.
5/2/2010,first off i do this this is an issue suitable for the assembly hall.at least two players in my corporation have been affected by hacking and lost massive amounts of ships and isk - billions worth. ccp's answer to this was that they won't refund or return any items sold. i also feel fine about gm correpondance being posted here. perhaps if ccp didn't have such a godawful ****ty attitude they wouldn't be so ashamed of having the truth about their second-rate support teams published in public.i understand they want to create a dark and unforgiving universe - but it just seems to be they're creating an arbitrary and malevolent one instead.
5/2/2010,the game masters will be able to address this as soon as possible. you may want to consider updating your petition with all of the account details to expedite the process.
5/2/2010,i agree with the dark and unforgiving universe ... that adds to the appeal of the game. there should however be a clear division between game and real life. some behaviour (such as identity theft) are punishable by law and i should think that ccp as a company can not be seen supporting this.a suggested process for dealing with this kind of petition may be:1) freeze the affected account to avoid any further activity2) reply to initial petition and obtain additional information required to fully investigate the matter3) perform investigation but set clear timelines for resolution of the petition (72h should allow for weekend breaks)4) resolve the issue and permanently block ip to avoid the same person from causing problems in the future5) forward information to authorities (mastercard / visa etc) for further follow-up
5/2/2010,currently the isk from rat bounties comes from nowhere. should it stay that way or should the bounties for rats be more dynamic in nature? perhaps rat bounties could be generated by the isk flowing to npc corps from products like pos's? could we simply get rid of the bounties from npc ships and instead rely on tags to gain the isk when you sell them to npc corps?would another reward be able to take the place of bounties? maybe the players should determine how much isk a rats bounty holds?
5/2/2010,"i would be for this if you include mission rewards.btw, rat bounties are paid by concord, not npc corps."
5/2/2010,"yes, and that is just fine. you see, there has to be somekind of an isk faucet in the game, there can't only be isk sinks else we'd run out of money. if you're suggesting adding tags then i'm suggesting we'll get more powerful tractor beams and that nobody can steal your loot since generally that would be the only way to make reasonable amounts of money, the amount of ninjalooters would certainly skyrocket in every level 3-4 missionhub."
5/2/2010,"well i know the bounties are added by concorde, who in itself is paid for by contributions by all the goverment entities within new eden, (also concorde in its own rights owns space called the concorde assembly which generates isk)then the govermental entities get their isk from tax from inhabitants of planets and us, so no the isk doesnt come from no where"
5/2/2010,i have petition up and no reply

5/2/2010,we will address the petitions in the order they are received in. if you have additional information you are welcome to add it to the current petition. also removed a forum breaking reply
5/2/2010,"cool, it is good to hear you are for the basics of the proposed idea.i do not agree, it does not need to be segregated. however i do agree that it can be segregated during is introduction, in phases in order to make it easier to accept. sort a like the way the new graphics where introduced in phases."
5/2/2010,"this would not stop you from fitting your ship.with a friend joining you in mission running, you can still have your load out just as you want."
5/2/2010,"i enjoy the idea of this, but have maybe a change to the proposal at large - instead of formulating this for all missions, make the changes for level 5 missions only, so they become what they should have been in the first place, gang missions. the fact that 5's just took 4's and added neut towers and placed it all down into lowsec was a dissapointment, but they can still be fixed. another idea would be to make 5's more cap friendly as well, to simply simulate real battles you might face (and even start some in the process)."
5/2/2010,this sounds like a really cool idea. would be cool to have someone tackle and web a really fast npc while a friend applies the dps. and also having to chase them around the system.*i support this but only if they make these types of missions come from separate agents. it will add a little more variety but you'll only do them whenever you feel like it.
5/2/2010,"and this would be something would think a good plan. as it stands, how much fun an l4 is with two persons, i do not wish the duo of scram and point to be a must fit for every non-industrial ship.some missions could warp off, and some would not, some l4's might be limited to af as a max (in gates) some might be limited to cruisers, some might have very strict timers, others might greatly randomize their encounters or change objectives mid-mission, this would all increase diversity, and make things more difficult.generally changing all missions to just fit a select few ships is no solution."
5/2/2010,"which goes back to forcing ppl to fleet (that's what lvl 5s r for), which is less sandboxing and more wow."
5/2/2010,"idk. you can do l3s in a minmatar bc with a full out pvp fit complete with neutralizers and stuff. i used to do them to get lp for faction ammo when i lived in a rss station. being able to get out of the mission and kill something when it shows up on scanner makes it not so mind-bogglingly dull.never ran l4s however - you might want a friend in a interceptor to tackle there (or alt).idk, the idea of having less more intelligent and capable rats which you need to tackle to prevent them from gtfo-ing would probably make it more interesting.i mean, sure, you might not be able to mission in any random failfit, but i don't see that as a bad thing (and l1-l3 would not really be impacted much difficulty wise here)."
5/2/2010,"players identify themself with their corporations and alliances or militia. so it is only natural that they would like to identify themself with their organisations in daily life. just like fan's of (for example) a soccer team like to wear shirts of their favorite teams. being able to do so would improve their sense of community and will have a positive effect on the loyalty of players towards eve. players would probably want to be able to make t-shirts, coffee mugs, stickers and or scale models with their favorite corpo (or alliance) logo's. however,there is no easy way to download the corpo logo. just copying the image makes it very blurry when you blow it up.ccp should make a (digital) version of all corpo logo's available through the eve web site.a variation to this idea could be that ccp would take orders for t-shirts or other merchandise with corpo logo's ( a mini eve amamzon.com) in which players can pay with a credit card or plex.this would enhance the sense of community among players. eve could penetrate in the real world!of course, ccp would have to adjust their website, this might cost them a bit of time from their software engineers"
5/2/2010,after i told you in features & ideas discussion that there is a software for it. did you even try to find it?
5/2/2010,"how about the fact that a bounty hunting system to 'prevent' or deter suicide ganking is really a nerf to miners as well? let's walk you through what would happen...patch goes through with bounty hunting changes, pvpers actively go on bounty hunting sprees, many ships are lost on either side, new ships have to be built, mineral prices go up.deterrence is largely successful as many people are now dissuaded from suicide ganking, previous gankers go to hi-sec missioning for easy money or back to low sec in the rare chance they might gank someone.ship loss is at a low. macro / afk mining at an all time high as there is no ability to to 'combat' this activity outside of bumping them without suffering the wrath of many bored (by then) bounty hunters. more minerals are being brought in then demanded, mineral prices drop to a new low.this is probably the best case scenario from any of your proposed changes. any of your other proposals that don't involve pvp (like bigger or meaningful security hits) would simply deter suicide ganking without filling the ship-loss void created, further driving mineral prices into the ground.so i have to ask, why do you hate miners too?"
5/2/2010,"poor girl, you really have no idea how ridiculous you're making yourself.saying you know about game production when all you have to show for yourself is student projects in which you slapped the title of programmer and designer on yourself.do you realize that a lot of people in here actually are professial programmers? can you see how ridiculous your references actually are?you really need to get the **** out of this game, and leave it to the people who actually care for it."
5/2/2010,"to be fair, she actually is a professional programmer in her own right now, she got hired by some company out of university. doesn't seem to have changed her perspective for the better at all, but it does help to be accurate with your criticism."

5/2/2010,the incredible harshness of sec status hits is proven best by watching all those -10's podding freely through empire and still ganking ppl in hi sec through the use of an orca in a safe spot loaded up with cheap gankboats for example.

5/2/2010,"what risks do you take? you describe yourself as a carebear (risk averse). you trash on pvpers (numerous quotes which you refuse to take responsibility for). you want to nerf anyone who doesn't fit your specific niche. was this a statement, or a confession? hint: we're not here to troll you. we legitimately think you are a bad candidate, and you only further prove our point by pretending that if you call us trolls enough times, all the things you've said (and continue to say) will disappear. if they are really ""out of context"", then by all means, provide context. we're all waiting."
5/2/2010,"the thing is, every time i provided context, it is ignored, and the trolls just repeat the same old statement which has just been proven false, or pick new things from the post, rip those out of context while ignoring that very same context, and write up another troll post. what is the point of answering if noone wants to hear the answer, but are just looking for more fodder for their crapposts?like the ""ankh wants to nerf all pvp"", while there are a zillion posts now that clarify how my standpoints lead to more and better pvp."
5/2/2010,tech 2 damage control in effect. linked post now states so everyone will assume that whatever was in that nearly 4 year old post needed to be edited from history.i am still waiting for an explanation of these two conflicting statements posted to this forum in a single day.i must be a troll because i require candidates to explain contradictions and empty promises.
5/2/2010,"correct, because people do not know the context in which it was posted. it came out of an unmoderated trashforum, for your info. i don't feel the need to be held accountable for something that was posted in jest, which is ripped out of context, like all the 'filthy trolls' have been doing for 8 pages now.it only conflicts if you rip it out of context as partial quotes.as already clarified, in the very same post with you rip quotes from, the csm needs to convince the game designers but also needs to convince ccp from a business perspective, and market their issues. otherwise they remain in the backlog and aren't taken into the scrum sprints.i'll base my decissions on a game design perspective, but when talking to ccp i will do my best to also market the issues."
5/2/2010,qft
5/2/2010,"ehehehe. i managed to catch the post before the edit and i won't relate the jist of it here but yeah, girl's got issues. i do continue to enjoy the branding of anyone with a counter arguement or who has dug up some dirt as a troll. you shouldn't play in the mud if you don't want to get dirty."
5/2/2010,"miss antspankmyankle or wooteveryourcharnameis the way i see it you have some serious issues with the eve-o pvp comunity. you want eve-o to be: -pve based game with people losing 20% of their skills or their entire character for engaging in pvp. -you want eve-o to be your nice little single-player game where your can kill rats to your heart desire and pimp your ships endlessly . -you consider pvpers immoral people, evil people for 'hurting' others through non-consensual pvp. -you cannot make clear,solid distinctions between this game and real life. -you want a permanent seat on the csm to enforce your pve and heavenly eve-o agenda. -you make use of smear campaign on other candidates. -you consider those that actually suport you your pets and mindless minions. -you edit your initial post to hide your little dirty agenda . now the fact of the matter is eve-o is: -it is a game based around non-consensual pvp. -it has one of the greatest mmo comunity i ever seen(minus yourself ) -it gives every player the possibility to make an impact on this fictional universe. -it is a harsh but still fictional world in which most people have fun blowing each other up. -it has one of the longest learning curves out there among mmorpg games. i joined eve-o exactly for that harsh environment, those 'immoral' players as you call them,for the freedom we are given within this fictional world and for the spaceships.tell me why would i ever consider you a worthy representative of the player base when you're trying to ruin this game?"
5/2/2010,stop taking her comments out of context!!!!!
5/2/2010,"thank you for the nice list of misconceptions so i can answer them once and for all.false as proven 3 times already.false, as seen by me focussing on fw and 0.0 issues.depends on the exact type of pvper we're talking about.false.false. i'm against the raising of the term limits as said in the opening post. my 'heavenly eve-o agenda' is making eve better for everyone.false. so far i see a lot of candidates in my thread, and slandering me on forums such as scrapheap and tweakers.net.false exaggeration.false, i added more information."
5/2/2010,i used to not let any of this bother me.i never cared about csm or what happened as long as eve just continued to get bigger and more exciting.however recently that has changed...i have been a pirate and a carebear.i have had officer fits for mission running and participated in the gank.now i must say i dont think ankhesentapemkah is right for this position.please dont vote for someone who wants to gimp people who want to pvp in a pvp game.
5/2/2010,by 'focusing on fw' do you mean running fw missions without ever actually engaging in pvp?
5/2/2010,"ankh, i have a question i'm sure you won't answer because it's a ""troll"", however legitimate it may be.my question: who do you really think you're fooling here? if you don't think we see right through you, you clearly underestimate the intelligence of this community, and it's frankly rather insulting."
5/2/2010,interesting read. as one of the faceless voters out there i can say i will be taking my four votes elsewhere.
5/2/2010,"now, i'm not taking this out of context. you can't spin this. you are a liar. you are not against raising term limits when you are taking advantage of them for another term. if you are against them, put your money where your mouth is, practice what you say you believe. how can anyone trust you when you're already openly violating your own principles?"
5/2/2010,"i can't tell you what all those -10's in hi sec are doing, but there are so many of them moving around freely that it's obvious to even the daftest of ppl that sec status hits aren't that harsh of a punishment. somehow, however, i doubt all those -10's podding through hi sec are there just to adjust there market orders, don't you?"
5/2/2010,"quick question:why do you think you are able to represent '0.0' while you've hardly ever participated in it? as far as i can see all you have done is a few missions and some complexes.you can't make eve better for everybody. if you change something in favor for 1 person, another will have a bad day. now the question is.. who will have the bad day?"
5/2/2010,"or perhaps shortcutting across high sec to get to another area of low or null sec without taking a 40 plus jump route?seriously, you're asserting it's a problem. it's something i've hardly ever seen happening. i normally see -10's around short transit routes or near market hubs...so, yeah, i suspect they are mostly moving or changing orders."
5/2/2010,"you can get positive again in no time, either do it more efficient or just do it for the isk and take the sec status increase as a bonus. but even then it shouldnt take too long.btw, it is just you, you are a paranoid. still would like to have boobies though, ah well, wishfull thinking.you mean dont let people actually pvp? (as with bounties you would get, honestly the larger part of suicide ganking is pve)."
5/2/2010,that entirely depends on what type of 0.0 access you have. it will take ages if you can't get to a spot that allows you to rat in a non-cloaky ship. which is quite punishing imo.ofcourse if you take care of sec hits before you go below -2.0 it's alot easier.
5/2/2010,"i didn't see the original post, so i can't speak to its content. but then, neither did most of the people reading this now, they can only work off what you haven't edited away and what's said here. i can see the original thread, and i can see your defence of the post. the thread started off with ""how many people have acctually considered suicide?"", and you posted something ""in jest"" as a reply that you removed because it would make you look bad. to my mind, that translates into you having made fun of the suicidal. i obviously don't know whether that's the case - and to be honest, you don't seem like the type to do that - but that's sure how you're making it seem. if that's not the case, you may want to rethink your damage control tactics. there are many things you could have said there that might have placated us. this? not one of them. and yet, that opposition hasn't stopped you from running again. no, a lot of them are there to buy implants and skills, or to buy light ships that they can run out to lowsec faster than the faction police can kill them. or they're flying to a different lowsec pocket."
5/2/2010,"hi there, what are your views on boosting piracy and high sec crime? i think these areas have been ignored for far to long and need to be improved."
5/2/2010,i'm merely stating that if -10's can move around hi sec so freely to go about there business then maybe having negative sec status ain't that 'harsh' of a punishment. cause someone was whining about it being all such a big deal
5/2/2010,"yeah, they can move around highsec freely, unless they want to use ships. but of course, it's not like this is a game about spaceships, after all."
5/2/2010,"yes, eve is completely about using ships, ofcourse, nothing to do in eve but fly ships..."
5/2/2010,definately got my vote. +1
5/2/2010,"i'm not a great fan of csm tbh, but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt.you have my votes."
5/2/2010,"bump, voting opens wednesday night!"
5/2/2010,"and here is our fundamental disagreement. i think you're absolutely wrong here, for the reasons stated above and in the tl;dr manifesto. as long as the game mechanics do not apply a penalty (either tactical, strategic, or managerial) for bringing extra ships to a big battle, lag will never go away. people will just bring more ships until lag returns.having each star system, or even each grid, on a single server will not help in the long run. if there are any non-linear factors at all in the code, then even small percentage increases in the number of players interacting in an engagement can cause the compute-load to explode. and even if the code is totally linear, if the number of players in the game increases faster than moore's law (which is slowing down), you're still screwed.we all want eve to be a success, and to increase the number of subscribers. what happens when eve has 2x or 3x the current number of subscribers?what you are basically saying, afaict, is ""the endgame of eve (large space-holding alliances running big fleet operations) is always going to be almost unplayable because of lag, so we have to provide other alternatives that involve small-gang combat that won't lag out.""fine. i would love to see more small-gang combat! it's my preferred type of pvp in the current environment. but with the current mechanics, how can you have any expectation that any small-gang alternatives are not going to be themselves blobbed into lag?how are you going to prevent 25 v 50 becoming 50 v 100, then 100 v 150, then 200 v 300, and so on?why, with some sort of game mechanic that makes larger fleet sizes non-optimal in some way!and if such a mechanic is devised, then why wouldn't the dev's apply it to the big blobs in the first place?as for arms-races, the devs are already in an arms-race with the players. they throw more compute, i/o, and better algorithms at the players, and the players add more ships to the engagements to capture the improvements.the way you stop an arms-race is by changing the rules of the game. often risky, and always unsettling. but there you go."
5/2/2010,what is your opinion on baiting/blobbing?
5/2/2010,"first, now, about barely used, arguably useless mods. if you totally remove them, you'll get that one guy who has some crazy setup that uses it. and while i'm really not worried about keeping absolutely everyone happy (because i know it'll never happen), it's an aspect of the game that is, to me, alluring. eve has some really interesting fitting options and think this should be preserved; there are tons of options when fitting a ship, and lots of them are bad - but when you understand some of the basics and come up with a fit that really kicks butt it's hugely rewarding. some of my first fits were terribad, but when i got that one that was fine tuned for excellence i was elated. that said, there are a glut of mods that could do with a bit of an inspection and rebalanced. some of them haven't changed since castor and that's silly. i'm cool with it. one of my favorite things to do in eve is bait, it gives me a rush and puts a smile on my face. as far as blobbing is concerned, the act of bringing more people than the other guy is an aspect of the game that will never be gone. that said, i don't want to promote changes that encourage or promote use of the blob."
5/2/2010,your opinion about blaster platforms/blaster in general?
5/2/2010,"thrasher+150mm guns+auto targeter+l1 mission frigates = awesome and a lot less targeting related rsiyou seem to have one vote extra, yay for people thinking things through."
5/2/2010,"you bring up an interesting question: is the problem with the blasters themselves, or the platforms? let's just go through the main blaster boats.taranis - owns, blasters work for this, making it arguably the best intythorax - garmon may have made the rupture the trendy t1 cruiser, but the thorax is still feared, respected, and awesome. deimos - has garnered the nickname of ""diemost"" and, generally, kind of a joke blaster platformvigilant - not very popular, but widely considered to be significantly better than a deimos. i think if they were cheaper, we'd see more of them.brutix - i think this ship excels as a blaster boat as well. they are fairly popular for bcsastarte - a corpmate of mine said ""hey i think i'll grab an astarte"" and everyone literally laughed and thought he was joking. the ship isn't a good blaster pvp platform, and forget about for pve. i'm not of the opinion that every ship needs to be balanced with every other ship, some ships should be better at certain roles, but this one...could do with some love. megathron - not too long ago, blasterthrons were the quintessential cool guy ship. you knew that if that dude got within 13km of you, you were about to enter a world of pain. a world of pain. now you're not really as paranoid, at least i'm not. if a mega doesn't have someone to pin a target down, it's not much of a threat. i know, battleships aren't solo pwn mobiles but the megathron needs something to tackle and it has to be close (but not too close). hyperion - great tank, but you can really notice the lack of a tracking bonus. vindicator - the quintessential cool guy ship. it's got the paint job, it's got the extra mid, it's got the ohgoditburns damage, and it's got that web that keeps you at the mercy of said damage.all in all, you've got the astarte and deimos who need a lot of help, with megas and hypes a little lacking. i think with an overall increase in tracking of blasters, and perhaps some added maneuverability to the platforms themselves, blaster boats could be cool again. regardless of how it is accomplished, i will admit that the lack of blasters in eve is a saddening trend that i am aware of.edit: windicator~"
5/2/2010,"hi cat,see this is how i also feel, i may have to rig up some kind of dartboard based decision engine sometime before voting day.either way, i support what you are doing, you go sister.evil incarn8."
5/2/2010,feel free to ask me questions on my campaign or about any issues you have with eve.
5/2/2010,very funny
5/2/2010,"how (in your opinion, and please elaborate) are destroyers sucking at the moment?"
5/2/2010,"i think main problem people have with destroyer hull is that it has no tank and the sig of a cruiser. personally sabre is one of my favorite ships and with the upcoming insurance changes which sound like increased insurance for dictors i will fly it even more. on the other hand i have gone on many roams in a thrasher and been near instapopped by a bc/bs which i think is kind of stupid because they aren't really so superior to frigates to justify that level of fragility. a second t2 destroyer with more interceptor-like bonuses (-% mwd sig modifier, tracking bonus, etc) with no ability to fit sphere launcher would be very nice imo."
5/2/2010,thanks :d
5/2/2010,up and thanks to keith.the interview
5/2/2010,"i could just dig into my photo archive and try to blackmail certain ccp developers (you know who you are!) with the possibility of releasing some of the embarrassing photos of them. i'm pretty sure blackmail is against the code of conduct for csm members though.ccp owns the game the csm can only really advise, but ccp are not stupid and i believe that the trick is to ensure that for every problem and proposal that the csm members have a clear idea of the effort required and the return on investment. in ccp's case there needs to be a clear gain in player satisfaction that induces more players to sign up and less players to quit.clearly ccp's schedule of releasing 2 major feature upgrades per year is based upon player acquisition and account reactivation. the csm is much more concerned with keeping existing players happy, and that's the primary leverage that the csm have. i would imagine that the people best qualified to get consistent action from ccp are those who understand both sides of the roi equation."
5/2/2010,"i, too, promise heaven and earth and lollypop unicorns will happen if i get elected.the truth is, we have no idea how ""being a stakeholder"" will pan out. for the first 4 csm's(that's two years!) ccp have been disorganized on their end about returning answers to questions posed by the csm(those are questions that ccp suggested we ask too), and although most of the csm proposals have been accepted by ccp, those are mostly very small tweaks, and the csm has had very little influence on the really big parts of the game. i think the skill queue is the biggest thing the csm has ever been a part of, and that really isn't so big if you think in terms of how much effort it took ccp to implement.the vast majority of the things the csm can take credit for is stuff like- ""this or that button added in this dialog box"".so we'll see how it pans out. i know that if i get some real power over ccp i would make them devote more programmer time towards fixing old features that frustrate existing subscribers the most. some dev's pet project might be nice but the real core of the game that everybody knows well haven't been touched much at all, and really need some work. shiny new features might attract more subs for a short time, but crusty old features such as how ****ty poses and the corp interface are drives longterm players away.a prime example of that is the newbie tutorials. ever since they overhauled the whole thing it has been a lot better for newcomers to the game, and more people stayed with the game after trying it."
5/2/2010,"exactly. the problem is, that ccps model of releasing major expansions does draw in/back players for a short time, but in the long term it is unsustainable as players get weary of broken promises and issues that seep into the game.ccps model may work now, but with 3 highly anticipated space mmos entering the field at the end of 2010, i think the game will really be in trouble if ccp doesn't adapt their strategy. after all, it is easy to get a player back to the game if he's not playing anything else or not happy with the thing he's playing. but once someone leaves for a different game and is satisfied there, the odds are drastically reduced."
5/2/2010,"first, i am amazed that a troll thread actually has morphed it to a real discussion about the csm and it's power/impact with ccp.second, bah... now i am late to the party.the quote above as well as the need for a csm member to be able to see whether a concept is workable from a coding standpoint is very important. a personal pet peeve of mine is the eve font. (booo, hisss!!!) switching to a more readable font is not a major undertaking. adding a system that allows the player to choose or even add a font to the game is far more complex. at the same time ether choice is good from a finical perspective. an easier to read font would help with customer retention do to the removal of an annoying aspect of the game. (or at least that is what i would say to the beancouters. )a candidates agenda is really more about seeing where their perspective is rather then seeing what they will do for the game. this is still an election and votes today matter, results are for later and are moot.as a last bit the csm is better for small items rather then large ones. i would like to see my ""right-click to insure ship"" idea in game. (i have started doing that every item i insure a ship since i proposed it. then i have to figure out why i can't do it and then go to the station insure button.) it is a ""simple"" change. the code for ""right-click to repair"" should be able to be used.the font issue is just ccp being bull-headed. i think that will only happen if you have the csm screaming like kids in the supermarket, ""i want candy!!!"". they will only brake when they are tired of hearing the screaming.my larger concept of expanding npc 0.0 is a great idea and will befit the game but, i do understand that it is unlikely to be implemented. if ccp does do something with it it would not be fore several years. by then eve will ether have a shrinking player base and it won't be needed or the player base will have expanded to the point where it has to happen.summing up, anyone can move a mountain. it is not about picking up the entire mountain and moving it. you find a rock you can carry. move that and go back to get another rock. in the end they mountain will be moved.(i should be more awake when posting this kinda of stuff. i hope i made sense.)"
5/2/2010,"it was intended as a serious thread but i was orphaned as a child and raised by trolls so have a tendency to drool and rant when posting, apologies for the confusion.many thanks for the informative replies, especially mazzilliu and teadaze. when i started the thread i wasn't aware the proposal to make the csm in to stakeholders had been put in to practice so my main concern has already been dealt with and trebor summed it up nicely: best of luck to all candidates in improving the process. some of you may be aware of the k<U+FFFD>bler-ross model, i've used it before to troll the whiners who spring up around patch time but the more i think about it the more relevant it seems to be:1denial - i've just made it out to 0.0 and been given a shiny new battleship, this game's amazing, nothing could be wrong with it.2anger - the grid wouldn't load and i'm going to emo rage on the forums about loosing my shiny battleship. fix the lag you useless bunch of ccp drunkards.3bargaining - i've got an idea to fix eve so i'll make an assembly hall thread.4depression - i'm sick of hauling pos fuel / lag / lvl 4's / rockets / my assembly hall thread being ignored / whatever.5acceptance - being a permanent beta tester isn't so bad, i'll just ignore the bugs and go troll the forums.a lot of players seem to go through a version of this process, some will make it to stage five but many will quit before then and i believe there's two big financial incentives for ccp to indulge the csm a little more than they have in the past: players are less likely to quit if the bargaining in stage three is successful. one day someone's going to launch a worthwhile game that competes with eve. if ccp wait till that day before sorting the issues that really **** players off they'll lose a lot of players. development times are just too long to try and fix player concerns after the competition arrives.i'm genuinely shocked by this, ccp are clearly not getting value out of the csm in terms of player retention if this is how little players care about you, a bit of time promoting csm successes could go a long way.i assume the ""lollypop unicorns"" will be one of the dodgyier bars that are likely to appear after incarna?"
5/2/2010,"a good vote is a terrible thing to waste whether you vote for me or someone else, every ""pro pvp"" vote will help ensure that candidates who understand and support eve's true nature get elected. so good on ya, regardless of your choice of pro-pvp candidates."
5/2/2010,"ehhh that could be a bad thing really. hypothetically speaking, if ahnkhdjfhsjdhflj got, say, 30 votes towards her, and you and mazz got 25 each, ahnkkdjfhskjljf would still win (30 vs 25) even though the majority was against ahnk's ideas (50 vs 30). with so many 'pro-pvp' candidates compared to the smaller (from what i've seen, anecdotal evidence) 'anti-pvp' ones, it may end up going that way. however, anecdotal evidence is anecdotal, and hypothetical situations are hypothetical >_>"
5/2/2010,"on the other hand, ank can occupy only 1 seat of 9 if she gets elected. so chances are good that no matter which pro pvp candidates get in, they will form a majority that can oppose her anti-pvp ideas."
5/2/2010,"being able to work well with others is a skill that is very important in this kind of council. if a delegate is combative, rude, inflexible or otherwise hard to deal with then you can bet their ideas won't fly.at the end of the day any proposals to be added to an iceland summit and thus discussed with ccp need to be passed by a majority vote of the csm. proposals not passed by the csm cannot be discussed no matter how driven the candidate proposing them."
5/2/2010,"so... you're saying that eve is basically a defective, simplistic shin-kicking version of missile command at its most basic level and everyone's too lazy to fix it or come up with something remotely believable?i mean, there's merit to adjusting tracking for numerous other reasons as well, for instance wouldn't it be nice if the visual engine actually rendered a wrecking hit vs. a miss? sooner or later these problems will have to be addressed because game mechanics (and a whole way of combat) are already broken because of the current approach."
5/2/2010,"won't somebody please think of the children!if ankh got her way then my 5 year old girl would have been banned from the game for suicide ganking a zephyr, or she would have been sent to eve prison.a vote for ankh is a vote against the next generation of eve players!"
5/2/2010,"i'm saying it's a game. gameplay comes before realism. we have a system that works and creates good gameplay. it's not what i'd start with if you handed me a blank sheet of paper, but it's fine, and i'm not going to overthrow the whole thing just because i find a different system to be more aesthetically pleasing."
5/2/2010,"it's a game about spaceships, where the ships can fly multiple times the speed of light, it's never going to be believable. it can however at least be playable."
5/2/2010,"aha, now i see why people whine about blaster tracking. the orbit button in a short range ship is not something you should automatically click every single damn time.it's there when you have a particular need to orbit a target to lower their dps, like, eg. you're fighting a larger ship or one with superior dps/ehp balance but significantly inferior tracking and stuff (amarr boat with ****** fit).for all other purposes, keep at range is your best friend. after all, you're flying a gankboat. why on earth would you want to lower your dps once someone is already in pounding range?blaster problems are more related to fitting woes (below bs level), not enough dps to justify them over much longer ranged guns with selectable damage types and 0 cap use, and stuff like that."
5/2/2010,"you're a little confused on this - but i know a lot of the candidates aren't exactly falling over themselves to run rookie missions, so it's entirely forgivable. (i was the only player doing any testing of the new rookie missions prior to dominion's release, while everyone else was whining about flying titans and getting level 5 skills).there's 2 missions in the advanced combat that require you to lose a ship, and you're given ships to do this, the whole advanced combat arc is a great thing in general and i'd like to see some of the mission requirements extended to higher level missions - specificly having to hold down targets with warp distruptors rather than just having them hang around while you kill them.there's also the 'experimental' gallente storyline missions which send pilots into the caldari/gallente fw combat zones to kill a bunch of npc haulers protected by caldari ships. these have generated a whole lot of whining, and i was surprised that when they were brought up at the last csm meeting only elvenlord had first hand experience. while most of the complaints were grounded in basic fear of low-sec, there were legitimate complaints. the agents always sent you to the same section of space regardless of where the agent was, it wasn't atypical to find you had to fly 30 jumps to get there. they were only for gallente pilots, there would be a whole lot less stress if every faction got these kind of missions. the missions themselves were actually amazingly easy if you used two pilots in combat frigates, one to 'create a diversion' and another to kill the haulers. it made me wish that there were some missions in the game designed specificly to require multiple pilots (proving more than just extra tank and gank).there's also a bunch of story arc missions that require pilots to go into low/null-sec - the arc mission sets are without question a good thing, but while the back story is more detailed and involved the actual mission mechanics are still stuck in the same gameplay ghetto that eve missions are suffering from."
5/2/2010,"why don't you tell me :), thats the beauty of this, you tell me what you want and ill get it done!"
5/2/2010,"so if i say that caldari needs to be buffed, and someone else says that caldari needs to be nerfed, what exactly is it that you're going to get done?"

5/3/2010,"your persistence in posting misinformation, deflection and general rubbish that has no bearing on the op?rrrrright because fleets never warp in blobs. strike one.strike two. that's so completely idiotic, illogical and nonsensical you can't even really expect anyone to post a rational reponse to it. i'm claiming that dps does matter - much more so than ehp - because the more incoming dps you can focus onto a single target will almost automatically kill it before it even has an opportunity to respond.400 bs shooting at one target? and you're claiming ehp matters? maybe if you're talking ehp's in excess of 500k, which would be a dreadnought, or a carrier but for a bs sized target? quite often bubbled? please. it's a joke to claim that 800 or so extra ehp is going to make a blind bit of difference with even a small number of hostile battleships focusing fire - this is also the reason why active local tanking in general is ineffective in anything other than solo/small gang/pve situations.yes, that extra half second before you pop really helps.ok that's a very wordy way of saying you want to maximize performance of your fits and nothing else. you're not really advocating anything more than common sense. of course i want to fit as much tank as i can, however since it is no longer ye olde days of yore where the benchmark was fitting enough ehp to tank a titan ddd. in a fleet fight with 800 total bs, 400 on each side who are both calling one primary at a time, who do you think will win? even if the non-tanking side only out-dpses by 50 or so units each, the multiplication effect will wind up being equal to bringing an extra 18 bs or so along. it's ridiculous to claim ehp matters a damn when you compare it against incoming dps from 400-odd hostile ships. and finally, what does any of this garbage you keep posting about fleet fights actually have to do with blasters?"
5/3/2010,"that is a person?that has no bearing on whether or not one side or another is at its ideal range. strike three. at any time that you have enough dps to kill a target before it has a chance to respond your dps has as little bearing on the target as its ehp. if you have 400 bs as you say then each bs could be doing 100 dps with a 4 second refire rate and you would still kill the target in 1 second400 ships with 400 volley each volleys(100 dps @ 4 second re-fire) through 160k ehp per volley. so, in your claim, any dps over 100 does not matter because your mass of ships is going to waste the other side anyway, 160k ehp is way more than any fleet battleship is going to have. so more dps is totally a waste!except no one believes that, its foolish. so why do you believe that having more ehp doesn't matter when having more dps does? that claim is so fundamentally insane that its almost pointless to discuss. targets die when the amount of damage they take reaches their ehp. if a targets ehp doesn't matter then no amount of dps does either because something is happening here that breaks the fundamental rules of the game that say ""damage is subtracted from hit points; when a ship hits 0 hit points it explodes""your claim literally rests on a presumption that big numbers are big and holy molely look at those big numbers! its bull.actually the simulation that laing ran in the other thread pretty clearly demonstrates that ehp * dps is the clear winner. in a fleet fight with 400 bs on each side extra ehp matters just as much as extra dps. and it has as much to do with blasters as hybrids have anything to do with blasters. the guy whining that hybrids were terrible brought it up and so i am refuting it."
5/3/2010,"the goal of a fleet fight is to get the enemy fleets hit points to zero before your fleets hit points reach zero. your fleet can increase its chances by bringing either more hit points or more damage. an extra 800 ehp amy not help you, personally, if you are called primary, but it will help your fleet."
5/3/2010,realy?:o my experience completly disagree with this.
5/3/2010,funny how fast a blaster thread turns into a rails + fleet thread. not that we already have such a thing right here in ah.
5/3/2010,i still can't believe ccp hasn't done something about this. it's been an ongoing theme for about 4 years now. the solution is simple. keep blasters as short range and difficult to use as they always have been but make them worth fitting none the less. high dps and fast tracking. job done.
5/3/2010,"not really, when the incoming dps is so extreme that it will waste any local tank that isn't a capital ship in seige/triage mode or a titan. no, ehp doesn't matter as much as dps because the incoming dps will fry the target before it has a reasonable chance to respond - granted mostly due to limitations of lag, but there we have it - that's the practical application. and once again with a fantastic duh i'm not advocating pure glass cannon fits, of course you want as much ehp as you can get out of your ship, but that's really secondary to fitting for as much dmg as possible to get on top of killmails whilst hoping and praying the opposing fc doesn't call you primary.but hybrids are terrible, almost as terrible as you are at actually addressing salient points and keeping on topic :)absolutely - mostly because some people would rather post something completely unrelated in the hope that people will stop paying attention to the thread rather than actually sticking to the op. in that regard, sorry for biting - but the stupid, it burned."
5/3/2010,"ask the op why he wants to discuss 50km engagement ranges linkif that is the case. if you have so many ships that you waste anything, then the dps of any ship doesn't matter either. that is the key that you're not seeing. if ehp doesn't matter then neither does dps. if dps doesn't matter the only thing that matters is whether or not you are in range to hit your enemy.ahhh, that is what its really about isn't it? its not about bringing the best ship to win the fight, its about your electronic phallus.edit: you see, getting on top of killmails does not win fights. its gets you on top of killmails. we aren't here to determine which ship you fly when you can't afford a convertible. we are here to determine whether or not they're good ships.and the problems with the ships are not due to weapon types. for more information, see the link in my sig"
5/3/2010,boost blasters^^
5/3/2010,"dps matters regardless of ehp, because the additive power of many players shooting at a single ship is greater than the capacity of any single local tank, and that's the key that you are not seeing.funny, because i was under the impression that being higher on the killmail means you contributed more, proportionately, to destroying that target, thus delivering more firepower more effectively and killing the enemy quicker, so they are unable to shoot back with their already-having-been-destroyed ships, thus rendering your ehp argument moot.and no, we're not here to determine whether or not they're good ships. i'm here because i've already determined hybrids are poorly balanced - apparently i'm not alone in that conclusion - and i'm asking for a good discussion on how to fix them. which you aren't providing.why on earth would i want to subject myself to that?"
5/3/2010,"no. i am seeing what happens when you add up dps. but if you increase ehp by 1% it has the same effect as decreasing the dps of every ship of your opponents fleet by 1%.if you have 20% more ehp then it takes 20% more dps to kill you in the same time frame. which is the same as your opponent having 20% less dps.such guardians and falcons are worthless mirite?besides the inherent inefficiencies involved using that as a metric (damage types come to mind) you're discounting the effect of people shooting you on your fleets damage. imagine for a second that you are shot first in a fleet compared to if you're shot last. if you're shot first the amount of damage that you do is equal to the time it takes the enemy to kill you multiplied by your dps.if you're shot last the amount of damage that you do is equal to the time it takes to kill every ship in front of you multiplied by your dps. this means that when you increase your ehp if you're called early you increase the total damage that everyone in your fleet does.this portion of your contribution does not show up at the top of killmails. it does not make you look like a hero. but it does win fleet fights, and that is what makes fleet ships good. and that must be accounted for when examining whether or not ships are goodso you came to a conclusion using uncritical methods and you're surprised that someone is going to challenge that? because you care about understanding eve enough to have these discussionsnote: targeting delays are a symmetrical issue that apply to both dps and ehp equally. i.e. if you're destroying ships fast enough that the limiter for destroying ships becomes your lock time, then that same reduction in effectiveness that is applied to a targets ehp is applied to your dps."
5/3/2010,throwing this into the pot.we're looking for ways to encourage players to venture into lo-sec in the first place. my main is pirate (this is hi-sec mission running alt) and will avoid lo-sec if at all possible. simply because i know how dangerous it is. the main problem with lo-sec at the moment is that the pirates are bored and will attack anything that looks interesting. this is mostly each other because there is no-one else.tyrannis will up the incentives for going into lo-sec with more valuable/less crowded planets but this isn't enough. i think that something like a fw mechanic but between pirates and concord would be the way to go.just my 2c
5/3/2010,some great ideas

5/3/2010,"i was just offered yet another one of these missions. this time it's 31 jumps away, 6 jumps deep into low sec space. reward is a sub 10 million isk implant and some pocket change. makes no sense to accept it, really. i'm all for more variance in missions but the reward should reflect the risk and the player should have a choice. whoever thought these were a good idea in their current form clearly don't have a clue. maybe ccp should open source eve online and have the players take care of the development? at least we're somewhat familiar with the game oh, and don't you just love being gallente?"
5/3/2010,"interesting reading trader jen and thank you for your post. sony bmg was well within they're rights to produce software on cds they created for their clients being that they had to protect their clients copy rights against music pirates which is why there is that nice fbi warning at the beginning of every dvd you purchase. as well as on the back of a cd case. this has to deal with copy right laws, and incorrect documentation of software being issued to the end user. if you really wish to go down this legal route with me that is perfectly fine. being that this same issue has been brought up in multiple markets about a company having incorrect documentation on a product for end users. a good example of this is the food labeling regulations on food products, or ethanol and methyl tert-butyl ether which a lot of fuel companies used to use because mtbe was cheaper then ethanol which now mtbe is outlawed for several reasons. we could even bring up the nuclear industry or a retail outlet called ""wal-mart"" lol there is plenty of legal examples and if you want to continue down the route of computer software we can do that as well i'm sure i can find another software title by a big company that had incorrect documentation on its protection software. it wasn't the companies intentions to ""scan"" a personal computer for private information. it was their intention to prevent the end-user music pirates from stealing. it just so happened that their coding was flawed in a way that it brought legal repercussions. being that it installed itself silently with out the end-users knowledge, and did not offer the ability to remove itself which in that case is considered spy-ware or a virus of which it did make the system sluggish and allowed access to third-party users of which could have stolen personal data. but again i bring up my same argument as before, we have software already on our systems that scan your personal data everyday if not every 5 minutes if you truly wish to be safe from such privacy invasion don't connect the computer you have all your personal data on to the internet and/or don't have a computer at all."
5/3/2010,"adding an extra process that runs continuously (or for a long time) is contrary to the idea of ""need for speed"" and would seriously mess with fleet fights. currently, many people log out then log back in right before a fight to clear their cache, dial down graphics, shut down other processes on their computer, turn off brackets, restart their routers, and various other things in hopes of better performance in a fight. if something like this was on eve clients, everyone and their sister would want some way to circumvent the scanner to prevent it from using up system resources. something like this would hurt more than it helped."
5/3/2010,"i like it but the ""tinfoil hat""/""macro mining""/""i am not a macro miner but hate the idea but secretly macro mine"" crowd will refuse to let it pass."
5/3/2010,"lol typical darius trying to make out a big problem small. you think 2 hulks and an orca mining 23/7 isn't going to make a big impact? it's not about the solo miners, its about the macro fleets. these fleets regularly sell inhuman amounts of minerals to their suppliers, people have attested to it, i even know a corpmate who does it. i'm not surprised, 2 hulks going at it 23/7? that's a lot of ore. even the solo hulks can rack up a lot.the numbers don't need to be flaunted by ccp, just ask the manufacturers. you can get the sources from there, numbers don't lie, a ship that mines 23 hours in one day is not being manned by a pilot that is for sure.that said. it really is sort of pathetic how knee jerking the response it by eve players. ""no way! totally do not impliment i will totally quit eve"" ""its spyware"" i'm sorry, i thought spyware went around trying to find passwords, sensitive documents, and credit cards. not check your computer for bots. people wouldn't even notice it if ccp implimented it. the paranoia is hysterical. i would totally support this if ccp could get the macros off the game."
5/3/2010,"supported. erase the remnants of one of the worst game feature decisions ccp has ever made.on a side note: i can not by any stretch of my imagination comprehend, why people argue, that bpos are overpriced, therefore have a bad return for the investment, hence are generally worthless and take this as proof for invention being superior. people the whole point is, that these bpos are simply owned by players that won them and dont require any investment. their enormous price tags further show, that even if you would buy them the return seems to be not shabby either."
5/3/2010,at least change all of them to -4 me or less.
5/3/2010,"you're an idiot, as with everyone else supporting this thread. t2 bpos aren't hurting you, its everyone else who invents that hurts you. the more people inventing, the lower the price of the product. everyone can invent while a select few have bpos. its the people who invent that decide the market price, not the bpo holders.fyi, i don't have a t2 bpo. i invent and undercut people like you on the market every 5 minutes, and make you cry tears when you can't understand why you're failing so hard, so that you all can come to the forums and whine about how the game isn't easy enough for you. :)"
5/3/2010,yes.
5/3/2010,"agreed, hence they got rid of them. i want my chance to win the lottery, or the removal of the bpos."
5/3/2010,"i don't own any t2 bpos and i think it's a horrendous idea, deleting something which does not present a imbalance of any sort and was very expensive to obtain just because of jealousy.besides, what's the point with discussing things with someone stupid enough to believe t2 bpo owners ""break the t2 market"" somehow?"

5/3/2010,"fyp.not supported, but you dont want support anyway since its a troll post i take it."
5/3/2010,"don't be a smartass. just because you believe something to be self-evident it doesn't mean the rest of us think so. you have presented your opinion and your experience... but you have yet to logically follow us through the reasons why it is ""gamebreaking"" and deserving of a change that the rest of us seem to believe it doesn't need.if you truly do believe that it is ""gamebreaking"" and that you don't need to add more input than you already have, then let me run you through my logic of the situation. you say:here is how you can counter this:~ if you are in a frig, don't turn on your mwd. the sig radius ""bloom"" than happens makes you receive more damage and can potentially pop you.~ there is a 3 to 6 second window where a stealth bomber uncloaks and launches a bomb before warping... make sure your ""fast tackle"" takes advantage of this instead of freaking out about the incoming bomb.~ have logistics... bombs can only be launched every minute or so, more than enough time to rep everyone in a small-ish gang to a safe level (if it's a large gang then repairs should be almost immediate)~ if a mob of stealth bombers have basically flattened your group in one go, kudos to the stealth bomber gang. to do such a feat is no small thing and takes time, dedication, and preparation to perform. next time bring more buffer and follow the above steps."
5/3/2010,"apologies, let me list my reasons:stop saying i did not list any reasons why when i did, but i am sure you will continue to try and derail my thread and twist my words anyways further displaying how moronic you are."
5/3/2010,again... this is purely your opinion... an opinion which is easily countered as per the points i made in my previous posts.if you truly do think that flying a stealth bomber is not risky then strap yourself in one and play around with it. they are far from invincible.
5/3/2010,"there are enough counters to bombers for those who think about it instead of whining for nerfs, more then there ever was for aoe doomsday"

5/3/2010,"maybe you should try asking yourself what you could do differently so that this doesn't continue to happen? i mean, even a relatively unintelligent animal can learn if presented with unsatisfactory outcomes in a repetitive fashion."
5/3/2010,"if they made it available to see bookmarks on your grid (a new minimap would be great) a alternate solution that you have to warp from point a which is your launch point to point b which have to be on grid would make things more intresting imo, just being alinged to something celestial between urself and ur target is abit too easy imo, thats my 5isk of input"
5/3/2010,you cant post a bomber buff in a thread about nerfing them!
5/3/2010,"bombers are fine as they are, i see quite a few die every day. currently bombers are an effective tactic against big blobs and the bombers themselves are easily countered by smart movement, smaller blobs, interdictors and sub-bs ships. this is pretty much the definition of ""balanced""."
5/3/2010,"i woulnt call it a buff, more of a modification current mechanics, altho i maybe should put the minimap thing in a new thread but im lazy today"
5/3/2010,a dozen guys in frigates should not be able to wipe out a 100 battleship fleet with ease in just a few seconds. this is the very definition of a ship being over powered. period!
5/3/2010,"let me guess, you had been in that badger, when the initiative wiped your fleet with bombers?waiting for titan bridge outside the shield again?"
5/3/2010,fyp.
5/3/2010,"please add a ""do not support this topic"" box under ""support this topic"" then please.also, not supported. if i could link killmails, i would show how often stealth bombers die. they aren't an i-win button. emo tj posts are going downhill.if your fleet sat there and let enough bombers drop on your glass canon battleship fleet without doing anything, you deserve to have learned this lesson."
5/3/2010,"correct. they set there for quite a while, clustered right on the bridge at 0kmoh and it wasn't ""a dozen guys in frigate"" we had 4 full squads making a total of 9 runs. does tj want to nerf bombs enough that a bs can tank ~60-70 bomb hits...?"
5/3/2010,not supported.
5/3/2010,"lol, jesus christ man, stop being dumb.maybe you should tell your uber ******ed fleet commanders to stop being so dumb to begin with maybe?. sitting at a jump bridge with around 150-200 bs'es ready to jump with jump fuel enough to only jump out 50 bs'es is a very good idea.hahah, this is what i call for epicly owned in yo face."
5/3/2010,"so because this game has yet another sore eye (jump bridge requiring fuel ) over a hundred of my friends are punished by losing their ships they worked hard for. this is no better than going into low sec just to get ganked by a 50 man camp. how is that supposed to be fun?anyways, back on topic. my point has been made and justified. please give a thumbs up so this ship can be balanced."
5/3/2010,lol op nc alt spoted grow some balls sh!t happens lolbtw nice whine can we have cheese with this whine btw did u loose 150 man fleet to a bombing raid today lolmy english sux sue me or bomb me :)gogo initive u rock guys :)
5/3/2010,"it's just your own dumb fault that you get spanked by bombers. stealth bombers are perfectly fine as they are.oh noes, they was ****d hardcore for they own stupidity. well, you know what?, that was extremely deserved tbh.i have a hint for you. the first thing is: learn pvp, the 2nd thing is: learn to use your brain.i have been bombed quite some times in my sniper tempest, but because we know what we are doing, i have lost none to any bombers. last time i was bombed by stealth bombers, i think i was hit by 5-6 bombs and got out with 15% armor in my shield tanked tempest. so start being way smarter and you can start to be more successfull in eve.eve online is not hello kitty online.edit: just to say the same as the atlas guy over me said. the initiative is doing a great job with their bombers. so keep up the good work the initiative."
5/3/2010,"not supportedtastey tastey nc alt tears! yummy150 bs can die to a well organised, well fc'd 25man bomber gang, true. but 500 bombers could die to a random solo bomber too.if you really think there is no risk, try actually flying a bomber. sebo zealot/inty/bubble/2seconds lag = dead bombers...been there, seen it, done it!not only were they sat on a pos, but when you jump into 25 hostiles and nothing is on scan, alarm bells should be ringing...theres a reason for that shield around the pos (its safe in there) purely fc's fault for a bad call!op is a fool! fact!"
5/3/2010,"perhaps after you satisfactorily explain malcanis' post a couple up from the quoted one. if they had time to make 9 bombing runs on your fleet then you, frankly, deserved to die, especially given the cycle time of a bomb launcher."
5/3/2010,stop trolling my assembly hall thread. caod is that way __>
5/3/2010,"9 runs total, made by 4 squads about 12 seconds apart. only squad 1 got a 3rd launch (i did nothing of value on the 3rd run because i forgot the launchers need to reload :p)but they'd been sat on the bridge, outside the shields, for about 5 minutes by the time we turned up... kind of a welp moment for them. happens to us all tbh."
5/3/2010,"so lets see: you sit a few km from the saving pos shield, instead of waiting inside the shield (smart way) you sit right on the jb while waiting for the fuel. correct?you sir got punished for your own stupidity. smart people wait *inside* the shield."
5/3/2010,"with all due respect, bull****. i didn't call him a troll because i dislike his idea. i called him a troll because he has a continuing history of posting ideas so incredibly ludicrous that literally nobody believes he's serious. i took him seriously for the first few, but he has proven himself not to be worth that consideration. he is banned from the csm public chat channel - the only person to earn that honour - and the only comment that ban got was ""why did it take you so long""? a simple perusal of his comment history should be sufficient to convince anyone of his lack of honesty with regards to the issues he pushes. he is a troll, full stop. do not make a mockery of the moderation process by defending him."
5/3/2010,"at the moment when a pos is low on resources you get a warning mail every hour about it, which ceo, directors and i believe members with the correct pos management roles recieve.it just comes down to spam, and is unneed in this extent in my opinion.ways to fix it which are not mutually exclusive;a) limit status mails to 24hours and 1 hour before resources are depletedb) make these mails optional, add a setting to not recieve those mails c) remove mails all togeither, but add a pos management window, which lets you look at the status of all your poss and their resource status (would be pretty useful anyway)please support, i know i am not the only one annoyed by the pos spam"
5/3/2010,d) keep towers fueled correctly so it doesnt cry?e) use the pos api to monitor your tower.

5/3/2010,"hey. it would be great if one could choose to be alerted via e-mail the day before your account subscription is over. my bank doesn't allow me to transfer funds into paypal after 21:00 (which is before my playtime), making the account unusable every now and then.thank you. :)"
5/3/2010,didnt they add the remaining subscription time to the character selection screen?

5/3/2010,"delayed local has a couple problems. . .ok actually its got a lot of problems.however i do like the idea so long as we decide to take it a step further. here's just a ""spattering"" of ideas:increase belt sizes to over 750km. rat spawn locations and ore regeneration talored to fit of course. provide beacons for the 0km point of the belt, then leave others to explore +750km in each direction.^^^implement a reduction of visual on-grid distancing. maybe back to 250km. this allows the hunted to ""hide"" in the belts and do their work, whether it be ratting or mining. i think that if you incorporate this sort of stuff in, plus keep in the deepsafes (why the **** are you getting rid of that btw jesus), and you might be getting closer to local removal, especially in 0.0 space.however, 0.0 soveriegn space should get insta-local, because after all, its their space."
5/3/2010,no it didnt. w space has many unique differences that make it a totally different kettle of fish. not least of which are spawning in jump range and the restirctions on numbers. you are misinformed if you think they are comparable.
5/3/2010,"w-space proved that no local works in w-space. that's it. the mechanics between k-space and w-space are different and the ""success"" (or lack thereof) in k-space can and will vary."
5/3/2010,supported. the game would need a better d-scanner though.
5/3/2010,"this would make pvp roams (in their current form) take way too long. i can't imagine waiting at gates for scouts to search every system for something to kill. waiting for scouts to identify if players have safed up or are docked in the systems with someone in local is bad enough when you've been on a roam for a while.no local isn't the giant boost to pvp you are trying to make it out to be. roams don't use voodoo to find which systems people are in, they use local."
5/3/2010,this it would just kill roaming not that is that great now. what should be done is to increase income from belts/anoms + make harder to warp to safe.
5/3/2010,"i think we should seriously discuss proposal of adding/changing several 0.0 regions with no local, with minor to no scanner improvements. then when scanner is redesigned significantly and the performance of new 0.0 is evaluated, further discussion should take place on converting all of 0.0 to no local.this would be a more reasonable request than the current ""all or nothing"" approachmaybe call the new no local regions as -1, and since they should be richer than other 0.0, have all systems there be -1 true sec"
5/3/2010,"while i'm not opposed to the greater concept of ""no local"" in 0.0 or low sec, i agree with deja on this. :thumbsdown:"
5/3/2010,"ok lets separate the pussies from hardcore people with new regions.nobody will force you into big scary no-local space, just don't let your fear get in the way of other people's fun"
5/3/2010,"hi,my name is tibalt avalon (ingame). i would like to make proposal. william demeo: your an idiot."
5/3/2010,"rofloh man.. 2/10 because of your sad attempt at formal english.pirates should be punished because you had to use the toilet... ahhh that's one i've not heard before.but no really, not supported. gb2wow noob"
5/3/2010,"hello kitty that way >>>>>>>oh, by the way, you suck."
5/3/2010,"i would pay more for my subscription if when i kill your character, the character is dead. no clone. dead."
5/3/2010,"lololoolololololololoooooll wtf go back to wow if you cant take the hard part of eve. imo everyone should have a mod which cost 1 isk, could be bought on all stations and was passive. when you fit it your invulnerable m'kay?!!and what if the pirates pay plex's? then an extra fee of 50mill isk will be added on like cspa xd?"
5/3/2010,i can't believe there are so many actually biting :p
5/3/2010,"suicide ganking has become ridiculous. everybody and their mother are running around exploding stuff and suffering next to no consequences. it is not about high value cargo anymore. it has come to the point, where people suicide their bs for fun.as so many are not tiring to say, concord can not save you but should provide consequences indeed. while i too find the basic concept of suicide ganking valid, i support:- no insurance payout for concord kills (i mean none at all and no this will not lead to noob players leaving the game).- in addition to the insurance not covering your suicide ship, they become more reluctant to pay other losses because you become a high risk costumer. basically: you wanne be a pirate, deal with the consequences. there is still a ****load of money to be made, but you live the life of an outlaw then."
5/3/2010,"there are ways to avoid suicide ganking, as above people have posted.personally i think suicide gankink should be a valid tactic, however, tehere should always be punishment and loss for doingit, what i have always suggested is simple:if concord destroy or are invlved in destroying your ship, your insurance should be invalidated, simple. if comncord are on your lossmail your insurance payout is 0. zero. nothing, as you are obviously doing something illegal to warrant it.before flaming me, i actually do suicide ganking myself, and as much as i think the above should be brought in, teh option and risk should always be there."
5/3/2010,"and normally when pirates kill someone, they would stay dead. we have clones and insurance companies that aren't remotely concerned about profit in eve. realism would make life even worse for people getting ganked, not better."
5/3/2010,"by ""high risk customer"", that includes ship losses anywhere, right? 'cause low sec and 0.0 losses would void insurance as well, not to mention wars and ****ing ppl off to give them a reason to blow your ship up.and low sec piracy isn't technically ""illegal""? r u suggesting we should void insurance on low sec pirates too? 'cause judging from your killboard, u'd be hurting yourself and your blob wouldn't take too kindly to your suggestion either. and speaking of your killboard, u do not suicide gank so u don't even know wtf u're talking about. love it when ppl impersonate without having to prove it."
5/3/2010,"concord are not there to protect you, they are there to punish the outlaws"
5/3/2010,"time is money, and ships will no longer be free for anyone come tyrannis.capitals are going to have insurance essentially speaking removed completely, too, which is a nice change."
5/3/2010,fixed.
5/3/2010,"realy so where is the punish part in loosing no more than 5m isk for a suicide raven?:oeverybody who think current high sec pirateing is fine are morons.you say ppl are stupid to haul expensive stuffs unprotected.1st protection would need some alt/friends and hauling as fun as now ,i cant see my friends eager to fly by my transport ship to do the repetative lock/rr warp out jump sequences,so it remains to alt--> so much for the reason it encourage multiplaying it doesnt.2nd stuff doesnt even have to be expensive because it is nearly 0 isk loss for the pirates to kill your transport.the loss of the victim hugely outweights the ""loss"" of the attacker(""pirate"") even if cargo doesnt taken into account. fe: 1 freighter ~700m isk around 20bs to kill it max 100m isk ,so even with very cheap cargo the pirates come out positively that is so wrong. pirating should be all about finding the tasty targets and kill those,not everythink they whish to just because they can do it due to no real loss. it can realy be used as griefing which isnt good for anygame.3rd freigher/jf/orca costs so much money/sp that the newer players cant afford them, and smaller transports arent that great, and even at 100m isk cargo which is not much at all ,""pirates"" will fire at you.4th there is no future loss of anykind other than pirate's current ship and a very small sec stat loss.5th you dont have to use auto-pilot to be got ganked, better pirates can scan your transport just fine before you can warp off. oh and cloaky blockade runner doesnt realy have enough cargo for most hauling.cancelling insurance payouts if concord is involved would change this to acceptable lvl--> pirates would only attack those who carry realy expensive stuffs.i would even make concord to pod the pirates, maybe even force them to pay isk to be able to reenter high sec without consequences before a give time like 2-3 days pass.also for low-sec pirates,there is realy no drawback after -5 sec status to future loosing sec status, at least concord should ocasionally send fleets to kill these pirates and pod them :pmaybe there could be a skill which increase the chance to items not getting destroyed when ship blown up for pirate wannabes.oh and about that a newbie would be penalized because they are mistakely shoot somebody in empire and get a huge loss is stupid. first noobs wont fly expensive ships because they are just started the game2nd there is a popup window which tells you if you realy want to shoot and concord will kill you if you do--> the noob must be braindead if he still continue3rd we already come to the conclusion that the newbie is braindead to agrees in highsec,so can you realy see he would insurance his ship before this? because i cant , only if he accidentally clicks on insurance ^^in short do you realy think that 5m isk loss /battleships for pirates is a real consequence for agressing in high-sec?but i know you are the elit because you can gank hopeless haulers,becuse you are that awesome players.btw i've never lost my transporter , and i ocasionally gank freighters in high sec, but it is still out of control."
5/3/2010,"and where's the punishment for losing no more than 5 mil in a raven anywhere else?u're not supposed to even be targetable in a cloaking transport ship so wtf r u talking about?if a pilot flies a hac or even t3 in low sec/0.0 and loses it, does the loss of the victim not hugely outweigh the loss of the attacker as well? should that stop him from ganking it simply because it would ""hurt"" too much?yes, they're not supposed to be easily accessible because of their massive buffer. and newer players shouldn't even be able to afford valuable cargo in the first place so by the time they do, they should've known how to safeguard it by now.if it's such a small sec loss, then why aren't there any threads crying about rookie ship/t1 frigate losses from suicide ganks? why r there still thousands of exhumers infesting the belts? that's what i thought.what exactly do u ""mostly"" carry that u can't split into smaller loads?high sec is not a 100% safezone completely separate from the rest of eve. u want safezones, go back to world of warcraft.right because -10s don't have mining alts to hide behind in high sec whenever they're cornered?refer to the top of the post.just like every low sec/0.0 player who baits then blobs?therefore, it is possible to stay safe in high sec. the problem is ppl's stupidity.for a long post, u sure didn't think any of this through."
5/3/2010,"this. the tyrannis insurance change is a hefty nerf to suicide ganking and i think it will reduce suicide ganking by a fair bit. right now if i am using a tempest to gank, i'll go for a hauler with 50m because why not my tempest probably costs 2-5m total after insurance. if after tyrannis, my tempest after insurance costs 20m, then i will not go for a hauler with 50m because i will receive on average 50% of drops so 20m loss for 25m gain is not worth the time. people will also stop smartbombing and killing shuttles/nothing for giggles because it will cost a decent chunk of isk to suicide.you might see a spree of people suiciding before the patch because these are the ""good ol' days"" of suicide ganking. in the future, newbies will huddle around a gatecamp fire as we tell stories about these days"
5/3/2010,"first, throw away suicide ganks (against something cheap) are done by alts that are trained up and disposed of, using a brutix (or similar), not a battleship.second, suicide smart bombs are done rarely. usually as part of some type of event or out of rage against shuttle hauler macros. this will happen regardless of insurance reimbursement.third, people mistake failed ganks in low sec as suicide ganks. usually it is a noob pirate or drunk pirate who made a mistake.tyrannis will likely not put a dent in true suicide ganks. unlikely that there will be some kind of spree right before tyrannis because people will continue doing them post tyrannis. what tyrannis will end, however, is the ""build a rokh, sd a rokh, make profit"" thing that has been going on for some time now."
5/3/2010,dont want to burst your bubble. but you have missed all 2 weeks old alts in tempests/maelstroms in uedama/sivala lately?
5/3/2010,"this is totally not supported.1) high sec is not supposed to be totally safe. eve = everyone vs everyone.2) you should not, under any circumstances fly a jump frieghter carrying large amounts of loots without an escort.period.if you fly a jf thinking it wont get ganked, suicide or otherwise, you are playing the wrong game. eve is a game that is about risk vs reward, always has been, always will be. one of the pillars of eve as a game is non-consensual pvp, deal with it.if people in your corp dont want to help/scout you, your corp sucks, and join a real corp that knows a person with the isk and piloting skills for jf usage is an important part of the industry backbone of their corp and will scout you, or, you can negotiate with some mercenaries to provide the escort you need.3) declare war on the corp that ganked you and take the fight to them, cost them what they costed you."
5/3/2010,posting in an original thread.:facepalm:
5/3/2010,"proposal:add a new rightclick menu option: move to labeldescription:allow us to assign a label to a mail and remove the original label in one click, through the current ""right-click on mail"" menu.the only difficulty with this proposal is what would happen if a mail you were moving was assigned to multiple labels.the simplest solution would be to only allow mails with one label assigned to them to be moved... orthe more difficult solution would be to add a new mail list setting:allow multiple labelled mails to be moved (set to off as default)if this setting is turned on, and you try and move a mail with multiple labels assigned to it, it would bring up a warning telling you that you are about to remove all labels and assign it to a new one.either solution works for me!pros:less clicks and micro managing.cons:none.

5/3/2010,yes
5/3/2010,thats awesome sauce!!!
5/3/2010,hmmmmmmmk then
5/3/2010,"ooh, nice idea."
5/3/2010,because he is trying to make the ship into something it was not intended for.does black ops need a boost? sure. giving it a covert cloak is not the solution.i do think increasing the range it can use the covert bridge would be very helpful.
5/3/2010,"lol, are u gallente? check out the sin.... a rifter is better than that ship...better proposal"
5/3/2010,"i have been thinking on this for a while now and if this is not meant to be posted here then i apologize for that but i searched and did not find anything on what i am about to suggest through the searches. i have seen many people in a situation where they have a low security status and are stuck in low sec/0.0 because they are pirates and they have a corporation or an alliance camping them in a station and it is hard for them to escape due to their security status therefore their game is pretty much ruined unless they can get a new clone in another low security system, that is if they can afford it. maybe ccp can implement a ""bribe"" option to bribe concord and lower their characters security status. if that is not possible then maybe put an option in account management where this is possible to increase your security status by paying a small fee of maybe $10 or lower, depending on how the rest of the community feels is fair or however ccp decides. please think on this idea.(edited the subject)"
5/3/2010,"i won't lie... this idea appeals to me. i would mean that i could go gcc more often on pirates and t3 flying nubs and not have to really do any ""carebear"" crap to recover from such wonderful transgressions.however, i can't support this for 2 reasons:1. the ""hardcore"" carebears will throw a fit... and with good reason. it basically means that people with a lot rl money can get a ""pass"" card for some of the general ****ery they commit in-game.2. there are already quite a few ways to raise one's security status, you just need to dedicate yourself a bit to doing them. some current ways of repairing sec status are: farming bs rats in null/low sec, do missions in the high-sec systems you haven't been banned from, and raise your social skills."
5/3/2010,"i support this proposal. i've thought for a long time that, in keeping with eve's environment of corporate greed, and it would be a good isk sink"
5/3/2010,this is the reason i can't support this. real life doesn't really reward this type of behavior(though reality tv sure does). you see it extensively in video games because by and large their isn't enough of a penalty for doing it and in some instances it's promoted.instituting something like this would be like televising a ufc or mma match at a suit and tie steak house. affliction wearing meat head douche bags don't mix well with others but often find the money to make even the best places suck for a few hours if given the opportunity.
5/3/2010,i understand what you're saying and i was thinking maybe it can done by raising the price on it the lower your security status is. and maybe make it so that the security status does not go back to 0.0 but raises slightly and gives a chance to maybe make it through at least .6 security systems and .5 systems.
5/3/2010,"this had been discussed in a 2-3 pages thread already but i am too lazy to find it.i just want to say ... all people who you kill got to work for their stuff, so do you.if you dont want to care about sec status, become a pirate or pvp in 0.0. or just grind yourself up. getting the sec status back to -2.5 or so doesnt take that long.not supported."
5/3/2010,to easy to suicide gank as it is.i do think u should be able to bribe factions for standing though
5/3/2010,"hello all,ever since warp to 0 was added to stream line travel it's had a negative impact as a side effect on pvp. now without unbalancing travel and making it to tedious here is what i propose.in high sec--> warp to 0 becomes 5km, still fairly easy to travel but leaves some room for error should u be at war with somebody. this distance is debatable.in low sec--> warp to 0 becomes 10km, more dangerous space so it's a bit tougher to travel but not abysmal still.in null sec---> warp to 0 becomes 5km, it is null sec and travel through it shouldn't be easy as pie, however, you can use dictors and warp bubbles so it doesn't need to be 10 by default. alliances using an ihub could change the warp to distances in systems they hold sov to increase or decrease it for varying levels of people based on alliance standings with max being 15 min being 5.in conjunction with these changes you would not be able to make bookmarks within 10km of an object such as stations, gates. you could still bookmark in belts etc."
5/3/2010,so to make it possible to suicide gank even with warp to 0?
5/3/2010,"negative side effect on pvp? could you elaborate as in how exactly? oh yeah you can't lock pods and shuttles landing to a gate now, a real shame."
5/3/2010,pirate/pvp***** tears are thebest tears tbh
5/3/2010,*sniff**sniff* still crying about that last pod you failed to catch at your pathetic gatecamp?like pirating needs to be any easier.
5/3/2010,the abuse of stealing an enemies pos password and gaining access inside is just plain stupid. this opens the door to fleets warping in and bumping out helpless super caps.remove this and simply add the option of who gains access inside your pos based on standings that you set on pos similar to how the pos decides to attack based on standings.
5/3/2010,yes and let blues come steals ur stuff then
5/3/2010,i'll just say this before this thread gets going - do not feed the troll.
5/3/2010,"wonderfull topic i must say, hahahaha.but, i'm just gonna ask you those questions though, and i hope you will answer it to just give a point on why you are creating those seriously ******ed posts.1. ok, why are you creating those topics at all to begin with?.2. why are you suggesting so ******ed ideas that the only thing you get back is flames and trolls?.3. why doesn't you think at least 10 secs before you post some ideas?. also think if such an idea would be good to have and so on.4. why are you making those topics when you know your stupid ideas wont get any supports at all?.5. why can't you just shut the hell up in here?.ok, that's 5 questions. i mean, everyone is free to give some suggestions / ideas as long they are fine and that. there is a boundary on when you don't need to post ideas at all here.but your topics is the same as i got killed by a rifter in my cynabal for example and then goes to this forum section and cry like a whiny ass baby to ccp that omgomgomgomg wtf, nerf rifter because he killed my cynabal.and on top of that you doesn't gives a damn to give any reasons at all why those things should be changed.not supported again and you will never get any supports by me ever. forget it."

5/3/2010,"i support this noble endeavour, but......use currier contracts."
5/3/2010,bump for the recent battles raging between sc and nc.
5/3/2010,"so, what exactly is there to do without a ship?run jobs (though you cant move goods to market or gather materials without a ship...)market trading (of course you cant exploit market differentials without a ship...)research agents (which is about the only thing you can do to full effect without a ship, though you'll need one to gain the standings first of all...)station spin (works best with a pretty ship, so you'll need to be in a market hub for best effect...)"
5/3/2010,"incorrect. you accused me of any number of exploiting in my thread when i ran for csm. among them you accused me of flying in stabbed and cloaking ships and bugging plexes without a shred of evidence.however, you did post an image of yourself happily flying in cloaked/stabbed frigate and not pulling an aggro from full npc spawn of caldari rats.and when we finally had enough of this crap and decided to show what could be achieved if done on industrial scale (amarr/minmatar front) it suddenly become a problem and exploit in your opinion and you wanted people banned for using it (see message from larkonis earlier). beforehand, you were quite happy to gloat about it's use in local and you even said in fanfest fw video that such standing exploit was only ""valid way' (your words at 3.54) to capture caldari plexes and pulled random numbers from your hat on how much isk caldari could farm from cosmos missions via plexing alts. damar rocarionbrigadier general"
5/3/2010,"this person is running for csm.!??!?!?!you want this person to be running your game.ankh has no idea of the workings of eve. she's a dhb wildcat ego with a carebear mentality - which is fine for representing those players - who pretends to know everything, when it's quite opposite that is not the case. prove that you know these things you say you know. prove to us you are competent in the ways of pirating, suicide ganking, and null-sec pvp that you claim to know so much about. i don't care how."
5/3/2010,"i know stuff about pvp and stuff!i do not capture plexes with cloaking frigates, that is lies.srsly.i mean, you wouldn't be catching half the flak if you just honestly said ""i'm a carebear candidate"" and be done with it."
5/3/2010,"actually being an outlaw puts very harsh limitations, so does the 15 minute global criminal countdown. pirating in low sec creates all sorts of issues, some of them can be circumvented partially, some can't, but in either case its a pain in the arse. of course you, or ankhsdfhdwosjifdsahiiuha or anyone who can possibly agree with her wouldn't have a slightest idea about this since they never tried it. which is fine on its own of course, but when one such person runs for a position with certain degree of power, starts mentioning deleting my characters and only not literally being in favour of it because it's ""impractical"" i'll be so bold to feel offended."
5/3/2010,"i heard cva had a large fleet battle last night.would the candidate care to comment on her participation in this particular action and 100's of other engagements over the last several months?this would allow us voters the chance to judge her ability to understand basics of nullsec combat, pvp **** fitting (oops did i say ****? i meant ship ofc), playing with others who dare indulge in said pvp (cuz ya know...thats pretty much what the ole sandbox is all about), and knowledge of fleet mechanics and lag?nahhh...didn't think so. i swear you must be the sole exception to the rule that ""all dutch folks are cool"""
5/3/2010,"wow so when you didn't like ultima online you ran your own server with all the the stuff you didn't like disabled. that's almost like some pilot in 0.0 running a packet filter to mask his presence in local, changing the game to suit their play style.and so the only way for you to change eve is for people to vote you onto the csm, but you're an extermist, it like voting for a republican because you don't like taxes and then finding out that you get all that christian fundamentalism hokey too.vote for anyone but ankhicantbebotheredtospellhernameright."
5/3/2010,^ this right here is why you can't claim to be running 'independent'
5/3/2010,"ha, like a democrat candidate in a room with republican voters.""i wonder why you don't seem to be in alignment with the people you are supposed to represent."" yeah, right."
5/3/2010,"erm...the cloak is off in that picture. it's perfectly legit to have a cloak fitted to your ship, as long as you're not using it to capture the plexes."
5/3/2010,explain to me how having an organization behind you make you 'independent'.
5/3/2010,"i was starting to think that maybe she had some good ideas, but this text for her is political suicide, you talk too much to the wrong people unfortunately, shame."

5/3/2010,"good info captain! this is quite sickening.i have some questions for ankhesentapemkah but i too don't respond to trolls, which i'm pretty sure she is at least you have the important political traits of not giving straight answers to uncomfortable questions and outright lying."
5/3/2010,"hi there, just thought i'd post and confirm that yes, that's me in that chat log and, yes, that's precisely how deluded ank really is when she thinks no one else will see it. the above chatlog is an excerpt from a corp chat from back when i was in afc, and part of what became kind of a corp in-joke about ank playing with her pp (puzzle pirates or something lame like that. anything she has to say about pvp is pretty much her talking out her backside, as a quick glance at her battleclinic stats will tell you she doesn't really have any, and she's got about as much integrity as a politician from louisiana. you'd be better of voting for me as a csm, but i don't think my platform of ""send me to iceland so i can get drunk and chuck bjork in the volcano to appease the lava god"" would get me very far.who am i voting for? i'm going to get **** drunk, put the names of all the candidates (minus ank, of course) on a dartboard, and best two out of three gets it."
5/3/2010,"so we have a csm wannabe which, out of the eye of the public, says that there's no reason to play eve because you can't leave your mark on the eve world and is not enjoying eve and puzzle pirates are a much superior game.interesting. on the other hand she's saying she'll represent all players (even politicians don't lie that much most of the time), and wants to meddle in pvp mechanics despite having zero clue about pvp (to the extent she's not capable of even fitting a ship semi-sensibly) or even participating when the alliance she's in is under attack.you know, if you just said ""i'm a carebear candidate"", well, ok, fine, i guess carebears want representation too. however, you wish to present yourself as a candidate which will represent everyone without bias (ha ha), which is political bs at its finest."
5/3/2010,"thing is, i'm willing to be even the most skittish carebear in eve understands that the pvp is one of the big draws of the game and that without it there wouldn't be much of a market for empire carebear produced goods. so a candidate that wants to massively hamper or even do away the pew pew fun times the rest of us like would be bad for carebear business.ank's not really representing anyone but herself and her own laughably deluded idea of what eve should be."
5/3/2010,"ankh is a geek of the worst kind. the kind of geek who's completly ignorant of what is going on but has the authistic idea of knowing everything betten than anybody else. this kind of geek doesn't know she's a geek. she even thinks she has strong social skills. she will sooner accept the reallity that everybody is wrong and she is right, than try to understand why people critizize her.nice typical behaviours she exhibits is of god syndrom when being in some kind of leadership position in a gaming community. running a uo shard, etc.ankh you are a sad person. get tf out of here and play other games. you are not helping here."

5/3/2010,you have my vote!
5/3/2010,"i think wormholes are a perfect combination of profit and drawback (i got tired of saying ""risk and reward""). i love fighting people in wormholes, it's like putting eve into a time machine where someone dropping a carrier on you made you say ""#@#! now i have to deal with this"". the one thing that i can find fault with is that there's a liiiitle too much seclusion for my taste. increasing the duration that wormholes are active, we're talking like 6-12 hours here, will both increase the chance of a confrontation and help the guys that live there with logistics. these are the kind of changes i like; fixing a slight concern without totally screwing the other party.about the wormhole sov upgrade not working, i think it's one of those issues that people probably don't realize exists. either the bug report fell under a stack of papers, or people forgot about it - either way i'll definitely be a voice for those ""little annoying bugs""."
5/3/2010,"hi corbeau, i have a question regarding your proposal to eliminate ship insurance.i agree with you on the concept that from a pvp'rs perspective a ship is a ship and if you can't afford it fly something else. why should i be able to pay 100m for a ship and not ""lose"" that isk when it dies when i can pay the same for another and lose it. people fly t2 cruisers that aren't worth insuring, for example, so why should bs be any different.so my question comes at you from an indutrialist perspective. the insurance value of t1 bs provided a floor to the value of the mineral basket. if you could not sell your minerals you could always make a bs, insure it and pop it. now this is not great for the game, because it floods isk into the economy, but without insurance why would you pay that much isk for a bs? demand would drop, causing the mineral basket to drop as well. this means that there would be even less point in mining for those that don't macro.now i know that there is no perfect answer because it's all estimation, but where do you see the balance point being reached? do you feel that ccp's ""adaptive"" insurance change will result in this balance point being reached slowly over time i.e. that the insurance price will lower to sit just under the bs value, which will fall to that of the insurance payout, which will lower insurance again, etc.?"
5/3/2010,what will be the carrot for low sec?can u you tell us more detail?
5/3/2010,summed up and expanded the issues which i care about in one giant wall of text blog post.
5/3/2010,vote? naw
5/3/2010,you have my vote t'amber :)
5/3/2010,get back to work maggot! i obviously don't give you enough things to do if you have time to post in here.
5/3/2010,the following pictures are some examples of issues/ ideas that are on my agenda.corporation shared bookmarks.
5/3/2010,"my questions for you:do you happen to be related to the famous d'ambrevilles of good old mystara?why do you like badgers so much? is there a story behind that perhaps? or are you ""just"" a fan of ""death badger"" (the character)? on your csmtest page (a really cool one btw) you do have a small dominion/badgerrun pic, could we get that a bit larger please?on a more serious note: on csm4 you sadly ""only"" made it alt and even then you have been more active than i few mains (as far as i can judge), so thank you for that!"
5/3/2010,"no. purely for writing ""all your vote are belong to me"""
5/3/2010,"er. no :| its just the theme for my current ships of eve event, i'm not really obsessed with them medium image"
5/3/2010,"hello avalloc,just a quick message to offer my support to your efforts for re-election.there has been some mention of the issues involving mining. one thing that i see that i really would like to see changes or at least clarified for my own knowledge is the problem of ""bot"" miners. is using a 3rd party program to run your mining ship day and night acceptable in ccp's view?the first time i lost a hulk in high sec during the first hulkageddon i was really taken by surprise. it was by a very well organized hunting pack that locked me down, warp scrambled me and had me sitting in my pod in under 8 seconds. i wont go into the details of my emotions moments after that. it has occurred to me after learning to live with it and then move on that hulkageddon is really the only true equalizer for honest miners and ""bot"" miners. as a hard core industrialist with 3 mining accounts i welcomed hulkageddon 2 with open arms. i watch their kill board daily hoping to see the names of the many ""known offenders"" bot mining, that i see daily while mining. but this still remains a ongoing problem because most bot miners don't use hulks.i am not sure what the answer is. do you have any suggestions or ideas on this?thanks,noceth-"
5/3/2010,"ccp doesn't find the use of botting acceptable and i plan to question them about their detection methods because i hear from a lot of players that mining bots a continuing problem.i would like to see a system added to reward miners for being ""active"" during the mining process. say add a small mini-game while the lasers are hitting the rocks. if you do well in the mini-game you'll pull in more ore than normally. this would help make mining a little more interactive too.thank you for your support, h tecon!"
5/3/2010,"your getting the last of my votes!gl, and hope to see you in the csm again dv!"
5/3/2010,actually i can hardly think of anybody better suited for the csm than a representative from eve university.not saying that all you politics will be for the sole benefit of eve university of course.
5/3/2010,"cin, you got my support, not just as a corp buddy, but as someone who stands behind your message and ideas. nice website too!"
5/3/2010,would vote for old cyno effect.....oh and hi prom.
5/3/2010,"i've known manalapan now for a couple of months. he's very honest, even though many think the contrary, and he is also quite charitable. i personally have seen him donate over 1 billion isk worth of true sansha pos to a struggling noob alliance, and also several hundred million isk worth of pos structures to habitual euathanasia. he has helped me personally with ship fittings and mission running, as i have also seen him do for others. he has great financial knowledge, as he proved while running dynasty bank, and also serious personal concern for the way eve progresses. anyone who doesn't vote manalapan for csm not only is a daisy fresh rookie, but also making the single biggest mistake of their gaming lives (with the exception of one champion miner). so look at what the other candidates are running for, and look at the age of their characters. i guarantee you will find neither a more deserving, nor qualified candidate for csm. manalapan, you have my vote."
5/3/2010,"i love the corpse launcher, it's exactly the sort of thing eve needs to stop it becoming bland."
5/3/2010,insti for cm5 or so( i think thats what i was suposed to say :p ) ( he gives me a carrier when he gets the spot so all vote plz ^^ )
5/3/2010,open discussion on:
5/3/2010,"so all i got from your post is you log on every once in a while, shoot some npcs or mine, occasionally join a fleet maybe and believe you respresent the average player.where is your website?what are the most pressing issues in eve?what do you think of the current state of 0.0?what are your thoughts on how to revamp lowsec?what makes you a better candidate than the other runners and why should someone vote for you?it really needs a little more :effort: to be honest."
5/3/2010,"q.where is your website? a. i am not going to bother with one. i would much rather play the game in my spare time than work on web-page design.q.what are the most pressing issues in eve? a. well, from the perspective of one who has participated in fleet battles, both small and large, i would have to say fleet lag. i really think this is an issue that need addressed before ccp moves on to some of the more grandiose plans that it has. they advertise for eve by showing these grand and glorious space battles that seemingly happen all the time. however, i have yet to see, or participate, in one of these due to everything locking up. hard to have a grand battle when nothing but your engines will fire.q.what do you think of the current state of 0.0? a. eve has always been, and always shall be a player run game, especially in the realm of null-sec. while i personally mourn the loss of the nrds system in providence, being as i was a resident there, i know that crap happens sometimes. i don't really want to get into the politics of all that, however, i will say that i think the sov system as it is needs to be looked at in a little greater detail. whereas it used to be ""too hard"" to take over a system now it might be a little too easy. my suggestion would be to make sov blockade units a little more vulnerable than they are right now. so that the attacking fleet has to put a little more effort in defending them.q.what are your thoughts on how to revamp lowsec? a. ah, low-sec. yes, i think every player would like to see a little more done with it than it being the no-fly zones where pirates hang out. however, i would not want to begrudge pirates their fun in eve either, even if i do not necessarily agree with piracy myself. i think it would be interesting to see concord or even empire to have a slightly more active role in low-sec being as these are their systems. perhaps they should have garrisons. military presence, but only limited, and reinforced only at downtime, modified so that players can engage their forces and take them out, but active garrisons that attempt to stop aggression from happening just like in hi-sec. this would make low-sec a little safer, but there would still be some risk, for jumping in you don't know if a pirate fleet has been pro-active enough to take out the garrison before conducting their illicit activities. i think this would still retain the gamble of low-sec, yet make it likely to be used more often.q.what makes you a better candidate than the other runners and why should someone vote for you? a. makes me better? i don't think that i am necessarily better than any of the other candidates. i am merely providing another option for voters, and hoping to add another fun aspect to gameplay for myself. i don't have a major agenda, and i am not in this for power. i would like to just be able to represent myself, and others, those who play the game for fun, not necessarily personal or corporate galactic conquest."
5/3/2010,^^^ what he said.-t'amber
5/3/2010,it's the drivel written by candidates that stops me from scrolling down. limiting text to a slogan and a few bullet points would prevent a lot of bleeding eyes.
5/3/2010,"this is an interesting point of view, but sovereignty gives some advantages that i list here in order of importance:1. outpost and conquerable station docking rights;2. jump bridges and cynojammers3. reduction of pos fuel consumption4. spercapital building rights.from my point of view it's right to have big battles for these objectives, thus big battles must be there, and always will. even if it's hard to do, we must find a way to split the engagements into smaller ones, with sort of battlegrounds. i disagree with mazziliu and think that my proposal could work is the numbers and details are tuned. i encourage the new csm candidates to have a look at my analysis of which i am very proud and sure. you may dislike the proposal i make, but i am confident that the analysis i do is correct."
5/3/2010,please come forward with ideas because neither us nor ccp could think of any fair ones in the (limited) time available for discussion of this topic.
5/3/2010,out of curiosity i'd like to know who you think will be getting seats in the csm5.please post your picks in order of who you think will get the most votes.i'll put them in order of popularity if this post progresses past idle fancy.seat 1 :seat 2 :seat 3 :seat 4 :seat 5 :seat 6 :seat 7 :seat 8 :seat 9 :-t'amber
5/3/2010,"seat 1 :alliance monkey 1seat 2 :alliance monkey 2seat 3 :alliance monkey 3seat 4 :alliance monkey 4seat 5 :alliance monkey 5seat 6 :alliance monkey 6seat 7 :alliance monkey 7seat 8 :alliance monkey 8seat 9 :alliance monkey 9on a more serious note ankh will get a seat due to lack of competition in the carebear category, there'll be a couple of candidates who care about smaller alliances and low sec (dierdra vaal and teadaze are both solid choices) and the rest will be alliance monkeys.it would be nice to see a dark horse like cinori aluben get a shot at csm."
5/3/2010,fyp
5/3/2010,"i actually have a lottery running on this topic - you can see it here. </shamelessplug>i put together a list of who i expected to win, in order of expected votes. 1) dierdra vaal2) ankhesentapemkah3) vuk lau4) omber zombie5) darius johnson6) mynxee7) teadaze8) sokratesz9) avalloci might want to tweak that list a bit, but it's still fairly close to what i expect."
5/3/2010,"i am from a small alliance and i care about industry and miningi would make a good csm, please vote for me!!!"
5/3/2010,"every time graphics updates get added, either in the form of art assets or engine updates you find a bunch of trolls/morons clamoring to 'fix teh lag first'. coding graphics engines and creating art assets are discliplines which are largely unrelated to attacking the network latency, process scheduling and database bottlenecks that are most likely at the root of the lag issue. point being, that pushing on this issue is unlikely to steal resources from other hot-topic issues.i believe it's an easy sell to ccp, the graphics engine is showing a lot of rough edges (jaggies) due to it's age and is turning off a number of potential new players. and the tiny font used everywhere is starting to become a big problem when people have 10"" laptop screens with 1080p resoultion. ui changes are a big part of my campaign, because ui design is interfering with people's ability to play the game.however, you should also be aware that some of the effects you describe are not things you see in deep space, when you're 10 au from a g type star the shadows aren't soft, they're very harsh. and dark too, black as a piece of coal at midnight on a moonless night, as an astronomer i'd like to see proper hdr implemented so that when you're sitting next to the sun or low over a bright planet that those stars and nebula fade away below the sensitivity of your visual dynamic range."
5/3/2010,"you are right, of course soft shadows should be used where appropriately, for example a temperate planet close to a star with think atmosphere would have soft shadows on it's surface because light is scattered and diffused in the atmosphere. sun should also fade, because at the moment it is the same size mo matter if you are 1 au or 100 au from it, clearly therre needs to be a difference.could you please provide me with a link to your campaign? i am interested."
5/3/2010,"back when i was working in astronomy i spent a lot of spare time doing concept cgi for my research, i would spend *forever* trying to get planetary lighting effects right in povray, i ended up patching the povray code to make it use double precision floating point for the final pixel values so that i could do proper postprocessing on my videos."
5/3/2010,"this is how you sell aa and a font change. if you can get the beancouters to think they can get more money, or keep less if it from leaving, then you will find that the technical issues become moot."
5/3/2010,this is my blog posting covering the rest of of my campaign issues should you feel inclined to support me. i'm not just about teaching 5 year old kids how to play eve.
5/3/2010,"you people can parade around these forums playing e-politics all you want. every single person that plays this game knows lag is the biggest issue that affects the most people every single day. i have 5 votes, now which one of you is going to grow a pair and tackle this issue head on? to prove my point think of how different pvp would be without the lag. - without lag you don't have to cycle guns. that means things die a lot faster and more of them. yes carebears that means you sell more ships and mods. - you actually get to load systems and carry out your intentions to fight. - campaigns in 0.0 actually move forward instead of stalemating because the enemy got in system first. more sov structures, pos, and ships die. again, good for the economy.- all the people in fw can actually enjoy large fleet engagements and rp themselves to death. - your precious little mission hubs in highsec will run smoother. - you station hugging war deccers won't blackscreen when you undock. the list is endless and affects everyone. it's quite obvious ccp agrees with me due to their mass testing to identify what causes the lag issues. so i ask again, who's going to represent the paying customer and team up with ccp/csm and make our gaming experience more enjoyable."
5/3/2010,someone who has never fired blasters in actual combat has no place trying to theorycraft their changes.edit: in clarification; this sums up one of the main reasons anyone who pvps in this game shouldn't vote for her.
5/3/2010,"lol, gotta love the hate.some people take **** far too seriously."
5/3/2010,see bottom of first post :)
5/3/2010,"any candidate who promises to get lag fixed is simply saying what you want to hear to get voted in.shocking revelation i'm sure firstly ccp are already working on the issues caused by dominion and reducing lag in general so nothing the csm say will get it done any faster. at csm4 summit we were shown graphs and things to say what they were working on but those haven't been made public yet...secondly most candidates are going to agree that lag needs to be worked on constantly (including myself) to make the game better. however all the csm can do is add one more voice to the already deafening crowd telling ccp that lag is bad.lastly the sad fact is that there is always going to be a maximum number of players that can participate in a single fight before lag hits and whilst that number grows so does the potential number of participants. gameplay changes to reduce the need/will to just throw more people into system are the only long term way to halt the spread, but that means artificial limitations and goes against the sandbox so have to be carefully considered.it is not a matter of csm ""growing a pair"" because only ccp know how their server and client code are reacting. csm can raise ideas from players as to how to tackle it and then lag will get put on the agenda so it can be discussed at the iceland summits. ccp will take it from there whilst the csm spend the rest of their candidacy looking at other issues.i would be happy to raise lag related issues but i won't promise to fix it because it is not in my power to do so. if that isn't good enough for your votes then so be it."
5/3/2010,"i asked for the csm to team up with ccp and find a solution, not claim to fix it by themselves. we all know ccp completely drops the ball on their own quite often. what they need is the csm to be the voice of reason and bring common sense to the situation. i think we can all agree a lot of the people working there aren't the brightest. something you see that is a simple fix they may not recognize right away because they're drowning themselves in code or whatever they do to confuse themselves. oh and this 24 hrs to reinforce systems is crap, but i'm not even going to get into that."
5/3/2010,"i wonder how many csm candidates have turned up on sisi to help during the fleet lag testing? that's one of the concrete things that csm candidated could be doing to fix lag, rather than making empty promises."
5/4/2010,black ops need some very specific boost:if you have ever been in a sb gang you would know that 95% of time you spend making bookmarks. black ops should be specialized ship for sb gang commander with particular functions for managing sb gang as:- faster sb deployment - i.e. faster creation of bookmarks for fleet members- more accurate sb deploument - ability to warp/fleet warp at distance to moving targets(ships)- cov ops cloak is a must- no need for high dps - dps will come from sb fleet
5/4/2010,"lolwut? you're confusing resists with ehp, i think. 1% ehp of a 100k tank would be 1k more effective hit points. how is that going to matter when you're getting hit by 400,000dmg in alpha strike? that's going to give you an extra microsecond? no, you're pretty wrong.then you might as well add lag back into the equation which brings dps back into the equation as the dominant arbitrating force because the team that is doing more damage (alpha or dps) will destroy more ships faster and 'win' in this extremely simplistic, hypothetical engagement that still has utterly no bearing on the op. you've clearly put alot of effort into this but at this point i'm going to leave you with the last word because it's quite clear you've forrest gumped the argument and run off the pitch and onto some train tracks."
5/4/2010,"a 1% increase in ehp will require 1% more dps to kill you within the same time frame. whether that timeframe is a millisecond or ten.if your targets have 100k ehp and you're doing a 400,000 alpha strike, then 75% of your dps is pointless. clearly you only needed 100k alpha and you have 400k. anything over the 100k alpha is then wastedif you're saying that ""omg the alpha is so high that their hit points never matter"" then at the same time ""omg the alpha is so high that our dps doesn't matter either"". if you add lag back into the equation then that reduces the effectiveness of your dps just as much as it reduces the effectiveness of your hit pointsas for the op.it appears, as we can see from page 6(the op's posts on it, near the top). that the op thinks that battleship engagement range within 50km is what we're discussing (and that, for some strange reason he thinks ac's can reasonably hit that far without te's) and is a valid ""scope"" that it makes sense to talk about the ""blaster"" problems.this is to say that the strength of railguns is within the scope of ""blaster"" problems and that makes this discussion relevant.i mean hell, this is taken directly from the op_____________the fact of the matter is this:you don't know what you're doing. you don't know why there is a problem with blasters. and you cannot hope to fix it before you educate yourself about the game that you're playing.blasters have not fallen in strength since their heyday. other weapons have not seen significant advancements that would put them out of commission. in the heyday of blasters 45km scorch still existed and the geddon still had 8 low slots and 5 heavy drones. in the heyday of blasters, vagabonds still out-ranged and out-sped deimos. in the heyday of blasters the rupture was still better than the thorax. in the heyday of blasters, the tempest still had its versatility and range advantages over the mega. in the heyday of the blaster you were still better off in a nano-domi.none of that changed. what changed was how people play the game. and blasters will never be what you want them to be until people stop playing the game the way they do now and they forget the knowledge that led them to make other choices.that last bit is a little harsh, there are boosts that can make blaster boats good again. but they don't have to do with damage or tracking or web speed, or ab boosts or any other sorts of convoluted junk. they have to do with making blaster ships proficient at prosecuting solo/small gang pvp and with systems that encourage those types of gangs to existyou would know this if you bothered to read the paper that i pointed you towards. but you don't because you don't seem interested in actually fixing the problem, you seem interested in getting a cookie. after which you're going to ***** that it wasn't as sweet as it ought to have been."
5/4/2010,"im not sure what heyday you are talking about. but before changes to siege launchers, added hp's to all ships, projectile ammo and clips, changes to tracking enhancers, before nanos first came around...you know back then... blasters rocked."
5/4/2010,"goumi is correct that these things were around back in the ""heyday"" of blasters (minus the ruppy being ""better"" than the rax... to some degree that is subjective. they both were/are good boats at different play styles).but, to be perfectly fair in our dissimination of information:-base em/exp resistances got changed (only a ""nerf"" to gallente as hybrids dont shoot either type. but they do have drones so its not that drastic....so long as you are in the situations where drone use is truely viable)-during that same patch amarr got a 15%dmg boost in addition to the resist change. (this may have been to lg. guns only...i forget tbh)-90% webs were nerfed. yes a web'd ruppy was still faster than a web'd rax prior to the nerf; however the speeds at which a ruppy could drift into falloff if caught meant that more dmg could be applied. this is coupled with the fact that at close range the speed (while faster than a rax) was not sufficient to cause blasters tracking issues-since the ""heyday"" (where according to goumi the ruppy was better than the rax)projectiles have recived boosts to dmg and tracking.imo blasters/rails are not omgcrappy in reality. however, the power creep that has occured leaves them slightly lacking even under prime conditions for thier use. they do not need large buffs to be competative."
5/4/2010,"1) changes to tracking enhancers boosted blasters relative to lasers and missiles. also boosted ac's more, but that advantage was irrelevant2) adding hp to ships makes blaster ships better not worse. any time you extend the length of fights you increase the strength of high damage/short range weapons.3) nano's didn't ""come around"". they were always there. people just did not understand how strong they were. this doesn't have as large an effect as you would think on the viability of lasers compared to blasters in the area where blasters could have an advantage.mainly it served to make scorch better, but scorch isn't typically used in small fights as much as it is in larger ones(except as an opener). in those instances lasers were better anyway. for the sphere of influence of blasters, the changes were much smaller since it was dampened by the thermal damage on mf and drones.this simply did not happen. there was no strict damage boost to amarr for any weapons. there was a tracking boost( a big one), but that had little effect on applied damage intra class. and even with relative tracking blasters have a big advantage.the drift on webs has nothing to do with the amount it slows you down. if they were drifting out of web after then they're drifting out of web after. the rupture was not better than the rax simply because of webs. the rupture was better simply because it was better at everything that the rax did.bonuses to damage and falloff yes, not bonuses to tracking(bonuses to ammo you won't ever use does not increase your tracking)the ""laser changes"" that made a difference(with respect to the strength of blasters) was really the boost to the zealot from a 4 turret ship that was worthless to a 5 turret ship that had a role. the omen also got boosted but it wasn't really enough to make it not ****ty. the reason that amarr battleships were good after was not because they got boosted, but because they were good before.the issue is that people have realized that that play style that the rax occupied is weak. not that it was not weak before.if you got rid of all the laser and ac changes(barring the zealot), people would still prefer pulse ships and ac ships over blaster ships. people do not realize why this is the case and cannot reconcile that choosing a race should be about choosing what you want to do rather than changing their choice of race to do what they want is why none of these solutions will fix anything, or will break more in the process.its why the blanket laser changes were bad, its why the blanker projectile changes were bad, and it will be why blanket blaster changes will be bad if they go through."
5/4/2010,"i am going to briefly throw myself into this verbal melee while i'm good and drunk.all of the fcs that i know will opt to go ""overkill"" and launch all 400k of that dps at on target rather than waste time wondering how much of a tank the enemy ships have or many of his/her ships will be needed to kill each one of the enemy's and call separate targets for different squads, etc. so yeah, once you go over a certain amount of people on either side of a battle (i'm talking more than 100 on either side) then unless you are in a capital, any tank is pretty much worthless.once you bring those numbers down to something more sane (say, 20 on 20?), then ehp becomes a vastly bigger factor.that said, i do wonder what this has to do with blasters. good sir, i took the liberty of checking your killboard. you have never once used a gallente ship. or blasters or railguns for that matter. all you have every flown have been amarr laserboats and rifters.this leads me to conclude that you have been using eft numbers this whole time and have no real experience in actually using them in a real combat environment.i invite you to try flying nothing but thoraxes, brutixes, and megathrons for a month using only hybrid weapons. let us see how well you fare.however blasters, and hybrids in general, have not been given any ""buff"" either... not like the other weapon systems.player choices were also fueled, in part, by changes made the game as well. they go hand-in-hand. when lasers were buffed people realized that, in exchange for a 10% to 15% decrease in damage, they could fire at 3x the range of blasters and completely avoid the 10km ""zone of death."" and if anyone got too close to their ""medium range"" laserboats, scram/web them and tracking no longer an issue.i've said it before, i'll say it again: as eve grows and gains new players solo combat will become rarer and rarer. why? because people find safety in numbers. it's human nature (i call it the ""herd effect""). and even if you try to artificially prevent this people will find ways around it (always have, always will). this leaves gallente boats in a odd situation as they are technically geared towards small scale/solo combat.so you are right in that fixing blasters and/or hybrids in general won't ""fix"" things with the game overall. but it is simpler to tinker with one weapon systems and to see what happen rather than to screw with an entire line-up of ships, much less the game mechanics themselves. and none will guarantee anything."
5/4/2010,"i want to take a little bit of time to explain why this might be true.imagine for a second a game that looks like so. p1 and p2 are the players, c and h are the choices and (x,y) represents the payoffs to player 1 and player 2. p2 c hp1 c (0,0) (-1,1) h (1,-1) (0,0)such that if player 1 chooses c and player 2 chooses c, each person has a payoff of 0.now, in this situation the obvious choice to do the best is to choose h. if payoffs are changed such that the game now looks like so. p2 c hp1 c (0,0) (-1,2) h (2,-1) (0,0)the obvious choice is still to choose h. this is what the changes to lasers and ac's largely were. the problem was that before the changes, people were not seeing the game as i described above, but were seeing the game as if it was advantageous to choose c. only after the changes did they realize that h was the better choice, even though h was a better choice all alongthis is roughly what has happened here.i mean, before the laser changes what were the problems with lasers? if i was to be believed the problems lay in issues with downfitting, capacitor use for new players, the ease of fitting omni tanks, and the fact that the sub-bs ships sucked ass(harbinger excluded).i have certainly changed my views since then. i have become more in favor of boosting cruisers in radical ways, i have given up on the whole ""making lasers not totally suck for newer players"" thing. and i care less about omni tanks(and their effect on minmatar or amarr) for a variety of reasons.but the point still stands. the changes to lasers that went through had little effect on the strength of laser ships(probably only really having an effect of boosting the harbinger) relative to others. it did not boost the things that needed to change (omen, prophecy, maller, punisher, etc still suck) because those things even after the changes were not good enough to reasonably use and did boost the things that didn't need to be changed (anyone saying that the abaddon or geddon needed to have more true dps was smoking illicit substances).the same can be said for minnie and the projectile changes. did the rupture, rifter, vagabond, and hurricane really need range expansion and damage increases? did the tempest, maelstrom, and typhoon? could changes to the maelstrom/pest have been made to make the mael a better sniper and the pest a better ac ship without boosting the rest of the ships? yea, i bet that could have happened. but it didn't, and its because people whether good intentioned or not, keep thinking that they can just change damage and tracking on a whole class of items and make things ""good again""this is what blanket changes to blasters/railguns will be. if you do it you will just be setting up the next stupid whine about how some other weapon system is underpowered(probably still blasters frankly)"
5/4/2010,"the point was that both tank and damage is pretty much worthless in that situation. since you have so much overkill anyway neither matters.but eventually it will matter as you say, and when it does, they both matter and they both matter in the method that i describedand you think that would change if you just increased their weapon strength? yea, it would not. also, blasters are after missiles, medium ac's and recons. blasters don't fit my play style and probably won't for quite a while. not an issue with them per se as it is me making a choice. even if they were boosted as you want i would not choose themeasier to tinker with them?no. its much harder to tinker with them than it is to tinker with individual ships. when you tinker with one ship, one thing in the system changes. that you're simply doing it 3-4 times doesn't matter. when you tinker with weapons, everything in the system changes, even what you don't want to changeits actually much easier to change the system to encourage people to fight in smaller groups than you think. but if you want to do that you might have to attempt to understand how people make choices relating to how large their gangs are. the link in my sig might be informative to that point."
5/4/2010,"agreed, blasters hould be upgraded.all i am saying is the blaster need some serious tweaking to bring it in line with other turret type weapons!"
5/4/2010,"i miss the ""omg that megathron is approaching me!""-moments...supportet: blaster dps boost; need for close-facemelting weaponnot supportet: range boost; no need for another midrange weapon"
5/4/2010,"sorry to say it, but that time is over long time ago.you wont see a blaster mega like that again.the reason for it is the few hp boosts that ccp have done.but still, i can still feel a little like that when i'm facing a neutron mega in my dual 650mm tempest. so it's still scary in that way."
5/4/2010,blasters need change - more damage&tracking; less rangedeimos needs more ehp to make it alive during approach to target
5/4/2010,"sure a neutron mega isn't that funny sitting next to u and firing away, but not much scarier than an abaddon or a raven (examples) which both have that bbq-sphere of the mega but bigger ones^^ i just think mega and other blaster platforms should be much more of a threat when in optimal than other mid range ships."
5/4/2010,"well, when we are talking mega vs tempest here, then in fact the mega is 5 times more scary than the abaddon is to my tempest, simply because the em and the thermal resists on the tempest is quite high and the abaddon doesn't do much damage to me then. it's the same with other ships that takes em and thermal damages.this is tested many times. i'm not even scared to 2x raven's that shoot em torps, because last time that happened, i tanked both of them, since my em resist is pretty high, so i tanked them with 1x lar ii."
5/4/2010,with the new insurance in next expansion it is possible that the rokh will be even more costly vs apoc.railguns/ships already bad+this would completly eliminate rokhs from the fleets :(hopefully in the following winter expansion ccp will fix this issue too.
5/4/2010,1) rokhs aren't more costly vs apoc's2)insurance changes are unlikely to do anything of the sort. ccp is shooting for 100% insurance of tech 1 ships
5/4/2010,"1,only if you buy the hull+insure it fully and loose it before insurance endsrokh costs more minerals to produce--> less rokhs from the same amount of minerals that means it is more costly,even if you get back the same amount of iskif you dont insure it for full it costs moreif you dont loose it before insurance is over it costs moreif you/your corp produce it ,it costs more minerals2, insurance currently you buy the rokh pay 30% of its full insurance value --> it gets blown up you get 100% insurance valuerokh example:rokh cost 114.5m in jita +49.5m for full insurance(30%)=164m and you get back 165m in insurance --> you have +1m isk after you blow it upafter expansion:in the dev blog it says they will change the 100% insurance value to actual market price lvl ,with current it is 115mso after expansion:you buy it 114.5m + insure it for full (30%*115m)=34.5m and get back 115m --> you loose 34mso around 30% of its market valuse and as apoc cost 80m vs 115m rokh the insurance difference will be around 10mso that more a rokh would costat least this is what i get to from that dev blog, we can see it fully after the expansion is outfrom dev blog : ""we have our own ideas for how much of the full insurance value we want to payout for each ship class which generally is 100% for tech 1 ship groups, 20-60% for tech 2 and 100% for tech 3 ships (those this is only a portion of the value of the entire ship since subsystems are not included currently). however we are interested in your feedback on what you think they should be for each ship class and why."" and""yes, ship insurance will now revalue itself periodically based on a trimmed mean of the ship's manufacturing materials global market weighted average prices.""btw what ccp should do is drop the stupid tier system it is wrong in most ways"
5/4/2010,"the cost of the minerals is aggregated into its market price. if the final price you pay after insurance is not more then the mineral costs are not significantly more. there is no reason to not fully insure a fleet shipyour rokh is likely to last longer than apocs (for various reasons). this means that if you're doing cost by time comparisons the rokh will always look better.mineral market costs, but yes. either way, expect prices to adjust such that their real price after insurance is the same.also, at +10m for the hull you just about make up the extra cost of ammo(due to crystals) for the apoc, so you're still even."
5/4/2010,make rails rock!
5/4/2010,wow you really don't have a clue what your talking about do you? lol!just so you know goum the 100% payout is after you pay for the insurance which means the return is 100%-cost. ccp is aiming for zero insurance fraud and a player based market not 100%+ total return and a mineral floor like we have right now.this means that cheaper more useful ships will be even better after the insurance revamp and limited role ships will fall even further into obscurity.

5/4/2010,"there are easier and far less intrusive ways to detect macros than to scan the entire computer for macro software.a macro will repeat on the exact same time cycle (as someone pointed out earlier regarding a jita scammer). the clicks will happen on the same pixel of the client every time. and so on.at some point, a macro miner needs to unload their cargo hold. all you do is start a timer when they do so, and count the exact time to the next command, and what that next command is. if the time gap is always the same, and the next command is always the same... then you've got a macro issuing the commands.macro miners might respond by making more complicated macros that rotate through different time gaps in unloading the cargo hold. but eventually it will repeat. and given that all you're tracking per unload is the number of milliseconds and what the next command is... you can easily store a sequence of 10,000 pauses after unloading. and easily scan for the kind of repetition that indicates a macro is being used. once you suspect that a macro is being used, and know the repetition cycle, you can go through and record time gaps between each keystroke and each mouseclick, the specific pixel of each click, and so on, in order to get whatever level of proof you feel comfortable with in order to ban the player.all of which can easily be built into the client."
5/4/2010,"i have to disagree here - i fully agree about banning rmts, but not that macro miners don't matter. either macro use is within the bounds of the game (and therefore a legitimate activity available to all players), or it is not.macro users (all kinds, including miners, ratters, missioners, traders and scam spammers) have access to income that is not available to players who stick to the game rules. it gives them an advantage over others because their extra income will mean they are more able to sustain economic losses, buy more expensive equipment, take more risks, and spend more time doing whatever they want with less concern for cost in isk.when i reference ""game rules"", i'm not talking about concord's rules of operation, suicide ganking, piracy, scams etc - these are all within the bounds of the game, and there are in-game consequences for them that apply across the board.an example is a player (player x) who has a macro ratter running belts in an empty 0.0 system. x will have enough income to pay for plex for two accounts, and lose many ships so every second they are online, x can afford to go out roaming low/null, empire wardeccing, and generally blowing up other people's stuff without first having to make isk in some legitimate way.in the meantime, x's targets may engage x, but their ship losses need to be paid for somehow so they have to spend their time ratting/mining/missioning/trading, while all the macro user has to do is source another ship to go back and grief/harass.so, my main concern is that all players are playing the same game with the same rules/boundaries, and the same restrictions/constraints, whatever those rules/boundaries, restrictions/constraints may be."

5/4/2010,"lol..yeah. here's me full of fear!!!!!111!!!1 i said i support the concept of it because i agree it would be fun (read: i'm not scared). i simply said i do not think the game in its current state will support a reasonable implementation of what is being requested.nice poo-flinging, though. that was impressive."
5/4/2010,"and do you also believe that a couple new no-local 0.0 regions should not be added, because if you can't enjoy them, nobody else can?"
5/4/2010,"i don't believe i even discussed that possibility in any way. it wasn't proposed in the op.i doubt seriously ccp would ever do it, but i certainly wouldn't care if they did.the op put forth the notion that all 0.0 and low-sec should have delayed local because it works in w-space. that's about as fallacious an argument as you're likely to find on the subject of delayed local in 0.0/low-sec. that is what i have commented about. nothing more. dial back the froth, take a chill pill and quit assuming things about me. you don't know me, what i like or what i want. to the extent i think it's necessary and germane to the topic at hand, i'll provide such information."
5/4/2010,i can't believe i am even posting in this thread but absolutely not. you can't be biased against how people want to play the game. what if ccp and its intese love for pvp said everyone with a possible sec status had to pay more for their subscription. it is a terrible idea.

5/4/2010,"electronic attack frigs are pretty much a weaker version of the recon ships and uses the same set of skills apart from its electronic attack frig skill rather than the covert ops skill + reoon ship skill.i think rather than having them as a seperate ship type they should be counted as a third covert ops ship including changing the skill needed to fly them to covert ops. also as they are so similer to recon ships apart from being smaller and weaker, they should be given the option of using a covert ops cloak and be able to use a black ops jump portal. this would give covert ops team ecm support in the form of frigs rather than the larger ships."
5/4/2010,"while i support this initiative, i disagree that the skill should be changed. i would also be amenable to them simply fixing the ships to not suck so bad. even the comparatively awesome sentinel is really really sucks. it's important to remember that these ships are *frigates* - and an oversize fat frigate is a dead frigate. i don't even care how they fix eafs.-liang"
5/4/2010,"instead of giving them the covops cloak, how about giving them more base hitpoints so they arent as flimsy as they are atm?"
5/4/2010,"no, they should not.if you want a cloaky surprise ********* option then skill for it and pay a hundred mil+."

5/4/2010,"already being addressed.the vast majority of suicide-ganks are done in bs's, where the bs pilots get back most of their investment by the insurance system.tyrannis is changing the insurance system, and is reducing payouts on battleships. devblogthat will make it more expensive to perform suicide-ganks, and hence less profitable.how much will this change things? we won't find out until a few months after release. some of it depends on the degree of payout reduction. the mineral-price recalculation will certainly reduce payouts, and it remains to be seen how much of an additional ship class based reduction there will be.will it be enough of a change? maybe.the only reasonable thing to do with this issue is to wait to see how the tyrannis changes impact the situation, and revisit the issue in several months."
5/4/2010,"and exactly where in that same 1+ month old devblog does it say anything about battleships at all, let alone, nerfing insurance or r u just being a tool?"
5/4/2010,"for the reading disabled:""so ship insurance will be marked to market?yes, ship insurance will now revalue itself periodically based on a trimmed mean of the ship's manufacturing materials global market weighted average prices. this means the insurance quote when you are buying insurance will be now estimated and may change if the payout occurs during the next insurance period""meaning no more payouts which are larger then the market cost of the minerals, which is why some t1 ships are close to ""free"".currently you have the situation where insurance payout-insurance cost is roughly the same to the market price of the ship which makes the ship free, which will no longer be the case. throwing bs around will now definitely cost some isk, most likely around 15m per bs or 20m per bs."
5/4/2010,"no, the real newb here is you. recycling alts is definitely against the rules and every suicide ganker knows this. i certainly know this, but you do not, gee that's telling. the recently boosted artillery make a perfect suicide ganking weapon. a tempest can one shot any mack and most hulks. checkout hulkageddon, tons of the kills were made by solo bs.sb attacks happen often in highsec by -10 players since they don't have time to wait for targets, then need to smartbomb whatever is there. i am not sure what you are smoking, but no one is going to throw 3+ bs to suicide shuttles if the bs costs you 20m or more each to suicide. i'm not even sure what a macro shuttle hauler is. have you played this game? you haul stuff in shuttles with a macro? right.there are a few groups that do suicide in groups of t1 cruisers and t1 destroyers and the like and they will be the cheapest to operate and they will not be affected much. but don't kid yourself, a lot of the suicide gankers are t1 bs and t1 bc right now and the cost for suicide ganking in those is going way up. this is really basic logic, but if the cost goes up people are either: going to stop, do it less, be more choosy about their targets. all of these result in less frequency of suicide attack.thanks for playing, but i know far more about this subject than you, i've done it all baby"
5/4/2010,"i had to laugh.on subject:less payout for bs may reduce them being used for baby-ganks on barges and such stuff. but you dont need them for this anyway.still it matters little for freighter and mission runner ganks. as it has been said a few posts before, if a bs costs you 15-20 mil you might think twice before popping a 50 mil industrial but it makes virtually not difference on the bigger stuff.thats why i too, support the simply with concord no insurance proposal. thereby its still lucrative to gank the juicy targets but at least the loot fairy has a say in it. also still no one is save in highsec, but the possibility, that there is a real reason behind a suicide gank other than the laughs and 100% chance to make profit hopefully increases."
5/4/2010,virtually no difference? cool story bro.
5/4/2010,"elaborate? but let me do it for you with one example:one corp with at most 10 bs gank another bs (overkill scenario, mostly 5 are sufficient). their last 12 s-kills executed in the last 2 weeks made between 14 and 4840mil with an average of 1bil per kill (values according to battleclinic). investment per char after insurancenow: 5milafter: 20mil<U+FFFD>-return through loot per char and kill100milthat translates into a decrease of profit from 95mil to 80mil per kill, wow. what im saying with virt. no difference is, thats its still a no-brainer.come to think of it, now that i actually did the math for the first time. anyone willing to pair up and suicide a bit?"
5/4/2010,"it just simply means that ppl won't be making a profit from buying a ship, insuring it, then self-destructing it for a profit. and no matter how that ship was gonna get blown up, the net cost, even with a reduced payout, will be the same because in that case, it was already cheaper to begin with anyway. but hey, way to talk out of your ass (especially with your imaginary numbers) just like another tool who also tried that same exact crap."
5/4/2010,"would have to see the killmail on this one, i note the op has disapeared from the thread and has only made 4 or 5 posts ever and dosent know the name of his alliance mate?i would like to see this out of interest as a jf has more structure, shield and armor to start off with then a normal freighter and geta a 10% bonus to hp per jump freighter level.this makes it a very tough hitter in highsec i would like to see how many bs were used to kill it. he also claims ""only one agressor got a standings drop"" (whut) and when he claims that his mate lost ""a billion isk in credits"" the split between the amount of pilots needed to kill the ship would be penuts. basically im calling bs on the opskunk"
5/4/2010,"i like how you all are saying that concord isnt meant to protect its meant to punish...that wasnt always the case. concord are the police, were the police and would turn up lightening fast and protect. however, even if there has been this change in roles, concord arent punishing anyone. there is no major loss for the pirates doing the ganking. they get their insurance, go by more ships and do it all again.i think that a insurance contract should be null and void if the ship is destroyed by concord. ie, the contract expires, but pays nothing back to the player if it was concord that blew them up. its not unreasonable to say or do that. you think if someone gets in a high speed chase with the police and is forced to run your car off the road thus totaling it, do you really think the insurance company pays for the car to be replaced in that instance? no, of course not."

5/4/2010,"am i the only one that is totally bored of these patchs that are aimed at the carebear. imo the last 3 patchs (arguably excluding t3 and sov changes) have been solely based on satifying the urge of the cearbear.planetary int. rorqual, orca, sov changes, probing, wh space... the t2 bs atm are only really for those who run missions and used as a jump bridge. supercap buffs cant really be classed as pvp based.i think its time for some decent headway in the pvp genre. another dictor? commandship? even another bc and destroyer would be nice!! another type of capital ship, faction frig, t3 frig? another type of weapon? beam? remote explosive? timed shield placement? mini sieging? please ccp?sure this game is mean to be played as a gang, but what about those people who like to do it solo once in a while.this post is kinda fragmented and doesnt tackle one specific angle, i want discussion, not trying to win an argument. just want to get some opinion."
5/4/2010,1. many people use t3 in pvp. you dont?2. super cap boost was definitely a boost for pve. also people use their supercaps even less than before dominion.3. probing changes... really made the live of pvpers worse. the time it takes now to probe out ships went down significantly.4. sov changes not pvp related?i just wonder ... you play the game right?so far ... nothing to support here. the proposal is way to unspecific. maybe start the discussion in features & ideas?
5/4/2010,then you started it in the wrong forum.features and ideas is a couple rows further down the forum.
5/4/2010,"let's see what was in those last three carebear patches. 1) dominion. an overhaul of 0.0 sovereignty mechanics, a change to supercapital weaponry to make fleet fights less stupid and motherships more effective, the fleet finder to make building those 200-man fleets easier, and a massive, across-the-board buff to faction ships. carebears got...an exploration tutorial. 2) apocrypha. an addition of 2500 new 0.0 systems with delayed local, which are the basis of a new production chain that makes awesome cruiser-class ships. new scanning mechanics that dramatically shorten the amount of time it takes to probe someone out. the carebears got a new and interesting type of rat, but it's a type of rat that basically forces you into cynojammer-takedown tactics at the high end. 3) quantum rise. server-side changes which created the possibility of reinforced nodes for fleet fights. the speed nerf that pvpers had mostly been asking for for years. weapon grouping, which everyone loves, but which also has some very positive effects on lag. and bombs got a lot cheaper. carebears got...one mining support/hauler ship. so yeah, what are you talking about?"
5/4/2010,"yeah sorry. obviously this is in the wrong section.and tbh. t3 is out of the price range of most people to use in everyday pvp. so are supercaps. so are t2 bs. sov changes are not exactly pvp related. i wouldnt call shooting at stations and pos's fun or pvp. probing it mostly for plex's and wh space, if u checked the % of gangs that go out for some fun id say that a high % dont have probes. we've been using the same ships and weapons since the game started. just wanting something new to play with. maybe if they revamped assult frigs id be happy, but i think its more than that.ill ask a mod to move the post."
5/4/2010,"""carebears"" got the orca, will be getting planetary interaction, and loot rebalancing.calling the last few expansions ""industrialist"" is a ****ing joke. loot rebalancing is the first serious look ccp has taken at rebalancing the aging mining proffession.when ccp comes out with a real industrialist expansion, maybe then you can whine a little."
5/4/2010,"carebear, someone who does not wish to pvpso this is another wannabee pirate/pvp***** that thinks eve should be played his/her wayand again pirate/pvp***** tears are the best, i could bathe in them"
5/4/2010,"you do realize, all the ships you fly are made by industrial players?i mean i reactivated my account a couple of weeks ago and started pvping, but i dont mind more industrial patches if it means replacing my ships become cheaper."
5/4/2010,please don't define 'industrialist' as 'carebear'. there is a difference. there hasn't been a major expansion which has really dealt with the industry side of the game in....ever.industry ui overhaul pweeeeeezzzzz!!!
5/4/2010,"this wont stop macro laming but it will make macros useless to the point where people wont need them, theres three types of macros, the ratter (90% of 0.0), the hauler and the miner (90% of empire).macro makers find ways to make macros easily and will creatively continue, so we have to look at what people use macros for.i am not sure why people macro haul, probably for trade goods or something anyway macro mining / ratting is done purely for isk so i say we do the following.buff mining make asteroids contain more than mission junk, so much more that you would be able to make equal amounts of isk from mining than missionswe should then increase the amount of minerals required to make stuff for the obvious reasons like about 50% or something.so where do macros and ratter come in?have it so each ip is only allowed to mine / rat soo much a day, they can go over that quota but once they do they will go into a 'siege' (farming siege) where they ship wont move until dtin addition to this, they should get announced to all people in that region by both channel notifications and mail, they will also have aggression, since shooting rocks is classed as hostility to asteroids.this means miners / ratters can be attacked if they mine / kill too much and wont be able to move / warp / log off.when the ship dies or dt happens they can mine / rat again because of this freedom i think a quota limit of 2 hours is fine."
5/4/2010,are you serious about this one?
5/4/2010,0/10
5/4/2010,"yes, what purpose would a person use a macro, using one for 2 hours is pretty pointless, this will make macros inefficient"
5/4/2010,"so my ceo tells me ""fix your sec status problem"", atm i could do power ratting for 3-4h a day and get my sec status fixed in a few days (depending how bad i had been before *whistles*).with your plan the required time would double/triple easily.also what about people enjoying mostly pve in the game. 2h/day and then we tell them ""come back tomorrow""?how about normal miners who dont use macros? 2h/day and then we tell them ""come back tomorrow""?how idiotic is that?"
5/4/2010,"people enjoy mining :o i was being generous @ 2 hours, but its fine, you can still mine for longer, if you are mining in a fleet and you go over your quota you will experience industrial pvp, perfect to merge pvp and pve together. mining will be buffed ofc so 1 hour of mining will be the equivalent of 10 hours now, macros will just be useless, no one will pay for a macro to do what they can do quicker in an hour.as for ratting, with the warping from hostiles etc, 2 hours would be plenty of time, the problem is people are leaving macros on for a long time because they are useful afk tools, imagine getting a program that does two hours worth of work a day only, some people would still use them but the numbers will be soo low.the ip filter will limit isk seller companies from selling, sure they will be able to use proxies but is that really worth the effort for 2 hours a daythis would increase the price of zydrine too making lowsec mining better"
5/4/2010,"0/10i rat and mine and i do both for more than 2 hours a day when i do it. lets just take the mining side.i use 2 accts so that means the most optimal for me is the setup i use. hulk/orca as most will agree will mine more than hulk/hulk. it takes even with tech 2 crystals and drones mining with a max boost almost to over a hour depending on belt density to fill a orca. with your proposal i am only allowed to mine 2 maybe 3 orcas of ore a day. when if i am on a project to build a lot of things i can easily on the weekends spend 10~12 hours a day mining. mining already has a hard time keeping up with some l4 and most l5 missions on the isk per hour ratio. what your talking about would mean i can mine 2 hours a day per character meaning i would have to train my miner to fly the orca and my orca pilot to fly a hulk to max ability so i can now mine for 4 hours a day and then i would have do something else the rest of the time i want to play that day.while i agree something needs to be done about macro miners etc.. i am not going to grace the rest of your post with a response because i agree with many of the people opposing you already. and as for doubling the mineral cost of ships and mods..... let me know when you want to pay for a 120 million isk drake or a 2.1 billion isk freighter, just triple or more the cost of everything on the market at the tech 1 level and double the cost of tech 2. that is what you will see happen.edit for spelling and grammar."
5/4/2010,"so really what you are saying is we should try it out and if it doesnt work revert back to the old method, sounds good to me tbh."
5/4/2010,"wow, i've rarely seen such poorly thought out ideas posted in the assembly forum. this is epic fail in so many ways, my lunch break couldn't possibly leave me enough time to write it all out.i'll just leave it at epic fail, leaving it to the masses to inform you why.back to work."
5/4/2010,"not supported, if i want to travel/mission with one account and mine with the other, i do not wish to be have to stop that."
5/4/2010,"judging by the comments i think people will be happier if the limit was increased to 4 hours instead i will edit my original post to reflect this.i also thought rats should spawn more and give less of a loot / bounty, this would make ratting open to everyone so alliances wont have to restrict space to corps only"
5/4/2010,how is just drop this idea and think of a different way to try and stop macros. you start putting limits on what people can do for a given time and they will go find a different game that does not care if they sit around for hours in one location doing the same thing over and over when their rl is too busy for them to be involved in more active parts of the game.
5/4/2010,"there were days when i was still working on my master's degree that i would mine while writing papers, sometimes 8 - 10 hours a day on the weekend. so basically what you're telling me is that my subscription money doesn't entitle me to the same playing time as yours unless i am engaged in activities you agree are of limited interest to macro users.how about you stop drinking those dumbass shakes in the mornings? that might help."
5/4/2010,fyp
5/4/2010,if anything this is a reason to not vote for cat.

5/4/2010,"harold's example of neutral rr having the swaying power of ecm/damp/scramming someone without concordokken is a very legitimate comparison; and manalapan's elaboration that an aggro-timer would result in nothing but squads of rr'ing hospital domi mercs interfering with a war they didn't pay to be a part of is also a valid point. the docking timer will do nothing but stop the lone logi ship alts, which are simply the tip of the iceberg in this problem. the only example (in hisec) i can even consider as a defense as to why someone not in your alliance would need to be rr'ed would be the pair of dudes running a mission as a dps/logi partnership who aren't in the same alliance. but isn't that what an alliance is for in the first place? that extremely small case is the only example of someone being screwed over by harold's proposal. it wouldn't affect nullsec, and lowsec itself needs a look @ as far as rr'ing someone -10 with no gcc anyway, so that is a discussion for another time.tl;drharold is right, and only people who want neut rr are people using it.ps manalapan for csm."
5/4/2010,"i especially liked the part where to op acts like he knows what he's talking about. speaking as someone with a hell of a lot of experience with neutral rr- both being used for me and being used against me, let me say this:the only sensible fix to the rr mechanic is to have any rring ship ""inherit"" the docking and aggression timers of their target. in other words, rather than creating its own timer, it should copy the timer of the person being rred. rr already inherits the aggression timers of the target, but what it does not do is inherit the docking timers.example: i shoot someone once, and they shoot back. i decide i want to deagress and dock up, for whatever reason. 15 seconds after i stop shooting (in other words, 45 seconds before i'll be able to dock), my friend starts rring me. rather than having to wait a full 60 seconds to dock, he has to wait as long as i do- 45 seconds. presuming he continues to rr me until i have 15 seconds to dock, his timer continues to mimic mine, and so as soon as i can dock, so can he.a blob of rr domis will always be overpowered- just like a blob of falcons, or a blob of anything. at some point, fights do become a numbers game- whether everyone involved in the fight is in one of the 2 warring corps, friends of the corps, or hired to help.of all the elements of a fight, rr is by far the easiest to counter. it's extremely short range, it takes a lot of capacitor, and presuming that you argue that logistics ships are op, logistics at range are extremely vulnerable to sensor damps, logistics up close are extremely vulnerable to neuts, or just dps.the current mechanic is flawed- but most of your supporters are just whining along with you. quit acting like it's the end of the world- i regularly fight people who have rr when i have none, and rather than spending my time complaining to ccp about it, i find ways to counter it myself. (note for those who are bound to respond ""lol tort you have liek 8 rr alts noob"": i have 2 alt accounts, each with several characters on them, sometimes used for rr. both of those 2 alts are currently unsubscribed and have been for the past 2 months.)"
5/4/2010,"awnser: no they should incur there own 60 second timer (witch will constantly resey while they are activly repping you)faclon v domi: this particular comparison you make is out of context, the reason being: that fleet of falcons will be assploded by concord if the join a fight without first pulling agro (somehow) whereas the hospital-domi fleet can rep anything they want to without any reprocussions (under current mechanic)secondly a fleet of falcons will melt to a fleet of domis, who fits a sensor damp on a pvp ship (with exception to pvp setups boosted by bonuses), i have never fit one of these mods to activly use in a pvp battleship or cruser as they generaly detract from my tank or tackle,the logi as a ship is op although used in boath pvp and pve aspects of the game, it is also abused by players/corps and alliances alike. i for 1 detest this kind of gameplay as it has a tendancy to take the element of danger away from a fight for the recipiant, i am always happy to recive help from my corp/aliance friends, but that is where my tollerance for this mechanic endsagain i 100% support the ops argument sorry me spelling most probably sux"
5/4/2010,"i think people keep saying they support neut rr because they counter it with more neutral rr.... that's hardly a fix. if someone can positively affect one side of a fight they have no right being a part of, someone else should logically be allowed to negatively affect the other side, without concord interference.the other example is: just kill the rr.i enjoy small gang warfare, and while neutral rr doesn't phase a fleet of 20+ because they can annihilate the threat, it is a massive game changer for the general small-gang hisec wardecs. any counter-argument that says: ""well maybe you should get more people and just blob"" or ""maybe you shouldn't be wardeccing and be a carebear"" is ignorant and overlooking the vast majority of wars in hisec. it is currently impossible to fight outside of any trade hub with less than a full squad against similar numbers without the fight being severely stacked against one side of the other within seconds of the fight starting, resulting in one side being annihilated and the other losing everything to a force that turned out to be 2 to 5 times their size. and sometimes it isn't planned out that way, but bored guys camping their targets who were looking to pull aggro in spidertank-fits involve themselves where they shouldn't be.tl;drpeeps want wars to only exist between massive corps that have 2 to 4 neutral rr's on alt accounts that are invincible until they decide to get involved."

5/4/2010,"i do agree that changing the skill to something more relevant would be nice. i would, however, like something more useful. a bonus to optimal range would do. mwd speed? how is that useful? if i have target far away, i use sentries, if i have target close i use heavies. in either cases drone mwd speed does not matter, i would like something more productive, like optimal, tracking, damage (not gonna happen, ishtar has quite a lot already), tank."

5/4/2010,"i figure there's about an 80% chance of troll, but you haven't annoyed me lately, so i'll give you a serious answer. regarding the details of your proposal, i have to say that your sense of game design sucks. 200% damage bonus, plus a -75% rof, is effectively 12x base damage. that frigate would do roughly abaddon dps. i'm sure i don't need to elaborate on why this is a bad idea. regarding the basic idea behind your proposal, while the idea of a ship that melds all the t2 skills together does amuse me, it strikes me as poor design. it would be nothing more than a tool for the old, high-skill players who can already use every other tool as it stands. now, speaking as one of those players, this might replace the daredevil on the ""actually makes me want to fly a frigate"" list. but it wouldn't be good for the game. stuff like this should be faction ships, to make them accessible to newer players. so yeah, not supported."

5/4/2010,"making bpos look different from bpcs has been proposed all over the place. but i can't find a specific thread in here for the current csm term.i'm going to go one step further make a slightly more specific proposal:make bpc icons different from bpo icons by creating a watermark on the icon indicating the number of runs remaining on the bpc.i know ccp has given some reasons why making any graphical distinction would hurt database performance. but i am proposing a completely client-side display change. this is similar to graying out locked items in a station container.just have some overlays for two digits, 0-9 each and an overlay for a 'greater than' sign. 21 overlays total. apply the appropriate overlays to fade the portions of the bp icon appropriate to the number of runs remaining. if there are more than 99 runs left, it displays "">99"".all computed and done client-side."
5/4/2010,alright while i would like this. ccp has already said this will never happen.your proposal doesn't help because the database information already has to be queried to build that watermark for the client to know what to do. it is a unique approach to the idea but doesn't help with the database load.
5/4/2010,"ok, so i understand that right now the database just returns the item as a blueprint, and doesn't say if it's a bpc or bpo.but seriously, how hard is it to change the database to have different item ids for bpcs and bpos? and that's not an ignorant, rhetorical question - i used to manage sql databases professionally. it's not that hard. and you can return the number of runs on the bpc in the stack size variable. heck, since bpcs are inherently unstackable, you can store the number of runs in the stack size variable."
5/4/2010,"1) how many bpo/bpc in your hangar? mine get sluggish opening now, i wouldn't like ti to have the speed of the old bookmark containers. 2) ""adding a extra column in the database is easy."" sure, but checking that it will not break some thousand different processes that use the database is hard."
5/4/2010,"i'm not a db professional, and this is gleaned from bits and pieces, but here's my understanding of how it works. for every item in game, there exists a single typeid for the appropriate blueprint. an item cannot have two different blueprints, just one(i expect this is because reprocessing is based on running the item backwards through the blueprint, so the process would screw up badly if multiple prints existed). as such, bpcs and bpos must have the same typeid, and data like ""is this a copy?"" and ""what's the me?"" are stored as attributes. because of optimizations to help reduce database lag, attributes of an item are not read unless they are specifically asked for, and there's no good way to ask for a specific set of attributes like ""is it a copy?"" without forcing the client to query all attributes of every item in your hangar, which would cause completely unacceptable lag. in other words, you can't break them apart by typeid, and you can't break them apart by attributes. there's no good ways to distinguish them. the science and industry window's blueprints tab can do a detailed info search on all of them because it isn't loaded often, but it's not something they're willing to do on the inventory screen. also, you misunderstand how items are stored with regards to stack sizes. an item is either packed, where it has simply a typeid and a stack size, or unpacked, where it has all those other fun attributes(contents, modules, insurance, names, me...). there is no ""stack size"" variable for a bpc, because a bpc is an unpacked item. the only way to get a stack size variable is to have a stack of packaged bpos off the market. so no dice storing the runs count there.edit: given that there's a 90% chance that your next post will be a variation of ""that's idiotic"", i'll preempt you. i think that you, i, and most of the staff of ccp would agree that it is. however, legacy code being what it is(in ccp's case, mostly undocumented basement code), it's unlikely to change, no matter how idiotic it may be. just look at poses."
5/4/2010,"afaik you are correct.items are either singleton ( unpackaged ) or non-singleton ( packaged ).bpc's are always singleton as you cant have a packaged bpc.singletons are always of stacksize 0 or is it 1 ? i'm not sure , but its always the same.so that field is free to be used for bpc runs.storing bpc runs in stacksize would be feasible , how many bugs would need to be picked out after implementation is anyones guess.as bpc/bpo differentiation is pretty much the biggest bugbear of most industrialists it would be worth investigating as a solution if nothing else.another possibe solution would be to use the high bit of the item typeid to indicate bpc.when jobs get installed for production all thats needed is to mask out the high bit."
5/4/2010,"actually the way it probably works is this:each item in the game has a typeid that identifies the type of item. each item also has an individual item id (call it individ) that identifies the individual item. it tells the difference between the 2732 scourge missiles in your cargo hold and the 102,753 scourges in your hangarwhen you look in a container (ship cargo, hangar, gsc, what have you), the game goes to the database and fetches everything within that container. how this is done depends on how containers are implemented.what gets returned is the contents of that container. each item has the individ for that particular item, it's typeid, a stack size, and an indicator of if the item is unpacked or not (i'd implement this as stack size -1 for assembled items, but it could be done another way).the client then displays an icon based on the typeid. the problem is that the bpcs and bpos have the same typeid, so the client can't distinguish between the two. so to find out which it is, the client would have to query the db to get the item details on that particular individ.the only way to fix this is to give bpcs and bpos different typeids. which, yes, is a pain in the butt. and the size of the item tables combined with the limited amount of available downtime poses an additional challenge. plus, the client would need to be updated with to recognize the new ids and use the new icons.given the client changes, this could only be done as part of a patch release. but the database script to split the ids on the table isn't that hard.putting the number of runs on the icon would require storing it in the stack size, which, to be honest, is almost certainly more trouble to implement than it's worth. but i still think it's a cool idea."
5/4/2010,"lag. it's a problem. everyone knows it. it's no secret that if a server is bogged down with a large amount of people, jumping into that system is inherently risky due to the client sometimes being unable to load the system before their ship is loaded to the system.simply put, in stressed situations. a server will load a player's ship into a system, but it might be minutes before the client has loaded the system. thus making that player extremely vulnerable to attack.the proposal is as follows: ccp should create a system that will protect players jumping through a gate/cyno bridge if their client is frozen in lag. (for jumping through only, eliminating lag in ordinary fleet battles is not the concern here)one method that i have heard before is increasing the cloak timer on ships. it is a good one, but only a temporary fix, since ships will decloak, and in a fleet battle on a gate...it is likely you will be decloaked if it is big enough.the other method that i suggested was a 'jump limbo'in which ships do not go directly from system a to system b, but instead go from system a to system c (a barren uninteractible 'load point' from which a client can load the server on system b) before being dumped in system b. with the advantage that they can actually fight back.more on that discussion in this thread. link"
5/4/2010,agreed!
5/4/2010,"oh tripple-supported. how about using the same notification popup like with new mail, skill completed etc? and while you're at it also add contracts to it. those are terribly hard to spot too."
5/4/2010,"this is my first post with a suggestion in 5 years of playing eve so bear with me here. it's 2:00am as well so i might need some help building on this idea.my main gripe is with local chat providing too much intel. everyone says ccp won't dumb down local until there is a fix for gathering intel (directional scanner). what i am a proposing below would probably be viewed as a partial fix but it might be one that would work good enough to allow local to be dumbed down sooner rather than... never.i propose the creation of a new module, the name of which is not important. it's function however, would be (when activated) to allow a ship's pilot to perform directional scans. there should be two versions, the standard directional scanner and the covert directional scanner. the standard variety would have a set max range like 10au (exact range is not important now) and the module can not be used while in warp. it should also use the ship's capacitor while activated. the second version, a covert variety would have an increasing max range (with astrometics skill level), can only be fit to ships which can fit covert ops cloaks, can be used while in warp, and does not use the ship's capacitor. the covert variety would function much like the current directional scanner but maybe allow it to reach to 25au (again, exact range is not important now) with astrometics v (fixes the nerf on that skill training).this would increase the importance of scouts and decrease the number of idiots flying around a system spamming the d-scanner every 10 seconds or whatever the limit is on it now. it would also allow the delayed local change for 0.0 space (and low sec) because (again) it will reduce the number of idiots who can spam the d-scanner. i'd also like to see standings icons and the red/green light buddy icon indicator removed from high sec locals but lets not ask for too much all at once. local chat, in all varieties of space, just gives away too much intel. possibly going with a straight text list as mentioned in other proposal threads of the past.if this has already been proposed, my apologies. as i said, it's after 2:00am now and i didn't search too deep."
5/4/2010,"oh yea, i support my own idea and good night!"
5/4/2010,"so you want to remove the directional scanner from ships, unless they fit a module for the purpose? local or no local, this is a bad idea."
5/4/2010,"and what slot would this module go in?high: gimp all ships that have a full set of hardpoints.med: gimp shield tankers, low med slot ships, have to drop tackle for it.low: gimp armour tanks, damage, nano.so no, bad idea. directional scanner has been needed enough thanks."
5/4/2010,"regardless of whether this item would require a slot or not, it's still a bad idea. the lag it would generate due to constant queries to the database would slow down the servers drastically.i'm sure you've heard and/or experienced the lag from fleet fights, since the computer has to render the location, texture maps, and activities from all nearby ships. now the server would have to pipe the information on ships (and quite possibly their locations) to each ship with one of these devices fitted to it?on top of this, you're gonna remove any visual indication of status of the enemy (at war, horrible standings, etc)? this is gonna lead to a cluster**** in low and null security space, and whining will be immense from surprise ganks.i'm sorry, but local is a much less cpu-intensive solution to intel, at least for now. all the computer has to do is query the pilot and standings relations for local whenever a status change occurs (most likely by activation of a stargate or other form of travel).i'm sorry, but this idea will not work, even if it was built in to all ships. not supported."
5/4/2010,"nah bunyip i am not sure, but i think he means that you need to fit a module, and only then you can spam the dir scanner button. so that would indeed decrease lag.however lets follow his logic:1. lets remove local2. oh wait, then you force everyone to smash the dir scanner button every 10 seconds3. solution: lets remove the directional scanner then you dont have to smash the button every 10 secondswhile he completely skips the actual problem, and calls everyone who is trying to stay alive by smashing the dir scanner instead of waiting nicely until they get ganked idiots."
5/4/2010,"please elaborate why you think it would be a bad idea. not just a bad idea because it inconveniences you, but the whole of eve.yes, it would most likely be a high slot module, just like that of the cloaking device. would you like the cloaking device removed from game since it gimps ships with hardpoints as well? those that feel that they can not survive without a d-scanner are free to fit one to their ship. i'm not saying you can't d-scan at all anymore.maybe you didn't read my post correctly. what i am suggesting will in no way increase load onto the server side, it will in fact decrease it by allowing a smaller percentage to ships to use the d-scanner.how did i skip the actual problem? sure it may not be the best solution, but it's better than the current situation. i've actually allowed for the repair of two problems at once. both sides, cat & mouse, lose the ability to d-scan. if you're gang doesn't have a scout, you're probably looking to get ganked anyway. why does everyone in gang need a d-scanner? what purpose does it serve when local goes up by one and 50 people in gang all start hitting the scan button? it serves as increased load on the server, i fixed it."
5/4/2010,"no, it would increase the number of noob-alts sitting in system spamming scan.and if people don't have the security provided by the current d-scan, especially without local, they're just plain not going to go to lowsec or 0.0 because the risk and tedium aren't worth it. and then cue bleating about ""why don't i have any targets? nerf highsec!"", i suppose."
5/4/2010,"can't say that i like this idea, especially for ships like mining barges/exhumers. a retriever/skiff would be totally blind to anyone else out there or unable to do their mining job if they had to fit a d-scan module."
5/4/2010,"what i was hoping for was a ""proximity altert"" d-scan upgrade module - such that if something came within 10au of you it appeared either on your overview or in a notification of some variety (maybe just auto appeared on d-scan). anyway. i can't reasonably support this.-liang"
5/4/2010,"proposal:add a character's current manufacturing and science/ research jobs to their respective menus. description:show what the total jobs your character has active in the science and industry menu, and the manufacturing menu.your client would need to query the server to get this information, and queries may need to be restricted to lessen server load (such as how your items don't update for 10mins etc).how it works now:as the total amount of active jobs isn't show you have to refresh your active job list and then manually count your active jobs or alternatively you keep putting jobs on until you get a message that says you've reached your job limit.pros:less clicks and micro managing.cons:although this proposal would require small server queries it could escalate with all the industry and science loons out there - which may cause moar.. lag.example image:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.vote t'amber for csm fiveall your vote are belong to me-t'amber"
5/4/2010,"would be quite handy, yes."
5/4/2010,"i fly a redeemer occasionally and yeah, a rifter probably is better. as said, they need bs performance in addition to their role bonuses. and by role bonuses i mean the jump drive and ability to fit a covert jump portal generator. the sin's agility bonus and all of their cloaked speed bonus should really go. even the redeemer's tracking speed bonus is questionable at best.so buff ehp, buff jump range and take a look into some of the bonuses attached to the bo's skill. i'd like to see the current bo's skill bonuses replaced with some sort of ew but that's just me. but a covert ops cloak is not needed. if all it got was a cov ops cloak, they'd still be terrible."
5/4/2010,"anything bo's could use is a hp buff, nothing more...learn to use them."
5/4/2010,not supported unless suicide ganking takes another nerf. u can instantly buy all the isk u want via plex but u can't instantly buy back sec status--u have to grind it and that helps keep suicide ganking in check.
5/4/2010,"thats a pretty dire suggested change. it's basically regressing eve back to the old ""need bookmarks to visit a region"" state. bookmark a spot 90km behind the gate and warp to it at 100 neatly circumvents your proposal.i know people bemoan the fact that eve was bigger back in the day but wtz is great (im lazy).landing some arbitary distance off a gate sounds like an invitation for gangs to sit there with 3 sebos trying to pop crap before it can approach. i don't think i need to write too much more since the chances of this happening are about on par with me getting a threesome with the current hollywood a list."
5/4/2010,"i thought people were being over zealous within this thread, but then i got pointed in the direction of this thread from some time ago, and it opened my eyes to your attitude to eve and pvp. carry on guys and gals, ank needs stopping for sure."
5/4/2010,girl powahhh! you totaly have my vote pleae don't listen to the trolls and work for a player pirate free high-sec (compiuter pirates are okay tho )your idea about reducing player skills by 20% for any pirat actions are perfect for removing the grievers from this game. maybe just make it 1 skill randomly chosen so the trolls have nothing more to complain!
5/4/2010,obvious troll is obvious..it's become awfully quiet in here. i still don't have answers to my questions which makes me think to move my votes to someone else who's participating in these elections more actively.
5/4/2010,"seconding this. i had picked up only a vaguely negative view of ankh due to threads like this one, but that linked thread makes everything so clear...best quote so far is this:says it all really."
5/4/2010,this. not 1 or 2 replies that confirm our concerns about your no-pvp eve online but 11 pages of your deluded idea about how the game should be changed to suit your selfish desires. you scream consequences in that thread i say this thread is consequence enough for you.
5/4/2010,"some of ankhe's opinions: and some really juicy ones! (yes, fair representation. even though we're parasitic scum.) all of these quotes can be found in this thread, if anyone doubts they are valid. i just thought i'd post them to save everyone else the trouble."

5/4/2010,"you do not get off the hook when suicide ganking someone, they get kill rights on you, and on the one occasion it happened to me(i didnt lose anything valuable :v ) i got my own back on the ganker.maybe this is the wrong csm you are trying to get in for, hello kitty online is always open to you. ccp's own words are that they mean it be a harsh, dark place, where you are supposed to feel slightly angry when you log in, and are never truelly safe. ccp want it to be a dangerous game, and a lot of other people do to, you will not change anything."

5/4/2010,"the csm campaigns are really heating up and there are some great candidates this election. tough for someone to stand out in a crowd like this.so again i'd like to make the case for the pilots of eve to consider supporting me as their csm candidate.1. i am mature and take this seriously. that means i show up and will for my complete term! i understand every idea has a benefit and a cost. i have 30 plus years experience in software engineering and years of actual experience in the games industry. i also have no interest in gaining some personal advantage in eve. i'll never be part of a scandal or breach of trust with ccp.2. i am not part of a ""special interest"" like a large powerblock alliance or one of the many ""celebrities"" runnning against me. i really am ""just another player"" here in eve in terms of my focus and interests.3. i recognize eve is inherently a pvp game and will always support the right for another pilot to try and shoot someone in the face in space. i will want the ""face shooting"" to be made interesting, challenging and potentially rewarding for the target if they can avoid the ""face shooting"" thing as they slip about in space.4. i also believe the the ecconomy of eve is key to its appeal. that it is truly a player driven economy so eve has to remain interesting to industrialst and traders. i minored in business and understand economics in rl.5. i'm accessable and love to hear from other players in eve. if you have an idea i'll pay attention when you share it and i will take the time to think about it. i believe that while the individual csm should bring their own experiences and views to share with ccp they are ultimately the representatives of the greater pilot base of eve. great ideas can come from almost anywhere so i am open to hear what folks think about how to make eve even better.6. i think i understand the idea of stakeholder with ccp better than most of the other candidates as a result of my direct experieces professionally in agile software engineering process. this is the professional world i live in and i think i can bring a lot to the table when representing the pilots of eve to ccp.7. eve has to stay fun! i am all about having fun in eve. ask anyone that has been in my corp or alliance. the randomness of space would have to create some humor once in a while. with eve being such a rich and complex experience with a challenging learning curve we need to remember that you have to have someting enjoyable about your life in the 'verse to make you want to keep logging in. eve walks a very fine line between huge fun and a grind at times.so please feel free to bring up any points you'd like my views on. thanks for taking the time to read this and please remember to vote!issler dainzeyour next csm representative!"

5/4/2010,"how about making them easier to find instead of increasing their duration? in k-space it's not that big an issue since you'll generally have 1-2 signatures per systems (if that), but an unfarmed wormhole can have dozens of signatures which makes finding paths through w-space more effort than it's worth most of the time."
5/4/2010,"that is pretty cool; make it so dedicated cov-ops frigs can get the ability to filter out non-wormhole signatures. as it is right now, if i'm looking for people in wormholes i get way more benefit bringing a probing arazu than i do a helios, so this also gives cov-ops frigs a more defined role. i think it has some promise. maybe if it becomes way too easy to pin down wormholers, have these ships eliminate two types of signatures so if you're looking for wormholes you can still find some radar and magneto sites but you get to bypass the numerous gravimetric and ladar. there's something good in here, i'll do some research as to what wormholer dwellers think about this."

5/4/2010,"good question, but you answered it yourself. i think that with the new insurance system, we will finally reach the same mineral/product price, which we would, if all insurance was removed overnight. so, from the industrialist point of view, it doesn't matter, exists there insurance system in the game or not. market shall stabilize itself and maybe miners will start mining various ores, not just veld in highsec and arkonor in nullsec. also, after yesterday's ""the initiative."" alliance's bombing run(if you don't know what i'm talking about, check caod/their killboard/scrapheap forums), i was asked, what do i think about current status of bombers. i think, this is very reasonable question and i will answer it here.my position on bombers is simple: they are fine. to achieve good results in a bomber, you need lots of practise and player skill. most of the players fail to understand this, but if you would try, you would find out, that bombers in the hands of unskilled players deliver only ""lulz"", not the bombs. there is only one alliance i know about, which mastered the use of bombers - goonswarm. all others try to repeat the same success with various degrees of failure. you should also remember, that presence of bombers removes easy mode for the fleets. fleet members nowadays need to be constantly aware of possibility of bombing run and spread themselves out. it also brings new tactics and various improvisation to counter enemy bomber squads. so, i think, it's only for the best. i understand, that some of you, fellow eve players, would want to be able to fly in semi-afk mode and just shoot, when you are told. but i disagree. such ""combat"" is bad for the game and just allows for the f1-monkeys to think themselves elite-pvpers. so, i disagree with statement, that bombers should be nerfed. they are fine, just stop being lazy and learn to counter them."
5/4/2010,"whats to stop alliances putting hundreds or thousands of smartmines blocking their main entry systems? so they would have to be limited and priced accordingly to how much dps they could do.im not a fan of this as it means you dont need to defend your own space. its no longer pvp its pve.the tournament training idea is good and could be taken further to allow true 1v1 up to say 5v5 fights where both sides have to agree to allow only certain number and types of ships into the arena and thus you know there will be a fight without other ships interfering. these arenas are essentially considered 0.0 but could be in hisec and lowsec.i dont agree with allowing system targetting as it overly complicates things and would likely increase lag further to allow for these calculations.the suicide attacks in empire can be most often avoided by flying the right type of ship, depending on what youre carrying. i dont really see a need to change it. the golem is allready the best ship in its class, why would you give it a better bonus than the other other faction ships?i do like the escort (mini) carrier idea though."
5/4/2010,"short answer to both of these questions - i'm not claiming to have all the answers but if voted back into csm i will continue to support proposals relating to these issues. the most important point is i have relevant experience in both of these areas.however i do have a few specifics for those wondering about my position on things.sov for smaller alliancesactually taking sov without help is most likely out of the question at the moment and i'm not sure it should be. the issue is that if a group of 50 active players could take sov then 500 players will be able to take sov with no trouble at all - and that is ignoring any people trying to defend. i'm willing to look at ideas around this but for now it isn't realistic for smaller entities to take and hold sov without initial help from other alliances. if the promised formalised treaty system was in place this could open the playing field a bit.lowsecthe first major issue here is to define what lowsec actually is (other than 0.1 to 0.4 space ). in lowsec you of course have pvp and pirates but you also have factional warfare (split between pvp, mission running and plexing), industrial pos (moon mining, reactions, drugs), agents (all missions up to and including l5s), logistic bases (carrier jumping assets to 0.0) and so on. the pvp is a bit different in lowsec to 0.0 but that is down to removal of bubbles and bombs (and currently doomsdays) and the addition of the global criminal flag.ccp seem to treat lowsec just as a stepping stone to 0.0. however i understand that for some people 0.0 sov war is not the eve endgame!so which of the areas of lowsec needs to be improved?lowsec needs different things added to it to give the various inhabitants reason to stay. in addition there needs to be a clear divide between lowsec and 0.0. this means adding things to lowsec not available in 0.0 (the reverse is already true). lets have a look at specific areas.pirates: we hear a lot of people talk of consequences for your actions, but when players choose to become pirates they don't really gain anything . i believe that as highsec is closed off to a -5 and below pirate that something should open up in return. i have mooted the idea of pirate only stargates which would link different systems than the usual gates. this would give pirates a mobility advantage when stalking their prey or when being chased. it would also open a potential flashpoint in systems for anti-pirates to lurk. the idea isn't fully formed as yet but i have been discussing it with pirates to get feedback. for anyone wondering, my sec status is +5 and so this wouldn't actively benefit me industry: i'm not sure what to suggest here, much depends on how planetary interaction turns out. any improvements to pos mechanics would be a welcome boost but that isn't unique to lowsec. if players have good ideas for this i will give them serious consideration.factional warfare: i have run fw missions but unlike other candidates i have also participated in the ad-hoc fleet fights and had fun shooting other players . fw has the potential to be so much more than the current system allows, it should be the best place to pick up a quick fleet and go pvp till your ship explodes. unique navy items were a nice boost for the mission runners but the pvp side seems to lack rewards and many of the fw mission runners are not willing to pvp. more dynamic missions or missions that put opposite faction players in direct competition could be interesting.hopefully that gives some answers though of course it does open questions too tl:drif elected to csm5 i will support proposals to improve lowsec"
5/4/2010,"the problem is the steamroller mechanics of sov warfare. if you have enough momentum, you will plow through an entire region and there is nothing a small alliance can do to defend.so the issue is, something radical is needed. pi+dust is supposed to influence system sovereignty, but how will being able to defend a few planetary installations stop a giant cap-blob from denying you access to the planets anyway? seems like an issue.personally i think, if you want to hold space, you actually have to be there to keep sovereignty up. it should be more than just planting a flag.on the other hand, if people are supposed to live in more confined areas, in order to make room for more diverse alliances, there has to be more stuff to do than just grinding one sanctum after another in your thanatos, cause i'd imagine that gets rather boring in the long run."
5/4/2010,"vuk lau was elected to the 2nd and 3rd csm (serving as chairman initially). after reaching the two-term limit elvenlord then took up a similar agenda in vuk's place for the 4th csm, also serving as chairman.for this next 5th csm session the two term limit has been abolished because it's clear that there aren't enough serious candidates actually prepared to work hard through an entire csm session (or in some cases just bother showing up to the weekly meetings) and that blocking people like vuk from standing again, and limiting elven to only one more term wasn't in the players' interests. since we both enjoyed our time on the council and found it productive, being genuinely surprised how receptive ccp are to the csm's ideas, we will both be standing this time.the 5th csm will sit for a full 10 months and for the first time will have a 'stakeholder' status when it comes to eve development, allowing the council to prioritize specific features/fixes from the backlog each expansion. this makes this session by far the most important yet. it's therefore essential that the players get represented by delegates who are serious about the task, and will have the stamina to work hard at it through the whole session.in the past we have both gotten more than twice the votes needed to get elected so it should be possible to elect us together but we need you the voter to help make this happen. we will be pursuing very similar policies but will together be able to raise twice as many issues and work twice as hard at harassing ccp to fix stuff. so we are kindly asking that if you had planned to vote for either vuk or elven you help us both get elected by tactically voting as follows:- if the main character on the account you're voting with has a name begining with a to k you vote vuk lau- if the main character on the account you're voting with has a name begining with l to z you vote elvenlordthank you for you votes, and we hope you're proud of the tough but constructive line we've taken with ccp so far on your behalf,- vuk lau & elvenlord"
5/4/2010,"our simple plan ...we understand eve primarily as a pvp game, where pve's role is to provide a modicum of stability and certainty, to contrast with the apparent chaos of player-driven competition that could otherwise seem overwhelming to new players.our definition of pvp doesn't limit itself to stuff that goes ka-boomey in the dark, however, and we fully appreciate and partake in the industrial, economical, political and other less-obvious forms of competition that make eve such a rich universe.in our view, 0.0 and the player-conquerable side of new eden are the 'end game' of eve, the place where players get the most opportunities to make a difference in the grand scheme of things and write history, yet we certainly don't discount the critical importance of the empire experience.both as training grounds for future nullsec dwellers, and as the heart of a different, and equally important pvp ecosystem, empire is where new players and future alliances can sharpen their teeth, where business tycoons and war profiteers can quietly scheme, play markets and influence distant conflicts, and where those who found themselves on the losing end of a territorial contest can recover, heal, and prepare for revenge.one of the oft-overlooked cornerstones of eve (especially by pvpers) is industry, but not by us. we know ships must finish building before they can go boom in space, miners would have nobody to sell to, and traders would have no wares to peddle without industrialists. industry and logistics are the glue that holds together roid-lickers, mission runners, killboard *****s and fleet admirals, thus players who tackle those thankless, behind-the-scene roles in eve should be heard and represented, for nothing much would ever happen without their efforts.during the course of past csm sessions we've found ourselves working on every kind of issue and aspect of the game imaginable and this will be the case again. however the particular issues we will continue to fight especially hard on are:- fixing of broken, unfinished, or legacy features in preference to continually adding new features. this includes for example: server performance in fleet fights, the roles system, factional warfare, some ship balancing, and so on.- the poor state of eve's customer support. this is obviously a tough issue for ccp to tackle (or to even acknowledge sometimes) since they cannot just assign some coder time to fixing it. instead it cuts to the heart of the management of their company and the culture that's grown up within the gm department over years. however with the csm's growing influence we're confident some more meaningful progress can be made eventually. in the meantime we don't intend to let the issue drop."
5/4/2010,"why vote for us, besides the unrealistic hope of ever owning a veldspar-grazing equid ?because we care about eve as much as you do, if not more; because we have a vast personal experience of most aspects of the game, on both sides of the lowsec border (and on the border, too); because our perspective on what's good for eve extends beyond what helps us and our best buddies wtfpwn by next expansion; and more importantly, because we want to keep playing eve and enjoy it in the future, and a prime condition for that to happen is for the game and the map to get as deep, rich, wide and diverse as possible. your game matters to us, because it's what makes eve worth playing. if you joined yesterday and have nfc where you want to go from here, we want you to get the opportunity to explore as much as possible, as soon as possible, so you can figure it out; if you're a n00b, we look forward to meet you as a future partner or competitor, and it's in our best interest you get every chance to grow into a formidable opponent, a friendly neighbor, or a mysterious stranger; if you're a mission-runner, we'll help make your life more interesting, until the wormhole drones get tough enough to make you realize you could be ready for another kind of epic arcs; if you're a combat pilot, regardless of friend or foe, we want you to log in and have fun going boom in the dark: no fighters, no wars  no wars, no joy; if you're a logistician, ceo or director, we want you to finally have the tools that will allow you to share your workload with corp and alliance mates, to stop burning out every 6 months and to get to fly a ship with high-slots, once in a while; if you're an fc, we want you to not be alone anymore, herding cats or drumming in the void at 6am for the third night in a row  we'll help you have a talk with the n00b and combat pilot above; if you're a small alliance with dreams of frontier life, we want you to have a fighting chance against a mindless blob, and to make a home for yourself in 0.0 more by talent and dedication than numbers; if you're sitting in a boring alliance in 0.0, we want for you the possibility to go have fun in empire until you find a better one, instead of ragequitting; if you're dabbling in factional warfare, we want it to teach you skills that will make you a force to be reckoned with once you cross over to nullsec; if you're an industrialist, we want for you the power to differentiate yourself from your neighbor, be it by branding your products, researching better bpcs, or running a co-op without getting arse****d; if you're a miner, we are going to look hard for people who have ideas about making your game more fun; if you're a trader, we hate you, yet we need you, but that's how you like it, right? if you're a two-bits scammer, we have a bridge to sell you in jitavote for us !for more info you can visit our website"

5/4/2010,"many platforms and ideas by other candidates but lets start with the most important thing:my priority: fix the lag!guys/gals, i have just read some csm ' vote for me ' messages.i know that we have a considerable number of people running for csm -5 this year, and that the choices are going to be difficult to say the least.i am not going to politically bash anyone in order to gain more votes for myself.but we do need to decide in which order of these candidates we should vote for.i believe that i am at least one of the men for the job for a variety of reasons above the rest.i was in csm-2 first as an alternate then became a full csm-2 member.the last 2 csm elections both csm-3 and in csm-4 i participated in. due to an error on the side of ccp for csm-3 and lack of just a few short votes in making alternate for csm-4since csm-2, csm-3 and csm-4 i have spent a lot of my free time with past and present csm members on a daily basis through facebook.this allows me considerable contact with csm, and 'others' on current issues and upcoming issues and expansions.i also make regular trips to iceland for reasons other than eve related business.this not an attempt to get a 'free ride' as i can do it myself at anytime and do it frequently as i have friends and family in iceland.i was at fanfest 2008 and 2009 and participated in conferences and discussions that are eve related rather than wasting time and making a fool of myself.i have played this game for the last 7 years and the majority of my corp has played for more than 5 years i also desire to form a coalition of competent people to help players to see some of the things we enjoy most in this game to be fixed or improved or even added.this coalition would be players that have a good grasp at the needs of this game to be made better for all players. not just some cosmetic work but real improvements such as the laagggggg!how about more server hardware, or other improvements, that can make this server more reliable for our game play?sure there are little things that need to be fixed here and there which could and should be addressed.and yes, even more love to the pirates because lord knows we like to shoot them but seriously dont they need a few more perks?let them use the bubble in .3 on down and thier bombs. isn't it supposed to be 'low sec' for a reason? besides too many regions of space connecting empire to 0.0 where this should be allowed.but i do think that the insurance for these so called ""suicide gankers"" should be null and void, or at the very minimum that platinum insurance should pay out less than 50%sure it should be allowed that's not the problem but you ever had to pay lower premiums or deductibles when you have been found at fault in the accident?there are many small, medium, and large fixes to the game and so many pros and cons to all of them, to list them all here and argue their points.i know that the majority of you would rather avoid a wall of text to read but ask your questions here and i will be happy to answer them.extreme ceo of eye of godthank you!"

5/4/2010,"some ideas are good, yes... but ecm? ecm already got destroyed by the nerf bat. the way it is now could even be considered slightly underpowered.i like everything else though.."
5/4/2010,for 0.0 i would like to see a more regionalized eve. conflicts need to scale down again. big conflicts with 10 and more alliances on each side should still be possible but not be the norm. smaller alliances need the ability to fight without getting drawn into big north/south ideological issues. rebalancing jumprange and jumpcost will help reduce the projected power of large alliances and force them to decide which conflict they want to interfere and not be able to move their capitalblob onto all smaller fights within 2 regions of their hq. changes to local with an revamp of the scanner would also help making eve a better place again.lowsec needs a boost as well. ideally i would like to see a dedicated industry branch that is only available in lowsec. implant production springs to mind here. as seen in wh-space people are not totally adverse to risk as long as they have enough reward and can have some fun getting the reward. the knowledge gained there should be used to make lowsec more attractive.
5/4/2010,^^^^ i very much support this notion.the current jump range takes all strategy out of warfare and turns it into the tactical slugfest it currently is.force projection capabilities are a key factor in strategic warefare. as it is now every major power block in eve can project a decisive force to nearly any point in the universe at nearly any given time.
5/4/2010,nerf might be the wrong word. biggest problem i have with ecm is the drones and that they are too powerful. another thing that needs looked at is the eccm as they are currently not in line with other counter measures.

5/4/2010,"as noted, my campaign is primarily to ""fix the little things first"" - however, some balance changes could be considered little changes as it wouldn't take much to implement the. after speaking with many players regarding what they'd like to see, precedence for the requirement of balance in these following areas is extant:rockets - improve their viability as a small weapon, number of potential solutions, but something needs to be doneassault frigates - make these actually more appealing than flying a t1 frigate. again, some varying solutions, but one i tend to prefer is giving them another bonus to keep in line with other t2 ships. huginn - split weapon bonuses, split ewar bonuses = bad for this shipdestroyers - currently they have a tough place in the hierarchy of ships. they could use some thought-juices.ferox - needs some slight improvement to bring it inline with other bcs, perhaps a tad more cpu/pgthe list could go on, but i feel overreaching only decreases your chances of getting anything accomplished at all. however, little feasible things is the way to go. many ideas previously backed by csm have been rejected on the simple basis that they were too large. if you value giving priority to little fixes like this, vote for cinori aluben. my priority is that ccp make these ""little things"" a priority. cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"

5/4/2010,"destroyers already raised by dierdra vaal in csm3 :pas the csm also goes over previous issues, i'm sure to bring up destroyers, afs and rockets (among others). balancing will always get some attention, and is an ongoing process, so the best thing we can do as csms is keep asking ccp for these changes."

5/4/2010,"most issues don't have 100% player agreement but...i'd like to see ecm counters get some more attention. it seems unbalanced that a well-tanked bs fitted with two t2 eccms can be practically perma-jammed by one falcon and yet i've seen it happen quite a few times. rather than buff one module (eccm) as many are calling for, changes that would force fitting trade-offs and increase unpredictability would make things more interesting on both sides of the battlefield.one idea along those lines to implement some skill + module combos that would passively affect specific jamming attributes of an enemy ship. the cost to fit would have to be significant to force reasonable trade-offs. on the other side of the fence, ecm modules might also be tweaked to have particular susceptibilities, forcing ecm to more carefully consider their own fits. i am no ecm expert by any stretch of the imagination. that's why ecm balancing is the topic of one of my upcoming focus groups. i want to hear what some ecm experts have to say on the matter, as well as others. focus group topic, details, and schedule will be published in separate posts hopefully this evening (est) after work (woulda been sooner, but a rather demanding software release this week is keeping me from focusing as much as i'd like on my internet spaceships agenda )."
5/4/2010,"as a ecm specialist (recons v, etc) i can tell you ecm is absolutely not overpowered. can a single falcon pilot seriously hinder (there's no such thing as perma jamming a eccm'd battleship, but if you're lucky you can get a few cycles in a row) a eccm battleship? yes. but it needs all of its jammers to accomplish this. if a recon pilot in an expensive but paperthin ship dedicates most of the mods on his ship (most jammers, signal distortion amps, ecm rigs - so no notable dps or tank) on a single target, i feel its not unreasonable to seriously incapacitate that ship. and of course you never hear about all those times people simply shot the poor falcon pilot because his jams failed.our paper jamming ships already lost their range bonus (), so we're now in range of just about everyone.sorry, didnt want to derail the thread but people who want to keep nerfing ecm even after the recent changes make me raaaaaaaaggggeeeee.to make this post slightly constructive - if you agree with me that ecm does not need to be nerfed, vote dv! \o/"
5/4/2010,"perfect, then all of my suggestions have precedent, as i mentioned, thanks for giving more force to the validity of my post. i will agree with you also that drone boats need a little bit of love, from the sense of drone control and drone ai, which would improve their effective dps, and micromanagability of their power. however, drones should not become fittable mini-ships, that's really pushing it. those are the kind of ideas that past csms have put out that are too overreaching, and ccp is going to whisk them to the side because they're impractical, unfeasible. this. and they should be able to use covops cloaks."
5/4/2010,dierdre--rage if you must but also consider participating in the focus group and sharing your views; i talk to plenty of folks that think ecm balance isn't quite there yet.
5/4/2010,"what about adding a script to eccm so you for example could switch your sensor type, imagine a tempest running around with amarr senosr. would have to be balanced so if you switch sensor type you would only end up with about half your orginal sensor strength."
5/4/2010,"black ops w/ covert cloaks, i'm ambivalent on this one, but since black ops main purpose in 0.0 warfare seems to be bridging in covert fleets rather than directly engaging the enemy, so i'd say keep it the way it is first.the bellicose - i'd really like to see the gun bonus swapped for a missile bonus and give it one more missile hardpoint to make it a minmatar missile cruiser - with target painting. minmatar have a missile frigate and battleship, so give them a cruiser too. assault frigates - doing their bit to say 'sometimes it's ok to fit an afterburner', i'd like to see a bit more work on the aborted changes that were introduced during the development of dominion. i love my harpy, but my hawk suffers from the rocket balance problems which are also eternally being worked on.ecm & ewar in general - we have a bunch of ewar sensor systems, anti sensor systems and they're all kind of their own domain. sensor boosters help you target faster or at longer ranges, but are also a counter to sensor dampeners, eccm makes your ships harder to jam, but also makes your harder to probe down. there's huge scope to rationalize all these mechanics into something a little more ordered and expand play options while we're at it.ccp should consider making t1 ammuntion types affect falloff as well as optimal range, because there's almost no point to fit anything other than the highest damage type in blasters or autocannons (pulse lasers have decent'ish optimal).also on the subject of ammo, i believe the game would benefit from some differentiation between faction ammo types that reflect races fighting style. for example hybrid charges are produced by the caldari and gallente, the ammo could reflect racial focus with the gallente version doing a coupleof percent points more in terms of damage, and the caldari version giving a bit more range and lower cap use but with a smaller damage bonus. and lets not forget noob ships - everybody flies these at some point. :)the ibis - seriously, it's a caldari ship that can't mount missiles, my first few ships were railgun platforms which meant i never really played with missiles until i was flying a rokh. so make it harder for other noobs to make this kind of mistakethe impairor - while i'm on the subject of noob ships, it's bonus is ridiculous, you can't fit enough lasers to make the laser cap bonus matter. switch it to a laser damage bonus for some fairness. the velator has almost too much damage, switch it to a 10% falloff range bonus for hybrids so it doesn't need to spend forever getting close."
5/4/2010,"yes. we. can. we can hope. we can dream. but when we wake up, the only csm candidate ready for the future is me. and the future is coming. it's coming and it's bringing with it massive changes to production, pvp, armored kodiak bears, attack blimps, and enough weaponized robots to turn hope into a four-letter word. you want hope? keep dreaming. you want change? put out your cup. you want freedom? vote for me as csm.some may say that my bid for csm is too late in the game. late to the race. late to the party. well i say the party doesn't get started until i arrive. and while the other candidates are serving special interests, i'm serving the good people of eve a steaming pile of change with a side order of suck it.when people ask about my position on gate camping, i have two words for them: attack dogs. no turrets, no concord, just dogs. attack dogs. it's time for people to learn that this freedom isn't free.vote for me if you want to live.plumpy mcpudding for csm. screw 'em all! the whistles go woo woo!"
5/4/2010,"from what i gather, the ideas that are brought up for the csm to push forward to ccp have to be voted on by the csm and ccp will only look at the ones that are unanimous.so what happens when someone like ankwhatever is on the csm, now i believe that she will get voted on as most people that will vote for her don't read the forums or actually agree with her idea of a personal single player game.say for example, when a proposal is raised to the csm that ultimately makes gameplay in hisec better, like the proposal of docking timers related to ship size but will affect a lot of players negatively, what happens if ank finds this affects her beloved mission runners, ie their loot pinatas when wardecced get creamed trying to dock, so she votes against it, does this matter and the proposal will go through on a majority or does it need to be unanimous of all csm members?what i'm getting at here is that someone with so polar opposite gameplay ideas to what the game actually is, especially with the new terms to csm members could actually make the csm obsolete, what course of actions are available to rectify this?"
5/4/2010,"the process is as follows.a proposal is raised in the assembly hall forum. it has to be in there for at least 7 days before the meeting for public review, comments and supports (even csm delegates have to abide by this rule)a full delegate (not alternate) then raises the proposal which puts it onto the next meeting agenda (adding it to the wiki)at the meeting the proposal is debated (if needed) and then put to a voteif a majority is reached then the proposal is added to the next iceland summit for discussion with ccpif a majority is not reached then the proposal is rejectedthus a single delegate cannot block anything, nor can they push something through without getting majority support (so any candidate unable to play well with others is going to find it tricky)."
5/4/2010,"thank you teadaze, apologies for the misconception that it had to be unanimous."
5/4/2010,"most of the issues i proposed during csm 1 and 2 were accepted unanimous by the csm though, the polar opposite ideas are a myth propegated by a few trolls and slanderers here on the forums."
5/4/2010,keep on spinnin' you honest politician you.
5/4/2010,"i'd imagine that pvp and 0.0sec issues will have a fair representation seeing as so many seats will probably go to the big alliances. alot of people play the way anhk does and they deserve a voice - whether it is through her or someone else, but i imagine the seats for that play style will be small.i'm sure i'll get bagged for say this, but atleast she puts alot of effort into her campaign. -t'amber"
5/4/2010,"we are the mice who have been handed the bell by the cat.any power the csm has is by the grace of ccp.*looks up and reads the above and shakes his head*but . . . i don't think they are just paying it lip service. i do think that we will have an effect on the game.look at the platforms and you can see those who have their own personal axes to grind. those who are trying to mouth the words and hope they get picked for the choir. and those who are willing to represent the population and make the game better. not just a corner of the game but the whole damn thing. but in the words of the old joke ""how does one eat an elephant? one bite at a time."" we have to say where we will start. but if you are looking for someone to kick in ccp's doors and start making demands at the top of their lungs . . . you are going to be wasting your vote. change does not come to the screamers . . . it comes to the people who can make a reasoned argument combined wiht a suggestion for how things could be better.m"
5/4/2010,"so many agree with the points above (and glad to see it as someone wise proposed the business model a few posts up! )yet, even with so many existing csm candidates trying to return to their existing seats . . . . so few actually showing a history of doing these things (no names mentioned).vote them all out! even if you don't vote for me.time for a change!"
5/5/2010,"same reply as every other black ops thread...do not make them any better at offense or defense.do give them more range for jump and/or better fuel usage for jumping the gang.do give them covert ops cloak.do make them cheaper(less mats for build)it is a fragile special use ship. it is designed to get groups where they could not usually travel, and do it covertly. the whole 'covert' concept goes out the window when a black ops has to warp anywhere at present.if black ops are given better resists and/or dps they will become pvp ships, which we have plenty of already. not every ship in the game needs to be a damage dealer."
5/5/2010,"hey,i'm comming back to the game after a long break, so i might be a bit rusty, but i'd like to add my 2 cents to the argument. the problem is in the ships. you can have an awesome armor repair amount or tracking, but in the end of the day you only have one bonus to damage, you move with the speed and grace of a brick in a bucket of tar and have minimal effective range. gallente ships (partialy because of blasters, but mostly because of the ships' design) are easy to exploit, when going into fight with minmatar and amarr ships you know you're going in with a handicap, they'll do damage sooner and you won't be able to balance that cause you don't do much more damage overall, if they can pull range on you, you'll die without chances to win, going against caldari blaster boats is kicking yourself in the balls, because they have your dps and alot better tank. ofcourse all of this applies to caldari too, but they're alot more effective with null in scrambler range, also they have easier time fitting ion guns due to low pg requirement on shield tank.i'd simply reduce the mass of gallente and caldari blaster boats, because i can't wrap my head around the fact that ships with lowest range are one of the slowest.also, goumindong and nightmarex, your elaborated examples matter only to you and don't matter on a daily basis. i don't have much to work with here, but it doesn't seem you have any experience with blasters at all."
5/5/2010,"dude, u just admited that u are not using blasters, u never were and never will. so in this case, u are arguing against blaster buff just because u are either afraid of blasters beeing better then they are now and your tactics of killing blaster boats with range and better dps will become obsolete or u are afraid that u will have to skill some other weapons too to use them in some situations..anyway, i think blasters should be death bringers, and that is fast and heavy death bringers. they were until two things happened: hp buff all accross the universe and web nerf. with first, we couldnt do anymore hit, melt, run tactics, u have to stay there and risk it to be: blobed or get problems with tracking since webs cannot hold stuff still anymore. with second, even if u got into ""fair"" equal fight, any sane pilot will start orbit u and slowly moving away, thus causing problems with tracking and sooner or later get into your falloff where your eft dps doesnt count anymore.i was specced pilot for gallente and i respecced to amarr and minie just because gallente became slowest hitters and meh when it came to fighting.i still rather choose lasers beacuse it gives me engagement range of 45km with scorch, 15km with mf for 90% dps of 5km ranged blasters, or projectiles for engagement range of 30km with short range ammo, good tracking and no cap usage, while ships are fast and agile."
5/5/2010,"strongly supported!long range weapons i give a crap about, but if blasters get their chainsaw-of-eve-flavor back... omg close range weapons would be so balanced and each with its own flavor, sweet!"
5/5/2010,"completely supported. i want to fly my blasterships again, even though i do love my lasers and autos lol."
5/5/2010,if you've bothered to read what i've wrote on the issue(see link in sig) you will know that that clearly is not the case.
5/5/2010,"goum likes the status quo, but wants artillery nerfed a bit so his lasers are the best choice in all situations again."
5/5/2010,"what? seriously, what is it with you and lying? the changes that i proposed boost blaster boats specifically, cruisers specifically, frigates specifically, and the only changes to laser ships (bar frigates and cruisers) are nerfs"
5/5/2010,"i'm not sure where the ""lie"" was.""battleships are largely balanced."" = you like the status quo for bs.you want local reps to be boosted to handle instant damage = indirect nerf to artilleries.if your argument is that lasers are not the best choice in pvp, i guess that can be debated. overwhelmingly, most people would argue that lasers are the best choice in pvp though, bar mid-range, where high damage artillery ships shine.at the same time as boosting local reps, you switch the local rep bonuses from several gallente ships with the resist bonuses on several amarr ships. net change? amarr have bonuses for the new and improved local reps and gallente are left with incompatible fitting options (higher built-in resists mean a plate is a better choice than resistance mods, but plates slow your ship down which you don't want on a blaster ship).you are arguing against a boost for blasters in this thread, remember, yet claiming you propose a boost for blasters?these points withstanding, i agree that cruisers and frigates need to be reworked as the roles laid out for them in 2003 have been completely overshadowed or removed by other ships since that time.oh, i also don't agree with this ""nerf t2"" talk."
5/5/2010,"and what did i change about bs balance? you didn't actually check did you?uhhh. are you reading the same thing that i am reading? because that is not what i suggested and that is not what would happen in either caseuhh, yea you didn't read it did you? not only did i not suggest that(neither boosting local reps in that manner, or giving amarr those bonuses), but to suggest that resistance bonuses are worse than rep bonuses. man what? you should just hang your hat in shame at that one. seriously, you should not be having any discussion on balance if you think that one.i am arguing against a boost for blasters. because boosting blasters is a terrible idea. it will not fix the problem and will simply create more whines, just like the laser boosts and the ac boosts.what ""nerf t2"" talk? no one suggested that."
5/5/2010,"you can lament all day long here goumindong, blasters will get boosted.its only a matter of time... so please for the sake of god...stfu, gtfo of the forums for once and get some fresh air... you seem to be in urgent need.and people... stop replying to him. he is a fanatical anti-gallente troll (and some kind of wannabe-assembly-hall-celebrity).according to the time he spends trolling gallente-balancing related threads he has absolutely no life at all. he is doing such since years now!dunno what this is all about, but maybe he is trying to force a meme and wants to become a forum celebrity or something.you can't argue with him, because he will always find another excuse and twist your words, so just ignore him. he throws unrealistic dps numbers into discussions (not considering falloff etc.). when you tell him, that his numbers are off, he babbles something about ""its not all about the dps"".sorry mate... but you are just ridiculous.i eagerly await your whines when something will finaly be done about the blaster problems."
5/5/2010,"you made the maelstrom a more agile battleship (because turning was apparently a problem). you gave the mega longer lock range and increased scan strength (neither matter if the ship can't get into range). you made the hype slightly faster, which is a slight boost to a solo blaster fit.""for battleships, the fitting of repair/boosters units needs to be brought down closer to the level of 1600mm plates/extenders..."" this is a huge boost to local reps: the ability to fit more reps than could be fit previously.astarte gets resists, loses reps. absolution gets reps, loses resists. brutix gets a resist bonus, loses rep bonus. while i'm at it, wtf omen?i highlighted the part where you agree with me. you don't want to boost blasters, you think a little more speed or a little extra targeting range/strength is what they need.small boosts that are diminished when you also boosted other ships.you want to cut the skill requirements for them. effectively, everyone who has put the time in to use them will be left with having trained to level 5 (if you forget doing this, the jump from lvl4 to lvl5 is extremely long) as being a minor boost in damage. making t2 the ""baseline"" means the training people put in does not provide as much of an advantage as it used to. less advantage = nerf."
5/5/2010,do not feed the troll
5/5/2010,do not argue with goumindong
5/5/2010,"sometimes i think he sincerely believes this stuff (i mean, he wrote a 19 page document) and a little rational criticism is all it will take for him to realize that he is wrong. then he argues that the rokh is bordering on being an overpowered ship."
5/5/2010,"no the rokh is truely an op ship it was proven with math ,why cant you still accept it?"
5/5/2010,"how about we continue this here. no need to clutter this thread with discussions that are not towards the merits of the proposal in the op, which is about increasing the range or damage on all blasters because of a perceived inadequacy of the weapons.if only you had rational criticism.still waiting on that explanation for how repair amt bonus > resist bonus by the way ;)the nickname for eve has always been ""spreadsheets online"". and its not because the math doesn't correspond to the gameplay."
5/5/2010,"pretty simple, yet can be useful."
5/5/2010,me like it
5/5/2010,"it's obviously both, or people wouldn't be trying so hard to take away one facet (the hand-eye coordination) part of it. i suck at manual piloting (old and slow), but i wouldn't really want to see it dumbed down.not supported."
5/5/2010,"i doubt ccp would go for that particular suggestion. i believe they've said before they don't want to make local any more of an intel tool then it already is. don't get me wrong, i wouldn't object to that change, but i doubt they'd go for it. combined with the removal of portraits, it would be an amazing intel tool! but i'd settle for just removing the portraits."
5/5/2010,supported.
5/5/2010,"you have my support for bms on grid showing in space.perhaps a per-bm checkbox (or per-bm-folder) to say if you want it displayed? that is possibly terribly processor intensive, though."
5/5/2010,good idea.
5/5/2010,yes please
5/5/2010,great ideas!+1
5/5/2010,more interesting low-sec? im in
5/5/2010,+1 for this idea tessen.
5/5/2010,"this is a fairly standard utility that eve doesn't have. we can change our portraits and quite possibily our avatar come eve: incarna. we can even transfer characters to other accounts. however we cannot change our names?why is this is significant/necessary? it probably isn't for most people, not until we're able to express our characters in greater detail with incarna, but i don't imagine it being a difficult feature to impliment. technically the mechanics are already there (given names can be changed for breaches of eve's tos).it will allow those who want a more 'lore abiding' name to change it (for a price) and it will also allow ""feroxguy"" (apologies if that exists) to find something more appropriate.name change fees and limited uses will act as a deterrent for any shifty behaviour. given players are able to create ""spy alts"" and engage in other metagame activities makes a name change seem pretty harmless anyway. the best deterrent however would be to create an in-game 'persona' or 'alias' history that mimics employment history. so in summary:-paid name change-limited changes per account-in-game alias history-very long cool down interval between name changes (if more than one is allowed)"
5/5/2010,"should be limited to once imo, but supported.i've been wanting to change the numbers out of my name for years"
5/5/2010,"i agree that once is all that you should be able to do. with this, we can also have the name at the top rather than a 'name change' tab. for instance, it would appear like ""spaceman (aka feroxguy)"" in the information window, or maybe just have it listed under employment history.supported, as there are a few characters whose names i wish to change."
5/5/2010,"i would expand it to include during character transfers, but i would be ok with a once in a lifetime name change as long as (as bunyip states) the old name is clearly visible and we can insure that standings and everything else are associated with the character id in the database, not the name (ergo, changing your name doesn't erase the standings people have set to you).edit: and by clearly visible i mean up on the show info panel by your current name (like bunyip also said) not buried in the employment history or something."
5/5/2010,"you can already change your name via character trading. making it harder to keep track of people by reputation, in a game where reputation is so important, is just a bad idea. not supported."
5/5/2010,"identity is extremely important in eve and i can see this getting extremely messy if this proposal was introduced. even though your proposal suggests a way to track past names most people probably wouldn't bother clicking a showinfo to find this information out. if you do something naughty with your character you shouldn't be able to just change your name and ""wipe"" your slate clean, there must be consequences to your actions ingame.you've made a decent proposal but i must trust the little voice inside me screaming no and not support.-t'amber"
5/5/2010,this. not even with a name history you would get my support.
5/5/2010,"if a bunch of folks don't have the extra isk to buy plex, won't the price of plex come down?certainly, but as the price of datacores goes up, the folks who aren't farming them will start, won't they? eventually there will be more paying customers farming datacores, as opposed to inactive alts on unpaid accounts farming datacores. market will return to present status as pvpers decide to spend the couple of months training to do r&d. there will no doubt be a short term spike in prices as the supply ramps up to meet demand.this is not an exclusive market. anyone can train the appropriate skills on their characters and farm datacores. there's no barrier to entry beyond training some skills and building rep with some npc corporations."
5/5/2010,as it stands right now i can only use t2 close range turret ammo on ships using t2 close range missile ammo.
5/5/2010,i think that would make a more balanced solution to the projectile problem too. a flat cap cost changes the role of the gun as the only non-cap using gun.
5/5/2010,ask and thou shalt receive.
5/5/2010,"how does ccp tell if legit software installed on a computer is being used for macro purposes in eve or not.they don't. they can't. this proposal is ridiculous.the same software that is used to macro eve is amazingly useful for a wide variety of purposes.i would rather be more productive at work then play eve, but i don't think i'd deserve to be banned for using software at work to increase my productivity.this is a blind proposal that doesn't see the issue clearly and has put forward a ""solution"" that hurts the innocent more then those it is designed to target.come up with a good solution and i'll be behind it, but this ""i hate macros, lets make eve ****"" talk is just stupid.and no..... i don't macro.... and i don't encourage it within my corp..... but i do enjoy that eve isn't full of mini-games, software scanners and other harebrained ""solutions""."
5/5/2010,"again i think that there are different topics being discussed here.the macros you are referring to (keyboard and mouse macros) are something that are caught in a broad definition of the term, and an eula needs to be broadly defined so that it's hard to get around its wording.the kind of 'macro' that is being opposed is the software that runs the eve client automatically without any input from a human being and is specifically designed for that purpose alone.strictly these are not macros, but applications or scripts. unfortunately the same kind of technology is used for keyboard and mouse macros, so it's hard to tell the difference from the server side.my suggestion would be that it would look for specific software known to be used explicitly/exclusively for running an eve client. it's not hard to find them, and then if that software (again, being very specific here) is installed, the eve client won't run.ccp has every right to have their software not run if they know (for certain) that the eula is being breached. having software installed which has the sole purpose of breaching the eve eula is a pretty good sign.if it's legit macro software used for productivity, then that comes under a grey area as it could potentially be used to breach the eula, but it also could be legitimate, so i would take an ""innocent until proven guilty"" approach."
5/5/2010,"if this proposal is for anything like blizzards approach then people are being banned simply for having the ""wrong"" brand of keyboard."
5/5/2010,"actually, one of the brilliant things about eve is the way the design minimizes the number of commands that need to be passed from client to server. in most mmos you're making keystrokes and clicks many times a second, all of which turn into commands that have to go to the server. in eve, that's reduced by several orders of magnitude.and i'm not suggesting logging every single keystroke and mouseclick of every user. i'm suggesting that once you are 99% sure you're dealing with a macro, you turn on logging for that user to get sufficient data to fully bust them. on the other hand, if you feel that someone unloading their cargohold every 323,431 milliseconds exactly is enough evidence, then you don't need to log anything beyond that.on an interesting side note: when you ban a macro-miner (or automated gold-farming bot, or what have you), usually the person you ban just goes and buys a new cd key. on a business model where each cd key costs $40, that gives the game company a lot of revenue from replacements for banned accounts. on the other hand, ccp makes their money on subscription, and little on up-front software costs. so maybe the same enforcement incentive isn't there in this case.then again, the new accounts still have to train up chars to fly the mackinaws or hulks. or buy said characters off the market. either way, ccp should see increases of account subscriptions for that training... but the revenue stream is much more murky here than with other games."
5/5/2010,"323,431 + random()x + random()y + random()how again does timing or click position mean anything?creating hurdles for bots just creates an interesting and challenging new game for them to play.macro creators love these hurdles, they are the things that make them feel clever.more hurdles = more+better macrosproposals such as this do very little to macros but instead just hurt legit users.come up with a fresh non-intrusive and effective solution instead."
5/5/2010,"dear captainsa suggestion, for high sec. systems:a broadcast from concord requesting answer to a question, or filling in, a random alphanumeric provided from concord, in a dialog box , in random time intervals. thank you"
5/5/2010,"well actually other mmos do it, heres a clip from the competitors press release based on a warden account ban.""in keeping with blizzard's aggressive stance against cheating in world of warcraft, we banned over 30,000 accounts in the month of may, and with that removed well over 30 million gold from the economy across all realms. the banned accounts were taking part in activities that violate the game's terms of use, including using third-party programs to farm gold and items, which severely impacts the economy of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.""this press release is a couple years old, but in terms of eve currency that probably equates to about 3 trillion isk.so yes it can be done because its been proven successful. simply put ccp buys the macro software, looks at the code, and then writes its own specific code to detect it. the code is then implemented, accounts running these specific applications are flagged, reviewed and banned. youre not going to beat that solo programmer who writes his own macro, those guys will keep writing them just to try to beat the ccp guys at their own game, but the guys who are writing the code explicitly to make a profit on ccp ip will walk due to the constant investment in time and resources to make their programs function. it will no longer be profitable. nor will it be profitable for people who get banned due to the amount of time required to get another hulk pilot skilled and back out making isk using a new macro application only to have it detected and banned again.java [edited for typo]"
5/5/2010,"mining is an afk activity. you don't need a macro because the game does everything for you without input until your ship is full or the asteroid dies (in both cases, this can take over an hour). what do you need a macro for?mining is like shooting a pos. turn on ts, turn on guns, turn on the tv."

5/5/2010,"this proposal was up on the last csm meeting, but there was some confusion as to what was intended.let me clarify this, if i can.i would want a new extra rightclick option, which should only appear if you are a ceo with the majority of the votes in your corp. this new rightclick option should be stating ""automatically lockdown this bpo"" and if you click yes to that, your bpo should be locked down without a 24 hour delay and without the need for a vote process.the reason this change would be beneficial is that normally you have to go through a long and painful process just to get to the voting option for a new bpo (see op) and then you have a needless 24 hour waiting period, where the other share holders can vote - but if you have the majority of the shares, why the delay? after a concluded vote, the ceo has to actually approve of the vote too.that is really tedious and a waste of time for players, who are usually doing a lot of tasks in eve too. sure, we all play eve, but ceos (and working directors) are very likely doing more than ""joe random player"". why not help the ceos save some time and be less annoyed at a ridiculously bureaucratic process?so, in short, please support this proposal."
5/5/2010,"this module will have one purpose only and that is to cause your ship to self destruct and do major harm to others.in addition to the initial self destruct aoe damage it will also do a secondary ew function tootheir suicide aoe will be 10km and do race specific damage, default damage set at 50% x base hp totalfor example, amarr suicide module - will do em damage only, so say your ship has a base hp of 10k and you activate this next to 2 people they will each receive 5k dmg @ 0 resistsin addition to this the ship will give off a second type of aoe.amarr - everything in a 25km radius will have a minor penalty to optimal range and tracking of turrets (like tracking disruptors)caldari - everything in a 25km radius will jammed (like ecm)gallente - everything in a 25km radius will have a minor penalty to targeting range and scan resolution (like sensor dampeners)minmatar - everything in a 25km radius will have a increased signature radius and a reduction in speed (like webs / target painters)the module will have a 5 second activation timer before exploding, you will be unable to move / warp and the only way to prevent exploding is to be destroyed before the 5 seconds are up.activating this module will cause you to have all your resists reduced by 50% too (this wont affect the damage given out but will obviously affect your hp), you can use this in all space however the second you activate it in hi sec you will immediately get aggression and attacked by concorde careless of if you are close to someone or even if you deactivate.uses, similar to a last stand protocol, like a upgraded version of 'self destructing' only with style.you can deactivate this module by clicking it however your penalties will still remain.this can be fitted on anything that has hi slots, is useful for caps in the event of traps"
5/5/2010,"words can not describe how horrible this idea is, please give it some more thought next time."
5/5/2010,does concord get to kill your pod?
5/5/2010,he is our troll for this week. what do you expect?
5/5/2010,don't feed the troll.
5/5/2010,"there is a nice risk reward mechanic involved in this, it would be a nice addition to super caps, just in case something goes wrong.several self destruct mechanisms work like this in general and it would make a great addition.i forgot to mention pos will get a anchorable structure that has this too, however the range will change, i will make a seperate thread about it laterpeople obviousily wont be able to abuse this as you in effect lose your ship, using it in hi sec while allowed is very difficult todoit makes up for not having bombs in low sec too and is a nice ability too, i always find before a ship dies that their should be some 'last stand' offensive attack, ideal against blobs too.imagine this, a big 0.0 alliance invading a small alliance, the small alliance is limited to stealth bombers and suicide bombers only, however the big alliance will have nothing but super caps and caps.as it is now the big alliance will win, i understand big alliances are threatened by this but surely this change wont cause you to lose space."
5/5/2010,people already can self-destruct. super caps do it often to prevent the attackers from getting a killmail (and still get the insurance payout). add aoe and you will assuredly have a fleet self destruct in jita for lolz on a regular basis.
5/5/2010,"as i said concorde will intervene in hi sec well before they explode, this will also be a module so the chances of a dread sacrificing a weapon / siege mod for this wouldnt happen (unless their plan was to suicide.it would create 'surprising situations', plus 5 sec gives alot of time for weaker ships to escape, the damage raidus is worse than bombs but it could change the outcome of a battle and create some interesting situations.imagine spotting several ships which you cant take out alone, solution is either to bomb or now suicide gank, give them a dread bubble them and in 5 seconds 700k+ dmg will be dealt.most sci fi related stuff have some 'last stance' protocol, this is generally why a self destruct is there and this would make a great addition.i understand you feel threatened but this would only add creativity to fleet fights again yet not as op as dds"
5/5/2010,"threatened? i would use this a lot. you could grab some rokhs, take off the fittings (except this module), platinum insure them, and run through 0.0 until you happen upon a camp, then sd. way more fun than build-a-rokh-sd-a-rokh for isk."
5/5/2010,"has anyone else noted that caldari will jam everyone, while the other effects are described as minor? i foresee many blokhs."
5/5/2010,"it would be far more effective using lockbreaker bombs tbh, i did think having a 'neut' aoe on amarr ones but void sd seems a little opthe jamming itself will affect everyone so it wouldnt really work well unless you go in solo first anyway"
5/5/2010,"so, fit to a small sig frigate with heated shield hardeners and shield booster, activate module when close, all ships, no, sorry, all enemy ships lose locks?or a few max shield extended discoing (or fof shooting) bsses?since you won't need a lot of skills and it is only needed as a throwaway thing, this can be done by an alt is about 2 months. then alt-tab back to your main and see a severely weakened enemy blob.now many people would not dream to bring an alt to a fight because they require maintainance in time, but this would be a game-breaking side dish.(oh, and in before the lag monkeys)"
5/5/2010,"skill wise i was going to leave that open for discussion but i did think about the person having bomb deployment v in order to use this, plus if this happened and people used a frig, considering the penalities you get it would be very hard to set off.saying that the ecm wont have a 100% jam, i wont bother with numbers atm and not to mention 25km radius for 1 aoe jam isnt really all that op but for the sake of numbers lets say its 50% of the ships current sensor str so a rokh would only be 12 str jam"
5/5/2010,"currently from radar loot you can get things like second hand parts etc which are used to create data interfaces for invention. you also get the blueprints for data interfaces.however because data interfaces are hardly destroyed they will probably become pretty much worthless if you are stuck on a stack of interface blueprints and not enough new players will do invention to make them worth creating in the future. that means that second hand parts, electronic links, elemental crux etc will also be worthless. i currently find myself leaving the parts to create interfaces behind because i have too many.i think the csm should look into the radar loot and maybe see if the parts to create interfaces can be used for other things. interfaces should degrade over time and be unrepairable like t2 crystals. this would ensure that the market for interfaces (and their construction components) would not be in vain."
5/5/2010,rumor has it that tech ii bpo's are getting killed. if that happens invention is going to increase to fill the void. i doubt anyone is going to say much on the subject though.
5/5/2010,"regardless of whether or not t2 bpos exist, there will remain an upward limit on demand for data interfaces because they do not die."
5/5/2010,"with 'new' players coming in every day, possible inventors in the future, there won't be much of an upward limit."
5/5/2010,"since the new probe system every noob and his brother are doing exploration and now the market is flooded with interfaces and bpc's of them so those things are now worth very little. i would say go into low sec but i have not found anything different in low sec that i can find in high sec when it comes to radar sites. so null sec is your best bet for better radar loot such as ship data interfaces.personally i would like to see exploration take a lot more skilling to stop so many people getting into it and make sites harder to lock thus needing most exploration skills at 4 or 5 to get a lock. i use to enjoy doing wormholes too but now i can't even find one that does not have people living there and since they can probe me out in less than a min, kinda pointless. i'm just frustrated with exploration in general. i cant even go into low sec without either getting probed out in seconds so i have to run and i waste so much time or if i stick to high sec i have to compete with 2 month old toons for 4/10 deadspace and such. then i get called a carebare for running plexes in high sec just cuz i dont want to pvp in a ""pve"" fit vs 5 people that are pvp fit. i also dont want to fly with a gang to explore cuz then i have to split the profit which sucks these days cuz everyone doing exploration and prices are crap which is the root of the problem. hmmm i may make my own thread on the exploration topic but i doubt people will see it my way and i really doubt ccp would to."
5/5/2010,"you really think new inventors enter the game as fast as that loot drops? i mean, at any given time there are a hundreds (thousands?) of radar sites available to explore in the game.the player base is growing, but no where near that fast (especially because only a small number will go into invention)."
5/5/2010,"easy solution - damage interfaces on each use so they are destroyed eventually, there limit is gone and the prices are back up until they reach some balanceinterface and decryptor prices fell so much(since i started exploring over a year ago) i don't even bother with radars anymore. interfaces are worth 1/10th of what they used to, decryptors are at 1/5th probably"
5/5/2010,"tech i bpo's don't die, only tech ii crystals die giving laser users a huge cost savings over ammo users, scripts don't die...is there a legitimate reason why they should be a consumable? these things are found from anomalies right? the most profitable profession needs a boost?"
5/5/2010,this is a good idea.
5/5/2010,"t1 bpos have a base price because they are sold by npcs. if they were dropped like data interfaces, they would sell for next to nothing in no time. crystals... scripts... don't die? you could argue modules don't die. for that matter, you could argue ships don't die. oh wait... have you seen how often ships with all those modules/scripts on them go boom? they die all the time.i don't think you've tried exploration if you think it is the most profitable profession. if you are referring to the ability to find w-space and make big isk ratting there, i think that is a different argument entirely. you have to understand, when people find the radar sites, they get grumpy, then move on to find something else."
5/5/2010,"with the current local chat, there is no point of seting up an ambush, because you know a ship just ratting in a belt is a bait ship if there is 10 other reds in the same system(or a couple jumps away, which can be easily known without probing or watching gates)i say just delete the participant list on local chats."
5/5/2010,"yeah, bait&blob needs a boost pls fix ccp ok."
5/5/2010,"only supported if static belts are removed and made part of the exploration system. that way, everyone has to work for what they are after"
5/5/2010,"whs already defacto require that you use a covops cloaking ship or alt with covops cloaking ship to catch people. which is cool, because you have variety and stuff, and people who like that system have something to do.however, i really do not support making all of eve the same as whs. the current system enables you to find targets w/out a heavily specialized ship (or alt), but it also enables those targets to see you coming if they're watching local which makes for a rather reasonable system.but yeah, removing local would have to go hand in hand with something like that, else you completely break all non-exploration stuff."
5/5/2010,i remember reading an old devblog which mentioned that they were planning to remove static belts and add them into the exploration system but allowing the basic system scan to scan down some of the lower end belts while leaving the higher ends only findable via probes.
5/5/2010,could probably make some noise here (questions for today's ccp hammerhead interview).
5/5/2010,"it works in wormholes, why not lowsec/nullsec. not to mention, it makes covert ops ships much more valuble in gangs because of scanning power. this would fit perfectly with the deep safe changes coming."
5/5/2010,"again, ""no local"" would destroy regular pvp. do you know why there are occasional carrier losses in w-space? because w-space is so safe that you can rat in carriers. that's what ""no local"" does. catching people ratting is rare. in fact, i would guess more people die to sleepers than to pvp in w-space."
5/5/2010,this. i can't believe how easily trolled some people are :d
5/5/2010,"it is almost a good idea, but entered the epic fail zone when it went to losec. you go to losec/nulsec/wspace... you take your chances.now in hisec... concord offers consequences, but not protection. the consequences are obviously too low, as one can find suicide-gank grief squads anywhere you find high-end mission running. who hasn't seen the wad of sensor-boosted fully-insured cheap bss waiting for a tengu to undock?make the consequences a tad stiffer for obvious non-wardec, hisec griefing. one day ban every time a hisec illegal kill takes place. three day ban after the 5th kill within 30 days.not too harsh for those who still cannot live without carebear tears or really must have the loot from that iti5 full of bpcs, yet may tweak the killing down a tad on those who just want to play with their shineys in hisec.another alternative is all insurance is voided for any player who takes part in non-sanctioned hisec pvp as the aggressor. this option would allow for serious griefers to not only get a kill, but possibly get a newb to aggress first and lose his insurance as well as his ship.just a mental exercise really, as nothing like this will ever happen.------------"
5/5/2010,"i am here to propose a complex solution for e-war. this proposal is based on following opinions: there need to be several e-war types viable in a game, all equally viable and important. the worst of them need to have counters. i am not discussing target painters here, as they are very different from most e-war types, and i do not see much wrong with them. target painting drones are worthless (5% sig rad. bonus per drone and a stacking penalty, really?), apart from that everything is fine. so, we have following pieces of e-war and there counters at the moment:warp scrambler/disruptor- warp core stabs. webefier - afterburner/mwdtracking disruptor -tracking computersensor dampener- sensor booster.energy neutralizers - energy vampires or any module that improves cap.now, let's look in more detail. first of all, i think warp disruptors and webbers work as desired. when we get into other types of e-war, there is some attention needed. every single module-counter has a positive effect upon it's ship-carrier that generally improves it's performance, that provides incentive to fit that module, as it will be usefull even if no e-war of that type is applied to your ship. vampires help you with cap, sensor booster provide faster lock time and lock range, tracking computer improves your effective dps by improving accuracy of your guns. eccm drains your cap and does nothing. yes, ladies and gentlemen, if a falcon does not show up on the field, eccm is totally worthless, it's an empty slot, even worse because if it was empty, you could at least use it as a heatsink when overloading. now, let's look at effects e-war has on combat effishiency of a target:web/scram- decreases target velocity, making it harder for target to avoid damage. also traps target in place, preventing it from running. target still fights back with full power.sensor dampener -decreases target's lock range, meaning target cannot fire on you, unless target get's close to you. only useful when you can outrun your target. target can still remoterep. stacking penalty present. energy neutst- shuts down target's active tank. if taken to extreme, target might not be able to fire cap dependant weapons. only used on large vessels and specialist ships. target can still fight back, in case of buffer tank and buffer independent weapon it has no effect upon combat capability of the target. victim can counter it by getting out of relatively short neut range, disabling cap intensive modules.tracking disruptor - can decrease amount of incoming damage by decreasing optimal range and tracking of turret based ship. useless against drones, missiles, doomsdays, bombs. only useful when fighting a less mobile target, when you can outrun target and stay out of it's optimal, and when you can keep your transversal above his tracking. has no effect on remote-reps, energy transfers, so on. stacking penalty present. ecm - stops any remote effects from the target. no damage, no remote reps, no shooting, nothing. not only that, but eccm is worthless on small ships, as it cannot boost their sensor strength enough to resist ecm. this is also the only non-numerical e-war type without a stacking penalty. what i suggest we do: add a stacking penalty to ecm. you cans still jam the same amount of people. however putting more then 3-4 jammers on one target wont work anymore though. that means that if someone has 2 eccms fitted, they are nearly unjammable. i find it fare, that if one dedicates two full slots to countering one specific e-war type out of 6 total e-war types, he deserves some fair protection from that e-war type. after all, how useful is arazy against a ship with two sensor boosters? why should target painters (the poorest of all e-war types) have a stacking penalty, and ecm should not?"
5/5/2010,"as well eccm needs to have no stacking penalty. what that means? yeah, if someone really hates your falcon, he can put 8 mid slots full of eccm and never get jammed. i think that is fair. same goes for sensor backup arrays. now, apart from that, the percentage bonus needs to be replaced with a numerical value, so that eccm is equally useful for all types of ships. say each eccm adds +20 sensor strength. now, if a captor, frigate, marauder, carrier ships fit that, they all gain same amount of protection. this is a eccm nerf on carriers, does nothing for battleships, boosts eccms usefulness to everything else. ofcourse exact figures might need adjustment, but i think i got the general idea across. now, this is still the only module that is useless to fit if you dont meet an ecm boat, so what shall we do? initially i wanted to merge it with sensor boosters, because logically these things should be co-related, but that would essentially render the ecm boats worthless, as everyone and there grandma would fit a module that makes them invulnerable to sensor dampeners, ecm, and makes them lock faster. so, for a lack of better idea, lets merge function of eccm and a passive targeting system. i think this is about the best choice weve currently got, which makes the module at least marginally useful. as an alternative it could allow you to lock more targets.sensor backup arrays: this module sucks. it gives you very little sensor strength and takes off damage mods/tank. i have three options, and i cannot decide which one should go through:1) remove the sensor strength boost and let it allow for unconditional acquisition of one target. no matter what happens, lock on that one target will be maintained. 2) merge its functionality with singal amplifier: that way you get a module that is gonna help with eccm and damps, and gives you targeting speed. 3) as an alternative, merge it with signal amplifier and let it reduce sensor recovery time by half. so, you only spend half of the time jammed, as you normally would. this means that for each one of these modules you would need twice as many jammers on you, as you normally would, to permajamm you. i fundamentally disagree with the way ccp made marauders particularly vulnerable to only one type of e-war. why make them only vulnerable to ecm, not neutrolisers, wbefiers or anything else? the logic is beyond my understanding. if it was for me, i would like to redo the entire sensor system and tie ecm, eccm, damps and sensor boosters together logically."
5/5/2010,"fixed sensor strenght will make unprobable frigs easy, but everything else will stray behind. i want to be able to fit together an unprobable loki, with fixed sensor strength.now making the low slot module give a fixed (lower, say +15) bonus and the mid slot an active bonus as is now might be a lot better. this would fix part of the stacking problems as well.about stacking for incoming ecm: that i can see as useful, the % calculation should not be very hard."
5/5/2010,"although i do not exactly agree to your proposal as a whole, i love the idea about eccms and passive targeters being merged together. this will give some more, really need usefulness to both of these modules.so, you get my 1/2 support :)p.s: please bear in mind that i'm not an ecm pilot, so, sorry for my dogmatic approach, i'm not going to argument why i don't agree with the ecm changes, as i am an eccm pilot :)"
5/5/2010,"unprobable ships mecanic is, to be honest, stupid, how on earth does sensor strength make any ship easier/harder to scan down? i say we just replace scannability of all ships with a fixed value, and that's it, end of story."
5/5/2010,hehe 0 support as it should remain :p
5/5/2010,"i've asked this same question many times. people get downright militant if you suggest this shouldn't happen though.back to the idea of eccm v ecm. fitting 1-2 eccm on most ships would defeat ecm, by making it significantly less likely to be jammed. the only time when this is not true is when an ecm ship is fit specifically for your ship (i.e. they know exactly what you are flying and have had time to prepare). in that case, ecm should jam the crap out of you - working as intended. the reason people complain about ecm is because there are no other benefits to fitting eccm, unlike other ewar counters. this should be the counter to ecm."
5/5/2010,"i fear it risks undermining the fact that the underlying ecm mechanic needs to be looked at (chance based, thumb-twiddle).all the ewar needs a going over to bring it up to speed with the numerous changes to modules and ships that have taken place.but, if you want to limit yourself to treating a symptom by buffing eccm, try this out:eccm (both mid and low) keep their +% boost but with a second static modifier of <10. which one is used depends on the ship it is fitted upon so that a bs gets the % value and smaller ships get the static .. whichever yields higher strength.add to that your idea of having eccm directly counteract the ecm by reducing jam time up to a maximum of ~50% (ie. around 10s). to get that maximum reduction you would need 3-4 modules so that ecm is not made completely useless. perhaps let it be determined by ""base sensors"":""boosted sensors"" ratio up to the ceiling to allow smaller ships using the static modifier to get there with fewer modules.passive targeters are useless no matter what you tag them on, you very rarely need/want to target more than what is allowed for a given ship and the skill is dead-fast to train (rank 1).by making eccm actually influence not just the chance of a jam but the quality of the jam you are more than half-way towards a bearable system and wont need artificial (read: useless) effects to be slapped onto eccm..only because it treats a symptom and not the disease. ecm on the whole is phenomenally broken as a mechanic and module both and needs some serious attention .. but it must be done without breaking the caldari as it is all they have. damps are 'meh' but gallente t2 ewar boats are still in use thanks to the second point range bonus, minnies are still used despite the web hit and the amarr were able to weather the neut/nos change by spamming cap injectors on everything."
5/5/2010,"so every ship should be scannable? that i oppose vigorously!either a module is made to lower scannability, or the game as it is now is nothing like the new situation."
5/5/2010,rr ( involved in a fight ) needs to get docking timer.nothing needs to be done to docking for non agressed ships.lamers need to get off the stations and go find a real fight.
5/5/2010,how about just increasing the docking timer when you engage in aggression? one minute is awfully short.
5/5/2010,"if rr was aggression and got criminal flags, life near empire stations would be dramatically different. however, that would not fix docking games in 0.0."
5/5/2010,"perhaps had a ""boss"" skill for this unit that includes some additive measure of tracking disruption, very small signature radius, and much larger bonus mods. in my mind, what the inital idea here is to have an electronic version of the interceptor..which in general is not a hateful idea."
5/5/2010,"so, basically you want the ewar cruisers being able to have support from ewar frigates when bridging?why not give hacs covert ops cloak too so they can support the ewar cruisers? and then give afs covert ops cloak to support the ewar frigs.not supported, and tbh there is not much wrong with the ships, they are damn powerful in frigate class engagements, and are flimsy for a good reason."
5/5/2010,please no. there are already far too many cloaking ships in the game and there are heavily used and all cloaking gangs are too commonplace.eas are meant to be frigate equivalents of the combat recons. there are already two classes of covert ops cloaking frigates. might as well put covert ops cloaks on every ship. lame.
5/5/2010,"it'd make more sense to actually move the combat recon's out of the covert tree and into an eas tree (instead of needing covops 4 as a prerequisite, force recons need eas 4)as for eas themselves, i've had a quick fly in a sentinel and while it was fun they're far too fragile for their cost so, as others have said, an increase in hitpoints would help."
5/5/2010,"how about this, have two types of electron frig? have one being a combat frig that is tougher and one a covert ops which has a cloak.the two recon ships would have the covops and eas skills as prerequisite as you suggested like the command ships have logistics and has skills as prerequisite."
5/5/2010,this. wholeheartedly supporting. how do we know they suck? because only about 20 ewar frigs are sold every day in jita. just the crow alone outsells them over twice as much every day. i've only had one pilot fly them consistently in my entire pvp career.
5/5/2010,"...instead of piling on more content.here's a few examples out of many hundreds that it could fix:+drone interface+corp management interface+the login queue hanging up and not logging us in when till we exit and restart eve even though we're #2 in the queue+blasters/railguns+exploration sites dropping useless large t2 bpc's+zooming in on our pods when our ships explode so that our computers lag out (even if we have ship explosions turned off)clarification: essentially, the next big patch should mostly include design (user interface, etc.) and bug fixes. gameplay/mechanic fixes (like hybrid rebalancing) should be secondary; throwing in too many at once would probably create more problems than it would fix. however, a few gameplay changes should be fine."
5/5/2010,here's a few examples out of many hundreds that it could fix:+drone interface+corp management interface+the login queue hanging up and not logging us in when till we exit and restart eve even though we're #2 in the queue+blasters/railguns+exploration sites dropping useless large t2 bpc's+zooming in on our pods when our ships explode so that our computers lag out (even if we have ship explosions turned off)
5/5/2010,supporting my on topic!
5/5/2010,"i support your listed topics that need some work but i would not support a new update soley to fix old mechanics. the chances that something could get broken even more while they fix everything would probably be very high due to the complexity of the game and code. i would however support incrimental fixes like they already include in each patches, but on a larger scale.do you however have any solutions for these issues, specifically for the blasters/railguns balancing? if you do please post here or share with me in a convo.-t'amber"
5/5/2010,"i think hybrids definitely need reduced powergrid, especially rails but blasters too. for example, 200mm autocannon ii's, the largest small autocannons, require 9 cpu and 4 powergrid while light ion blaster ii's, the smallest small blaster, also require 9 cpu and 4 powergrid. autocannons end up doing more damage than blasters since it's almost always possible to fit the largest ones, whereas people end up mixing neutrons and ions most of the time.other than that, there's many things that can be done, such as increased tracking and damage. gallente ships in general need more speed (but not more agility) so that they can quickly apply their damage and can actually get in range without dying.for the purposes of this proposal, though, the details aren't important. if ccp devotes enough time to fixing the little things then they'll find a good solution for hybrids and for the other things that need to be fixed.the main purpose of my proposal is to fix design issues, like the drone interface. mechanics, like blasters and such, are definitely secondary.t'amber, it's probably a bad idea to make tons of gameplay/mechanic changes at once since we wouldn't know how they work together, but a few mixed in with many design changes should be fine."
5/5/2010,well i kind of want the next expansion to have walking in stations. but a wis + over 9000 bug fixes patch would be pretty nice.
5/5/2010,so ratting in ultra-pimped bs should have no risk at all? really!
5/5/2010,"if this gets implemented, changes should also be made so we chould fight against concord, and ecm/neut concord or blob them(ofc with a sec hit)"
5/5/2010,"are you capable of more than platitudes? tell me about this no risk thing. im interested, but i dont see it."
5/5/2010,"and i like how idiots like u keep saying that high sec is supposed to be a special sanctuary free from the ""horrors"" of the rest of eve, when it's still similar to low sec and 0.0 in the sense where there is no major loss for the pirates doing the ganking and when everyone gets their insurance, buys more ships and do it all over again.u think u can take a vehicle into any war zone, lose it, and expect the insurance company to pay for that too? no, of course not. otherwise, they would void all losses in low sec and 0.0 as well. way to not think at all."
5/5/2010,"i think they should just remove insurance, i was in a .5 sec caldari system running some missions for standing and in local someone was yelling as he was getting ganked in his golem by 8 ""legion of xxdeathxx"" guys, all in battleships. they scanned him out in his mission and saw he had an a or b type sheild booster. wish i had saved the link for the kill as i can't find it now.anyway so this mission runner lost like 2 billion isk for ship and mods vs they're over insured ships that they lost really no isk as the sheild booster alone was enough for them to all make isk. i find this sad and really takes any fun away from the game. what i really get a kick at is these pro ""legion of xxdeathxx"" guys call him a noob and a carebear when really they are the sad noobs in this case calling themselves such pro pvp people by hunting down some mission runner in high sec only to gank his pve fit 1 to 8. i mean wow the skill i can't handle the skill involved in such an operation. i am humbled by the skill. hahahahahahaha,i love to pvp, but i would never do something like that even if it meant fast isk. its just lame and no real fun in my opinion. i rather join an alliance that fought for a reason such as expanding ones null or low sec space or defending vs invaders. even piracy i think is fine as it's a legit risk vs reward that also takes some actual skill and intel.- kill the insurance system plz!"
5/5/2010,"yes, but those are usually fit with heavy missiles. sad? yes. travesty? yes. potentially used as a suicide gank ship? no.yes, but that noob was in nc, and ratting while his alliance was at war. he deserved to die and be laughed at in local. name of noob: celariname of alliance: majesta empirekillmail.this was not a suicide gank."
5/5/2010,found the killmail of the person getting ganked in local while missioning. this is why insurance should be removed.
5/5/2010,"legion of xxdeathxx =/= against all authorities. also, i'm extremely impressed that the gang was able to identify a ship that had all that expensive gear on it and assemble a gang to attack it without the mission runner getting suspicious. i mean, if i had a boat that expensive, i'd be a lot more careful about flying it.he wasn't in a huge mission hub, so he had to notice someone scout him, then 10 guys show up in local a bit later.here's an api verified km. he was tanking npcs for a while before they killed him. also, they got very lucky on the loot drop."
5/5/2010,"sorry about the against all authorities i thought it was them as there was a group of them flagged and in pods, but when i saw the mail i saw it was someone else and at the time that this happen there were 143 people in system. i think he warped out of the mission after one of the guys was harassing him from what i gather from watching local as he was flaming big time. then he went back thinking he left then when he got to the acceleration gate they were all waiting for him.yes this guy was noob and made a lot of mistakes but i still think ganking is wrong."
5/5/2010,"i've been concerned with lowsec as being more useful to people other than pirates, factional warfare, and pvp. i logged on to sisi to see how the changes would effect the hemorphite, hedbergite, and jaspet ores. they all do get a nice amount of minerals added to their refine yield, but it doesn't help them compete with the highsec ores. it is still more profitable to mine highsec ores over the lowsec ones.the new hemorphite yield is only worth about 6-7% more than the old one in liquid isk, without going into detail. logon to sisi if you want to know more.why would anyone ever venture out into dangerous space when there's not even a good reward for it? i'm not pushing for lowsec ores to be worth more than 0.0, but certainly more than highsec.there's still time before the expansion hits, lets show ccp we care about our pirate infested asteroid belts! make lowsec ores worth more than highsec!"
5/5/2010,"mining in losec is inherently more dangerous than mining in 0.0, because you can't secure losec space.the only way to reanimate lo-sec mining is to introduce something that can't be found anywhere else."
5/5/2010,"nullsec also sports bombs and bubbles. i've lost barges due to this. just because you can't secure it as you say does not mean its any less dangerous than nullsec. it is sad to lose 6 barges to bombers.also, these ores can be found in nullsec as well. why aren't they getting a bigger boost if just for that reason?supporting my own topic."
5/5/2010,"you are forgetting that at the same time of the buffing of low sec ores there will be a nerfing of mission loot and drone alloys, with a probable increase in value for the zydrine and loss in value for some of the minerals found in high sec. so the proportional buff of low sec minerals probably will be larger than the 6-7% you cite. that if the market follow ccp previsions, something that is not granted."
5/5/2010,"supported.what if, instead of their current changes, ccp did something like this (note: the numbers are for illustrating a concept; do not take them literally):veldspar: 333 units refines 500 veldsparscordite: 333 units refines 525 veldspar, 200 pyeritepyroxeres: 333 units refines 550 veldspar, 225 pyerite, 100 mexallon, 10 nocxium...bistot: 333 units refines 800 veldspar, 350 pyerite, 210 mexallon, 20 nocxium... 350 zydrine, 170 megacytebasically, it would never be more profitable to mine in highsec if lowsec and nullsec ores produced as much highsec minerals as highsec ores in addition to also producing lowsec and nullsec minerals."
5/5/2010,"drone compounds have less high end and more low end minerals now, close to 78% less i would say. (i don't have perfect refine, could be wrong about that). drone compounds did not make up a significant portion of the tritanium, pyerite, mexallon, or isogen. mission loot did. and with less of that being brought in due to changes in loot drops, these minerals will rise in value as well.even assuming the lowend minerals dont't rise in price, and assuming a 78% increase in price for zydrine... scordite is still worth about 40% more than hemorphite.the changes aren't enough. something else must be done with the lowsec ores to make them worth more."
5/5/2010,i will agree with the op on this one.more needs to be done to balance out mining. maybe even going so far as to make it so that only x types of ore can be found in lowsec.
5/5/2010,"they really do need to increase the value. as a miner, there really is no motivation to go and even think about lowsec mining when the risk/reward ratio is completely skewed."
5/5/2010,"this is a very clever and well thought out idea emo tj/supported, would love to see more creative ideas"
5/5/2010,emo tj and musical fist support this idea? what's the punchline? the ability for someone with starbase config to instantly turn off all the corp poss by yanking the fuel out of all of them.
5/5/2010,heheh ... tj was only worried about stront timer... but that is even more evil
5/5/2010,"how about allowing coupling arrays to link in/output hangers between various assembly arrays i.e. t2 component output hanger feeds into equipment assembly array hanger, less micromanaging all around. also please allow my blueprint list in s&i tab to show the 3 various listing options and remove the annoying auto-refresh of the list."
5/5/2010,"if you are on the corp blueprint/blueprint tab, double click on the station/lab you want to install from. it opens in a new window. switch the science and industry window to the jobs tab. start installing jobs from the new window. voila nothing auto refreshes anymore.hth"

5/5/2010,when i go to page 2 of this thread.i get this:
5/5/2010,you most likely have a virus / keylogg i think you should immediately contact ccp then format your computer
5/5/2010,disable signatures. someone has a signature on a password protected host.
5/5/2010,gone now. would've expected the forums to not allow such a thing to happen.
5/5/2010,that would require that the forum checks ever url when you enter the page. that way you could quickly dos the forums. you dont want that. :)signatures off is the better way.
5/5/2010,"it was just a bad signature link, but i fixed it. i'm going to lock this thread as it really has nothing to do with assembly hall and the issue is fixed *fingers crossed*."
5/5/2010,fail. if anything industry needs a real expansion.
5/5/2010,"hey,it's not the most burning problem, but proplem none the less. i'm really only posting this because of how annoyed i am by how much potential i see in this ship. first of all it is the absolutely worse designed ship in this game, it's a logistics t1 cruiser that doesn't have any space for it's essential modules. i can, sort of, understand the layout from a mining perspective, because (i guess?) ccp didn't want to make annother osprey, so they just, sort of, gave it 2 high slots for missiles and just 1 drone for defense? perhaps? i don't know. but why? why not give it 3 low slots, 5 medium slots, 3 high slots and atleast let it launch 3 light drones. what would this do, well for mining (to get it out of the way) it would just trade dps for tank, pretty much let your drones do all the damage and tank a bit more than an osprey; i have highsec rats in mind. but what's most important, and where the potential of this ship is, it would let the scythe do its role.my point is, this would open the ship for actual gang use. i've done gang operations in ospreys, exequrors and augorors, those ships have roles in gangs that are easily taken by newbie pilots. i personaly don't see any problem in balance with the slot change or drones, the ship has 4 real slots for its logistics, just like other t1 cruisers, the capacitor problems would be smaller or none, i guess, but then you can't really fit a capacitor booster. you won't overtank it for solo pvp either cause it barely exeeds 500 pg, anyway the ehp is very small overall, besides the dps isn't there at all. it also won't make for a gimmicky e-war platform because blackbird has more mid slots.it could make a fast, agile support to hac gangs, or bs snipe gangs, sort of give players the feel of flying a scimitar (like other t1 logistics do for their t2 couterparts), just different gang bonuses. also tracking links could finally see some pvp action, even if just a little.what you guys think? i'd love to see this ship finally in use."
5/5/2010,"scythe is horrible as balance for how fantastic the scimi is. however, it should have rr bonuses like the other tier 3 cruisers. tracking links? really?"
5/5/2010,"first of all let me start by saying that as an independent game developer and game design academic i am vehemently opposed to macro use of any kind.that said, this idea is so terrible that words simply cannot describe just how terrible it is. it's so horrid and poorly thought out that i am wondering whether it is in fact a troll post.on the assumption that it's not, i'm going to pose a scenario. due to rl concerns a player can only play (other than updating the skill queue or market orders) once or twice a week for any length of time. on the odd occasion they can play for 7-8 hours at a stretch they would like to do what they enjoy doing, either ratting, mining, or pvp. after all, they are paying for their account.if their funds are a bit short for pvp they will need to spend a bit of time filling their wallet, and of course being the conscientious player they don't cheat by having a macro do this for them. so they think, ""right, i'm going to spend my playing time ratting the belts trying to get faction spawns"".in your solution, after 2 (or however many) hours, their ship stops and won't move until downtime. so what play time this player has available is now screwed.your solution penalises legitimate players more than macro users, particularly those who aren't aware of how the internet works. all a savvy macro user needs to do is ensure that their macro includes controls so that 5 minutes before the quota time is up it will reset the adsl router or whatever is being used for a connection, and tiens viola, new ip and more macro ratting/mining.tl;dr i think the post of ""epic fail"" summed up just nicely.absolutely will not support."
5/5/2010,is there a thumbs-down option?
5/5/2010,"playing devils advocate for a moment;instead of a 2 hour or 4 hour or whatever limit per day, make it an allowance, you get 4h per day, that roll over if you don't use them.""weekend warriors"" will have 20h to make isk over the weekend and otherwise intermittent players will have huge allowances of time to use when they decide to play.of course this does nothing about market/trade/hauler ganking/scamming/moon mining ect...and there's no need to use ip when you can simply do it per account."
5/5/2010,"it's interesting how you're the only one supporting your proposal. time to log in a few of your other accts, i reckon."
5/5/2010,"honestly, this would just make macroing worse. this would increase the demand for ore. macroers are more... adept at cycling through accounts and characters than others. this means they'll just have more characters running, switching between them as their allotment for the day runs out. very few non-macroers would go through the trouble.bad idea.if you want to get rid of macroers, come up with a more complex system for hauler missions. there are fewer macro miners than you think. most mine drunk/afk/while doing something else, which is perfectly legit."
5/5/2010,"supported because i prefer that nrr's get a docking/gate aggro timer. the fix was already proposed by the pitboss' last year raised in csm3 by dierdre vaal, where it was unanimously passed by csm3.this issue is still listed in evelopedia in the ""issues in process"" category (defined as ""issues that have passed through the csm and are waiting for a response from ccp""). in response, didn't ccp agree to flag neutral remote reppers but wouldn't go for the dock/gate aggro suggestion? i couldn't find documentation to back this up. (no wonder considering how much csm back-reading i've been doing the last few weeks.) i hope someone from csm will chime in and clarify. while there are a lot of interesting suggestions here and elsewhere for fixing neutral remote repping, an aggression timer seems like the most straightforward fix. i'm curious why it hasn't already been implemented."
5/5/2010,you look like your feet smell real bad.
5/5/2010,"she'll most likely get in anyway despite being called out on just about everything. it's hilarious to once again watch her melt down in a csm thread though. keep it up! i, too, believe player killers are immoral."
5/5/2010,akdfhgfhsrfgdfsmkeh you should forget the csm and put in an app. down at fox news.
5/5/2010,people like this make me and others really think twice about the csm and its validity..
5/5/2010,"miss ankhesentapemkah your detractors have quoted you as saying ""in eve you're all irrelevant"" and that players have ""no lasting effect on the game at all"". how would you work to change this, and what does relevance and last effects mean to you?"
5/5/2010,"i see ankj more as one of the hippies on pmsnbc or perhaps npr, where we should all hold hands and understand eachother and give hugs."
5/5/2010,"i've answered this before but it got lost somewhere in the sewage in this thread.i'm game designer, and my specialities are economics and balancing. right now i'm designing a competition system, programming a piece of software that automatically generates droptables, and writing the design doc for two of our upcoming mmos."
5/5/2010,please let me know about those upcoming mmos. should be a huge success with you designing them.
5/5/2010,"i promised myself i wouldn't comment in this thread. but as i watch this train wreck unfold i fear ank might be elected and honestly, i don't think she will ""play well with others"" in csm 5 if that happens. i've heard comments from csm candidates i am confident will be elected that drive me to make these observations.if you are thinking of voting for this person let me make my case for giving someone else your vote instead.1. if you are voting for women, i am one of the handful of women running. so please if you just want to vote based on gender consider me, mazzilu or greymouse. we all share that attribute with ank and do it without the drama. ok, mazz does bring some drama, but a lot of folks would say the good kind of drama! ;-) the next csm definitely can work more effectively with the other women running.2. games or software engineering experience. several of the csm candidates are more qualified. for example i was one of the co-inventors of the programmable 3d pipeline introduced in direct x 8. i was also part of the small team that got billg to approve development of the x-box. i have 30 plus years as a software engineer of which 5 were directly in the pc gaming industry and have had formal training and certification as a scrum master. i've managed large development teams in all capacities up to the director level. i currently work developing requirements specifications and driving product teams in the mobile device industry. look into some of the other csm candidates. there are definitely some folks running with real world software industry experience.3. carebear. i am a committed carebear. ask anyone in my corporation or alliance. i want to point out i do that while still respecting folks that like the ""shooting folks in ths face"" part of eve. the individual that tried to assassinate me in the alliance pvp tourny a couple of years back ran against me in the csm 3 elections and said if you wanted someone that had provided ""years of care bear bliss"" to her alliance then folks should vote for me. again, there are some other great care bear candidates in this election.4. i'm not running to get a job at ccp. honestly, i think that is ank's goal. i think the rest of the csm candidates are doing this to make eve better and not for their careers.so in summary, please consider other candidates. i started out respecting ank when i first encountered her but over the last couple of years i worry that she is too immature, random and closed minded to be effective in the csm. i also wonder why she would run for a governing position in a game that her conversations seem to show she has such contempt for.so, please think long and hard before supporting ank. i think there are a number of folks that would do better by you if you elected them instead.i encourage other candidates with similar views of eve as those that ank is running on to offer themselves as an alternative in this thread.issler dainzefemalecarebearsomeone who likes eveowner of a car that eats mini's for snacksalso now with a campaign videoissler dainze campaign advisor videoprofessional software engineer with real games industry experience!one of a bunch of better csm candidatespushing ""post reply"" with much reluctance"
5/5/2010,"in which we find that ankh finds alternative views to her own as ""sewage"".once again would you care to comment on what experience with pvp (aside from getting ganked flying ****-fits), nullsec (possibly aside from random ratting), sov issues, and fleet battles you actually have?also...i'm pretty sure you shot yourself in the ass with regard to job prospects at ccp with your rather hatin' comments regarding eve .lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt!"

5/5/2010,"absolutely.jade constantine raised this issue but since this issue was passed on to csm2, and jade handed it to me, that's why we're both on the document.from minutes:no live events team exists. ankh analyzed other mmo live events and mentioned a few examples: uo moved in the direction of how over time companies changed having developers in game to having volunteers run events which moved on to the volunteers demanding compensation and the live events being disbanded. guildwars went the route of having automated events. ankh went on to say that a similar system could be added to apocrypha considering the new content coming in. types of events that could be introduced: story driven  outcome can affect the eve storyline or small storylines that can be played in game competition events  pvp tournaments, treasure hunts, puzzle solving automated events  temp agents appearing, convoys, luminaire titan type of thing ccp has thought about having devs to play characters in game events, unfortunately ccp devs really don't have the spare time for that  they're developing. the other risk was to imbalance the game running events in specific areas. pattern raised the point that they are events, they happen rarely to help introduce storylines. ccp responded that they do something like that through the rp storylines on the website, it's not the same, but doing it with dev's running characters, it takes away from development time. issler pointed out that corps run their own events, and if there was more ccp support to promote those events it would be great. ccp thinks that giving tools to players to create their own events are better. pattern pointed out that people have different play styles  some enjoy the guided rollercoaster, others like to create their own things. tusko brought up the old live events were done both large and small, and a lot of people enjoyed them as they added spice to the game. ccp agreed, but that stuff required an insane amount of manpower to organize that they can no longer assign manpower to. ccp has on the drawing board to link news to market events  i.e. planet runs out of wheat, wheat orders in stations near that planet start getting generated. requests like this one go into a priority list for ccp, by adding this as a higher priority, something else would have to fall down. bunyip suggest a way for players to let ccp know about player events so that they can get advertising. pattern pointed out a lack of history to eve. by having live events and people involved it can allow for viral style marketing. ccp agrees, but pointed out there are drawbacks with doing that and would require a reshuffling of priorities to allow them. artists/programmers would have to be tasked to events. issler would like for ccp to encourage the storyline in eve. it's a great backstory, it needs to be broadcast. darius thinks that by adding more storyline would impact on the ability for players to create their own stories. tl;dr csm and ccp agree that more events would be great but it is a question of priority as well as trying to allow the sandbox experience of eve to be effected by storylines as well as allowing players to affect the storylines. more 'monuments' will happen, live events are much harder to do, but they want to do it. there is no timeframe for implementation of this, but it has been added to the list."
5/5/2010,i say again:i see you manage to totally ignore all the quotes from yourself.. how do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you don't even attempt to refute -your own quotes- ?not only do your own quotes make a liar out of you - you then simply ignore any posts that call attention to them.

5/5/2010,"i still think this issue should be still pushed rather than take a back seat, i cannot see what time a short event would take from the dev's and tbh with the faction wars ongoing there is more than enough oppotunity for events to take place without interfering in player owned space or politics,ccp just stating they havent the time is a 'get out of jail free card' rp written storyline only interests a percentage, real live events taking place will interest quite a few more imooh btw thanks for answering"

5/5/2010,why issler is important?coz you don't want ccp just listen to solobobatla****.... go go go issler.
5/5/2010,"4. low sec needs smuggling!! eve has teased us with the idea of smuggling since the beginning but it never really got implemented. if i want to be be a bad person and slip about with questionable cargo low sec is where it should happen! introduce new market goods with some degree of illegality! also pick a class of ship and make it the smugglers ship of choice! the idea of smuggling could fill pages with possibilities!i think this is a good idea. ccp wouldn't even need to introduce new market goods. there are already several items (slaves, small arms, and various narcotics) that are illegal in most places in empire. buy orders could be created for these items in some low sec systems at a profitable price. the more illegal it is the more profitable it should be. just don't get caught."
5/5/2010,youtube seems to be working again. i hope you all take a chance to enjoy the results of tada o ai team!issler

5/5/2010,"mazziliu. what are your opinions on the inherent immorality of player killing? please, people, serious debate only."
5/5/2010,"when players die, they need to stay dead! itt eve is full of zombiescheck out my csm campaign video:"
5/5/2010,"a corpmate asked me to elaborate on my science&industry issue ideas on our own forums. i'll paste my response here as well:the first thought that comes to mind is poses. just pretty much everything about poses, including the interface for manufacturing, researching, and moon mining. it's a confusing interface, and manufacturing is frustrating when you need to have the minerals at a pos and inconvenient when you can't reprocess modules at a pos. most people i have seen that use assembly arrays only do it when there is no alternative- at player owned stations with little manufacturing, or t2 producers to get better speeds. the science & industry interface needs to be able to remember more settings. maybe be able to set a default build count? or don't make the player choose just exactly which of the many identical slots they want to use to make something? there needs to be work on that so there's less clicks to get something that you want done.also the assets tab needs work on it(not strictly part of science&industry but you use it a lot when organizing). it's hard to sort through your things when the bits of data aren't sorted into columns. # of jumps, and # of items, are not visually lining up. just another terrible piece of ui.there should be some sort of alert when you have jobs ready to deliver. not one every time a job completes though, it would get annoying.the ability to sort by meta level in the inventory isnt added yet still, and it should bei do not like how player owned stations are inferior to npc stations in almost every way, manufacturing and science slots included. for the sake of populating 0.0 people need more convenience in player owned stations by providing a reasonable number of slots...and finally.... and most importantly.... a way to distinguish bpos from bpcs! i dont really care if ccp rejected this idea a million times before. it can reject it a million and one times."
5/5/2010,i will be voting for mazz with one if not more of my alts.....for the boobies
5/5/2010,"what are your thoughts on interactive storytelling in eve, mainly if players should be able to greatly impact what ccp's writers will write or if those writers should have full control over where they want the story of eve to go?"
5/5/2010,"by running for csm, i am making a commitment to devote the time to csm activities. that means that it gets priority for my personal recreational time. less time spent on the robot, shows will expire unwatched on the tivo, and less time having fun in eve -- though probably more time in eve.this is entirely different from not being able to be available for a particular op at a particular time due to outside commitments."
5/5/2010,"def. better than the pandemic chick whose platform seems to be ovaries! i said pvp! vote!not voting yet, but you will probably get my 2.any thoughts on additional viability of t1 hulls? non rifter/incursus/merlin/tristan/griffen frigates? destroyers?o7"
5/5/2010,"as your former at7 homeboy, i feel obliged to vote for you since i missed the final match and you died. don't blame me though, blame the colts. if they'd had a sunday night game, i would've made it, and you wouldn't have been yelled at by shamis for dying. there's no one running that understands the game and how to improve it more than elise."
5/5/2010,"cat, you amuse me.you got votes from 5 of my characters.good luck and give those pirates no rest.mr epeen"
5/5/2010,i think if u'll become a csm i'll have a bit more targets so gl mate
5/5/2010,according to match.eve-csm.com i have to vote for you.
5/5/2010,the voting has begun! don't forget to vote!
5/5/2010,"my vote for you, old friend! good luck!"
5/5/2010,"some of you may have noticed i am running for csm. i am. you probably have noticed i put no self promotional message in the candidate space. not really that good at self promotion. i have taken some heat for not having a catchy campaign slogan. unfortunately i have no funds to pay for ad guys so until those isk orders sell on ebay i was forced to ask the small handful of people who will admit to knowing me for ideas. the results became the campaign message posted beside my name.the truth is that i have read those other messages and i have a confession to make. i don't have an intimate knowledge of all aspects of the game. i cannot glibly talk of eve economics while juggling complex formulas for determining the damage caused by a speeding missile. i haven't raised 37 issues personally before the csm and held ccp's collective feet over the fire while they made flawless changes to improve each and every one of our gameplay experiences. i do not smote the heavens causing super carriers to spring up where only asteroids belts existed. and finally dds do not shoot out of my ass.instead i can only tell you that if you have an idea, explain it to me, and if it will improve eve, i will work to see it reaches ccp. maybe just maybe they wont screw it up when they put it in.p.s. please vote for me."
5/5/2010,"thank you for your comments, i will try and give you an idea what i was thinking on each of those:smart mines, could be limited to 1 per gate, and there would be a limit to the damage they could do. it is not meant to be the only means of defending a system, it is just a means of making an aggressor think twice, and they could always be destroyed, could be a delay before the mine re-cloaks as to give an attacker a chance to remove it. this would need to have further discussion so that 0.0 is not filled with smart mines.training arena, that does have a lot of potential i agree, again needs a lot of discussion around it, but it would be useful to have in game.sub system targeting, i think that is or has been in planning for a while and i don't see it as causing that much more lag and it would make pvp more interesting.empire suicide attacks, i don't want to stop pilots being able to conduct these attacks as it is a viable tactic, i just think that pilots that do them should not receive any insurance payouts, on the ship performing the attack.marauder class ships, i feel that this class needs some work, maybe not necessary as i have stated, but there are some improvements that could be made, it should be a powerful ship, the question is just how powerful can it be.escort carrier, would be an interesting ship to have in game."
5/5/2010,"voting is now up, you can support me by following this link.vote early, vote often.also check out dierdra vaal's vote match site."
5/5/2010,"how do i get you to take on a proposal? i have some issues with corp deliveries - i want to be able to sort them by region. is that something you would be taking on, even if you are not (i presume) a trader?"
5/5/2010,"the procedure for any proposal is to raise the issue in the assembly hall. check the sticky post at the top of this forum for hints and tips on raising issues.as far as getting somebody to pick it up, you can eve mail the proposal link to the csm reps in game and one of them should raise it. i do pick up stuff outside my core gameplay when i feel it is being ignored."
5/5/2010,for those interested i did an email interview with keith neilson. there are other candidate interviews to read too and i'm glad to see the eve blogging community taking the csm process to heart
5/5/2010,"voted a couple of times for you. go-go teadaze, best of luck!"

5/5/2010,"when i look back in the years i have invested in eve online, and they are quite few, i can not neglect the fact that this game became one of my main regular habits, one of my sweet choirs, one of my, if you like, almost family members.what always amazed me was my close to the perfection will to play more and more of this game, to interact with more and more of the ingredients of this artificial but so vivid deep space world which fully surrounds me every time when i'm flying the very world i would never live to tell in real life.there are few people which are, beside the ccp employes, making that possible. since the introduction of the csm and the election process, only few, and those few are coming down to vuk lau and elvenlord, are the people for which i do solemnly believe that they are investing best of their abilities to improve my regular habit, my sweetest choir, my family member, and that they are really concerned about not only temporary moment and state of it, but the future, near and distant, as well.i do believe that vuk lau and elvenlord, as one of the most impressive, if not the most impressive experts of this game, will invest all their will, knowledge and time to make every aspect of it better, empire, low sec or null sec alike, and that they will use the power of two on this level to make coordinated and determined impact on ccp for continuing to make this game our favorite pass time of all times.vote for them by you is for you and all of us."
5/5/2010,"as ideas for the game go this is more plausable than some that i've read. however, at this time i would not bring this issue before the csm because the originator of the idea did not tidy up her room."
5/5/2010,"i'm answering these one at a time because it's late here.one of the problems that has been with eve for as long as i've been playing is that in terms of mining low-sec has been pointless with ores no more valuable than those in hi-sec, indeed even 'poor' 0.0 ores failed to be more valuable. it's something that's quantifiable where the risk-reward equation clearly goes the wrong way. now, i sincerely hope the mineral rebalancing introduced in tyrannis will help this disparity. i doubt it.low sec does offer a bunch of things that can be exploited by players in an organization that supports them - level 5 missions & factional warfare aren't generally solo affairs (and i'm not saying they should be). however the truth is that most players in empire view pvp as too risky and don't see any difference between low-sec and 0.0. and players that jump into player corps typically go straight from living in hi-sec to living in 0.0, at which point they view the rewards in 0.0 as being greater, and the pvp is easier when you don' thave to worry about sentry guns and security status.ideally, low-sec needs something unique, something that embraces those mechanics unique to low-sec. i loved the 'corruption' concept that came out of the meeting in las vegas, and while i'm really not wanting to see a lot of new content added until we clean up the old content i'd say that adding something like this to give a 'unique' angle to lowsec would be near the top of my list for new content."
5/5/2010,"the first thing that strikes me about blasters the optimal range bonus/penalty for ammo makes almost no difference to the effective range so there's no advantage to switching ammo types to anything but antimatter or the t2 ammo types. with the other short range weapon systems ammo still makes a difference, lasers have much higher optimal compared to falloff and projectiles have a selection of short range damage types available. i'd be in favour of examining changes that might deliver some advantages to switching ammunition types. there's also that eternal oddity of gallente flying 'slow' armour tanking ships and favouring guns that require the ship to get right on top of the target.at the battleship level rails lack the dps of beams and the alpha of artillery, but they get great range, however i rarely find ships engaging at the kind of extreme ranges where rails come into their own. medium rails have fitting requirements that feel a little high when you're trying to fit a t2 sniper eagle or ferox.do they need fixing? there's a lot of people who think they do, so as a csm candidate i'd certainly like to raise the issue in more detail with ccp."
5/5/2010,all my vote are belong to t'amber.
5/5/2010,"why should anyone vote for you when you cannot attend csm meetings, even during the campaign period where i would presume it would be paramount to show your worth?"
5/5/2010,"you are correct, and this issue has been mentioned a couple of posts up.although i am only an alternate i have attended all but two meetings, both times i missed without telling the secretary in advance.i did however work nightshift on both those days, and the meetings were at 6am. if i recieved a full seat i'd be willing to change to dayshift, which i have already recieved permission for from my work. that is what i'm worth.-t'amber*edit: the meetings were 5am-6am."
5/5/2010,"getting up at 5am to do something for 35 minutes does not seem unreasonable. i presume csm is not w. live video feed, so you could do it in your pajamas. if you wanted to be there."
5/5/2010,"no, not unreasonable at all if you work normal hours and usually i dont need to wear anything x)-t'amber"

5/5/2010,voting is open
5/5/2010,1st off you have my support will you be bring ideas to the board this time around that will help newer alliances to get a foot hold in null sec?i.e. sov bills don't cost as much?
5/5/2010,"yes, i believe the sov costs needs to be adjusted. there needs to be better incentive for new alliances to venture out into 0.0 and i feel dominion missed the mark."
5/5/2010,"avalloc, you have my vote, even though you're a goon."
5/5/2010,friendly bump!
5/5/2010,"by fixing these issues and tightening overall gameplay, hopefully as a result it will help weed out other issues and improve the game as a whole, keep it up, im listening."
5/5/2010,my top was dierdra vaal (70%). obviously rigged
5/5/2010,75% teadazethats my guy i guess. (or girl)
5/5/2010,illectroculus defined 85%teadaze 80%would go for tea again but that support for converting t2 bpo's is a tough call.
5/5/2010,"""ccp should spend more time fixing old content and less time introducing new content.""-received the most 'strongly agree' and the most 'important question'ccp, ffs remove head from nether regions and fix the bugs, the lag and ban the cheaters and macroers already. stop introducing new broken crap until you do.once you've done that, go back to your harebrained schemes and pie in the sky ideas.this idea that new toys attract new subscribers is poppy****. do you know what attracts new subscribers? satisfied current subscribers who love the game because it works and can't stop talking about how full of win it is."
5/5/2010,"nice tool definately, not sure it covers all the issues though, top 5 matches:mazzilliu (73%) teadaze (73%) sokratesz (72%) elise randolph (70%) omber zombie (69%)which make enough sense, however what makes no sense at all:ankhesentapemkah (63%) mynxee (63%)darius johnson (50%)"
5/5/2010,darius johnson (64%)... looks like i'll be voting goon *edit: and where the hell is cat?
5/5/2010,nothing about multiple accounts ? :\
5/5/2010,"hopefully not running. as cute as the forum trolling from that pilot is, i don't want that anywhere near csm."
5/5/2010,"interesting. i ran a ""strongly disagree"" for everything.scwarze apparently disagrees the most with everything on the list.(50% match) (he is also my least compadible when answering for real)centurax apparently agrees the most with everything on the list (17% match) (ironically my most compatible)quick statistics: the most disagreed upon question presented among the csm candidates was ""the core combat model of eve lacks complexity and is too simple."" which is sort of sad, since eve is pretty simple.the most agreed upon question presented among the csm candidates was ""bounty hunting as a profession needs some love from ccp."" and with how broken the bounty system is its no surprise.the most important question presented among the csm candidates was ""ccp should devote an expansion cycle to revamping the user interface."""
5/5/2010,thus the reason why it's an open vote. i though am also curious as to where cat is on there.
5/5/2010,"""warp disruption fields should be usable in low sec.""they are usable in low sec, the focused script is basically the whole point of hics. if you mean bubbles in low sec, that is pretty funny imo and you should call them bubbles because i've never heard anyone call them wdfs.i got:omber zombie(77%) mazzilliu (70%)alpha12125 (69%)helen highwater (67%)teadaze (67%)....dierdra vaal (55%)great tool op, won't be voting for you though. didn't know omber zombie was so cool, this tool definitely is switching my vote, was gonna go for teadaze/elise randolph now gonna go omber/teadaze."
5/5/2010,am running lol but was away for the bank holiday weekend \o/ which had the effect of me not checking my evemails and thus missing the deadline x
5/5/2010,"very nice of you to make this tool this time around too, dv.though, it seems like oz is the man to vote on."
5/5/2010,"an excellent tool! i got 65% for dierdra vaal, however i couldn't vote for this chap due to his support of:""invention and production should be made more profitable.""how exactly... in a player driven market? ban the accounts of those undercutting the market? jesus if you don't know how invention works, why should anyone vote you in when you want to do the above? hint: invention is perfectly profitable as it is now.ashina sito made me laugh... vote for him to stop people scamming so i guess i am voting for manalapan... whoever that is"
5/5/2010,great little tool for getting an idea of who to look into futher.
5/5/2010,"neat tool, but tbh, some of the questions are fairly ambivalently written  you should try to rewrite them to avoid multiple questions/statements per issue. it may not be all that serious, but the methodology is left wanting.eg. ""the war-dec system is unbalanced in favour of the agressor and should be changed."" there are three rather different things going on here: that the wardec system is unbalanced, that the aggressor is the favoured party, and that this needs to be changed. the only proper way to interpret this is if you agree with the statement as a whole, but that means that other, similar issues aren't being addressed.it also leaves open the problem of which of the parts need to be addressed and how, which is probably a more pertinent question to most. if i think that the war-dec system should be changed, but not because it's unbalanced and unduly favours the aggressor, what should i vote? if i think the system is unbalanced and in favour of the aggressor but shouldn't be changed? what if i think it's unbalanced and should be changed, but so that it favours the aggressor more  then what? etc.so just a general tip for the next time: only test one statement at a time. if someone creates a compound issue like the one above, cut it down into different parts and have the candidate in question say that they're positive (or negative) to all of them."
5/5/2010,very interesting indeed! ankh and i have about 43% in common lol.
5/5/2010,"most of the questions didn't interest me at all, they merely reflect what you find important."
5/5/2010,"kinda expected dierdra vaal 107 % match, but...ankhe will be so pleased :ankhesentapemkah (71%)vuk lau (70%)esharan (70%)meissa anunthiel (70%)...dierdra vaal (63%)...scwarze (45%)it is evident many csm candidates agree on many issues, which i hope bodes well for the next csm.so it shall be ankhe or cat. nice work dierdra vaal !"
5/5/2010,"keep in mind that you shouldnt _just_ vote for your highest match. do some research into what the candidates stand for, read their websites, talk to them, etc."
5/5/2010,"thanks for putting this up again, dierdra!"
5/5/2010,"i saw something like this on yahoo about the current uk elections, very nice.mine showed centurax as 70% followed by vuk 68% eek!very nice eitherway :)how does ccp work with multiple accounts and voting, each account gets to vote, but does it get classed as one person or can a person just have several accounts for the sake of voting?"
5/5/2010,"quite a few of the candidates landed pretty close together on my results, top ones were;dierdra vaal (68%) axexut (64%) darius johnson (61%) manalapan (61%) meissa anunthiel (59%) avalloc (59%)...on a random side note, the mess of colours and symbols on the result page is kind of painful to the eyes. any chance of a more visually friendly layout?"
5/5/2010,"two veeery similar candidates no, really, the % match is a silly criterion alone for voting. the good part bit of this site is that it enables you to see the stance of candidates on some often debated issues without having to ask them one by one in their threads.however, claiming ankh has similar views to, say, vuk is just beyond silly, one of them has expressily stated that people who violence other people's ships are immoral irl, that puzzle pirates are a better game, that people who violence other people's ships are antisocial deviants who need to get therapy irl and stuff. just check the thread ;)"
5/5/2010,"yeah i looked at the ! instead, manalapan who scored 64% had ! in most of the areas i am interested in, though she doesnt talk about some of them on her blog hmmvuk on blobbing is cool but omg @ not giving suicide gankers full insurance :("
5/5/2010,"nice tool,but it would be nicer if i could pick a list of say 3 to 5 candidates to compare to my results,the huge table it is now makes it hard to read,and there are quite a few candidates that i personally deem unvotable, so i wouldnt want to compare with those anyways.about the result: it saddens me that the best match is 65% with one of the candidates, pretty much proofs that there is none which stands for what i like about the game"
5/5/2010,"most matched is 69%least matched in 30%so i can choose between jack johnson and john jackson.jj: ""i think your two cent tritanium tax goes too far""jj: ""well i think your two cent tritanium tax doesn't go too far enough""jj: ""doesn't matter, 9 of us are getting free holidays, just make sure you pander to enough bitter old veterans on shc and you're golden.""jj: ""i'm getting a sex change. have you seen how they flock around females like flies round dog puddings on there?"""
5/5/2010,"i got no-one above 50% the first time and had to change my answers twice to get someone up to 67%.you all suck ;dit did correctly guess who were my top candidates (i had already decided based on threads alone), so it was able to figure out who i disagreed with the least, which is neat."
5/5/2010,well instead of me being on there looks like i am kinda the middle of the road anyway lol x
5/5/2010,"yeah, i didn't like that bit either but most others were even worse so eh... i can tolerate disagreeing with one thing i guess."
5/5/2010,"just like last year an excellent tool which i will probably be using to narrow my view on the candidates.i do have one request thought when it comes down to comparison. for example the candidates can give weight to the questions they find important. i would like to see that as the person comparing you would be able to tick (per example 3) boxes to give weight to the most important statements to you, which are then giving more weight in the comparison."
5/5/2010,"not gonna use the % thing, but definitely helped me make up my mind. :)"
5/5/2010,"interesting for sure. here were mine:teadaze (83%) helen highwater (75%) fatmarrow (73%) mynxee (70%) avalloc (69%) issler dainze (68%) ankhesentapemkah (68%) dierdra vaal (68%) lycanthis (67%) centurax (67%) mazzilliu (67%) 900v (67%) illectroculus defined (66%) corbeau lenoir (65%) sokratesz (65%) meissa anunthiel (65%) alpha12125 (64%) t'amber (64%) korvin (64%) elvenlord (64%) paritybit (64%) extreme (63%) axexut (63%) ashina sito (62%) chip mintago (62%) omber zombie (61%) katabrok first (61%) darius johnson (61%) vuk lau (61%) navy lady (61%) trebor daehdoow (61%) cinori aluben (60%) alorithe (60%) elise randolph (58%) esharan (58%) placcar (58%) scwarze (57%) institute ofwar (57%) greymouse (54%) manalapan (54%) avicenna sarfaraz (52%)i thought it was more informative just to look as the %s didn't really tell the whole story. some things i don't really care about either way (bombs in low sec, wh poss being more vulnerable), while others did matter a lot more. would be interesting if there was a way to rate ""how important is this question to you?"" in addition to the simple ++ + ? - -- system there is now. nifty tool. will cause me to look at some candidates more than i might have otherwise."
5/5/2010,cat isn't in it two questions:who the heck is illectroculus defined?and why does he match my answers?
5/5/2010,interesting. have you considered collating & publishing the views of what the voters think.
5/5/2010,"i got illectroculus as well, thanks its a helpful tool at least to see who i should look at further."
5/5/2010,"i think this is pretty accurate, i tend to agree with sok on almost everything, plus he's a caldari cap pilot like my main \o/"
5/5/2010,so that the csm candidates can directly pander to the popular views of the voters?do you think they are that corrupt that they'd simply lie to get a free holiday?yes... i think you're on to something here.
5/5/2010,teadaze 80%
5/5/2010,"extreme: 86%for all i care, i voted."
5/5/2010,oops.... that is incorrect. should be strongly disagree... i had a busy work weekend. knew that the vote match was happening but had not been contacted. my longest time in eve from this past friday to tuesday was to get the vote match password so i could input my responses. i was in a big rush to get out the door and i guess i missed that one when rechecking.since i felt the questions were a bit meh this time around i am not surprised i am landing in a meh position with the posted compatibility lists. c'est la vie.
5/5/2010,"mazzilliu (77%) mynxee (73%) sokratesz (73%) teadaze (72%)yeah, that's about what i expected. interestingly, i think mynxee and sok are better fits than mazz.-liang"
5/5/2010,"when the candidates filled out their questionnaire they had to chose 3 questions that were ""very important"" for weighting purposes. i am not sure why the users are not given the same option. they might at a later time. it would help with the odd pirate/carebear matching that this round has."
5/5/2010,"ccp should spend more time fixing old content and less time introducing new content^ stupid, not everyone works on the same things. the team fixing content isn't necessarily the one adding it."
5/5/2010,"im missing an option to flag an issue as very important/unimportant to meand i would also like to be able to compare myself with a smaller list of candidates, the guy im going to vote for has only like 53% but agrees with me in all the points that are really important to me"
5/5/2010,this is a great tool thanks for making it. i stickied this up top until the 19th of this month so that everyone will be able to use this tool.
5/5/2010,thanks but moving this out of the general discussion will mean a lot of people dont see it.
5/5/2010,"after knowing and working (within eve) alongside lyc for too many years now,i can say yes i am biased but this man works tirelessly behind the scenes for our corp and is knowledable on almost every subject within eve. he and a few others within corp are our eve wiki. he has always shown integrity in everything he has done. he would make an excellent candidate for csm. he has shown his knowledge over the years is invaluable in making decisions and also he has solid ideas on how things should be my vote will most definately be for him. btw i am his ceo so obviously i am biased s"
5/5/2010,"after having watched lycanthis almost singlehandedly manage our entire corp's infrastructure and logistics over the years, i know that there is no other person i'd rather have as a csm representative. lycanthis' dedication to the game is awe inspiring, and i know for sure he'll bring a focused, down to earth intensity to the csm.this is not the candidate to vote for if you want empty promises of 100% fixed lag and amazing flashy new ships. this is the candidate to vote for if you want genuine useful fixes to problems that are actually within ccp's power to aim at.ps lyc we want better cyno graphics and more awesome effects / ship death animations too, thanks"
5/5/2010,another friendly bump for someone i have voted for :)
5/5/2010,1st post been edited/updated
5/5/2010,"you talk of allowing pirates to use bubbles and the like in low-sec, but this has me curious. isn't one thing that a number of pirates complain about that there isn't enough incentive for players to go into low-sec? wouldn't allowing bubbles without increasing the allure of low-sec space for other players simply make it so less people fly there, and thus it becomes a loss rather than a benefit?have you any particular thoughts for how to address this?"
5/5/2010,pirates need some of these advantages as well as alliances who are involded in mercenary actions against large alliances they are paid to destroy.how many times have you had a war dec with someone and not had the ability to bubble them in low sec?the people who visit low sec learn from other players very quickly about the hazards and dangers of travel there.i do not think the dynamics of people getting to low sec and 0.0 have changed much or are ever going change much.you have the 'grown ups' pool and you have the 'kiddies pool' sooner or later regardless of the danger the new player is going to venture out there.and hopefully skill him/herself well enough to be able to handle themselves before they even attempt it.you learn by trial and error to survive out here in low sec and 0.0 space if you dont it gobbles you up like a big fish.all you need to do is learn to be smarter than the big fish until you can get to be as big as it is.
5/5/2010,"hrm. i fear i was misunderstood, and must have worded that not very clearly. what i was trying to get across was...what is there to draw anybody other than pirates to low-sec at the moment? very little, aside from thrill-seeking. this is something that both non-pirates and pirates bemoan. the former because they have no reason to step into low-sec (risk, for no reward), and the latter because it lessens their possible targets. i was curious if you had anything in mind to make low-sec more appealing to non-pirating sorts, and i ask this as (hopefully~!) one of those pirating-sorts-to-be. making low-sec more dangerous would simply make it even less populated than it is now, until the only people left there would be pirates with no targets other than eachother. anything in mind for that, or do you disagree with the idea as a whole? just checking your feelings on things, is all. =>"
5/5/2010,"ok you want to draw more people to low sec for other than obvious reasons.make the bounty system a type of ratio for people with lower sec status that are repat offenders.they keep tract of declining missions for agents so why not keep track of consecutive sec hits?where as the more numerous they are the more the bounty a player increases.and ccp foots the bill for the ratio such as 2:1,3:1,4:1 and so on for the x times the offender is a repeat on taking sec hits.this makes them valuable targets for bounty hunters which btw also needs some toys to assist them.maybe some skills that work similar to locator agents only more percise information as the skill progresses.so we have the bounty hunters helping to populate low sec.make mining in low sec more valuable than it is is another way to entice players to low sec.how about the new pi stuff maybe that can be made a worth while low sec endeavor?many ways to fix this and would be welcome to any ideas on the subject as a csm i could follow up on these idea of yours and many others."
5/5/2010,free bump - you got my vote mate
5/5/2010,i support this product and/or service.
5/5/2010,"of all the issues you plan to address what, for you, is the biggest priority?"
5/5/2010,the biggest priority for me is making eve more regional again and limiting the projected power of capital ships. so rebalancing of capital ships is on top.
5/5/2010,bump for great ideas.
5/5/2010,yay \0/cast your votes now:
5/5/2010,there better be cake if you win.
5/5/2010,still running interviews.
5/5/2010,"i can't see the picture that is attached to the f11 nav-aid proposal, is it just me?"
5/5/2010,i have added an update to clarify the intentions behind my proposal.
5/5/2010,it was showing and then it wasn't (we've had issues in the past with ccp renaming things). i'll have a look later but for now the image is also hosted at the csm minutes site
5/5/2010,shows for me atm...sweet mama!!! i have been drooling for a common destinations kind of interface for ever. looks like a good baseline to start from. will be great to see it in game... sometime after incarna.....
5/5/2010,historically the candidate at the top of the page got a boost in votes just because for some reason lots of people vote for the first option. guess who is at the top of the page this time around?
5/5/2010,let's see... vote for you or get a sexually transferred disease? the std wins...
5/5/2010,"funny that there was no whining about this the past 4 elections, but now that it's ankh at the top of the list, there are two hate threads about already, plus a whole lot of qq at scrapheap challenge."
5/5/2010,"i doubt that is the case. any normal person, even if he read and heard nothing about csm, will base there vote on character portrait, country of origin and what is written there. if soeobody does not care to read, tehy would no care to vote. if there is indeed a bunch of ******s that vote for the first candidate on the list without reading, and they do represent a significant portion of eve population, they get what they deserve."
5/5/2010,fully expected you to come in all holy complaining that you would get a free advantage
5/5/2010,any reason you have hidden your corp and alliance tags from the forums? not trying to appear as independent whilst being in a large alliance i hope.
5/5/2010,good to see you were paying attention at csm2 when this issue was raised... (it also came up in discussions at csm3)
5/5/2010,better click here
5/5/2010,"hi...would you care to further comment on your qualifications to judge and represent pvp, combat, nullsec, sov mechanics< and the fact that you feel anyone who dares question your opinion is made of sewage?in addition would you care to clarify your anti-ccp stance given the huge number of anti-eve comment you make?and finally-when you are not selected for csm will you rage-quit and return to puzzle pirates for good in order to leave your mark there?thank you for your time.lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt**edit**also would you care to comment regarding rumors circulating you are using a macro of some sort to spam mail pilots in jita and other locations within eve with your csm false agenda?"
5/5/2010,should be randomized every time the page loads tbh
5/5/2010,that's us told.
5/5/2010,"nah, vote for me instead!"
5/5/2010,sure there was whining. i've complained multiple times. it's a terrible system.
5/5/2010,because it's only you that's so blatantly clueless about aspects of the game you dont even trouble to hide your desire to ruin.
5/5/2010,"don't worry i voted for none of you 2, as i don't think you are any good for eve either of you.problem solved."
5/5/2010,"welcome to eve.where all the players love tears,but the devs love them even moar.that guy in her video has extremely awesome eyes.-t'amber"
5/5/2010,the players dont have to deal with ankhasdafsa going to their offices ccp is trolling themselves lolololol
5/5/2010,"troll this, troll that. damn girl your just obsessed with that word.maybe your csm candidate election is trolling too.oh and your moaning about how the list of candidates is presented but you have some drizzle about being a girl and also to visit your facebook page !. good effort!!"
5/5/2010,what are you talking about. the non-randomized order was complained about as soon as it went live in the first election
5/5/2010,"i personally brought the ""+1000 bonus votes"" issue to ccp's attention 2 months ago.ccp responded that this matter will be under investigation.i am glad that it is ankh this time that was placed on top rather than some other candidates.time will prove my/our case about with how many votes difference ankh will become chairman."
5/5/2010,"you could have done the same thing. an election is about gaming the process to get elected.darius johnson will win, has enough goons to vote him in just on that.t'amber has been running the soe lotto's and that developed a name within eve. they just missed making the csm4 and was an alternate.tea daze has the agony pvp angle.i could go on. i do want to say that just because people have some sort of an advantage, whatever that advantage, does not make them a bad candidate that is winning by gaming the system. in the end it is the players that make the choice to who is elected. the first in the list will result in more votes but, those votes would not catapult someone into being elected. they would still have to reach a decent number of voters on their own merit. the same as anyone else.the last election the minimum number of votes needed to get a seat on the csm was roughly 740. i placed in the middle of the pack with 350 or so votes. i doubt that by being at the top of the list i would have gained enough votes to get a seat. ironically i was actually the last on the list for csm4. i submitted 2 hours before the deadline. it took 3 weeks to get a response from ccp about a concern i had. i went for it anyway since time was running out. they got to me 3 days after the submission deadline and we dealt with the issue.in any case, there has been 4 elections so far and no one seems to have brought up this issue. there is nothing to be done about it now. if you want it changed for csm 6 fine, make it happen. otherwise, htfu."
5/5/2010,fyi darius no long runs for csm
5/5/2010,i'm curious to know just how much ankh has been playing eve for the past 6 months. she only started showing up in my addressbook noticeably since ccp announced they were abolishing term limits. in other words when she knew she could/would run for csm again.
5/5/2010,it does feel like she is just back for the csm. i mean if you are serious about puzzle pirates it doesn't leave much time for any other games.......issler
5/5/2010,"since i am a bit daft and had no idea on who to vote, i just voted for ankh since she was at the top of the page ...what can i say, some of us are slower than others"
5/5/2010,"i, too, saw the shiny avatar yelling internet-girl-id-like-to-**** exploding on my screen when i pressed the vote button.but then i remembered i hated her socks of and tasted a little sick in my mouth."
5/5/2010,"as a former corp mate of ankh, i can safely say that in the last six months she has moved some pos fuel and *****ed about eve being a pos. apart from that her contribution to corp operations and activities was nonexistent. she was not involved in a single alliance operation even as providence was burning. i find her claims of having ""experienced"" 0.0 during her time with cva to be wonderfully ironic."
5/5/2010,"it's impossible to know what specific game mechanic changes are feasible without knowing the code, but i am pretty sure that whatever change does eventually get settled on will include some sort visibility reduction.in other words, right now, you see everything on grid. you have a ""god's eye view"" of the situation. this makes it much easier to organize and coordinate large blobs.if, on the other hand, the more ships you brought to the fight, the more your ability to get a good idea of what is really going on degraded, the value of an extra ship would be reduced, and the value of good leadership (especially the ability of multiple smaller groups to cooperate) would be enhanced. there'd be more chaos, more fog-of-war, and potentially more fun.done right, fleet fights would tend to normalize at the size where the current server infrastructure can handle things without too much lag.the problem with such changes is that they are a huge risk. ccp obviously doesn't want to break the game, and the law of unintended consequences applies to eve more than any other game i know of.the upside of going with a fog-of-war approach to fixing lag is that potential fixes can initially be tested by installing a perceptual filter into the client. it would be relatively easy (and require no server changes!) to temporarily change the client so, for example, you only can see the closest 50 ships, even if the server is still sending all the data to you.then, when you find a set of gameplay changes that have the desired effects, they can be migrated to the server to capture any addition i/o and compute savings they generate.personally, i think it would be great fun if a ""subspace storm"" swept through new eden over a period of months, causing various changes to the visibility rules. it would probably spark a lot of conflict as the various alliances tried to take advantage of the changed conditions and ""game"" the rules being tested.this issue is one of the reasons i'm running for csm, btw."
5/5/2010,"since everyone else was doing it, i thought i'd make a csm campaign video as well. it took me a while, mostly because i have never produced videos before. i hope you guys find it funny"
5/5/2010,awesome..
5/5/2010,"nice can i have your stuff,,,,, opps wrong post lol"
5/5/2010,good grief and ur a example of the csm

5/5/2010,look at me look at me i want attention
5/5/2010,well tbh - a lot more professional and a better sell
5/5/2010,i would.
5/5/2010,"well its all down to whether you take the csm seriously. if you do - the the ankhaphatmawhitbread video is superior. if you dont, then the mazz video will probably tickle your fancy.a quick look at the outstanding issues the csm have given to ccp on their collosal (an i mean collosal) to do list would probably lead one to not take it serioulsy.skunk"
5/5/2010,i have to say... it is really good
5/5/2010,"chuckle, +1 vote from me cause that was funny and if its not funny, its not worth my vote."

5/5/2010,i'd go for a slightly dorky chick rather than a politician any dayaaaaargh! stop moving the camera all the time. it's not cops!
5/5/2010,"rawr! cat-fight!how about you both slip into something less and have at it? i'd vote, then."
5/5/2010,moved from general discussion. all campaigning should remain in the jita park speakers corner forum.
5/5/2010,"thanks to this thread, i have made my mind up....nice video ankhesentapemkah.. and you have my votes"
5/5/2010,can i vote for the guy in the car? he's the only person (in either video) who isn't **** poor on camera.
5/5/2010,thanks for setting this up again
5/5/2010,"thanks much dv, this is an awesome tool. it's interesting to compare how close the positions of so many of us candidates are based on our answers and ""important"" questions. was it similar for csm 4? i can't remember."
5/5/2010,"no. positions were more spread out last time around. not by too much though. this time there is no hot button ""nurf x"" type of threads about. those help to spread the numbers a bit. additionally a few of the questions were a bit of a no brainer answer. everyone is really going to give a thumbs up to a ""ui"" patch but it is something that ccp can/will never do (at least in one go as the question states). kinda makes the question pointless and waters down the matching process. add to that there is the ""fix bug's over adding new content"" question which is basically the same thing, just about everyone will agree and ccp won't/can't do. the end result is a bit more muddled result this time around.funny note, you (mynxee) and ankhesentapemkah landed within 6% of each other when i did the vote match survey. it's really kinda funny since your one of the c&p's ""anit-ankh"" candidates. guess pirates are really carebears at heart... or are carebears really pirates??? (edit: reread after posting and saw that my post sounded dismissive of the vote-match service. i did not intend that. i think this is a good thing for the csm election. it is just that this time the questions are not as well selected to truly differentiate the candidates. so while it narrows the field a bit the user has to do more research on which candidate is best for them this time. quite honestly that is not such a bad thing.)"
5/5/2010,thank you very much for doing this again!
5/5/2010,"nicely done, thanks."
5/5/2010,"perhaps it needs a few more divisive questions. all things considered, mynxee is pretty reasonable, and there weren't questions like ""should all low and null sec space be changed to 1.0 security?"" and ""should people who pod be banned from the game?"""

5/5/2010,oooops!
5/5/2010,"a mishap of some sort, i take it? *click*-- shadow"
5/5/2010,"does anyone out there have a compiled list of ui fixes we want to see? everyone is screaming, ""fix the ui"". it seems a logical task of the csm to compile a list of specific fixes we want to see. preferably one broken down by both implementation difficulty and priority.here's some quick suggestions:- allow items in 'people and places' to be moved by dragging into open folders (onto items within those folders) rather than having to be dragged onto the folder bar itself. (implementation: should be trivial)- include thousands separators in contracts for large numbers of items. this changes ""500000 zydrine"" into ""500,000 zydirne"". not only is that much easier to read, it will also cut down scammers who advertise the contract as being for 5 million zydrine. (implementation: should be trivial)- make bpc icons different from bpo icons (implementation: hard / very hard, priority ?)and so on.handing a nice long list of specific fixes to ccp is more likely to get them accomplished. at least the ones that are simple to implement. of course, compiling and maintaining said list is no small task. but csm volunteers are all eager to take up such useful tasks to benefit our community, right?"
5/5/2010,"if someone would bother reading assembly hall, finding a thread like this would not be hard. for all those candidates that cannot be bothere to open assembly hall:linkagethere where hundreds of other suggestions, some brilliant, some not so brilliant, that sank under piles of garbage like ""let's ban everyone from pandemic legion!"" and etc. i tried to compile the ones i could find.feel free to add whatever is needed. and ccp has stated they cannot give bpc's and bpos different icons for technical reasons.as an option, ofcource ccp can rework the whole thing from ground-up, creating something completely new and neat."
5/5/2010,hey guys.my agenda is quite specifically inclusive of almost all these issues. although i haven't compiled a list with all of the suggestions from the assembly hall i have most of them noted and and infact a large amount have been posted or supported by me over the years. :)feel free to convo me anytime i'm around.-t'amber
5/5/2010,"since csm can't bring up issues that have already been presented to ccp at a summit, it makes sense to look at evelopedia to figure out which assembly hall proposals are duplicates. information about what ui fixes are in the backlog and how they are currently prioritized is something i plan to request a discussion session for in iceland if elected. it would be useful to correlate that data with issues raised by csm and proposed in ah so that redundant effort can be minimized. how much info ccp will share and whether cam will be allowed to share it with the community at a meaningful level of detail remains to be seen."
5/5/2010,any reason why dj is not on the list of candidates you can vote for?

5/6/2010,"not much time so will make this quick:1) em/exp resist nerf: this resulted in a 18% increase in dmg for scorch and 12%increase for mf. (these numbers are rough..its 18.4ish% and 11.5ish. dont have a calculator atm so did it in my head)2) for some reason a dmg increase sticks out in my head for large lasers...but i may be remembering an effective dmg increase from tracking given fits/fights at the time. its been a few years since i thought about it 3)check patch notes for dominion. tracking was increased for arty to get the variation between tiers correct. this is why i said ""projectile"". i agree with: 1)the playstyle inherrent in blaster boats is largely out of fashion, or as you say ""weak"". blanket boosting tracking and/or dmg wont make it a stonger playstyle unles you overbuff...which would just be breaking everything else.but...""better/stronger/more popular"" playstyles were boosted in dmg and tracking...which just serves to make a sub-par style even more worthless. giving hybrids a boost can at least return some of the ground lost.this doesnt mean that ships cant be modified if a boost occurs. the tracking bonus on mega/ranis could be removed if a general tracking buff was implemented for example. or removing turret slots from drone boats, or.... you get the idea.edit:added last paragraph"
5/6/2010,"this assumes that you're always shooting at armor and that you have no drones.for instance, lets look at a harbinger shooting at a brutix that only has a dcii for a tank. before the change the brutix had roughly 34,600 ehp against a harb with scorch loaded. after, 32,980. a difference of 4.91%this damage advantage clearly goes up when the % of hit points in armor goes up(for whatever reason), but its never so pronounced as the simple ""vs armor"" numbers would suggest.no such analysis was done, and if it were it would be very suspect. see, that is the thing. it would not return some of the ""ground lost"". the boosts did not make them gain any real ground in terms of what was best. you still don't have a reason to choose blaster boats.this is why i said that if you completely undid the laser and ac changes it would not change peoples preference for lasers or acs over blasters."
5/6/2010,"on the first point i cannot check your numbers because i do not have an old version of eft handy and i do not have the inclination at the moment to work it out by hand. however, assuming that your numbers are correct it only stands to reason that shooting any ship that has a bulk of its hp in structure/shield with a dcu ii would see less % benefit given the 60% resist of a dcu ii and the fact that base em shield resist was not changed. thus why a gank brutix and/or only fitting a dcu sees a smaller net change, and why when you fit plates the numbers scew back towards the 18/12%figure. a harbinger shooting another harbinger would see a larger % gain by comparison... unless cookie cutter fitting is lse's on harbs now. with that said emp/fusion/hail/barrage/etc... got a boost during that resist nerf by virtue of it hitting armor and/or shields harder (no change on the structure buffer tanks though). then things got boosted for projectiles just recently.re: your objection to the lost ground argument: if you argue that boosting blasters dmg and/or tracking will not change the fact that we will have no reason to chose them over ac's or pulse,then there is little reason to object to a boost in the first place. you can be confident that such a boost, even a large one, is absolutely worthless in terms of what is ""best"".now if you argue that such changes (large boosts for example)would be detrimental then suddenly blasters are ""best"" at something.... and considerably enough better than anyother option that they break eve. this is what you have said in earlier posts.can you please clarify your argument for me? i find it unclear."
5/6/2010,"there is so much eft bulls**t here, i have nothing left to puke with, but my own intestents."
5/6/2010,"i did it with the current. its why i only used the dc. 1 tech 1 adaptive magnetic plating with 0 compensation skills = 50->60% em resists on armor. damage control's resists are not stacking penalized and so the base works when its activated.if we go to 3 trimarks, dc and 1600mm plate the difference becomes 56,166 ehp after, 60,954 before. a difference of 8.5% for scorch. less for am. now i am sure we can break 10% if we consider big active tanks or zealots(shooting at big armor tanks). but in the end its not that significant.doesn't mean i agreed with the change, quite the opposite. the point was that we weren't talking a move to domination due to it. especially since the strength of other damage types in those situations was still quite strong relatively. they're not that uncommon.small amounts, to the effect to correct for the ac/laser boosts it won't have much of an effect. that doesn't mean it won't be possible to boost blasters to have an effect. but consider either of those two scenarios. if you boost them a small amount and they're still terrible... nothing changes except the already good vigilant, daredevil, and taranis do more dps. but now you still need more changes to blasters. so the whines will continue. if you boost them a lot then you will overboost things and move things out of whack and then you will get whines from laser users or ac users.and that is what is being asked for here. either a boost to damage or a boost to range. a boost to damage can have significant consequences for ships that don't have as many issues. a boost to range would be paradigm breaking.an example of what i am attempting to describe might be this. imagine that a strength of 6 is the ""proper strength for a ship"" and there are 5 ships that use the weapons ranging from strength from 1 to 5. if you boost the system such that the ships in the middle (str 3) hit the proper strength then you have a set of ships from 4 to 8. two of which are still underpowered, one of which is just right and 2 of which are now overboosted.rather than do that, its better to evaluate each ship individually and ask why its not performing and what it needs to perform without breaking the paradigms. the answer imo is pretty clearly that the thorax and hyperion need speed and agility and that the brutix needs to be brought in line with the tier 2 bc's. but that is not what is requested, so i cannot give my support and will continue to argue against such changes."
5/6/2010,"it is much easier to boost hybrids then cut back those ships which become ops(note that ccp didnt do this to laser/projectile ships which are op atm). currently 90% of hybrid ships are lacking efficiency and half of them are completly useless.if ccp fix them one by one it is fine with me ,but i cant see how that would happen ,if i look at how they balanced in the past."
5/6/2010,"awww boohoo, maybe you should find an effective way to use the ships with hybrid guns then maybe?.it's not all about dps dude."
5/6/2010,"well, i can argue with you here, blasters are all about dps. but since i'm really bored i'll add this, log into eve and play it a bit, for once. really, buy a ship, like a cruiser (i'd prefer if it was fitted with blasters, but ev'rything will do in your case, just leave your 50 friends and an fc behind), go for a roam. i mean undock, set your autopilot to 0.4-0.0, set security pentalty to 100, throw a dart on the map and go.if you do that, i'll proudly become the first person on the eve-online forums that will actually care about what you have to say."
5/6/2010,"well i can agree that blasters is mostly about dps. but blasters already have quite alot of dps. so it's fine as it is.but i was more thinking on railguns that the dps isn't all there. because if dps have been all in fleet fights, then my 1400mm tempest would suck badly. but it doesn't. the tempest is pretty nice in fleet fights.and rokh and mega with railguns works good in their ways to."
5/6/2010,"i'm impressed. restraint, not feeding the troll. anyways, what you have said is the problem we have here. you and goumindong (he never touched a blaster in his life, so i'm more than happy to ignore whatever he has to say) only think in 0.0 fleet battle terms, not what happens on the daily basis to people using blasters in their t1 frigates, cruisers and battlecruisers. right now flying blaster boats consists of (hopefully) ramming your target and trying not to overshoot, overloading ev'rything and trying to kill your target before it moves too far away.not trying to sound like an elitist pvper here, but most of the time all it takes is to click to the right or left as the opponent and you start the fight at 10km, blasters don't do nearly enough damage even if you'll manage to get into range to make up for that.imho what is needed here is redution of mass to some blaster boats, or 'least try it out on sisi. again, i'm not an expert on ship balance, but it doesn't seem reasonable that ship with lowest range are also one of the slowest."
5/6/2010,"to the first thing. yes, blasters is very close range weapons, and you just have to live with it. it's how they work. it's like we who use autocannons are in 80% of all times in falloff range and have to live with way lower dps than the eft shows they have.simply because when you goes into falloff, you lose dps. and even then, it's working pretty good that way for autocannons.it's just the way how you use the ships with autocannons.but to the blasters again. they do poor damage at more ranges, but the thing is to get inside optimal on your guns fastest possible. once that happens, you can do insane amount of dps. ofc, if you decide to move 15 km to get inside optimal on your blasters on the target, then it can hurt a bit if you get shoot before you are in optimal.but in most cases, the dps the blasters have does so much dps that they do so much damage that they can manage to kill the target before you die then. even if you had to move 15 km.so it's all about taking risks. like an abaddon pilot is doing against an ac tempest with dual heavy neuts orbitin the abaddon at 1 km. because the abaddon wont hit that tempest any good and the tempest will tank the abaddon because if the tempest is fitted right, it will have a bit high em and thermal resists.or like having a neutron mega inside 5 km on your tempest. that's not fun i can tell you.so it's not only blaster pilots who have to take risks to get something killed.and no, lowering the mass on some blaster boats is not the right way to go."
5/6/2010,"supported. tracking speed should be inversely proportional to intended effective range of turret. other hybrid disadvantages compared to autocannons in small gang/solo warfare.1. can't switch damage types. hybrids are useless against t2 caldari/gallente hulls, but projectiles are effective against all t2 ships since they can switch to damage resistance hole.2. hybrids use cap. energy nuetralizer means game over for any gallente blaster boat. auto cannons will still deal damage."
5/6/2010,this is a good example on someone who doesn't understand the advantages and downsides every of the weapon types have and then don't understands the balance between them.
5/6/2010,what exactly is the downside of an auto-cannon compared to a blaster again?
5/6/2010,fighting in falloff and lose quite alot of dps?. and on top of it doesn't have quite alot of dps to begin with.
5/6/2010,fighting in falloff is an advantage since the blaster can't hit it. surely there must be some other reason.
5/6/2010,blasters are the shortest ranged weapons on the slowest ships. acs are on the fastest ships and have longer range. pulse have fairly insane range and only a slight decrease in damage compared to blasters and ac on ships that are faster and have more armor than blaster boats. please explain how this is balanced.
5/6/2010,dont forget torps with insane dps insane range and nice platforms
5/6/2010,"yeah, and then the blaster mega have the advantage again that if he scramble your tempest and web you and keeps you in his optimal once he's there, then the blaster pilot have a big advantage to, right?.each weapon types have advantages over other weapon types that is weak in something, like autocannons can keep hitting in deep falloff while the blasters can't really hit you. but if you look the other way. if the blaster mega can keep you scrambled and webbed inside 5 km, your in trouble.see where i'm going?."
5/6/2010,"as long as you can wait ~10 seconds for your torps to land. most close range ships will have fired their second or third shot by then. torps work best at extremely close range, where other ships have tracking problems but missiles do not.except that requires the use of two mid-slots, and assumes the minmatar ship doesn't also have scram+web, and requires the gallente ship to magically be fast enough to catch the minmatar ship and keep it within range."
5/6/2010,"lets take the blaster mega vs the ac tempest here again.a smart blaster mega pilot fit warp scramblers instead of warp disruptors. but a tempest pilot doesn't fit a scrambler, but a disruptor.so what does this ends up with?, yes, the blaster mega can keep you scrambled (keep your mwd disabled) while the tempest only have the mega disrupted. so it means that the tempest can't use the mwd to get out. but the blaster mega can use the mwd to get back into optimal of the tempest if he wants. so it means that the tempest is dead meat if that happens.so it's all about not being inside web / scram range of the mega in a tempest. and that's gonna be as much of an issue as a mega have to get into web / scram range to the tempest.ofc, if you jump into a system and lands 20 km from a mega, it shouldn't be an issue for the tempest. but if a mega warps right on top of your ass, you might be in trouble if your in a tempest and gets scrambled and webbed by that mega.but if that mega had been an abaddon for example, then the tempest would never move away from the abaddon if you want to fight the abaddon. the tempest will then mwd as fastest possible really close to the abaddon and orbit it at 1 km and then shoot him.do you understand now what i'm trying to tell here?. it's just a basic understanding on how each ships and weapons works."
5/6/2010,"i'm coming at if from a smaller ship perspective where time to get out of web/scram range is much less. in vast majority of the cases, the auto-cannon fitted ship will get outside web/scram range and then kite the blaster fitted ship to its death (the minmatar ship is faster, has as many if not more mid slots for webs/scrams, etc..)."
5/6/2010,"you also haven't read what i've written have you? the problem with blasters is, explicitly, that they cannot be solo/small gang platforms if they don't have the speed and agility to perform tackling duties and still get damage done.there are only two blaster boats in the entire game that are slower than their pulse laser equivalent. that is the taranis compared to the crusader and the thorax compared to the omen. few would claim the omen is superior to the thorax and the taranis is not considered a deficient ship. the deimos is faster than the zealot[1657(d) vs 1406(z)], the hyperion is faster and more agile than any amarr battleship, and the brutix is effectively the same speed as the harbinger.some of them might not be fast, or agile enough, but that does not change their actual relative speeds. you ought to respect that when doing your analysis or people won't take you seriously, kinda like when you say that resist bonuses are not as good as repair bonuses(srsly, still waiting for the logic on that one)"
5/6/2010,"i see what you mean, but that's minmatars job to kite.amarr's job is to always keep range. while gallente's job is always to get closest possible fastest possible. and caldari's job with missiles is something totally different again than the other 3 races have."
5/6/2010,"suportedwhy do you suppose 1on1 mega vs tempest?you said mega is more dangerous than abaddon to your tempest.that's true because damage typein other case..how do you think about meet t2 ship or shield tank ship.in this case, tempest is more useful by choosing damage type.yes.. ac's strength is damage type ,and also blaster's strength is only dpsbut, everybody know that blaster just has a little bit moreyes so, dps must be boosted , and also tracking too"
5/6/2010,"liberal sparrow, it was an example to show why blasters are fine and why autocannons are fine in their way.and those things with blasters and autocannons will still be valid if we are talking 5 vs 5 or 20 vs 20.you still have to get close to your targets in your mega's fastest possible while the tempest have to kite other ships that it should avoid to get to close to. but still be within rr range to the others in your gang as much as you can.edit: you said that blasters just have a little more dps than other weapon types. on paper yes, but try to include resists into it all and don't just look at the eft dps, and you will see that a 2x damage mod neutron mega does like 5-6% more dps than a 3x damage mod abaddon after resists on a target that is armor tanked for example if the abaddon use 7x pulses and one rr.well to make it clear. you all are supporting this topic only because you mean blaster ships is to hard to use and then want blasters boosted so your life in eve can be easier.like our lifes with autocannons and minmatar ships is any easier than blasters and gallente ships is now."
5/6/2010,"fixed it for you. a tempest would likely have neuts as well, so a blasterthron best kill it quick before it has 0 cap (doesn't take long). so, no, a rationally fit ac tempest would laugh in the face of a megathron. you don't fly a pvp ship solo without scram and/or nuet and expect to survive against another pvp ship. but, this is 1v1 with pvp ships (which rarely happens). in a gang or fleet, blaster boats are useless. shooting a miner or ratter can be done as easily in a dustbin with a staple gun as anything else, not a rational niche for a ship if it can be done by any properly fit ship."
5/6/2010,"bagehi, don't be stupid. do you know the reason why tempest pilots doesn't fit a scrambler?, because most of the time, you have to keep distance. and with distance, you can't keep the targets scrambled. and if you can't keep them scrambled then, they just warps away then.and if you have to get close to an abaddon or geddon, it doesn't matter if you have scrambler or a disruptor fitted then, because they aren't going anywhere as long they don't fit scramblers then. but what is the odds to find an abaddon or geddon with warp scrambler fitted?. tiny i will say.yeah the tempest will most likely have dual heavy neuts fitted or one heavy neut and one rr, but what does those neuts really means to a gang that is full of passive tanked ships that just gets repped by others in the gang?.it doesn't helps that much there.yes against an active tanked ship or smaller targets, the dual heavy neuts will help alot against that in most cases."
5/6/2010,blasters cannot do their job even if they get closest as fast as possible because they can't apply enough effective damage when at optimal because tracking sucks at very close range. therefore better tracking proposed. qed.
5/6/2010,"if you just sit still and just shoots, then yeah, i see what you mean. but at least use your brain and move around to try and get the transversal down as much as you can.trust me, it helps alot to move around as much as you can."
5/6/2010,"the tempest will die long before the blaster ship is capped out(if the hyp is in close) this holds true even for a half and half hyperion that is running its rep the entire time, let alone a blaster ship that doesn't have one.neuts are less about dealing with ships the same size as you, and more about having an option to stop ships that are smaller than you.if the blaster ship isn't doing much damage, then neither is the other ship to the blaster boat. this can best be seen with the mega and hype. the mega has a tracking bonus and so has the best relative tracking of any bs in the game. this means that if its missing, so is the other guy, except the other guy is missing harder.the hype has the space to fit 2 webs. this gives it even better real tracking than the megathron which has the best raw tracking of any battleship in the game."
5/6/2010,sounds good in theory... doesn't work so well in practice. how about just having a blaster have an equal chance at hitting the same target at its intended range as an autocannon does as its intended range? that's it. not asking for more damage/volley. not asking for more dps. not asking for increased optimal. not asking for increased falloff. not asking for omni-damage ammo. not asking for less cap usage. just asking for equivalent functional tracking ability.
5/6/2010,"theory is practice in eve. unless you're claiming that there is some bug that is messing up the tracking formula for blasters, claims that you are not hitting as well as others are simply not true.alright, so lets reduce the tracking of blasters..."
5/6/2010,no other t1 or t2 gallente ship has a tracking bonus with the exception of the tristan (and it's a split weapons platform making the bonus only partially applicable). is your proposed solution to add a tracking bonus to all gallente turret boats?
5/6/2010,so neither ship can hit in the blaster ship's intended range. only the autocannon can hit in the autocannon's intended range. see a problem here? and intended range does not equal optimal range.
5/6/2010,"hehe i have more kills with eagle only as kills he has :phe must have awesome experience from ingame. same applies to nightmarix.and they want to say us how good blasters are, they only see those on market or in eft."
5/6/2010,"and the taranis. that would leave the thorax and brutix without tracking bonuses(deimos/astarte have a falloff bonus). but they really don't have tracking problems.it seems that you did not get the irony in your comment. so let me explain it to you.1) at the optimal range of ac's they have worse relative tracking than the blasters optimal range. granted, looking at a ships tracking relative to optimal range is pretty dumb. really all you care about is its tracking ""whatever range you're at now"". which means that blasters track just as well or better than acs.2) you specified ""hit chance"" at ""intended range"". this is funny because the ""intented range"" of acs is in falloff, which lowers hit chance. such to equalize ""hit chance"" at each ships ""intended range"" you would have to reduce the tracking of blasters since blasters hit more often at their intended range than ac's do at theirs.____of course both of those are pretty funny because they both subscribe to the fallacy that two ships can be different distances away from each other. but hey, its the fallacy that you used. so its the fallacy that i am perfectly happy to laugh at you for.this is not the first time the same pointless allegation has come up. you are describing situations that cannot happen unless you are deficient as a pilot, ship fitter, or a bug exists. that ain't my fault."
5/6/2010,offhand... light nuetron blaster ii: 0.3165 rad/secheavy nuetron blaster ii: 0.1 rad/seclight 200mm autocannon ii: 0.315 rad/secheavy 425mm autocannon ii: 0.1056 rad/secfunctionally the same tracking. done with your trolling.
5/6/2010,"yes. that was the point. you see, you complained about the relative hit chance at ""intended range"". the relative hit hit chance is a function of both the intended range and the tracking. since the intended range for ac's is in falloff, that has an effect on the hit chance of the weapon. even at 0 transversal, ac ships will be missing at their intended range.i was pointing out that your evaluation was ridiculous. blasters clearly track just as well as ac's, pulse lasers clearly track worse. range only has a function when you're describing the optimal range characteristics of the weapon, which is a separate issue all together.if blasters have good tracking then they have good tracking, end of story.edit: i have just about gotten you to water, lets see if you'll drink."
5/6/2010,"is this a way to show that you don't know much about how the weapons works at all?oh, and there isn't anything called: heavy 425mm autocannon ii or light 200mm autocannon ii fyi.sorry to say it, but i have a very bad feeling that there are many players here in this topic that just screams boost blasters without even understanding how blasters, autocannons, pulses or torps works at all."
5/6/2010,the numbers are accurate even if the name is wrong; you agree?
5/6/2010,"now, look at the optimal range of the blasters, and then look at the optimal of the autocannons.is that a good enough hint for you to realize that the ranges have alot to say on how your hit chance is?. lol, looking at the tracking number only is going to make you look funny and dumb.like 800mm ac gun with emp l. it have 3 km optimal with 0.054 tracking, while neutron blaster cannon ii with antimatter l have 4.5 km optimal range and 0.05412 tracking.when the 800mm ac guns gets to 4.5 km where the neutron blasters have it's optimal range, then the neutron blaster cannon ii have more tracking / hit chance than the 800mm ac gun, since the 800mm ac guns are then in falloff at 4.5 km. and falloff reduces your hit chance.and then look at mega pulse laser ii with multifrequency l. it have 15 km optimal range and 0.04219 tracking. and guess what?. at 15 km, the mega pulse laser ii have waaaaay way more tracking / hit chance than 800mm ac guns would ever dream of at 15 km.the tracking and ranges on those guns with the stats i have is taken from ships with no tracking or range bonuses.now put the neutron blaster cannon ii on a megathron and you will get 0.07442 in tracking with antimatter l. and that is quite alot more tracking than a tempest have with 800mm ac guns with emp l, even more tracking that a tempest with dual 425mm ac guns with emp l have to.and this is somerhing you didn't understand?."
5/6/2010,"hit chance, not tracking. different things."
5/6/2010,"yeah, i fixed it in my post."

5/6/2010,"i'm taking this approach:i need a t1 battleship with t2 fitting that can perform really well in small gang roaming pvp. having level 5 skills in all battleships and having fought 3000~ battles, i have a pretty good ""feel"" for what works and what doesn't.right now, i feel that my best options for close range pvp battleship are the dominix, typhoon, and tempest. megathron would be pretty down on my list, below rokh, geddon, and abaddonthat said, megathron used to be my 2nd favorite ship - like 3 years ago.the main issue with megathron, and i suppose with blasters in general - fitting requirements are too harsh.the damage advantage of blasters is completely insignificant in light of all the other variables that need to be considered. ideally, i want to think that blasters are kings of close range pvp. but that's simply not true.i give up on blasters, except when i decide to fit some electrons on dominix - as something extra. i adapted by using other ships.i don't believe there can be any meaningful progress regarding blaster issue while ccp designer suffer from ""damage phobia"" illness. i don't think they have even acknowledged that they have this problem. it's much easier for playerbase to find work around this issue."

5/6/2010,"yesterday i had to change e-mail address, since i somehow managed to get a virus that stole all of my contacts in my mail, so now the old e-mail address is being used by some spammers to send out spam mails with my e-mail address, and then sends it out to all of my contacts.but the thing i saw when i changed my e-mail to some sites that had my old e-mail address was that when i changed the e-mail address to the new one, then some of the sites sent out an e-mail to the old e-mail address i had that my e-mail was changed to the new one.and some few of those sites who did it even sent out an e-mail with an activation link to the old e-mail address so you could re-activate the account you have on those sites with the new e-mail.so in this case, you can't just change out the e-mail and then use it with your new e-mail address before you have re-activated your account with the new e-mail address from your old e-mail address.and do you know why they do it?, yes, it's because of security. ding ding ccp, time to wake up on this.and this is something i want to see here in eve to.and ofc that we can have the option to lock down the character for being used or being sold. ofc, you need to have the option to choose how long time the character / accounts should be locked down. so if you know you wont have the chance to log into eve for like 6 months, then you can just use the lockdown option and lock the character / account down for 6 months just to be sure nothing can happen to the characters / accounts in the meantime.everything that makes the security better for our characters / accounts is always something i'm gonna support.so this is 100% fully supported by me."
5/6/2010,a simple but effective idea..
5/6/2010,not too sure what you mean by that? i was under the impression that it simply sends the character to a different account (name). hence the personality would be different but the name remains the same (and keeps it's past history)?
5/6/2010,"yeah, but you (the player) can get a different name under which to do business. for most purposes, that's enough."
5/6/2010,"that's metagaming. this proposal suggest possible ideas to completely avoid that. given that players can already have unlimited accounts, trade characters and delete characters, there are already far worse avenues than a name change."
5/6/2010,"i'd support it in principle, but i think a reasonable grace period is warranted. training expires after a couple of days.why not make this a 30 day grace period. i like to be able to go on holidays and know that my market orders are still there. if my account expires while i'm away for a week or two, it would be nice to pick it up again with my market orders and datacores ticking over. rl people regularly go on holiday for a couple of weeks and their businesses/jobs continue to operate for a reasonable period. not everyone closes down their business for a 2 or 3 week holiday. coming back to billions of isk after 6 or 12 months is a bit much if you're not paying your subscription."
5/6/2010,"""pvpers decide to spend the couple of months training to do r&d"" doesn't compute. most pvpers will not spend a couple of months training a pve skills unless they already have all the pvp skills in several races. seeing the average lifespan of a eve character i doubt that there will be a lot of people entering datacore production. so t2 prices will go up a bit, but not much as currently there is a oversupply of inventors. for datacore production a few days after account expiry would be reasonable. for market orders there is no reason at all to discount them if the character is inactive. they are already penalized by the character not being active and following the market and they have a natural expiry date. already voted for the removal of datacore ghost farming. i am against the removal of buy/sell orders from inactive accounts."

5/6/2010,"a stated aim of ccp with the dominion changes was to lure people to 0.0. it might seem strange that someone from a pvp alliance is looking to get miners into 0.0, but it's about population growth and miners who come to 0.0 will also learn some pvp, so it's good for everyone. the industrial index, which is what is needed for certain exploration sites, requires miners to maintain it. miners need a place to refine their ore. with the current system, minmatar outposts have a clear advantage over the other outposts to lure miners. i.e. they can achieve a 100% refine with a little effort, and start out with a refinery  albeit a rather poor yielding one, even before upgrades.this proposal isnt about nerfing the minmatar outpost, or taking its advantage away, but it is about bringing the other outposts up to some level of refining ability so that they are viable for miners. the sole reason for these upgrades is to lure miners to nullsec. un-protected miners = dead miners i.e. miners that will soon learn to bring protection, while miners who bring a protective detail means profits for them and pew-pew for the rest of us (frankly ganking miners is no fun, but fighting their security team is). so without further ado, heres what im proposing:upgrade the minmatar outposts base yield to 35% and reduce the upgrade bonus to 5% per level. this still caps it out at 50% for level 3 upgrade, but will provide an instant boost to the outposts out there with level 1 or level 2 upgrades (or even those without upgrades for that matter).upgrade all other outposts to a 10% base yield to provide the most basic of refining (a max skill pilot would get a bit over 60% without an implant  slightly better with the implant but still less than two thirds). leave the upgrade bonus at 10% per level for these outposts, meaning the other outpost can achieve a 40% base yield, but at considerable expense. a 20% or 30% base yield would be achievable in any outpost with a level 1 or 2 upgrade.this provides some incentive for miners to do their thing and will allow manufacturers access to more minerals in 0.0. overall this makes things more self sufficient for an alliance in 0.0, without making it too easy.ive linked a spreadsheet showing that a 100% yield would be possible in a non-minmatar outpost, but would require considerable training. the minmatar outpost maintains its supremacy, as pilots would need less training to achieve good yields at these outposts, while other outposts have at least a reasonable prospect of attracting miners. changing the values in the green boxes will show how different skills can achieve different yields in the different outposts."
5/6/2010,"the reason ppl arnt in null is because of the image people get,when you say nullsec to any highsec player they thinkima get blobedima get gatecampedpeople will ransom me then kill me anywaysall the things i wanna do are avalible in highsec or wormhole space, so why go to 0.0make a new mineral that only spawns in ores from 0.0 and low sec = more people go... that is all"
5/6/2010,"protected miners = dead miners.for normal mining op you will only bring 1 or 2 ships for protection (bit more if you are only doing it as cover to bait a cloaker). one to tank npc spawns, and maybe a zealot or something to pop the random sb or advanced tackler. besides that your protection consists of warping to a pos in time, since hulks are way too flimsy to be anywhere near a fight, even if they got 200 snipers protecting them. not to mention it would be way expensive to have a serious protection team with miners."
5/6/2010,"although i like the solution, it's not addressing the primary issue. null sec mining in most cases is a very very high risk proposition from a miners perspective and it really has little to do with outpost / pos refining rates as it does with survivability.null sec mining only has a proportionate risk / reward equation under the following circumstances (a) youve got a security team parked on the hulks, usually you need a security team big enough to scare away anyone dumb enough try and pop a hulk, expensive and difficult to organize; (b) youve already got a system that has sufficient mining level and deep in null sec space that sees little traffic.hulks need a buff to surviablity / escapability, better yet  start talking a t3 ships mining exhumer because the drop in null sec mineral ore prices doesnt make providing security viable anymore. i would be the first in line to pay 600m to 800m for something that didnt make me feel like a giant bulleye. as someone whos his share of hulks in null sec, give me a chance to atleast make a break for it. id be interested to see how that balances out against the meta 0 nerf in a couple weeks. as long as a hulk is fish in a barrel and null/low sec mineral prices remain where they are, the risk / reward scenario doesnt pan out unless you are one of the lucky few i mentioned in the paragraph above. maybe prices of null sec minerals will make it viable to pay for security again, but thats not probable since its probably more designed to offset the insurance changes.just my 0.02isk.java"
5/6/2010,"hello,it will not make move miners to 0.0 but it will make people upgrade the existing systems and build real living places.then you will have more miners simply because there is more people around the same system.totally 100% even if just +5% for the last upgrade.li"
5/6/2010,"i don't live in 0.0, but all the material i've ever seen on minmatar outposts say that your proposal of 35% base refine, +5%/level, is already exactly the numbers that they have. am i missing something here?"
5/6/2010,other than he's drawing conclusions that just don't make sense? no not much.refinement at a minmatar outpost caps out at 50 to 80% (it wasn't the best but it didn't suck either) if i'm not mistaken... i was there... saw it myself. problem is there was a tax that kinda messed it up... so perhaps it is nearly 100%. don't remember... i know it wasn't 35% (check bpo's for outposts... that's where you'll get the base facts at because my refining skills pushed it pretty high)point is... the op is horridly misguided or misguiding the public.what he proposes would make alliances much more efficient and richer when it comes to the economics.in all honesty his alliance prob. got the crappiest hand dealt with there space and ended up with a ton of outposts none of which are minmatar or only one and having trouble getting there goods refined.this is nothing more than a stealth threadnaught trying to change the game mechanics in there favor.good intentions... but they go straight to hell. (at least the proposal is rational... just not good for the game)not supporting.while i would personally like to see all outposts get used for such things... i feel changing that now would really mess up the balance of power in a big bad ugly way.if it was that much of a problem... i say outposts should be destroyable/destructible... rebuild what you want... problem solved.
5/6/2010,"firstly - yes i screwed up the minmatar outpost's current status - my info was badly researched. so the minmatar outpost doesn't need a change to it's refineries.anyway, it's been pointed out that the same situation occurs with labs, factories and offices. e.g. the minmatar outpost gets zero lab slots out of the box, while caldari get plenty and the others get a few.so i guess this proposal should be broadened to include labs, offices and factories. maintaining the factional advantages, but bringing a basic level of all services to the outposts out of the box and allowing upgrades would make outposts a little more like an npc station."

5/6/2010,"hello people, i'm currently running for csm.here is what i would like to bring the table : a new module for da mothership that would enable them to recreate the phenomenas encountered sometimes in the wormholes : like more shields or better armor resists for the entire grid.that way your fleet would have to be designed to go in harmony with the effect of the module while also knowing the effect might benefit the other team.thus bringing back the name : mothership to it's full potential and scariness. (:vote for me :"
5/6/2010,"am i reading this wrong? aren't these already available in the gang-links that you can put on command ships, battlecruisers and carriers (and motherships? not sure if that got nerfed or not)."
5/6/2010,"no you are not reading this wrong. gang links have similar effects, but what i am proposing would be more powerful and affect everyone not just your fleet so the enemy might take advantage of it. also the phenomenas in the wormholes also have downsides to them like less capacitors and those comes along side with the bonuses."
5/6/2010,"so if i put in a mothership mod that improved shield recharge while reducing cap, and planned passive tanked drakes for my own fleet, i hope the enemy turns up in cap dependent active tanking ships then. if they show up in passive drakes, then i suspect a spai!it's worth considering."
5/6/2010,"but wormholes are not like normal systems, so you can't really compare those 2.and supporting this topic now is just plain stupid, since the op have no ideas on what can replace local.and eve wont really work without a local as things are now.so not supported by me though."
5/6/2010,give a comprehensive explanation on how you are planning on implementing:* a totally new and improved ship scanning system.* how it will balance cloaking.* how it will affect defender / attacker balance.* and more...if it doesn't impress as the changes to exploration then your idea is just the equivalent of a kid jumping up and down screaming to mommy buy me candy by me candy.
5/6/2010,against.if we pay for sovereignty what do we pay ?upgrade or if i'm right the maintenance of the system ...then jumpgate and communication.i'm agree if you link this point to the sovereignty and the standing.why the roamer can know who is in ?i'm paying for the tcu and gate not them.if you don't have standing then you jumpp in 0.0 as in wormhole.if you are in good term if the owners you know who jump in.if i go rpg to the end....why blockade unit must be set in the system if i pay the bill for the gate. i don't want bad people to enter in. but this will kill roaming gangs...but be more in a rpg line.
5/6/2010,supported for removal of local. constellation chat would then have a use and might actually get used!
5/6/2010,"how are wormhole systems not the same as a normal system? both have planets, belts, complexes, moons (but not moon mining of course), poss, and gates (yes, wormhole ones move, but still the same mechanic.) i can't find one difference between nullsec and wormhole sec aside fron the moving gates and general lack of capships. as for lowsec to wormholes, the only difference is bubbles/bombs/etc. and the previously stated differences. are you saying that moving gates makes such a big difference so as to make it impossible to remove local?as for replacement of local, the mechanic is already there. it's called scanning.fit expanded probe launchersend combat probe to center of systemscan???profitnot that difficult to bring a prober.*no need, as probes and scanning work as they are now.*from the cloaky gang aspect, it gives them a much more defined role. from the defender aspect, it will stop carebears and wimps from crying about afk cloakers. other than that not much change. you already couldn't find them, now you just have peace of mind.*both get a nerf and boost. attackers can now stage attacks and be less likely to be detected, until the attack is on the way, but at the same time, defenders can ambush and trap attackers much easier."
5/6/2010,"jag kara. please answer me this.as you say, you can just use the probe launcher and stuffs. well yeah, that kinda work to some point. but do you really think there is someone that want to spend a whole day to find out where every of the players in a system are?.specially when you think about bigger fleets. it would sucks horribly to scan out some targets to later find out that you had wasted hours to scan out players that was in different spots, but suddenly are at the same grid as the others right after?.when you think deeper into this, this will for sure never ever work by just removing local without replacing it with something else that can replace local."

5/6/2010,"the difference is the safety from roaming gangs. 0.0 has roaming and more pvp because:1. roams have local, allowing them to identify if there are targets to probe/search for in a system. it also allows them to identify when they are being followed by a defense scout.2. roams don't have to worry about the wh collapsing. getting stuck on the other side of eve 30-50 jumps from home can be rather annoying.roams rely on local, not voodoo to find systems with targets.1. would you suggest people wander blindly around looking for things to kill? with the current scanner and no local, that is what would happen. of course, this would be a boost to solo combat to some extent. solo pvp ship against ratter/miner that it.2. this would be a huge boost to stealth bombers. as i'm in love with stealth bombers, i'm not going to complain much, but i'm confident many would be crying for blood (nerfs) over this.3. you seem to be under the mistaken impression that things people attack would last long enough for defenders to respond. attacking fixed targets would be 100x easier without local. metagaming would dramatically increase as spies would become the primary method for finding fleets.p.s. everyone would fit eccm to be unscannable."
5/6/2010,"i support putting it into delayed mode but as said, there really needs to be an improved directional scanner to go with it. i pirate, i do fleet fights and yeah, i even run some low sec missions. the first two would benefit from such a change, the last would become horrible.as it stands, my mission base is pretty secure, mostly blues there and local tells me if a neutral or hostile comes in. i don't warp off and dock like a pansy each time a neut/hostile enters but it does put me on alert for probes. at which point i start the usual scan every 5 seconds deal till they leave or i confirm it's a non-threatening ship. without local i'd have to sit there and hit scan every 5 seconds from the time i leave station till the time i come back. yes i can do it but i'm far more likely to stop traditional missioning instead. this is keeping in mind i solo lvl5's so 30 minutes of missioning gives me a solid 70-100m isk (single clienting). even that wouldn't be tolerable.eve needs a radar and radar warning system as has existed in militaries around the world for 50+ years. if something like that is implemented so i get automated updates and some sort of warning of probes (even if only a few seconds before a warpable point), i would fully support removing local. in any case i think this should be a high priority for ccp."
5/6/2010,"i was thinking what would really bring people from high sec into low sec and what is a very common thing that people do in high sec. then i thought well there a tone of people who mission and by all the pos'es at every moon in high sec there are a tone working on faction standing so they can place that pos. then i asked myself why do i only do exploration in low sec and not bother with missions in low sec.so here is my proposals. make missions like pvp, how? well rather a spam of npc ships that require you to use failguns aka railguns make the mission consist of 1 to 3 uber npc ships that are pvp fit such as blasters/web/mwd/scam, sort of like a leet overseer from a complex. this way the mission runner can use a pvp fit to run his mission and have a real chance to defend themselves if they run into a lone pirate at a gate, though you are still screwed if there is a camp. also you spend less time in the mission so you are less likely to be probed out. another thing i know people would love is if you could run missions for pirate factions and i have an idea that would add a twist to it that will make those carebears to want to come into low sec. in addition to the pirate loyalty point store you get a new option to spend those points on and that something call ""bribe a public official"" what this would do is allow you to bribe a public official to give you faction standing for that empire at a faster rate. so say your running serpentis missions you could get gallente faction standing. just imagine how many people would come to low sec if they could more quickly boost their faction standing to either fix it or to place a pos in high sec rather than grind missions for months in high sec. i even asked around in local as i was board doing sell orders. i asked what do most of them fear about going into low sec and i got a bunch of noobie players saying getting ganked at gate by pirates. so i had a thought about this as well and this i know will be a very unpopular idea to pirates and i mean i like low sec pvp and such but i think we need to accept changes if we want more targets. i say sentry guns be increased at gates and stations in 0.4/0.3 and the current number be left alone in 0.2/0.1 it will make people feel more safe and if this brings in more people. you will have more people to maybe catch in belts as they rat/mine and targets you can probe out. i mean i'm sorry if we have to actually hunt rather than sit at a gate but its something i think could really help bring people in.in the end i think these changes would not take a tone of effort by ccp to do and i really think it would appeal to to high sec people giving them a fighting chance being in pvp fits and make it worth the risk as well as make it feel more safe to them when it still really isn't. it also still gives pirates target but just not by camping gates all the time. anyway i am ready to be cussed out by pirates so let the flaming begin other than that any real feedback is welcome."
5/6/2010,- in part this has already been done by the introduction of pirate faction epic arcs. it sure would be a good idea to extend this to normal low sec pirate missions as well. scaling could be done simply via the normal mission levels. l1 you face frigs ... 
5/6/2010,"you got some pretty good ideas here, and ones that i've been considering myself. let me address each issue in turn.1) agreed, but there should be more. levels 1-2 (or 3) should be able to be done in a frigate (similar to the new pirate arcs). level 4 and maybe 3 should be done in a hac or something similar. this way, you have a better chance of surviving the gatecamps on your way to your mission. special agents should be instituted so you get the new 'low-sec' missions instead of the normal 'high-sec' missions.2) i actually can't agree here. the agents need unique items (similar to what fw has), but the bribery issue i really can't see. maybe have items available in the lp shop that are illegal in high-sec.3) this could be done, but it might be better to increase the damage dealt by the guns. have guns on the periphery to high-sec deal 2x damage, and have it go down as you approach empire 0.0. this also makes role-playing sense, as the guns deeper in high-sec would be maintained less.another idea i had is to move all belts in low/null sec to grav sites. ships like the barges and exhumers (and perhaps the mining ships, like the bantam and osprey) would be able to find grav sites with their on-board scanner.overall, i agree with most of your statements, and low-sec definitely needs a boost. this is, imho, much better than the outlaw concept, as it'll bring new players into low-sec. supported."
5/6/2010,"good idea.also, a good pvp mission objective is to kill someone with less than -0.1 sec status or something. no security loss from that single kill."
5/6/2010,"the bribery is necessary for this to work as its the main thing to bring people in. just think about how many people spend countless hours fixing faction standings or trying to get high faction for ""pos"" placement. if you gave people a faster alternative they would almost defiantly do it even if some risk was involved and making the missions so you fighting in a pvp fit actually give you a good chance to survive in low sec. i have spent the better part of a year fixing my faction standings. i use to be locked out of 3 of the 4 factions space after kill my standings doing level 5's being a pirate and not caring. if i had a better way to fix my standing omg i and who else wouldn't pass that up.also for loyalty store items i was thinking things like what the pirate stores offer minus the best items such as ""low grade"" implants and maybe faction frigates. leave the the high grade implants and cruiser and up faction ships still in null sec so they're is still a point to run missions out there."
5/6/2010,"1. will the effect apply to all current agents?2. almost all of mission income comes from loot and salvage so dropping the rats to just 3 would nerf mission income to even less than lvl 3s, not to mention cutting out ninja salvaging as a risk to high sec missions. soon enough, even more ppl will switch to macro mining, creating more competition for the already oversupplied market of minerals.3. how would having 3 npc uber tanking ships tanking your dps while keeping u pointed make the mission go faster and make it less likely to be probed out? in this case, u can't even escape if u wanted to.4. how would u be able to survive a pirate fleet's dps long enough to even kill one of them when u're already taking heavy dps from the now-uber rats? and depending how uber the rats r to begin with, 3 of those rats could easily kill u anyway, since that's usually how it goes when it's 3vs1 in pvp.5. since they know u'll be fitted for close-range encounters since u'll be pointed, mwd jammed, webbed and have close-range guns, they won't even need tacklers so no killable targets for the mission runner to take revenge on--all they have to do is fit for mid-long range dps and the same result of ez gank would occur once again.6. what if the last of those rats had to drop a mission-critical item? can u kill all the uber rats fast enough before the pirate fleet catches u, kills u, steals the item, and tries ransoming it back to u?7. of course not because the rats r uber now and u can't sacrifice any tank for the extra dps needed, making missions less of a sandbox and more cookie-cutter fit required. and last time i checked, mining doesn't have a lick of pvp in it so there's another balance issue.8. and if this would require your own fleet to always do, it goes back to splitting income to the point where it's not even worth the trouble. and once again, it's back to more macro mining as the alternative.9. last but not least, look at the populated low sec systems, like amamake. 99% of those ppl r there for pvp so there's almost no mission runners to easy gank. yet, on a regular basis, it gets blobbed or even cyno blobbed. why? because there r plenty of targets all the time. if u applied this to the rest of low sec, yes, there will be more easy targets to gank...for a little while anyway. then when all of the above happens enough times to the mission runners, from even the rats and/or the roaming blobs that will increase in response to this, they will go back to high sec and things remain the same as before.10. if this was an option rather than a forced change to all missions, then there's no problem. otherwise, this isn't gonna fly because it doubles as a stealth nerf to missions and another way to ""force"" ppl into low sec for more easy ganks...which will still fail in the end..."
5/6/2010,"you bring up a lot of points and i really don't know what ya want i mean it is low sec its not high sec you cant make it have no risk. if you have spent time in low sec though you learn things to keep you alive. such as pay attention to local, keep you scanner active and take the time to do a little research on the area you in.to answer some of your questions.1) you would be working for a pirate faction such as serpentis or sansha so that means new agents located in low sec.2) i want to buff gate and station sentries in .4 and .3 systems to at least hamper camps of the mission runners.3) the uber npc ships in the mission would have very high bounties on them and have good chance to drop meta level 2 to 4 equipment. this can equal good payouts in the higher level missions.4) for the missions you want a typical pvp setup you don't want to be all tank. i don't want the mission being a tank fest and if you have ever tried to kill a very strong overseer in a complex you know if you don't have the dps you fail as they have a strong rep. also these missions are kill only not retrieve x item.5) i do exploration in high sec and low sec and i do my research on low sec systems before i start probing, i check for activity levels/who lives there/frequency of roaming gangs and when they typically come through. also gate campers, who they are and when they camp. i find most this info through killboards such as battleclinic or i search for their corp boards on the net after i spot them in system as i spy all cloaked up. its amazing how much of a fingerprint alliances and such leave cuz they want to show off they're kills.6) i get probed out while doing plexes and radar sites and most times i have my scanner active and the second i see combat probes i'm gone. this is what you should do in low sec missions and don't go flying back 15 minutes later thinking they are gone. go do something else! i've managed to get away while i got 15 bs shooting at me and leet frigs warp jamming me. always drag your npc attackers away from warp in point of the acceleration gate so your attackers have a long trip! if its an ambush situation on the warp in point well kill off the warp scam rats then drag the rest away.7) i never said anything about helping miners. low sec mining should be done in some worthless hole of a low sec system that no one ever really goes and you should have scouts on the gates in systems next door so if someone comes you run. mining in a dead end system and camp that one gate to hell works well to. also try putting 2 shield transfers on your orca and one gang link and you wont even have to worry about rats showing up if your hulk pilots have good combat drone abilities. i always hear someone crying about needing combat ships with the miners to stop the rats and ships guarding the gates. shield transfers will reduce the number of combat pilots needed thus less of a split. low sec mining sucks anyway go find a wh lol. only way to really make low sec mining safe is to turn low sec into high sec or make some sort of like mobile control tower that you can set up at belts and everyone can mine in the bubble but that's just lol.remember this is low sec you will get blown up at some point i mean really what do you want low sec to turn into high sec. i try and make the risk worth it though through bonus to faction standings and pirate faction loyalty point store. i dunno if you really feel you need more of an isk incentive maybe have one of the rats drop an overseers tear that concord buys from you this way you not flooding the mark with anything from these missions."
5/6/2010,"in principle i agree with making missions like pvp and adding pirate faction agents. i don't think there's any benefit to be had by increasing damage from the sentries -- criminals will just bring logistics ships with them or bigger ships with a better tank.in addition to making missions more like pvp you'll want to make sure that players can run them in cheaper ships. it's not really cost effective to attempt to run missions in expensive ships when you're likely to be ganked every third mission (unless you can make up your loss twice over or something).and, as for pirate faction missions, you'll want to stipulate that it's the lower level agents and not the level 4 agents; low-security space isn't the most dangerous space and shouldn't have the same rewards as null-sec.in general low-security space won't be more populated until it's more populated -- meaning, there's a chicken and egg problem. if you have more non-criminals in low-sec, it's going to be a little less dangerous -- but you won't get more non-criminals into low-sec until it's less dangerous.let criminals leave low-sec painlessly. add more low-sec. do whatever you can think of to dilute the concentration of criminals and you'll have a better experience all around."
5/6/2010,"i hate calling people stupid, so i'll just acknowledge that even smart people sometimes have stupid ideas and leave it at that.in-game actions get in-game punishements, up to and including exile (banning). that's it, what happens in game, stays in game.do you really think that ccp are going to monetarily penalise people for being active in keeping the game alive and healthy. it just doesn't make marketing or commercial sense in any way."

5/6/2010,"hi.very often there is necessity to move on 22-45 jumps, thus without transporting any cargoes. in this connection you couldn't consider reduction of time of preparation jump clone at least till 6 o'clock, and in ideal till 4 o'clock instead of 24 hours. it would solve many problems with settling or partial finding in zero regions of inhabitants of empire.is's easy. sorry to my english.bye."
5/6/2010,"if anything, jump clone timer should be longer, not shorter. no thanks."
5/6/2010,"what about the times when one has to move 21 jumps? btw i support this, mainly because i'm a lazy bastard. 15 minutes between jumps would be somewhat winny."
5/6/2010,skill to reduce to a maximum of 12 hours plz
5/6/2010,"please give me a single reason why any non cloacked ship should be impossible to scan down? i can see neither any gameplay-wise reason, nor any logical sence in that. if you want invisibility, get a cloack."
5/6/2010,"it is impossible to do anything with active cloak, with eccm you can try that lowsec mission, you can do your highsec missions without griefers going in for the completion trigger.the sacrifices you need to make to scan someone down are nothing compared to the sacrifices you need to make to nullify it as it stands, stopping any mechanic other than cloaking to prevent it would make probing way too powerful."
5/6/2010,there are other means of running a mission safely. making your ship unscannable and unvulnerable is not the way to go.
5/6/2010,"it is not the only way to go, but a viable one nonetheless, the single highslot of a probe launcher is in my opinion powerful enough as is, and a non cloak counter should exist. i would love a module that reduces sig as well, though that is another discussion. for a change in eccm this thread is derailing. i simply state that probing difficulty will be an issue, and am assailed by those who claim that everyone should be probable. that is not the content of the thread."
5/6/2010,"grr after spending a frustrating 3 hours using directional scanner to locate a macro ratters loot can i propose to make cans probable ( alongside wrecks for those pesky 'bin divers').mo atm is to locate it on directional scanner, then find a spot that is in line with said can and a warpable point, then to make bookmarks either side of the can and keep bming in ever decreasing amounts until you have a spot that can be traveled in a small, fast ship.even though it is possible using this method it is a total pita to do and when you are down to around 10000km as i am the last part is basically luck based, if you have any deviation on your approach you lose the direction you ought to be heading.as macro ratters are a huge problem at this time in the game, i want a reliable method to be able to catch them.hint, most macro ratters safe spots are within a 100km range of their safe spot loot can."
5/6/2010,supporting my own idea
5/6/2010,"if this happens, you'll simply see people stop anchoring gsc's in space. and at yet another half-baked proposal that will--of course--only be used to help defeat evil macros."
5/6/2010,we need at least one pink battleship : the hello kitty type.thus bringing more female players into the game and making our vents server more sexy to listen to.i'm going for csm and if you want to meet chicks with the same interest in eve online you have then : vote for me here :
5/6/2010,"i think you might mistake elementary school girls for the women that actually will enjoy this game.a lot of things can be improved that might irk women more then men, but improve the game for all. focusing on dumping an 8 year old girl from hello kitty online into the cold dark depths of 0.0 might not be the wisest of things."
5/6/2010,i'm all for pink ships. especially pink fur shipsplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.but leopardskin is much cooler.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.and zebraskin the best.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.-t'amber
5/6/2010,"hey,i don't know if anyone else finds this a problem, but let me speak my piece. gallente don't have a newbie friendly pvp frigate.the tristan, it would seem by the slot layout, is the current top tier frigate. but the main problem is, that you have to waste alot of sp (as a newbie) in missile launcher operation skills to make it any effective. unlike other races, missile skills are completely useless to gallente beyond this frigate. beside this, the frigate is extremely slow, it doesn't help that unbonused blasters have a very tiny effective range. and they're the main source of damage when it comes down to the sp and training, not just the ship bonuses.well what i would suggest is to make incursus the fotm frigate for gallente, give it 4/3/3 like it should have from the beginning, remove the drone bay (to level the damage output) and increse pg and cpu, 2 low slots are not enough for a newbie pvp/piracy ship, you have to choose between repair or ehp, it means drones raip you. make tristan like other frigates with sb as their t2 variant. give it 3 launcher slots, perhaps remove the drone bay too, bonus it's thermal missile damage, give it 4/2/2.to be very honest here, i hardly care what happens to the tristan, i'm just really tired of having to pick my poison when it comes to starting as gallente. atm it's either waste your sp on a really slow frigate with little effective range or use a cheap substitude for an interceptor.my second problem would be the fact, that there's no first tier to medium pulse lasers (low cpu and pg), this is the reason you can't fit an omen and a maller properly. these ships barely don't fit even with perfect fitting skills and what about newbie pilots? maller is really gimmicky, it doesn't do any damage and i can hardly find it fair that it can't fit a 1600mm plate and a set of guns. even then it'd barely hits and the ehp/dps ratio would still be worse than on other ships, but 'least it wouldn't be as terrible. same for the omen, could i perhaps fit an 800mm plate, a mwd and 5 guns on it? right now it requieres weird practics like fitting an ab or filling low slots with adaptive nano platings, i'm not even bothering to mention it's impossible to fit for newbie pilots.quad beams aren't a substitute here, they have serious tracking problems, there's no range gain and their t2 crystal selection is just awful.so, what you guys think? there's more to this ofcourse, like how the new lasers will affect the prophecy or the harbringer, there's alot of balance going into the frigate changes too, but i hope you find the idea reasonable."
5/6/2010,"i'm not sure about lasers, but the incursus already is the fotm for gallente pvp. you can outfit it to do quite a bit of damage and have the ew necessary to take down other frigs.not supported on the gallente frigate issue. not sure about lasers, but i haven't heard any problems from them (i don't fly amarr)."
5/6/2010,your problem is you want 1600mm plate + medium turrets. the gallente boats got to downgrade to small turrets in that case aswell.800mm plate+focused medium pulse works on an omen.
5/6/2010,"again, it's fotm for all the wrong reasons, one of them is the tristan.i'd like to see the 800mm omen fitting, please. or better yet, show me a newbie friendly fitting for that a tier 1 combat cruiser. rupture doesn't have problems fitting 1600mm, the thorax pg discussino is for annother topic. beside this maller has no bonuses to damage, it's dps to tank ratio is pathetic and fitting medium pulse lasers could fix this."
5/6/2010,"cute, but i have said the fittings you have posted aren't good, even before you did post them. doesn't the fact, that you absolutely require fitting rigs just to get your basic modules in bother you? or that you have to put inefficient modules into the low slots just to fill them up. i don't have to do it with other ships. why do amarr have such hard time with this.again, why aren't any of these ships newbie friendly, they're t1 cruisers and shouldn't require perfect fitting skills just to make them barely work.besides if i have problems reaching you with english then tell me ahead of time, cause it seems there's a problem with understanding what i wrote."
5/6/2010,you need fitting rigs for the mwd version. the links have a version with ab without any fitting rigs.and about the good or bad ... those are kind of the standard fits for them. of course you see the 1600 plate bait maller more often.
5/6/2010,"ccp already has a solution for docking games. they like to call it ""incarna"" this year.once wis comes out, docking games will cease to exist. station camped? go play some intergalactic bingo in the cantina!"
5/6/2010,i dunno this is just a off the shoulder idea but what if you increased the dock timer a bit and also add more undocking areas to station that you could chose when you leave the station. right now you just get one spot to exit the station that is camped to hell. maybe if they're were 3 exits it would spread the campers more thin and give you more of a chance to run.
5/6/2010,"really, how complicated does this have to be? base the @#$% timer on the mass of the ship."
5/6/2010,"i would like to propose a mid slot : the docking computer jammer !!!it would prevent people from doing the station game. people undocking carriers to remote repair during the station game would really commit the ship in question to the fight.but a docking jammer is quite a powerful device, that's why it can't just be that the warp scrambler also prevents docking, you need to sacrifice at least a slot to get that.also, it should reduce your sensor strength like the warp core stabilizers so you can't target undockers too fast. and i think freighters and transport ships should get like a +2 or +3 bonus to counter docking computers strength.i'm going for csm right now, so if u want this idea brought to the table, vote for me :"
5/6/2010,after stations have windows
5/6/2010,"not supported, another i win button.there has been far better suggestions of docking timers depending on the ships mass after aggression, a module that prevents anyone docking is totally overpowered and would be abused all over eve.put your weight behind the timer according to mass proposal, that is far more balanced."
5/6/2010,"not so keen on the covops cloak, but having them buffed with a few more hp and able to go through a covert jump portal would be very nice indeed.at present they're just a little to easy to lose.edit: supported the thread."
5/6/2010,"this is probably falling on deaf ears, but i must support to keep the hope alive!"
5/6/2010,"so if i get this right, you think the fact that this smack talker got suicide ganked by 10 ships is bad because he dropped roughly 420mil (434mil by bc standards)so:420mil/10=42mil.each ganker got (and only because they were way lucky on the drop) 42mil for thier efforts. it would have been much less if the 300mil mod didnt drop.if they bought the boats off sell orders they would already be in the whole by a couple mil (according to the numbers i just saw in jita at least) before fittings; so they didnt even get the 42mil.if they bought the boats off buy orders (and so they could profit from the ship going boom regardless of the drop) then some stupid sod sold them the boats for less than the ier. the likelyhood that they got more than 50mil total(drop+insurance) is slim. again if the a-type booster had not dropped they would have been looking at 12mil each, so if they buy boats from sell orders they make close to nothing. if they bought it off buy orders then who knows what they would have made...but probably not more than 17-18mil. plus they have the sec loss (which effects different people to varying degrees.... if you have access to ""safe"" 0.0 to rat in its negligable. if you do not it can be much more of an issue.)edit:spelling"
5/6/2010,"want to make lowsec worthwhile and increase the value of ores?move crok/bistot to lowsec , leave the gneiss/dark ochre in nullsec. let 'em enjoy their high security patrolled turf while giving lowsec a reason to exist."
5/6/2010,lower refine batch amount? that way less ore makes more?
5/6/2010,"this is officially the first thing ankhehiwefijhwiefiwe has said that i agree with. ccp could learn a lot from dwarf fortress when it comes to pi, imo. it's an awesome game and possibly has a steeper learning curve than eve."
5/6/2010,adam who?
5/6/2010,"ccp always say they don't have time, or that it is 'put in the backlog'. perhaps they should work less on rushed expansions.the expansion model they use, will not work in the long term. yes, they will likely attract or retain a lot of players because of the shiny trailers, but ccp is damaging their reputation every time players become disappointed by the actual expansion content.eve has a rich backstory and there is plenty that can be done with it. sure, the two events that happened in fw were somewhat interesting, even though the fw fundementals are broken. players want to leave their mark on the game, that's the purpose of a sandbox after all, and it would be logical that the capsuleers will determine the outcome of events.that's why i am sad that ccp makes static epic mission arcs. pre-scripted 'quest' stuff can never compare to actual live events. instead of builing that engine to create epic arcs, they should've created tools to facilitate live events. npcs should also be a lot more dynamic, and occasionally should stir up trouble for the players to deal with. succeed and the threat is averted, fail and something gets overrun. it's not like this is something impossible, guild wars 2 will rely heavily on this, and they're starting to introduce this system to guild wars 1 as well, as the outcome of gw1 live events will determine the backstory of gw2.for those that think this is too much pve, yes it relies on pve, but in eve these events can be set up to be very competetive, especially in a pirate faction or fw setting."
5/6/2010,"i would say your campaign is going rather well. keep running for csm, the ammount of lulz i had from this thread was awesome ... especially those logs"
5/6/2010,"i say yet again:i see you manage to totally ignore all the quotes from yourself.. how do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you don't even attempt to refute -your own quotes- ?not only do your own quotes make a liar out of you - you then simply ignore any posts that call attention to them.srsly. quotes from you that directly contradict what you've been trying to say during this thread and you won't even acknowledge them. gotta love those blinkers.p.s; yes - i plan to paste this after every single reply you make until you address them, as to inform the people what kind of two-faced individual we're dealing with."
5/6/2010,"yes, yes it is indeed."
5/6/2010,i second that. you've almost surpased 10k reads which is great marketing regardless of what the content is :)-t'amber
5/6/2010,forget it mate - she says she won't reply to 'trolls'.a troll being someone who would like to debate her issues and/or doesn't 100% agree with her 'vision' of how eve should be.i.e. hello kitty in space or something similar.
5/6/2010,"well regardless what the trolls say, ive read every single link provided and absorbed as much as i can, ive only ever voted once for vuk and since then nver voted or gave any interest to the csm, however after reading annk's manifesto - ive given her my 2 votes as she seems to be someone i would like to represent myself with my varied and wide experiences of the game.ankh 2 votes winging your way"
5/6/2010,lmaolying on your cv is bad ok?
5/6/2010,"if you'll notice, ankhe won't even deny those quotes. even a simple ""i have changed my mind since then and they no longer represent my opinion"" would be a start... but, as we've proven, ankh is still a bitter carebear with an agenda to stop the 'parasites' from ruining puzzle pirates in space. unfortunately, there are a lot of bitter carebears who will see this as a chance to lash out through voting."
5/6/2010,"i actaully admire someone who has the backbone to let trolls spam their crap and just plain ignore them instead of going into a flame war.i tip my hat for eva jobse that she can actually manage to just stay constructive in the replies towards the real questions and completely ignore the ****s.this is far better than i could have done.the thing i also like is that she looks at the whole game and not just at the narrow vieuw of the pvp crowd.they all call eve mainlt pvp focussed. well in some way they are right, but market pvp is a lot more work that a gatecamp.trade is way bigger than pvp since as soon as someone sells or buys they actually partake in trading. and to be fair, not 100% does the pew pew thingy, but 100% does to the trade thingy in one way or another."
5/6/2010,this thread confirms beyond doubt that people who drive new minis are bat**** crazy.
5/6/2010,"i knew there was something off about this toad, ever since i watched her engrish whining about fw in the fanfeast video's"
5/6/2010,"yeah, only we're not trolling. we're making serious points and she continues to ignore them or cry troll the moment she sees a comment that isn't in agreement with her. she backpeddles and has contradicted herself multiple times and has stated she doesn't even enjoy the game.edit - watch as she either completely ignores this post or calls me a troll"
5/6/2010,"you guys do realize that with all your whining and *****ing and moaning about ank's positions/statements/stuff, that you've pretty much whipped up any idiot that has ever been scammed, ganked or suicided into voting for her?i'm predicting that ank makes it onto the csm again - and that the trolls in this thread, instead of hurting her chances, are actually helping her...if you really wanted her out - you should have just ignored her - now she's a *celebrity* carebear..."
5/6/2010,"uh huh, no trolling here, none whatsoever, i've never seen a less trolled thread in all my days of eve. it's an outrage ppl are being demonised here!"
5/6/2010,"lol..under specific skills she has: ""broad general knowledge and structured and logical thought"
5/6/2010,"yeah, but she was before too. realistically, there's no way we were ever going to keep her off the csm. yeah, there's been some trolling in this thread, it'd be hard to deny that. but there's a lot less than ankh claims. asking a serious question in a mean way isn't trolling, it's just being slightly jerkish. but tossing up softballs is not the job of a critic. this thread could stand to be more polite, but the questions and concerns being raised are legitimate."
5/6/2010,"yeah, because asking someone to explain why they say one thing and yet their quotes show them saying something totally different is really trolling..all i've seen so far is a candidate that ignores questions she doesn't like and pretends her old quotes don't exist when they come back to bite. that and people supporting this behaviour."
5/6/2010,"thanks a lot for voicing your support!let me know if there's anything i can do after the elections, and stay in touch!"
5/6/2010,"you cannot say ""i don't like raising the term limit"" and then immediately ""but i'm going to take advantage of it to run again."" apparently, fighting in a video game is immoral, but being an unashamed liar is not immoral. ankhe contradicts herself in the same sentence, ignores and refuses to confirm/deny her previous statements, and has simply stopped replying with anything except ""you're all mean trolls"".---- even if you agree with her politics, how can you put your faith in a csm candidate who will simply cower in the corner and call the other representatives trolls if they don't agree with her? she's proven herself completely incapable of handling herself in a rational debate or justifying her statements. she refuses to respond or disprove her detractors. if you have ever done any kind of pvp ever, it's obvious why voting for her would be a terrible idea. if you have not done any kind of pvp ever, it would still be a wasted vote better spent on someone with the backbone to stand up for their own ideas, rather than hiding and covering her eyes at the first sight of opposition. even if you're the most bleeding heart carebear, your vote is deserved by someone with the guts to actually push their ideas."
5/6/2010,"first off i did not share ankh's views and did not vote for her, but the amount of trolling and ****storming done in this very thread are kinda disturbing, while some guys tried to stay mature and ask questions some others are running a ""omg-carebear"" campaign and just try to make her look miserable whenever they can.csm is playing democracy online, and what is done here is just yellow press quality threadnaughting, when you do not like ank do not vote her.this thread is so full of mudslinging that it gives the intention that if you would not go here and sling mud ank might get elected, but instead of actually preventing that election by supporting your candidate you have created an propaganda campaign visuall for any carebear all time, and have done so in most of the time rly not appropiate ways.if all this would have been a pr stunt it would be just brilliant.congratulations you have just boosted the votes of your least favourite csm candidate."
5/6/2010,confirming direct quotes are mud slinging.
5/6/2010,that was a low blow.also sniped.
5/6/2010,wow...just wow.
5/6/2010,"ankh, i'm having difficulties accessing your current campaign video.good luck, regardless!"
5/6/2010,"thing is she is on the carebear bandwaggon yet has no to little clue about the industrial side. no pvp knowledge yet spouting crap on how she will ""sort out "" low and null sec. she is going to fix fw yet all she did was to exploit the bugs and use stabbed frigs with cloaks. she "" learned a great deal about life and war in 0.0 "" yet was not in the cva defense fleets or got involved in the running of the corp. she very happy to jump on anything that sounds good and will be popular but there are balance issues that effect wider aspects of eve and she is clueless, generally speaking these pvp'ers and pirates she hates so much have better all round knowledge of eve as they all have carebear alt's or mains !!"
5/6/2010,"**** it. why should the rest of us stand by and wait for csm members to embarrass themselves and make a joke out of it when we can do it too. voting for ankhesentapemkah for the lulz factor. her being on the csm will be a non-stop troll to the rest of them. you movie was utter **** tbh. you talk thru your teeth which is really annoying too. all the same, the amount of tears you are generating is too good to pass up."
5/6/2010,voting ankh just to see the drama unfold :) this idiot has a year of hell ahead of her.. but i kinda lost interest to care because she has a thing of putting the point through that my own amusement > then her mental household.
5/6/2010,i'm inclined to agree. the csm will need a good secretary to do all the woman's work anyway. i've already voted so you won't be seeing any from me though...
5/6/2010,"focus group schedule update: i had to change the time of the sunday 9 may ""blobs"" focus group to a few hours later due to a rl obligation that shifted. sorry and hope this actually makes it possible for more folks to consider participating in that one. i really appreciate all the support, both in this thread and in the evemails, in-game channels, and other venues."
5/6/2010,"would be down for the low sec focus group if you wanted me.xwould sit in on the ecm panel, but i can only speak to the use of ecm from an fc's pov and not from the boat itself."
5/6/2010,i'll admit that i like the idea of quicker communication from ccp in terms to widespread player reactions. how do you see the csm becoming more involved in this?
5/6/2010,"you don't know me (at least not under this character), but you have both of my votes :)"
5/6/2010,"i was looking down the list, flitting through pointless n33bcake candidacies, wondering where i'd find the noir. candidate.you have my vote, carole mynxee, if only for being one of the few competent women on the internetz (a serious business)."
5/6/2010,two votes flying over your way!

5/6/2010,thank you gentlemen!
5/6/2010,issler gets my vote. she seems to be the most down to earth candidate and for someone like me that is happy to not join a player corp i think she fits what i want the most in this game.also as a portal fan the video was awesome!poppy
5/6/2010,please everyone support the csm process and vote for a candidate today if you haven't voted already!issler

5/6/2010,"thank you for your kind words, but i really don't mind people disagreeing with me, as long as they do it reasonably politely. it helps refine my positions and arguments, and occasionally i find out i'm wrong, and so learn something new.and if you think my candidacy is worthwhile, consider evemailing your buddies and asking them to support me."

5/6/2010,"i understand that ccp runs a business, and shiny new ships sell subscriptions, so they'd rather put resources into those than doing anything with the kind of useless ships out there. of the six frigates per race out there, maybe two of them are used for something other than lighting cynos. so that's 16 ships that aren't really used. ideally i'd love to see them made useful, i'm not talking about making them awesome just not useless. i'm not going to hold my breath, however.i'm just going with the ""i died for sportsmanship"" :smug:bonused damps could definitely use some love. i remember when damps so op every roaming ship had them. and now? heck, i don't even put them on my lachesis because they're that bad, but the ships themselves are handy in select roles. i mean, i'd probably never turn a curse or a falcon/rook away from a gang and i'd definitely make people change out of we had two arazus/lachs. but does that mean they are bad? i don't think so.i'm definitely not of the view that every ship needs to be just as good as another ship of the same class, but gallente (and minmatar) definitely got the shaft when it comes to e-war bonuses. i'd have to do some more research, but i think changing the arazu/lach bonus from 5% boost per level to 7.5% boost per level would make damps at least considered on those ships. even if damps were to become viable, i still think the most common setups for them would see them looking like the rapier: that is to say a heavy tackler with a buffer.could do if people really loved their skiffs...but the skiff is what, 10% better than a hulk at mining mercoxit? i don't think it would cause riots in the streets, but not something i'd dismiss eitherin eve, if you undock you better be expecting some sort of risk, i don't care if it's 1.0 or 0.0. you can pretty much mitigate risk with certain actions, but you can never anticipate the people who are really bored. suiciding exists, i like that it exists, and the only change i'd consider making to it is nerfing the insurance payouts. i've done it before; it's tedious, annoying, and unless you get a space pinata it's not even that profitable. as far as t2 insurance, and i know i'm not going to be popular by saying this, but i'm fine with it as is. what makes pvp in eve so great is that when you die, you have a sense of loss. i hear the argument that if ships were cheaper people would be more inclined to pvp, but i think it would change pvp so much that it wouldn't be enjoyable. maybe i have a warped view of the game. i'm glad, and thanks for your vote"
5/6/2010,bumping for a winnerwhat are your thoughts on people killing macros while not showing up in system?
5/6/2010,would you support putting the old warp sounds and some of the effects like turret recoil back in?
5/6/2010,"i really wish i could promise the return of the old cyno effect and ship trails, i think my victory would be assured. realistically i can't promise anything, but i know how strongly the community feels about restoring these classics and i can convey these sentiments. as far as putting the old warp sounds in, i think my response is ""eve has sound?!"" i'll talk to some others and see what they think about warp sounds, if it's a big hit that i was just oblivious to i'll add it to my ""ship trails and cyno effect"" topic.can you push to re-activate my sphere account? my pvp numbers have dropped off hugely without it :smith: combine that with lack of gangmates flying in the fist formation and man..."
5/6/2010,ty loli like being the only candidate whose sole desire is to improve the process lolx
5/6/2010,"u've got nice ideas, get my voice, gl"
5/6/2010,"i'm interested in what you think to accomplish with this change (not that i believe there is a chance in hell of ccp actually doing it).honest question, i want to know your thoughts."
5/6/2010,"i wish to stop inflation of isk. i wish to see risk vs reward concept actually implemented, not just ccp promises. i wish, that there were more incentives for people to leave highsec. i wish to see more people in lowsec and nullsec."
5/6/2010,"don't u think that if insurance will be removed, pvp won't be so massive ?"
5/6/2010,"i do not think, that it'll influence quantity of pvp. uninsurable t2 ships are very popular, so are t3 cruisers and even faction battleships. on the other hand, with the removal of insurance, we will see more diversity. newbies will longer fly cruisers and battle-cruisers, in place of badly fitted battleships. for example, maller makes great pvp ship, but it's often overlooked, because ""bleh, it's t1 cruiser!""."
5/6/2010,"do you know that majority of the players lives in empire and runs missions there, don't you?"
5/6/2010,"i feel the need to add:do you know that majority of the players lives in empire and runs missions there, because they don't have time to play eve more than 2 hours per day ?if you want to play eve versus world of warcraft game:- eve its not about struggling your way to get a better ship. it's about the patience you got to learn that ship. eve has ways to provide the money to get that ship, inflation i dont think it was an issue for ccp when they introduced this system. why should i learn a better ship if the devs give me a hard time buying that ship ? why should i play the game if i find financial barriers in front of me ?- wow, on the other hand, it is about struggling your way to get a better gear. you can have top mint gear without a single money spent.see the difference between eve and wow ? both games have its ups and downs ( where eve provides, wow lacks and vice versa ), but both games are made to attract more subscribers.and if i move to low sec with a battlecruiser and get blown up, how am i going to afford another battlecruiser full fitted ? yes, dont fly ships you cannot afford, so im goint to low sec with enough cash to buy another fully fitted battlecruiser. what happens if i lose this one too ? how am i going to do some isk if i dont have the ship for it ? in a rooky ship ? yes, you wont have enough isk from the both lost bcs, cause there's no insurance. so you're forced to mine roids in the rooky ship ? no, thank, i'm not going to play this kind of game !if you want for the game to be more unforgiving, then the online population would drop significantly. i think it would be really boring for your alliance to conquer space without people to fight back. yes, you'd make tons and tons of modules from plexes and deds, but who would buy your modules ? the enemy ?if the population drops ( which will happen with the changes you want ), have you asked yourself about the impact on prices ? again: how are you going to sell a module/ship if there's none to buy it ? and second:you only provide some changes, but no solution for what those imply.it's like saying: ""i want a new furniture in my room"", but you dont calculate if that furniture fits in your room and how you're going to get that furniture in your room.and, for your information, the wow community don't care about eve. they dont say: ""go to eve, nuuuub !""yes, i've been a wow player and i'm now playing eve. but that's because a real life friend told me about eve and i sometimes play with him.edit: for the blind folks, i didn't say wow = eve or eve = wow. i just analyzed the games from the mechanics point of view, how both game are designed.edit: added some air in the post, so it wont appear as a block of text"
5/6/2010,"it's not wow, in eve there are many ways of making money, not only npc killing, and if a person can think a bit he can earn money without any missions, so if lvl 4 missions will be removed from empire it will be still ok, that's my personal mind, so corbeau good luck !"
5/6/2010,"and? what's you point?and? you want to tell me, that it is impossible to live in nullsec with such schedule? you would be surprised, how many freelance/casual corps there are in 0.0 . this is only valid point in whole paragraph. there are no ""epic"" or ""legendary"" ships in eve. every ship is good one, if you know when and where to use it. think before you act. why, in the first place, you need to do the same mistake twice? if you got blown up, then you did something wrong. there is plenty of money to be made in nullsec. or do you think, that people there do not fly in the pimped t2/faction battleships? do not compare me to yourself. i always think about consequences of my own decisions beforehand. go back to wow.what this game needs - it is less whiners and carebears, but more people, who are ready to stand up for own self and fight, when needed. you two just prove my point, there is to many carebears, who are afraid to leave highsec, because it's so comfortable and profit is almost as good as in less safe systems. so why bother? and that's why the game should be changed. there should be incentives to bother to leave your precious motsu or dodixie. if these changes will be implemented, some people will leave, that's for sure, but it will also attract more pvp-minded people, who enjoy fighting and competing. eve was designed as the pvp-oriented game and we want it to stay that way. be ready to fight, to think, to learn, to deceive or go play some other game."
5/6/2010,+1do you think that bringing players into low sec will they also go to 0.0 ? more battles for 0.0 space ?
5/6/2010,if you have any questions about my campaign please feel free to ask.happy birthday eve online!!!
5/6/2010,i just noticed your thread was in danger of slipping off the front page and didn't want that to happen. so this is a blatant bump.you have my full support.
5/6/2010,teadaze you have a solid outlook and impressive dedication.you got my two votes just now. :)
5/6/2010,your manifesto states you prefer to avoid nerfs. the nerf t2 bpo thread has a clear majority against this nerf. however vote match states you are strongly in favour of nerfing t2 bpos.how do you justify this inconsistency?on what other issues would you ignore voter sentiment to pursue your own personal agenda?
5/6/2010,"firstly i never said i won't support any nerfs just as i won't support every buff. as i stated, i prefer to buff other items instead of nerfs. however in some instances ccp feel action has to be taken even if we as the players dislike it.on the subject of t2 bpos i agree with a number of players that it is time they were changed into high run bpcs or remove the penalties on invented t2 bpcs instead. the thread you mention makes a reasonable request and has more supports than many of the issues raised by csm so why should it be ignored?but i'm not ignoring voter sentiment! i'm choosing in this instance to support a group of people who you appear to disagree with. on other issues the reverse may be true. the wonderful thing about the csm is that all views are taken into consideration and because it is rare for 100% of players to agree on anything there will always be somebody who ""loses"".i don't have any personal agenda of pet projects to push through csm. i am running as i did last time on the platform of ensuring the csm process is adhered to, well documented and that everyone has the chance to have their views represented.it is my belief that if an issue gets a good number of supports then it should be dealt with, even if it ends up being raised and rejected (which would block it being raised again for a while )."
5/6/2010,"sometimes in *leading* it is necessary to ignore voter sentiment (making empire safer than it is now is popular with some people, for instance)."
5/6/2010,"to not go with the majority of the voters is not to ignore the voters. it is to take a stand.i would not want to vote for a person, who would only propose majority proposals. such a windbag would be of no use to anyone."
5/6/2010,"i cannot possibly vote for teadaze!ever since he was elected to csm4 he has spent so much of his time on it he seems to hardly ever have time to pvp with us anymore!on a serious note, the amount of time and effort tea has put into csm this last term has been phenomenal - i know people who put less time and effort into their jobs! tea is a really realiable guy, he's got a solid understanding of eve and i've repeatedly been impressed by the way he's handled things in his last term, especially with regards to building legitimacy for the csm process.take my admittedly biased view for what it's worth, but a vote for tea is a vote well placed."
5/6/2010,2x for teadaze.
5/6/2010,"i'm worried, vuk lau and elvenlord in csm will probably cause 0.0 to remain stale as it is now, not suggesting anything related to 0.0 that doesn't benefit themselves or the nc, or the expansion of this space empire they have."
5/6/2010,"mr. concerned there is no need to be worried. majority of things proposed related to 0.0, both by elvenlord during csm 4.0 and myself during csm 2.0 and csm 3.0 was exactly opposite. the main idea we promote is to ease access to both space and resources to smaller entities or even rather small groups of players who wants to venture to 0.0if you dont believe us, i will quote one of the exdevs csm closely worked with"
5/6/2010,where do i go to vote?
5/6/2010,+1 for elvenlord
5/6/2010,"one for each, good luck"
5/6/2010,"voted for both even though i'm mostly a lowsec guy, since i'm ok with their stances on things, at least on the important ones."
5/6/2010,worst thing in game imo (apart from lag in big battle but this is issue with all mmo i've played) is macro ratters. do you think anything can be done about it? i would like see all sub-bs rat scrambling and can't use cloak for 15mins after rat aggro just so there is at least a chance to catch macro ratter without hours of login trapping and attempting to bubble them at belt.even make it so belt rat only spawn when the belts are being mined and move off the officer/faction spawns to anomalies.
5/6/2010,+1 elven+1 vuk
5/6/2010,1
5/6/2010,"look at the planetary interaction system that's in the process of being added, we have a bunch of planet types which have been automaticly generated, thanks to some basic understanding of physics the planets have correct surface gravities, escape velocities, surface temperatures and other physical characteristics. however the actual planet types that are core to the planetary interaction feature appear to be somewhat random, with 'temperate' planet types that have surface temperatures 200 degrees below the freezing point of water. i know the icelandic climate can be quite chilly at times, so maybe that's what passes for temperate weather up there.it's probably too late to fix this, as of may 18th people will start deploying planet specific installations and changing planet types about will upset the new economy.now, could we get the same distribution of planet types in the universe in a more sane manner? absolutely! would it make the gameplay any different, not at all. would it improve eve - sure, for the people who notice this kind of thing, the science geeks, the role players and the fiction writers. for everyone else it wouldn't detract.understanding of science and science fiction won't have a direct bearing on gameplay decisions for gameplay sake, but for the kind of background info that makes the universe 'more real' for some players that's where it steps in. it doesn't necessarily improve 'the game' but it improves eve."
5/6/2010,"thank you for the nice reply t'amber! and wow soo many pics, you do really have a way with those. though please nooo furry megathron (the striped one is quite cool though).but please be nice to my fellow sebiestor chribba, i am sure he also like badgers so no need to get too many corpses of his ..."
5/6/2010,seems interesting. what is it you want to accomplish or prove with your simulator resp. your social experiment?
5/6/2010,got my vote
5/6/2010,good luck t'amber!
5/6/2010,"although i am a competing candidate, just wanted to say good luck in your campaign! if we both get elected, i look forward to working with you on csm5."
5/6/2010,"i normally wouldn't like a goon, but you come across as very friendly and honorable. good luck in your campaign!"
5/6/2010,"hello avalloc.i'd like to thank you for your plex promotion. it was the catalyst in spurring me to be more active in the csm process, i'm not sure that i'd have actually posted questions of my own without that little nudge.as for my question for you, i would appreciate it if you would discuss your position on the issue of transferable kill rights and the fixing/creation of a viable bounty hunter system. my own personal feelings are that this would increase pvp in low/hisec and adds a very sandboxy game play element into eve that is weak if not missing currently. thanks!"
5/6/2010,and thank you for taking advantage of the promotion and helping the csm process grow.i'm for transferring kill rights. it would add a new dimension to the pvp in empire. it would promote a whole new occupation of players acting as vigilante.
5/6/2010,avalloc once pulled me from a burning building. true story.
5/6/2010,bumping self for great justice
5/6/2010,"i can attest to dv's dedication to the game, open mindedness and ability to perform!good luck dv."
5/6/2010,you have my vote plus all my other accounts
5/6/2010,"""to jump clones""... how do they need to be 'fixed'?"
5/6/2010,"after talking to folks in-game, they talk about how jump clone timer of 24hrs is really long. for active pvp'rs, they'd like to have the option to move about the galaxy a little faster, or on a short notice like when their 0.0 corp has a call to arms, or they'd like to switch between different combat clones when the different battles call for it, etc. that it removes their motivation to pvp. high sec'rs say that they would like to decrease the barrier to entry into pvp for them, ability to switch back into their +5 clones n such. so after talking to these people about what they'd like to see, my proposed idea is to introduce a skill (rank 5-8) that would reduce the jump clone timer 10% decrease per level, for 12hrs min @ lvl5 [rank, %, and min time can be worked out]. it wouldn't be an easy train, it'd be a toughy, but people who value it would invest in it. (full read here:"
5/6/2010,"nice tool. though i knew who i will vote for long before voting started, actually it is the same person who i voted for last time (he did pretty well, i'm more then satisfied, so he should be there for a 2nd term)but still i'll repeat my opinion once again:there should be at least some questions about trading... because i spend most of the time in jita, and all that pvp/pve stuff isn't really interesting for me, and manufacturing/science question aren't directly connected to my profession. and i don't care about scammers (they aren't getting in my way, and they cannot possibly be in my way)."
5/6/2010,"ya i agree with dierdra.this isn't propaganda toward anyone one candidate, so it wouldn't really be considered a ""park speech,"" more like a ""voter education"" or ""citizens poll"" at the most.the match site only helps uninformed voters align themselves with a candidate who is more in tune with their ideas about the game. ccp & csms past have repeatedly said that voter turnout is the main issue with csm, and they'd like to see more % of voters. by moving it from the general forums, you're removing the popularity from the subject. you should put it back in general."
5/6/2010,<deity> forbids that ccp draw attention to the csm voting process...
5/6/2010,you'll have my vote! so don't shoot me! ...ok!? lolz
5/6/2010,you have my vote
5/6/2010,you get my vote omber
5/6/2010,"wow, someone bumped my thread. thanks rattus so, anyone got any questions for me? song lyrics they'd like me to murder?"
5/6/2010,"thanks extreme, consider this notification of -7 votes from last year's total!good luck!"
5/6/2010,the campaign video did it for me
5/6/2010,"always respected ob, you got my vote"
5/6/2010,"same always had respect for ob and what they mean to the game. all the details in your bullet points are things that have been needed to be sorted for a long time in this game and its about time they were tbh. you also have my vote and lets hope the real things that are important to this game are finally fixed not just mindless blobs with no skill / knowlegde of ship fittings, real pvp that sit there day after day to x up into a 800 man fleet become something of the past. and the game brings out and shows the truely talented pvper'spj"
5/6/2010,you have my vote!
5/6/2010,each candidate for the csm will hopefully have a thread posted in the jita park speakers corner forum. and so each week until the election ends im going to be giving away one plex to two lucky players who took the time to engage a csm candidate (not just me) with a serious question. the questions will be tracked by my web site at
5/6/2010,week 3 entry acceptance ends in 1.5 hours.

5/6/2010,i'm not surprised at this at all... ankh's true colours are flying high and bright.
5/6/2010,which system is she saying this in?
5/6/2010,cripes
5/6/2010,ankh is clearly greifing us
5/6/2010,theres nobody better in eve at trolling nerds. not even ididn't vote for her of course but i hope she gets in the csm just for the lulz
5/6/2010,"you're a better troll than i am, i tip my fuzzy hat to you"
5/6/2010,oh gosh..you sad little person...
5/6/2010,"the sad mare had an alt spamming that crap in the amarr militia channel last night, she thought it quite smart that she nore even have the basic scram skills done when asked to x up."
5/6/2010,also she has a fat face and a double chin
5/6/2010,"hey, it's not easy being deaf."
5/6/2010,worse being deaf and ugly.......
5/6/2010,"to continue my monologue... i'm back and of course happy to answer any further questions. i'm also delighted to see that i seem to be a good match for many people who've used the excellent vote match website.that said, i think it must be stressed (having listened to what has been said by prospective and actual csm members) that my preferences for the future direction of eve are relatively unimportant compared to the importance of being able to persuade ccp to implement what has already been agreed by all parties as being very sensible ideas. i think that this is where the csm realistically needs to focus its attention, and where i can particularly add value with my particular background. i realise i could make things more interesting by promising to hold the developers at gunpoint until they created mission ai that passed the turing test and gave out free donuts for everyone, but it would be neither realistic nor honest..."
5/6/2010,"guys, i have to admit i haven't paid enough attention to know who the candidates are. in the real world, we have political parties to make things a little simpler. so can anybody save me some time and tell me: who's the republican in the race?(joe starbreaker, owner of the fighting republicans)"
5/6/2010,it's a no party system; but you can use vote match to help determine who most closely aligns with your viewpoint.is this a serious response to a troll?
5/6/2010,"i'd rather pick somebody who's been vetted for their character and ideas (not just their checklist of positions) in a party primary. since that's not possible, i'll vote for whichever candidate most convinces me of their support and admiration for sarah palin. (candidates, you may reply in this thread.) as ceo (on my alt) of the fighting republicans, i shall give thorough consideration to establishing a party platform, primary, and official slate of candidates the next time csm comes around. sorry i didn't think of it before."
5/6/2010,"well, i'd definitely be described as a conservative, but more in a barry goldwater sort of way. so even if it costs me your vote i have to say not a fan of the palin unit.issler dainzewanting to be your next csm representative but fighting an uphill battle.."
5/6/2010,gasp!
5/6/2010,"i think ankhesentapemkah is the most palin-esque candidate out there. i still like to think of myself as one of the most qualified candidates out there: i'm very active in all areas of the game, i have realistic expectations of what the csm can do, and i am capable of compromise. i remember you from my science and industry thread, but if you are interested in my full campaign you can check it out here:"
5/6/2010,isn't sarah palin a stepford wife?
5/6/2010,"ive been playing eve for nearly two years (brief history here). for the most part im very happy with the game (or i wouldnt be playing it), but there is always room for improvement. i feel im in a great position to take ideas from the player base to ccp as part of the csm.i spend most of my time in low-security space; im happy there. there is danger lurking around every corner, but not the certain death an unaffiliated pilot might find in null-security space. i have opinions on just about every aspect of eve, but i realize that my opinions arent the only thoughts that count.if youd like to get a feel for some of my opinions, feel free to browse my blog; though ive only been writing for a couple of months now, ive put out a fair number of my opinions. i think my viewpoint is best summed up by saying id like the game to make sense (intuitive) without dropping the fun factor.if you aren't sure who to vote for, i highly recommend vote match (thanks again diedra vaal for your efforts on behalf of the csm process). if you've already been there, then you might be interested in why i gave the answers i did; if thats the case, go to this blog entry which will tell you just that.at the end of the day, the csm is not really here to push their own agenda  they must look to the player base and make sure that what theyre bringing to ccp is what the player base as a whole wants. but, its still useful to know what my opinions are, so you can find a general outline on my campaign page.i won't tell you to vote, because if you're reading this forum then you already care enough to vote. instead, i'll ask that you go tell all of your friends to vote."
5/6/2010,"i'm intrigued by your thoughts on criminal sec status and free travel in high sec--especially assuming that nothing changes about the fact that once aggroed, a criminal can retaliate at will against a high sec aggressor. definitely some great pvp opportunities there. i wonder what ccp's original thinking was wrt restricting travel based on sec status.not your idea would reduce the use of alts, though. many alts have highly specialized skills so they can do one support job well--such as with my alt that flies a jump freighter. seems it would be impractical most of the time to train the skills on one's main that are necessary to do stuff currently done by an alt. for example, i'd never deviate from a pvp based skill plan to invest in the skills needed to fly a jf. mission-related skills might be more compatible, but then i don't run missions so i don't have a clue.still...intriguing ideas from a ""more pvp"" perspective! good luck with your campaign."
5/6/2010,"i assumed that as well; perhaps i should have stated it. i'm not looking for easy kills against pirates and other miscreants. in fact, i think often it will be the other way around -- a do-gooder will engage thinking it's a simple kill and lose his ship for his troubles.completely agreed there; the intent is not to have criminals running around in jump freighters, rather it was to have criminals thinking, ""it's only two jumps into high-sec to pick up that shiny battleship and fittings, i can survive that,"" much like any other player might feel about low-security space. the biggest difference being that criminals fly around low-security space all the time so they're used to it.i challenge anybody to explain how it is fun that criminals are chased through high-security space by faction navy spawns. let players perform that function -- it'll be less of a certainty, which i think makes the game more fun for all concerned.thanks for the luck; i think i'll need it with so many other great choices."
5/6/2010,"it seems ccp have now implemented this ironically, it was you when i last visited the page"
5/6/2010,glad to see ccp was listening! mazz did you call your iceland hookups? ;)
5/6/2010,"yip, looks like the whining got something changed. maybe the csm has some sway after all."
5/6/2010,wow....nice mudslinging thread.
5/6/2010,"i agree! while you're here, do you want to go and answer the questions that were posed to you about saying one thing and meaning another? or are we just twisting your words?"
5/6/2010,yay its fixednothing gets stuff done like a good old forum whine
5/6/2010,"i just noticed that csm candidates are now listed in random order, different each time the candidates page is viewed, rather than is the fixed sequence based on when they submitted their apps. this is good. thanks for addressing the concerns, ccp!"
5/6/2010,"i feel your pain. and it is even worse for me since i would fly scorpions, rooks, and falcons. oh how i miss the days when my falcon could jam at over 200+ km which meant i had time to warp out before they tackled me."
5/6/2010,let me just slip this onto your desk...looks like someone's full of it.
5/6/2010,"somebody just wants free trips to iceland?to be fair, i'd do it too"
5/6/2010,is there anywhere i can look at a picture of the csm candidates?

5/6/2010,"what do you think of my proposal? while i don't thik that mine will be the best solution ever to the problem, i am pretty confident that my analysis is right and it consider the central problem of the current mechanics.i hope that you read it.i think that in your proposal it's not clear who can see who, and which rules will decide the players i will see and the players that will see me. i also consider it a bit strange: this will limit the data that will be sent to the client, but it's not clear if this is the problem (it's a server side problem right?). if someone is interested i can make a better presentation of my sov proposal, describing some possible scenarios."
5/6/2010,"i agree that there is an engagement size ""epic"" limit -- extra people over that size don't increase the ""epicness"" significantly. if you can have fleets of that size, with minimal lag, everyone gets to eat epic cake.i think the effect you want would actually be a consequence of game mechanic that put practical upper bounds on fleet size - the best use for manpower would be attacking multiple targets at once.whether specific sov-mechanic changes will also be needed to encourage this behavior is deeply unclear, but the mechanic change that was suggested that i found most interesting was moving the sbus to the other side of the gates. the whole point was that it is the concept of visibility limitation that needs to be explored. the rule might be as simple as ""you can see the closest n ships, whatever they might be"", or it might be significantly more subtle. whatever the devs decide to try can be done as a filter in the client.as for lag being a server-side problem, sure, but consider that the server has to do two things: it has to update the game state (compute), and then communicate that info to the players (i/o). both can get bogged down, and reducing the amount of i/o means both more resources for compute, and the potential for optimizations that reduce the overall compute load.and even if this turns out not to be the case, the fact that you won't have thousands of players on the same node -- or the same grid -- can only help reduce the lag.i for one would be interested. go for it."
5/6/2010,"i also live in low-security space nearly full-time (me and my alt -- in different areas of low-security space). i don't run high-sec missions, they bore me. i imagine that they bore a lot of people.part of the problem with eve is that everybody wants to be a pirate. yo ho ho, it's a pirate's life for me. that's all well and good, but not everybody can be a predator. or, more accurately, if everybody is a successful low-sec predator nobody will go to low-sec.the solution will be multi-faceted; i think several people have already hit at the core bits: increase potential low-sec activities, make those activities exclusive to low-sec and offer decent rewards for the risk of moving about in low-security space.but, one bit nobody has mentioned is giving anti-pirates the tools necessary to accomplish their jobs. one of these factors is to make criminals really criminals (not part-time criminals with alts to do all their ""clean"" work). i'm not proposing that we attempt to discourage the use of alts, but i think there are definitely steps we could take to encourage the use of your main (or, more accurately, remove some of the absolute discouragements). i fly around in small ships and i'd gladly engage a criminal on the gate if i knew the gate guns weren't going to smear my guts all over the floor (along with my glory).i've explained my view on this issue in my blog, so i won't rehash it here; but thrust is to make criminality (piracy) a choice with consequences and the two main points are: 1) don't chase criminals around with faction navy spawns in high-sec -- let them go where they like; and 2) make it much harder to regain lost security status -- either by requiring payment of fines or some long-term commitment to ""goodness"". i think the end result will be more flashy reds flying around (even in high-security space) and more anti-pirates flying around looking for them; that's going to lead to an increase in the sense of security for some and maybe a better low-sec population.my platform is essentially the filtered opinions of eve players (not only forum dwellers; i'm here quite often myself but we're the minority and we have to realize that); but my opinions (which will obviously have some direct relation to the filtering) can be found on my campaign page."
5/6/2010,you might want to take a look at my thread1. fix the lag!2. pirating need some love3. fix lowsec4. bountyhunting on pirates5. make lowsec more attracting for miners/industrialists to be in (megacyte in small amounts)6. to compensate the 'love' for pirates the suicide ganking insurance payout will be reduced when concord is on the killmail.
5/6/2010,"mynxee you have my vote.first, i have lived in low-sec for the majority of my eve life and will only vote for people who have done the same. with that said, i agree with outlaw only fixes. low-sec already has a well define role. pvp training ground. we need a reward system that will encourage low-sec pvp and give out massive rewards for doing so. (all low-sec pilots know that tanking that extra 400 dps needs to be worth a little bit more than just a broken killmail with 0 damage done some times) ideas like bounty hunting missions from npc agents are excellent; biomass reprocessing for reclaiming implants. ideas such as these that encourage pvp need to be used to balance the risk to reward in low-sec and i believe that you feel the same way!"

5/6/2010,isn't cat a dude irl?
5/6/2010,"when i did the vote-match as a ""player"" i was pleased to see that ""mynxee"" was my top match (one would hope so!!!) but surprised at how close the next 6 or 7 candidates were...all within a couple % of each other. i tend to agree that perhaps the question pool lacks sufficient ""opposite end of spectrum"" variance to clearly differentiate candidates. however, it is a fact that many of the candidates do care about similar things--low sec revitalization, pvp balance, and ui fixes, for example. if you look at their position for the various questions, and their ""important"" question, it's obvious there is more agreement than not regarding the answers.perhaps this time, we'll end up with a csm that is fairly well on the same page, open-minded, and highly synergistic. might be a very interesting situation in a csm-as-stakeholder situation."
5/6/2010,"with 53 candidates and only 30 questions, it's hard to find a lot of differentiation. but i think the vote match site is a great stepping stone on the way to determining who you want to vote for; there's a link to each candidate's page which will give more detailed information than any survey could give you.also, if there are issues that you really care about, you will probably find that one of the top candidates is a closer match in that area than the others.so many good candidates ... so hard to choose (well, i have it easy, i have to vote for myself)."

5/7/2010,"i can fly one, but still haven't bought one. partly because of the fact that the ships statistics and bonuses are confused and not very relevant to the ships' roles. they just don't seem very good, and they are so rarely used other than just bridging a cloaky gang."
5/7/2010,"trained for it, bought it and sold it as quick as hell."
5/7/2010,do not support covert ops cloaking on black ops. it's pretty obvious if ccp gives it covops cloak dps will but cut in half. this ships needs other useful boosts with it's role.
5/7/2010,/signedtotally agree the new effect is weak and lacks the coolness the old one gave capital ships.

5/7/2010,supported
5/7/2010,supported. this is simple common sense.
5/7/2010,"privateer complaining about neutral rr alts. oh, the irony. but nonetheless, op is right. supported."
5/7/2010,"poor little privateers. getting owned 5v1 cause a neutral repped then lone pilot who privs were trying to gank. look at them bitter, bitter tears.not supported."
5/7/2010,if you're having problems tracking equivalent sized targets with blasters then you might want to stop fitting afterburners to your megathrons and orbiting at 200m. it would probably help.giving blasters more tracking doesn't really do much for them. people who regularly experience tracking issues vs similar sized targets just need to learn how to play tbfh. boosting tracking wouldn't do much to adress the part where blasters get owned by preety much all weapon systems when we discuss similar-sized ships with realistic fits.preety much.
5/7/2010,oh! that is why goumindong creates posts in blaster and rail threads. saying that hybrid weapon is ok he protects lasers from hybrid boost it is smart
5/7/2010,"well, assuming that- ccp is damage phobic- blasters should not get more range/falloff, keep them in a short range niche (and weapon types varied)- blasters should not get a huge buff to tracking, so we don't bbq frigates left right and centerhow about lowering the fitting requirements on blasters and/or increasing the pg and cpu of blaster ships? make blasters similar to autocannons - e.g. the thorax would be able to fit ion blasters with a 1600 plate + mwd much like the rupture can fit 220's + 1600 plate + mwd.the above would - be a practical increase in dps to blasters (fitting larger guns = more dps)- effectively increase the tank on the slow blasters ships as they get into range (due to fitting room)- keep blasters with their current flavour, and weapons in their current nichesall without increasing the paper dps of blaster ships beyond what they can do now, keeping ccp happy with their numbers."
5/7/2010,"someone actually understood what i said. the problem with blasters lies in the speed to fire range ratio, not in eft numbers.i'm but a humble alt, but can we please just ignore nightmarex and goumindong from now on, i mean the first one only has a bare minimum of knowledge to fly her tempest in 0.0 bs fleets and the other only flies amarr in gangs. i'm here, cause i'd like to read about good ideas for fixing blaster problerms we could present to the csm and all i can find is this impotent eft bullsh*t and really weak theorycrafting. it makes me want to slit my wrists."
5/7/2010,"so i take it you would argue against increasing the speed, agility, and scan res, while reducing the signature of gallente blaster boats?"
5/7/2010,"as long you can't counter attack or just counter on what i have said earlier, then you can't say that you all can ignore me or goum, because what we have said it the fact.and it's absolutely a fact if no one can counter argument it to not be true.and also, it doesn't take long time to fully understand how all of the weapons work ingame. and not only that, but when it's about blasters, then i know what i'm talking about. because when you have used blasters and the other weapon types on sisi for about 4-5 years, then i think i know how they work.and you also say that i have minimum of knowledge to fly a tempest. lol, is that a joke or?.i'll just wait for the argument that i don't have many kills so i don't know much about the weapon types."
5/7/2010,"at first glance i see that you did nothing to calculate or account for cap requirements , powergrid and cpu requirements , ammo usage , tracking and damage types and ships that use those types of weapons ... therefor i cant see this viable statistics at all."
5/7/2010,"well, i'm not really the greatest mathematician around, so, i can't factor in everything that there is about guns in a simple ratio. also, i only really chose to create a dps/range ratio, because the rest of the attributes are simply irrelevant in medium/large fleet engagements. feel free to come up with better numbers."
5/7/2010,"honestly have not gotten a chance to freshen up on the entirety of the thread however i think this statement pretty much sums up the most reasonable solution to the issue as a whole.i do not think that the issue lies in blasters inherently. the issue lies in the usage of blasters not specificly their individual stats as a module compared to other weapon types of ""similar"" ranges. i think that the entire line of blaster oriented ships needs to be re-evaluated and have their sig, speed, and agility revamped to allow them to expand their engagement envelope w/o overpowering their primary weapon system compared to other races comparable weapons. some minor slot changes/additions may potentially be needed as well, entirely another debate though."
5/7/2010,"walls of text and lots of arguing on semantics itt but when i fly blasterships in game they seem perfectly fine as close range damage dealers, which is their purpose, so not supported."
5/7/2010,"so to recap;people aren't fond of the idea of increasing blaster tracking because that will result in little, if any, practical change in their performance.a straight damage boost is desirable, if only to give us a reason to fit and use them over pulse lasers, however ccp are very leery about allowing fits to top the 1200 dps 'cap' that seems to exist on most all-gank bs configurations.a range increase would turn blasters into autocannons or pulses.a tracking bonus on all blaster hulls isn't desirable because it would result in all blaster boats having less flavor and secondly a tracking boost would not be helpful.reducing blaster fitting requirements is a neat idea but does ccp really want the kind of monstrous ehp coupled with a full rack of neutron blaster ii's? i doubt it (despite that being the whole gallente combat ethos, apparently)adding 'special effects' such as shield/armor piercing attributes probably isn't doable because the game code isn't smart enough to handle it at this point.adding a third damage type, or even giving them a fixed omni-damage spectrum.. well, i haven't actually heard anyone refute that idea.generally speaking it seems to me like the whole combat doctrine ccp wrote for the gallente faction is a bad afterthought, something they were grubbing around for late at night when they'd already worked out what all the other factions were going to be after they realized ""drones drones and more drones"" weren't a realistic goal given the technical constraints they had to work within. then they tried forcing this square peg into the round hole of the game mechanics and guess what? it didn't work."
5/7/2010,"well, after carefully pondering this topic, i cannot support an across the board buff to hybrid weapons in general, and blasters specifically. what is needed is a total rethink of the gallente race. their speed is atrocious for the weapons they favor. gallente are supposed to be the jason voorhes, of eve, instead we get star wars kid."
5/7/2010,"why just gallente , blasters are as much caldari weapons as gallente."
5/7/2010,"no, blasters are not ""just as much"" a caldari weapon, rails are a caldari weapon. caldari are fine, and before you go blubbering on about how rails need a boost, and the rohks dps sucks, consider this. caldari fit their ""style"" of warfare. they are optimized for sniping at long range, and rails compliment their ""style"". gallente ""style"" is to bash you over the head with a big hammer. you can't do that in ships that are the second slowest in the universe, yet if you fit them for speed you basically are made of glass. i can understand where ccp wanted to go with the concept of gallente, their execution of it has fallen flat. i don't know maybe a 5% bonus to ab/mwd speed boost per level, instead of a rof bonus."
5/7/2010,"wow 10 pages , have ccp even acknowledge that there is a problem with hybrid/gallente ??i have been watching this thred since it started and it seem like its just been ignored by ccp and the csm"
5/7/2010,gallente were supposed to be big drone boats with close range dps to compliment. then drones were nerfed. then they were nerfed again. then blasters were nerfed. now gallente suck because they were over-nerfed.the problem with rails is specifically gallente. rails on gallente ships don't have the range to account for the low dps. the problem with blasters is specifically gallente. they have a major range deficit for a small dps increase.
5/7/2010,about time they got fixed
5/7/2010,"lol sure , caldari for sniping is fine ,in your dreams maybe.amarr does it much better. there is hardly any reason to do less than acceptable dmg at longer ranges than the other races."
5/7/2010,"fine, if lasers are better, then fit lasers on your rohk. simple have fun burning out t2 laser crystals trying to shoot past 180km when a rohk with rails can get there with non t2 ammo.seriously, ccp has caved on issues of power creep by whines such as this for far to long. as it stands now amarr and minmatar weapons are ballanced. since hybrids are two races weapons, simply buffing all hybrids will cause balance issues between two races.edit: one buff with twice the headache, balancing it all later."
5/7/2010,"... and bringing the discussion back to fixing blasters, which is a far easier discussion than how to fix rails. blasters need:1. easier fitting so the ships can fit more tank.2. faster ships.3. more damage.4. more range.pick one or make some combination that brings them to balance with the other weapons in the game."
5/7/2010,that would be my pick.
5/7/2010,"well 1. and 3. are out, since that will buff blaster caldari ships too, and 4. will just make it like auto cannons(and another stealth buff for caldari, with their range bouni). that leaves only, faster ships, as the buff for gallente, according to your list."
5/7/2010,"see, this is why i think its so funny that i am attacked. in that thing that i keep pointing you all towards, this is what i have to say on the issuespecifically i think the thorax should be one of the fastest and most agile cruisers, the brutix should be brought up to teir 2 quality, the hyperion made one of the fastest and most agile battleships, and the deimos be made into an even more specialized thorax(2000m/s, 105 sig, 7.5s/align w/ mdw)but all that you folks see is ""boost their damage""... their damage and hit points really is not the problem. i mean, for goodness sakes, right now, you can make a 28k ehp thorax with 550 dps. that is strictly better than a 220 gank rupture(500 dps 27k ehp). the only problem is that the damned thorax can't ever get in range of anything to kill it."
5/7/2010,"wait, who puts blasters on caldari ships? and who worries about caldari blaster fits being over powered? hybrid caldari ships get a range bonus and no tracking bonus and these amount to next to nothing when range starts at only a few km and tracking is an issue at that range. even if you reduce the fitting requirements and increase the damage, no one in their right mind would put blasters on a caldari ship if they can fly a gallente ship.@ goum: like i said, you had some good ideas."
5/7/2010,"awsome goumindong, seems i see eye to eye with someone at last even if i'm opening myself into a flame target.i think we should diagnose the primary problem ships and attempt to propose some non radical ideas to get the ball rolling on the blatant issue. now i don't agree with all the stat changes that were posted in your ship revamp however i think there are many good ideas presented in it none the less.so i'm going to try and propose some very simple changes, let me know if you agree or disagree.thorax: +speed, -mass, - sig the thorax is in itself a great ship as goumindong pointed out when looking at raw stats however i do not think that it has the baseline ship stats needed to allow it to perform as intended.deimos: + cap, - sig not even going to get started with this one. we all know it's broke time to fix asap.brutix: -sig, + speed, +100 grid, +1 high slot, change all active tanking bonuses to 10% now the brutix is not a bad ship, don't get me wrong here guys. the issue i have with the brutix is that it's most effective fitting does not even take advantage of it's repping bonus.. now the idea behind the added grid and high slot is i'm sure no surprise to anyone with half a brain. lets get a gang mod + full rack of guns please!astarte: -sig, +speed, +high slot, mirrior 10% rep bonus change from brutix. just like the deimos, i'm lost on how to make this an expensive low ehp ship good at close range combat however i've tried to at least make it viable in very small scale gangs. reason for the high is the same as the brutix, guns + gang mod please!now having far less bs fleet experiance i'm going to leave both the hyperion and the mega up to the more experianced posters. i will say that i think that after minor speed/agility tweaks and a 10% rep amount bonus the hyperion will be one hell of a small gang monsters. mega is already pretty good in my personal experiences however i'm sure there is something ""wrong"" with it.edit: almost forgot one!enyo: +cpu now i know this is not designed as just a blaster boat however i think that it could use a small amount of cpu allowing it to fit dmg mods in certain setups."
5/7/2010,i support this product and/or service.
5/7/2010,some nice ideas... supported
5/7/2010,wooh support!!!
5/7/2010,for sure signed. it has essentially killed the use of a fair few ships.
5/7/2010,maybe someone should put a... rocket... up ccp's arse on this?you see what i did there?
5/7/2010,support on each point
5/7/2010,"qualified support, subject to a few enhancements to mechanics.people and places searching for 'charactername' will match to current names and past 'alias'.using a locator agent matches present name and past 'alias'.the only strong argument against this is the clean slate for scammers argument. at the moment there is bigger exposure to a clean slate. a character is started with an offensive but obscure name. a scam is carried out. a name change is triggered by exposing the offence. there is no name history to show the scamming alias.however this proposal addresses the clean slate issue through the name history.the name history enhances game play by making due diligence more important. a rl cost is a good deterrent against abusing this feature.i'm inclined towards allowing one free name change during the newbie training period. many newbies make a poor name choice before being exposed to the games lore of what is a good character name."
5/7/2010,what made you include numbers in your name in the first place?
5/7/2010,"i can't support this idea since reputation is one of the key factors in the game.you burn your bumm you have to sit on the blisters.you made yourself a crappy name your choice. eve is a game where you have to live with your choices, good or bad.if you buy a character with a bad reputation then that is your own doing, you are not forced to buy that character.so a big no from me here."
5/7/2010,this.do not support this idea.
5/7/2010,"i support name changing since character trading is more op than changing a name. at least with just a name change you standing to that character would stay the same but when you trade a character no one really has no clue who you are. i don't see your logic in saying trading is ok but name change is wrong, anyway.i support name change if you can only change it once, this way it don't get super confusing seeing new names on characters every few weeks."
5/7/2010,nocriminals and scammers must be punished for ever
5/7/2010,do want!
5/7/2010,"showin my support!i really wish i could see what my drones are actually doing to another player, or to npc's during missions, etc. drones can deal a huge amount of damage to a someone."
5/7/2010,supporting the removal of the penalties. not so sure on the damage boost. still supported overall.
5/7/2010,"t2 short range ammo is so crap i dont think i will every use it unless it is changed, i can use 2 types of t2 guns and i think both arnt worth it, faction ammo is better."
5/7/2010,yup t2 ammo is crap
5/7/2010,"i would have to say that i disagree with this, not supported. as a minmatar pilot who uses hail, you guys are giving it a bad rap. i do more damage with hail m then i do with most faction medium ammo, and i just make up for the optimal and tracking penalties with a tracking computer and optimal projectile rig, and am still able to fit a half decent tank and other damage mods.i haven't really noticed this big difference in t2 and faction except in the higher tiered faction ammos, and even that doesn't really justify the price difference. tell you honestly, the only times i even use faction ammo is in pve, never in pvp because the cost is too muchnot supported"
5/7/2010,"you're doing it wrong. the purpose of pve is to make money, not waste it on expensive ammo. in pvp, there is a reason to use expensive ammo if it helps you kill the other guy faster than he can kill you (by doing more damage or penalizing you less).i'm curious, what range do you have with these hail ac guns? i'm assuming you are flying a vaga to be able to keep targets in range?"
5/7/2010,"i dont use faction ammo all the time in pve, just for the more difficult missions, like angel extravaganza or worlds collide, where i need the extra damage to kill stuff quick. other then that, t1 ammo suffices.as for what range i get with hail, on a vaga, i get 2 km optimal, 13 km falloff give or take, depending.edit - thats with 425mm t2 ac"

5/7/2010,"i'm me, and eight other people, and i support this topic."
5/7/2010,"ive read through the forums on macro / bot issues with several mmos and its a complicated problem. protecting the software developers ip and preserving the balance of the economy is definitely a long term issue. but inhibiting or changing the game mechanics to how players perform those tasks is not an easy pill for the player community to swallow, its a huge balancing act. offering suggestions of captchas or as another post said limiting the amount of time an account could mine (and boy i laughed so hard, i just decided it was better for me not to respond to that one), or even a report function is ripe for abuse so when you break it all down. a separate application that just scans for those programs that are specifically designed and marketed as mmo macro programs can be easily identified and added to an account ban list. more importantly the application would be separate from the actual eve client, remember the more stuff you build into a client app the more chances you have to break other stuff. a separate application minimizes any chances of something falling thru the q&a cracks and creating bugs that interfere with the overall eve gaming experience.i firmly believe that parties who are profiting off eve ip by selling macro programs will look for other mmos to target if they feel they are going to have to now fight an uphill battle. those code writers are going to walk away in lieu of trying to beat ccp, no one will keep buying apps that get accounts banned and the developers of the macro will start targeting other games instead. if im ccp and i get with the csms and say ok, were going to budget for some problem solving. im going to be looking at other mmos who did solve the problem and doing a cost analysis on that solution. why reinvent a wheel? why not go for the option that guarantees the highest probability of success. heres a different perspective, youre contributing to ccp in terms of being a subscriber. do you want them to waste your money on gimmick solutions or do you want them to spend the money on a best bet solution so in the future, they arent trying for another gimmick fix with your money, theyre spending it on improving the gaming experience. java"

5/7/2010,"there are no ways to counter this unless you want to not form large groups of friends at all. this game is supposed to be about massive multi-player yet the bomber in its current form punishes those who have more friends that those losers who fly the bombers.it is another case of those who don't have mad at those who do and have the attitude of, ""well, if i don't have (insert whatever then no one can!"""
5/7/2010,"wow, i mean wow, you must be really mad for loosing to some smart players that whooped yo ass.and not only that, but your tears are really delicious.keep crying in assembly hall. it will make assembly hall looks like a good place."
5/7/2010,"if you fail to form up in a way that bombers are not raping you, you deserved to die. but keep trying. the more you post, the more you look like a total idiot. just waiting for ""!!!111!"".i think i will donate a few bombers to the sc.adapt or die."
5/7/2010,sup'orted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111111111111111
5/7/2010,"the initiative is the guys / alliance who deserves a few bombers then.those guys needs way way more bombers, so they can fuel their bombers with millions of tons with emo tears from the nc, so the bombers have some extra fuel."
5/7/2010,"malcanis,i have some spare bombs kicking around in one my hangars - contact me in game and i'll drop them off somewhere for you.<3"
5/7/2010,throw a sniper eagle or ferox into your fleet. they'll make those bombers think twice.
5/7/2010,for a start it would help to wait inside the pos shield until the jb is fueled again. ;)
5/7/2010,"i don't support this,but would support allowing members of the same fleet to see where other cloaked assets are ."
5/7/2010,"wow, just wow. i, cant even fly these things and i know that they are the only thing to counter the blob. since the removal of aoe doomsday weapons, sb's are the only thing preventing super blobs. well that, and ccp breaking their game, so that even fleets as low as 150 can't load system."
5/7/2010,"so we are to be punished because we have more friends than they have? yeah, thats fair."
5/7/2010,"rofl, your being punished because you guys are dumb as hell.i could even train a monkey to be better in pvp than most of the guys in nc. it's that bad for you guys. and since you are in the nc, we can take you as for speaking for the whole nc, because everytime you guys in nc lose to some bombers, your off to this forum section to cry us a river with salty tears.and on top of that in assembly hall.you make nc looks worser than they are."
5/7/2010,"i think i see what the problem is.you're assuming that all combat is the same. this is not the case and not all ships are created the same. likewise, they don't all do the same thing.from a tactical standpoint, pvp is an endless game of rock-paper-scissors... some ships will be better suited for certain tasks and against certain ships, as are others.if you have the intel on what kind of ships the enemy has, you can counter by bringing in ""specialty ships"" (in this case, the stealth bomber against a large cluster of immobile battleships) that will be highly effective against them... no matter how high their numbers may be.fight smarter, not harder. just because the enemy outnumbers you it doesn't mean you can't fight back. likewise, just because you can't see an enemy it does not mean you are helpless against it (i.e. don't sit in one place)."
5/7/2010,"except forming up inside the pos shield, amirite?"
5/7/2010,again only supported due to nightmarex being a complete idiot.
5/7/2010,and emo tj is not that here?.can i ask why i'm a complete idiot here by the way?. is it because i wont support the most ******ed and stupid idea ever here in eve's history?.or maybe you shouldn't make you look as dumb as emo tj your self.
5/7/2010,because emo tj is an sc troll alt you moron.
5/7/2010,"and he have to troll sc in assembly hall?. wow, way to make assembly hall to look like a junk yard.if it haven't been assembly hall, i wouldn't care, but because assembly hall is a platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar management, then this is going waaaaay to far."
5/7/2010,"she has been voted for, so shes csm,way to get rid of her: dont vote for her,and tell others not to.personally i would never have voted for her,after her campaign, but well, the downsideof democracy is the rule by the (stupid) masses."
5/7/2010,video have been found of ankedurkadurka playing videogamesvideo
5/7/2010,why don't you go give her more publicity? is she paying you or are you her?
5/7/2010,bumping an awesome thread!
5/7/2010,"she's pretty harmless so just ignore the drivel she comes out with tbh, not like anyone listens to the csm anyway"
5/7/2010,"so pretty much all of eve players right?this is the part where she gets damned to hell right? but let's ignore the fact there is no evidence for god. after all, he must exist since nobody has proved he doesn't.kind of like pirates who whine about concord in highsec and how it is so easy to make iskies in highsec being carebears?"
5/7/2010,"removing t2 bpos won't affect the market for popular items, where t2 bpos can't produce volumes matching the market demand. however, removal will broaden access to market-based pvp for unpopular items.supported."
5/7/2010,"i understand both sides of this issue. however, i think that ultimately we have a problem where the game would be better off without them, but that they don't play enough of a role in the game to justify destroying the absolutely massive incredible investments built around them. people complain, for example, that they can't get into the t2 market because t2 bpos keep them out. however, i think it's eminently clear that there is plenty of competition for t2 modules that actually have a market to speak of to start with!imo, htfu... it's a lot easier to say ""delete the other guy's 650 billion isk!"" than it is to say to delete your own.-liang"
5/7/2010,"many people apparently don't realize that buffing invention won't make invention more profitable, it will only bring crash both market prices and cost prices. so nothing will change, margins won't be better. those margins are already good enough, to be honest."
5/7/2010,"people need to stop quoting a hack who's dropped back to doing economic break down for a computer game.saying 50% of t2 is made from bpo's means nothing because it's not in context.how many mods\ships\ammo items are there first?things like mining crystals take a ages to burn out so the demand for them is limited and bpo's will dominate that market but if the bpo holders decided to charge 50mil a crystal, the inventors would rush in and bring the price crashing down in seconds.actual, in context numbers are needed before you can call this.sostop *****ing about something that a preschool level economist is talking about.i mean, if he was good at his job then surely he'd be getting paid alot more than a videogame company could pay him.also, if he were doing both and had eve as a side project, what do you think he'd spend more time on?a game or a job that pays x hundread k a year?out of context data is irelivant it's like basing a car company around""we buy any car""so?i'll buy any car too, i'll give you <U+FFFD>500 for a perfectly working year old bently.out of context data, pay attention."
5/7/2010,oddly enough i took a bet with a friend of mine who owns a nice t2 bpo. he would build from that one and i would do the same by invention with my alt and we would see who made better profit in the course of a month.i beat him because my volume way outperformed his volume. he could build cheaper but i could mass produce due to having a lot more bpc'sso i made my profit in volume instead of by trying to get mucho isk per sale.
5/7/2010,which bpo? that makes rather a lot of difference.
5/7/2010,"this, or start reseeding t2 bpo either way is ok by me"
5/7/2010,"i'd like to see specialized probes that can scan for cloaked ships. requirements for operating these probes would be high, maybe level 5 of all current scanning skills.i think something needs to be done about afk cloakers and this would be an easy and fair solution in my opinion. cloakers that are actively seeking targets would not be affected as they are constantly moving, scanning them down would be extremely difficult if not impossible altogether. it's not fair that one person can sit in a system 23 hours of the day without any way for the others in that system to chase him off or kill him."
5/7/2010,dont fix what aint broken.
5/7/2010,"this is not a terrible idea, but a better solution is something that we already have: directional scanner. don't let someone afk cloaked in system bother you. just watch your d-scan for anything that worries you.if one or two people cloaked in system bothers you, you might not need to be in that system to begin with."
5/7/2010,"yes, and once he doesn't just sit there you can kill him, what is the problem then?he either can't do anything or you can kill him, seems fair.if you're afraid to undock with anything non-blue in local that is your problem"
5/7/2010,"not supportedcloakers who sit in system are used for intel, so just because they aren't talking in local doesn't mean they're afk. if you're doing a mining op, mission op, or hunting fir juicy targets in 0.0, having guys who can lag behind and provide intel in system is an asset and they can be popped as soon as they start moving around if they're not somewhat carefulnot supported"
5/7/2010,not supported.
5/7/2010,stil a issue
5/7/2010,"carebear here. you sir, are an insult to us. just stop. the profit scale should go 0.0>low>high. not highhighhighhighhighhigh!"
5/7/2010,"useless? my pos would disagree with you, if it could speak."
5/7/2010,"i don't see this as an entirely bad thing being able to mine moons in empire for low level moon materials, would break some of the monopoly of the 0.0 corps, maybe drop some prices for the manufactures. jump bridges idea may not work, but i am not against it either.if you can have moon harvesting arrays then you would also need reactor arrays in empire, but there would defiantly be a few issues around that, but there maybe a way of working round that, e.g. limiting types of reaction.i don't see this as trying to bring 0.0 to empire, just something that should have been in the game anyway, pilots/corporations, spend a lot of time and isk to earn the ability to deploy towers in empire, should have some benefits to that, than just being able to deploy labs and factories. plus this might also mean there could be a reason to improve the moon mineral types in 0.0 and increase the amounts of the r32 and r64 moons."
5/7/2010,"go play on the test server... technically you won't be risking anything in ""unsafe space""... not that there is any such thing as ""safe"" space in eve in the first place..."
5/7/2010,"if your stupid enough to haul pos's in t1 industrials whilst on autopilot then you don't deserve pos's.contradicting yourself epically there lol.plus, i thought you had to be in a 'real' corp to anchor a pos :p ^you clearly have no idea of the isk making capabilities of hisec pos's......... so don't go off asking for a full blown economy destroying change before you know what you are talking about."
5/7/2010,"i was just thinking the same thing.also, not supported. if you want risk free isk, go run level 4s."
5/7/2010,"yes, that's right. another one of those threads.what i'm gonna try and say tho, is something i hope the majority will find beneficial rather than gamebreaking/changing. basicly, as it stands now, ecm is the singly ewar that will render any ship, any time, completely harmless. there is two ways around it, assigning drones to someone with weaponry, or having friedn or foe missiles in a missile boat. both of which are valid workarounds and should honestly be utilize more. however, if you're in a ""pure"" turret ship, as most bs's are to name one type, this is very seldom an option.what i would like the ecm modules to do instead of the 20 second cycle, is to mess with your targeting computer in a very different way. ecm bursts are what i am looking at. having a target unable to activly defend itself alone, or shut down x% of any hostile fleets for a minimum of 20 seconds (assuming you don't warp/die) can be the changer of the battle. in fact, in most cases, assuming you're on near equal grounds it will be.now, for the change i would like. ecm should still be mesing with your targeting computer. and it should still be chance based. what i would like it to do instead of a 20 sec cycle, would be to act as a focused ecm burst. basicly, you may or may not lose lock, but that's all it does. you will be forced to reacquire lock every time it gets a successful ""hit"". now, the specifics behind this would of course be worked out with someone that knows how to make this happen, the simple change i would would be as follows:either a very short, or no cycle time at all, basicly just an on off switch, or maybe a 5 sec cycle timeno longer be ""jammed"" but lose lock as an effect of the modulestill be chance based depending on module strenght relative to the target ship, and falloffwhat the stated should then do, is make it so that you may lose lock 3 times within a time period of 5 sec, but you can always reacquire lock (it may break your lock while locking) and thus never be ""permajammed"". it can also go 10 minutes passed without losing lock a single time. basicly the same with the jammers now, but the consequence is of a less degree. this will enable a ecm ship (like the falcon) to still be able to get away from a single, and even multiple tacklers if lucky, and it can still disrupt a hostile fleet and save other pilots. it will however not make it so that a gang of a ecm ship+one or two dps ship can kill anything in it's path without getting shot back.so in essence the ecm modules would be ""unchanged"" in the manner that they will still ""jam"" people, but only to a certain extent. this will also make it so that all ecm modules in the game currently does the same job (ecm burst and lock breaker bombs).i will specify that the effect of the ecm module would not be ""once per cycle"" but ""as long as the module is active"". basicly you target someones targeting computer, and you continiously try to jam it's signals. and since the targeting computer is changing, every once in a while, you get a match and jam it. this is why it should have either a very short cycle time, or no cycle time at all. this would enable you to activly try and disrupt a large number of people in a short ammount of time, making it in effect, a very long range ecm burst. a skilled pilot could then jam a key portion of a fleet very fast, and over and over again. depending on the efficiency on the module, one may also suggest that the jam should become stronger the more time passes. having your ecm module sync with the target ships targeting computer so to say. have enough time pass, and you may get near the old ""20 sec jammed cycle"" in the way your opponent will lose lock more often. this is more complicated however and may not be possible.i've spoken to several ecm pilots about this (i'm falcon etc capable too) and it's only been well recieved so far. in my eyes, this would benefit more than harm. thank you."
5/7/2010,agree
5/7/2010,"i support this in principle, just don't remove them completely.a) goodb) goodc) half good - i like the pos management window idea, but not complete removal of the mails.they do serve a purpose and are useful, but a little over the top right now."
5/7/2010,"i herby call into question the voting for the cms 5. my application was submitted well in time and my credntials were sent as asked for yet my name in not included in the vote. why not? is it because the same ole same ole group of people don't want to share? there were nymerous questions and statements from players in the forfum that there was no point in running since it was either a) allready a done deal with the same people running things and or b) it didn't matter anyway since ccp simply used the csm as a smoke screen and or ignored them totally. is it because i ""rocked the boat""? by asking questions in the forum that no one would answer escpecially csm. i asked repeatedly if application was accepted and was repeatedly ignored. now without any preamble there is a vote with no debate no notice no nothing. one little msg when you sign on that says vote but for what? why should they when you have gone out of your way to make csm and the entire process hard to find and follow. so once again the majority will be trampled by the minority and given no choice in how the game is played? i wonder if anyone looked into the board of ccp if they would see **** cheney and bush running the show. this is their style of politics. frankly i never even dreamed anyone but myself would vote for me in the first place but to not even have my name listed is the lowest form of censourship there is and after reading and particapating in the forums it ptoves the contemp the old school csm and ccp has for anything or anyone new and the players of eve in general. their motto should be ""just give us your money to play the game and shut the hell up, we could care less what you think"".fly safely fly freeelf lord"
5/7/2010,um.you did see that part where it said they rejected 9 applications right?
5/7/2010,so this would be like an aoe version of the new dd for blobbed titans. cool.
5/7/2010,combine these two events togheter: multiple and low signature res.
5/7/2010,"so, 30bs can go mwd to a group of caps with no weapons and suicide and effecivly kill them all or make them worthless for a bit... yea"
5/7/2010,"this idea is so horrifically, mind numbingly, heap of offal, bad i just don't know where to begin."
5/7/2010,"if stuff getting blown up counts as consumption then everything in the game can be consumed. bpo's, data interfaces, anything.in null sec exploration has become the equivalent of lvl 4's except they make more money than 4's. not the incorrect estimate of 40m an hour lvl 4's but i have heard some absurd figures coming out of null about how much they were making in exploration(not wh). i have only done it in high sec and it was fun but didn't pay as much as running through 4's with two vargurs as you can imagine.one friend claimed over 100m an hour though i think that was exaggerating a lot. a full time explorer i know does claim to make in excess of 40m an hour down there though and that i believe."
5/7/2010,supported.i really think they need to take a look at balancing the whole exploring subset now that the dust has settled.
5/7/2010,"hello. i have an idea for u ppl of eve. well, the server 'tranquility' has been down far past its downtime. it says its had an error. well, thats kind of messed up becuase, there is no other servers?! i mean come on. all games like this should have a backup server.i mean, thats kinda pathectic. (not to be mean to the creators)if it was possible, i think it would be a good thing to copy 'tranquility' and make a backup server. a backup wouldent be bad,just in case of this exended downtime. and something else to, only allow connections to it if the server 'tranquility' is having an exteded downtime. just so players like us are not waiting. i dont mind if they raise the downtime a little, just keep at least one of them working"
5/7/2010,first of all ... nobody has a few hundred servers just spare.for the rest of the time.
5/7/2010,"plus, extended downtime means they're fixing something. if it was broken on one server, it would be broken on the backup server as well. plus, mirroring would be silly hard to do. ccp isn't run by magic pixies after all."
5/7/2010,"you make me sad... i mean come on, get back to school, before you start touching keyboard... there may be still some hope left.(you probably think eve ""server"" is some desktop machine ?)"
5/7/2010,"the no-local thing i have heard of. insta-warp and warp-to-cloaked-ship - those two i am not familiar with, but they do sound quite interesting. do they actually exist? can anyone explain a little bit about them? maybe one of the numerous pl pilots in this thread?on topic - it doesn't really matter how many people support the idea of stripping pl of their championship title - ccp is not gonna do that. it would be nice to see some bans, but that's not gonna happen either. it appears that the ""big banhammer"" is just a cool toy that devs like to swing around in their videos. btw, has there been any kind of official response from ccp about those exploits?the thing i am really curious about is this - why do the ""best pvp-ers"" in eve, the pilots who won the alliance tournament for 2 years in a row, need to use exploits to fight their opponents? anyone?"
5/7/2010,support this i do
5/7/2010,oh yes!/signed
5/7/2010,"i find it contradictory that a large ship with plenty of room for robust electronics, such as a battleship, takes longer to lock onto a target than a smaller ship, such as a frigate. i do understand that larger ships have substantially greater locking range, but this trade off is a poor mimic of real world electronic targeting. i think applying an inverse square law, or dampened variant, to the targeting game mechanics is worth consideration."
5/7/2010,imho it makes perfect sense from the game balance stand point.it gives smaller ships a role. (why would you bring any small ship if all big ships can lock just as fast?)not supported.
5/7/2010,tracking speed
5/7/2010,"that doesnt matter for:- e-war of all kind- killing at rangethink about insta locking bs with long range points and heavy neuts. good luck in trying to outrun that.if you need fast locking. fit your ship/gang for it.remote sensor boosting, target painting from frigates (helps your bigger ships to lock faster)you are not very convincing on why we should give up that balance."
5/7/2010,"what i mean by ""inverse square law"" is that range from a target influences targeting speed. the math can be dampened to prevent instalocks at pointblank range.neuts and e-war fits on a bs have drawbacks. fitting a neut can impede overall firepower and fitting e-war, or a point and web, replaces cap boosters, an mwd or ab, sensor boosters and or tracking computers. the cpu demand of the e-war can further inconvenience a battleship's fit.you didn't mention drones?a frigate or cruiser engaging a battleship should be at risk - it's a battleship. the current targeting mechanics are more imbalanced against the ship that can exceed 100 million isk as opposed to one that costs a few million or only a few hundred thousand. also consider the skill requirements to fit and fly the relative ships.the introduction of a flak cannon module would be an imbalance, and drive the frigate into obsolescence."
5/7/2010,it would make sense but it will screw the game balance.
5/7/2010,"tracks faster than this and sits on a bigger platform than the smaller gun, and can fire much further as well. (video of it tracking) a big vehicle is easier to find than a smaller vehicle. hence, real life example is similar to the in-game simulation.remember, we're talking about a sensor locking and tracking a target 100m across traveling 5,000+ m/s or 18,000+ kmh or 11,000+ mph at a range of 50-249km in a vacuum. the smaller and faster the object in space, the harder it is to track with a sensor."
5/7/2010,"""it would make sense but it will screw the game balance."" -dxyocwhat you say is a contradiction. if it makes sense, how can it screw the game balance? i have made a few points why i think the current targeting mechanics are imbalanced and unduly favor smaller ships.you didn't make an argument. how would such a change influence ""game balance""? and how would those changes relate to some of my points? i think on this issue, game targeting mechanics, the current ""game balance"" is an unfounded preconception."
5/7/2010,"it does not contradict at all.from a realisms perspective bigger ships should lock faster , but due to game ballance they lock slower than smaller ships.no reason to change that cause atm they work well.its not like i want to wait 2 years after they chage targeting speeds just to fix balance.and i can't see any point except the reaslism one."
5/7/2010,"bagehi, that bigger platform doesn't fly.as for your point about tracking, norad can track an object the size of a baseball in orbit and you're telling me that tracking a ""larger"" object, 100m across, a few hundred kilometers away with a spaceship of fantastically advanced technology, 20,000+ years into the future, is a challenge?i do understand your point about real world analogies not fitting with the simulation, but i do think i am made my point from the perspective of the simulation and basic physics. it's such an artificially imposed tactical advantage that it bugs the **** out of me - it's really starting to hinder my suspension of disbelief."
5/7/2010,if you think this is bad contemplate how a target 500m2 is just as easy to hit at 0m as it is at 250km.it's a balance mechanic and a **** poor one at that but it is what it is. i actually like what your concept is about the inverse targeting speed but fixing that and things like signature radius simply are not going to happen because it would fundamentally alter eve to it's very core. even though things like this would fix a hell of a lot of eve's problems it's not really an issue.
5/7/2010,i'ts....i'ts just a game man.lots of stuff is unrealistic but good from a balance pov.
5/7/2010,"you're trying to say a flying aircraft carrier would be harder to find than one floating in water?i think you misunderstand how they ""track"" orbiting junk. because it is something small, like a satellite or orbiting vehicle that identifies the stuff (often by chance), plots its course, then tells a place on the planet where to find it to get exact readings on where it is going, thereafter a computer simply crunches numbers and they will occasionally recheck to see if it is where it is projected to be (if it isn't, it is ""lost""). there's tons of stuff up there not being tracked. in fact, fairly large asteroids have near misses and hit our atmosphere without first being acquired. again, these are all things with predictable trajectories.so, here again, something small is required to find something small in space. if it changes course (like a small spaceship would) something far away would lose its lock. in reality, allowing large ships to keep locks on small things at extreme ranges, despite course changes, is letting them off easy.radar doesn't work in space, because there is no medium to transmit sound waves. you have to find them through emissions and/or reflections.a more accurate simulation would increase the difficulty of locking and maintaining lock based on distance, changes in velocity, and distance from an emission source that would reflect off it. however, the more variables there are, the more load there is on the servers. i would prefer to be able to fight a bunch of ships than have a more accurate acquisition and tracking model that crashed the servers."
5/7/2010,"bagehi, i didn't know you wrote code for ccp.""radar doesn't work in space, because there is no medium to transmit sound waves. you have to find them through emissions and/or reflections."" - bagehi... no wonder its ****ed up. radar and sound waves - that is pretty funny.all the variables that would be used to crunch targeting figures are already used in every other aspect involved in resolving combat, what's one more calculation.... can i interest you in a wafer thin mint?"
5/7/2010,"radar = sound waves, not radio detection and ranging? what???bagehi, uninstall eve. now!and don't ever post here again!"
5/7/2010,"i believe that faction ships and items (officer too) should be able to be bought and sold on the open market for two main reasons.1: this would give price averages and other valuable data to sellers and buyers.2: it would help immensely to cut down contract and trade scamming. the vast majority of scams you will see in jita local are people protending something is the faction version, (i.e. navy caracal is a caracal, rigged navy raven being a regular raven covered in capacitor control circuits and modules) however the market system cannot be fooled in this way.thank you for taking the time to read my first proposal."
5/7/2010,supportedhell i think the entire trade system should be done under the open market
5/7/2010,"not supported.i rather like the ability to check prices in entire space with contracts (we are talking about expensive and generally quite rare stuff), plus i think there's nothing wrong with scamming given how silly you have to be to fall for a scam of that sort."
5/7/2010,"nothing wrong with scamming, but all items should be on the market. /signed"
5/7/2010,"it allows people to check prices (and/or find the best place to buy them) throughout eve for rare items. regardless of whether or not this was intended, this is an extremely good reason to not want faction ships on the normal market."
5/7/2010,"if i'm reading your post right, what you care most about is the ability to see price history and volumes of sold items; i think this is important information -- but i'm not sure that changing contract items to market items is the best idea.the market is good because you have a nice orderly way of finding everything; most things are on the market and so generally you find what you want. you also get the benefit of being able to see price history and volume of sales for predefined periods.contracts are great because you can see them no matter where in new eden your pilot happens to be. you also have a handy history of what contracts you've been involved with.your proposal will suffer from a couple of issues; one is that people will complain that it will be difficult to find rare items and get any kind of reasonable price comparison without visiting every region. the second is that scammers feel they have a right to screw you over. i'm not arguing the rightness or wrongness of these objections. i'm suggesting that you change your proposal.i'd rather see a price history and volume of sales for single-item contracts. i think single-item contracts ought to be merged with the market window somehow so that you can find items using the efficient market view and see a price history and sales volume. this would keep the benefits and dangers of contracts but allow contracts to benefit from the positive side of the market view.i like where you were going with this, but at this point the cons outweigh pros."
5/7/2010,"but at the same time allow players to freely join any npc corp they wishthe cost for wardeccing an npc corp should increase and you wont be allowed to go near that corps property (stations etc) or you will get attacked.as for new players, stick them in a concorde alliance which is immune to wardecs and just force a player to join another npc corp after 2 months"
5/7/2010,"no.provide more and better game mechanics that facilitate more pvp instead.tradable kill rights, vigilante forces, formalizing mercenary contracts, adding meaning to wardecs by adding victory conditions and demands..."
5/7/2010,"no.even from just a story perspective, that's the equivalent of declaring war on one of the major factions. and i'm sure they would have no problems with hunting you down or gathering the resources to grind what ever assets you have into dust.and that's before you get into the game play side...so don't go there. trust me."
5/7/2010,"alts have for too long continued to evade death, if people feel this to be an issue they should join a real corp and defend themselves.this isnt about hunting people it is about equal pvp and it is exploiting game mechanics when a person leaves a corp to a noobie corp just to evade a wardec"
5/7/2010,"bad idea, it would end with multiple war decks against the starter npc corps and 2 day old players wondering why people can shoot them and concord does nothing.npc taxes were introduced to encourage alts out of npc corps, i'd suggest looking at a means of extending this to include miners, industrialists and traders if you really think there is a problem.personally i don't see a problem with people being immune to war decs. i don't think much of the war dec mechanic perhaps we should look at alternatives."
5/7/2010,"actually, corps are allowed to join the militias that are at war with a major faction and they aren't ""ground into dust"" so that's kind of a bad example.to take care of npc pirates, a bounty should = shared kill rights (the bigger the bounty the more people have kill rights) and if you have kill rights (from being killed in an unprovoked attack), you can place a bounty.however, my understanding is that most people who want to be able to war dec npc corps want to shoot mission runners and miners without consequences. i don't think that will happen. stick to flipping their cans in hopes that they will flip them back."
5/7/2010,i support this poor troll and/or service
5/7/2010,this'll happen
5/7/2010,not supported
5/7/2010,"meh. i was going to post a few points refuting some of the stupidity in this thread (other peoples, lol) but i just can't be bothered anymore. eve is never going to be developed in a direction i'm going to be happy playing."
5/7/2010,"if it makes you any happier, ccp themselves have said they're not entirely content with local being used as an intel tool."
5/7/2010,"that's not really what i'm talking about, but i've heard them mention that on a few occasions.eve is just going to continue down a path that makes the game softer and friendlier to stupid people who make mistakes and don't want to pay for them. that's disappointing to me because i know that as each year passes, the game isn't going to be more refined and made a sharper leaner more uncompromising more competitive game- quite the opposite: its' going to become even more carebear oriented with all the 'toning down' and 'hand holding'.i wish i were wrong, but sadly, i know i'm not. i'd like to see anyone prove it otherwise."
5/7/2010,"coming from the one who want easy kills of targets who cant be expected to have a chance at actually surviving the fight?you are joking, right?if i want to kill wh pve'ers i first need to find a wormhole that is actually occupied and being used at the moment. that can be quite a long work, especially not in prime time they are quite often deserted, even the ones with a pos in them. to find one you can go through a string of whs, but you got decent chance it collapses somewhere behind you leaving your horribly lost. contrary to what you claim (have you ever been in one?), wh systems do not have belts. you will have to probe everything down. even if you manage to find a wormhole system with active pve'ers, you wont be able to find it again tomorrow. it is a completely random process that involves alot of luck of finding a wh system with active people in them. this contrary to normal space, if i want to go to find a ratter in normal space i look at the map, development indices, etc, and i see i should set destination to hed. the route there will stay always the same."
5/7/2010,"outside of hi-sec, where and how is this the case? given that ccp only a year ago increased the map by 50% and made the whole of that extra space in to delayed local, i'd say that you should have more grounds for optimism than pessimism."
5/7/2010,"the irony of your posts is amusing.the only way eve will head down that path is if ccp started listening to lazy players such as yourself, always wanting to buff your toys and handicap your targets. have you noticed that all you do is whine about making things easier for you? and then you have the galls to complain about people wanting this game on easy mode? thats you. you are the one wanting to play eve on easy mode, bellum.until you realize that you are the carebear begging ccp to make your profession easier than the rest this is all pointless. seriously, bellum, you sound bitter. you throw tantrums when people disagree with you. you accuse ccp of going soft when they dont buff/nerf the things you want. you have to take a few steps back and look at the bigger picture. realize that this game needs balance. and that suggesting half-baked ideas like removing local without keeping things balanced isnt the way to go. and if ccp isnt listening to you that it might be because what you think is an awesome idea might not be that awesome. the clues are there. you just have to open your eyes to see them.or, you could just continue calling people wussies and carebears for not agreeing with your ideas, which honestly, i think is more likely :p. but the only one that ends up looking like a carebear is you."
5/7/2010,"oh hai bellum...funny, you propose same thing, when i wrote this stuff up a while ago, you flushed it down the toilet.and i wrote up how exactly would those local removals work.first of all, local would display people only in scan range from stations and pos's adapted to local scanning. local in delayed mode. we can go on about this, yet it is so easy to do. it's just that ccp don't care about this, just as they don't care about lagg. while i'd just adore to go nuke those localscanwarpoffcloakravenbots, my hopes are not high...thumbsdown for the op, thumbs up to the one that presents complete idea for local nerf for 0.0 . tldr. ttfn"
5/7/2010,"it's probably been brought up befor in this thread but i'm too lazy to read the backlog, removing local even if scanning mechanisms where improved would still provide a major problem, military 5 systems are visible on your map, which means you now immidiatly know where your targets are (as is already the case but atleast currently you'd have an accurate idea of how safe it is to rat)"
5/7/2010,"yeah, but again, scanning fixes these.1. you specifically say you use local to 'identify' targets. you can do the same with a single probe. you may not get them 100% right off the bat, but you can hit the entire system (teon, not included for obvious reasons.) thus, you don't need to spend any more time on the hunt to find someone.2. no, roams don't have to worry, but you got in that wormhole by scanning. thus you prove that scanning is the solution with said arguement.1. wait, you mean this isn't a multiplayer game? (or at least a game where you bring an alt with you everywhere?)2. i don't fly them much, but it may be a boost to any cloaky ship, not just stealth bombers.3. stront your pos or actually watch your systmes. stop afking your empire and you don't have a problem. as for spies, they already exist, ergo solution is already there.it is difficult to become 100% unscanable in anything larger than frigate, and even then, the person has to give up most, if not all mid slots."
5/7/2010,"obviously you have no idea , you can leave scanning alt in any wormhole system , and grief residents to death , until they leave , quit etc.it is only slightly more difficult to do than to come through gates.i will always support removing of local ."
5/7/2010,unfortunatly i have to agree with you.
5/7/2010,"and if there is lets say 500 enemies in one system, that you don't really know is there, but lets just say they are there.what do you do then without local?.scan them all out and waste a whole day to later find out that they're about to leave local?.yeah, no local is going to work good.do you guys even think for 5 secs before you even post that you support this idea as it is now?."
5/7/2010,silly idea for lazy pvpers to get easier ganks
5/7/2010,"1. do you have any idea how many empty ships are sitting in poss in most 0.0 systems? scanning would not fix this unless you could tell if the ship was being piloted or not.2. so you scan for other whs in the system... sadly, today there was only one that remained that hadn't collapsed (and you collapsed it when you entered), try again tomorrow. tomorrow, you find whs, some come out in high sec (and some of your pilots can't fly there) one comes out on the opposite side of eve from where you live. no, scanning doesn't solve this. this is why people rarely take roams through whs. we've done it a few times, and have gotten some people stuck along the way.1. please read my comment again. my point is exactly that. no local decreases the multiplayer aspect because people would have to spread out a lot more to find targets to kill.2. stealth bomber gangs, black ops gangs, these would become the primary roaming gang. few other pvp ships would be used as they would show up on scans and have to enter through gates that would have scouts watching.3. you are missing the point. because enemies can see your fleet moving towards them currently, they have a chance to pull together a defense fleet, so your fleet needs to be larger and more dedicated to actually wanting to flip sov or take a moon. without local, fleets could reinforce random fixed structures to keep an enemy running around. managing sov is unpleasant enough without having to deal with this.my tengu can warp cloak, fly through bubbles, can't be scanned, and easily can kill ratters and miners. it is also more than capable ratting. the same could be said of all t3 ships. basically, no local would make these ships 100x better than they already are. noobs would hate 0.0 more than they already do because they wouldn't be able to find anything for pvp and would keep getting ganked by ships they have no way of defending against. the idea is to try to get more people to enter 0.0, not turn it into a good'ol'boys club for making fat isk."
5/7/2010,leave arties alone...nerf lasers!!!!! xd
5/7/2010,"i am so supporting this, finally assembly hall has some decent ideaswould love to see more emo tj ideas <3"
5/7/2010,your attempts at trolling are failing now go troll something with a lower entry level where you might actually succeed like omegle or chatroulette and go knock yourself out.
5/7/2010,"lol...no.not supported, :thumbsdown: and all that jazz."
5/7/2010,"i totally agree! in fact i suggest we all go one further and just have the modules, gun, speed and tank, so all ships are identical,we mujst remove all skills and of course there should only be one ship called, you guessed it spaceship, then when everything is totally in balance the side with the most players insta wins, meaning we all get more time to sleep!"
5/7/2010,"1. unlike what u may believe, high sec does have risks. they're called ninja salvagers, which is a consequence of missioning in high sec--they get ""protected"" too and even if they steal from a wreck, they'll have backup waiting to take down your expensive mission ship if u try anything stupid. and it works just fine.2. the directional scanner is absolute garbage, especially when pirates can just use covert ops ships to bypass it.3. pirates don't have to camp the gates--they just have to camp the mission area and the agents and even with buffed sentry guns (which doesn't apply to the agents in lowest sec systems anyway) they'll just encourage bigger blobs in return.4. severely half-assing both pve and pvp would lead to strict fit restrictions and leads to misconceptions towards pvp because a. u can't use a buffer tank in missions as u would in pvp b. u can't speed tank against the uber rat's webs in missions as u would in pvp, which means no small ships that can otherwise be used in pvp c. u're always going point-blank since the uber rats dps at that range, when there r ways to pvp just within warp disruptor range d. ewar mods can't be fitted because they're all used for the dps and tanking u'll need against the uber rats, not to mention the warp jammer u'll have to fit when u get ambushed. e. cap stability, which isn't a primary concern in pvp, will still be an issue because depending on how uber these rats r, all the cap boosters u can carry won't be enough to keep up the active tank u're gonna be forced to use when u get ambushed.5. do u honestly think that u'd know every single pilot's behavior and habits simply by researching a few killboards of only a few of them? 'cause all they have to do is find out where all the pirate faction agents r and camp their systems and with the many pirates it's gonna attract, it's essentially 23/7 camping.6. we're talking about these new missions correct? where it's not tons of rats but 3 uber tackling, tanking, and dps rats that web u so u're not gonna get very far from the warp-in point in the first place? u know, the ones u can't volley down, unlike the previous frigate tackler rats, because these r uber rats?7. and i never said anything about helping miners either. what i did say was that the game is already unbalanced in favor of miners because if anyone's flooding the markets, it's the thousands of exhumers infesting high sec belts with all the minerals they macro mine. not that hard to figure out.8. in conclusion, this won't work at all because:* u'll be warp jammed and webbed by uber rats the entire mission, so the blobs won't have to switch to tacklers because the gank is so much easier now since...* u're gimping yourself with the strict fit requirements needed to survive the rats and kill them quickly enough so u're not warp jammed by the time the pirates find u (if that's even possible)* those strict fitting requirements r pretty much half-assing both pve and pvp because they r two very different aspects with different fitting requirements, meaning if they find u in time, u won't be able to put up a fight in the first place because a. u'll be susceptible to volley/blob dmg with the active tank for pve b. the cap stability needed for the active tank to survive the rats long enough will hurt u in pvp c. last but not least, u're fitted with close range weapons, meaning all the pirates have to do is fit for mid-long range dps and u're gonna get ez ganked the same way.so go ahead and do all your research because it's not gonna change anything against the tons of pirates that will camp the agents and nearby systems, so u're never gonna get any mission done, which means no faction standings here. and if u try one in a ridiculously gimp half-assed fit, hope u like padding your enemies' killboards, 'cause that's what's gonna happen when u have 3 uber tackler rats holding u in place while the pirates lolsnipe u down with impunity."
5/7/2010,"hi there, total carebare atm. your idea is stupid. go play hello kitty island adventures instead of eve. piracy=moarfun"
5/7/2010,you wouldn't happen to be an ankhesentapemkah alt would you?
5/7/2010,"lol, will..nice troll.wanna post a bit about your history in various pirate corps? :p"
5/7/2010,"i too, fully support this idea. pirates are bad people and should have to pay more irl money to play this game. but you didn't have to lie to us tough, your girlfriend calling was actually your mother shouting to do the dishes. internetspaceship pilots don't have girlfriends."
5/7/2010,tell you girlfriend to stfu while you're playing eve.
5/7/2010,not supported. this is simply not enough to deter piracy.i suggest ccp forms an international law authority for anything eve related. killed a hauler? well that's your call as a player but you made your choice. a petition will be automatically made by the hauler and the ccp police will be knocking on your door in no less than 5 business days. the police will take you to the top secret ccp prison inside the eyjafjallaj<U+FFFD>kull volcano and you will be put into special disciplinary clinics until you are deemed eligible to play.
5/7/2010,this. you should make it a proposal. i can think of at least 1 csm candidate who would definitely support this.
5/7/2010,"that sounds rather kinky, now, where was my tempest..."
5/7/2010,"it would be nice to be able to add combat probes to an overview setting; so that, you can just scan for that item only. currently you have scan for everything to see them in a direction scan."
5/7/2010,"okay, seriously... you state under your employment history posting personal information is not allowed.applebabethis isn't a troll against your csm campaign and there's no spin here. unless you've collected a paycheck from ccp or you're going to argue that csm = employment, you've not been 'employed' by them in any way."
5/7/2010,"wow that's pretty good...although, technically, the free trip to iceland could be marked down as ""payment"" +1 to you seleene"
5/7/2010,"im suprised at you seleene, thought u had better things to do if im honest employment is a contract between two parties, one being the employer and the other being the employee. an employee may be defined as: ""a person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, where the employer has the power or right to control and direct the employee in the material details of how the work is to be performed."" black's law dictionary page 471 (5th ed. 1979).so technically in essence someone can be employed without renumeration or written contract.personally i wouldnt call it employment but thats my own definition i dont believe there was any intention to decieve.but i suppose when you get involved in politics even in a game more people want to stab you in the back bring you down and basically treat people like dirt but hey thats eve online"
5/7/2010,"so if i am at a dinner, with, say, the president and he asks me to pass the salt, this means i can say on my resume that i served under the president of the united states. awesome."
5/7/2010,"lol im not suprised at that response by you.i believe it means that if you are given a job to do with direction and clear goals (ie the csm) under the service of another (ie ccp & eve online players) contract being verbal or written (i believe you guys sign some paperwork/disclaimer).ccp directs and controls the csm to a extent as they get you to iceland i would say also provide accom and food etc.in the uk immigration can arrest a immigrant in work where their passport says they cant, if they argue hey im not getting paid, the counter arguement is , well u receive food/accom thats payment ur gone byebye.-passing salt to the president is a grosse example of misunderstanding and over simplfacation of what im trying to say and underlines to me what i hate about politics and the csm, but this year ive decided to give it a chance and see what good may come from it."
5/7/2010,so i could seriously put the csm on my resume and an employer would take me seriously about it? hmm...
5/7/2010,ankh you didn't answer to my question so why would i bother even look at your video (ps: you sound more ******ed than ever)
5/7/2010,"actually all csm members sign an agreement that explicitly states that being on the csm does not imply having a job with ccp and that it does not imply that you will be hired in the future.while being on the csm is definitely something you could put on your resume, you can't list it as 'work experience' or phrase it in such a way that it seems ccp was your employer, as that is simply not true. in fact, employees of ccp are not allowed to be on the csm: it is a player council, not a dev council. csm members are not employees by definition."
5/7/2010,"o...m...f...gi'm actually going to vote for this tard as i agree with the others here who are enjoying the lulz. the delusional and contradictory ramblings that spew forth from this individual and the responses provoked, provide endless entertainment.besides; ccp are hardly going to ruin the unique experience that is eve due to one persons uninformed opinions... are they?"
5/7/2010,"absolutely, here at work we had a nice laugh about the cv nonsense a few minutes ago."
5/7/2010,"well, if you can't laugh at yourself - who can you laugh at eh?"
5/7/2010,ignorance is bliss.
5/7/2010,"i can guarantee you that for someone wanting a job in the game industry, listing volunteer positions under employment is very, very bad form. they should be separate and explicitly listed as such. come to think of it, it's true in all industries.i believe there was intention to pad her resume, which is totally in tune with the rest of her public persona : a fraud. i'd expect it from an insecure 18 year old looking for a first job, not a 26 year old graduate... hint : no one with any realistic sense of self calls themselves an expert on anything less than a year after graduation, or mentions working on two mmos without listing titles or shipping dates. come on, you know i'm right :)"
5/7/2010,most rich elitist gaming companies have something called an nda
5/7/2010,keep digging
5/7/2010,"i was genuinely curious about a response to the point sel was making. lets face it, it can easily be considered to be misrepresentation of your relationship with ccp, which speaks to your character. this, in turn, could speak to the quality of the community representation you will exhibit while on the csm.not trolling, genuine questions (in my opinion)"
5/7/2010,nitpicking about technicalities. she did all the things she mentioned. who cares about her actually being a paid employee? the things she did are relevant for her cv. so calling her a 'liar' because of this kinda looks like trolling to me :d
5/7/2010,"consider for a moment whether it should go under employment history. there are other parts to a cv, and listing it at the top of the employment history when it has been clearly stated that csm members have signed an agreement not to represent themselves as being employed by ccp. so, she has essentially breached her contract...is that someone you can trust?"
5/7/2010,[repeat mode]technicalities[/repeat mode]nobody is caring about this mate. mail it directly to ccp and say she 'essentially breached her contract'.
5/7/2010,"yes or mail it to my current employer, email is on the website."
5/7/2010,what's one of those?
5/7/2010,"you put the word liar in quotes as if you were quoting seleene saying ankh is a liar. where is that quoted from, specifically? or, are you just paraphrasing/reinterpreting?"
5/7/2010,i like this idea.
5/7/2010,"lot's of ""burn the witch!!"" idiots in here. if you don't win a spot ankh' at least you can put troll slayer on your cv."
5/7/2010,"basicly, ppl who ***** about this non-issue are calling her a deceiver/liar/whatever. but the quoted part is from this post:the same person who claims 'we are not trolling' a few posts later.[repeat mode]well, nitpicking about a completely irrelevant technicality just to make ank look bad looks like trolling to me. and yes, it is irrelevant. it's all about the way you should write your resume: do you put volunteer/non paid jobs under employment history or not? [/repeat mode]"
5/7/2010,don't put it under employment history ank or you'll be lynched!1!!!
5/7/2010,fixed.
5/7/2010,she has the bright ones on her side i see.
5/7/2010,"it's not nitpicking, it's a serious issue over the eligibility of her even being able to run for csm, and i hope someone brings it to ccp's attention. either a breach of contract took place or she was employed by ccp and either front makes her ineligible to run for csm."
5/7/2010,"i'm not calling her anything and i'm not trolling any of her views about the game or whatever the fotm in this thread is, but her saying that she's been employed by ccp or worked with them in any capacity outside of the csm is false. that's all. *shrug*"
5/7/2010,[repeat mode]why don't you bring it to their attention? as i suggested: mail them! [/repeat mode] [repeat]as i said b4: it all comes down to how you think you should write a resume. listing something as csm member under employment history doesn't sound that far fetched to me. it's completely relevant in this case.

5/7/2010,eve tribune interview is up!
5/7/2010,you had my only vote. i was pretty desperate to find serious candidates that are actually interested in the game itself and not in petty details. plus that i totally share your point of view on anything.
5/7/2010,ankhesentapemkah >
5/7/2010,"pointing out that somebody is bad, has done something bad, doesn't deserve a csm spot etc. etc. is trolling right? no i don't put my volunteering (which i do a lot of) under my employment history, because i wasn't bloody employed by them! and writing a cv wrongly isn't an 'irrelevaant technicality', people make serious decisions based on them and saying that she worked for a large multi-national games company like ccp when she didn't is blatantly stretching the truth to make herself look better."
5/7/2010,"in most companies, falsifying employment history is grounds for termination."
5/7/2010,"her time in the csm is relevant considering the work she does, at least more relevant than here time at the v&d and i dont see anyone complaining about that. at most you can say she could make it clearer what the csm is, or give it another name than employment history, but honestly that is nitpicking, not to mention the slight issue that this is just something that is on her site. for the people hoping she gets fired because of this (which makes you a pretty sad person), you are deluded."
5/7/2010,you my voice
5/7/2010,"both here and on tweakers you are acting like her sockpuppet, are you actually getting something out of this or are you just a alt ?and wether people would like to see her fired is beside the point this is just one more example of her lying and twisting facts and one more reason why people should not vote for her.not only is she totally out of tune with this game she also is a proven liar,exploiter, bad corp member and not mentally competent to fill this position as proven over time."
5/7/2010,"damn dude, was that diatribe ^^ a response to my statement?"
5/7/2010,as one who enjoys rping i'm interested to learn what motivated you to choose the name ankhesentapemkah.thanks!
5/7/2010,"who the hell knows, i don't think anyone's trying to make someone lose their job here. the reason that particular topic caught my eye is that the character of the candidate means a lot in how i pick who to vote for. or, to use an analogy, i wouldn't put a thief in charge of security for a bank. it doesn't matter which candidate it is."
5/7/2010,i might've voted for you again.
5/7/2010,"voted, all accounts."
5/7/2010,"thanks for all the support and votes, folks! your posts here, your evemails, and convos all mean a lot. the support is very gratifying.please note that i've added another focus group to the schedule. the topic for this one is the mercenary profession. we'll discuss issues, challenges, where the profession is heading, and what tools or game changes might be made to support that profession. although the merc profession is not a specific issue on my campaign platform, it is affected by some of the ones that are. since i'm in the merc environment and there was interest from my colleagues, i decided it would be fun to discuss as a group."
5/7/2010,"you have my vote aswell.although i don't actually do most of the stuff you support, i do agree that it does need some attention and fine tuning. to that end i will support you."
5/7/2010,"generally speaking those that lark has supported were never a bad choice - him included in csm ... whatever. i do not agree fully with rr-ing. part because i use it, part because i want to use it a bit more and part because you did not mention what will happen with the sec status penalty you get when you rr outlaws.hope you find more blob penalties. there is someone else i would vote for, but it is better to vote for a recent ex-pirate than for a long-time-ago ex-pirate. :)"
5/7/2010,/vote
5/7/2010,"by urging--if they don't already have one--a ccp policy for responding quickly and with useful information to soothe nerves and put out fires in escalating rage threads about exploits or other similarly serious issues. by encouraging ccp to work with the csm to aid in responding to the community and managing players' expectations.although they've gotten better about it lately, ccp is still often slower to respond to volatile broke-game, exploit, cheating and other ""big issue"" threads than reasonable players would prefer. even given nda and internal policy considerations that likely affect the timing and content of such responses, i'm convinced there is room for improvement."
5/7/2010,"mynxee i have followed your blog and your csm run. so far i am impressed. i was wondering in your ""quest"" to improve low sec if you would think about giving the idea's brought forth from the 09 vegas meet and concideration. the overview can be found here."

5/7/2010,"i was attending this meeting about this very subject at fanfest last year. the speaker said it very well, so i'll try to paraphrase:keeping the story straight and non-contradictory is very difficult, even when its being written by a handful of ccp employees. letting players get in on it just makes it too hard to keep the story consistent.this doesn't mean that players cant have any impact whatsoever. but i really doubt ccp will allow players to write out the minor details- only let them impact the major events. i like whatever opportunity there is for the players to write the story. and this doesn't even take into account the ongoing story of 0.0 politics, which is entirely player driven."
5/7/2010,i re-edited the original post to show my issues. the first version is very old. i will have a website coming up soon.sooooonplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.
5/7/2010,"maz,can you expand on improve low sec? its been a very long time since i've spent any meaningful time in low sec, but i'm curious as to how you think this space should be used to add unique content. did you have specific ideas, or are you asking that ccp should begin looking at it?moss"
5/7/2010,"it has been a while for me too, since there's nothing worthwhile in there to kill.here is my plan for lowsec- it is subject to much change, but the end goal is to increase the income(but not lower the risk) until it becomes worthwhile for carebears to live there, after factoring in ship losses.how much income is the real question. i don't know how receptive ccp will be to increasing it to be equal to or greater than 0.0- or even how high it ought to be raised to attract people there."
5/7/2010,mazz has my votes! she manages to get things done and make the csm entertaining.
5/7/2010,"all your issues are the exact ones needed to take the pirate vote.but you are not pirate - you used to be one many seasons ago, and your alliance was one of the biggest abusers of the no-joy aoe dd. i do believe that you honestly wish to get rid of the robot army of 0.0, but your way of doing it serves the interests of your alliance as well - more targets is not a bad thing though.while voting for you would serve my interests as a voter i feel that you would serve more the interests of your alliance. not to mention those rumours i heard about your attendance to csm meetings.after first looking through the candidates roster - thanks for only putting it in devblog form ccp i had to go to another site that had a link to your own site, i have found just you, mynxee, omber zombie, sok and helen as names i took an interest in.your thread is the first i am looking at so why do you think you should get my 5 votes over the others ?"
5/7/2010,"why in the world would i be in lowsec when i know there's more targets in 0.0?and the same thing is true of my corp. we left 0.0 because the targets kept going away. we would camp a gate and eventually most of the carebears went extinct. the ratters in 0.0 are all battleships, unlike lowsec, and everyone has much better loot than lowsec. we had too many people for the number of people we were fighting. carebear 0.0 alliances were much better, because they're awful at following fleet orders, and we could fight way outnumbered.why is there such a big deal about what security status you're in? if you're some person, greifing carebears every day, does that not make you a pirate? if lowsec had more targets we would spend more time there."
5/7/2010,"you are clinging to a small section of my post.i do not care why your corp left low-sec for 0.0, your reasons are your own.that was just touched in passing in my post.i said that the issues i saw being mentioned in the op were the ones that the pirates might look for. the pirate vote is not exactly big, but it is not small and right now i see just a few candidates ready to take it - you included.it is my impression upon reading the op, but you are looking to get the pirate vote to boost your own alliance vote."
5/7/2010,"i dont really see anything nefarious in trying to get votes, or being in an alliance. i dont really see any conflict of interest. both groups like to kill lots and lots of stuff. so for as long as there's no way i can pass a csm issue to give all alliances named pandemic legion free money, there's not really any way this can be a bad thing for everyone not pandemic legion."
5/7/2010,"no politician will ever see anything nefarious with trying to get votes, but that doesn't meant that voter who got 'tricked' into giving his vote will feel the same way. :)as for the conflic of interests, you take it a step too far; i never mentioned a conflict of interest, certainly it has never been before and will not be so with the usual 4-5 votes going to the major 0.0 powerblock backed characters.since you've avoided the issue for the 2nd time, i have to ask you directly, what about the rumours i heard about your attendance record to csm meetings ?le: i just re-read your op and you touch on 2 things that will affect the low-sec player.that is the small gang improvement effort and the revitalizing of low-sec and 0.0. low-sec does offer some opportunities as isk making source that is superior to 0.0 - yes ... superior."
5/7/2010,"that video is ****, tbh"
5/7/2010,"oh, so that's what you were asking about. look at the csm meeting minutes. i never missed a csm meeting except in cases where i notified them ahead of time due to rl issues, and only then was rare. i was late to some fanfest panel, because i was pretty sick at the time."
5/7/2010,"tbh, it was kinda the question from my 1st post in this thread. :)thanks for the answer.i can't promise you all my votes, but you will get some for sure. :)"
5/7/2010,"i am sure that the issue has been brought a number of times before but i wonder about your comment over the issue.i am talking about the amount of armor, shield, energy logistics have contributed to the battle. if the amount is recorded into the kill mails somehow then many players would enjoy flying logistics and this would result in much longer lasting and satisfying battles.this could basically be done by adding the player to the kill mail if he has repped a player who had aggro on the target/damage dealers in the km; same thing seems to work when repping someone in empire - then the repper gets aggro too.healing (or armor/shield rep as it is known in eve) and buffing (or warfare bonuses) are very old and well known concept in most of the mmorpg world.a wise developer would make people comfortable playing ""healers"" since this makes the game much more deeper and interesting for everybody.playing healing character is not that rewarding in most of the games (compared to the damage dealers) but in eve it is even worst. virtually you get no record for your contribution to the battle."
5/7/2010,question: what's your pricing this time round?politician for sale: i'm selling my csm powers!!!bored and servers are still down .. sorry
5/7/2010,nothin :p it was a jokei think this would be hard for ccp to manage. i'm not sure about this.
5/7/2010,vote
5/7/2010,"i was thinking about what the csm should do, and it obviously needs to be the voice of players reminding ccp what the real problems are as experienced by the players.have the other candidates not been playing the same eve as i? the real short-term problem, right now, is lag.no other candidate even mentions the word ""lag"" in their platform.this alone gets you my vote.the other two problems are ugly ui thrown together haphazardly and hostility towards rookies.the ui needs to be attractive enough that people taking screenshots keep it on. the futuristic mockups we all saw go in the right direction. we disagree on how to improve the ui. you believe in addons, i believe it would be far better if the ui that comes with the client wasn't so obviously unacceptably bad that no eve pilot recommends to rookies to just leave it alone and go with the defaults. the default ui needs to present information we all want (ship types, local, etc.) in a visually attractive manner.while we disagree on how to solve the problem, at least you recognize that it exists. thank you.i wish you also saw the hostility towards rookies and understood how it affects game growth and particularly retention, but you're already nailed two out of three problems, and that's a pretty good platform.platform-wise, you simply have no competition. i sincerely hope you win."
5/7/2010,you have my vote o7eve<U+FFFD>s worst problem is the lag. it will not be easily solved so we need the right person on the right place
5/7/2010,"well, for me, it's all about making the business case to ccp that the cheapest way to refresh the ui in the long-run is to do it so that the playerbase can provide most of the bells-and-whistles for free. the trick is addressing the legitimate concern that allowing player access to the ui will end up being destabilizing.but even if ccp decides not to permit addons on tq, refactoring the ui using an addon model has significant benefits: it makes porting to new platforms much easier, and if ccp limited player addons just to singularity, then the template for a lot of complaints goes from ""this is broken! fix it!"" to ""this is broken; here is a patch - consider it"", which is much more likely to happen.this is an interesting topic that i haven't thought about deeply. in retrospect, i was lucky in that within a few weeks of starting the game, i was recruited by a small corp of extremely newbie-friendly players, who then quickly joined a nascent alliance, and i've been working with them ever since.what would you suggest be done to make the game more newbie-friendly, other than the obvious things like make the npe better? can you come up with a way to make ""mentoring"" a profession in the game, for example?"
5/7/2010,"thats the main reason for me too.everyone has lots of interessting ideas how they would like change things in eve, but lag is the only _problem_ eve has, so this is where the csm should be activ. that would help every eve player. iam not 100% sure about your solution to handle lag, but i think it goes in to the right direction. improving the server performance will never be enough for 0.0 warfare without node crashs and gridload problems.ccp have to find be a way to prevent lag."
5/7/2010,"my and i corp will vote for the candidate who can bring these ideas up in meetingscorps like assassin corps who rely on being employed by other corps to make money have no way of advertising themselves. if a corp wants to be found they have to have what they do in their name eg. assassins 4 hire, hoping they'll be found in the people search, but there needs to be a better system. i want to see in the meeting minutes there were discussions over making the billboards across eve rent-able for advertisements or something similar. this would give corps more purpase, which at this point in time is becoming rare."
5/7/2010,"done. and you know i only get three of those per year... so, use it well."
5/7/2010,"""solo miners can make just as much money in high-sec with no risk. small mining groups can make tons more mining abc ores in wormhole space which, frankly, is safer than low-sec"". this what you think and you also want the miners go in to low-sec areas?""high sec mining keeps eve running, and messing with that would have potentially disastrous effects. the best option, as i see it, is to remove the dense ores from high sec (the massive scordite, dense veldspar, et cetera) and increase their ratios in low-sec.""i m not a miner but a member of a minining corp. and i think that your ideas about to miners not good for their future."
5/7/2010,"i think the problem goes beyond this. if i am griefing someone, a neutral char can rep me and the victim cannot attack the repairer without getting an aggression timer themselves. this was a tactic that is being used in high-sec and faction fighting.(t)hank(s)"
5/7/2010,"see that's the difference between me and most low-sec candidates: i don't want to say ""ok, everyone in high-sec, you've had a good run but off to low sec you go!!"" but what about that corp that kind of wants to try out living on the risky side? right now there is no reason for them to go to low-sec; it's riskier and about equally as profitable, so it makes no sense. and even if corps do decide to move there, as they often do, they just wind up moving out in a few weeks because they realize first hand that it's just not worth the time.then i'd love to hear your concerns, i've put a fair amount of thought into boosting low-sec but i'm always open to new ideas. maybe it's the fact that it's 4am and i'm half-coherent, but i'm not sure i get what you take issue with. i assume it's a neutral char repping, getting shot, docking, and switching to a combat ship? however in the proposed change, the neutral logistics will have to rep, get shot, wait a minute, dock, wait thirty seconds, switch ships, wait another thirty seconds, and then undock, giving two minutes total waiting time. perhaps you can do me a solid and elaborate a bit."
5/7/2010,"ok, try this. while i am ratting in empire, you show up and engage me. during the battle, another char who is neutral warps in and starts to repair you. if i engage this other char, i get a sec hit for attacking the neutral. if we are an high-sec, concord is coming after both of us, but not the neutral char doing the repairing. if we have a war dec between us and we engage in high-sec, i get the sec hit for attacking the neutral and concord comes after me. delaying the neutral's docking and jumping only really helps in null sec space by preventing the neutral from running away to a station or another system.[edit] forgot to include that setting an aggression flag for repairing was in place previously. fof missiles and drones would attack the repairer since the repairer had the aggression flag. the other side used a tactic of not jamming the repairer but jamming the one being repaired.(t)hank(s)"
5/7/2010,what are your positions on the current state of rockets and assault frigates? (i am nothing if not single minded)
5/7/2010,"giving you my votes.hope you'll really focus on low-sec mostly. a lot of other issues you've mentioned are probably already getting their attention via all the others.also, i'll try to bring you some more votes via my fellows/followers/disciples :)good luck!"
5/7/2010,"thump up for many of yours ideas and knowledge. ur got my 3 votes. however there are thump down ideas that i d like to bring out after long time discussed with other players. the ecm system and eccm is working as fine as ever. especially for ship with small drone bay. it would be even more intersting if have the ecm let the jam % increase a litle bit but reduce jammed timer. think about it. it not only keep the smile of those small drone bay ship but also bring heart of those big ship with slow locking back to beating sooner. it also give the inti or small ship with fast locking speed more invulnerable for ecm ( force the use of small combat drones on them) plus another way of defense against boring lowsec gate camp ( draw ppl to low sec, plus, plus)i d love to hear ur idea about the balance of caldari ship and fit ( rail gun, missile, passive tank) just as u r speaking for the largest population of eve citizen and have had the most number of newly joining players- pilots. how r ur understanding of so many complaining and disappointing of the caldarian with their ships in pvp , which force them sadly quit their race ship and train for something else or close up their mind and wait for the nerf which every time make it worse. what was wrong ! the pilot or the ship and how d u do to help ? change the ship bonus or educating the pilots. i recognize some reply brough it up for many many candicates but all r replies r hardly satisfied or ignored ( as it still got brough up). tks and sorry for typos as its 3.50 am here"
5/7/2010,my rook wingman is the coolest dude in game.
5/7/2010,"unless something has drastically changed like...today, as soon as the neutral warps in to repair me he becomes flagged to you. if the neutral is repping a pirate (who isn't gcc), the neutral repper becomes gcc (i was actually aware of this last aspect myself until recently, and i'm of the opinion that it's unintentional and should be fixed)i do think you may want to try this again, or i'm totally missing what you're saying again if the neutral reps your war target, he becomes flagged to you. i mean, concord doesn't come in guns blazing to smite the heretic, but you can shoot him in his face without repercussion. rockets are beyond useless, they aren't even viable enough to use ironically. i don't even know why they got nerfed and forgotten, rocket crows and maledictions were never really considered to be overpowered, but they were viable and i'd like to return to that.about af's, it's a tricky business. there are some that i think are pretty good in a pvp environment, namely the jaguar, wolf, and ishkur. the enyo and hawk are decent pve platforms that can dabble in pvp. i guess the harpy is funny when it's sniping pods. the vengeance is nothing short of terrible, but i think that has to do more with the fact that rockets are bad than anything else. the reribution has one freakin' mid slot. i mean, i don't expect every single ship to be a pvp platform, but c'mon. i've seen it used to run low-level complexes and up to level 3 missions, but just because it's barely functional doesn't mean it's good. when it comes down to it, i wouldn't mind seeing a new bonus to afs but don't think the ships are totally useless as they are now (except the amarr ones). what i don't want to see is af's becoming better than interceptors at tackling. would giving them an ab speed bonus make them too over powered? probably. at first glace, if you gave them a web strength bonus so that they can work alongside interceptors at tackling it would seem pretty cool - but i think that would be a little bit overpowered - i mean i wouldn't want to fly an interceptor over an af if that change was made. it's one of those issues that requires a lot of consideration, there is simply no clear answer. i appreciate the support from a fellow low-sec brosef. low-sec is my main focus and my main concern; in my view it's the area of the game that is most underrepresented and most in need of help."
5/7/2010,"i think we have similar ideas for ecm drones: that is, make the smaller ones more effective against smaller ships and not totally crippling the larger ships who just sit in space mashing lock.as far as caldari ships in a pvp environment, i think they function as a pretty good transition race from pve to pvp. obviously everyone knows how great caldari are in a pve setting, but for those pve pilots who are trying to break into the pvp world the caldari have a lot to offer. the blackbird, for instance. i don't think any gang will turn away a blackbird from their ranks. the ferox: a good blaster platform in pvp. the drake: i'm not joking when i say it's a very good pvp platform; as far as bcs go it's right up there with the best of them. with battleships, the blaster rokh is good, the torp raven has it's place, and the scorp can jam from crazy far.but you are right, eventually people train out caldari for pvp. i think most of it has to do with the fact that none of the ships are really sexy. they are functional, but not cool if that makes sense. when i first started to pvp, i started with caldari. it went blackbird, crow, falcon - and i stayed there for awhile. then i got seduced by the speed and allure of minmatar and i won't pull any punches here, it was cooler. i've come full circle, and although i dabble in amarr and minmatar, i always come back to the trusty drake.i don't think it's a huge drawback to be caldari in pvp, support is vital if not flashy. although the gallente or amarr can pvp and pve without having to cross train, the caldari ships will always have an important place and i am satisfied with their role as it is. every ship has their role, when it comes down to it i think eve would be a far more boring place if all the races and all the ship classes were completely balanced."
5/7/2010,do you have any thoughts on introduction bounty missions run by concord agents against negative sec status players? maybe it could give a chance for the hunted to become the hunter and vice versa. (t)hank(s)

5/7/2010,"i was going to squeeze you with some tricky questions like last election, but that's not needed imo, you did great during this csm.+3 for tea! fake edit:with stakeholder status, which issues will you try to unburrow from the depths of the backlog the most?"
5/7/2010,"short term this could address the most pressing issues, but at some point ccp will have to bite the bullet and commit to a full overhaul of the core ui. if we are lucky they might be able to come up with a roadmap of building replacement ui elements in stages and effectively phase in a new ui over time.only ccp can decide when to commit to this, but until then i am willing to support (and have already supported) proposals related to ui improvements.whilst on the hot button issues, i also support (and csm4 already discussed it at length with ccp at the summit) issues relating to lag reduction.no candidate is going to deny that lag isn't an issue for many people. however the fact is the csm can't fix lag. the csm can keep pressure on ccp to investigate solutions but only they can deliver a working solution. anyone outside of the ccp dev team doesn't have the knowledge to design a fix and whilst ideas seem obvious on paper they have likely been discussed already.i am restricted by what i can discuss on the subject because we had a detailed presentation before the lag discussion (at the level of showing various performance numbers) and i'm not going to risk leaking nda information. of course this allows people to claim i'm ignoring the issue anyway, thanks again to my supporters and i hope some of the potential supporters can see my commitment to the csm process"

5/7/2010,"i herby call into question the voting for the cms 5. my application was submitted well in time and my credntials were sent as asked for yet my name in not included in the vote. why not? is it because the same ole same ole group of people don't want to share? there were numrous questions and statements from players in the forum that there was no point in running since it was either a) allready a done deal with the same people running things and or b) it didn't matter anyway since ccp simply used the csm as a smoke screen and or ignored them totally. is it because i ""rocked the boat""? by asking questions in the forum that no one would answer escpecially csm. i asked repeatedly if application was accepted and was repeatedly ignored. now without any preamble there is a vote with no debate no notice no nothing. one little msg when you sign on that says vote but for what? why should they when you have gone out of your way to make csm and the entire process hard to find and follow. so once again the majority will be trampled by the minority and given no choice in how the game is played? i wonder if anyone looked into the board of ccp if they would see **** cheney and bush running the show. this is their style of politics. frankly i never even dreamed anyone but myself would vote for me in the first place but to not even have my name listed is the lowest form of censourship there is and after reading and particapating in the forums it ptoves the contemp the old school csm and ccp has for anything or anyone new and the players of eve in general. their motto should be ""just give us your money to play the game and shut the hell up, we could care less what you think"".fly safely fly freeelf lord"

5/7/2010,"i am sure that the issue has been brought a number of times before but i wonder about your comment over the issue.i am talking about the amount of armor, shield, energy logistics have contributed to the battle. if the amount is recorded into the kill mails somehow then many players would enjoy flying logistics and this would result in much longer lasting and satisfying battles.this could basically be done by adding the player to the kill mail if he has repped a player who had aggro on the target/damage dealers in the km; same thing seems to work when repping someone in empire - then the repper gets aggro too.healing (or armor/shield rep as it is known in eve) and buffing (or warfare bonuses) are very old and well known concept in most of the mmorpg world.a wise developer would make people comfortable playing ""healers"" since this makes the game much more deeper and interesting for everybody.playing healing character is not that rewarding in most of the games (compared to the damage dealers) but in eve it is even worst. virtually you get no record for your contribution to the battle."
5/7/2010,"i would support any proposal to give ""healers"" in eve some recognition for their efforts. however i can't think of a reasonable way of doing it which wouldn't or couldn't result in killmail whoring. if you showed up on killmails for repping the guys who killed the target you would only have to pulse your reps once on the big damage dealers to show up. and if you showed up on the lossmail it'd be a ""welp"" situation since you obviously didn't heal the guy enough.again, i wouldn't reject either of these in hopes ccp could come up with a solution that works. the key here is creating a proposal which states that the playerbase wishes for repping to have some static proof of participation in eve and let the devs sort out the how.in nearly every mmo i've played i have personally played the healer role. i have many fond memories of epic battles in everquest with my cleric and also in wow with my priest. thank you for taking the time to ask this question, xdiakonu."

5/7/2010,"elorie liorden, i understand what your saying. ironically it is also the reason i do not have a lot of issues presented. the point of the csm is to put forward the players problems and fixes to ccp. the csm is not a place to promote the candidates personal vision and ignore everything else. not that i don't have my own ax to grind, i really really hate the font. i will be a major thorn in the side of ccp about that issue if i do get elected. that being said it is a topic that would benefit all players and not one group/type... unless there is someone out there that likes having a font that is illegible. i could throw up a lot of fluff but it would serve no purpose. perspective and attitude are the only thing that matters. for those who have served on the csm before they get the added benefit of a record showing action as well. all the chatter is mostly chaff so i just put the wheat up there to save everyone time, me included.i do thank you for your vote though. good luck and fly safe."

5/7/2010,"if you carry valuable stuff in empire you should never auto pilot through empire and if you do you accept the risk of being ganked by pirates. there's no need to increase penalties in such way, however, i would like to see suicide ganking in hi-sec made less attractive by having insurance pay out be decreased in case concord is involved.but pirates need to get something in return in a fair way and therefor low-sec should become more attractive to be in for miners, missioners, industrialists and pirates.currently 0.0 is more safe than empire!"

5/7/2010,ccp reps have said that forum upgrade should be happening following the release of eve-gate.
5/7/2010,"this is a good point, and has been clamored about for literally years now. however, ccp is already on this trail, and has been prodded in the past about it, with limited success. evegate is the next step in this evolution, and as mentioned by avalloc the forums are already on the assembly line immediately thereafter. nothing any csm delegate will do can improve this any further, so don't be fooled with promises of things already in motion.same goes for ""fix teh lag"" and ""answer my petitions now!"".i invite you to check out my campaign faq, in which these and other questions are answered, at my website below.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
5/7/2010,"the forum timer is a prime example of how serious you can take this.if you go and replace every other ""ccp promised to look into this"" with a ""ccp promised to continue to postpone this"" in the meeting minutes you are much closer to reality.""expectation management"" on ccp's side was an issue in the meeting minutes of the summit in iceland. the csm should go ahead and demonstrate what they ask of ccp and clearly state that none of this more than sweet talk unless there is something that suggests ccp is actually working on the issue (like assigning it to a specific release).furthermore i find the lack of follow ups disturbing.a recap and summary of the issues from the last meeting(s) should be part of every meeting.right now it mostly feels like a fire-and-forget approach which is not the most effective way imo. it suggests a lack of consistency and gives the appearance of talking about issues that are interesting/pressing/cool now but not caring about them later (even if that's not the case)."
5/7/2010,"do any of the candidates have any thoughts on anchoring/unanchoring times on pos modules? such as reactors, silos and moon harvester? 20 minutes a piece to unanchor is simply bogus!i hear certain timers were already addressed by ccp recently... and we're still left with this? lolmazzilliu plans to ""fix"" pos's... anyone know if these timers are part of this potential fix?"
5/7/2010,"pos unanchoring sucks.just as pos anchoring sucks.that is why, lately, i like simply blowing up pos mods of reds.saves them the time. saves us the time.win - win!seems the simple answer no?"
5/7/2010,lol yes simple indeed... though if you're the ones anchoring/having to modify your pos setups...it's a huge annoyance. pos's aren't involved in sov warfare anymore so i honestly don't see why completing such tasks should be so time consuming causing the player to enjoy the game much less during those hours spent.

5/8/2010,"i like your ideas. :) suicide ganking should really be suicidal: no seventy virgins for the ganker, just oblivion.the problem with these so-called 'intended game-mechanics' is that all y'all keep massively abusing them. and then ccp has to nerf them. ""let's make a mwd,"" ccp thought. and then folks began to fit multiple instances, getting up to ridiculous speeds. so ccp had to rein in your abusive behavior. same with shield/mods, bcu's, etc. in general, the whole 'stacking penalty' system had to be introduced because people always seek to push the envelope of intended game mechanics. i think it's pretty sleasy, but maybe it's just human nature.same with suicide ganking: ccp makes you pay a security penalty for doing so. and, instead of doing it less, you find inventive ways around it, like creating disposable destroyer pilots. this is your nature. so be it. but fact also is, that every time you abuse an 'intended game-mechanic,' ccp will have to nerf you. because 'fair use' to most constitutes finding the absolute limit of where abusing a mechanic become absolute illegal, and then operating just 1 notch under that and yelling 'intended game-mechanics!'so, i say it's time ccp finally bring down the hammer on suicide ganking. not saying it should be disallowed, but they should stop allowing you to be abuse the system to get past the imposed penalties. which is to say, at the very least, 0 insurance pay-out when shot down by concord, and banning people who use disposable accounts to avoid taking sec damage hits."

5/8/2010,"i don't like the idea of a fast brutix or astarte.the reason for this basically has to do with overlap into the realm of cruisers. if you make the brutix fast then you can achieve cruiser speed/agility with bc type hit points. even if its low bc type hit points. don't get me wrong, you can, already and that is a problem. if the thorax isn't going to have a range advantage on the brutix then the brutix and astarte need to be slow.the core concern for a battlecuiser is being a ""heavy"" cruiser. and so the speed of the astarte and brutix are only really necessary so long as they can catch bc's. and they pretty much can already. the problem with the brutix is that it is simply not hardy enough compared to the other bc's"
5/8/2010,support for sexyness
5/8/2010,10% is too much. 9% is a much better figure. also the rep amount bonus needs to be changed to rep amount and remote rep recieved
5/8/2010,"agreed, a brutix shouldn't have cruiser agility/speed.blaster boats have more lows than meds. sounds fair. but you need speed and agility to be efficient with blaster boats; so it's preferable to have:a passive shield tank: not enough meds considering scram & web is quite compulsory.an active armor tanking: the rigs screw your speed, and cap injector is neededcould we leave blasters in their current form, and balance:- blasters ships slot layout / bonuses (active armor bonus) ?- armor rig downsides ?decreasing the mass of these ships would be nice too, but might be too difficult to implement, without creating nano-overpowered boats."
5/8/2010,"yes, balance the blaster boats themselves first. they should be very fast, maybe even the fastest ships in their class, but only in a straight line. give them a lot of inertia or something so they can charge at enemy ships at very high speed but cannot turn very tightly. this will mean that minnie ships retain their racial feel of very high agility and speed."
5/8/2010,"think on this buttercup: caldari won't hasve to gimp their tank to put nanos and overdrives in the lows, to get their speed up. also still able to put mwd/ab, tackling mods, and a respectable tank in their large midslot layout. as for tracking clicking aproach or keep at range virtually cancles out tracking issues. therefore buffing blasters is a stealth buff for caldari, not gallente."
5/8/2010,omg i havent read such stupidity in a long time.can put nanos and overdrives in to the lows? realy?:o come on 1-2 lows just go to reactor controls and it have left with 2-3 for magstabs not nano/overdrives.large midslot layout?:o where you need 1 mwd 2 tackler gear 1 cap booster and you left with 1 med slot.any blaster boost wouldnt make caldari hybrid boats op with blaster fits.if you realy think caldari blaster ships are that awesome then bring out your blaster fitted eagle for a trip.i bet you never have flown any caldari ships.

5/8/2010,"tl;dr (but kinda read some of it)first off i think the argument that it makes the haves better and the have nots have less is completely pointless but also completely true.""omg the older players do more damage then the younger players, well now thats not fair"" seriously stfu, if someone wants to train to t2 weapons it should give them an advantage just liked someone training recon to 5 not to 4. t2 and in tech 2 should be more advanced than tech 1, faction should be more advanced than tech 2. reasoning is pretty obvious, tech one being basic tech should never equal tech 2 lets call that cutting edge, and faction is what the military or navy would use, assuming that they usually bankroll the big research companies and develop most of the tech you would assume their guns would be t2+ more as they are advancing the cutting edge tech. officer/deadspace stuff is would be prototype gear stuff that is rare and in small quantity compared to their faction and t2 counterparts.with that said ammo should stack up as such imo t1<worst faction<t2<militart< best faction.considering t1 is then readily available to everyone and has limited experience required (making shells in your garage). worst faction would be more expensive and a lil bit better like last years model. t2 would be cutting edge distributed ammo it costs you a pretty penny but its basically what the military uses. military grade ammo would be slightly better than t2 assuming the military made slight modifications and changes to it for their use. best faction would be spec ops style ammo, made in special shops precise recipes with hard ingredients super costly but does the job better than anything else. now consider t2 is the best cutting edge ammo released by the states for mass production. if it was a **** product that all in all punished the user noone would use it, and someone would come out with something better and release it for mass distribution. ok so back to the age argument:why shouldnt older players have the advantage.... lets re-word thiswhy shouldnt players that choose to train certain skills further or more extensively not get rewarded when compared to players who didn't train those skills. if someone wants to train to t2 guns and ammo and then fights someone who didnt want to train to those should he not have the advantage. shouldn't the t2 ship be quiet superior to the t1 basic ship and slightly superior to the best named (as well as being much more cost effective,) ship. so we assume t2 ammo only works in t2 guns cause the guns are able to handle special ammos that might not be stable in t1 guns or might need special primers or firing triggers that arent in the t1 model. wouldn't you then also assume that these modified slugs/rounds must also have a decent added benefit to firing them if they are higher tech then similar lower tech rounds. the description of hail ammo the hail is an attempt to combine the penetration of titanium sabot with the versatility of a depleted uranium shell. it consists of a fairly large titanium sabot shell with a payload of depleted uranium submunitions. it has tremendous damage potential, but should not be used at long ranges. any pilot using this ammunition should be prepared to trade optimal range and capacitor energy for increased tracking speed and a devastating amount of damage.it is both tit sabot and depeleted uranium, 2 tech 1 ammos.shouldnt be fired at long range, and drains capacitor (assuming its to do something to the ammo)in exchange should get increased tracking and devastating damage.sounds fair but the tracking is a penalty in game?hail ~ 50% optimal penalty, 50% falloff penalty, -50% tracking penalty 5% increased cap recharge"
5/8/2010,"quake descriptiona large titanium sabot shell that delivers a shattering blow to the target. it is however nearly twice as bulky as standard ammunition and has a somewhat slower rate of fire. the tremendous recoil generated by this shell means that the ship's velocity must be substantially curbed and a small portion of the ship's capacitor energy redirected to manuvering thrusters for stability.so in exchange for a heavy slug the pilotless shots in the gun, slower fire rate, slower speed.in exchange more damage ( with the description should be alot more damage) also if the ship is slower and more stable tracking should be increased just a thought...conflagthe conflagration is a supercharged x-ray crystal created by carthum conglomerate for the imperial navy. has much greater damage potential than the standard version, but needs considerably more capacitor and also has reduced effective range.better magnification on crystal means hotter stronger beam, but pilot losestracking and optimal go out the window and it costs a bunch more power to fire through. but you get lots more damage. (really dont see how tracking is effected by the crystal tho)gleamthe gleam overdrive crystal has tremendous damage capacity but needs substantially more energy than normal and its energy signature is very easy to lock onto. it also requires the ship's shields to be strengthened around the turret to prevent critical backlasheswell pilot losescapacitor and signatur is huge but more damage and shields should be strengthened.(but according to bonus's shields are weakened.... interesting so either shields are specifically strengthened around the turrets only at which point they could probably over heat for longer or the ships shields as a whole are increased at cost of capacitor) javelinthe javelin charge consists of a cluster of iridium fletchets with a graviton pulse detonator. this allows for much higher damage than can be achieved by a standard rail system. however, the inherent entropy of graviton pulses means that it is very hard to maintain accuracy at long range.according to the description pilot loses accuracy (optimal and tracking) in exchange for much more damage, but they get hammered with a speed penalty why?finally voidthe void xenon charge is a high-powered blaster charge that delivers an extremely powerful blast of kinetic energy. however, it has several serious drawbacks, most notably the fact that it requires considerably more capacitor energy than any other blaster charge. it also needs to maintain a clean aim for a slightly longer time than normal.pilot gets a lot of damage at the cost of rate of fire and more capacitor use. what do i think bonus's should be according to description imot2 ammos should be as such (imo)close range gun close range ammo: reduced range, damage bonus, tracking bonus.long range ammo: range bonus*2, damage penalty(rof), accuracy penalty.long range gunclose range ammo: reduces range, increases damage*2, reduced speed.long range ammo : increased range, reduced damage, increased trackingessentially what you get is ammo that is meant for the guns purpose does it well, while the other ammo that is opposite compensates for the lacking but doesn't do well to compete with its competitor in the other class.close range ammo (for long range gun) gets a bonus to damage at close range cause well makes sense a large bonus if its doing decent damage at long distance if you get hit by it at close range, damn it should hurt, but those guns turn slow.long range ammo ( short range gun) ammos designed to make up for the guns inherent flaws in distance fighting but in such sacrifices damage (rof).in the end the ammo types for the specific guns should be unparalleled in their niche close range to close range and long range to long range, and make up for the slack in the weaknesses by sacrificing its strengths when it comes to long range to close range and vice versa."

5/8/2010,"you're missing it. invention wasn't supposed to replace bpos, it was supposed to turn ridiculously high profits into moderate ones. it has succeeded in this beyond anyone's greatest expectations, and actually gone further, turning ridiculously high profits into below-average ones in most cases.t2 bpos are about 5th or 6th on the list of things that make the most money in this game. suggest you try the first five.the lottery was unfair, but those cheques have been cashed. now you are left with people who paid good isk for items that removing would be fundamentally less fair, than continuing to allow new players a goal to strive towards. every inventor can easily replace the output of multiple bpos. there are over 10,000 t2 bpos, there are tens of thousands of inventors. inventors keep inventors out of the market by working to lower and lower margins as they continually become more efficient at it.alchemy didn't at all address rare moons in the way t2 bpos have already been addressed though invention. alchemy moons can be attacked, just like rare moons. bpos can remain safe, just like invention. on the other hand, any t2 bpo owner who needs to come close to making a return within a decade, needs to use a pos array, making them vulnerable to attack, and also reducing the efficiency of their bpo to worse than the me-1 possible with invention for a lower investment.the market is already functioning properly, it's just that you do not want to pay what others have for the same thing, you would rather kick over their sandcastle than spend time building one.i have a hemorphite mining crystal ii bpo, i bought it, many years ago, and have not built off it for several years, as they currently sell for 75% of the bpo build cost (and sadly do not refine to their component parts). i would stand to gain heavily though removal of t2 bpos, because i have quite a stock, in fact, i could solo supply the market for this item for many years, and without other bpos out there, i would make much more isk than owning the bpo or selling it, would ever make.removal of bpos wouldn't gain anything for people who do not have one, not a single isk. invention profit is the least amount of isk people are willing to accept, and no more. you see this when every time a new item is introduced, the market floods with inventors, and then dissipates as profits evaporate in increasingly small time frames.the problem is simply a psychological one. someone else has something, they worked hard for it, you do not want to do the same, so they shouldn't have it either, even though you gain no benefit at all in the destruction of their hard work."
5/8/2010,"i have one t2 bpo, which actually never fills any slot because it's not worth building off. meanwhile i fill 50-60 production slots at all times, and could potentially fill 30 more if i honestly wanted to spend the rl time.very few people who have t2 bpos have enough to fill all their production slots. there are more people with t2 bpos that make no isk at all than there are people with more than a handful of them.most t2 bpos are less profitable occupying a slot than occupying that same slot with invented bpcs or something t1. only the very few make 'reasonable' profits, and those sell for the profit they would otherwise make in the better part of a decade.i have done this with my t2 bpo, because you actually lose money to build off it, selling a bpc for 'anything' is better than that.i don't know of any t2 bpos that are only going for 3 years profit, most are 7-10 years of continuous building at a pos array. honestly, do you think there is any difference between retaining bpos, and converting them into 10 years worth of bpcs? your advantage is only going to come after 10 years if it was one really big bpc, and you will shoot invention in the foot if you convert them into multiple bpcs which allow people to do their production in parallel.there actually isn't a limit at all, as long as the profit you are making exceeds the cost of buying gtcs, you can have infinite slots going. this is why invention profits for casual inventors don't look super great, they're competing against people that only need to make about 13,000 isk/hr per slot to break even, anything about that is profit.no they wouldn't, the effective level of t2 bpos is less than -1 me as they need to be built at rapid facilities to generate the amount of isk for even 5-10 year break even points. invention, which is low risk, low investment would be 'better' than the bpos. not to mention there would be less profit in invention because it would be easier. so what you are saying, is that t2 bpos are overpriced, and not worth how much people pay for them. isn't that an argument for boosting them? if they're not worth it, then surely the can't be overpowered, given the disparity being argued is one of cost, and not utility, since the end product is the same."

5/8/2010,"i have been looking at various threads dealing with ganking/griefing/etc and possible solutions/improvements. some seemed promising. some seemed like buckets of tears from people who got ganked. others seemed to be just unworkable and unpopular.let me start by stating i don't have a horse in this race. i haven't been griefed, ganked or abused. i don't gank, grief, etc. this is just an idea i had, and wanted to see what would come from some informed discussion. i make no claims to all the knowledge and experience required to know if this is workable. that is why i am putting it up... for input.---------------------------------proposal ....any hisec attack that does damage and triggers a concord response to a player will result in the attacking player's pod being tractored into a concord ship and taken to the nearest station and thrown in eve jail.this is not a ban.the player's pod is in a hanger with limited access to player gui. player may send and receive mail, que any skills currently injected, chat in all chats.player may not clone jump or access any items.36 hours for 1st offense.72 hours for 2nd offense within 30 days of first offense.96 hours for 3rd and all subsequent offenses.30 days with no offenses resets the clock.any other characters in that account may be accessed during this period.personally i would give the 'inmate' access to a way to write graphitti on the walls of his 'cell' hanger for the next schlub that gets locked up to read.----------------------------------------tyrannis is fixing insurance, so no need to void that for attacks.banning is just meh in my book, unless it is an actual hack/etc..charging real money(one proposal) to griefers is just wayyy out there.i can see why some like to go after macrominers and other afkers, but the current system also allows large gangs to suicide gank mission runners as they undock, along with other gang related suicides. if every player in that gang got tossed in the brig, then we may have the ganking go back to more 1v1 anti-macro ganking.this idea changes no other mechanic, it just makes for more of a decision on the part of the ganker(s).do the crime... do the time. is that ship full of bpcs worth it? if yes, then fire away.the largest impact i can see on 'legal' players is to the niche group that sits near known suiciders to kill their pods after concord kills their ships. no more of that if the pod is in custody of the cops.i would welcome informed and sane debate and discussion. flames, and replies like ""go play hello kitty' will not impress anyone. like i said, i don't have a dog in this hunt... it's just an idea and i couldn't care less if it is implemented or not.--------------------------"
5/8/2010,wut?ganking/griefing/etc is working as intended as stated by ccpi could see no insurance working but anything limiting peoples ability to play the game is a bad idea. all further ganking/etc would be dependant on people having specialized alts and the time loss probly wouldnt mean much once people who already gank had time to compensate for the change.

5/8/2010,supported with one addition which i think will work against macro. if pilot who lost the ship reports incident during next 5 minutes.it is logical to end up in jail if police got you.i think developers support suicide ganking moslty as a tool against macro-miners.

5/8/2010,sounds good to me!
5/8/2010,"stupid idea, another matar boost as those have the fastest lock + sensor booster gets even better that 1 module would be too good vs both damping and ecm, alpha strike ships would be less effected thats another matar arty boost againthis could only work if you remove raciality of ecm-schange sensor strenght according to scan resolutionslike lower matars sensor strenghth by 30-40%and still little frigs would be too resistant vs ecm"
5/8/2010,"sensor booster is already ""good"" vs both damps and jams, in the manner that the faster you can lock people after a jam cycle, the more rr/dps can you lay down. it's just to a lesser extent. some people even now fit sensor boosters instead of eccm because of this, since once you get jammed, you can't do anything, so you want to lock people back up asap.the fact that matari has good lock times has nothing to do with this. they're also more vulnerable to jamming, since they tend to have a lower sensor strenght, thus would be more affected by this, and would have to gain lock more often. i'd say that would be pretty balanced.frigs will be able to lock faster, as they already do. however, this would mean that frigs have to be on toe and actually focus on the tackling bit. if they don't, they'll not be able to make use of their native high scan resolution. also, since frigs generally has very low sensor strength, who's to say they will keep lock for more than 5-10 sec at any given time? all you need is for them to lose lock once. it would also mean they can do their job of getting initial tackle, then let it go when a bigger, more powerful ship take over. then it can move on to the next target, and work on holding that down.all this should balance itself out quite nicely. as is ecm is a bit too strong, as it locks you down for an extended period of time. as a sidenote, mixing damps with jams would be more ""appropriate"" since the effect of a damp would more often come into place. this because the process of locking would occur more often. this in turn might give someone a reason to field the beloved eos? (ok,ok, i know, the eos sucks, i was just making a joke )i'm biased obviously, but i really believe this is a system that would make a more challenging and ""better"" ecm combat experience. both from the people doing the jamming, and the people walking out to buy a new keyboard after sitting jammed until they can out of cap boosters and died .edit: regarding artillery boost:if you're fighting artillery ships, and you're inside jamming range, you better be moving really, really fast, or hug them. in any case, artillery already have a cycle time of roughly 20 sec, so if anything you're doing them a favour by jamming them. keeps them fresh on toe as they have to work every time they fire guns. instead of letting them go num and bored tripping while waiting for the long (word for a part of your body you sit on) cycle time. and yes, i fly artillery ships. wouldn't buff them in any way, due to the nature of the long cycle times in the first place."
5/8/2010,"just look at sniper hurricanes 900-1000 scan res, 8.2sec rof. even if it gets jammed each 5 sec it would still be able to fire its guns.this change would completly make those invulnerable vs ecms.see it would be another matar boost.anyway currently ecm ships only jamms tacklers if they want to disengage which happens when they are outblobbed.this change would only help the blobs.i realy cant see how this change would be any good."
5/8/2010,"it's not a boost to matari alone. all cruiser sized guns have a short rof. this would enable everyone to get more shots off. when you're talking bs's, it's actually more of a buff to everyone else, as they have much shorter rof than matari has. matari remains more or less unchanged.everything you do will to some degree favor the blob. there's really nothing you can do against greater numbers other than outplay them by being smart, or fitting better. look at it this way. you have ten people, the ""blob has thirty. amongst those thirty are there 3 falcons, 2 blackbirds and 2 scorpions. this is not totally unrealistic. now, with the combined jams they have, as the game stands currently, they can shut your entire gang down completely, and kill every single last one of you without you getting off one shot. this means it'll have to be a worst case scenario, but it can happen.making it so jams don't shut your targeting system off for an extended period of time, will in most cases favor the side with the least numbers of pilots. now, if you say that jams are changed, and you can get lock again: let's say your gang of 10 has 6 hacs, 2 logis and 2 recons. the hostile gang has the mentioned ewar, add 6 bs, 6 bcs and some mixed tackle. now you actually stand a chance of fighting them, by getting lock on their tackle, and kill them. your logis can regain lock (they have high scan res too you know) and save you when you're primary. with the tackle down, you can safely move off, and start picking them off one by one, or leave at will.if you think a little, instead of just automaticly saying that ""blobs win because of this"", you'll come to see that it's not always the blob that benefits from changes."
5/8/2010,"i think you are understating the effect it has against few targets, but then that prevents it from sounding like a whine (i should know, i do quite a lot of whining on this topic ) so i guess that is a good thing.i do need some clarification:do you want the sensor:strength ratio to remain the same (ie. one jammer knocking out a frigate hull almost permanently)?one module can jam one ship at a time or multiple (the section comparing it to ecm burst is not clear)?do you want it to keep its chance based nature?what do you want to do with eccm if this is done (sebos will be just as good on bs)?have you thought about what to do with ecm drones?i would propose a change to eccm to go with this lock-breaker mechanic.each eccm allows you to designate one auto-target similar to tagging on overview. when jam is ""lifted"" the ship immediately begins reacquiring said target(s).provides a tangible benefit to fitting eccm by giving you a 'head start' and reduces the click-fest that lockbreaking brings to the table. would also address my own pet peeve, that of light ships being jammed by practically anything with an ecm module.@naomi: the threat of the alpha will always be present, it is what it does. alpha specialised ships will lock faster than an ecm boat anyway so the first volley will land regardless of a successful jam.what i see it means is that ecm will no longer be the ultimate ewar in a conflict as it adds tremendous value to dampening and td's .. the artillery hurricane for instance, for all its power has a very narrow lock-range/weapon-range envelope to work with reducing either will make it just another ship waiting to be disposed of.that said, changing ecm system to include scan resolution (for relock) does warrant a look at the various ships statistics and tweaking the ones that might break-the-system."
5/8/2010,good ideaallso boost eccm and take the ecm drones into line there so overpowered >_<
5/8/2010,"it shouldn't disrupt a frigate permanently, no. however, it should make it hard for the frig to keep a lock at all times. if you manage to disrupt it once every 5 second or so, it should be fine, just make the frigate work for it. then again, it's still chance based, so you might miss for 60 seconds, just like today.as said, i want to keep the chance based nature with the formula of sensor strength ratios.for the eccm, i believe it should still be just sensor strenght. if you change the ratio in the formula to calculate it, it may be much harder to get a jam, so that the eccm is more beneficial to fit than a sensor booster. alternativly, they can stay as they are, and an eccm makes more sense on a smaller ship, like a cruiser/frigate hull, while a senosr booster is better on something like a battleship. this should already balance itself out quite nicely as is. i see sensor boosters fitted on interceptors very often, when in fact it does very little to nothing for the ship. an eccm would benefit it more if ecm would work like proposed. edit: basicly, ships with native high sensor strength can rely on sensor boosters while ships with nativly high scan resolution can rely on eccm. the entire eccm issue is hard to address however. one might also add a third option of a module that does a slight of both? one could even make scripts for it and have a joint module. if so the cycle time would need to be rather long to prevent scripting all the time you needed it, say 30 sec cycle time. this is just theorycrafting however. the eccm issue is a bit harder to give a proper workaround to. but i believe that keeping them just as they are today would actually be best. this would encourage the use of eccm on smaller ships and sensor boosters on bigger ships. this in turn would reduce the ""instalockingalphawtfpwn"" fits some are afriad of to a certain degree. one would need eccm over scan resolution on gatecamping artycanes just in case, or a mix of both. this is a matter that needs more discussing however. for a last theorycrafting ""what the hell"" idea, an eccm module could work as a buffer on your targeting system so to speak. it would store the targeting information you have in a backup sensor, and you'll only lose lock on a certain amount of your locked targets. say if you have 6 targets locked, you lose lock on 4 of them. this can be random, so that you can lose lock on the one you're agressing, everyone but the person you're agressing, or all targets all together. basicly, if you're flying without an eccm, and the ecm boats get a successful hit, you lose lock regardless. if you fly with an eccm, you stand a chance of keeping lock on one/multiple of your locked targets. this again would be chance based, but the chance would be there to remain lock one at least one target. (this is completely theory and i expect nothing postive from it, just throwing it out there) regarding ecm drones, i think they should have either the same effect, or a very much shortened effect of that wich we have today. say a 5 sec cycle per jam. this can be validated saying that the drones have a more powerful jamming mechanism since it's short range based (or something along those lines). just as long as they don't stay as powerful as they are today.the ecm modules itself would work exactly like they do today, with one target/module (sorry if that wasn't clear enough)."
5/8/2010,"easy enough to for the extremes, but what of all the hulls in between frigates and bs .. there are numerous cruisers and some bcs where it is a toss-up which will result in sebos being the answer in 100% of cases due to overall usefulness, you risk ending up with a system where eccm only has value on frigates with everything else being better off using sebos .. that is why i think there has to be a noticeable (but limited) benefit to fitting eccm.would need to exclude ecm ship itself from the list of potential ""kept locks"" or it will be too harsh on them .. but then the benefit becomes as intangible as as that of tp's (worse even if chance based).ps: pardon me for nagging, like i said it is a pet peeve of mine so i have spent a lot of time going through all the permutations .. just trying to help you polish a good idea"
5/8/2010,"np i fully admit that making eccm viable in any form is a huge task in it's own. i agree that the ecm boat needs to get unlocked regardless in case of a successful hit. as to the entire eccm module, i'm really unsure what would be best. i do believe making them more or less unchanged would end up being best. make it so that they are more effective, adn they'll see a role. lots of work on that part tho."
5/8/2010,"i support this, something needs to be done about ecm."
5/8/2010,"i can't support this, it would just make ecm useless. as it is right now, it can indeed turn a battle if you fail to counter it (1 single ship in range will quickly take one down), but that is the point, that is what it's supposed to be able to do. ecm does not need a nerf - the other e-war need a boost so that they can be as effective as ecm is now. what does need to be changed though is the total shut down effect of ecm. getting jammed should not mean sitting there for 20 seconds not being ableto do anything but move. i'd like ecm to be changed to be chance based in an another way: it should have x% chance (still decided by your jam strength vs target sensor strength) to jam each individual module that need to be activated on a target. that should mean that you are pretty much guaranteed to shut off some of the other guys guns/tackle/ewar/rr, but at the same time, the other guy will almost always have atleast some of his modules still working, so he can continue fighting.that change should not change the efficency of ecm much, but it allows for adding a stacking penalty to ecm like with other ewar (each additional jammer on a target has a lower % chance to jam the remaining unjammed mods) and instead of sitting there being bored, ecm becomes a fun challenge, in the same way that damps and tracking disruptors are. you will have to find a way to keep fighting and stay effective with a limited amount of offensive modules remaining, and it adds an interesting balance it fitting choices, like dedicated tackle ships maybe fitting extra points or something in order to still have backups in case 1 gets jammed."
5/8/2010,i made this exact proposal a few months back and i still think it's a good idea.
5/8/2010,nice.
5/8/2010,"epic win, sir. i fully support this proposal."
5/8/2010,"you realize a shorter jam cycle makes an ecm ship more effective? the timer being set to 20 secs. was considered a nerf to ecm, when it was changed from 5 secs..there's potential to take many more ship's targeting offline in the same time period. fit some signal amps to your falcon, for more locked targets. instead of taking ~ 3 - 5 ships out of the fight, you can cycle-jam 9 or more. this could bring the scorp back to popularity, as weaker jam strength would mean less, if you have 4 times more opportunity. i always did like the scorp.. supported"

5/8/2010,local allows me to solo pvp - aggressed a target and you see local spiking? gtfo!local is one of the few ways you can lull the enemy forces into a sense of security to get a small gang fight.it seems like the pvp you want to get just involves ganking ratters/plexers. getting that is not worth nerfing pvp between entities who are looking for actual fights.
5/8/2010,"it is evident that developers trying to find a way to make nulsec more accessible, your proposal might work in oposite direction.some ppl avoiding wh-space for the way local works in-there.not supported."
5/8/2010,basically.
5/8/2010,"i'll assume that ccp rejected your application because your incoherent rantings on the forums indicate that you don't understand this mmo.why would they accept you as a csm candidate if you can't form a coherent argument, format your posts into separate paragraphs, argue objectively, and argue from facts instead of opinions. try working on those skills for the next csm elections.just because your application as a candidate for csm was rejected, doesn't mean the election is rigged."
5/8/2010,ya i saw that but they didn't even have the curtisy to tell me why they rejected my application. nor did they allow me to fix what ever problems there were in the application. not very democratic is it?but since you are one of the normally chosen few why am i not suprised at your atrtitude. good luck in the election.fly freeelf lord
5/8/2010,"maybe because you have used a character with a name very similar to elvenlord, created after he was elected to the csm, so giving the impression that it was created only to siphon some vote away from him in the next election?"
5/8/2010,"there might have been something wrong with your passport, or something bad in your history that required moderation. thus, disqualified.also, lrn2paragraph. /not supported."
5/8/2010,maybe if you learned to type properly they would have been able to read your application.
5/8/2010,wait...does that mean i'm an eve a-lister? crap that means i'll have to sign up for that arrogant ramblings class.
5/8/2010,it's simple: because they don't have to tell you. plus this rant would have far more content if they had told you.
5/8/2010,support
5/8/2010,ok ... it doesnt even work in hangars (where it would be reaaaaaally helpful) and you expect it to work on killmails?
5/8/2010,'ghm.. could that mean that in needs to be fixed? no way...
5/8/2010,"i fully support this ""little"" thing, to distinguish bpo & bpc in general more clearly, and more especially in killmails, as there's definitely a serious difference value-wise...if you value giving priority to little fixes like this, vote for cinori aluben. my priority is that ccp make these ""little things"" a priority. as such small items wouldn't require heavy coding time, devoting dev time to them is solely a matter of prioritization, which the csm will have an active part in now.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
5/8/2010,"as a full time inventor i would not be averse to a slow degradation of decryptors, as profit calculations could be taken into account on the invention process. i also agree that more uses should be found for the plethora of items recovered from all exploration sites outside of w-space. currently they just pile up and collect dust... i long ago stopped bothering with anything other than complexes and gravis.i am not willing to accept any proposed changes to t2 bpos without some manner of remuneration to those who have gone to the trouble of purchasing them."
5/8/2010,"make a lot of sense when u think about it, lets say 100 new players join daily and continue eve past trial and wish to inventnow when over 200 data interface things are created and gotten daily price drops.eventually they will be worthless as they are almost never lost."
5/8/2010,"you're being disingenuous. when do interfaces ever need to leave stations?exploration is possibly the only area where profit actually does go upwards with decreasing sec (like it's supposed to for everything), so if someone's risking lowsec or 0.0, why not reward them for it? i'm guessing the super-high prices come from high-end faction loot drops, from complexes that need multiple people to run (plus the disruption of having to safecloak whenever probes show up)."
5/8/2010,"the ships that go boom are normally pvp, or in worst cases pve fit. i don't know about you, but i do not go to fight people in an indie full of datacores and decryptors. neither do i carry them around in my ishtar's cargohold, if i have free cargo i put in quafe and exottic dancers, but not datacores."
5/8/2010,this. the amounts of isk form 0.0 exploration come from high-end combat plexes and sweet sweet deadspace loot. radar sites have nothing to do with those values.
5/8/2010,supported.another ccp fail that needs to be fixed.
5/8/2010,"here's an idea i'd like to put forward for possible examination. the ability for users to run active testing while in regular game play for ccp to use when looking for bottlenecks in the system.by activating the /test command the following monitoring capabilities would activate.a snapshot of active threads and/or services loaded.system output hardware (audio & video, number of video cards & their ram, number of monitors in use, and number of clients active).cpu capacity & loadram capacity & loadpacket propagation.location(s) - system, number of pilots in the system (docked & undocked), client input idle time and any other relevant location data ccp would deem useful information.# of hops to server from client & average latency.this data would be stored entirely client side in an encrypted data file until the /endtest command was entered. it would then send the compiled file to a ccp storage server for examination.with as many datapoints as players could provide it would increase the amount of information ccp would have available when looking for bugs or other issues that affect client efficiency."
5/8/2010,you mean like this?
5/8/2010,"yes, but something far less complicated to initialize and that can be turned on or off by the user from within the client easily."
5/8/2010,"this is a good idea that would make ccp more money. win/win? sometimes i don't log into an account for a few weeks, once they expire paying via isk becomes irritating, thus getting a heads up is very helpful."
5/8/2010,"yes. yes.and yes.suggestions have been made to have an automated email sent to you, an automated evemail sent, and a pop-up in game 48 & 24hrs before sub ends. seriously, this is such a ""little"" thing, and would avoid so much aggravation on the players' parts. it would also save a lot of gms time giving temp reactivations (therefore allowing them to focus on other petitions). it'd also avoid having peoples' subs lapse for a few days at a time (figure just 1,000 instances of this per month out of the 300k players, for just one day = 1000days unpaid game time = 33 subs = $500 us), so ccp would actually gain money off this idea too...if you value giving priority to little fixes like this, vote for cinori aluben. my priority is that ccp make these ""little things"" a priority. as such small items wouldn't require heavy coding time, devoting dev time to them is solely a matter of prioritization, which the csm will have an active part in now.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
5/8/2010,"this aint your ""im sick of wardec"" thread. if you want it, look elsewhere.so... ever get the feeling of lazyness when you wardec a corp with over 50 people. you just want a list of all its members somewhere on your screen ? well maybe its too exagerated for a feature but i'm pretty this would be useful.if you think its too ridiculous cause you have the advantage to know who's in corp well, your already in corp anyway with some roaming around, checking the killboards, google the corp name or some things like that will get you on a beacon somewhere so why not cut that work with 1 easy feature.when you wardec someone, there should be a tab in people & places which would be named wardec and you see all your corporation wardec members. would cut lots of intel work for people i know and concentrate on killing them instead."
5/8/2010,as you said ... it is already possible ... so if you want that kind of intel... work for it.it shouldnt be free.not supported.
5/8/2010,"you arte getting that in eve gate- you can see members of a corp. you can check what corp a pilot is in now. logically, it should work other way too- what pilots are in a corp."
5/8/2010,damn straight.
5/8/2010,it will be optional in eve-gate. and i would guess any decent ceo will switch it off.
5/8/2010,"if what people say here about eve-gate then your screwed. time to get your whining lvl 5 active in the forum bud lolbut i was just thinking on how to make neuts spy useless. and i was thinking about a fit for my domi. so i went on battleclinic for some info and i saw this domi with arties...seems like a good fit but only problem is the bonuses to the ship...its not with arties. so if ccp could allow players to change bonuses to some extent (not any bonus of course) then neutral player would become useless in a way.think about it. your on a field with all your ships, domi's, mega's, drake's and all those ships but the bonuses are so different that even if you spy tells you what ship is there on the field, your fleet could get own ed in no time probably cause the bonuses can make a huge difference."
5/8/2010,"last i checked, eve is dozens or hundreds of real servers ( not crappy dell desktops), connected to create one universe."
5/8/2010,"do you know what a ""server"" is? do you have the slightest clue how tranquility is set up?"
5/8/2010,"the eve ""server"" consists of tens of millions of dollars worth of hardware. you do not leave spares of those lying around."
5/8/2010,name one game that has a 100% redundant server infrastructure for several thousand players.then explain me how a failing database script has anything to do with a backup server and how redundancy would have solved that.
5/8/2010,"mass persecution? no.i liked the tournament, i liked pl's performance and i will not allow some crying ****er to mouth off and discredit a good performance.deal with cheaters on the side. it is just a game. and get a ***ing life."
5/8/2010,"i agree. +1in reality, though, people already won't look at their title the same any more as before.ultimately, really ccp is to blame: they don't seem to care at all: cheating, macro-mining, as long as the involved parties are large enough to show up on their revenue-radar, they turn a blind eye."
5/8/2010,"simple. genius.also, it would be nice to know, at a glance, what meta level an item is (maybe make a column in the detailed view for it)."
5/8/2010,"i'm sure there are csm5 applicants that support this other than me, but it was okay'd already by ccp and so this maybe why its not listed in their agendas.-t'amber"
5/8/2010,yes!
5/8/2010,"i approve of this idea, though i suspect it would need to be very carefully planned to maintain balance, it could prove especially tricky in that regard."
5/8/2010,"so being a part of the csm is therefore not being employed in a capacity by ccphere is a definition of an employee, ""a person who is hired to provide services to a company on a regular basis in exchange for compensation and who does not provide these services as part of an independent business"".1.did ccp create the roles of the csmanswer: yes2. did ccp define the roles and requirements that a csm must abide by?answer: yes3. did ccp conduct an interview processanswer: yes they did. they did it through the process of an election to nominate the candidates for the position.3. does ccp expect that a csm representative provide them with services on a regular basisanswer: yes. whilst you are a csm, ccp expects that you uphold to your commitments as a csm representative.4. does the csm receive compensation for the services that they provideanswer: yes. what part of free flight, hotel stay and free access to the fan fest equals5.does the csm provide services as part of an independent businessanswer: no as the csm is a designated role created by and organized by ccp.also i would not be surprised if the csm are covered under the iceland equivalent of the oh&s act and probably workers compensation if they are injured whilst they attend the fan fest. therefore i do not see any problem with any individual putting there role as csm as part of there employment history.brechan"
5/8/2010,burn the witch
5/8/2010,"oh please give me proof she is an exploiter. (and please dont come with a screenie where she has a cloaking device fitted, that isnt an exploit).and looking at your posts you arent really in any position to talk about anyones mental competence.i just agree with most of her points, try to deal with it. also she isnt lying and twisting facts, in case you didnt notice, she has been in the csm."
5/8/2010,"try to use your common sense instead of playing semantics.this topic in the cv tells 'i have been working for two years for a gaming company as a some kind of junior game designer/ whatever'whereas it is 'i was elected along with other players, to raise issues from the game i play to developers. they offered me a free trip to iceland, and they paid me an hotel room. oh, and i was elected twice.'would have been appropriate to put this under 'pasttimes & associative work'. lacks honesty, and modesty."
5/8/2010,"omg quick call the police, no wait get on the bat phone - no no no no hang on - its such a major crime against humanity the world police will get involved oh the humanity :) teamamerica will obviously get involved in this one"
5/8/2010,"well put. personally i'm more concerned with the honesty part than the modesty thing. cvs are your sales pitch to other companies, most everyone will take what they have and make themselves into rocket scientists in some capacity. however, usually staying within the realm of reality.it's also worth adding emphasis to the previous guy's definition of the word ""employee"":""a person who is hired to provide services to a company on a regular basis in exchange for compensation and who does not provide these services as part of an independent business""everything after that is just a further description."
5/8/2010,"voted for you with 9 accounts, good luck, we need more csm members that is willing to look at the game from a different perspective"
5/8/2010,"yes, it is. and it's not wrong to begin with. employment history just shows who you worked for, paid or unpaid, nobody cares."
5/8/2010,"at the risk of annoying potential voters for me, i feel i must correct this misunderstanding you have that csm can be classed as employees of ccp.6. did the ""employee"" of ccp sign an employment contract or receive regular pay cheques?answer: no, csm delegates only sign a non-disclosure agreement and no payments were made. i'm not sure about icelandic law, but over here if you haven't signed an employment contract then the only other way you can be classed as being employed by a company is if you have accepted regular payments from that company.7. have you seen the nda which the csm are obliged to sign when they take up the role which specifically states they are not employees of ccp?answer: apparently not then again i have only seen the contact from csm4 which may be different to those issued for earlier csm.whilst at the csm summit ccp supplied food, lodging and paid for flights and transfers. however they also (afaik) did the same for the journalist from pc gamer magazine who was writing an article about the csm. are you trying to imply that he must have also been classed as an employee of ccp? i certainly wouldn't put my time on csm4 under the employment history section of my cv, but it would be totally relevant under the ""other skills"" section."
5/8/2010,"obviously what ive stated before hasnt been read or understood;employment is a contract between two parties, one being the employer and the other being the employee. an employee may be defined as: ""a person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, where the employer has the power or right to control and direct the employee in the material details of how the work is to be performed."" black's law dictionary page 471 (5th ed. 1979).so point 6 is irrelevant and so is point 7 - and tbh all this is political desperation in trying to smear someone that is only volunteering her time to help pass players comments and concerns to ccp is getting tiresome,i can understand rl politicians conducting a constant smear campaign as they get paid untold fortunes in costs and guarrenteed future income etc but not game players - all the potential csm's are trying to do is make a differance."
5/8/2010,"which jurisdiction is that definition taken from because as i stated where i am from you are not classed as an employee unless you have either a) signed an employment contract or b) have been accepting regular payment for work done.i have no axe to grind with ankh, i am stating that the idea that csm can be classed as employees of ccp simply for accepting a volunteer role is ludicrous. in addition if it were treated as employment then it would be classed as a second job and thus my tax rate would go up i am simply stating that as far as my jurisdiction is concerned it is not classed as employment.as to a smear campaign, i dislike it in rl politics and i dislike it here. i haven't stated an opinion on ankh's use of her csm volenteer work as part of her employment history, i have just stated that it is not employment in the strict sense of the term where i am from.i would state how i was involved in a player elected council debating issues and producing minutes. those are the types of transferable skills that many employers look for. and lastly iirc the nda contained a clause that we waive any claim to being employees of ccp"
5/8/2010,"the fact that you don't get why people are doing this just shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the issue at hand. read all of her quotes and campaign messages without the 'fanboi' rose-tinted glasses you appear to be sporting and you will see that she has made it her mission to try to negatively change the preferred play-style for a lot of people. if you still don't get it, then you really are playing the wrong game."
5/8/2010,if i was playing the wrong game then i would have discovered that approx 6 years ago
5/8/2010,now you're getting somewhere. it is verymuch possible to play eve for 6 years and still don't have a clue what it's about.ofc you need to be a bit dim for that but statisticly you really aren't a special case :)

5/8/2010,"in order for this to get serious consideration, you would have to make a substantial case that it would be helpful, not just to your corp, but to many other corps as well. it is not enough for csm to say ""this is a cool idea"", in order to get something done, it has to be able to argue ""this is one of the best possible uses of dev-time"".in your case, you are having a marketing problem. in order for me to bring this up (assuming i get on csm), you would have to persuasively argue that:* this is a problem affecting a significant population of the users.* there are no decent out-of-game solutions.* of the universe of in-game solutions, this one maximizes (users_helped * usefulness) / implementation_difficulty.of course, all of the above means i probably won't get your votes. but on the other hand, if i told you want you wanted to hear, i wouldn't deserve your votes!"
5/8/2010,"what lowsecs realy need, is to boost... no-no not boost, complitely revising... or even, will dare to say that, finaly give a birth to piracy in eve.atm there is millions of ways in eve for go griefing, but almost none for actual piracy.no hostage capturing, no ships capturing. ransom works poorly (mostly in didnt work at all).and ofcourse there is another side of lowsec problem - to few targets, as smart guys (and gals) wouldnt come to lowsec for carebearing unless he/she also do there both pve and pvp (even then, it is mostly better to pveing in highsecs for betetr income, and the go to lowces for pvping atm).lowsecs does not give as much profit as it give more risk. you need fit differently in lowsecs, which is already slowdown alot of you isk making. it require more of your time to lower risk of been caught (as often using directs can, aligning almost constantly for instawarp, and so on) , which is as well slow down your effective isk/time ratting. and of course it requere to sit alot in docks, if you are already been picked as a target.there is ofcourse now a way to go on missioning in unscanable fit, but it'll again requere to sacrefice alot of your dps (and as so your effective isk/time), and you still can be caught at gate (exclude of using not named here exploit).in return it give ou a bit (its realy very low boost) more lps per missions. it have prety much dead exploration (exclude searching for wh, so its wh exploration anyway). and low profit mining.as a fact, even many 0.0 player have an alts who doing mission in highsecs for making money for pvp (although dominion gives good boost to 0.0 pve, yet i can tell you how to do more money in highsec on missions, then in 0.0 on anomalies), simply because its both easier and more profitable (provide you know where exactly and how to make good money in highsec).and, as a fact lowsecs ""pirates"" are one of the poorest guys in eve. yeah-yeah i know, some times it comes to an jackpot for few billions worth loot, alot of adrenaline and short time hapiness, but let not fool ourself, average isk/time for pirates (who not also doing some pveing) are very low. none can claim (unless he/she is a liar) that he/she venture on weekend from home 0.0 to nearby lowsecs, spend few hours by pirating, and gain by it enough isk to pass next week in usual 0.0 pvp... unless its always a very cheap fited drakes of course = ))"

5/8/2010,"i was asked, that do i think about current state of capital ships. do i think faction capitals is a good idea? does insurance is needed for the capitals? so, i will answer those here.i do not have anything against faction capitals. but i won't hurry ccp to implement those either. yes, they would make interesting addition and good money sink, but i think, for the start we need t2 capital mods. it's long past, since capitals and capital modules were introduced. many of us have perfect capital skills. it's time to introduce something new. yes, some new pilots would whine, that this widens gap between old players and new players, but this could be said about any new t2 stuff introduced in the game. it's natural state of the game. live with it.as for the insurance, i think it should be entirely removed from the game. capitals are no special case. yes, losing capital will cost more, but that's fine. capitals are meant to be costly."

5/9/2010,"for a laugh, i'm gunna open this up again.tagami, a flat damage boost to rails just won't work. you are right though, failguns need something, but that something has to be new, different and exciting.goum, you are also right, but wrong at the same time. the dps from rails appears to be good when coupled with ehp but railguns are still ""failguns"". they need a boost.so how would we boost them. well, i've been thinking about what someone said ealier in this post but i'm sorry i'm not gonna search through this threadnaught to find your post. the suggestion was to look at how railguns were thought to have been originally designed. with the ability to penetrate shields/armour. this is a very interesting concept which appears to be very difficult to balance because the big question is ""how do you decide how the penetration attribute works without giving you the situation of the targets tank being unfairly ignored?"".well, i think i may have the answer, although a little complicated.first, penetration will be a chance based system. the chance to penetrate will be based on the current state of the targets shield/armour (maybe even both). example: target has 100% shield. there is a 0% chance of penetration into armour.target has 50% shield. there is a 50% chance of penetration into armour. target has 87% armour. there is a 13% chance of penetration into structure. etc etcsecond, how much damage will spill over into the next level of defence? well i had the idea of a ratio dependent on the targets fit. a simple example would be this: target is shield tanked. target has 500hp in shield capacity and 100hp in armour capacity. the ratio between the two is 5:1. damage would be spread between shield and armour in that ratio. so result would be if attacker scored 12 points of damage the damage to the target would = 10 damage to shield : 2 damage to armour.now we could go even deeper into this mechanic and spread the damage across all three. which to be honest, we would have to as a ships shield is almost never = 0%suppose the attacker has been successful at penetrating a targets shields and has caused damage to armour. the target has 50% shield, 85% armour and 100% structure. we could use an accumulative probability of penetrating both shield and armour and causing some damage to structure.so, attacker has a 50% chance of penetrating the shield and a 15% chance of penetrating the armour but this a cumulative probability so... the chance of penetrating the armour = 0.5 x 0.15 = 0.075.if the attacker gets very lucky and penetrates both shield and armour, the damage will still be spread across the in a ratio. so a shield tanker with 500 hp shield capacity, 100 hp armour capacity and 100 hp structure capacity would damage distribution would be 5:1:1would this mechanic work?"
5/9/2010,"no, for a variety of reasons. the most obvious would be that it wouldn't fix rails in the situations everyone's *****ing about them sucking... the next most obvious would be that they would become what the **** overpowered in other situations.imo, a flat damage boost is what both rails and hybrids need.-liang"
5/9/2010,"flat damage bonus will only put us in a situation where weapons are becoming homogenised. yes i agree that most of the arguments in this thread are based around fleet combat. well i mean large fleet combat where i believe there is a larger problem with game play than a weapon system that doesn't offer the same volley damage as other weapons for just a little bit more range. which appears to be the whine. ie.. ""my failgun only does x amount of dps where as everyone else can do x+y dps at the range we all engage at, boo hoo fix it please by making my failgun like a laser but with kinetic and thermal damage pretty please""i've made a proposal that would make railguns unique. railguns can still be easily countered through their complete lack of tracking, their cap dependence and their pathetic dps. being able to cause damage to the vulnerable parts of ships with small amounts of dps won't make them super overpowered. remember that they are still dealing the same dps only with this mechanic they would have the chance to spread that volley across the targets ehp. yes there would need to be very in depth testing and probably slight adjustments made to a failguns damage. this mechanic also takes into account a targets preferred tank and most of the damage from the volley would be applied to that part of the ships ehp if the attacker got lucky.example:ferox fires a volley with a rack of 200mm fails and volleys for 750 damage. say the target is a prophecy. an armour tanked bc of the same class. an example buffered fit has 4274 hp in shield 13275 hp in armour and 5494 hp in structure (not ehp). lets forget resists for now.lets say that the ferox scores 3 perfect volleys in a row of 750 dmg eachvolley 1 hits the prophecy's shields only as its shields are at 100% and there is 0% chance of penetratingvolley 2 hits. prophecy's shields are at approx 82%. there is an 18% chance, less than 1 in 5, that the volley will penetrate. for poops and giggles sake lets say the ferox gets lucky. now then the ratio of s:a:st = 1:3:0(approx) because st is ignored when armour = 100%because the prophecy is an armour tank, for every 1 dmg point caused to shield in the volley, 3 will be applied to armour. to a total of the volley.lets apply that.180 damage to shield and 570 damage to armour.volley 3 hits. shields = 78% (22% chance to penetrate) armour = 96% (chance to penetrate = 0.22 x 0.04 = .0088 less than 1%) but lets say the ferox gets lucky, again . out of the 750 volley; 150 hits shields, 450 hits armour and 150 hits structure although very unlikely.as you can see its going to take a long time before the prophecy's shields are so low that he can expect to always hit armour and have a good chance of scoring structure hits before armour = 0. also, you can see that most of the damage is applied to the prophecy's primary tank, armour, and not structure. you can also see just how lucky the ferox pilot needs to get to hit structure before shields and armour are low.does this not make rails a much more interesting weapon system that has a certain 'niche' thats not just tickling your target at extreme range?by the way, if my maths is really off or something can you point it out. i don't care if you make me look like a maths biff.edit: bad england"
5/9/2010,"you say that like its some sort of curse word - and furthermore you use it ignorantly. even with a fairly substantial damage boost, the weapons would have extremely different flavors.no, you made a proposal that makes them overpowered.lol? do you have any idea what you're talking about here? worst case scenario - nobody in eve has them trained. 3 months, everyone has them trained. i think we can all agree that effective dps is all that matters - and railguns that bypass resisted layers are extremely overpowered.more than just ehp, you can completely bypass their tank. you say 3:2:1 or some ratio (eventually), but the reality would be 3:25:5 - which would cascade to a 3:10 pretty damn fast. i completely agree that active tanks need nerfed more. -liang"
5/9/2010,"(1) explain the extreme differences between beams and rails if they do similar damage. i must be missing something.(2) can you fire a railgun with no capacitor?(3) i never said that they would bypass resisted layers. i said lets ignore resists, and i meant just for that post. resists would still apply to damage dealt.(4) the ratio would always be the same as its based on shield/armour/structure capacity not actual. i'm sure i mentioned that too but i'm sorry if i didn't"
5/9/2010,"sure...beams do em/thm damage to kin/thm from hybridsbeams have more dps than hybridsbeams have much larger volley than hybridsbeams have less range than hybridsbeams require crystals instead of individual ammo like hybridsbeams are problematic to reload when you've broken a crystal, unlike hybridsbeams are are actually heavy on the capacitorbeams take 1 second to reloadbeams have contracting issues if you use faction/t2 crystalsyep, sure sounds like exactly the same ****ing weapons system to me.some hybrid using wimp complaining about capacitor usage makes me laugh - really.you misunderstand - if your damage is ""bleeding through"", then you are bypassing that resist layer.you contradict yourself?-liang"
5/9/2010,"beams and rails have fixed damage typesbeams do more dps/volley than rails but if the proposal of a flat damage boost goes through they will deal very similar amounts of damage.beams have less range than hybrids but the damage proposal also proposes a range reduction to spike.hybrids require capacitor to fire. not as much as beams but they still need it.crystals are the only major difference but that's what gives beams a 'quirk'.please liang, be adult and don't use profanity. i'll admit the weapon systems are different but the differences are not major.on point (2) making a personal attack is unnecessary. i use all weapon systems so i know the problems with cap on lasers. however hybrids suffer similar problems, not as extensive, but its still a problem.on point (3) damage would bleed through but most of the damage would be applied to the ""tank"". as i said the damage dealt ratio is shield capacity : armour capacity: struture capacity which leads us into point(4) which is the probability to penetrate not the amount of damage bleed through as this is fixed."
5/9/2010,"assuming the 15% damage proposal goes through, i suppose that:- 8% less dps (369 vs 401)- 50% less volley (1900 vs 2800)- crystals vs ammo- significantly higher capacitor usage- less rangei haven't seen said proposal seriously considered.tbh, what you're doing is ignoring many differences and trivializing the ones that remain. on the scale that things in eve are different, hybrids and lasers (even with the proposed 15% damage boost) would be very different. i mean, unless you want to complain that ""omg, it does damage therefore its exactly the same oh noes!"".one sentence above you just got finished talking about how there are major differences that even you admit are major. i stand by what i said - hybrids use capacitor. lasers mother ****ing guzzle it.bam. the underlined part is unacceptable and ridiculously overpowered.which is still unacceptable.-liang"
5/9/2010,"for further proof that this is utter madness, lets take a myrmidon, fit something as follows:myrmidon<irrelevant>2x med cap booster, <irrelevant>3x centum a-type mar, 3x cormack's eanm2x aux nano pump ii, nanobot accel istrong exilefor reference, it tanks well over 2k dps.4883 / 4542 / 5371 hp layoutlet's suppose for a moment that 2 rail hypes (~1400 dps) are shooting this thing, and fast forward to the point where the shields are gone...0 / 4542 [21339] / 5371 [5371] hphype 1 fires for 775.32 real damage making for a 17% probability that the second hype bleeds through almost 60% of its damage into hull. even though the myrm can tank the hypes trivially, it will die in short order because you are 100% bypassing its tank.-lianged: thank you for your valuable suggestion to nerf active tanking. it really really needs it. it also breaks for a (large) variety of other reasons."

5/9/2010,"first of all, i do fly a covops and i still think it's ridiculous that someone can sit in a system 23 hours a day. having a red in system puts people on edge, especially when you know there's nothing you can do about it. go live in 0.0 for a while if you don't know what i'm talking about.second, i already suggested very high skill requirements for probing down cloakers. it's the second sentence in the first paragraph. maybe people should read more than the title of a thread before posting.third, ccp could make it so you only get a 100% signal on stationary targets. probers would not be affected as long as they're smart enough to align to something before they cloak up."
5/9/2010,"what will happen then is people will sit with a prober 300km off a gate, sees a transport ship jump in, it spots the gang, cloaks, prober pops scan with probes already in place and warps to the hit... just an unintended side effect i can think of.trying to suggest any sort of movement defeats this would take special coding, as well as insure that all afk cloakers simply set a speed, completely defeating your idea.there are plenty of already in-game alternatives to dealing with this issue that we dont need to waste devtime with adding useless content like this."
5/9/2010,"isn't the point of cov-ops to go behind enemy lines and make them feel a bit on edge and gather intel? seems to be working as it should imo.i read about the training requirements, i just stated what i though the requirements should be. was it over the top? sure. but then again, it is a bit over the top to suggest being able to train something that will totally destroy the workings of several classes of ships. what would the downside be to being able to probe them down? i know how easily my sb can be popped if caught in the open. thats part of the trade off i take to have a cloaky ship.your third point make no sence at all. whats to keep someone from just flying towards empty space, cloaking up and going afk?the thing is, your suggestion does nothing about afk cloakers. all it looks like to me is a cloak nerf. the only suggestions i have seen that make sence to fix this ""issue"" is removing local or making an auto logout. im not even sure the auto log out is a good idea.btw, when was the last time an afk cloaker hurt anyone? i find it funny that people are so scared of someone not at keyboard popping their ship. i just think that some people have been caught off guard by a cloaky ship and popped. but thats what those ships are for."
5/9/2010,this does not encourage co-operative play. it encourages people to hop on cloaker ships solo and pick off their targets. there is absolutely no risk to cloaking in a system full of hostiles and choosing what targets you wish to engage and when you wish to engage. it allows for pure consensual pvp where the cloaker has 100% control of the situation. don't like the odds? don't uncloak and engage. odds in your favor? go for the kill. a miner in the same system cannot mitigate the non-consensual pvp that a cloaker brings to the table. the most a miner can do is park a blob next to him to discourage a cloaker from engaging. that's it. but it's still the cloaker's choice on how things go down.
5/9/2010,"i feel that the present mechanics behind starbase batteries are broken. how it works (confirmed with testing) is that each gun gauges its tracking and ranges using the starbase tower as the origin instead of the battery itself. while this does prevent pilots from orbiting a given battery at 0 in order to out-track it and empty it while taking no damage, it both severely hampers some short-range turrets (especially blasters) and negates the usefulness of tactical placement. it is also confusing as the batteries will display the battery-target distance when being manned while the accuracy is actually being calculated using the tower-target distance instead.i propose that the batteries use themselves as the range and tracking origin, increasing the importance of tactical placement and increasing their effective firing coverage area. as it is, blasters are incapable of achieving optimal-range status on targets except in very rare circumstances (a large blaster on a small tower). autocannons and pulse lasers get saved somewhat by range bonuses on their racial towers, but blasters suffer the most due to the lack of such a bonus.proof - four small blasters placed adjacently at a small tower at the top. one small secure can placed approximately 10km up from the blasters (approx 15km from forcefield), and a second can placed 5km from the bottom of the tower forcefield. the can at the top received less than half of the hits that the bottom one did. furthermore, training one blaster on another blaster produced a relatively high rate of misses, something that should not happen if the batteries calculated range from themselves instead of the tower. just to drive the point home even further, i trained the blasters on the tower itself and achieved a 100% hit rate despite being 20km from the tower."

5/9/2010,"counter-proposal: concord stop rescuing people for free. it's unrealistic as hell (amirite?) and it is hugely unfair that the player merc corps should have their livelihoods wrecked by unfair npc competition. how could miners make a living if npcs gave a million units of free minerals to anyone who asked? that's how unfair it is.i propose that people should have to buy their protection from concord like everything else. if you dont pay, they wont lift a finger to help. fees should be roughly equivalent to what player mercs charge, with corp and alliance contracts available. 100 mill a week for an individual, or 500m for a corp or 2.5 bill for an alliance sounds about right - perhaps someone from repo or noir could comment here?of course, there would be no obvious way to tell if someone was protected or not, but what the hey, sometimes you have to take risks, and hugely increasing the costs and penalties of playstyles we dont like are what whinethreads in the assembly are all about right...?"

5/9/2010,"first off, i thought you were suppose to post a ""nurf tracking disruptor's"" thread... second, no to this.breaking the lock is not so bad but, the cycle time is too short if your in a larger ship. it would be even more annoying then the current situation. there are ships out there that take longer then 5 seconds to lock. those ships would have 2 chances to fail at avoiding the jam. they most likely would end up jammed the entire fight.with smaller ships it would be a pta. jammed, relock, attack, jammed, relock attack, jammed.... small ships will always have their locks broken. i am also confused as to why a small ship would ever fit eccm. eccm does not work on small ships. (forgive the math. it is probably not right. i do not have all the information needed to get everything correct atm and am at work so can't just ask someone in game for the correct info. it should be close enough to prove the point.)an ares has a base magnetometric sensor strength of 10 points. a mag eccm ii fitting in the mid slot would boost that to 19.6.a falcon (l5 recon skill) using a t2 mag jammer would have a jam strength of 19.44 just with the falcons jamming bonus. so your looking at something along the lines of a 96% chance (with eccm) that the falcon will break the ares lock nearly every time. your screwed with or without eccm. it can only get worse.as mentioned above this post there is another issue. this change completely removes the need to ever fit eccm. a sensor booster would always be better since it helps you relock after a jam, before you can get jammed again, and it helps you lock faster in every situation. eccm would merely reduce the number of times you get jammed... if someone is bothering to jam you. no jamemrs on the field, eccm is a wasted slot. kinda like it is now.before you can adjust ecm you need to fix eccm. why can i rig a ship to counter damps but there is no rig to counter ecm?why is eccm the only electronic warfare counter that provides no benefit in fitting unless your being someone is using ecm against you?one thing that would help everyone in the debate is an active ""jamming failed"" indicator. adding a sound that means someone failed to jam you would be good. anything that would tell the person who is being targeted that a jam attempt was made. right know all you have is the negative. i can know how may times my eccm failed but never when it succeeds. if a falcon puts takes 5 attempts to get a jam on me i am happy. he is not able to jam a lot of my gang mates now but, all i see is that i am jammed, again."

5/9/2010,"around 1-2 years ago now, not one but two changes, to t1 frigates mostly, have increased the use of rifters, merlins, punishers etc. i dont think anyone would say this is a bad thing, personally im with the opinion that the more ships as alternatives are available the more interesting it gets - both for choosing and fighting them.there are however still a large number of ships that are hardly used, if ever, and that for years now. i find this quite surprising, because this is one thing that seems easy to fix if compared to planetary interaction or wormholes - but for me atleast has the same potential in adding game content.lets start with the whole tier system, which in some shiplcasses is still intact and just obsoletes several ships at once. an extreme example would be the small barge, but there are also the breacher, tier1 haulers etc.without going into details, if one has the choice between either a good or a bad hauler, or between a fast hauler, a tankier or roomy one - what do you think will keep more players interested..also important imo is balancing ships from a pvp viewpoint without making them ineffective at their current roles or pve roles. take the heron as example, its used by players for exploration, but a new player fitting a 220 cpu combat probelauncher on it with a point and ab/mwd is impossible. if the ship however gets boosted to a point where it is still far behind the buzzard, but has its use as a scout and prober more new players can get into probing in pvp, which to me is a great part in eve.theres plenty ships in eve that can do with an overhaul, new and longtime players will benefit greatly from it - just look at how many players enjoy the 4-5 worthwhile t1 frigs."

5/9/2010,"i support b). such a thing is trivial when it comes to implementing, and should be an option for the corp to set for their towers.if you value giving priority to little fixes like this, vote for cinori aluben. my priority is that ccp make these ""little things"" a priority. as such small items wouldn't require heavy coding time, devoting dev time to them is solely a matter of prioritization, which the csm will have an active part in now.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
5/9/2010,"b) and 2nd part of c)b)will let director who is not involved with pos refueling to disable mails.c) management window will let you check pos status then you need it without flying to it. sometimes it is required, especially if pos does not have static setup? and you can not say for sure how many days loaded fuel will last.supported."

5/9/2010,"look, assembly hall ( at least i thought) was meant to be serious. serious suggestions and comments to possibly improve the game.recently, at least that i have noticed, a few noobs have been spamming assembly hall. i'm not talking about occasional bad ideas, like remove wardecs. but the obvious idiots that post on assembly hall.assembly hall usually has 1 troll post on the first page, its stupid and somthing needs to be done."
5/9/2010,not supported
5/9/2010,"not supported, also i think you're trolling."
5/9/2010,"two choices. 1) flame them into oblivion, 2) don't feed the trolls, and instead let the threads die. #1, is more satisfying, but #2 is the only one with a decent chance of working."
5/9/2010,"supported in concept but not in op's implementation.assembly hall needs to be limited to characters/players that actually care about whats going on in eve, not just for lolposts and terrible trolling like caod."
5/9/2010,"thisis what im getting at, and love how musical troll doesn't support now emo obvious troll should also not support"
5/9/2010,"trolls are people too, hate speech against trollism is classed as discrimination and could get you banned. i would advise against this bigotry especially on a forum with great diversity."
5/9/2010,"no, you can't be a person and a troll you are one of the other"
5/9/2010,"not sure if srs...in any case, this is almost a non issue. trolling in assembly hall, when compared to the other forums, is pretty rare. not to mention you yourself may be attempting a cunning meta-troll with this thread. not supported, sorry"
5/9/2010,"your sentiments are shared with a-many in the csm world my friend. supported. this, and additionally, a friend suggested having ""csm-blogs"", where csm members could write blogs that would be approved by ccp for official publishing on the eve-o site. along the lines of previous comments here, these blogs could be oriented to changes that were initiated by csm interaction, and on the progress csm is making. while it's true that each member could have their own blog that they update without the 'approval' of every word from ccp, they would not get as much read from the playerbase as an official blog on ccp's site.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
5/9/2010,"the amount of questions going through the ingame help channel means many questions and just as likely answers aren't being seen in time before they disappear out of the window which is pretty much always expanding.i propose the creation of multiple help channels based on categories, probably numbering eight or less, the names of which i'll walk away from so as to gain more support for the general idea rather than the detail which the csm electorate can hash out when or if it gets to the icelandic meeting."
5/9/2010,"if this is technically feasible, i'd like to see it happen. however, i suspect that it's not. i do support raising it to ccp just in case it's doable, but frankly, you shouldn't expect much."
5/9/2010,"supported.while this is technically infeasible now, since ccp has no way of telling via itemid whether something's a bpo or not, there's an ""easy"" solution.have a bpc and a bpo be a different type of object, ie, two itemids. that way we can have our inventories (shock, horror) actually color bpo's and bpc's differently.and we can have killmails act sanely."
5/9/2010,"anything that will make it easier to manage blueprints is ace in my book!!!please, whoever gets voted in, push this to the top of the 'we want this fixed now' que... right above destroyer utility."
5/9/2010,"it is the same issue of differentiating them in the hangar. so it will require a major overhaul of the database and all the parts of eve that rely on the database. practically it will require redoing one of the founding structures of the game.so doing it for the killmails or the ease of industrialists is not worth it (especially as industrialists have some workaround). it would be a good idea for ccp to do that as part of a huge modernization of the game, but it would be part of a very big patch aimed only at rewriting legacy code."
5/9/2010,"i really cant see why it wouldnt be technically possible. look if there is a max runs remaining, if that is the case add copy behind blueprint."
5/9/2010,totally supported
5/9/2010,100% supported.
5/9/2010,"now, for clarification, this only applies to howitzers and artillery (and repeating artillery). autocannons are awesome with that sick ""hail of bullets"" look. before i begin, here is a (sad) diagram to help explain the parts:turret...projectile effect...target...|................|...................|...x o --------------------- o x......|..............................|...firing.......................impact...effect.......................effectwhat i feel that is lacking are the impact effects of both artillery (standard and repeating) and howitzers and the projectile effects of howitzers. especially with the higher-damage rounds and the larger guns, the impact effects should ideally be more like a missile explosion. what is being fired is a large shell that should explode on impact. the explosions should not be nearly as big those of missiles, but large enough to convey the impression that it is doing some serious damage.also, the projectile effects of the howitzers used to be, and still should be, what is essentially a rocket-propelled shell, complete with glowing rocket trail, that hurdled across space rapidly before hitting its target. this further conveys a general aura of awesomeness as multiple howitzer shells rocket at high speed toward a target before exploding.edit: diagram updated for lack of sucking."
5/9/2010,"i'm not sure what kind of problem the session timer is meant to be working around, but there has to be a better way around it than just putting 30 seconds on transactions such as 'changing ships in the hanger'.apply some of your incredible programming talent to actually fixing whatever the problem is, rather than just saying 'it takes 30 seconds to enter and leave ships for no reason. also to join a fleet. also anything else we randomly decide fits the criteria for triggering a session timer.'"
5/9/2010,"yup, you bet.drop it.though the first time you cyno a super carrier into oblivion, i don't want to hear a peep out of you about reimbursement."
5/9/2010,"a quote from the evelopedia - 'the data interface is never destroyed in a job, and is spit back out as soon as the invention job is installed, thus only one is needed, even if you want to run multiple invention jobs at the same time.'now data cores and decryptors are at least used up. how can you realistically make enough isk from interfaces and the items from which they are produced if almost all interfaces are never destroyed?not enough inventors from new players will join to buy them coupled with the fact that some veteran inventors stop inventing. how many inventors create their own indestructible interfaces? i know i did."
5/9/2010,"a more accessible logserver would be nice, when i was first asked to use it by a gm the process seemed over complicated and that made me unwilling to do it.one possibility is be able to enable the log server from the escape menu. a check box like ""start log server on next client start"" with a field next to it to decide where to save it to, or a button to open the folder it was saved in.ccp help us help you hel... ahh you get the point i hope."
5/9/2010,so you've played for 6 years and still fail to see how her proposed changes would negatively impact the game? wow... just wow.
5/9/2010,could you please confirm this last point regarding claims of employment by ccp from former csm members being a breach of nda. i find this very interesting.
5/9/2010,white knighting wont get you any mkay ?
5/9/2010,"at first i thought ankh was bad, but then i got a lobotomy and suddenly she seems to have good ideas."
5/9/2010,"great movie, got my vote! truly represents the players instead of personal agenda, and has nice track record."
5/9/2010,have you actually read any of her opinions? like.. a single one of them?
5/9/2010,"i don't think the stuff posted about her is true. it comes from her direct competitors and if you read her track record documents, they do not show strong bias towards a carebear agenda. i see 0.0, pvp and fw issues amongst them. that proves that the accusations are false. i think ankh can seperate her personal views and her csm role. that and i want someone that knows how fw works on the csm. her fw issues prove that she knows what she's talking about."
5/9/2010,"eve-search doesn't lie. hell, you have screenshots of her ""evil egg throwers need to get banned"" crap in local."
5/9/2010,"be rational. ankh has been on the csm twice. she hasn't raised any issues to ban pvp or people that gank. the suicide gank issue she raised is balanced. it asks for pvp means to deal with it, all pve means have this listed as 'con'."
5/9/2010,"just a reminder that my blob issues focus group is scheduled for 15:00 eve time today. yesterday, focus groups on low sec and ecm balance were conducted. both sessions were excellent, with in-depth discussion about real and perceived problems, potential solutions, and in the case of the low sec discussion, an exciting proposal idea. the proposal idea fits exactly with my vision for how low sec should be addressed. suffice to say that it involves boosters. within a couple of days, i will have the discussions summarized and make the raw audio available (because participants said they do not object to that). the draft of our proposal is in the works; as soon as the focus group participants have had a chance to vet it, one of us will publish it on assembly hall. watch this thread -- i'll post when stuff is published. also would like to thank the following folks (among others) for endorsing me for csm on their blogs: nashh kadavr, larz smith, myhrial arkenath, ahnog, yriellevandis, aiden mourn, cirocke, and flashfresh."

5/9/2010,what is your personal opinion of the following:pirates/piracyscammers/scammingsuicide gankers/gankinghow would that impact your judgment on the csm?
5/9/2010,"they all have a legitimate place in eve. the 'verse is a harsh place. i think pirating is key to life in eve. it should however be a balanced challenge for the agressors and the targets. if its unbalanced you either won't have pirates because it isn't a rewarding experience or you won't have pirates because there are no targets. pirates have to remain part of the risk/reward that eve offers.scamming is also a part of eve. however there have been some bad game mechanics that made some of it too easy, for example the complexities for the contract system cost folks some isks. but again, eve is harsh so i think scamming is a part of the experience. if i can talk someone into giving me a ton of isk to get get into the goons and it turns out to be a scam, well welcome to eve!suicide ganking is also a part of eve. i want it to again be ""balanced"". we've seen some steps in the right direction with adjustments of insurance. suicide ganking should never be a simple isk source with no downside. i wouldn't mind seeing ""self destruct"" produce a little more extreme effect around the folks in the vicinity though. so how this impacts my judgement? i respect the value of those aspects of eve. although i am more inclined myself to do things folks might describe as 'carebear-ish"" i would never want eve to be made ""child safe"" and ""tamperproof"". eve has to remain a place with a clear progression of risks and rewards. the best risks are those that players themselves can create and expose other players too.i hope that helps you pick a csm candidate to support!issler dainzeexcited about this exciting csm election!"
5/9/2010,"with regards to suicide ganking, are you familiar with the risks that already confront the ganker? as someone who ganks on occasion, i can tell you that it is not as simple or risk-free a process as many make it out to be."

5/9/2010,"i agree with everything you said, so i'm voting for you. my biggest issue with eve at the moment is people being too scared to fight, and having too many ways to avoid it. i want more risk, and more violence. warp to zero, and standings in local chat made it possible to completely avoid a fight. delayed local in low-sec (maybe 1 minute), and wormhole style local in 0.0 (invisible 'til you talk) would put the danger back into it.i've been playing eve for 5 years, and i have more isk and ships than i know what to do with, and all i want to do when i log in is pvp. i don't care about taking a loss, i just want to fight everyone."
5/9/2010,"there is actually a few killboards i have come across when scouts and logistics are listed separately on the operation, i'm not sure how this is implemented though."
5/9/2010,"yes! i agree so much. almost all the fights that are had nowadays are people who were intending to go out to fight in the first place. sources of income are increasingly distanced from ""non-consentual pvp"", and ganking people in belts gets harder and harder. i know a lot of people won't like what i say and that i ""only want free kills"".... well, yes. yes i do. if people are rarely dying, then there is not much risk involved and all you're doing is just farming isk. there should be enough income there to make it worthwhile after the deaths, since you can't force people to live in the belts against their will, but there should still be real risk to being there.link? i think you could only do that if you manually edited the people in, or maybe fit 1 gun on the logi so it appears on some km"
5/9/2010,"ultimately, csm is an intel gathering tool for ccp. a way for them to get a good handle on the issues/improvements players are most interested in. overall, i think it's an excellent idea, and one page i would like to see other mmo's take out of ccp's book.i don't expect a whole lot more from csm candidates other than to be active players, read the proposals in ah, and to bring those issues before ccp. they aren't ccp employees, they're players who represent the playerbase.i'm glad you're having fun mazzilliu. it is only a game after all, something which some candidates, *cough* ankhesentapemkah *cough*, seem to have forgotten."
5/9/2010,"exactly. when they take you to iceland they are going to keep you at their office for about 8 hours each day... there actually isn't much time to see the sights over there, and when ccp's time with you is up, they'll still pay for your return flight but if you want to stay longer you have to pay the rest of your way.the only problem csm candidates i've seen / heard of are the ones who are really dumb and keep bringing up issues that don't take into account other people's play styles, or just don't work well with other people. when you get to iceland, there is a lot more that goes on other than simply raising the issues. the link someone brought up earlier gives you an idea about how things are likely to be next iceland summit as well. here it is again-"
5/9/2010,"max skilled warrior iis (which, is, by the way, about 3-4m sp compared to drones 5 + the ew skill to 4 + electronic drone operation i) spit out a bit less then 100 dps. max skilled hobgoblin iis spit out somewhere in the region of 130-ish dps (don't have eft on atm). which is about 10%-15% the dps of a bs (taking 1k dps as base, which can - naturally - be exceeded). also, a bs will often have things like heavy neutralizers, points, rr and so on and so forth which also get inactivated. they're also far cheaper. that definitely does not seem ""on par""while i'm more or less ok with how ecm works (read: i don't like it, but w/e, i doubt it'll change, although it is much more powerful then other ew), the cheap, disposable and trivial to skill into ecm drones truly are out of whack with t2 damage drones. the lights in particular need a nerf - not the ""make them useless"" type of nerf, but they are a bit too good as things are and could use with reducing their effectiveness by 20-30%.the major problem of other ew drones is that no effect is as powerful as ecm is, and given dronebay is very limited (so no spares on most ships at all), the contest between situationally useful stuff vs always useful stuff can only end in one way. second major problem is the fact that the effects of them are stacking penalized leading to very low overall effectiveness.you got gcc for repping pirates for the last two years afaik, definitely way pre-qr, therefore i guess it's a feature by now."
5/9/2010,"you and almost every other candidate are running on a platform that consists largely of trying to get ccp to adjust/rebalance/fix existing content; i think this is in line with the desires of the playerbase for ccp to focus on such issues for at least one expansion. ccp's preference is to introduce significant new content with each expansion; they reportedly feel that this is important to continue bringing in new subscribers. that being the case, in order to persuade ccp to devote more resources to balance issues/existing content, you're going to have to make the case that doing so would be good for their bottom line, for example by reducing the rate at which existing subscribers burn out on the game. do you agree? if not, why? if you do, what qualifies you to make and present such a case?(i'm loosely paraphrasing anklsadsfsfsgf here, but it's one thing i think she has right)"
5/9/2010,"i must say i've been very impressed with your thoughtful responses, elise.you can count my vote."
5/9/2010,lowsec carebears reporting in!
5/9/2010,"i definitely agree, and it is something i've touched on before, that ccp is a business above all else. the introduction of the csm was even a business decision. with that said, i have a fair amount of experience in the corporate world and have a firm understanding of how businesses think; heck i can even throw around the buzz-words with the best of them. i do believe that i can make a good case for a content-fix patch. while i do not have access to the raw data, i think it is safe to say that there are a huge number of unsubscribed players right now. no marketing resources are required to draw these players in, obviously, and if they see that ccp is inclined to keep them happy they will invariably hang around for longer."

5/9/2010,"do you think this makes you look any smarter as a csm candidate, sokratesz? still on your very personal crusade versus ankh?i know, why i will not vote for you, sokratesz.no serious csm should behave and act like you do. if you don't agree with ankh, that's fine. but your childish behaviour discredits you.no vote for 22 year old punk-kids, who answer a customer's question with a solid ""noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"" in a thread on this very official forum here and who smacktalk on the boards to those users, who have requests, questions, inquiries etc., just because they promote different opions and suggestions than you do. epic fail on that, dude."
5/9/2010,"no serious csm should behave and act like ankh does, either. if anything, ankh is more annoying because of the ""i'm a serious candidate which wants a more balanced eve for everyone and am not anti-pvp"" in her csm thread, while there are heaploads of ""pvp-ers are antisocial bastards and need to get rl therapy"" statements which you can find on eve-search and she spews such garbage in local. if she honestly said ""i'm the carebear candidate"", well, ok, i guess carebears want representation too. what is not fine is the utter dishonesty in pretending to be anything else but a carebear candidate."
5/9/2010,"give or take, she's as dishonest as the pvp-csms (and most of the csm are only catering towards pvp and piracy, because it is what they do and what they want eve to look like), who are then talking about some mission running tweaks... ahhh that's so duplicitous.at least she is trying to balance eve, other csms including sokratesz are only advocating for one side of the game and would like to kill all carebearing at once, because they lack targets in their lowsec space.edit:it is really oustanding, that you feeled the urge to make a thread about her, just to mock on her... wow, just wow. do you think you are any better than her? in fact, she fights for soemthing and you... well, you only try to flame and mock someone here. now, you've opened the thread, now live with people who do not agree in this very thread with your opinion and your attitude towards her."
5/9/2010,"pvp csms don't try to hide the fact pvp is what the're interested in. she is trying to hide the fact she's a carebear candidate. that is the problem.while there are csms of the ""i want to boost lowsec by spawning a carebear in officer fitted golem in every lowsec belt"" variety, they're preety obvious. a carebear can easily see they are pro-pvp, nerf carebearing candidates and go vote for someone who has their best interests at heart.ankh is in no way trying to balance the game, and her level of knowledge about pvp mechanics is the same as my knowledge about level 4 missions, since i've never ever ran one (unless ganking lowsec mission runner counts).that said, lowsec is largely fine, and if it wasn't for the blight of fw turning a good sized portion of it into horrible bloblands it'd be lovely."
5/9/2010,"i totally agree.oh and branko:i see a lot of pvp-csms trying to hide the fact , that they only want to abuser their candidature to erase all carebearing from the game.her pvp knowledge is pretty solid, much more solid and profund than the industry,trading,mission running knowledge of all the pirate- and griefing-csms is.and my question remains: why did you even start this thread? whats the purpose of it? to mock on someone who you don't agree with? man, you are cheap."
5/9/2010,"you're saying zero is somehow greater then zero. that does not work out very well.because of the ""i'm not anti-pvp, blah blah"" crap in her csm thread trying to suggest she is not, in fact, a carebear candidate. calling someone out on a lie is more informational then mocking."
5/9/2010,woohoo look what unsolicited spam arrives into my inbox:
5/9/2010,"it does. ankh's pvp knowledge is greater than the so called ""knowledge"" of carebear issues of the pvp-csms. and on top of that: ankh is trying to balance the eve gaming experience for everyone not only for one group of players as opposed to the gazillion of pvp-csms out there.it is my firm belief, that there are mor ""peacefull"" and empire-enjoying players around than pvp players, since those pirates allways cry for targets and more targets and more targets and to nerf carebearing and to nerf it and to nerf it some more. the lack of targets gets to them, ruins their day, if they can't ruin someone else's day.because of that, i am pretty sure that ankh will get enough votes. she stands up for *all* of the eve population, not only a small fraction of pirating scumbags, who only look to ruin someone else eve expeirence by suicid ganking etc.in what regard is that different from what other csm cadidates are doing? they call the few industrial and carebear csms liars, they spit on them, because they don't agree with them. they pretend to argue for all of the players, but hell... if some cvarebear is going to suggest something, they are flamed by those very same csms on the boards for asking something, that is not in favor of pvp.your thread is fail and what you are trying to achieve is easy to see through. guess what? your attempt backfired."
5/9/2010,"you don't have to alt-post to repeat lies (ankh has pvp knowledge, ankh stands up for all of eve population, pirating scumbags only look to ruin someone else eve experience by suicide ganking), you know.there is no problem with people voting for a carebear candidate. however, the ""stands up for all of the eve population"" is laughable."
5/9/2010,"sorry to bust your bubble, but a) i am not an alt of her, you might want to check ingame andb) she does indeed try to sort it out for everyone, not only for some players like the majority of the other candidates. i never ever heard something of substance regarding an improvement of the empire game aspects from the so called pvp-advocates.in fact, you prove my point: you are scare of losing your gank-targets, when the game improves for empire players. that's why you started this thread. you do not want a reasonable voice in the csm programm taking care for carebears and pvp players.."

5/10/2010,"so if cc dont like the idea of a t1 bs doing more than 1200 dps , they could always make it easier for gallente to reach than other races. one of our biggest problems is we have to be a glass cannon to get the little dps advantage (on paper) over other races. so let say they change our damage mods so we get the same dps from 2 damage mods as we get from 3 now .(thats one lows slot saved for extra plate , resis , nano w/e) and adjust the penalty so that stacking 3 is like stacking 4 now so unless your not planning on taking any damage there is no real point stacking a third damage mod over a plate/resis. just an idea"

5/10/2010,"well let's see. a ferox can probably go 1387 m/s with 3 overdrive ii, and a dc ii in the lows while fitting 6 heavy neutron ii and a lol standard launcher ii. a cyclone can outrun it at ~1750 m/s with the same low slot fitting. ok, lets look at the armor tankers. the king of the blaster boats the brutix is the slowest of the bunch at 982 m/s that is with thermal, kinetic, and explosive hardener ii's, a dc ii, and 3 medium trimark ii's. oh, and you have to fit a rcu in the last low since you can't fit 7 heavy neutron ii's and a y-t8 mwd. the prophecy barely breaks 1000 m/s with thermal, kinetic, explosive hardener ii's, two eanm ii's, an anp ii, and 3 medium trimark ii's. (btw i'm trying to keep this all tier i so all you 'apples and oranges' guys can shut up.) everyone got the same mid-slot fittings with y-t8 mwd, web, and scram. the ferox, and cyclone got 2 invulnerability ii's, with em ii, thermal ii, and cdfe ii rigs. the brutix added a cap recharger ii, while the prophecy had no spare mid-slot to fit anything else. of course the prophecy tops them all with ~74k ehp, then surprisingly the ferox with ~54k, brutix with ~52k, and cyclone with ~42k. the ferox is able to dictate the engagement with it's speed, and can run in and blast away, run out and recharge a bit of it's shields and run back in again. the only tier one bc able to do that better is the cyclone."
5/10/2010,"this is a very valid observation, but ultimately shows that the biggest problems with blasters isn't their raw damage output. it's their ability to apply that damage effectively. this is why we see shield tanked brutixes and hypes - because they actually have a prayer of getting into range to deal some damage. so i think that if you don't increase blaster damage agility and speed, then you must *dramatically* increase their raw damage output (and maybe tracking).and to whoever above said that blasters aren't a caldari weapon... i laugh at you good sir!-liang"
5/10/2010,"speaking from personal preference as long time battleship user, i'd say a 20% raw dps increase for blaster will make me want to fly megathrons again, even tho i'll still hate how hard it is to fit one.likewise, if blaster damage was increased 10%, i may try mega and hyperion once, but would stick to my preferred dominix and typhoon. ability to fit heavy energy neutralizer >> extra dps."
5/10/2010,"i was wondering how long it would take for you to notice this hole in my idea. i was thinking about this earlier. it punishes active tanking as active tankers rely on heavy resists and rep amount rather than a buffer. so i thought, if the ratio of damage bleed included an effective hp vs the thermal and kinetic damage profile instead of just basic hp, would this help push the damage distribution ratio back towards hitting the targets tank rather than its structure?"
5/10/2010,"about 15 seconds after it was suggested, actually. i even referenced it specifically in post 714 (my second on this topic).no. any weapon that does bleed through as you described it is ridiculously overpowered... full stop.-liang"

5/10/2010,"liang, you're right the suggestion in its crude form is overpowered but this is why we post these things, to be critised, to refine the idea. i've changed a couple of things like adding a modifier to the ammount of damage caused.i have another way of doing this but i need to work it all out again to see which is better. i haven't looked at the effect on an armour buffer, or active tanks yet though i am trying to find a solution to that problem if it still exists.here is what i've worked on for you to peruse over.......formula 1 *even damage spread accross the ratio with damage modifier*effect on shield buffer tankferox rail buffer fit vs drake ham fit with mwd16157 : 4883 : 4883 3 : 1(0.5) : 1(0.25)450 : 75 : 37.547.25+63 : 17.6+24 : 15effect on ship: 1st volley of 750 (shield only as shield = 100%) 750=375+375. apply resists volley=375(0.21)+375(0.28) =78.75+105 =183.75shield=16157-183.75 =15973.25 or 99%2nd volley of 750 (has 1% chance to penetrate shields and 0% chance to penetrate armour)volley sucessfully penetrates shields so...3 : 1(0.5) : 0(0.5) damage distribution562.5 : 187.5 : 0apply modifier and resists135 : 52 : 0shield=15973.25-135 =15838 or 98%armour=4883-52 =4831 or 99%3rd volley of 750 has 2% chance to penetrate shields and 0.02% chance to penetrate armour but only if shield penetration is successfulllets say the ferox pilot is the luckiest pilot in the world and not only has scored 3 perfect volleys in a row has also scored 3 penetration rolls in a row.so...damage distribution ratio would be (damage modifiers are there too)3 : 1(0.5) : 1(0.25)450 : 150(0.5) : 150(0.25)450 : 75 : 37.5apply resists110 : 41.6 : 15shield =15838-110 =15728 or 97%armour =4831-41.6 =4789.4 or 98%structure=4883-15 =4868 or 99.7%or if no penetration mechanic for comparison2250 damage to drakes shieldapply resists236.25+315 = 551.25effect on shield:16157-551.25 = 15605.75 or 96.6%i've traded 0.4% shield damage for a slim chance to score 2% armour and 0.3% structure damage. i don't think this is game breaking. also the chance to penetrate a layer doesn't get probable until below 40% said layers capacity. and then not likely until below say 25%.so in 3 volleys in 8.4 seconds with a total of 2250 damage before modifiers and resists. the ferox has caused 3% shield damage, 2% armour damage and 0.3% structure damage.the drake has managed to get 2 volleys off in this period and is using kineticvolley=1654 (perfect hit to be fair)after resists volley=463.12 so 2 volleys = 926.24 damage to ferox's shieldsferox shield=9854-926.24 =8927.76 or 90.6%ferox is not omgwtfbbq overpowered pwning the drake. however as this is a chance based system a practical test (over and over again) would be required to prove balance.i'll look into active tanks later but i'd like your feedback on this before i consider posting in the stupid ideas and useless suggestions forum.please don't just say ""no, its rubbish and belongs in that crazy forum"". please i'd like some real constructive feedback from you cause i know you are good at that."
5/10/2010,"honestly, one of the biggest fixes would be to simply redistribute base resists. npcs have different resists, but all player ships are homogeneous in that em is always the weakness of shields and explosive is always the weakness of armor."
5/10/2010,"imo, that's exactly where it belongs - because the mere suggestion is crazy talk. however, using this latest round of explanation, it looks like buffer shield tanks are the best case scenario.... and quite possibly the only scenario it ""works"" in (if killing the shield tank with up to half armor left is ""working""). armor buffer tanks tend to fold with 20-40% armor left, and active tanking as a whole is massively nerfed.furthermore, i don't think there's any way to fix these problem areas, because they're intrinsic to the idea of penetrating someone's tank. i mean, unless you stop suggesting real penetration at all... in which case you should just sign on to the bandwagon of fixing current game mechanics instead of introducing new ones. afterall, 1 point of bleed through isn't ""new"" or ""exciting"" or ""different"".... merely something useless that someone will justify for keeping rails less useful than they really should be.-liang"
5/10/2010,"spugg, it an interesting idea. i kinda like the premise. but it would need some (ie alot of) work to prevent it from being overpowered. either a reduction in the percentage chance, or (and this would be ironic) a reduction in rail dps.in any case, keep at it. would certainly make rails unique and drastically change how people fit and fight. perhaps bulkhead reinforcement would be the new ""in"" thing."
5/10/2010,"it's pretty much not possible to balance something that penetrates tanks like this suggests. it's an altogether harder problem than balancing dots - which have themselves tend to go from ""meh, totally ****ing useless"" to ""what the **** omg ridiculous blizzard fix this right ****ing now what the **** bbq!"" in incredibly tiny spaces.it's simply intrinsic to the idea of damage penetration that you will be ignoring some percentage of someone's primary tank or you can't possibly justify the reduced damage... and as long as that's true, you'll end up with several types of tanking that are pretty much totally marginalized. i think the game will have gone downhill in a pretty massive way if we are all hull tanking because there's no other good tanks out there.really...... the idea of tank penetration isn't feasible for a lot of reasons. but... keep brainstorming by all means.-liang"
5/10/2010,supported because no other race has a damage type specific bonus. this cripples caldari for pvp. if they were 100% free to chose damage type would balance the already not pvp effective missile boats.

5/10/2010,"current situation: fleets can use broadcasts to share information in a compact form, ranging from ""shoot this guy"" to ""warp to that planet"" to ""oh crap, i need reps"". these are awesome tools, and they work pretty well. however, watching the broadcast history window has one severe drawback. it's a real pain to actually pick out the targets that have been called and actually make use of that info. in order to target the person who the broadcast is about, you have to right-click the broadcast, and select lock target. proposed change: at minimum, ctrl-click should target lock the subject of the broadcast - the person calling for reps on a rr broadcast, or the item being targeted on a kill broadcast. ideally, have the right-click menu treat the broadcast as if it were the topic of the broadcsast - i.e., you could get a target broadcast, right-click target, right-click orbit, and then work with it as a target without ever having to pick it out of a cluttered overview. obviously, the overview will still work better - it won't scroll as fast, for example - but working out of broadcast history will be an option. of note - this would only apply to broadcasts about a target. position-based broadcasts(need backup, broadcast location, etc.) work this way as-is. benefits: the simple version will make logistics pilots click about a billion fewer times in big combats. the complex version will also improve everyone's ability to coordinate fleets, and improved ease of use for everyone, as well as making it slightly easier to be a new-to-pvp pilot in a big fight. drawbacks: the only thing i can think of is that it's possible that this will cause some extra lag for some weird reason. the ctrl-click version certainly won't, but i'm not sure about the right-click menu version."

5/10/2010,"blueprint management is a mess, whether its distinguishing between originals and copies, lockdown votes for 100s of bpos at a time, or hoping that new guy who wants to build ammo doesnt cancel your chimera build. i think its time to take a second look at how players interact with blueprints.i propose a library system, where blueprints are essentially given their own distinct hangars.it would look something like thisin this example, there are seven blueprint libraries that can have their roles controlled independently like corp hangars can today. players can choose to interact with blueprints through the library or s&i tab, but they can also add specific blueprints to their quickbar, so they dont have to wade through the morass of rig bpos to find the couple they find the most profitable. additionally, lock and unlock votes can be initiated for an entire library, greatly streamlining the security process.each library is divided into four sections. two of these store the actual blueprints: one for originals, and one for copies. never the two shall meet except when in the cargohold of a ship. this negates the need for any fancy-schmancy db overhaul to solve a major organizational headache, as the game can still treat bpos and bpcs as the same object, and only needs to look closer at them when they are being manipulated. the third section is for jobs launched by blueprints in that library. if a character does not have permission to access a library, they will not be able to affect its associated jobs.tasks: fleet finder for industrialistsin the tasks tab, players can create a formal to-do list, specifying blueprints that need research, copying, or manufacturing in the future. within a corporation, the ability to do this is defined by an additional role. however, any player with access to the library will be able to initiate a job from that task, provided the necessary materials are on hand.all tasks need three things specified: the blueprint to be used, the type of job to be done, and the number of runs performed. specifying a location (without a specific slot) is optional (in the case of invention, mandatory) as is specifying the input/output hangars.additionally, to make this more useful to individual players, a shopping list can be automatically compiled from the tasks list. it can either be setup to buy all materials off market minus that in a specified hangar, or to include materials that will be produced from other tasks in the list (for instance, capital ship components when building a cap ship)some additional features can be looked at for inclusion in this task system. it might be possible for someone setting a task to freeze the blueprint until the specified task is completed, disallowing any other jobs to be done on it. additionally, tasks may be set to repeat, if, for instance, there was a blueprint that should be in non-stop copying.perhaps more controversially, when executing a task, the game might not check the role of the player executing it, but the player who set it up. thus, a corp member need not have access to the hangar with all the materials can still build that marauder, as the person who set up the task and specified the input/output hangars did have access.in summation, this system would greatly improve ease of use, security, and productivity, as well as providing a base that can be expanded upon in the future if/when the need arises."

5/10/2010,"i'm very sorry but what you are proposing is beyond silly.i have macro express installed on my machine. i have been using macro express for many years now. what you are saying is that because this software could be used for macro mining that i would have to choose to either stop using a piece of software that i have paid for and used for many years or continue to use this software and not be allowed to play eve.another major flaw in your plan.. you do realise that you can create a macro to macro mine using nothing but microsoft word?if anybody has any programming language (visual studio for example) installed will you ban them as well from playing eve?i can appreciated that it is very hard to distinguish between a macro miner and somebody who is just mining afk. when i mine i am afk for most of the time and if you sat there and watched me you would probably suspect i was a macro miner, but i'm not. i imagine that can be said for many other people.however what your suggesting is just plain silly. i'm very sorry."
5/10/2010,"kara - i wouldn't call it silly as all i'm trying to pass along here is what someone else did to solve the problem, you just don't agree with a possible fix and you are very much entitled to that opinion. furthermore, if you read thru additional posts, probably something i've tried to emphasis here is targeting the macro programs that are made commercially available specifically for the purpose of eve-macro playing, not the the commonly used business applications. also it would stand bear additional reading as you would notice that i've already said that people who have programming skills can beat an application like this, maybe you have the requisite skill sets but really you assume that everyone does and that is very much not the case."
5/10/2010,"it makes no difference whether the majority of people have the skills are not, you only need 1 person who has that skill and its game over because they will just release the information on the web.if any thing you could make the situation worse as if you limit macro mining to those few they will just money out of it. i know i would.either way, once the information is out there, its out there.i understand targeting applications that have been written for the sole purpose of macro playing eve, but that still leaves the 100's of other applications that you haven't targeted. you have to target all of them otherwise it is a waste of time and resources because will just use those applications that you haven't targeted.the only real way to discourage macro mining is to make more of a risk going afk, more rats, more often and more powerful, but because of the way the game is designed, i.e high sec belts having no rats, this is not an option.i apologise to you for calling it silly, that was out of line and remiss of me. i hope you accept my apologises as they are sincere. if anything you should be congratulated for at least trying to come up with a solution."
5/10/2010,"i like the idea of combating macromining, but instead of taking an offensive measure against everyone's comp how about taking a proper defensive measure in the software, i would propose something along the lines that has been used for 5 years now to keep bots away on many a website picture test, many forms could be used from requiring to type a word from a picture to being directed to press a certain button, real easy as the pop up has already in the software it just needs to be modified for when you target and are about to mine an asteroid, it would create a pop-up that says something like you are about to mine an asteroid please type code xxxx (in picture and something that can't be easily read by a machine, but desernable by the human eye or have it come up with like 3 buttons and ask to press the right one ""please press the square"". to many failures could alert concord or something like that. my thoughts is if your too incapable of pressing the right button or a simple type this you probably shouldn't be playing this game."
5/10/2010,"in my exp over the past 1 1/2 years doing invention, i have made 70% - 80% profit margin continually. that's covering my cost and 70-80% more. some things to consider in t2 production, #1 who can use what your making is it a mainstream item or is this a small market item that requires tons of skill points ? this is going to effect how much you sell and in the end your profit margin as items that don't sell fast get flooded on the market and there prices drop horribly.#2 knowing your market and where to sell, if you sell your stuff in jita you better be a volume seller as the profit margins in that area are the sux. #3 i think the biggest mistake people make here is they train up the relevant skills with out doing any research for the demand of a product or where to sell it to maximize profit and when they get the news flash that its already a flooded item on the market with nearly no profit margin they get angry. you should watch the market in the region you want to sell pick the item in question figure out the costs involved and how much you will make and then research how much dose the sell price fluctuate in a 2-3 month period generally you need to create a excel spread sheet to properly calculate this complex equation. invention is not for everyone some people are more suited to role of miner its alot simpler. in the end i think this has little to do with bpo and more to do with supply and demand and the lack of research of those getting into invention and item creation."

5/10/2010,"i'm not sure if it's come through well enough what i've been meaning to say. the ecm should have a less efficiency than it has now. so as you won't find yourself constantly jammed. being a chance based module, this may happen once every cycle for a period of time being chance based, but you may also never get a jam off, even on a frig.the cycle time is simply to allow it to hit more targets, as the consequence is less when jammed. if you're up against a single target, i would personally prefer losing lock 5 times in 10 sec than being unable to do anything at all.the correct number on a falcon is more about 11 with just the falcon skill, with upgrades and rigs however, you can push 14 points. so if you take the scenario of a 14 point ecm and a 19 point eccm on the ares, the correct answer is a 73% jam chance with 1 racial jammer. this is indeed very often. compared to an eccm'd bs the number is 32.5% chance in the case of a domi (cause i love them). all this is high. but if you half the effect of the jam module with the mentioned effect (or whatever seems appropriate) it's honestly not bad.the eccm module is indeed a bit useless atm. it can be used for two things atm. making yourself unprobable, or reducing the chance of getting jammed. this without no actual positive effect on the ship (like a sebo has). this module should indeed be looked into. i've kinda semi-suggested above that the sebo and eccm could be thrown together in a single module and be scripted. this would mean the cycle time needed to be very long tho, so as to not allow ""instascripting"". something like 30-60 seconds.i very much like the idea of an indicator for the jam. this could be usefull for all the ewar mods tbh. as is you only get the ewar module on the ov if successful, same with the small time-bar on your hud. i'd like another effect like a sound indeed."
5/10/2010,"decreased effectiveness in successfully jamming did not come across, at least to me, in the original post.if i am jammed i know i am out of the action for 20 seconds. i can use that time to gather intel on the fight. check my scanner, look for new targets on the field, make calls on numb nutz that do stupid things (both friendly as well as enemy). i would rather do that then be constantly spamming to lock targets because my lock is being broken.i wont quote the other paragraphs but responding in order.math, bleagh!!! i don't have a good idea on what to do about eccm's gimpyness. combining sensor boosters and eccm does not work since sb reduce lock times and extend lock ranges. you would end up with a 3rd script or have to drop one of the current scripts. making the sb decrease lock time and put range and better vs jamming scripts on eccm has logic on it's side. then again there is not a single fit i use where increasing lock range though the eccm fitting would be of use to me. it's not like i am gonna give up a tracking disruptor on my arbi to fit the ""new"" eccm even though it is the one ship i would find it useful on.the fail indicator is a really good idea. just came up with it while thinking about your post. it would provide validation that your commitment to using eccm is paying off... or not. i might have to make a separate proposal just for that idea."
5/10/2010,"doing missions as a none caldari i find it unfair that i cant change my damage type, caldari already have the best tanking ships out and best docking games ships too with shield rechargeable too.i think with scripts we can change damage type, take angels for example, lazers do bad damage on them but as caldari i can just change my missiles add some painters and do max damage.here are some ideas.lazers script - your em / thermal damage will do 100% more damage to structures and 50% more damage to shield, however your tracking is reduced by 50% and your total armor hitpoints reduced by 25%missiles script - you now deal 50% more damage to targets within 30% of your optimal range (capped at 30km) of you, however your capacitor will be reduced by 50%hybrid script - your hits will set off a smartbomb like effect which do 50% of the actual damage dealt however ew modules will have a 50% reduced range and cost 100% more cap to activateprojectile script - 50% of your projectile damage will pierce through shield ignoring it and doing armor damage only (if armor is @ 0 hull will not be affected), however your optimal range is reduced by 50% and you no longer benefit from propulsion modules eg mwdthis wont be changing the damage but it makes things a little interesting"
5/10/2010,worst proposal in a long timethink of the big picture this would affect a lot more than your carebear world. two pointers1. eve is not fair a all learn to live with it.2. cross train to caldari.
5/10/2010,no
5/10/2010,"please make sure your monthly downtime is in the aussie timezone's prime play time, we already get the daily downtime to wash the dishes and clean the kitchen after dinner. having an extra 12 hours during our prime time would mean we could get the house painted, the roof fixed and the car serviced as well."
5/10/2010,"wow dude, just for this i am not voting for cat."
5/10/2010,this.
5/10/2010,both the rapier and the huginn have a useless bonus (tp bonus). replace the tp bonus with a 5% web strength bonus per level.
5/10/2010,"minmatar recons are fine, quit whining."
5/10/2010,web + tp + minmatar recon + 5 torp launcher phoon = winnot supported.
5/10/2010,"tp bonus is far from useless, it's just people don't know when or how to use it"
5/10/2010,"this.but, the panther should get torps then to pair with the rapier."
5/10/2010,learn to play the game and stop whining.
5/10/2010,"first, let's agree that the interesting bonuses of the recons are the bonuses that don't come from the t1 hull. as such, the lach/arazu is only interesting because of the scram bonus and the pilgrim/curse because of the neut bonus, etc. in this light, the rapier is a total failure. the truth of the matter is that if the painter bonus means so much to you, you're almost certainly better off bringing a vigil or bellicose. the vigil even boasts better survivability.simply put: the huginn and rapier were too crushed by the nano nerf. but then, i'm sure we could get the same crowd as above to tell us that the arazu is already overpowered because of its scram range bonus.-lianged: in case it wasn't obvious, i'd rather have functional, usable bonuses on all my ships. bonuses that are usually ignored (rep bonuses on the brutix, damp bonuses on the arazu, etc) are a strong sign that something is drastically wrong. fortunately, we aren't quite to the point that people are like ""lolwebswhywouldufitthat?"" but we aren't terribly far off if a bunch of major forum personalities are raving about a painter bonus."
5/10/2010,"if the heavy (assault) missile bonus was changed to a web strength bonus, the huginn would be a happy ship. web+tp and ships die in a dramatic fashion."
5/10/2010,you don't use tds on your curse?
5/10/2010,"the neut bonus is far and away the more interesting bonus. tds aren't totally useless (neither are rsds for that matter) - but if all you were interested in was tding you'd probably be in an arbitrator. even still, the td is a much better damage mitigator than webs with the ever decreasing amount of blasters and increasing turret range (pretty much everyone else can still reach you through web range).-liang"
5/10/2010,"there is nothing weak about having 40+km 60% webs. the ""omfg i hit a brick wall"" effect is gone for everyone. as for arazu taking its role, well, idk, the last few arazu pilots tackling me ended up with a 150+m wreck because 18km range is not so awesome. fortunately so few arazu pilots fit damps ever so they're quite easy to kill.sure, the ships got nerfed with the nano-nerf, but honestly a ton of ships got hit preety hard in the nano-nerf and the rapier (and huginn if you don't need the cloak) is still reasonably often seen and a fundamentally useful recon.it's not a murdering machine like the curse (which is, btw, still far from unkillable, also it does not sport a covops cloak like the rapier), but it's still a very useful recon."
5/10/2010,"the reason that arazu pilots don't fit damps is because they almost certainly won't keep you out of lock range. you can reasonably expect to be locked at 15-20km even if they aren't sporting a sensor booster or have a high natural lock range (recons). really, damps are worth fitting maybe 10% of the time, and 90% of the time the massive ehp/tank liability will get you killed. small wonder nobody fits them. also, faction scrams are nice... and actually worthwhile as opposed to webs outside fed navy.comments:- first, those 40km webs aren't as useful when you can't tackle someone at that range. anything over 24-28km is kinda ""yay!"" but really pretty meh.- 60% webs are less of a speed hit than a scram/neut - which makes the arazu and curse flat better at ""brick walling"" someone that relies on speed in any real sense.- all these nano ships have pretty awesome range these days - which makes 40km webs look a little meh. either they warp away or you're close enough that they're going to tear you a new *******.anyway... i have no intention of flying rapiers when i have arazus and curses at my fingertips.-liang"
5/10/2010,you make it sound that the rapier is only flown solo. how about arazu points the ship and rapier holds it within range of the arazu?just a thought.
5/10/2010,"proposal: active eccm module decreases jam cycle time to zero or so (if jam was successful - u simply lose lock on target), instead of increasing sensor strength.why:eccm modules takes 1 med slot, but gives almost nothing: even if u are a recon with eccm (like 60 sensor points) u can still be jammed by 5 small ecm drones (sic), and even for few jam cycles in succession.and 20 seconds of jam is pretty enough to take overwhelming advantage over your target, whatever it is.result:1) u still can escape from the enemy using ecm drones or dualbox falcon, but u dont have guarantees of easy kill more. 2) jam will still counter logistics and rr battleships (but u cannot ""disable"" eccmed logistics with just a bunch of small ecm drones more)3) more variety in cruiser-sized and bc ships fitting: necessity of a choice between eccm and web (now choice is obvious, because eccm is totally useless for this ships)(ps: i have made many tests before posting this, and also i am experienced solo/small gang pvper, so please abstain from posts like ""whine more, n00b"")(editing in progress)"
5/10/2010,not supported ..ecm has gone from ..guaranteed jam to chance base.the falcon from 200km+ to 70kmusing your example....the arazu has a sensor strength of 26. with a singlt eccm iiit rises to 50.96.a falcon with t2 fit has a jamming strength of between 11-13 for each racial.this give you less than 25%ecm has been nerfed enough.
5/10/2010,boost eccm!counter-proposal - eccm should half the effects of any ewar on you if it's some % effect like td/painter/web/dampener and make on/off effects like ecm and scrambler fail 50% of the time
5/10/2010,"some things you need to include for it to be workable:what reason is there to use more than one eccm?- no other counter has the power to completely eliminate its opposed ewar.what happens to eccm arrays (low-slots)?- less time reduction? if so then why not make it a general reduction in jammed-time and forego the lock-breaking?how will the ecm boats survive against fast lockers (frigs, sebo cruisers etc.) if they fit eccm?- without a huge decrease in ecm cycle time the level of twitch clicking to get away from an interceptor will be insane, so ecm needs to be included in ""fix"".as you can probably see there is no 'easy' way to solve the issue without a major rethink of the whole she-bang, once that is the case we might as well start reimagining the whole ewar concept to give meaning to damps and tps as well ... he mentions ecm drones jamming the eccm toting recon which they do regularly .. they are very, very broken.as for the ""nerfed enough"" .. define nerf? so far all the changes, except the one that made it chance based, have worked towards balancing ecm when compared to alternatives .. ""less range+more power+more offence"", ""less strength+more bonuses"".i think that even the most hard-core ecm lovers saw the problem with having 150-200km jamming so not really a 'nerf'."
5/10/2010,"ecm is fine as it is. i might want a couple tweaks around the margins - ecm drones need a slight nerf, for example - but the core mechanics work well as it is. don't change them."
5/10/2010,ecm drones have already a really low jamming strength.... how do you want to nerf them more?
5/10/2010,+1 need nerf ecm & hate ecm drones
5/10/2010,"in practice, it's not that low. i've run tests of identical ship fits fighting each other on sisi, one with ecm drones, one with dps. the ecm fit wins a big majority of the time on ships with no drone bonus, even before you consider that ecm breaks scrams and dps drones don't. i consider an ecm drone nerf to be much less important than a web/td/damp/paint drone buff, but it's at least something sane to propose."
5/10/2010,"an ecm drone nerf would really be unnecessary if the other drones were boosted. furthermore, i would argue that dedicated ecm ships have been nerfed enough. i have two very good ecm pilots and neither one has been in an ecm ship since the nerf. just bring moar deeps.... makes the battlefield seem very two dimensional (deeps vs eehps!)-liang"
5/10/2010,"if they're going to garuntee faction mods, you will very soon find all your favorite hunting spots camped 23/7 by people who will delight in taking your faction mods as well as the one dropped by the ships.sorry, i don't think i can support this."
5/10/2010,can't support this.not even when asked in chinese or korean.
5/10/2010,"you havent done much 0.0 ratting have you? lol faction spawns dont spawn in one place all the time lol..people are not going to be waiting for you lol thats just a ridiculous notion...and wholly supporting my idea...if you dont support then at least come up with good tangible reasons for it, because i will fully scrutinise you on it."
5/10/2010,"you havent done much 0.0 ratting have you? lolif every faction spawn dropped mods, the mods would be a fraction of their current value and you wouldn't be as excited when you see one. it is a roll of the dice. mostly, you'll get ammo, but there is a chance you can make big bank. that's what gets people all excited."
5/10/2010,"fine point however my concern is that the drop rate seems to be getting worse i would say out of 10 faction rats i have had only 1 has dropped something and it was still not much..if your talking about market prices fine, make faction spawns more spawnable and then keep the drop low. you cant have it both ways. it defeats the purpose of finding a faction spawn, why make it rare if at the end theres naff all in it.."
5/10/2010,"faction mods are expensive (partly because they are nice) but mostly because they are rarely dropped from rarely spawned npcs. if you want every faction rat dropping a mod, but maintain the same drop rate, you'll end up almost no one ever seeing a faction spawn. i have heard the likelihood of getting a drop goes down as you get further from the time the server booted up. i'm not sure the validity of that, but i think all the faction loot i've found was not too long after the server booted up."
5/10/2010,dont touch them ... you will have several side effects on the market. faction mods will get cheaper -> everyone will fit them -> regular t2 mods no one wants them anymore etc.no no everything fine with it.
5/10/2010,the commanderinchief seems to have changed his mind. locking this thread now as it no longer has any content.
5/10/2010,hmm lemme think about this you want me and many others like me to bring our expencive hulks and orcas into 0.0 for what exactly ?.if its to mine well pretty much i can mine everything i need either in high sec or in wh's and the risks are marginal even in a wh compared to oh i dont know having a carrier or two dropped on me for fun .nahh you want us in 0.0 then start giving us t2 and t3 ships and capital ships untill then have fun in empty space we will be thinking about you while hiding in empire space :p.
5/10/2010,"so what you're saying is that you don't like racial outposts, and want them all to be the same?"
5/10/2010,100% support
5/10/2010,"mails should be sent at 24h, 12h, 6h, 3h, and 1h, or something like that. also, they should show fuel in the towers with times, as well as just quantities. api monitoring is nice and all, but the in-game tools should be up to snuff too. imo, all three of op's proposals are good changes."

5/10/2010,i am curious what rock you have lived under and what ankhhblablabla actually paid you to write the above sentence when her statements and public message is the exact opposite to rational thought and logic.
5/10/2010,"your suggestion that you work for a rich, elitist gaming company is offensive to the actual rich elitist gaming companies of the world."
5/10/2010,"so since apparently everyone has been living under a rock according to you, which attempts did she make during her time in the csm to ban pvp?"
5/10/2010,"the suicide gank issue was only balanced because csm1 would only support it if she changed her original, over the top proposal to something more balanced. her original proposal would've essentially made it impossible for suicide ganking to exist.so the issue isnt balanced because of her - its balanced because of the other csm members (in csm1).it's fine if you want to vote for ank - people have different ideas about the game and just because i dont agree with them does not make them inherently invalid. but do make sure you're informed properly."
5/10/2010,"inappropriate content removed.applebabethe issue document as stands has not been changed in any shape or form. none of the other csm contributed to it in any way, it is balanced because *i* made it balanced, the rest of the csm had no part in it. and i always wanted suicide ganking to remain a possibility, it should just have harsher consequences, which all csm agreed with (and ccp agreed with too, or else concord would not have had the buffs it had, eh?). and the fun thing is, that i didn't request concord to be buffed, i asked for tradeable killrights, overhauling the bounty system, booting gankers from npc corps, and more ways to prevent known criminals hiding behind concord.remember my very first campaign video? i'm saying ""we need more consequences for these scumbags!"", not ""we need to make suicide ganking impossible!""i thought you were a honest candidate, but seeing you fling mud and sprout false accusations here and on tweakers really changed my opinion of you."
5/10/2010,"it is impossible to inform myself properly with all the disinformation in this topic. many accusations have been made against ankh, and when i look into them, half of them are clearly false, and the other half are dubious at best. when i look at ankhs campaign message, her videos and her explanations, i do not see a whiny carebear, i see an intelligent, highly motivated woman that participates in these elections due to an inner drive to contribute to the eve community. i see someone willing to represent me, and does not hesistate to voice criticism to ccp when their policies and decissions are not in the interest of the players. i see a strong personality that goes against all odds. i greatly respect ankh for being willing to keep up with it, despite the negativity thrown at her. ankh just said your claim about the proposal is false. do you have anything to back up your claim?"
5/10/2010,"ha ha, listening to a politician's propaganda."
5/10/2010,i'd believe that sooner than the rambling of other politicians flinging mud in a campaign thread that isn't their own.
5/10/2010,if you had any sense you wouldn't listen to either.
5/10/2010,"well i verified the chatlogs of that meeting, and it turns out the issue itself wasnt adjusted by the csm as i originally thought (it was over 2 years ago), so i apologise for that. however, what did happen was during the discussion with ccp when we talked about this issue, that ank did suggest some measures that would make it very difficult or impractical (almost immediate concord response, much harder sec status hits, etc). other csm members did argue against such harsh measures. this was done as part of the discussion with ccp. eventually we reached an agreement on slightly improving the sec status hit (on the short term). i guess i got the meetings mixed up in my memories :p"
5/10/2010,"and where did i say everyone in my response to stevakis, hm? i hear with a bit of social engineering, you can make anyone* believe pretty much anything.*) as there is no patch for human stupidity."
5/10/2010,"i find that very hard to believe, because the meeting minutes mention nothing of this, and because the meeting minutes make it sound as if ccp already had made up their mind (that being that the ganking was too much in favor of the aggressor and needed fixing) before the meeting. i also find this hard to believe, because ankh just posted details that contradict your accusations, and your other accusation have just turned out to be false. that and if you look at ankh's first video and her posts from earlier elections, you don't see her calling for concord buffs, but for player-driven means of dealing with criminal players. sorry. i believe ankh's story here."

5/10/2010,"well, this only proves one thing, you are completely incapable of arguing with anyone, or in thinking through other opinions and being rational about them. ccp market this game as a harsh and dark game of pvp where you are never, ever safe(even if docked thanks to your friendly neighbourhood scammers), and this person appears to be completely against pvp in general unless its ""a certain type"". i will continue ganking people thank you very much, as will my friends, we are literally gankers in arms, and get to plan roams the next day whilst doing rl stuff"

5/10/2010,"the meetings took two days. the minutes are what, 20 pages or so? condensation, and loss of side debates, are virtually inevitable. funny, because some are literal truth, and most are at least reasonable. you are in a large alliance, talking about how you're an independent candidate. you did admit to alt-bumping your csm1 thread. you do have ccp as an employer on your cv. you do primarily play solo, and eve is an mmo. whether those are meaningful, or good reasons to vote against you, is a matter of opinion. but they are simple facts, and hardly lies."

5/10/2010,"no, we don't, we let people make up their own minds, and at least i'm not ordering my supporters to bump my thread with useless replies :)"
5/10/2010,"all i can say about suicide ganking is from the ""person being 'sploded"" side of the experience. i know a lot of my corp mates avoid a variety of systems with their hulks because of the high number of folks that seem to be suiciding their hulks. as i said, i think it needs to remain a part of eve. that said it needs to be properly balanced as any action of risk/reward is. the insurance adjustments looks to be on target to tweak that balance.so my official position on suicide ganking:1. valid part of eve2. should be balanced like any risk/reward experience in eve is.3. /me hopes i don't get 'sploded again but if i do, well just another day in space! :-)issler dainzetrying not to be suicide ganked but if i am i know its just the sort of thing you can expect to face if you undock"
5/10/2010,"yeah tbh most people who gank hulks just do so for ****s and giggles--nerfing that would be hard. hauler ganking on the other hand one runs the risk of the loot popping or another player swiping it before your hauler arrives (something which has happened to me multiple times). so while i agree that nerfing insurance may be a good idea, it seems that suicide ganking is not on the whole terribly unbalanced.one last question: iirc you said some very harsh things about pirates in the wake of larkonisgate. do you stand by those?"
5/10/2010,"i am really glad you brought this up. i was not critical of pirates. i was critical of lark who was just a really bad pirate in the context of the scandal. a really good pirate would not have been so obvious and would have made a fortune.what i thought was the biggest saddness in the lark scandal is he represtned a very important segment of eve and in a moment of drunken weakness he managed to have a pro pirate csm get replaced by me, a pretty much care bear-ish csm. he did his support base a big diservice.i think lark is an interesting person and had some great ideas for eve. i understand stupid drunken decision making and i can tell you if there was ever a place to be drunk and make bad choices it is iceland! i was sad what he did was so amaturish and resulted in him not being able to continue to drive his good ideas forward. i expect more from a good pirate.you should also realize the general grumpiness i exhibited when i replaced lark was as much at ccp as lark. i found out almost a week later third hand as ccp didn't bother to let me know i was being upgraded to part of the official csm. i also found less than a warm welcome in the csm i was thrust into and i was also expected to be effective after the one time in the csm term when you really could make a difference, the face to face iceland meeting.so don't confuse my comments when i was asked to replace lark as anti-pirate. i just wanted lark, as maybe the first ""real"" pirate in the csm to have been better at it. i expect if lark was honest he would agree. in a perfect world i would have prefered he had either been way more clever about his use of inside information which would have been epic eve pirate or that he would have had a couple less of the horrible icelandic liquor shots and had not tried to make a small profit, because honestly he was doing a great job supporting the player base that voted him in. i was not able to do much for the folks i represent in the remainder of his term and certainly did nothing for his player base.so in summary, i am not anti-pirate or anti-lark, i am anti excess icelandic brennivin abuse in the csm. lark is an epic eve pirate that deserved to do better by eve and the csm and i blame brennivin! :-)i am sure my support for pirates might confuse some folks that see me as a care bear. please realize i love the risk/reward part of eve and all care bears should embrace that. in eve danger should = huge isk! that is what i want for every care bear!i hope that make sense,issler dainzea csm candidate that is a care bear that also likes pirates because they will create the risk that makes me rich!"

5/10/2010,i'll take it as a compliment.
5/10/2010,"so you are all about risk vs reward.right, what is you position on the existence of over extensive blue lists?while 0.0 does provide risk for the individual pilot and his income, the political landscape in 0.0 has evolved to a point where for most alliances only internal strife or getting harrgothed pose any significant risk.sure, if you want to introduce more risk in lvl 4s, how about balancing this by limiting the numbers of blues a supposedly bad ass alliance can have to keep them on their feet as well?(limit in number, limit in pilots numbers, something not obviously subvertable, maybe limited in distance from their core space).goal: removal of game mechanics that allow half of 0.0 to blue up."
5/10/2010,"eve needs more pvp, so i voited for u, gl mate !"
5/10/2010,"this is one tough question, i haven't got an decisive answer for.i don't want to have in-game limit on the blue list. it will be pointless, because players will just arrange coalitions out-of-game. even now it happens, when we are told not to shoot neutrals. but if ccp will introduce some mechanic to limit blue list, such ""nrds will become more common and the objective won't be achieved anyway. also, powerblocs lead to epic fights with epic fun. i enjoy this and i don't want them gone from the game.on the other hand, the landscape in 0.0 is too stale for my taste. but its downside of dominion mechanics. ccp wanted to give a chance for the smaller alliances to hold their space. and devs were successful. now it's completely possible for a smaller alliances to have corner of their own to call home, but it also means, that it's almost impossible to capture space of the stronger entity. if ccp will listen to whose, who advocate smaller gang objectives, the smaller entities won't be able to compete once more, because it's easier for a large alliance to have their fleets in various parts of the region. also the ""epic fights"" will be gone. so i don't like this solution at all.it's even possible, that solution do not exist at all. it's in human nature to group, to ""blob"". strength in numbers. but in real life, the downside of big army is the logistical nightmare that comes with it. it's hard to supply and feed large group of people. in eve, with the introduction of jump freighters, logistic is not as difficult as it was. maybe, if it was really difficult to supply large blobs, we would see less of them . i think, that the introduction of jump freighters was big mistake. ccp hasn't weighted all possible consequences and there are plenty:1. space ""became smaller"", because it's easy now with a little amount of work to get supplies from jita to any corner of 0.0. the feeling that you live in the outskirts is gone.2. freighter convoys are almost non-existent. they were really nice feature in the game. convoys made pirates' life amusing and the alliances who wanted to strike the enemy, where it hurts most, could lay down the trap for their convoy. 3. as a stated above, it also made formation of blobs easier. now you don't need to think how to supply your massive army. few players with jump freighters will make it happen. even if i would like to see jfs removed from the game, i understand, that it's impossible now. if their jump range would be nerfed, it should help a little, but i'm not entirely sure, how it would affect the game in the long run. only thing that is obvious - the logistic should not be as easy as it is now. p.s. thank you for the question. it is good one and it allowed me to ponder a problem from the different perspective."
5/10/2010,"i took the liberty to adjust a quote of your's a tad to be more correct.basicly your saying here you're not csm candidate for all eve players but only for those who fit in your playstyle.you say that risk versus reward should be more in balance. now i look back at hulkageddon.howmany hulks in that campaign were destroyed in null sec and low sec and howmany were ganked in high sec?doesn't that mean that a miners ship in high sec is more at risk than in null sec?as for smaller alliances getting their foothold in null sec i can only say this.they can get a foothold if the big boys around don't mind. if they don't want you there you have null chance.it's easy to say to remove insurance as a whole when you have an alliance pulling in billions per day from null sec mining, plexing and ratting, so the whole concept of it all hurting a lot in null sec is void.suicide ganking in high sec when done propperly the risk versus reward is also not really present. you can get a lot out of it.ow and i live in null sec and then in empire again and then again in null sec. so i do know both sides of the picture.empire is in game for a reason and by just shoving that aside it's pretty clear that you only play a narrow part in the game and as such only have a narrow vision about the game.this is all my personal opinion and has nothing to do with my corporation, alliance."
5/10/2010,"do not twist my words. i am candidate for the people, who enjoy pvp and i haven't claimed anything else. but bear in mind, that eve is a pvp game. are you really so clueless? hulks in nullsec are more careful and/or they are guarded by the corp mates. gankers know this and only few would dare to try to hunt for hulks in 0.0 . on the other side, miners in highsec for whatever reason feel perfectly safe. and because of their carelessness they died and will die. it's perfectly reasonable, don't you think so? rl politics look just the same - smaller countries listen to what more powerful say. insurance removal will hurt everyone. in case of 0.0, mostly the alliance wallets will suffer, but they will suffer nonetheless. it needs lots of work and preparation or just stupidity of the victim to be profitable. anyway, it's fine. it should be so."
5/10/2010,how do you feel about certain people in your corp somehow ratting 23/7 in mjxw-p and rci-vl in delve (behave almost as if not controlled by player)?
5/10/2010,"your exact words were may i ask who appointed you god and the one being to say who is and who isn't fit for this game? are you really so clueless? hulks in nullsec are more careful and/or they are guarded by the corp mates. gankers know this and only few would dare to try to hunt for hulks in 0.0 . on the other side, miners in highsec for whatever reason feel perfectly safe. and because of their carelessness they died and will die.you try to rebottle by pointing out that mining in null sec is way more dangerous due to the fact that there are no concord and other penaties against those who attack hulks. however you do forget to mention the fact that every null sec alliance has at the very least 1 intell channel. anyone approaching a miningop can be detected many jumps out already.heck back in 2004 we even managed to provide intell on enemy ship movements towards mining ops. ok given it's not 100% failsafe but still.suicide gankers who want to blow up your hulk in empire high sec aren't that easy detected. there is no blue / red / grey list in high sec because that would cripple high sec operations as a whole.the mining ops i have seen in 0.0 were a lost of time taking place in scanned out belts and a lot of times in systems where there are pos to hop to when trouble heads their way.so once again, what makes mining in null sec more dangerous than mining in high sec? it's perfectly reasonable, don't you think so? rl politics look just the same - smaller countries listen to what more powerful say.why are you so eager to pull real life politics and all into a game? if you want to pull in reality then under what category would you place the expansion and warlust of the socalled powerblocks?the need to urge everyone to go shoot and kill just for the sake of more territorail gain?you make it sound like the wild west, but on that note. even the wild west grew up at some point. insurance removal will hurt everyone. in case of 0.0, mostly the alliance wallets will suffer, but they will suffer nonetheless.ow i think a few trillion isk gathered over time can withstand some replacing, which once again makes the grip that powerblocks have on certain spots in eve more solid.the real big battles would evaporate if there wasn't a fat alliance wallet in the back and as a result the movement in the political and social structure in 0.0 would eventually grow stale. it needs lots of work and preparation or just stupidity of the victim to be profitable. anyway, it's fine. it should be so.[/quote"

(and not a whole lot survive to recieve the highest honor tha tthe us can give it's military personal. and the same thing goes for i have no doubt in my mind every other country that has ever sent soliders to war. admiral yamamoto and sun tzu were great men and warriors that believe in peace above all things and that war was athema. yet the did what their countries asked them to do and tried to do it with honor and min loss of life. (ya ya wwii was as bloody as it gets and the horror went to all sides. no country has a clear conscience about who got killed and why. general westmoreland was the ""leader"" of the us forces in the south east asia war games (better known as the viet nam war) {there was no such thing! it was never declared anything at all ""officially"" by congress. nothing at all, not a police action, not a peace kepping mission, certainly not a war} yet thousands of us personnel and asians died because that scum sucking ****er westmorland wanted his picture in the paper and a big enemy body count so he could be come the ""greatess general of his time"" he was a pompuss, narrow minded, shorth sight jumped up twit"
5/10/2010,"just like armstrong custer. but how do you tell the fanilies of all the people killed fighting for something nobody wanted it was just the us diplomats and war mongers against the chinese diplomats and their war mongers going to toe toe and using everyone caught in the middle as pawns. some say jane fonda was either the greatest patirot or the greatest traiter since benidict arnold but i will tell you here and now that westmoreland was the biggest toy solider in the known world for all time. we fought and a lot died so that you and people like you can get online or write or protest your narrow minded little heads off and if i had to i would still do it again. i can spent most of my life working disaters either nature or man made one way or another. i have done everything i could to protect and help the injured and hungry and the lost and i will continue to do so till either i can't or i die. who have you helped lately? anyone at all and i am not talking about dropping money in somebodies hat i mean help help like take a first responders course, learn cpr, stop to help someone that's fallen down or hurt? don't worry i don't expect an answer from you or anyone else. bet i get some santimonious twit that does though anyway my point if you haven't figured it out is yes i am a loud mouth, yes i am a buthole, yes i have things to say. yes yes yes i am all of that and more. but at least i stand up and shout it to the world and try to fix what is wrong. have you ever tried to fix anything little man? may you all live in intresting times and remember for evile to take over it only requires that good men/woman do nothing. i allways get that quote a little wrong everytime. but it's still the truth."

5/10/2010,bump with my vote!
5/10/2010,"well, back in csm3, we managed to get ccp to agree to dedicate at least 1 team to 'industry' related projects for each expansion. while that is a fairly broad agreement, ccp did ask for us to provide a list of issues/ideas for them to work from, as well as their own backlog. after asking what the players thought were the most pressing issues (here & here), a lot of people focussed on the ui area of the game, as well as expanding on how production & science could evolve more. from the looks of planetary interaction, this seems to be the road that ccp is taking (allowing player creation of previously npc seeded goods). one of the major points was that a massive % of minerals were being supplied by loot, and that has prompted ccp to look at reducing that mineral source in tyrannis.following on from that, i'd like to see low-level production and production chains fleshed out a little more, possibly having 0.0 and lowsec being used as areas to create specific items (such as implants or datacores), or at least the building blocks for them, to give players a few more reasons to populate those areas rather than staying in empire.i'm also intending to raise the t2 bpo issue should i make it on to the csm - at this point i'm neither for nor against removing t2 bpo's, but i would like ccp to research their effects on the markets of eve, and draw their own conclusions from it, preferably with consultation from the playerbase via the csm.(sorry, no lyrics this time)"
5/10/2010,i have been watching the csm closely and i have noticed that the csm aren't any better than real politicians.it starts with the candidates introducing themselves and their idea's and such. this is before the voting is open.then just barely before the votings open the real politics come into play.it's not about the politician's strongpoints anymore. it's about throwing as much mud as possible on other politicians. so much easier to blacken others than highlighting your own strongpoints.offcourse in the meanwhile in their following they scream and shout to make their blackballing more vocal and hence the puppets pop up and pick up the slack to slander even more. et voila a real campaign is born.thing that actually worries me most is the real chance we get some little berlusconi in the csm for a long long time because we have enough voters who have a hard time looking further than their own personal playstyle and even more voters who won't even vote.
5/10/2010,"its pretty disgusting. i think that all this mudthrowing makes the csm lose credit from a lot of players. it is more and more about egos and less about actually serving the people that elected them. the csm must work together. with all this insulting and mud being thrown between candidates, i fear that cooperation will be thrown out of the window at some point and the csm just turns in a bunch of whiners flailing at eachother. is the mudthrowing just election drama, and will the csm just laugh about it and get to work after the elections? csm1 was horribly ineffective due to all the drama and infighting and i don't want to see a repeat of this. whenether you agree with another candidate or not, deal with it and treat eachother with respect!"
5/10/2010,when does questioning candidates statements suddenly turn into mud slinging or trolling?when the candidate cant wriggle out of it i guess
5/10/2010,"questioning is one thing, but the slander and smearing that goes on in several threads just clearly shows we have more to do with emo-queens than people who actually want to help better the game for everyone.people more busy with obtaining the seat and at all cost stay in it rather than doing what they are supposed to do."
5/10/2010,when you aren't interested in the answer and just ask the question to put the candidate in bad light.
5/10/2010,"i don't understand why people hate negative campaigning so much. yeah, it can go too far, but there is a valid role for it. informed voters are a good thing, and it's not like a politician is going to inform you of their weaknesses. the only people who have any reason to do that are opponents of that candidate. not all attacks are accurate, but then again, not all self-promotion is accurate either. just look at ankh's thread for many examples of both."
5/10/2010,"negative campainging usually happens when people run short of pressing their strong points forward.it's a clear showing of weakness if your only validation is by distracting away from them by pushing forward other people's weaknesses.someone representing others should win on own merits and not in smearing oppositions, i know it's a utopia to think so, specially nowadays where the loudmouth attract more following than the one who tries to get ahead on his own merits.discussions on real life politics are not allowed.applebabemight there be hope for mankind afterall?mankind perhaps, evekind i am less hopefull for."
5/10/2010,"i do absolutely no mud throwing, but i will pay 250m per vote."
5/10/2010,or perhaps it just shows that you're running against someone who has flaws. perhaps even flaws that voters ought to know about. but i suppose it's more important to act nice in a competitive election than it is to have an informed voter pool.
5/10/2010,anyone who doesn't have the points to win on merits but only by pointing to other people's flaws doesn't have much of an agenda then.

5/11/2010,confirming this is the most important issue.
5/11/2010,yes please
5/11/2010,"it's not really just that. i mean, just try to fit a brutix with any sort of armor tank and decent guns (like a neutron/ion mix or full rack of neutrons which you need a grid mod for even with a shield tank). it's just not going to happen, because of the horrible fitting. plus, you need some speed to actually catch anything and the shield brutix and myrmidon have it.oh, about shield tanking stuff... with the advent of the scram, short range meshes with shield tank really well. for instance, i'm one of the people who has both a hg slaveset and a lg snakeset. yet when fitting a, eg. short range ac hurricane i'll very often just go with a shield tank with a scrambler, suck up getting half the ehp in order to be able to catch various speedy trash and hold it there. look at myrm fits; you can get a quite fast (particularly with snakes) ship which has very solid ehp and does 850+ dps on top, to the point where despite having a hg slaveset (enabling you to have 100k ehp on it) if i wanted to go with blasters and stuff i'd go with snaked shieldfit."
5/11/2010,"i've said this before on the same issue. skirmish ships can still be skirmish ships even if blaster ships are faster and more agile than them. the key part about being a skirmish ship is not just speed and agility, its speed, agility, and the ability to run when things turn against you.minmitar ships with their large number of free high slots(neuts), range that allows them to effectively combat ships outside of web/2pt range, and med slots(shield tank allows more mobility), will still have that advantage even if they are not the fastest ships on the field.blaster ships can never benefit as much as minmatar ships because if things do go bad, they don't have the neuts to get rid of tacklers, and they're certainly not outside of web/2 pt range even if they run shield tanks and light tackle in order to maximize their speed advantage (which they aren't as good as due to having fewer med slots generally). this means that even if you make blaster ships fast and agile, or faster and more agile than minmatar ships, the minmatar ships will still be the skirmish race and the blaster ships will still be the ""balls to the wall"" race.but. if you go the other way, and you have the short range ships slower than the longer range ships then there is no reason to ever choose that short range ship. in actual combat, when things are fighting back, no one will ever be in range except other short range ships. everyone else will be using their higher speed to kite. since no one is in range except short range ships, the advantage is to choose the longer range ships and kite like them. its the same strategic choice set that has spawned nano-fits each and every time they have been viable for each and every iteration. it is not a coincidence that they always choose to use long range options(and tracking free options when available) rather than short range. with the trichotomy that we have (consisting of short range/high damage/full tackle, med range/disengable, long range/unagile) if the short range/full tackle range ships are not the fastest, they never become a viable choice compared to the med range/disengagable ships."

(long story short, giving up ehp means that unless they catch something unawares, a combat ship is likely to be able to kill the rax before the rax kills it, and that is in a 1v1 situation where raw damage has more of an advantage over range, as you start to add ships the ability to inflict damage now becomes a bigger deal with the exception of a very few edge cases involving big active tanked ships that can't run away and can't kill cruisers)"
5/11/2010,"more faster and agile than minmatar? not supported.high dps, better drone bays, speed, how the hell do you disengage from that? will you have time for it?i understand that blasters/acs need to dictate range and that really should not be trivial for both (it is trivial for minmatar now), but with this it really looks you're just turning the table 180<U+FFFD>, nothing more.sorry but you can make better than that. you've done it before :-pplay with drones perhaps?obs: stupid stuff but speed changes always hurt a bit inside, only reason why i choose minmatar when i created my 1st char."
5/11/2010,"you've got to be very careful when proposing ships that are both fast and agile, as unless that ship has serious weaknesses in dps or tank, then it's going to be very powerful. the combination of good speed and good agility produces good acceleration - definable as 0.75 * (max speed with mwd on) / (align time with mwd on). good acceleration and high speed means that you accelerate more quickly to a higher top speed than other ships, making such a ship very powerful. the dramiel is a case in point.in general, ships should be fast or agile. take caldari ships, which tend to be agile but slow. this gives them good acceleration but a low top speed, which means that they can pull away from another ship briefly, but then get overhauled in the long run. this is well balanced. but how should the other races be?minmatar should be the fastest. but if minmatar is faster, more agile and has weapons with longer range than gallente, then there is very little reason to fly gallente, assuming fairly similar tanks and dps - as is broadly the case. this suggests that minmatar should not be an agile race, and that gallente ships should have an advantage in acceleration but a disadvantage in top speed."
5/11/2010,"this is an interesting comment, but i think falls short a bit. minmatar is the small/fast/agile race, and i hope they stay that way. you cite the dramiel as proof that something shouldn't have good dps and be both fast and agile... but the jaguar and vagabond (while good) are nothing approaching overpowered - while embodying all of the core concepts of being minmatar. even with all that, it wasn't minmatar that kept people from flying blaster ships - it was lasers (which projectiles have been balanced against recently).imo i think it depends what role you're trying to go for... and with blaster and laser ships that's the ""damage dealer"" role. minmatar ships as a rule don't really fill this role. as i said, there's only a few options:- make blaster ships able to get to their targets in a timely manner and without expending 2-3 cap booster 800s to do it. (read: make them faster and/or more agile)- make blaster ships have nuts high dps to offset the time it takes to get into range.- extend blaster range so that they come into range sooner- make lasers (and therefore projectiles and torps and pretty much everything else) do less damage.-liang"
5/11/2010,"i want to point out why that would be a horrible idea, in case someone may accidentally take it seriously.not only that is unrealistic request due to overwhelming protest it would cause from entire community. but you need to understand that tanking has been continuously boosted for last several years, while weapon damage seen much smaller increases. the latest boost was to make 15% buffer rigs for cruisers, bc, frigates very affordable - essentially giving everyone who wants another free full grade slave set or equivalent shield tank set. something that normally would cost at least 1500 million now costs 9 mil. and that's just one of the many tanking boosts.and in case it's not clear to some people, excessive tanking ability leads to blobbing - as it both requires more people to efficiently kill the target and gives victim more time to call in friendly blob from nearby. i was under impression we didn't like the blobbing trends."
5/11/2010,"this is entirely untrue. some people might have thought it was true, but it assumes that gallente should be gang damage dealers. they should not be. the problem has always been ships with longer ranges that cannot be caught by the blaster ships. bull if you consider blaster ships as a ""damage dealer role"" then you must also consider minnie in that role. you have to define the roles more closely to properly understand what is happening here. each of the ships discussed does deal damage as their primary function. each just does so optimally in different situations.those different situations are the key.these are pretty much right out. falloff means that blaster ship dps increases necessarily nullify non-te autocannon range.adding range is also right out, this negates the role of blasters as solo/small gang damage dealers and moves them right into skirmish options.ditto number three since it has the same effect as number onethat means that the only proper response is to make them faster and more agile."
5/11/2010,"once again i'm reminded how messed up in the head goumindong is. i haven't forgotten the nano nerf fiasco. the sad part is that ccp game designer seem to be just as messed up as this guy.he simply cannot be reasoned with, cause his logic obeys the rules of some parallel universe, not quite like ours.there's really no point arguing with him. but if the devs are messed up in similar ways and they follow this bad advice, i can assure you that the next big threads are going to be cries of the minmatar. the game will shift one more notch toward boredom, as the differences between ships are erased. balance through sameness is achieved."
5/11/2010,"i don't think the vaga is overpowered either. but i do think that the deimos is underpowered. given that both of these ships are best utilised in solo or small-gang combat, how should they be balanced against each other? i don't think a deimos fix will come via fiddling with its dps - the deimos would have to have an immense dps advantage to be rated alongside the vaga, given the vaga's mobility and dps-projection advantages. to me, this suggests that the answer to balancing these ships is something to do with their mobilities. now it's obvious that the vaga should be faster than the deimos. so just leaves acceleration as the advantage that deimos could have. with reasonable fits, currently they compare like this:dual-poly vaga: speed 2750 m/s, average acceleration 298 m/s/s.800 mm dual-poly deimos: speed 1712 m/s, acceleration 157 m/s/s.shield nanodeimos: speed 1961 m/s, acceleration 226 m/s/s.the problem is - what numbers would a faster-accelerating deimos have? let's assume that speeds remain the same. if we give the shield deimos an acceleration of 350 m/s/s, then it requires a align time with mwd on of 4.2 s, which is probably silly. alternatively, if we nerf the vaga's acceleration to 175 m/s/s, then it gets a mwd-on align time of 11.8 s, which would probably give a mwd-off align time of 8.2 s ish. unfortunately, this, too, is probably silly..."
5/11/2010,"gypsio iii, i believe that a 20% damage increase (a free damage mod) would go a long way to helping deimos, without making that ship overpowered due to its other shortcomings.there's an alternative solution tho - changing mwd bonus to 90% web bonus, it would make deimos highly desirable in small gang pvp. but then it takes away from vigilant advantage."
5/11/2010,"well... if the rails with this penetration idea were balanced to the point where it took the same amount of time (on average) to kill a target as other long range weapon systems, how would it matter? sure maybe a ship dies with xx% of it's primary tank left, but if it takes the same amount of time to die to (for example) long-range lazors it's the same for all intensive purposes. some tank types would probably last longer than others, but that's the same for every weapon.how would you go about getting that perfect balance? not sure. how would it turn out with mass rails firing? probably badly. but then fleet arties on a target usually turns out badly too.would probably be the first response when a titan died with some of it's primary tank left."
5/11/2010,"the complaint here is that eve is too homogeneous - that there's no variation. but fleets aren't homogeneous, and ehp isn't all that matters. you might be able to balance this around one single form of combat - unfortunately, this would enforce even more of that homogeneity by virtue of introducing mechanics which obsolete most types of combat.first, its intents and purposes. second, you cannot possibly take the ""same amount of time"" when you bypass the primary tank, except in very specific types of combat. i already covered this, complete with ""mathematical proof"".by not introducing mechanics that are guaranteed to be overpowered. its a good start anyway. much more likely to be the response the first time someone dies with an active tank or in a rr gang with virtually full armor and no hull. and you can't even avoid this fate because that's the whole point of the mechanic. there may be ways to balance rails with different effects, but bypassing a layer isn't one of them. give it up.-liang"
5/11/2010,"no liang, that's not what it is at all. that's what you are reading into it. it wasn't a complaint, it was a question. which you didn't answer. i happen to think eve is anything but homogeneous. and that's what makes it a good game. but rails do need some help, and this idea does seem interesting.ummm... thanks? never realized you were such a grammar national socialist. and yeah, you certainly proved that spugg's figures wouldn't work as he originally posted them. kinda think he already agreed that the figures would need to be tweaked. if dps was dropped and/or the odds of penetration were lowered you could possibly have it take the same amount of time. if you change the numbers going in, you can get w/e result you like coming out. for an active tank - once again, if they died in the same amount of time as they would from lasers, arties, or cruise missiles would it make a difference? yes or no. and after you answer that liang, let's go one further. how about if it took longer?for rr gangs - well, it would make a nice change from the only options being massive ecm, massive neuting, or massive blobbing. (personally, not a huge fan of how rr gangs work atm.)"
5/11/2010,"this was something that really interested me. rails would still be a poor weapon to beat your enemy in a straight 'fire power' fight which seems to becoming more and more the way people play the game. penetrating damage will not allow you to kill the target 'quicker'. i t will probably take longer, but its a tactical weapon in this form. example being the rr gang. instead of bringing an even bigger gang, or massive ecm, you have the tactical choice of 'breaking' the tank with a tactical weapon. it will probably take a long time too. as the chance to penetrate is quite small (say a shield tank has 40% shield and is at 75% armour. chance to penetrate shields is 60% and chance to penetrate armour with the same volley is 15%. it would take a while to get to this situation too), and the damage to bleed through gets modified to be quite low. 'tickling' your target to death, or the 'death of a thousand cuts'also, if you think that everyone in the fleet will just fit rails then they will be pwned by a fleet of beams and arties as they will just get under the 20km and use their tracking advantage to counter."
5/11/2010,stop posting. you're embarrassing yourself
5/11/2010,... you were doing ok until this paragraph. a) beams & arties also suck for tracking. b) sniper fleets that get caught at 20km are doing something horribly horribly wrong
5/11/2010,"i know this, i was just using it as an extreme way to counter a fleet of rail platforms.its annoying how quickly people are at smacking people down without thinking about the context that something was said. alot of people rush to the ""i'm right, you're wrong!"" phrase or smacking without thinking about whats actually been saidgoum, i have a lot of respect to your views and knowledge of the game, all i'm asking is that people broaden their views and think a little laterally.thanks for your previous feed back too vlad.i've been trying to simulate the chance based system of this mechanic and so i've found that an active armour tank can keep the chances of sustaining hull damage very, very low. from what i can tell the mechanic i've described doesn't appear to 'punish' a buffer tank over an active tank or vice versa though i haven't looked at an active shield fit yet."
5/11/2010,"no, that was exactly his complaint with boosting damage - because somehow rails become exactly like lasers and artillery despite the very significant differences.i'm not. i'm educating you. i admit the place i linked to was a bit brusque, but it was just the first hit in the goog which illustrated the difference. you're welcome.first, it's not a yes or no question... and i'm answering it for the second time. you see, i didn't just show with those numbers that it was flawed... i showed that it was flawed no matter what numbers you throw into it! you will, by necessity, always come up with one of these two results:- rails are ridiculously overpowered and virtually eliminate the usefulness of active tanking, rr (both large and small), passive recharge tanking, and most forms of buffer tanking. we all fit hull tanks (yay diversity?) and pray we have a friend with a capital hull rep handy. - rails don't do enough damage penetration to matter, and now we're left with ""flavor"" without ""effect"". people are still whining that rails suck... and rightfully so. good job!!!!and just to be sure that you don't miss it: as long as there is damage penetration and any sort of repair, you can't possibly have ""just the same amount of time to kill someone"". you can rig it to work against pure ehp systems (which is what he's trying to do), but eve isn't about just pure ehp!i'm glad to know that you're willing to sacrifice all logistics anywhere (including from the specialized ships operated solo) to kill this. how about we just remove local, remote, and passive repair from the game just so this hairbrained idea can work. like i said - continue brainstorming... but this idea cannot possibly be balanced."
5/11/2010,"more properly.you could possibly balance it against any one of the following1) pure ehp tanks2) any single repair tank with specific amounts of ehp repairedso you could balance it against ehp tanks, but then it would be out of whack against all repair tanks. or you could balance it against a 100 effective hit point repair tank... but it would not be balanced against a 200 effective hit point repair tank, or a 300 ehp repair tank or a 400....balance against any of them necessitates imbalance against the rest. ergo it cannot be balanced."
5/11/2010,"which perfectly explains why you quoted me... or you were using your normal tactics when trying to shut somebody up. your grammar is wrong, ergo your entire argument is...actually it is. it's a hypothetical question. you can certainly tack on a reasoning to supplement your answer, but the question is simple and straightforward. ummm... no. actually liang in this rather crude form it would drastically favor buffer tanks over active tanking. you're either resorting to hyperbole, or forgot to have your coffee this morning. cuz your math is normally much better. considering the number of times you have mentioned active tanking, i'm beginning to think you're doing some white knighting here. does active tanking need to be kicked in the gonads yet again? probably not. and admittedly that is an issue with the idea. doesn't make the idea unbalanced. would just make active tanking suck even more. example - lasers really do a number on shield tanks, and yet lasers are not overpowered.so our two options are overpowered or suck? forgive me if i don't subscribe to your rather extreme world view. (there's a freebie for another petty barb.) it's a numbers game liang. anything can be balanced. probably wouldn't be easy to do in this case though. much simpler solution is the one you are apparently favoring - just boost damage. works? yes. likely solution? yes. only possible solution? no.yup, you're white knighting active tanks. not quite, but please don't let me stop your exaggerated comments. you'd probably do better leaving this to goum.succinct, to the point, and devoid of snarky comments! i disagree that it ""necessitates imbalance"" though. it just favors one form of tanking over another. is it really necessary to favor buffer tanks even more in this day and age? probably not. but still an interesting idea."

5/11/2010,definitely support this. field command ships are fairly overshadowed by the bcs.
5/11/2010,hmm it seems to me that with planetary interaction low-sec could become more interesting and would also open it up to more ideas like those mentioned.just on it's own it's going to cause people to come out and pick up the goods they are producing.

5/11/2010,"hacked accounts. a threat that looms over even the most careful of individuals. the worst thing possible that can happen to anyone on eve-online, or the internet in general is your account information being compromised, and someone else gaining access to your hard work for free. there are numerous ways this can happen, some even skilled and experienced computer users can still be caught by.what i propose is a device used by some businesses for their employees to log in remotely to their systems, as well as a device similar to the one implemented for world of warcraft via activision blizzard. an authentication device.this is by no means a required addition to anyone's account. rather is it an optional layer of security that can be added if the user so chooses. currently the methods available are either a small keychain like device that generates a number, or a download for your cellphone. either way the overall outcome is the same. an added layer of security for accounts for those who choose it to help protect their investment from security breeches.naturally many people will feel that their own measures are enough, but players like me wouldn't mind spending a few extra dollars to purchase such a device to ensure the safety of my account. afterall, we've all put numerous years into these character's of ours. and unlike other games, we can't just ""level to 80"" within a week or two and pick up where we left off. these characters require our dedication, and deserve as much protection for them as we can get."
5/11/2010,"since it doesn't let me support my topic initially.there's also been some confusion from what i've heard with how these work. i'll give activision blizzard as an easy example for how this functions.first you purchase an authenticator, either the physical device of the program for a smart phone. you are then given a serial number which you attach to whichever account(s) you desire the authenticator to attach to. now when you log in to that account you must use the authenticator to generate a number, and enter the number to get access to your account.to some this adds another step that might be frustrating due to quickly swapping characters and having to generate a new number constantly. but on the other hand it adds a physical layer of protection that requires the device in your hand too log in to your account. there is no software involved. it's all handled via your account settings. all you would need is eve-online installed and the authenticator to log on."

5/11/2010,sorted.
5/11/2010,"i think low sec needs cleaned out. i am all for more things to do in high sec that are pve oriented. actually i think those that have positive security status should be able to join up with the concord and the 4 empires and clean out low sec. free podding and killing of all with negitive status. give the ""care bears"" teeth without sec status loss and let us clean up the waste of space pirates."
5/11/2010,"when a person receives a bounty, they can easily claim the bounty reward through an alt.i propose these bounties to remain on a pilot and can only be claimed through a bounty hunter, also we should have a new way of bounty hunting.using a rank system (to prevent exploiters) have certain people marked to certain players.for example, 5 pilots have bounties, nothing will happen to these guys but say a pilot contacts the bounty office, he / she will be assigned several missions to take out these people.the time depended to take out these people will be from 24hrs to 1 week (depending on sec status, like if a pilot has -10, he will have a 1 week hit on him)once again depending on the sec status depends how many people are assigned to the hit.the chance of getting a bounty hunt on you depends on how much bounty is on you, so people who like putting 10k comical bounties on themselves wont see a hit often but people who have say 50 million will, excessively high bounties like 5 billion will only be assigned to high ranking bounty hunterswhen a person gets a hit on them they will receive a mail explaining the hit and kill rights pop up, i am not sure what grace period would be adequate for this but i dont want it same as wardecs atm lets say a player gets a 12hour grace periodthe rank you receive will be based on the sec status / amount of isk on that bounty and to prevent exploiting / laming, 10% of the bounty received will go directly to ded (npcs).ranks will also decay over time, putting some competition in this, higher ranks will mean better bounty missions or more assigned to you and to have access to items where you can buy for isk.if a pilot fails to complete a bounty (most likely because the bounty is perma docked ) no penalty will be given.when the grace period is over both the bounty hunter and bounty can attack each other careless of who gets the first shot.in addition to this i think people with high concord standings should be allowed bounties on them however these bounties can only be placed by high ranking bounty hunters and will only be assigned to high ranking bounty hunters, the timers to kill the bounty will be significantly reduced though.oh and for the sake of pvp, bounty hunters (for a price) can mark other similar ranking bounty hunters, this will allow them to compete for rank through a more familiar way and i guess welcomes back a new 1v1 pvp feel.all of these features / add ons can only be requested / inquired in a station with a bounty hunter service, a pilot may decline the mission he has received but this will result in a ranking loss, no loss will be given to failed missions (thanks to docking)."
5/11/2010,"few more things to change to make this work/alternatives to make this work.1st the bounty should be bound to the clone to whitch the bounty is given. so that a person can end up with 6 different bountysums. reason to this is to prevent the usage of an alt to pop the main even thuru bountyhunting system.2nd bountyhunters should be granted to usage of somekind of warpdisrupt bubble to actually be able to get the pod. 0.0 dwellers not many of them have any bountys and in lowsec the ones who has good bountys newer loose the pod. so give the hunters a bubble, that will affect only the huntee.uglyedit: typos"
5/11/2010,"uuuuh.... tbh, i don't see where one wouldn't be able to use an alt.the only thing you did was making the system so complex that the majority of players wouldn't bother bounty anymore. intended?"
5/11/2010,"i think the op solution is overly complicated, but has a few good ideas:1. a system of bounty mission assignments (all pilots with bounties currently online) so that collection of bounty by alt is not possible except through extraordinary luck.2. kill rights in any system that are transferrable to bounty hunter's gang.3. concord significantly pad all bounties to make even comical bounties worthwhile.4. a bounty hunter interface that provides current locations of all current targets.5. a special assassin module you can activate on a station that has a docked pilot in it with bounty in it that pods them in station after 30 minutes if they don't undock. :)supporting some kind of change to the bounty system since it is completely dysfunctionl currently."

5/11/2010,"ecm is wayyyyyy over powered. i can't stand how many good fights have been completely ruined to a jamming ship. its really just a fail safe that most rookies sport when they aren't confident in their abilities.but this whole just breaking the lock type of deal, couldn't that in term just lead to the same thing? as you said it could break your lock during locking...and if it keep hitting, isn't that perma jammed?i always just think ecm should do what it does technically..jam. it would be kind of cool that it would jam your turret's. so instead of your grouped modules of 7 shooting seven times, 4 of the guns gets ""jamed"" which keeps you sending off some ammo and only 3 of your guns shoot that cycle. but thats just what i think would be cool, dont really think it should ever be implemented."
5/11/2010,i hate ecm its the biggest turn off in small gang pvp so any change to nerf it some more is good in my book
5/11/2010,ecm is still far too strong. this proposal looks good but there are some details that need to be tested as a 5 second cycle time sounds way too fast.
5/11/2010,"the way ecm works seems out of place given the mechanics of the other types of ewar, i think this would help bring it more in line with the rest.also kudos on the nicely done up proposal, it's refreshing to see on this board."
5/11/2010,"i say remove ecm from the game completely, but wtv this will do."
5/11/2010,"there are a lot of problems in eve that people complain about but i believe i've come up with a solution which will help solve a few of them. problems1) low and even null sec need a bit more activity.2) high sec level 4 missions need a risk vs reward re-balance.3) miners really get screwed by the mineral dump from high sec lvl 4's.these 3 problems could easily be solved by simply removing ""all"" positive quality level 4 agents from high sec and placing them in low sec.this would effectively re-balance the high sec risk vs reward income levels. if a mission runner wanted to run lvl4's in the safety of high sec, he still could but he would earn less isk and lp points per hour.if the mission runner was willing to deal with extra risk, he could in turn run level 4's from higher quality agents in low sec. this would re-balance the risk vs reward that is needed in regard to high sec level 4's.doing this you would also help re-balance other areas in eve. miners and manufactures would get a much needed income boost because there would be much less reprocessed minerals and meta 1 items on the market. this in turn would be a much needed income buff for both miners & manufactures. new low sec mission hubs would be created which would open up new opportunity for less risk adverse marketers. allowing low sec to finally support working markets due to enough population.mission runners could finally fight back against ninja salvagers whom steal there space debris.with the advent of t3 cruisers with the ability to fit un-probable set ups, there is no real reason that this should not be considered as there is still a reasonable amount of safety to be had, for the mission runners if they fit proper ships while in low sec.this in return would effectively re-balance level 4 mission income placing by added the much needed risk vs reward. this would also help push high sec care bears into 00 by giving them a reason to leave the safety of high.it would also be the much needed boon for piracy in low sec and give people a reason to do something besides gate camp 24/7.overall a simple readjustment such as this, would provide a stimulus package for many professions in eve as well as low sec."
5/11/2010,1. you earn already more from lvl4s in lowsec.2. minerals issue is already getting nerfed.maybe do your homework before posting?
5/11/2010,"perhaps you should also read before posting. yes there is a slight increase for doing missions in low sec. this would be a re-balance by moving ""all"" positive quality level 4 agents to low sec.this would not just increase the amount in earned in low sec but it would ""decrease"" the amount made in high sec. effectively giving a real ""risk vs reward"" option.as of right now there is no worthwhile reward to leave high sec to run level 4's. this would create a reason."
5/11/2010,i have read your proposal. but unlike ran khanon you dont understand that it doesnt solve the real problem why people dont run missions in lowsec.if you want to buff lowsec... think about ways that dont nerf other people's play style to feed yours.
5/11/2010,"the funny thing here is that agent quality is relatively minor in relation to how much isk/hr you make. the far more overriding factor is the security status of the space you're in. what i would propose in your shoes is actually a bit more sweeping. instead of suggesting nerfing high sec, i think you should instead look to the problems with low sec space. low sec space, as a whole, is dangerous, and even lawless. however, the reward differences vary quite dramatically and for no reason between a 0.1 and a 0.4.this affects missions, rats, exploration, mining, etc. ccp has made an effort to make all regions of 0.0 ""equally"" attractive with the new sov mechanics, and i think that this effort should be applied to low sec. i would say that the rewards from living in 0.1 space are sufficient - simultaneously being distinctly less profitable than even the worst 0.0 space and distinctly better than 0.5 space. thus, i would suggest making all of low sec - regardless of system security - use the same game mechanics as 0.1 space.you can read more about this idea here:"
5/11/2010,"i'm not going to argue with you all day. if you don't support the proposal then don't support it and be on your way. the idea behind my proposal is to create a ""reason"" for people to run low sec level 4's. right now as i've already mention there is ""no"" reason to run them do to high sec being more profitable due to easier access.everyone knows high sec mission income is un-balance leaving little reason for many to ever venture to low or null sec. this would be a step in the right direction of giving them a reason.as for making low sec easier to navigate. yes, i do agree with this as i've also made the similar suggestions. you can read it here in another post i made on needed changes to low sec."
5/11/2010,well i would of course like to see more sweeping changes with in low sec and eve in general. this is just a simple solution which can work with-in the current game mechanics with out a lot of extra changes on ccp's part.it is also a change that can be made over time by not moving all agents at once. this means it would not have drastic effects on the economy by one major sweeping change.
5/11/2010,there are activities in hi sec that generate far more income than lvl 4 missions already.
5/11/2010,"there is a problem with levi bonus actually.is bonus of 37.5% of shield for the gang, is in fact a great part of his tank.but you have only this bonus when are in gang. an erebus get full armor directly when it go in gang. but levi not, and need 24h of wait to get full hp, or use a shield booster, that make a weaker tank instead of get a invul.i want ccp change this, the leviathan has less ehp than a mothership because of this.an aeon t2 fited is about 50m, mine leviathan is 21m. ... wtf ???i'm just asking for the bonus applyed in gang or not in gang to the ship. that make not the player recharge his ship each jump or something esle.i think it's a good idea, hope you found it too."
5/11/2010,"think of it this way.erebus gets a short term bonusleviathan gets a long term bonusafter all, armor plates don't recharge themselves like shields. once they're damaged, they're damaged."
5/11/2010,bastard
5/11/2010,"i know this was discussed a while back, not sure if csm picked it up though. basically, after some discussion, the conclusion people came to was that there should be a grace period(maybe 30s) for changing systems whereby your shield doesn't drop. that way, you can move the fleet without losing your hp buffer, once you have it fully recharged. such a solution i would support."
5/11/2010,"all titans are maxed for ehp.most titans use mwd in med slot, for levi it's a tank slot that can be used. also, all titans fit a sensor booster for lock faster targets. erebus can fit two easily. ( avatar it's same buisness ) without sacrifice of tank.a erebus when i lost 10% or armor when it get its fleet bonus, the armor that it get it on right, not on left in red. he never need to recharge his armor before a fight.a levi need, so you must have a capital shield booster, with sacrifice the tank.tank on a levi cost a lot. officier invul are very high priced. x-type hardener on armor are very cheap.an erebus t2 fited is 50m ehp easy. deadspace : near 100m ehp. yeah you slaves too.a normal fit on leviathan is 21ehp.you have 1m of shield from bonus, that you can't use.a total about 4m of shield with lower resist on a levi, and aroung 8m of armor on a erebus. that's not normal."

5/11/2010,"did you really just insinuate that killing ratters is pvp? technically it is, i know, but challenge wise you might as well be shooting rats yourself has to be combined it with a non carpal tunnel syndrome inducing ship scanner or no dice."

5/11/2010,"currently mission running brings in an insane no risk amount of isk, i myself make about 80 mil an hour, i think to balance the money making mechanics, we move all lvl 4 agents in local lowsec.this will also making mining profitable again (macros rejoice) and will also increase low sec population.i understand carebears will feel upset and angry by this, but as i said i mission run and know how much risk free isk is produced, i for one would love to see lowsec populated and this suggestion will solve 2 of my problems."
5/11/2010,oh yes. ccp is there to solve your problems...
5/11/2010,"lvl 5 agents are already in low sec. for example, but no one actually runs them there, they wait for one that comes up in high sec. not everyone is here fir the pvp, so leave them where they are."
5/11/2010,i bet it will
5/11/2010,considering the best lvl 4 agents are already in low sec?and they're nerfing loot in missions?go try to run some level 5s in low sec and see how long you last until you have to replace your ship and implants.
5/11/2010,"currently we can see alliances trying to build as many supercapitals as possible. the increased difficulty of killing a supercapital means that one day we may see all titan/supercarrier fleets. they will be the new battleship which is ridiculous considering ccp didn't think many would be built. shame ccp doesn't prove to have much foresight in their designs. this in turn will decrease the importance of carriers and dreadnoughts if everyone and their dog has a supercarrier and/or titan.i would like to know what ccp intends to do about it, if they intend to do anything at all that is. how can the new alliance compete with the old one?"
5/11/2010,do not expect anything from ccp to actually make 0.0 fun.instead adapt and build more super-caps then your opponents.
5/11/2010,thats the problem. indeed extend my complaint to all capital ships.
5/11/2010,with the buff of supercaps people are more willing to use them and stay on the field. that means you get more chances to kill them.no need to nerf them artificially again.
5/11/2010,you mean you get more chances to kill them if you have your own supercapital fleet to counter their supercapital fleet? and what about those folks who cannot afford supercapital fleets and any supercapitals are bought by alliances who can build them?what role are battleships relegated to?
5/11/2010,destroyers
5/11/2010,battleships will become the new drones.
5/11/2010,"if node don't crash ...yeah it's a party in h-w. 1600+ guys, and 400 guys wanted to come inside ...bs are new heavy brained drones ^^"
5/11/2010,"simple. bounties are crap, loot is crap, and i believe drone ai is an item with no use whatsover."
5/11/2010,simple. you dont know what you are talking about.
5/11/2010,"darius, it really helps to have a ****ing clue what you're talking about. let's go over it:- drone missions have no bounties- drone missions don't increase (or decrease!) standings- normal missions deliver enough minerals that normal mission bounty + normal mission loot > drone mission loot- drone missions require a marauder to make even half way reasonable isk/hrand to top it all off, drone missions are getting hammered by the nerf bat in a few days. -liang"
5/11/2010,"yes. yes .... everything has to be the same.just because of the tractor beam bonus? a decent salvager ship fit makes it obsolete. (think salvager cane)thats the only issue. but before we see the new final numbers of drops from drone missions, we cant really judge it no?"
5/11/2010,"i guess where i was coming from is this: most missions have rewards that are (at least somewhat) proportional to the difficulty or relative length of time to complete. the recipe consists of bounties, loot, and salvage. basically, the more things i kill and the harder they were to kill, the more isk i get. that formula is inconsistent in drone missions. and since most of them don't have an easy way to blitz, you almost have no choice but to decline and potentially take a hit to standings. that's all."
5/11/2010,"no, it doesn't have to be the same... but it'd help not to outright suck. congratulations, you just went from 75m isk/hr to 25m isk/hr. if you're coming back to a mission, for any reason, you are doing it wrong. go run the next mission, and you'll make more isk/hr. can you please learn a bit of how to play the game efficiently before you spout off?considering they're only getting worse.... -liang"
5/11/2010,"shameless selfbump,i do think this is a pretty important issue that the game would benefit greatly from if worked on.you will see ships that i listed that you have used for great effect and might think theres absolutely no need for it to be boosted - but please try to remember what actually made the ship and setup you used work: the ships design and role, or good skills both ingame and piloting which wouldve worked with any other ship int he same weightclass?take the deimos as example. it works and sure is good fun to fly, many good players have gotten alot of kills with it. the problem with the deimos however is that its role is skewed. its playing in a leagure that closerange battlecruiser and even battleships fill, the deimos has little chance to perform other then being a trophy *****, and as such is rarely seen.when debating about t1 frigates and cruisers its important to keep in mind that they are for a large part the only choice for new players, that dont have electronic and engineering lvl5. a new player can hardly make a t1 scanfrigate work for pvp, if the combat probelauncher with its 220 cpu alone uses up all the cpu. on top of that, to cater to new players that have been in the game for a month or three, it would go a long way if they can engage in interesting mini professions like probing/scouting. with simple bonuses like negating the cloakspeednerf and lockingnerf on the heron etc. you would create a role that despite these ships being ingame for so long is not viable yet.the goal should be to give t1 frigates and cruisers roles like their t2 counterparts, while still being vastly outperformed by them.ships that are simply due for some changes (in no particular order):- hel- magnate, heron, imicus, probe- crucifier, inquisitor, condor, atron, maulus, slasher, breacher- keres, hyena (mwd sig radius reduction for all eas plz)- retribution, enyo, hawk (retri would be fine with a rocket fix)- coercer- eris, flycatcher- augoror, omen, celestis, bellicose- lachesis, huginn- deimos, sacrilege- prophecy- eos, nighthawk- badgermki, iteron1-3, wreathe - procurer- cruor, succubus"
5/11/2010,"- hel: well im not a super cap pilot but (look at the lowsec powerhouse alliances, it would seem to them tham moms work just fine)- magnate, heron, imicus, probe: these ships are not ment for pvp they are support frigs, you scan down ur enemy and warp the"
5/11/2010,"you want to redo your research.retribution, rockets?you see plenty of the t1 prober hulls in empire. for lowsec/0.0 you really want to see the covops cloak."
5/11/2010,"they do, its just the hel needs proper bonus.coming from someone who has used the buzzard in gangs and fleets for years, there is just no way i could use the heron for even a minimum of the buzzards pvp mini-profession. its not just that the buzzard probes better, has more room for tackle, propulsion mods, tackle and tank - the problem is the heron, and the other races counterparts for that matter, just cant do it at all.the result is that new players are told to train for rifters, merlins etc. the idea to suggest a new member to try probing and scouting, which does require much individual skill rather then ingame sp, seems to be herecy for most. aside from the griffin, putting a pilot into a ew t1 frig is a wasted pilot - he is far more useful in rifter etc. same btw for the other frigs - the vigil and rifter outperform the breacher so far its not even funny. its impossible to run an mwd and warp disruptor ont he condor with maxed cap skills for over 40seconds, if youre using warp scramblers why not use a merlin with 10* the ehp and not much less speed.i could go on about each ship, but ask yourself - how many of the ones listed do you actually see used?they are incredibly rare in fleets, they die instantly because they are easy to hit compared to ceptors and have little tank compared to assault frigs. both bonuses are meh, but theyd be used if they werent such deathtraps.again, just look at killbaords, very few ppl fly them - for a reason.to be fair im not familiar with how effective destroyers are in fw fleets - what i find when playing with these is that fits looking effective to me require a very good pg/cpu skill lvl.indeed they are, problem is that the eris and flycatcher are hilariously bad compared to the sabre. the heretic doesnt compare either however its a good compromise and can be fitted for both large fleets (dual bubble, shield extenders mwd and speed) or small gangs. now youre somewhat right, they do work in their role to entrap other ships. but sabre pilots get to actually have fun shooting things and zippin around because their ship is properly designed - the other dictors are not."
5/11/2010,"the osprey and exequror are the logi ships. the augoror gets a cap transfer bonus that is never used, because its impossible to fit cpu and pg wise. the celestis and bellicose are ew ships, while the celestis just needs a boost to keep up with the blackbird the bellicose is just a waste of bandwith.the thorax fitted with lazers does everything better then the omen, just saying.the lachesis and hugin both have split weapon systems, and it shows. both are outperformed by their cloaking brothers.its a tough one, i think they both could do with a signature radious reduction - especially the deimos. both are playing against battlecruisers and bs - a boost to their cruiser attributes would help.it does nothing better then the harbinger, the proph gets a resistant bonus but has one less lowslot then the harbinger. instead of having two almost similar ships, giving the proph an heavy assault missile bonus would make things far more interesting dont you think.nighthawk works nicely in pve, but a commandship with bonuses to kill frigs?gimme a caldari absolution please.the sigil and bestower are the right approach - one fast and one big hauler pilots can choose from.why have 5 hauler models that become useless after a few hours of training?my bad, i meant the vengeance ;)"
5/11/2010,"some people kill dramiels with bellicoses.cant comment on the diemost, but the sacri can withstand quite some punishment in smallgang/solo work. its sigradius is just 10m larger than the t1 hull. and it gave up the laser cap usage bonus for its missile bonuses. what kind of bonus from the t1 hull do you miss?the missile bonus has been discussed before ... only t2 amarr ships use missiles (except or the inquisitor), but the prophecy follows the punisher->maller->prophecy->abaddon line.so either you make all those ships or leave the prophecy. there was some discussion around switching the cap usage bonus of the prophecy/maller/punisher into the dmg bonus of the abaddon. but the balancing there might be tricky as you would need to increase the base cap of those 3 ships without unbalancing them compared to the other races. (they could become strong cap war boats that way)<sarcasm>yes the nighthawk sucks in pvp.totally sucks</sarcasm>"
5/11/2010,"i don't agree with some of the ships and you totally forgot some weapon systems, but i am supporting this.also, remove tiers."

5/11/2010,delete walls of text as well.
5/11/2010,what exactly would this forum be for if we're not allowed to discuss something that is frequently discussed? also you forgot dust whines.
5/11/2010,"you seem v. upset. this proposal was not directed at you, though i find it terribly interesting that you think it was. a little self-doubt, perhaps?"
5/11/2010,"by macro whines, does that include the lolwhine u made about macro missioners? then add anti-suicide ganking whines and anti-mission whines to the list and i'll support it."
5/11/2010,and then the entire assembly hall shut down
5/11/2010,i'm not sure which is more sad.that you actually want to discuss any of the topics that i listed......or that you can't think of more things to talk about then what i listed.
5/11/2010,"so far rockets are not particularily worth very much.so, how about this to turn them into a more 'fun' (if not effective) tool.a mini 'bomb'what i'm suggesting is a mini area of effect weapon, very rapid firing, short but fast duration of flight, non-targetted, in direction that ship is going.obviously smaller aoe than bomb.intention, to be fitted to interceptors going in on full burn straffing runs on a ship, or group of ship.don't want to go into to too many details as this is just a conceptual proposal.give me some thumbs up :-)"
5/11/2010,you want thumbs up on an idea that is not fully developed?wouldnt features & ideas a better place for it?
5/11/2010,ammo = scripts.

5/11/2010,"add in ammo scripts too and i support because i like scripting and if you put scripts in my scripts i can script while i script.laser - taste the rainbow - ammo changes type continuallyhybrid - point blank - 100% dps increase, must be in physical contact with enemy to usemissiles - blue on blue - 200% dps increase, but missles fly off and hit random targetsprojectiles - one shot one kill - 300% dps increase, but destroys the gun that fires it"
5/11/2010,rofl i want that.
5/11/2010,simple as adding wormholes under operations and wormholes under location as options in the in game recruitment adverts.
5/11/2010,"why, it would appear you got your first major downtime already on the 7th. :)otherwise, no, of course. besides, if you need ccp to shut off the game for you because you apparently lack the self-control to abstain, then you really need help."
5/11/2010,"i have a better idea:let's all put the servers to an infinite downtime, do something else all the time and just send ccp our money for nothing."
5/11/2010,"i too appreciate using my recon to support another recon. support support is the best role in the game! i suppose you're also going to suggest that we fit lock time rsds on our arazus to support rooks? imo the question is whether you'd rather bring an arazu or a rapier when going after a nano ship.... and i would always choose the arazu. this is a problem when you consider that the minmatar recons have always been the traditional nano counter - and that they have lost that role due to their ""primary ewar"" being usurped.-liang"
5/11/2010,yes. eve was never a game that favored teamwork.
5/11/2010,"i'd rather have two arazus than one arazu and one rapier except in very specific circumstances. sometimes ""teamwork"" involves ""bring something else so you actually contribute"". -lianged: and in reality, i would much prefer to have a curse and an arazu. yay, the rapier is so awesome at stopping nano ships!"
5/11/2010,"combining the tp and web bonuses on my rapier allows my dread to hit an orbiting bs for almost full damage.the tp is a very situational tool on the rapier, but in the cases where it's useful, it's very useful.they are when you combine them with a small frigate class ship that can stay close under the guns and tackle, or an arazu that can disrupt from even further out.yes scrams slow it down more - but you can't stack scrams. if you add more scrams to an already scrammed ship, nothing happens. if you add more webs to an already webbed, or abing, ship, it slows down more. arazu scrams have half the range of a rapier web, and neuts are countered if the opponent has a cap booster or nos or any other way to quickly replenish cap and reactivate his speed mod. additionally, a neuted/scrammed ship is slower, but a still mwding, dual webbed ship has a huge sig and will be much easier to hit.recons are not really intended to be solo ships - they have ew bonuses, and ew is supposed to be a force multiplier. combine it with any kind of td, damp or ecm and it will be pretty safe at that range.i'd take the rapier. with it, i can slow it down to make it easier to catch up from 40km, and then properly tackle at 24k. with an arazu, i can't slow it don until i get in to 18k.i do agree that rapiers and huginns could use a role bonus of 25% web strength, making them 75% though, but they're still very good and very valueable ships right now. 1 rapier and 1 arazu to lock down a ship from their maximum ranges so a gang can come in and finish it is perfectly reasonable imo."
5/11/2010,they only take a few volleys to pop... oh wait
5/11/2010,"supported, because this would mean that i would have a chance to tackle even if my target has multiple wcs."

5/11/2010,"could you stop spamming me to vote for you in jita please, it's getting pretty annoying."
5/11/2010,"greetings,i'm rather new to the csm process and politics, so pardon me if i have not done full research on all the csm candidates and their past views and achievements, or separated all the facts from the multitude of opinions. my opinion below is based on my observations, and it is entirely possible that these may be disputed by facts.ankh has applied to join the ammatar free corps out of what i believe is her own desire to live the full range of corporation and alliance social experiences, and to make herself a more complete capsuleer. in spite of her numerous achievements in past csms, she has impressed me with her humility and dedication to our corp, by dutifully fulfilling the tedious maintenance of our poses for a long time. as she had been what is effectively our version of the general secretary of the united nations, it is a very humbling experience to see that she can carry out her tasks without ever complaining once.throughout her stay in the afc/cva, ankh has been closely observing the situation post-dominion, with the issues concerning nrds alliances, sovereignty mechanics, and even roleplaying styles and motivations. she has sought valuable feedback from fellow alliance members and i believe this will be taken into account in her feedback to the council and ccp. in her replies to our alliance members, i have not detected any strong pro-cva stance, merely her desire to listen to all perspectives, and to make herself a true representative for all capsuleers.and, although i am now ankh's ceo in-game, she is a giant in her own right. she has done more for the eve community than most of us can ever imagine ourselves doing. for someone who has the passion and concern to improve the game that we all love (or love to hate), and has the determination and will to run for the council again, she has my vote.i hope you will give her your support. good luck to all the candidates!"
5/11/2010,"nice propaganda piece, but there's evidence in this thread that directly contradicts a lot of what you've said."
5/11/2010,"indeed, on my main ( can't post on these forums because of lolrp restrictions ) i know a few of the members from this corp and they all say she's done f-all for corp until term limits were done away with and she realised she could stand again and wanted support."
5/11/2010,sorry but that so-called evidence has already been proven false most of the time. i rather believe a statement from her direct ceo than some professional mudflingers and trolls. her ceo has a credible reputation.
5/11/2010,"truth is, marlakh's sudden involvement and statement, with the classic examples of nepotism here and there, sounds more like a crusade that is getting more and more desperate to keep her campaign on life support after going from vegetative state to persistent vegetative state when it only begs for a painless death without any suffering.and as for you, it is apparent you would believe anything any one tells you to believe because it is so much simpler that way for you, isn't it?"
5/11/2010,"if i look at the past times she and the other take care people ran for csm, we saw the same smear on the campaign thread. all these people won the elections regardless. when on the csm, ankh, erik and z0d performed well, and time and again the whines and accusations from the griefing/ganking/0.0 crowd were proven false."
5/11/2010,"bolded the pertinent part. so you agree that in places she has misrepresented herself and/or the facts, yet you still think she's a great canditate. astounding."

5/11/2010,"i keep in game arguments in game. i dont abuse mentally disabled children or their parents in them. i'd cheerfully call someone an idiot for losing a ship as ankh seems to have done, and i'd definitely tell them to stfu if they *****ed about losing it and tried to blame anyone but themselves (actually i do this quite often). but i would leave the kid out of it.mind you, i very rarely have ""disputes"" in corp chat because i actually contribute to my corp, and also i dont think that i'm too awesome to need to log in to intel or even check local (while claiming that i know just plenty about pvp tyvm)"

5/11/2010,"exactly. hell, you should see our corp chat, from time to time you'd wonder why the hell any of us are still playing eve judging by all the *****ing we do. the ones with multiple accounts (including moi) do the most *****ing in general even"
5/11/2010,"how many of the trolls are running for a public position with social responsibilities? most people know where to draw the line when having a disagreement with someone, and what was said in that corp chat goes far and beyond anything that any rational human being would consider decent, regardless of how mad you are. what happens in csm meetings if she doesn't like what's being said?and it doesn't matter how many times you use the emoticon, what she has done is still indefensible."
5/11/2010,"a) if you say they've been snipped post the full logs, everyone gets a copyb) you should never be personally attacking anyones family members and actually be meaning it, especially if your highlighting a disability that one hasc) the fact you do not need to comment on the evidence here due to them being ""irrelevant and meaningless"" strengthens my impression that they are true as thats a very poor defencei hope your votes now circle the toilet and your never even considered for csm after this."

5/11/2010,"i'm really glad they made some changes with minerals and insurance, something that will affect a lot of issues, and i hope will make the game better in time. we had a very constructive discussion about it with ccp in winter, and i see a good results. as for the planetary interaction, i can't judge it yet, before i see the final result, not the unfinished singularity version of it. i really liked to play settlers back in 90th, and settlers like games after that, i hope we will get something similar and exciting at the end. the idea is great, all we need is a polished expansion.don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that everything ccp had ever made was bad, the eve is great, but my program is focused on the issues we have, not the achievements we are happy with."

5/11/2010,voted for mazz because she generates internet e-rage and is a girl.
5/11/2010,"with tyrannis on the dawn of release, how will the new features effect your campaign promises? would you think the expansion of game mechanics will change your stance on any of these things you have listed?specifically you say, ""fix old content before adding new features"" does this mean you oppose the new expansion with its planetary interface (pi)?"
5/11/2010,"and from a purely business perspective, anything you can do to make a potential competitor's business case a bit harder to make (eg: taking away their ""we can do a better interface"" bullet point) is a good idea. thanks for pointing that out."
5/11/2010,"well i managed to read through all the csm crap on the vote page. then came back to trebor. i like your ui and lag agenda. i have mailed my corp and will hopefully get it forwarded to alliance mail, as i do not have the rights... lol. i stated my character votes for you and linked the vote page and this post. i also do not hold the fact you are currently in initiative mercenaries against you! i know how hard it is to eak out a living with them. now i' am rambling again.+2 votes and good luck trebor"
5/11/2010,"you got my vote for wizardry! that was my first role-playing game i ever knew, back when i was a young lad watching my father play it on the apple ]["
5/11/2010,i like where you stand on low-sec and exploration (needs a big boost imo)got mah vote brah...
5/11/2010,the hell with the party line... mazz can't even see.elise '10
5/11/2010,"i'm pretty much ok with all that. with wtz, anyone doing anything substantial: roaming, hauling, missioning, what have you will already have bookmarks made so that awesome freighter you're trying to gank is still going to hit the gate and jump through.jump freighters: i know the common sentiment is that eve was much cooler when there were freighter conga lines errrverywhere, but ultimately this would be a bad thing in that it would just promote a blob mentality even further. not to mention that it would make nomadic living so much more difficult, and completely curb-stomp the hopes of a robust low-sec market.so while they are sometimes frustrating, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. i would like to remind everyone that voting is still open and i can still use your help! if you know anyone who is undecided or has yet to vote, or too cynical to vote, send them my way!"
5/11/2010,"confirming i do know the true identity of cat's main, will share this infomation for 500m isk, transfer through chribba's third party service.mail me"
5/11/2010,"if you were elected to csm what would be your primary goals or objectives? other canidates have complained of game balancing issues. do you agree that there are problems in game mechanics that need addressing? if so, what is your view on the new expansion coming out this month? do you feel that adding new features will detract from issues or help resolve them?"
5/11/2010,"if you have suspicions - petition them. let the gms decide. i'm fighting in tribute at the moment and have no idea, what other corp members are doing in delve. if i would see a player, who acts like a bot - i would petition it, corp member or not. so you are comparing miners, who took all possible precautions to mine in safety, with some carefree noobs, who think, that highsec is completely safe? don't you see, that there is something wrong in such comparison?imperialism even alliance wallets have tendency to deplete, and a difference between fat wallet and the thin one, is the difference between victory and defeat."
5/11/2010,last week i provided the interview for eve-tribune.com. you can read it here.
5/11/2010,"how do u think, corbeau, if lvl 4 missions will be moved to lowsec, how many highsec ranners will leave eve and how many will join pvp ? but there is no doubt, it should be nerfed...."
5/11/2010,"do i look like fortune-teller? some will leave, others will adapt and some will become pvpers. anyway, it's for the best overall."
5/11/2010,bump awesomevote wulfnor!
5/11/2010,hi teadazeis it possible to elaborate on the wormhole points in your manifestoi represent a block of votes that can be persuaded to vote for issues that pertain to wormhole space if said stuff currently irritate usyou seem to be one of the candidates that are taking the csm very seriously an not as some popularity contest.
5/11/2010,vuk lau +1
5/11/2010,great candidates! you have my vote.
5/11/2010,voting for you now!
5/11/2010,"wtf?? why am i the bad guy here? i asked and asked for clarification and i started out nicely. if ccp had answered in a prompt manner none of this would have happened. all ccp had to do was answer one simple question in a timely manner. now i have my answer, hershel is still a freaky deeky. no clue what the hell the muppet thing is/was about. jack i was messing with you. i knew you were a guy since you are running for a spot on the csm. to bad you aren't really female, the whole pain is pleasure thing is fun but i perfer boy with girl. still great name though. and lumy what does the op stand for? adingo i wasn't trolling i was trying to get a straight answer for a simple question. why am i the bad guy because a buch of small minded players attacked me for asking and i defended myself on a level the attacks started on and i figured the na sayers would understand.i even thanked him for finally answering and wished everyone the best of luck in the election. how is that a bad thing? first you ***** about my questions/posts as rude. and now you are *****ing because i conceded that i was at fault (well not really lets just call it a draw)and wished everyone luck? are you people that completly barking mad that you can't accept that i accepted ccp's statement at face value and i quit my quest? geeze you folks are unreal. damned if i do, damned if i don't?"
5/11/2010,"i believe you are being hounded because of your continually terrible post style (the one paragraph and poor punctuation thing), though you have improved since the start. really, that's the only thing that bugs me. it tends to be difficult to read, and people seem to care less if they have to work to understand a post.of course, there's also that ""gay"" comment, which may or may not have offended people.and then there was your criticism of others' posting grammar, when yours hasn't been much better.but these are just possibilities... i wouldn't know about anyone's personal feelings."
5/11/2010,"oh there's no ""may or may not have"" about it--it did. newsflash: queer people play eve. and rather than apologizing when called on it the op proceeded to start ranting about general westmoreland and doing the standard ""i'm not a bigot but here let me say something bigoted"" routine. now what westmoreland has to do with any of this is beyond me, but regardless, of right now, the op still has not stopped digging.allow me to give the op a modest piece of advice: you are not making friends, and you look like an idiot. your best bet right now is to disappear quietly off the forums, and not come back until you've learned how to post without looking like a total moron. hope this helps!ps: if ccp censors the word ""queer"" then they're as dumb as the op.edit: confirming that ccp is as dumb as the op. the censored word is a synonym for ""strange"" that is frequently used by sexual minorities as a way to avoid the crisis of the ever-expanding acronym. thus typically one hears about the ""queer community"" as opposed to the ""lgbt community"", and my undergraduate college did not have an lgbt resource center, but a queer resource center. granted it is also used and indeed originated as a slur, but i would say that today its primary meaning is more neutral."
5/11/2010,unintentionally hilarious
5/11/2010,"elf lord? can it be? my haven't you come a long way from being that noob i killed in arnon with rail guns on his punisher lmao.even if this post is a little fail i'm glad to see your still at it.back on topic my freind applied aswell and they never got his aplication either so yeah it was prob a glitch on ccp's end but hey.... there's always next year don't fly safe, fly deadly!"
5/11/2010,best troll ever.
5/11/2010,"sup so sensational,something definitely needs to be done to and for lowsec, both for the residents already there and to help stimulate some new arrivals. i personally have yet to come up with any concrete ideas, however rico minali's outlaw expansion idea comes straight to mind. his idea would enable players to create, manipulate and run the criminal underground with access to a lowsec only blackmarkets and manufacturing opportunities and although i don't agree with everything that has been written, i wholeheartedly support the outlaw expansions continuing development and hopefully its future implementation.on another note, i am completely against moving all missions to lowsec and although i think there should be some small quanities of 0.0sec ore in lowsec, i'd not condone any substantial amount being made accesable there.the following idea is not on my agenda but something that has been floating in my imagination for the last couple of days:some of my less concrete ideas involving lowsec would be to buff the lowsec npc ai to be more inline with wormhole npcs, with rats dropping lowsec only commodities required for some function in hisec along with the ability of the rats to call in a support fleet which would be of a size relevant to the gang attacking it. if these commodities' sale could be restricted to 0.4 sec and below (although not illegal to have on your person anywhere else) some profit could be restricted to these areas and it would force people to come to these areas to pick them up.. :)this change would be aimed at bringing more hisec gangs into lowsec and industrial types which of course would also increase the risk of pirating oppurtunities.-t'amber"
5/11/2010,can you try to get ccp to release more info on dust if you are elected? regular updates for that would be a welcome addition.
5/11/2010,"i'm behind this guy, and you should be too!"
5/11/2010,"voted for, and friendly bump."
5/11/2010,"hi oz,with the increase in suicide ganking of miners that comes in cycles now(hulkageddon, etc) i've been watching with interest as other csm's have discussed the topic... ideas have been bandied about including removing insurance if concord kills you.i'm wondering what your thoughts on the issue are?personally:i'm all for finding ways to get rid of afk script miners, so those of us who are actually piloting our hulk's and orca's can turn a better profit on our hours and hours of floating in space chatting in alliance. unfortunately most hulkageddon participants don't ever seem to do the work of finding out if their targets are actually afk, they just find an expensive target and blow it up, and walk away laughing with the insurance check and maybe some carebear tears.there are only so many things we pilots can do to tank a hulk/orca and still make it profitable to fly the things. the more you tank, the less money you make. but even with a balanced fit your no match for 4-6 destroyers/cruisers/bc's jumping on top of you ready to be concord'dooken'dif you remove insurance on all concord kills that doesn't help the noobie player who accidentally targets another players wreck and shoots it in some complex somewhere. even with the ""are you sure you want to do this, you idiot?"" warning... i've personally been that idiot and yes it would have sucked not to have had insurance pay out for my idiocy. so i don't know what the solution is, which is where your thoughts as our maybe future rep come in."
5/11/2010,one vote for you. you can thank to vote match.
5/11/2010,"then vote for the person that doesn't smear. it's not so much an issue with politics, it's with the voters. noise and smear is what most people respond to, that's why politicians use it to get elected. if voters didn't lap it up, then politics wouldn't use it. cure the cause, not the symptom. good luck curing the inherent stupidity of people though.discussion on real life politics are not allowed.applebabe"
5/11/2010,"i find it funny that most of the ""mudslinging"" is not by the candidates. well, unless they each have hundreds of alts..."
5/11/2010,"there's what, 53 candidates? so let's say you run a really awesome smear campaign and mudsling 43 of them completely out of the race, leaving 10 behind. well, the other 9 have been campaigning and you've just been smearing. so you'll still lose. negative campaigning is effective, but it's not enough. of course you need to stand for something. of course you need to promote yourself. even in the us, with a strongly two-party system(aka, one where reducing an opponent's votes is just as good as increasing your own), there's still plenty of positive campaigning. but people like complaining about attack ads anyways."
5/11/2010,"not all candidates have been mudslinging.other than that, what herschel said.-t'amber"
5/11/2010,"i haven't been doing any mud slinging. i do pay one kitten per vote. fresh or roasted, your choice..."
5/11/2010,"congratulations and welcome the world beyond your screen. you finally understood the concept of politics, politicians, votes, voters, mudslingers and so on everywhere. you're telling things that are known and discussed for decades since democracy was invented.want a medal now?"
5/11/2010,"you manage that part just fine, miss-ban-all-pirates-and-lets-make-eve-a-carebear-game"
5/11/2010,"what about when you're posting interactions directly with the candidate that show them as unstable, unsuitable and downright unsociable? i mean surely people ought to know who it is that wants to represent them?discussions on real life politics are not allowed.applebabe"
5/11/2010,"i atleast see the difference between you and me then.other than you i don't feel the need to accept politics and politicians needeng to be like that.and no, keep the medal, i wouldn't want you to part with one of your's, they don't suit me anyways."
5/11/2010,"doesn't matter whether you accept it or not, its there.some people don't accept the concept of gravity, doesn't change anything."
5/11/2010,gravity isn't something you can change by acceptance or rejecting.the way people respond towards eachother is merely a matter of choice.maybe you will see the difference one day.
5/11/2010,a turd in a punch bowl is still a turd in th epunch bowl. no matter how big the bowl or how samll the turd.
5/11/2010,"i know the difference. but expecting people to change their choice without a reason is just like expecting gravity to go away. foolishness.until there is a reason for the ""mudslinging"" in politics to go away (such as fines or somesuch) it will remain as a popular method of trying to win / make opponent lose."
5/11/2010,bumpage.
5/11/2010,while adding new space might seem the right way it does not tackle the issue but only delays it. one year down the line you will have the same problems we have now. 0.0 isnt crowded as it is currently and large alliances wont grow fast enough to make use of their vast space.
5/11/2010,"hey guys,over at massively.com, we've put together a great big community resource to help voters make their minds up. it's been linked on the eve facebook and the eve news on the main page:massively's eve online csm candidate roundupthe article begins by explaining the importance of the csm and picking the right candidate in what i consider to be very clear terms. it then has a full listing of all 49 candidates in the running with a short paragraph on each of their goals in the csm. next to each candidate is their picture and links to their campaign pages, forum threads, interviews and videos. all the info on them is there all in one place so you don't have to hunt around for details. candidates are divided into those that have participated in previous csm editions, new candidates that are running campaigns and the few relatively unknown pilots that didn't make much of an effort to run a campaign.this is intended to be a community resource for the voting season and i fully encourage you to point out any mistakes, additional information or relevant links (such as new interviews) you find. as long as you guys supply any new info that comes to light, i'll keep the article up to date as a comprehensive resource leading up to the voting's closing on may 19th. feel free also to submit new information, links and corrections via this thread. if you know someone that isn't motivated to vote, doesn't know who to vote for or thinks the csm is a waste of time, perhaps this article might change their mind.cheers :)"
5/11/2010,"read it: great summaries of the candidates, thanks for the 3rd party synopses, and for doing the research to compile all the links and such. valuable resource for voting, and nice touch with encouraging ones to vote.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
5/11/2010,anyone or anything that brings more exposure to the csm process is a good thing(tm). :d
5/11/2010,"thank you for you effort. it's quite nice summary. but i would like to point out, that i'm not only about reforms in high/low security space. i'm also about making eve more harsh and fixing various stuff as i explained in my csm topic.by the way, here is an interview with me."
5/11/2010,"nice summaries, well done."
5/11/2010,thanks for the help
5/11/2010,"i saw the article.it was good to see it posted in the headline news on the front page of this web site.i did see a few issues...the article heavily weights the csm members that have served in past csm. past experience is a great bonus but the article also places them first. information fatigue can set in by the time you get to the end of that list. people will naturally lean to the people with past experience and the placement of them fisrt in the article reinforces that. not that i have a better organizational method to suggest. several of the people in the ""new active campaigners"" are not so new. they have been candidates in previous elections. leading the article with the candidates that held a csm seat previously and dropping past campaigner's in a ""new"" category is a bit dismissive.most of the information can be seen just by looking at the official candidate list. that being said the article distills the candidates positions rather then subjecting the reader/voter to information overload. i just wish ccp did not have a region named genesis, the the original name i had for the ""incubator systems"". labeling the concept ""genesis systems"" makes for a better name but, would conflict with the genesis region in game. it would be like making new content and using a name like eve gate, which is already prat of the game and the back story... who would do such a silly thing.... in any case thanks for the effort. any exposure is good exposure and letting more people know about the csm, and it's candidates, is a good thing."
5/11/2010,in what context is my blurb meant lol also i decided to type some words into my campaign webpage x
5/11/2010,i thought it was in order of good looks x)nice work massive!-t'amber
5/11/2010,"this thread is nothing but inspiration, next year i am totally going to run for csm!!may the best troll win"
5/11/2010,"amen lolfor the first time? really? you don't read a lot here, do you?"
5/11/2010,10 interviews up this week!i've also recieved a couple past the deadline that we will still be running next week even though voting is likely to be over or very nearly over by the time the issue is released.thanks for your time to everyone interviewed.
5/11/2010,"i filled mine out yesterday, just didn't get round to posting it lol. will send tonight. better late than never maybex"
5/12/2010,bring back the flashy woooosh!
5/12/2010,want flashy!!!
5/12/2010,/signed
5/12/2010,"do you have any argument other than ""nuh uh""? or ""its goumindong""? anything other than your unsupported claim that balance will be the way you say?any change you make is going to have people whine. if you have fast and agile blaster boats people will whine. if you have slow and more damaging blaster boats, people will whine.the question is rather ""where do you have balance"" and you only have balance with the trichotomous system that we have where the blaster boats are able to catch targets. they will still be sub-optimal in a skirmish gang since they can't run away. they will still be sub-optimal in a big gang because they can't get dps on target instantly. but they will also not be obsolete solo/small gang where the ability to full tackle and get dps on a target is a valuable addition."
5/12/2010,"look, leave the high agility and good speed to minmatar ships, give the gal blaster ships a higher speed and greater inertia/lower agility. so blaster ships can out run anything but a nano, but they have a turning circle of a moon. making piloting skill key rather than just clicking ""keep at range"" or ""orbit at"".i really think straight line speed is key and looks like the balls to the wall, full frontal naked assault gal war fighting ideology seems to be.edit: terribad england"
5/12/2010,"high speed with low agility (i.e. high align times) isn't high speed.the advantage to minnie ships will still be that they are typically going to be shield tanked rather than armor tanked and that going into full tackle range necessitates a significantly higher amount of risk than a pilot that does not.in a comparison of a skirmish ship solo vs the blaster solo the blaster indeed will have the advantage(provided the minnie ship isn't using its utility highs wisely), they should. but once numbers start to increase, the ability to get tackles at close range starts to significantly diminish compared to the ability to focus fire. either the blaster ships have to tackle 1 by 1 in order to focus fire or they have to target ships one by one. the first means that they have to re-close to damage range on each target since the rest of the skirmish gang which is not tackled will be keeping range. giving up the ability to focus fire is the other option, and certainly not the stronger of the two.time and time again it has been shown that the ""burn towards a target"" is a recipe for disaster against longer ranged gangs that are able to take a majority of their gang outside of the range of the opponent. fast and agile blaster ships do not change that scenario, nor do they effectively change the scenario against a heavy gang of longer ranged ships that is sitting still (since the ""first mover advantage"" will still outweigh the raw damage advantage. there are also gang homogeneity issues) tears them up.it only changes the game when its a very small gang, where targets can be isolated and a follower will not be slaughtered before it can do effective damage. this is especially true since the only time that blaster ships can field an effective tank(to make them a heavy tackle that might have a chance of surviving in a gang scenario where they have to chase a skirmish gang)they will have to be running armor(not really enough slots for shield for the cruisers) and that means eating up low slots with plates and modules that aren't speed modules... eating away at any speed advantage they are given."
5/12/2010,"i support this, ccp needs to at least let us know if they agree there is a problem, so we can have an end to this ever recurring subject"
5/12/2010,"i see what you did there...anyone thought of ""charge mode?"""" we have triage module, should we have ""charge module"" that would make your speed go though the roof, but have a big reactivation delay?"
5/12/2010,"it is an interesting idea, but it would mess up pvp dynamics badly.people would us it to get past gate camps, usually charging back toward the gate for jump out. that tactic is already powerful with mwd. but at least mwd can be turned off by scramble. the webs are too weak to stop anything. such a module would become a must-have for all pvp.it may also lead to new bumping tactics, with unexpected results."
5/12/2010,"and this is the issue these threads keep reaching:blasters can't get a increase in damage because then they are op when they land on ships in a gank.blaster ships can't have more speed/agility because then minmatar ships don't have a speed/agility niche.blasters can't have more range because then ac (and?) pulse would lose their niche.railguns can't have more damage because then caldari railboats become op at long range and gallente become op at medium range.railguns can't have more range because even though this would fix gallente, it would render the bonuses on caldari ships worthless.hybrids in general cannot have more tracking because that would allow op fits - blaster bs that kill tacklers and mid-range rail bs/hacs that can kill tacklers.hybrids (railguns) cannot have penetration as this would make even low damage guns op in certain situations.so, currently, hybrids remain without a functional niche because there are so many different problems with them that blanket changes will not fix the problem without making something op. a proper fix would be tl;dr, but csm isn't willing to go to ccp with a general suggestion for ccp to fix hybrids.does assembly hall have to debate balancing changes for each hybrid ship/gun/ammo? there was already a consensus that hybrids need to be reviewed and balanced. isn't the actual job of balancing the responsibility of ccp, not assembly hall or csm? can't csm simply tell ccp that hybrids need to be reviewed for balance and leave it in the hands of ccp (with oversight and input - usually given when things hit sisi)?"
5/12/2010,"this is what i wrote pages ago , hybrid ships/weapons need to be redesigned and csm only needs to push the issue to ccp . it is ccp job to fix this."
5/12/2010,"i fail to see this as a valid point. anyone care to enlighten me?i have seen many gank squads in my time, and i have not noticed any emphasis on blasters. even if you ignore all the practical hurdles of getting perfect blaster damage, it's still only marginally better than acs and lasers after ship bonuses. and a damage mod makes more difference in ship dps than weapon type.very few ""practical"" gallente ships utilize 3 damage mods (for short range), because that would leave them with very weak tanks. but likewise, all other factions can achieve same type of dps with 3 damage mods on short range weapons. and actual dps of theirs will match that of blasters when you factor in fall off and tracking.so no, i just don't see any significant differences in practical or theoretical damage output of blasters relative to other ships."
5/12/2010,"you are talking about the current situation. the statement is referring to blasters that did more damage than they currently do. already, when a blaster boat warps to you at 0 (or near 0), they melt your face. if ccp boosted their damage output, there would be giant emo tears and op outrage. even a 1% boost to damage would cause this because people talk hypothetical situations on here while disregarding the normal state of affairs (look at all the ""not support"" posts in this thread).again, i think the case has been made repeatedly that ccp needs to address hybrid guns and make adjustments to fix the imbalance."
5/12/2010,"yes. the assembly hall is not where you go to whine to ccp with no suggestions. its a place where you can articulate exactly what is wrong and exactly how it can be fixed and exactly why this is so.why? whines waste ccp's time. without clear articulation on what is wrong, why its wrong, how it can be fixed and why ccp has to justify all of the missing points before they can act. if they end up doing it in a way that was contrary to the point of the thread? well then its back to square one with more whines.speed and agility are not ""niches"". minmatar are the skirmish race and that niche is maintained even if blaster boats are faster and more agile than the skirmish ships for all the reasons already outlined.if you have two ships. one that has long range and is slow, and one that has medium range and higher damage but is fast. a third ship that is short range must be faster than the medium range ship or it will be obsolete. the medium range ships can kill the longer ranged ships in small gangs. the long range ships can kill the medium and short in larger gangs. the short range ships can kill the long range ships in small gangs...except that if you have the option of flying a ship that can destroy the long range ships in small gangs and loses to the medium range ships in small gangs, or a ship that can destroy the long range ships in small gangs and ties the medium range ships in small gangs you're always going to choose the medium range ships.no, they can't get a damage increase because a damage increase is both a range increase(effective dps @ range goes up over falloff, increasing the distance required by minmatar before they have a damage advantage) which is a no-no, and won't do anything to alleviate the problem of minnie ships obsoleting them in combat except as a function of the range increase."
5/12/2010,"disagree all you want, it won't change the fact that it cannot be balanced. also the way it would be balanced would always favor buffer tanks, since balanced against repair tanks would make it too weak against buffer(and too strong against stronger repair tanks)"
5/12/2010,"i've been messing around with this idea trying to simulate a fight, a 1 vs 1 fight mind, with this mechanic. i've chosen a brutix with a dual medium armour repair fit as my target.strangely, because it is a dynamic chance based system dependent on the current state of the tank (shield/armour) the active tanker prevents a lot of the penetrating hits by keeping their tank as close to 100% as possible. which, vs railguns of a ship in the same class, isn't difficult. my simulation could be completly wrong but i've tried my bestest (may bad england a bit there) to create a fair simulation. i'll do a couple other simulations too but from what i can see, the most vulnerable to a penetration mechanic appears to be the ""passive shield"" tanker. seems as peak recharge rates don't occur until shield = <25%i'll keep working on it, alone, mostly cause i'm bored, whilst being called an idiot on the forums until i can see a really big problem with it."
5/12/2010,"everything else aside, what the f$#@? are players and csm the balance team for ccp!? is csm really suppoused to do all the balancing and ccp decides if they go with it or not? what, where, why, how... i don't get it."
5/12/2010,all the cool kids would be hull tanking. don't forget that the difference between someone with a dcu and someone without is huge for damaging hull.also...this. does anyone here disagree with the statement that railguns are not well balanced with the other long range guns? i mean everyone here seems to have offered a suggested fix so far.
5/12/2010,railguns are balanced with the other long range guns
5/12/2010,"no, they are not."
5/12/2010,"no, they are not. beams have dps, artillery has alfa, caldari rails have range - gallente rails have no advantage."
5/12/2010,i already showed you how to have this problem show up. you have two options to maximize your chances of damage penetration:- ungroup your railguns (each gun then has a progressively higher chance of penetration)- use more than one rail ship. even two will have a much higher chance of penetration than any other.i agree with your analysis that passive recharge tanking would be the most vulnerable - especially considering that your tank barely even start working at 50% shields.-liang
5/12/2010,i agree with basically everything said as i have experienced that these ships need a little loving so a t1 version doesn't do the same or better
5/12/2010,yes please. supported
5/12/2010,<---- i live in wh space and this is a big issue and all it does is cause everybody to need multiple t3 ships to do anything with them. so i fully support this fix or anything that allows assembly and refitting of sub systems in space.
5/12/2010,"supported ccp please give this some priority, we under stand that things are bussey there, but this isue has been on going for a while now and it seems that nothing is being done about it. i also would like to see scroling out having no effect on sounds, where it pertains to my ship, hearing guns going off or other sounds is part of the experience, dont make proximity to your ship in the view a perameter for sounds. maybe a few more options also, one i can think of is the shield, armor and hull warnings, i like those but can they be put on a seperate slider each, or at least combine all three on there own slider, turn them down so there not blaring, then you barly here some other stuff as there part of the ""world sound level"" slider (least i think thats the one), put them on there own slider. so come on ccp, it's time to give us working sound don't ya think."

5/12/2010,"hey all,i apologise if this has already been put forward however i would love the training skill time to be increased from 24 hours to 48 hours or maybe even 60 hours.my thinking behind this is as you progress your skills, the training time increases to the point where you can only stack 1 skill at a time.this becomes a pain when you are away for a few days and have no access to eve so you have wasted training time.i am sure people who travel a lot or who do not have access to eve for days at a time often can find this frustrating as you can occur weeks of wasted training time.if this idea has been put forward before and shot down then once again i apologise."
5/12/2010,"why not a week? for many players the ability to stack more than 1 skill at a time would require a month plus of training queue.it is all about scheduling your training queue. 24 hours is plenty, as the rational complaint was in regards to having to wake up at 4am to change skill training. there are always plenty of good skills to train to tide you over for a few days if you plan your training right."
5/12/2010,"the extra 24 hours would be enough to prevent ""morning wake-ups"" for skill training. anything more would allow people to skill up without ever opening the client for days on end, which is not right.edit:reply and support you're own thread too :)so i agree with this. ignore the guy above, he trolls every thread, probably has his five-minute response delay timer up 99% of the time.don't apologize to trolls either in your original proposal."
5/12/2010,"oh look. ""he doesnt agree with my super duper proposal. he must be trolling! because everyone with the right mind would just hit support on my idea"".dont want to burst your bubble, but not everyone who disagrees with you is trolling you.on the topic of this thread:the skill queue should solve exactly one problem: no more alarm clocking for changing skill training. it does that pretty well and gives you room to shuffle skills around so you get over the night. we dont need longer queues. if you had invested a bit time in searching, you would have found out that this is the general answer you get on this suggestion."
5/12/2010,"telling you that you are wrong is not trolling. i dignified your post with a response and explanation, which i probably shouldn't have. i did not say anything outrageous, try to derail the topic, or degrade you (unlike you have just done).as to having an extra 24 hours to prevent ""morning wake-ups"" - this would only be the case if you sleep more than 24 hours at a time."
5/12/2010,so you only wake up once every 48 hours? imo 24 hours is more then enough cause otherwise i want a 1 month que cause i sometimes almost forget that my 30 day skill is ending and i'm missing training time cause of that
5/12/2010,"electronic attack frigates cost 15x-20x times more then a usual t1 frig, they need special skill training and they are very nice to fly if is locking range was not reduced to crazy distances!!!hyena: 35ksentinel: 36.5kkeres: 39.2kkitsune: 42kthese are ships that are paper thin and the only tank they have is distance and speed! when some of their t1 mates do almost the same thing, costing 20x less and having the double of locking range, why fly them?give some loving to eaf and increase their locking range, please!edit: kitsune lock range error. thanks darius mclever"
5/12/2010,they don't call you naga for nothing eh?but still good point
5/12/2010,"this is the general problem of ewar ships. they have no tank, can easily be op with the wrong boosts, and cost too much for people to buy them for niche they are supposed to fill as they are currently.decreasing the cost (or fixing insurance) might be the correct fix though, not increasing the range."
5/12/2010,i dont want to nitpick ... but your numbers are a bit off. the kitsune has 42km base locking range (52.5 with lvl5 skills).
5/12/2010,"that 'almost' is pretty damn significant as it adds a ton of power in the form of the secondary bonuses.provided all t2 frigates get the insurance bump that has been promised for interceptors, price of flying them should drop to fittings and not much else, lets just hope that ccp includes them op does have a point regarding the range though, rather silly that they are so inferior to the t1 versions in the lock-range department .. not as if they will be using the secondary at those ranges so one might as well use t1 hulls (which is exactly what is happening in my experience)."

5/12/2010,"bounty-hunting is a pretty important aspect of this genre and one of the features touted to reel in new players. i'm not sure if it's just omitted now by ccp, but i keep seeing newbs in rookie help asking how the bounty system works. the heartbreak that follows is pretty formulaic -- bounties are useless now, they're only really used as trophies, people just get their buddies to collect/split them. i'm proposing a change that requires little development but a bit of planning to implement properly. the basic tenets are:1. only npc's can collect bounties. by placing a bounty on another player's head, it's an isk sink, meant only to aggravate that player.2. npc's are randomly generated to attack the bountied target. the frequency of ""bounty-hunters"" generated, as well as the intensity of their attack (one frigate? numerous frigates? cruiser/bc/bs?) are based on the system security level and the amount of the bounty. let's work some theoretical examples here. i place a very small bounty on a guy that keeps can-flipping me in a 0.3 system, but who i can't be bothered to attack. in low-sec space, there is less risk for an npc bounty hunter, so the odds of him being attacked are higher. since i placed a small bounty, when npc's are generated, they'll likely just be annoying frigs. if i pay more money, we might see bigger ships, or more frequent attacks when the target moves to high sec.now, that's a radical idea. we need to consider the details -- how often are we generating npc's? when/where would players be vulnerable to these attacks? in belts? at gates? while docking/undocking from stations?we also need to consider the implications. first, it makes space less safe in general. i rarely autopilot, but i'd never want to do it even in high-sec if i knew an npc could come suicide me for bounty. second, it may encourage further carebearing. rather than fighting your own battles, you're just hiring an npc. finally, it acts as an isk sink...which i think we can all agree is necessary.thoughts?"
5/12/2010,"i know there is already a ton of discussion on hybrid weapon balances, and although i do not necessarily have many complaints about blasters, i do think railguns (and consequently rail boats) need some lovin'. i also apologize if this has already been proposed, i did run a light search and didn't find anything specific to the deimos.without going into too much detail, i think the 10% per hac level to falloff range is just ridiculous. change it to something more appropriate for it's role(s), a bonus to tracking speed like the megathron would be nice and would help it compete with the other hac's better. blaster-fit deimos don't need the extra falloff, and sniper-fit deimos get an additional 15km or so they can play with, whoop-dee-doo. i would gladly trade 15km of falloff for the ability to actually hit something as a sniper, and it would help blaster-fits in close quarters to be able to hit targets in tight orbits like you should be able to do as a blaster-boat. it doesn't even have to be a straight across 10% bonus to tracking, even scaled down to say 7.5% per level would be appropriate i think.zealot = good overall sniper, good dps, good tracking, good rangecerb = good dps (once it gets there), amazing range possibilities, selectable damage type (although kinetic has a bonus)muninn = alpha is amazing, selectable damage type(current) deimos = uh.... it does everything that the above do except the dps is crap and the target either has to be flying directly at you or be motionless?(proposed) deimos = it may not have the best dps or range (possibly changed with railgun buffs?), but by golly it can hit just about anything except really fast ships reliably.ideas, thoughts?"
5/12/2010,"yes, everyone knows the deimost needs looking at. i like the proposed tracking boost, its true to it's the short range nature and sets it apart from the other hacs except maybe the muninn. but then i still think it could additionally use a slight boost to survivability..."
5/12/2010,"even if blasters get fixed (more tracking, more damage), the deimos still needs something to set it apart from the brutix and your idea does it (i dont think it's enough, but it's a good start)."
5/12/2010,"i like your idea. i think ccp wanted deimos to be an excellent close range face melter. just like its little brother thorax, except much better. this is why the current bonus to falloff range is pretty useless.i think tracking or dps(rate of fire) bonus would make deimos a nicer hac and put it in line with the other hacs."
5/12/2010,"edit: this thread was initially titled ""abnormal neutrino field dispersion analyzer probes."" the original text now appears at the bottom in quotes. the thread was initially anti-cloaking. however, i have renounced support of my own thread by reading the arguments provided to me by a previous thread on the subject. in fact, since i am a covert-ops pilot, i am now in support of enhancing one aspect of covert-op ships. this proposal will aid in traveling through impassable gates.covert-op ships improvement: covert-op cloaking device script: will now appear an additional 75 kilometers from the center of the gate after jumping and reduces alignment time by 33%. also allows you to use a gate within 75km but takes 4 seconds for the gate to transport you (can be reduced with skills to 2.5 seconds).second script. appear 45km from gate, but reduces alignment time by 66%. allows you to use a gate within 45km, but takes 1.25 seconds to transport you (can be reduced with skills to .75 seconds)both scripts will always place you at least 5km outside any bubble. both will allow you to use any gate within 5km of any bubble. this would obsolete mass bubbling."
5/12/2010,remove local
5/12/2010,"by the way,i put the in-game effects of my proposal so late in the text to repel the trolls with little attention span. plus it draws you in!"
5/12/2010,how would removing local increase/decrease the effectiveness of the scan? either that or you replied to the wrong thread (given there's a 3 in 4 chance of clicking on a removal local thread).
5/12/2010,dont fix what aint broken.
5/12/2010,"given that this method wouldn't be truly effective until you hit the 28-29 minute timer, that 27+ minutes should be more than enough time to collect all the information you need. if that isn't enough time you suck and shouldn't be flying covert ops anyway. everything needs a counter in this game. the method i proposed is a weak counter."
5/12/2010,and that helps how much with sustained engagements like we see them in the north atm?where covops basically have to monitor a system all day to give intel to the fc?
5/12/2010,"if you read the full description, if the covert-op ship leaves the system and comes back, the scanner is reset.thus as long as you leave the system and come back every 20-25 minutes, this counter will not work, although it provides the smallest chance of catching you at the gate.it's also a two-way road, not only are your intel gathering abilities slightly hindered, but so are the enemies. everything needs a counter, even if the counter is weak. again this is a weak counter.this would carve a special place for intelligent covert-ops pilots as well. maybe you'd even get a salary/payout from your corp!"
5/12/2010,"rofl! :)2 things:1. you know how badly bubbled those systems are up there?:)2. every probable cloak is not a weak nerf it is a strong nerf.if you had searched the forums a bit, you would have found all the discussions about it.just to give you an example. i have my cloak detection probes above the gate. you jump into our 10 large bubbles. try to cloak. i hit scan and burn into your direction. drone swarm around me decloaks you. dead.you won eve?"
5/12/2010,"apparently you didn't read that the scan requires 3 minutes before it even takes effect? you did however bring an important issue to date, so i'll state it here.cloaking improvement: ship is no longer revealed upon enemy ship coming close to you.this would require smartbomb usage to decloak you. again this is only a nerf for the stupid pilots. you are however showing the strong bias of being a covert ops pilot. stop being so blind. all nerfs appear equally damaging to certain people in all areas, this one happens to affect you.i've also read my threads on this topic, all of the past ""counters"" proposed so far are too powerful. did i mention i'm a covert ops pilot?"
5/12/2010,1month old covert ops pilot?
5/12/2010,"i will give you credit for presenting your idea is a well worded proposal that shows you obviously spent at least some time thinking about the matter.the issue is that cloaking really isn't a problem, and therefore doesn't require a solution, no matter how well worded it might be."
5/12/2010,"you do realise that the changes to the neutrino flux resulting from measuring these abnormalities will completely disrupt the neutrino-based communication systems that produce the local channel, right?"
5/12/2010,"now since you flamed me politely, i'll address the local as well.get rid of local in null-sec!allow sovereign systems owners to keep ""gate logs"" up to 12 hours recording what type of ship came through the gate and at what time. if the ship is from a friendly, let the pilot's name be displayed in the log. if a neutral/enemy ship passed through the gate, let the log simply show ""unidentified"" next to pilot name.i love these ""removing local would create 10000 more problems than it removes"" arguments. name those problems please.let's pretend local never existed and ccp said, ""hey guys we're going to make a chat channel that instantly provides you with the info of who is in your system at all times."" there would have been outrage. if you want info, go collect it in the ship it is made for (covert). removing local would be a buff to covert pilots, which i support. by the way, the first people to show outrage would have been covert-op pilots.on top of that i wouldn't mind a cat and mouse game to find covert ships. except the smart mouse could never be caught even with the proposal i gave above.risk vs reward.sun tzu said that information is the most valuable commodity. thus the reward for collecting intel is very high, thus the risk should at least be moderate to collect it.in short, both local and covert-ops (without risk) is for carebears. oh you don't like to hear that!?also, did you ever stop to think that a rotation of two to three covert op ships would be able to evade to this counter completely?fly safe.o/"
5/12/2010,"i want to address this a second time. in the reply above, i said ""a rotation of two to three covert-op ships would be enough to evade this proposal."" if you read the description it says ""scan is reset against enemy ship when it leaves the system."" perhaps you should have thought why i put that there?what i need to see now is an identifiable problem with my proposal. if you have a complaint, articulate what the problem is, not just ""i don't like it."" yeah of course covert-op pilots don't like it."
5/12/2010,i chuckled.
5/12/2010,"i love this idea! i have no objections yet. has a good story behind it too. that immobilization effect might be too overpowered though, maybe it should target jam the enemy ship instead."
5/12/2010,uhm .... you clearly havent been in any larger fight in 0.0.jumping in/out with a covops is suicide ... i think we would end up with covops alts being cycled with relogging. exactly what you want.
5/12/2010,"then let's add the following fix for both of these.covert-op ships improvement: covert-op cloaking device script: will now appear an additional 75 kilometers from the center of the gate after jumping and reduces alignment time by 33%. also allows you to use a gate within 75km but takes 4 seconds for the gate to transport you (can be reduced with skills to 2.5 seconds).second script. appear 45km from gate, but reduces alignment time by 66%. allows you to use a gate within 45km, but takes 1.25 seconds to transport you (can be reduced with skills to .75 seconds)both scripts will always place you at least 5km outside any bubble. both will allow you to use any gate within 5km of any bubble. this would severely reduce the effect of mass bubbling in fact it would make a single large bubble the most effective and efficient.for handling alt logging rotation, make the scan become stronger on the location of the ship, even if logged out.i invite you you to keep poking problems in the idea though, we'll keep making it better as a team. i've been in plenty of large fights, and it angers me that terrible/carebear pilots can be the most effective and instrumental pilots in the game (because there is no risk)."
5/12/2010,you do a pretty good job fixing the imbalances when they're mentioned.the idea of cloaking device scripts (covert ops only) is superb.this thread has evolved to benefit covert ops pilots more than it harms them.thumbs up!
5/12/2010,"let's rewind and start the problem analysis over again. you skipped to the solution, assuming everyone agrees with your absent problem analysis. you have to start with what the problem is, if not the symptoms of the problem. most people seem to disagree with you that a problem exists that needs a solution."
5/12/2010,"starting from the problem.information is 99% of the battle, and you obtain it 100% risk-free.this proposal is a weak counter, and as the guy said above me, this proposal (with the covert op scripts) now makes it easier to enter and leave hostile system, thus this proposal is now more advantageous to covert op pilots.good day."
5/12/2010,"as opposed to a t3 bubble ignoring ship? or a 10 km/s dramiel? or sitting at a pos near a gate with a scanner? or shuttle alts? or local chat? or? or? or?if the problem is near risk-free information (because cloaks are not risk-free), there are a ton of different things that need to be changed."
5/12/2010,"thank you for putting your foot in your mouth. since you recognize that there are lots of risk-free activities you should start making some proposals to fix them.and of the four people that responded, two of them support, two of them do not. count me vote and it's 3-2 in favor of the proposal so far."
5/12/2010,make it 4-2 supportsounds fun.edit--> forgot to support lol
5/12/2010,"risk mitigation is a major part of the game (any game, in fact, that boasts unique play styles). it is why people put tanks on their ships. it is why warp stabs exist. it is why eccm exists. it is why most people fit mwds on their bs. in fact, it is a huge part of the reason why people like cynos/bridges/cap ships. without risk mitigation of various kinds, all ships and tactics would end up being pretty uniform.without risk mitigation, bigger is always better and more numbers will always win. risk mitigation is integral to breaking up blob warfare to a certain degree and to the game in general.what damage is done by a cloaked ship that can't be countered already?as to the idea that 5 people responding in your thread is an accurate poll of the sentiments of the player population at large, it is a fallacy. assembly hall usually is not an accurate poll of the player population, let alone a thread few people have bothered to respond in. most people read the title of a thread asking for a nerf to cloaks and ignore it in hopes that it will drop off the first page and the poster will get the hint."
5/12/2010,"the assembly hall is where changes come from, read the description provided by ccp.i know that most people read the title, hence why i ""cloaked"" my title.as much as this game is about risk-mitigation, it is not about risk-immunity, especially for gathering the most precious resource/commodity, which is information.the next time i will not respond to you unless you point out a specific error in this proposal as it currently stands. also, you'd notice that i made it easier for cloaked ships to enter/leave systems with the lastest change to my proposal (covert op scripts).stop running form thread to thread without giving significant input."
5/12/2010,"cloaked ships are all but immune when they want to do anything harmful to you. they are usually pretty weak tank wise and can be killed easily when the opponent is prepared.sad fact is ... most people in the game are not prepared.but i am not going to repeat all the discussions again. the ""nerf cloaks"" topic comes up like every week. your idea is neither new nor original either.so instead of trying to nerf working game mechanics ... try to think of a way to use current game mechanics to counter them. there are plenty ways to handle cloaker. then we wont need an even more complex mechanic (and all your exceptions for covops make it more complex everytime you iterate over to adapt your proposal). last but not least ... as bagehi said ... presenting a solution starts with discussing the issue and the implications. but i guess you left that out as you would have been proven wrong pretty quickly.i suggest you start reading this thread. it discussed many many possible nerfs to cloaks and why they would break cloaks to uselessness."
5/12/2010,not supported! the pirate ships are enough balanced and lots of work was put down to balance them.the dramiel are one of my favourite frigates and it need quite some brains to know how to use it. it<U+FFFD>s made out of thin foil and dies pretty easy. you need to know what to engage and what to avoid...
5/12/2010,i think your comment made him upset and pull back the proposal :d
5/12/2010,i think the dram is just fine the way it is ^_^
5/12/2010,"wow, again sir, worst pilot in history"
5/12/2010,"this just seems to make eve more twitchy. you said you would rather have to keep relocking all your targets 5 times in ten seconds than the current ecm of just knowing your jammed? personally, i can't imagine more annoying game play than what you describe.i'm assuming you would lose all your locks and not just the current one - or this module would really be useless. if you intend to simply weaken ecm why disguise it behind this? it seems that most people who are in favor of this just really dislike ecm. but if you nerf ecm you ruin any chance that caldari can be effective in pvp. (other than the drake and merlin) you know people don't train caldari cruiser 5 so that they can fly a mean moa or eagle. so if your intent is to nerf ecm you should also start thinking about how you might buff caldari or nerf every other race. in eve the races are decently balanced right now (minmatar is the fotm though interestingly they generally are weakest agains ecm) and the caldaris best thing to bring to the table is ecm."
5/12/2010,"poor falcons/rooks. nothing quite like owning a 150m isk ship that is primary target, has no tank, has no insurance, and everyone wants nerfed to uselessness."
5/12/2010,i am intrigued by this. it would still make ecm effective. it would level the ewar playing field. it would not make the person with the jam on them feel left out of the fight.i think it would have to be expanded to cover high slot modules in general. neuts would not be effected nor would logistics's if it only weapons. i see a major coding problem here. on the flip side it would balance ecm much better then any other alternative i have seen so far.nice one java.
5/12/2010,no i don't support your proposal. i do agree with you that low sec does need some care.now what do you think a level 4 mission runner would do if this really did happen? i will tell you right now that he would frown and think to himself damn im going to have to spend longer running missions today!that is all you would accomplish. i would like to continue on this theme and remind you that running level 4s in high sec is an income source for both low sec and high sec pvp. if you increased the rewards for high sec mission runners you might actually help promote activity in low and null sec since many pvpers use their high sec income to fund their activities.
5/12/2010,"nerfing or granting entitlements is a flawed approach. you just spend most of your time fighting some fixed social belief system that drugs, therapy or the witnessing of the economic collapse of an entitlement state (they invented everything) cannot cure. fundamental problem is the attempt to try and change players social mind set, that do not want to become any part of the social environment of eve. they came to this game with some sort of assumption that being a sandbox type of game, they can establish some solitary island and have no compunction of engaging in activities that is described on the box. cool they created their own niche, and make great pinatas.creating opportunity for players is what promotes activity. this draws the players who want to go into lo-sec / null sec and take that risk. what might be a solution for lo sec, would to allow some sort of ownership. this can be something they can build and fight for. this will bring out the players who accept the game for what it is, and entice them to carve out something for themselves and their mates. tldr;quit trying to change and goat the players that have no inclination of ever playing a game that will require some sort of effort and or risk. improve lo sec / null sec for the population that will take that chance."
5/12/2010,"your proposal won't bring mission runners to lowsec, it will just make some of them rage and quit eve, the other ones will just keep running missions, even if they make slightly less money.risk averse people can't be fixed.lowsec needs something unique, profitable and attractive.read elise randolph's thread in crime & punishment for a list of great ideas."
5/12/2010,"maybe you need to do a bit more thinking instead?1) 0.0 has been buffed in most of eve expansions and the percentage of people there has been constant for years. 2) there are already great level 4 and all level 5 agents in low sec but running mission in a ship build to survive pirate attacks is so much slower that there is no interest in running missions there. so long as:a) npc continue to attack only the mission runner leaving the pirate alone;b) there are tons of npc so missions are long;c) scanning is easy and probes can used in a way that allow the prober to have the within directional scan range of the mission runners for only a few seconds,running missions in low sec will be a stupid thing to do.it is better to run missions in npc 0.0.3) lp reward in low sec are almost x2 the lp reward of high sec for an equivalent agent. that is about a 20-30% pay increase. much more for fw. your idea will not change much there.4) the only reason why running missions in low sec will reduce mineral production is because very few people will be looting and salvaging them. so, to do a short version: your idea will **** off a few players but it will have no other effect. not even getting someone to ragequit."
5/12/2010,"well - that's a pretty decent assumption to make (i.e. that all lvl 4 mission runners are anti-social) - but when you consider that very many of them are alts of 0.0 or low-sec dwellers, and/or members of hi-sec corporations, your assumption is patently false.as for ""effort""? some people play this as a ""game"" and aren't really interested in too much effort in their game...pvp/sovereignty wars/piracy - those are the things that draw people (now) to low-sec / 0.0. there are other draws, but those (imho) are the main draws. those activities have nothing in common with mission running, and so, have no appeal to those whose sole activity in eve is mission running.you could move all lvl 4 missions to low-sec, and you won't get a sudden surge of people to lowsec - all you will get is people setting up bc's to speed run lvl 3's...ccp is taking steps to reduce reprocessed mission goo (read meta -0- items) in an effort to buff miners utility, so that's a non-issue.tl;dr?missioners (who don't do anything but mission) won't go where the game-play isn't attractive to them & pvp isn't attractive to the average risk averse missioner.:thumbs down: (again...)"
5/12/2010,"if you want more activity in low sec, make a way for anyone in high sec to join some organization that they can group up and clean out anyone with a neg security status with no security loss themselves. like a zero tolerance on piracy initiative. additionally it would be something you could join like a mission rather than having to leave your current corp. that would allow some more activity in low sec, especially if after so many kills the security of the system were to slowly raise or go down based upon which side of the equation had more kills or % of kills that week/month."
5/12/2010,"this will not provide you with the piles of marauders and ravens to kill that you are probably hoping for. low sec mission hubs would not exist in the way you are thinking. what you would get is the 0.0 alliances would control lvl 4 low sec mission hubs and low sec pirates would be wtfpwned if they tried to mess with the alts that are grinding through missions to fuel wars.it would create an even larger barrier for income potential between the little guys and the big alliances than already exists. it would also move the blob warfare of 0.0 into low sec. somehow, i don't think you want to do that.low sec needs a revision that boosts the current play style of low sec without nerfing other people's play style. benefits to having -10 for instance."
5/12/2010,"nope, i never eluded to ""lvl 4 mission runners"" nor did i call them anti-social. you read into my post, and came to your own conclusion. i basically said that ""they"" just do not want to be involved with the current social events in eve. and to do that would mean expending effort, and they would rather just do whatever it is they do, and keep to themselves.i am just pointing out that trying to coax these guys out of high sec is a waste of time. but making lo-sec appealing to the ones that would like a little more reason to venture out might be something to look at."
5/12/2010,truth.
5/12/2010,"problems:eve needs more isk sinks.0.01 isk warring is inappropriate content removed.applebabe proposal:when changing any market order, you are taxed a sum equivalent to 5% of the new selling price (reducible with skills)for example:i am selling 10x mods at 10 000 001 isk each. i change them to be sold at 10 000 000 each. the total value of the new selling price is 10*10000000, or 100 mil isk, so i would be taxed 5 mil for making this change (instead of 100 isk ...)this would have the added benefit of making macro trading far less profitable."
5/12/2010,"people would just put up orders of very small quantities, so they can calcel and put them back instead of playing 0.01 games. trade rewards thsoe that play, so what's the issue there?macro traders are a plague, but 0.01 wars can't be removed (and don't need to).also, why does eve need more isk sinks? proof or stop posting. 0.0 has one giant isk sink, called sovereignty payments. and before you pretend that moon minerals compensate for it, no it doesn. they don't add isk to the system, just items. isk comes from mission rewards, bounties and insurance (that one is being reduced in tyrannis).tldr0.01 wars can't be removed (and don't need to).proof or stop posting."
5/12/2010,they can and should.
5/12/2010,"proof by assertion is a wonderful thing, n'est-ce pas? we have no need for additional isk sinks, and 0.01 wars are fine(and i say that as someone who does a lot of trade). i've also largely come to the conclusion that macro traders are a myth. so no, not supported."
5/12/2010,"untrue.well, exactly, you have the most to lose here. no wonder you dislike this idea.proof by assertion is a wonderful thing, n'est-ce pas?"
5/12/2010,"lol. also, the people who get angry about someone undercutting them by .01 isk are usually the people who initiated the price war. if you undercut the current sell prices, but not by enough for others to worry about matching your price, you shouldn't be mad when someone else undercuts your sell price."
5/12/2010,wow.you're dumb
5/12/2010,umtaxes are bad
5/12/2010,"i think that this should be modified as to not allow anyone other than a fleet to be able to jump in on you while you are doing a mission. at some point in the future, you will have eve pilots with 8 or 9 years piloting experience, camping mission complexes. newer players entering these plexes won't stand a chance against pve much less the experience needed to handle pvp as well. this discourages newer players from sticking around in eve. being jumped enroute to the mission is one thing however, being jumped on a difficult mission is simply put, a huge let down."
5/12/2010,no
5/12/2010,"no. aren't they already? bring more friends and/or revise your tactics/options.i'm sorry... welcome to eve. ""non-consensual pvp"" is our specialty. were you expecting something different?td;lr: not supported. next!!!"
5/12/2010,thats not eve.not supported.
5/12/2010,no can't support your idea as it stands. you have however shown us one of the risks for high sec mission runners.
5/12/2010,"i've several times run into the situation of a new corpie asking for a loan, but have not felt secure enough to give them that. the loan contract currently allows to loan money, but only accepts money as a collateral, making the point kinda moot. this could be dealt with by creating something that would allow the collateral to be item(s) like with rl loans. also, the possibility to have interest on loaned money would be appreciated."
5/12/2010,"loan contracts won't see a lot of use either way, but at least this will make it possible for someone sane to use them, in theory. and it does make sense. supported."
5/12/2010,"that and make the ability to cosign to a corp, alliance or other player =p"
5/12/2010,"not supported, again. ccp already considered and decided not to go with this idea for gate-linked systems."
5/12/2010,"atm powerblocs like to cram as many insects in one hole, this ofc makes the hole have lots of problems.this usually affects 0.0 and low sec, low sec being worse since it barely handles a fraction of what 0.0 can.i propose the node to have a failsafe.upon a node crash or extreme lag everything within that system will be immune to all damage, all timers will pause meaning even if an enemy sits with 5000 people in a system they will just stop timers.this will cause people to think more strategically and will kill blob warfare for good!"
5/12/2010,this idea is original zzazzt was talking about this @ ff06
5/12/2010,"nope.i'd say take the gallente storyline missions and seed them with only l4 agents, for all factions though."
5/12/2010,well you can put all level 4's in low sec if you want but no-one will ever run them and since most people run level 4 missions from time to time i dont think the entire eve community would be very happy with that decision. there are level 4 & 5 missions in low sec that do get use but there is still not enough benefit to warrant the majority of players to bother running missions in these areas.if you want to help low sec then please come up with a constructive suggestion for doing so.
5/12/2010,no thanks.
5/12/2010,"leave level 4s in high sec, but change missions so that they are fun, exciting and challenging, rather than tedious, utterly predictable, dps-based isk grinds. make them about gameplay rather than goldfarming.put some new resource exclusively in lo-sec so that there is a good reason to go there. the black market suggestion in the boost lo-sec thread was a good one."
5/12/2010,"if you move all lvl4's to low sec, all the carebears will farm lvl3's. move those to low sec and they'll do lvl2's. no amount of reward will change the carebear's mind. the absolute max single clienting income from missioning in high sec is under 50m an hour as is. yes, i'm contradicting you. you don't make 80m an hour missioning there with 1 toon. that would require you to solo blockade in under 30minutes and get it twice in a row. alternatively, you would need to solo unauthorized military presence about 20 times in an hour. so yeah, not happening. i'm valuing lp at around 1k isk/lp.low sec needs a pr boost, not an actual rewards boost relative to high sec. a few errand-boy storylines that take you to low sec (and only require a shuttle) is what's needed i think."
5/12/2010,"lies. high-sec missions, single account, bring in nowhere near that much.if you want to buff low-sec, don't do it in a way that nerfs other people's preferred playstyle. it's a sandbox, it's not your sandbox."
5/12/2010,op obviously knows nothing about 0.0 warfare or he would know that no fleet in their right mind would field even a single supercapital in a fleet battle without quite a few smaller ships to back it up.
5/12/2010,i think blast nicely illustrated that with their titan loss.

5/12/2010,in the uk volunteer work is considered employment by law and has its own set of legal rights. not only is it commonplace for cvs to have volunteer work listed in your previous employment history it is also encouraged.eva jobse is from the netherlands and they have their own legal description of what constitutes as employment.
5/12/2010,"same in the netherlands. volunteer work = unpaid employment by the company or organisation, legally speaking. however to add to the confusion, for work to be considered volunteer work it does not require a contract of employment, according to the dutch law.in the netherlands, eva is thus perfectly entitled to list her volunteer work for ccp as part of her employment history. while eva had to waive any claims to be a 'regular' ccp employee (because all regular employees are entitled to claim minium wages etc), she was an unpaid ccp employee according to dutch definitions and law, whenether ccp likes it or not.that, and it's perfectly normal and even encouraged in the netherlands to list all volunteer work as part of the employment history (to avoid gaps in the cv). although the 'employment history' section is called 'werkervaring', literally 'work experience' on the dutch cv. i'm sure that eva didn't feel like re-arranging her cv when translating it."
5/12/2010,"ah yes, she clearly forgot to mention the fact that she was not a ccp employee... boy howdy would it be convenient for me to just put whatever suits me on my resume and claim innocent oversights. also, who cares about dutch laws? ccp is an icelandic company. by that standard she was not an employee whether dutch law likes it or not.nevermind the fact that never did she perform one iota of game design or wiki development on behalf of ccp. the csm job is not even remotely resembling game design. the wiki she made of her own free will was certainly not a work product for ccp. in short your statements are as ridiculously far fetched as the idea that she ever worked for ccp in the first place. im dutch therefore i get to claim anyplace i ever had any slight association with as work experience globally... really? not here."
5/12/2010,"i think its clear to most people that this girl is unfit for anything. inbox spam, channel spams, rude comments, hate for large part of the players.she makes isk spammers look good..."
5/12/2010,"the dutch revenue service might take exception to your explanation.wat is een dienstbetrekkingregardless this was clearly padding of the c.v. ,as a employer i would applaud people keeping themselves busy and gaining experience by volunteering.trying to pass it of as actually being employed by the company just means i will bin your c.v. .especially if you are listing things you were not even involved in."
5/12/2010,"(...)waarop de werknemer tegen betaling werk verricht.the thing you're quoting is for paid employment and like i said, you don't need an employment contract for unpaid employment.and how did she not do those things? she did build a wiki, if not for her wiki, then the evelopedia would never have those old csm issues in there as the whole thing is copied directly out of hers. she set up the wiki, she structured it, so she did wiki-implementation.you're just a bunch of crybabies."
5/12/2010,no the thing i am quoting for is the definition of employment.no contract no pay means a fictive form of employment as far as the revenue service is concerned or none from a legal point of view.

5/12/2010,"i have looked at the products from your current employer. now not to say they are horrible, but they all seem rather lacking in almost all aspects. what i mean is they all seem rather simple minded. nothing very complex or compelling about them. the entire reason people play eve is everything opposite of the games you work on. judging by everything you have made from suggestions in the forums it sounds like you want to make eve more for the easy going and simple minded game play. less entertaining and less compelling.i for one shiver at the idea of the best mmo out there (face it, it is, rage on the forums all you want, it is) turned into the equivalent of some flash game on facebook (farmville in space?) that has no real meaning. please stay and enjoy eve for being eve and not wishing it was one of the games you work on.speaking of that company. i did not think of it until it was brought up, but i am not sure you being involved in the csm and working for another online game company is a good idea. conflict of interest comes to mind. false logs or not, it is just a bad idea.everyone always jokes that eve is about internet spaceships and internet spaceships is serious business. they say this jokingly but everyone know they are serious business. the games you work on are not serious business.like i said before, feel free to play eve if you like, but the csm council is not for you. you did it before and it was shall we say, less than stellar? maybe one day you will realize that eve is supposed to be serious business and enjoy it like the rest of us. after all, no other game out there can be plagued with lag issues and still keep growing and growing.in closing, i really don't mean this in a mean way but, you are simply not ready for csm.take care,-marlona sky"

5/12/2010,"this very upcoming expansion, no. i'm not going to tell ccp to postpone their planetary stuff nor do i expect them to even take me seriously if i make that suggestion.what i am trying to do is get ccp to devote more programmer time, designer time, etc, to getting old features fixed in the long term. for example almost every csm proposal submitted in the last two years about poses, have been turned down to either technical issues, or :effort: issues. i think ccp should put serious effort and coding time, etc, to fixing these old bears that are commonly used by players and cause them so much greif. if the csm could push ccp to do an entire mini-expension to release a better pos system, that would be awesome, and possibly something that could happen if the csm gets actual power.the mission loot mineral nerf change is going to affect my lowsec proposal- in that the details will eventually need to be changed around when the full effects of that change are feltalso the planetary interaction is going to affect my lowsec proposal. i would try to get ccp to give lowsec some sort of exclusive planet resources for example(but i dont know if that can be done in time, due to scheduling. we'll see)."

5/12/2010,you're ideas are positive and you have listed many of the issues i have with eve at this point. i hope you will look to actively boosting low sec which would be great since it would be fun to see low sec populated. i do hope you would go about boosting low sec in such a way that it doesnt nerf high sec at all. i would like to see better agents and more reward in low sec so high sec dwellers may be tempted to move out there. this can be done in a way that doesnt take anything away from players who may be happy in high sec. high sec players should be tempted to low sec and not pushed there.
5/12/2010,who did you get to write your initial post? it's littered with far too much correct spelling and punctuation.
5/12/2010,"don't u think, that it's better to make lvl4's in highsec less profitable, and just boost lowsec and 0.0 missions instead of removing it from highsec at all?"
5/12/2010,"this could work too. there is obviously problem with current level 4 high security space missions. solutions to this problem can vary, but anything is fine as long as goal would be reached. and goal is simple: introduce risk vs. reward concept to highsec mission-runners."
5/12/2010,"once again thank you to all my supporters. i think i've finally caught up on all the eve-mails just the one question to answer here though.as part of csm4 i raised and/or supported a number of wormhole related proposals (refitting t3 ships in wspace, shared corp bookmarks, saving probe formations).as i don't live in a wormhole system i won't try to second guess what issues players find while living there. however i will continue to support proposals raised by w-space residents and if you have any specific areas that you feel need to be looked at i would be happy to discuss various ideas."

5/12/2010,"you seemed like a decent person who had worked hard during the presentation at fanfest last year, and eve uni does really good work for the noob community, so you get my vote."
5/12/2010,thank you for your support!
5/12/2010,"ok, i'll admit it, i'm one of those idiots that has warp scrambled a gate by accident and had concord blow me to pieces. it's funny (and not so funny) at the same time. keeping that in mind, i am in the camp of removing insurance from ship destructions involving concord.yes, i realise this is a bit harsh for the people that don't read the warning messages, but eve is supposed to be a harsh universe. unfortunately, i don't think removing insurance at the moment would be a good thing due to the abysmal ui that can allow newer players who don't know the ui well to make this mistake without knowing they are actually making a mistake. once the ui is upgraded to the point where any ambiguity of whether your target is able to be shot or not is removed, then it should come in (imho).as for afk/script mining - it needs to be removed from the game. how this should be achieved, i have no definite insights into, but making mining more interactive is one thing i have pushed for in the past. unfortunately ccp in the past have seen this differently, but since my job would be to push the player concerns to ccp, i'm happy to give it another go.another thing i wouldn't mind seeing (and it was briefly discussed in the industry/sci forums) was t3 modular industrial ships. like the t3 cruisers, they would have base stats that are then modified based on different subsystems you install - better mining yield, heavier tank, etc.i think that would help a little for defence as the attacker couldn't be sure of what you would be fitted out with, and would have to be more cautious. it would also allow for specialized mining setups for those wanting them.i hope that answers your questions, feel free to ask more and i'll see what i can do to answer them :)"
5/12/2010,"seeing the ""informations"" that the eve economist gave in the old blog he has no real idea on the effect of t2 bpo, he love to do pretty charts and avoid any real attempt to see what is the in game effect. to be blunt i think he has not jet realized that eve is first a game, not a economic simulator. similarly, seeing how the only official data on the loot reprocessing where heavily contaminated by t2 reprocessing, ship reprocessing and mineral compression items i have some serious doubt about ccp capacity to know what is the real situation of the game. if you can get them to release real informations, cleared by dubious interpretations and spurious data it would be much appreciated. and if they go and remove t2 bpo, whatever form of compensation they decide to give, i pretend to have a collector item for my bpos, a ""gold framed (name) bpo"" to keep as a memento. no in game use beside being sold as a collector item (and maybe to be able to put it on a wall in my house in incarna), but i have worked to get mine and want to have something to remember them."
5/12/2010,"mud slinging is so csm4, i'm waiting for a candidate to get desperate enough to threaten to sue people in the name of their own power mad quest for csm power."
5/12/2010,"up.from the camp.website:""a true friend is one who has the courage to disagree with us when [we are] in the wrong, and advise us for our own good, rather than let his sympathy or sentimentality cause him to agree."" friendship is not friendship without trust, without it i walk alone. i prefer to concentrate on few topics instead of dealing with a lot of subjects, thus increasing the chance of performing succesfully. therefore, i want to arise attention on the following issues: general low sec revamp, the 5th csm should focus on outlaw space (militia and piracy reform, lvl 4th missions in low); aggression timer up to 1m.30 sec; align to bookmarks; wormhole: entering in wh space brings you 8000 km far from the wh exit. jump range 2500 km; rockets dps increase; add implants on capsule killmails; overload area is too small; inactive poss should be removed; make gang assist modules work when one or more squad commanders are not on grid; self destruct under aggression should generate killmail; user friendly killmail (xml); show items in containers when looking in assets; show lens damage. ships af revamp; dramiel balance (cost decrease, power grid decrease to 34, velocity decrease); worm balance (speed up, two launcher, one turret, power up to 36); deimos cost decrease;increase the eos drone bandwidth."
5/12/2010,"we all know that the ongoing capaign is having many potential candidates for counsils, however there are some capable runners knowing what they are doing and some that dont.theres also a guestion about theyr agendas and aims.whycome there is no ""candidate election machine"" within the eve online? it would tell you which candidates best match your interrests:here is how it works: candidade will submit a poll of interrests, which you select from priority 0-5 (5 beingh highest) in each gategory. gategories being from ranges of ideas, such as game bug fixing, economy, trade, mission developement, lowbie protection, low sector developement, ambience developement, background story, low level pvp, hi level pvp, wormhole, etch etch... in each gategory you can submit max of certain points, which depletes max appointable points / gategory. thus you cant submit a poll query of ""5"" in each step (you cant post all 5<U+FFFD>s you can post several 0<U+FFFD>s however, as you dont support this side of developement).now, a counsil candidate has submitted priorities and agenda, he can have open statement about what he represents, a bio for candidacy so to speak.now voter has ability to do the same, submit a poll and see who of the candidates best match his agenda. system compares the points given and shows candidates best matching your choise, and you can select a bio for review. after then, you can select if you want to vote for him, or send him a guestion about his/her campaign.now theres a way to better see who is best suited to represent your agenda."
5/12/2010,you could try the csm vote match website for this. you can find more information on it here:
5/12/2010,"vice decision for transfer, to be honest, i was not sure where this belonged to, as it is developement topic, yet its current event also.however site mentioned abowe does not fit the need of the request: because it wont target the candidates for you, and not all candidates use offsite pages. also, this is game issue, whycome i should need to go to different site in order to find a person in the game, for the game?also, this is not a big issue, as there is php templates and ready made opensource systems for this. during realtime elections, theres always general sites that allows doing this, questioneers where the politicians can submit theyr views so people can target them better. (usually from the press). poll machines are there for a reason, and i call for that reason. please, allow us players to find our candidate, that we could truly vote upon."
5/12/2010,"week 4 entries close tonight at midnight, est"
5/12/2010,"updated with the latest information. i really appeciate people sending in corrections and links to new interviews etc, please continue to do so!"
5/12/2010,"good work on them trying to cover everything but they focussed more on policies, which tended to run into each other. i'd have liked them to look at qualifications and other things that set candidate apart."
5/12/2010,"nyphur: i would like to point out that the idea of fleet stacking penalties was just that--an idea, not something i necessarily plan to champion. rather it is one of my goals if elected to focus on pvp balance related to blobs, ecm, and neutral remote repping. wouldn't mind seeing your entry for me adjusted to reflect that more accurately. the other goals are low sec improvements of an outlaw nature, ui fixes (especially related to streamlining cumbersome tasks), and better communications from ccp to players.that said, you did a very nice job on presenting the candidates--not an easy task to summarize all that, i'm sure."
5/12/2010,"-> the whole point of this alt is that he is dedicated to csm, keeping him free of my main's in-game reputation and keeping my main free of csm politics, remarks, mails, etc. check the website for my policies (see the next item). also, you can follow me o"
5/12/2010,3) waiting almost a month to reply to the only person who comments on your campaign thread. 4) posting two extra bonus spam campaign threads.
5/12/2010,"the greatness of eve stems from the greatness of its community, the many many players who fly, chat, blog, tweet, joke on vent and generally create that sense of belonging. eve is unique in that players are actively involved by the developer trough csm, however, as long as only a meagre percentage of players actually votes, our collective voice is but a whisper. after all, if the council only really represents a fraction of us all, what power does it have?my proposal to involve major alliance leaders qualitate qua in csm has a lot to do with this. they by nature of their prominence in in-game politics represent a great many of us. they are very involved with the playability of the game and can give in-depth feedback on many issues from sovereignty mechanics to drop levels. also, they have a vested interest in these subjects and will strongly make their point with ccp. leading an alliance is not easy, and it would also reward the players who dedicate themselves to the game in this way. it seems a very sensible and straightforward thing to implement this in the next iteration of csm. the council now being elected, csm5, should establish a ratio of alliance leaders to other csm members, and a minimum alliance size for involvement.independent candidates such as myself are also important to make sure the csm does not become the domain of fleet battle planning, sovereignty hoarding powergamers. we need your votes. who you vote for is ultimately less important than that you vote. every player adds to our credence and influence with ccp and with each other. every vote counts. we must not whisper but roar!vote! be heard! i call on all of you!. vox populi, vox dei. vote macclone! jump for csm!"
5/12/2010,"eves upcoming expansion is causing a stir mainly for the new features expected in this release. the game is expanded with more gameplay and more interactivity trough the client and website, and this is in many ways a great improvement of eve.however, there is still quite a big difference between the super-scifi interface shown in promotional movies like the new tyrannis trailer, and the infamous spreadsheets-in-space approach of the client interface. one of my main goals as a csm candidate is to influence ccp to improve the game in more subtle ways in each release. a big step in the right direction would be upgrading the user interface into the sleek and sexy interactive treat presented in the promo videos. this would make the game more engaging, playable and immersive without dramatic changes like revolutionizing the industrial and territorial aspects of the game as tyrannis does.fixes and features should be inseparable and complementary parts of new releases. ccp, hats off to you guys for your almighty work on tyrannis. however, as long as youre going to ask for our opinion, id like to point out that there is a lot of room for improvement that doesnt involve altering the nature of the universe and our relation to it. dont nerf space into a small sphere around stars. space is huge, open and empty by definition. let us go there and hide our ships in the folds of darkness between stars, as we mean to. pour your efforts and enthusiasm into giving us a user interface that reminds us of minority report instead of the accountant. it would be appreciated every second we play.i would be gravely misrepresenting my fellow players of i did not also address lag in this context. although the ramsan upgrades, the anticipating of announced fleetfights and all the improvements tested on sisi are all meant to improve this problem, for many it feels like ccp is not doing enough. fleet fights still turn into slideshows, destroying the fun and excitement and leaving players frustrated and annoyed. as long as this is not adressed more fully, any expansion is going to feel like a dud to many of us.everyone realizes that tranquility pushes the limits of what is technologically possible every day, wed rather pay for more hardware to make the game run smooth than for more developers to crank out releases like tyrannis. hear us. we love the game first, the extras second. make the game run well, then well see how we can expand it.the whole point of the csm is that expansiona are not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition, but something that developers and players synergistically improve to their mutual benefit. lets make it happen. vote macclone!"
5/12/2010,"if you mean personal ability... well, my rl history speaks for itself. there is no issue with the groundwork... it gets done. my only concern is whether i will be able to take that groundwork and effect enough compromise within the csm; and between the csm and ccp. and that i really won't know until and unless i am on csm5 to try.there are enough candidates who were on prior councils, and who can run again due to changes in the term-limits rule, that i have my doubts as to the possibility of getting on the council. i think the term-limits change was a bad idea. it has high potential for making the csm a clique with largely the same people returning council after council. if elected, i intend to suggest some modifications... such as limiting members to 2 consecutive terms, and requiring a 2-year break before such candidates could run again. this would allow for more turnover in the csm without forever forbidding seated members from being on the council again.my advertising reads:vote wisely!!!greymouse for csm5"

5/13/2010,"the current cyno effect is so lame, so weak. the old one gave such an awesome feel for the immense power needed to distort space--really want it back!"
5/13/2010,hell yeh
5/13/2010,"you are horribly wrong. blaster tracking sucks. it needs to double to make them effective. it is embarrassing, because when you get to your optimal you cannot hit anything, due to trasversal, so you have to operate in faloff, which reduces your damage. because that's not what's suppose to happen, right?and what about those 99% of the cases when you are not sitting with no motion at 0 at the gate and wait to get tackled?again, wrong,get out of 1x faloff and the damage becomes paint scratching, because damage decreases exponentially with range."
5/13/2010,"i still think it's a half-assed solution.minmatar always had the fast, rusty, primitive look'n'feel, maybe niche is not the correct word i would call it a major feature :pall solutions i see are always in the same line of though but with different attributes, replace speed with damage or range or tracking and in the end you just have 'give it 50% more of x and everything will be ok'. maybe the solution will be more in the ac line of though, a bit more here, a bit more there, i mean a full weapon system redesign that doesn't change the basic principals of blasters - it must hurt up close.maybe the 'definition' of close range must be increased just like the range of falloff was a few time ago, give it a bit more range, tracking, damage, and even a bit of speed in some ships if you still have to.i'm not the excel/eve expert guy to do nice graphs to show how much should be given to each weapon/ship to make it work, and a full re-design (calibration) really looks like a very difficult task but they did it to acs didn't they?please make it work without giving major features to other races, otherwise in 1 year gallent will be speed, amarr shield tanking, caldari drones and minmatar target painters - just exaggerating a bit :-p"
5/13/2010,"the latter, of course. the reason people don't fly shield fit gallente more is that they suck and don't know how to play. in fact, if gallente could fit neutrons without lol rcus and if they didn't have ships which are sometimes ******ed stat wise (eg. brutix uses that so potentially useful utility high over cyclone to get a awesome 10m3 more dronebay, seriously now?), they would (in shield fits) be passable. if they got a dps boost on top they'd be more then passable.the only gallente t1 ships which you can fit reasonably with neutrons is the shield myrmidon and the megathron, the rest of them require glass-cannon fits or rcus. which made sense in the age when the neutron blaster was the top dog, but laser dps got boosted since that day, ac dps got boosted, torp dps got boosted... these fitting stats are completely unjustified in this day and age.by the way; when you look at those (sad) dps/ehp stats, don't you feel horrible about the fact that a equivalent minmatar ship has very good odds of bbq-ing you point blank, or that the vexor will just **** the thorax at any range (most likely a moa and arbitrator, too, haha)? that is highly indicative of the fitting (and to some extent dps) issues i'm talking about.i do a lot of upclose murdering, and i have never considered flying gallente for that because they simply do not offer a tangible advantage in the zone where they're supposed to be superior.also, devil's advocate: sub-bs blasterboats would be 11ty billion times better with more mids for shieldtank fits, since shieldtank takes a lot of the blaster woes away, and naturally removal of stupid active rep bonuses which prevent you from fitting damage mods and decent guns if you take advantage of the bonus. no, seriously; most medium sized blaster boats are better with shield buffer as things are (case in point brutix). people just insist on doing the wrong things, but that's not a ship problem, you still have people who fit purger rigs and sprs to drakes and take them out to pvp (granted, fairly rare these days) and complain how caldari suck. people are just not comprehending how scrambler only for tackle works just fine. you're doing it wrong, that is not a turret problem.although you are correct that a damage increase is not honestly a range increase because at 1x falloff the dps is negligible."
5/13/2010,"rofl, talk about being a total noob with blasters.you know there is something called to move around while you fight to lower your transersal right?.if you just sits there and just shoot, you deserve to die in a big ass fire to stupidity.and if you double the blaster tracking, then what is the point with the web nerf earlier?."
5/13/2010,"this. why fly a blaster boat if you can fly an ac or pulse boat? if there isn't an answer, it doesn't have a niche.the brutix is a fine example of either-or bonuses (almost like the classic split-weapon minmatar ships). potentially this would be different if active tanking was more on-par with buffer/passive tanks. without work on active armor tanks, gallente ships would be better off without the rep bonuses.i am guilty of shield+speed+blasters on gallente ships in most cases. it is simply a better fit for the role they are supposed to fill. however, the comparable amarr/minmatar ships do it better because you don't waste bonuses."
5/13/2010,"i agree that ungrouping your guns would essential create more chances to penetrate. however, would this also not mean that your volley damage is so low that any penetrating hits would be of next to no noticeable damage. also, using two rail ships vs one target, so what, they should win.and on the subject of passive shield tankers being the most vulnerable, would this be a bad thing?"
5/13/2010,i never knew that there were caldari and gallente rails. here i was just thinking that you put the same weapons on each ship.
5/13/2010,"yeah, but hold your horses now. you pick the rokh which happens to be the only battleship in its tier that is geared towards fleet sniping. then you compare it to the apoc, which is a much more versatile ship and one tier lower. from there you conclude that the rokh fairs well in that comparison (when looking at the pure ehp and dps aspect of sniper works) and then, since the rokh seem fine with railguns you pretend that you thereby have demonstrated that railguns are fine?"
5/13/2010,"kinda,then he tries to blob us(goon way) with his many posts/days repeating this again and again.he doesnt mind he was proven wrong already."
5/13/2010,"i like his logic in in that ""one ship using rails is fine, therefore all ships using rails are fine."""
5/13/2010,"the rokh is a great killmail *****. high rof, good buffer (so it isn't primaried often), and extreme range to hit almost anything. it doesn't contribute to a fight like other snipers, but if you want to be on as many killmails as possible, this is your bs. if you don't want to be loathed by everyone else in the fleet because you are flying a selfish ship that doesn't pull its weight... you might want to fly something else.gallente snipers, on the other hand, are just a pile of weaker-than. weak range, weak tank, weak speed, and weak damage."
5/13/2010,"no. the logic is ""some ships using rails are fine, therefore the problems are not with railguns, but with the ships that are not fine"""
5/13/2010,"i do not know why but rails on rokh, ferox, harpy, vulture, moa, merlin, eagle shoot significantly farther then rails on gallente ships. i did not discovered where is secret but it is so"
5/13/2010,"it seems like the important question is whether there's more ships they're broken on than not. and the answer to that is a resounding ""yes"". rails are the problems, and any ship which is deemed problematic after the rail fix can be tweaked. imo, as long as they are reasonable with the hybrid fix there won't be any ship tweaks required.-liang"
5/13/2010,"right! rails on rokh is fine. all gallente ships are not fine with rails.ccp do not want to think about fine-tuning blasters and ""gallente rails"". so there is simple idea. change damage bonus for gallente ships from 5% to 7,5%. it is simple microboost for ""gallente rails"" and blasters."
5/13/2010,"blasters aren't ok on the rokh, nor on the mega or hype. rails aren't sufficiently awesome on the rokh, and they outright suck on pretty much everything else. the problem here is hybrids as a whole... trying to balance the ships around this individually is folly.-liang"
5/13/2010,"my enlighted master asked me to approve this thread.since in the modern world slaves can vote as well (wtf?), i'm abusing this and voting."
5/13/2010,"this idea is among the stupidest non-troll proposals i've ever seen on the assembly hall. you think that the sleipnir, one of the scariest ships in eve, needs a massive buff? you're crazy."
5/13/2010,"totally agree with the op. except that being able to refit in bare space would be silly. but inside a pos, definitely."
5/13/2010,supported
5/13/2010,i support this whole heartedly
5/13/2010,"hellz yeah, awesome idea. i also support an ""attack enemy ewar/damage/rep drones"" option if possible."
5/13/2010,keeping hope alive.
5/13/2010,yes
5/13/2010,good.
5/13/2010,yes larger font options.

5/13/2010,1
5/13/2010,pretty nice idea
5/13/2010,"agreed,however i think they should just get rid of the password all together and it be dependant on the owning corp's standing (including allience inheretance).in this case the options would be:allow corp (by default)1) allow allince2) allow standing [textbox]also allow ""put"" access (but not see or take) of the fuel bay to anyone."
5/13/2010,"any account security feature not applied to every account is not a feature i will endorse.a low cost alternative could be simply a card mailed to each player with a few hundred unique one time use codes which must be used in order client would state which one was used last or some such. also a feature like this would facilitate secure account sharing, thus i am reluctant to endorse it for that reason as well."
5/13/2010,"i know i'm going to get flamed to hell and back for this but here i go.no no nowhy?the majority of people who get there accounts hacked is because1. they have no concept of what a strong password is2. visiting gold selling, wares and hack sites3. downloading random stuff on the internet, i.e hacks, cracks, any tiny piece of software they can find to cheat with.4. not having adequate anti virus, malware and spyware software on their machine. people point to wow. you just have to look at player base of wow... mostly made up of stupid little kids who are always looking for ways cheat the system, so they visit every gold selling sites they can, downloading every hack they can.. no surprise that they get their account hacked.if you use a strong password which you change on a regular basis, use an up to date anti virus, malware and spyware software, don't submit your login details on any website and do not download software from wares sites then you will not get your account hacked.why should i have to pay for other people reckless actions.its all well and good to say if you don't want it don't pay for it, but there is still a cost, both in manpower and financial, to be incurred to setup the system.so we at some point we all have to pay.just think about it.if you do not visit any wares/hack/gold selling sites, if you do not give out your login details, if you do not download software from anywhere other then a valid and repeatable source, if you keep all your anti virus/malware/spyware software up to date, if you use a strong password and change it on a regular basis, then how is your account going to get hacked?hackers do not specifically target people. they simply hide their trojans/viruses/worms/key loggers etc.. in software and wait for idiots to download it.trust me i know"
5/13/2010,"yes, because 'good and reliable sites' never get hacked, updated anti-virus always offer 100% protection and santa lives in the north pole. all your security measures are valid and should be followed, but another security layer will never hurt.supported."
5/13/2010,"i don't remember where this was said, but a dev pointed out that many accounts are ""hacked"" without password fails. likely because people use the same username and password on websites as they use for their account.additionally, one of those keychain devices is easier to break en mass (especially if a hacker can buy one) than the current method of using strong passwords. if someone figured out the algorithm (and this happens... especially when a hacker can buy a copy), that would likely be the end of eve. so, unless normal passwords were required as well as the keys (for those who want the keys), not supported, because these would likely only provide a false sense of security."
5/13/2010,"in regards to authentication fobs such as the rsa secure id fobs.. these have been hack before, however instead of only a few accounts being hacked, its was 1000's.also as a previous posted stated, the majority of accounts have not had they password hacked. this would mean they have either given there password to somebody, or they have a key logger installed on their machine.if you visit other mmo's it is always the story.the passwords have not been hacked, user just login to find that their characters have been stripped bare."
5/13/2010,i've been following this topic since last september:
5/13/2010,"this is one of many proposals/issues which have had strong support on the forums and in csm... then nothing. it would be nice to have all the existing ""in process"" issues updated."
5/13/2010,i'm up for any buffs on all the non-thrasher destroyers.edit: thumbs up!
5/13/2010,supporting my own thread
5/13/2010,"1. when you have [want to buy] or [want a gift] contract, with a pile of items, like fuel or ammo, you can't complete it, even if you have this required items in your hangar. you have to split the pile, and make the smaller one with the exact number, the contract require. i guess you can consider this as an extra ""anti-scam"" option, but we need an option to turn this ""feature"" off. imagine, that you need to give a fuel for the 300 capitals in your alliance, and you will get the scope of this problem. (txs for klemenzo & krechmer for pointing that out)2. right now there is no ""sort by contracts"" option in contract system, only ""sort by page"" option, and if you have more than one page, its pretty hard to sort things out, and find the best offer there. 3. lots of my friends asked for the ""sort by distance"" option, to find the closest contracts they can get. 4. multiple items search option. for example i need to monitor the faction small energy neutralizers, but we have 4 identical items, imperial navy, ammatar navy, true sansha and dark blood small energy neutralizers. i have to search them 1 by 1 every time i want to check the cheapest one.[end]"
5/13/2010,"i just took a look at the tyrannis patch notes. while they are certainly not finalized for another week, i don't see that there's anything in there about alliance logos. can we please get a ccp comment on this?"
5/13/2010,supported
5/13/2010,"when was the last time you saw an alliance logo added to the game?how many times have they posted that there's a new system for adding alliance logos to the game since then?basically, despite there being several ""updates"" to the alliance logo submission system, there hasn't been an alliance logo added to the game in about two years. if we don't ride them about this, it'll never happen."
5/13/2010,"see all the alliances without logos that have been around for 1-2 years.my fingers are crossed that this will be rectified with tyrannis, but there hasn't been any feedback on this topic, so here's to hoping."
5/13/2010,what a joke tbhccp are the most procrastinating company i've ever seensupported
5/13/2010,"dotlan is actually a poor example of what alliances do and don't have logos in. we contacted the dotlan admin directly and asked him to include our logo on the site, but, our logo is still not in the game."
5/13/2010,lol cajone seeds xdhells no to lvl5s in high sec . they should remove the ones that are there already.
5/13/2010,actually this isnt a bad idea. level 5 missions are more difficult than level 4s and one of the factors for determining mission rewards is the security status of the system the agent is based in. if the high sec level 5s reward was kept in line with the security status of the system it would work out fine. the missions would need to be such that one battleship couldnt tank the mission of course so team work would be the key.im still surprised that ccp placed level 5s in low sec in the first place. did they expect anyone to run them?nothing wrong with the idea at all.
5/13/2010,"not supported. different zones have their exclusive content. level 5's and fw are low sec only content and it should stay that way. also, lvl5's are boring and repetitive just like all other missions.a challenge demands risk of failure by definition. in eve that means your ship explodes. how many ships do you think you'll lose in lvl5's? once you've got them all memorized, how often will you lose one cause it's still challenging? i think you want a new isk faucet to grind, not a challenge."
5/13/2010,"they are not an isk faucet, please stay away from them."
5/13/2010,very few ships can solo lvl 5's. and usually encourages a group so it adding more wouldnt be too bad.
5/13/2010,"the only issue i see with this is blasters, why not just add 30km to their optimal?"
5/13/2010,"i am getting increasingly frustrated with ccp's stance to the pos code. as i understand it, the long term plan is to replace them entirely, but so far i have seen no plans of what will be replacing them nor any word about when. either redo the code ground up or scrap pos entirely."
5/13/2010,"does this translate to ewar modules as well in that they calculate their range from the tower and not their own position?if so, definitely supporting that this needs changed."
5/13/2010,"shame people make new threads on this, will never get looked at this way"
5/13/2010,yes
5/13/2010,more shiny please
5/13/2010,yes
5/13/2010,"they should be a way we can paint our own ships and add logos, it could turn out to be a mild to major profession too.have it so we obtain minerals from planets for example and with the aid of skills / facilities produce ink / paint :d where we can paint ships or for the sake of ego stations / structures."
5/13/2010,"i forgot when my cruiser 5 ended and lost about 6 hours. anyway, on the topic of the op, 24 hours is plenty. it lets you log in when you want during the day, check your skills, or - what i normally do - just leave eve hq running and check it occasionally to see when the skill is going to end if i don't feel like logging in."
5/13/2010,give them a finger...
5/13/2010,"i've never had to wake up early to put in an eve skill, ever. so you must be doing something really wrong. as soon as you see your current skill queue < 24h, you quickly add a next skill to tide you over for the night. or you do the old switcheroo. like if your current skill still takes 23 hours, and you want to train, say, fuel conservation afterwards, you put fc 1, 2, and 3 first (about 6 hours or so, iirc) and move your current skill to the end of the line. that way your queue will be good for more than another day again.so, not supported."
5/13/2010,"you made a slight typo in your proposal. you typed ""48"", when you clearly meant to type ""why do i have to train my skills on ccp's schedule anyways? it should be unlimited!"" i've said for years now. i want to be able to create an alt, sub him for a year, leave him in a hangar full of books, and come back to a titan alt. skills are too fundamental for us to have to **** around with them. supporting this. that said, it's not going to happen. adapt. put a long skill into the queue - if your current skill runs longer than a day, switch what skill you train."
5/13/2010,why not 9 months?
5/13/2010,"thanks for the replies :)like i said, this is mainly for people who do not have access to their machine everyday, hence they end up losing days if not weeks during the year of training time simply because they have no access.maybe the ability to access your training queue via eve gate could be a possibility?this way you could leave the 24 hours time frame alone as you could access your training queue when ever and where ever you are.after all are giving us the ability to access eve mail and and edit our bio with eve gate as well as the ability to see our character profiles and skills.not too sure where the comments about having to wake up came from but hey :)once again thanks for the replies :)"
5/13/2010,sounds reasonable to me.
5/13/2010,"i support this; i want to love my electronic attack frigates, but i'm having a hard time doing it right now."
5/13/2010,"no, we'd know it was you even if you typed like an ordinary human."
5/13/2010,"holy crap. i cannot even believe the idiocy my eyes are seeing currently.well, here's my .02this happened to me, back when i was a high-sec loving carebear, knew nothing of fittings, and thought that my ship class meant everything.exhibit a:"
5/13/2010,dude how did that work lol
5/13/2010,"nobody needs to actually argue with tj ever again, no matter what it's about or what stance he takes. he could be saying ""the sun is hot."", and you could counter with ""you lost a dramiel to a badger."", and he would automatically lose the argument."
5/13/2010,this.
5/13/2010,"just as i train up for what i was led to believe was a decent ship ccp then pull this crap on me! now i've got to train for a badger? wtf ccp? pro-tip: if you have to ""pro-tip"" people it's probably best to wait until you've killed them."
5/13/2010,this
5/13/2010,i'd suggest that this guy be banned from posting any more proposals... or anything at all... but the lulz are just too great.
5/13/2010,"i suggested that on 2nd or 3rd proposal of his. it was clear from the start that his thinking ability was impaired.however, i don't think ccp would dare discriminate against mentally handicapped, especially since they employ several such people in key positions of game design."
5/13/2010,fyp
5/13/2010,i think your an idiot. most mission income is from bounties.
5/13/2010,not that i agree with the proposal but i do think he is talking about bounties on players in witch case you are the idiot
5/13/2010,"then if only npcs can collect bounties it is also ******ed. think about it for a min, bounty hunting should be a profession, the problem now is its hard to and when someone gets a high bounty they just kill themselves"
5/13/2010,"durrrrrrrrrrr. you're the idiot (see, i bolded the proper usage of the word). if you read the post, you'd see i was referring only to bounties that players placed on another player.more over, bounty hunting as a profession doesn't even exist right now. it's merely a trophy to show how arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr you are. thus, this would allow players to use the bounty mechanism for one reason. under this system, players could pay to annoy players they otherwise wouldn't have the means to kill themselves.note the distinction between annoy and kill. if i want to kill someone right now, i come at them with bc/bs/whatevs. if i didn't want to take the time/effort/risk to do so, i could simply throw some isk to make their life a bit more annoying by paying for targeted npc spawns.the problem with bounties at all is that ccp has made it clear they're ok with people running multiple accounts at the same time (understandably, for fiscal reasons). as a result, there's no way to implement a punishment/reward schema that won't be exploited (by multi-account alts, corpmates, what have you). thus, bounties should be somewhat useful by allowing people to harass others for a price.read before you post."
5/13/2010,"theoretically, he wouldn't can flip u in low sec. period. anyway, lemme get this straight--u're gonna ""help"" those newbs by implementing a mechanic that can be used to place a bounty on them so npcs can harass and kill them non-stop just so u don't face the consequences for afk griefing newbies? another fail proposal for more easy high sec ganks with no suiciding/sec loss required. not supported."
5/13/2010,"are you also opposed to merc corps? jesus, it's just a way to add some spice to travel by having npc's spawn/attack not in belts/plexes."
5/13/2010,"thought i might post this while pushing a fenrir through empire.a few things that have been ingame for years now and probably annoyed everyone, that has flown capitals, at some point. not gamebreaker mind you, but wouldnt it be nice if....ccp would finalize their efforts to stop bumping...a titans jumpbridge range would be increased to 10km or even further..not everyone in the same fleet as the capital would have access to its shiphangar even without configuration. maybe even have different ""layers"" similar to corphangars...there was the option to sort every dronetype into its own category with the click of a button...drones and fighter/bomber would not appear inside shields if launched close to the pos shield and fly around it instead of straight through, resulting in the drones losing lock and turning around...an toggled drone-category ""in space"", when recalled, would automaticly collapse ""in hangar/ship"". or atleast if there would be the option for that...ctrl+leftmouse-click would lock a broadcaster from the broadcast window, like it does from the watchlist...the ingame capital navigation window would become its own button, maybe next to ""cargo"" and above ""show tactical overlay""...the cynobroadcast would show the location of the cyno...we could get the old jumpeffect back or a new shinier one - a plop doesnt carry the time and effort put into these ships very well."
5/13/2010,"i think the biggest flaw of capitals is their unbridled use on the forums.people of earth, posting in capital letters will not hammer the idea home more, it will make people hate you."
5/13/2010,"the diemos lacks identity and even more criminally for a hac specialisation.the cruiser blaster area is pretty crowded, thorax, brutix, vigilant, proteus, moa, eagle, ferox. the diemos is slotted as thorax < diemos < brutix with the vigilant being everything the diemos wanted to be but isn't. i'd tweak the diemo's role to something unique, a true knife fighter, in eve terms high speed / low siggy.dps isn't really a major issue - 760 odd is good for a hac and anyway blaster dps is a multiship issue that might be fixed soon idpendant of the hull.slots:change to 5/4/6wtf is the point of that last high? we want specialised face melting dps boat.attributesincrease speed to 300 after skills (+40 ish?) - 2kms on mwd, a vaga is still 25% faster.reduce siggy to 80+ 20 cpu for the extra mid.+ 50 grid as its 2 low anywaybonusmwd - +7.5% trackingfalloff - +7.5% recieved rrso why would you take a diemos now? - gets in range fast, has the tackle to keep a target in range. minimises damage with a low siggy and speed while still hitting well with the tracking bonus. stays alive through boosted rr and hac resistances.not at all a solo pwn boat but more then enough differences to a brutix to fly one and worth the extra 100 mil if you use it in its own specialised way."
5/13/2010,methinks youve gone a bit overboard there loli say double the hac damage bonus and replace falloff with a mwd cap or sig bonus or summin
5/13/2010,it already has a cap bonus to mwd's with the gall. cruiser skill.
5/13/2010,"the diemost suffers from having to fight up close where hacs typically go to die. this is where the name comes from. it also suffers from being a lolarmortank combined with short-range blasters (read: sloooooow dooooown). the shield brutix is almost always a better choice.therefore: +1 gun, +2 mid, -2 low, damage/damage/falloff/10% shield hp bonus. awesomeness ensues in 3...2...1"
5/13/2010,tracking bonus is good. mwd speed bonus is better.fixed it for you ccp!
5/13/2010,"diemosslot layout: 5/4/6(-1 high slot, + 1 med slot)hardpoints: 4 turrets(-1), 0 missles(unchanged)gallente cruiser skill:5% to medium hybrid damage per level7.5% to medium hybrid tracking per level(changed from 5% mwd cap bonus)heavy assault cruiser skill:10% to medium hybrid falloff per level10% to medium hybrid damage per skill level(changed from 5% per skill level)base structure hit points: 5062(+2531)base powergrid: 890(-100)base cpu: samebase cap: 1975(+400)base lock range: 34km(-31km)base signature radius: 120m(-40m)just my 2 cents."
5/13/2010,"still doesn't make up for the turret loss tbh (5*1.25*1.25=7,8125, 4*1.5=7.5). i don't think the ship needs a dps decrease."
5/13/2010,"it is not a nice idea, it is a result of a mind numbing 25 pages diemos thread on shc and took multiple days to do all the numbers and tweak it.it is also not only a in your face hac concept but a extreme flexible medium range support rail hac with the ehp of a bc plus puls zealot dps performance(with damage drones). i got the hac damage bonus at 15% per level first but i think it would outdo true sniper hacs in this style. in general it is only a small dps exchange for a lot more flexibility at any range, ehp, fixed fitting(both cpu and powergrid) and being useful in a 2. role that doesn't require dying this much."
5/13/2010,"as already said, the deimos is competing with many ships in its role. the brutix does the same the deimos does, same dps and same ehp.what the deimos should have going for it, and alrdy does, is speed/agility/locktime/sigradius.all of thosnough tho, for starters the deimos has a sig radius of 160m, the zealot for comparison 125m. a better agility would help, too, for maneuvering under hostile guns and lockspeed increase."
5/13/2010,"how i would do it:swap hybrid falloff bonus for +1km of hybrid optimal per level, applied after ammo modifications and whatnot.that means that the deimos can operate just outside of scram range with null and neutrons (getting a 10km optimal) or can avoid the tracking issues of normal blasters by being able to operate a little further out.it also gives it a definite niche over the brutix, and doesn't infringe on the vagabond or zealot, as they both still outrange it by substantial amounts, and have other advantages."

5/13/2010,ibtledit - i support locking this thread.
5/13/2010,thread locked as user requested.
5/13/2010,"as per humar normal error, they take the worst case scenario as the only outcome. as is right now, even if a falcon only has a 5% chance of jamming you, it can in theory jam you for 15 min straight. it can also miss ever single jam between two downtimes if it has a 95% chance of jamming you. this is the nature of being percentage based taken to it's extremes. the more ""natural way"" things tend to happen is to be a rough 30-70 - positive outcome scenario (for the person casting it). even if the chances are very low for an ecm boat to jam someone, they will more often than not, in fact jam them. what the simple proposal put forth does in practical terms, is reducing the duration of wich you are under negative effect. the problem with ecm is that it's nowhere near the described ""balance"" between races. as is all races are indeed very evenly based. but only one, i'll say it again, only one module will render any ship in the game completely useless for the duration of wich it's in effect. that's the ecm.to further explain why, i'll toss you a few scenarios and examples. let's say i'm in a drake. i encounter a gang that consists of two vagabonds, one rapier and one falcon/rook (doesn't really matter). now, in my drake, i can quite happily engage the gang if it wasn't for the ecm. i'd probably end up dead, but assuming i could get tackle on one of the vagas or the rapier, i'd at least take one ship down with me. but here is the most likely outcome:-i engage (assuming i have no other option, as i'll be tackled before i can warp off anyway being a bc if i land/jump in next to them) and i get tackle on a vaga (scram+web). i now say to myself ""haha, diaf motherfrakker!"". now a falcon uncloaks and then i'm more like . why? firstly, he messes with my targeting in such a way i can't do anything anymore. my tackle is gone, my mobility is gone (rapier) and my damage is gone (drones are still firing obv.). now, assuming i have f.o.f's with me, i can load them. that's 10 sec gone, so 10 sec left on jam cycle. ok, so i start launching fof's. god damit! they're just shooting the drones! what good is that supposed to do? ah, yes, they started shooting the silly vaga instead! awesome! so then the falcon lose jam on me, and i can lock again. i want to shoot the same vaga as i did first, cause i got him to 50% shields, so i lock him up and tackle him (he's a stupid vaga pilot). but now i can't direct my damage on him, as i have f.o.f.'s loaded... wth? ok, reload... frakk! i'm jammed... poop. out comes my pod.that's one scenario. for any other ewar than the ecm module there are at least three ways of countering any effect they have on you. damps have senor booster and signal amplifiers, aswell as gang bonuses when in a gang, to both targeting range and scan resolution aswell as rigs and remote sensor boosters. if you talk methods of negating it by gameplay it could be, but not limitied to -webbing your target to make sure it can't get outside your lock range. making sure you're faster than your target to make sure you keep the range. go outside the damps relativly short range and hope for misses in falloff and lastly, just nuke the frakker tracking disruptors have tracking computers, tracking enhancers, rigs, drugs and tracking links. and in some cases, tracking bonused ammo. as far as trackign disruptors go and negating with playstyle, you have webs to minimize transversal, you can manually manouver your ship to minimize transversal. you can shoot a bigger target if one is available. you can move your drones from target to target and so on.ecm has two. and that's it. remote and local eccm."
5/13/2010,"(frakking 5 min timer on forums wth?)this is excluding implants, but even there the implants that affects your ships sensor strength are in slots that would benefit you more with other implants. there is in fact entire sets for sensor strenght, while the others only have hardwirings, but it's more costly and harder to get.all in all, ecm stands out as the single ewar module that is too unbalanced compared to the others in the game. the main difference, and herein lies the issue, it affects everything, every time. when jammed, you lose the ability to control your drones appropriately, you lose the ability to hold someone down. you lose the ability to use your guns. you lose the ability to use your missiles (not exactly, but make it really hard to shoot what you want). you lose the ability to activly defend yourself in short. all of this can in one way or the other be done when under the effect of any of the other ewar modules in the game. this is why it needs to be reworked. is what i have suggested perfect? no, not by any means. is it better than what is currently in the game? in my honest opinion, yes, in practical use? who knows, maybe, maybe not.a short note btw, to people saying the caldari recons have no tank, they have exactly the same tank as any other recon, or you're fitting it wrong, just sayin. not that i mind, makes them easier to pop, so please do keep on fitting them without any tank at all regarding losing the lock of all targets, yes, it should. basicly, if you read what i have said is to make it work exactly how the ecm burst operates right now, but instead of being aoe (area of effect) it should be focused. one module, one target, one lock breaks. the part where i said stuff about losing not all locks was a part where i/we/some were theorycrafting about how the eccm could work. basicly act like a buffer for the locking computer, enabling you to keep lock on a/some random selected locked targets, but the ecm ship would always be free (you'll always lose lock on it).also, nerfing ecm, or chaning it more like, not exacly a huge nerf, will not render caldari useless in pvp. the drake is an awesome boat, the flycatcher is being used to great success by us as a nice tackler (more like bubbler, but you get the picture i hope), the hawk and harpy are both good shield based as's, the ktisune is anoyign as **** to encounter, the basilisk is a superb logistic, the scorpion is never wrong, the raptor is a good tackler. the nighhawk is a superb cs for gangs, the cerb is very nice in hac gangs, the eagle is an alright sniper, and so goes the list. the main thing about caldari is, if you want to fly it, you'd need more caldari pilots. caldari is much more specialized in one aspect of the game, being ""i want to fly with caldari ships on my side"". all the other races have ships that does better in dual roles. but a pure caldari fleet is actually a sight to be afraid of. and to those that laugh at the sound of that, you've never actually seen what a caldari fleet can do so in short, caldari doesn't need to be ""nerferd"" as much as ""put in line"" with the rest, as far as ewar goes. missiles are getting better (fix my rockets ccp!) for each time they actually improve their missile coding, their tanks are outdone by none when in a proper manner and fleet, and they do in fact have the best ewar platforms. the lat fact wouldn't change even if the ecm changed, as nothing can really mess with a fleet as much as losing lock. be it for 1 second or 20, it's still the most effective way you can disrupt a hostile fleet. as is however, you can disrupt it a bit too much compared to what the others do. and no, jamming is not the only thing caldari does. it's just the only thing most people see, as noone is willing or able to field a proper caldari fleet. for those who can, i suggest you do, and laugh at the carnage that can be created when done right."

5/13/2010,this.5% to change an order? you on crack?
5/13/2010,"my understanding of (some of) the reasoning behind the way the market works is this:1) there need to be mechanisms to stop people trying to gouge a market, then immediately lower prices when competition arrives.2) selling on the market is largely an afk activity, so something needs to reward the active market player3) the market is an ideal place to include isk sinks to counter-balance isk sourcesfor point 1, broker fees stop people pricing things way too high by charging based on the total sell price. if you significantly lower your orders, you have still paid a high amount in fees, cutting into profit.regarding point 2, the active player who logs on and keeps orders up to date, and actually spends time in a region is able to undercut competition by 0.01 isk. without this mechanism, an individual could place orders all over the place and never have to actually maintain them. it also means that the (often large) amounts of money that can be made on the market come at the price of having to maintain market dominance so that people can't just set up their market orders and go use their finances to spend all their time buying expensive ships to go kill people. there is actually a cost/benefit decision to be made with markets.as for 3, there are already several isk sinks involved in the market. every buy/sell order attracts a broker fee. every sale includes an scc tax. these costs need to be considered when buying selling stuff so that the market is a little more complex than buy at price x, sell at price y only where y > x -- it is still possible that if y > x you could actually make a loss, so the benefits of trading come with risks. all market transactions take money out of the game.tl;dr not supported - market works fine as it is."
5/13/2010,"qens that have come out in the past have said flatly that eve is on a long-term deflationary trend. analysis of the major market components agrees with this. a year ago, a raven(t1 market) was 87 mil in jita, now it's 76. a zealot(t2 market) was 120 mil, is now 93. t3 is a bit too recent for the one year ago number to be meaningful, but they've been on a steady downward trend since they were introduced. some items have gone up, but the overall trend is steady deflation. i don't know how well trained you are in economics, but here's a crash course on monetary policy. (effective money supply)/(effective goods supply) = price level. if prices go down, it means that money is getting rarer relative to goods. in other words, we need more isk sources or fewer isk sinks in order to get price stability. other mmos, with drop-based economic models that force everyone to the best possible goods do have an inflation problem. eve does not. asking for additional isk sinks in eve implies that either you do not understand economics or that you do not understand the eve market. are you kidding? i'm lazy as hell, my orders spend a lot of time tenth on the list in active markets. but i know that going in, and plan accordingly. i've watched a lot of orders in a lot of markets over the last year or so. there are some markets where the competition is absolutely furious - i put a couple billion a week through the jita mineral markets, for example. i'm lucky to have an order stay on top for the full five minutes there. but i've looked at the behaviour out of curiosity, and there's no signs of macros. it's just a heavily traded market, with a dozen people actively bumping at any given time. the only time i've ever had anything that even looked like a macro was one time buying salvage in a minor mission hub, but i convoed the guy, and he just had an egg timer running. had a nice chat with the fellow. i don't have any conclusive evidence, but i've gotten into this argument before and looked into it. i've never seen any signs that it's more than paranoid fantasy. it's too easy an activity to spot, and it has too low a margin compared to doing it the old-fashioned way."

5/13/2010,think hard before you vote for this candidate...you might login one day and ankh has turned the game into a turd which costs $15 a month to nibble on.
5/13/2010,"this is possibly the last person anyone should vote for. this candidate, and others like it, are the reason csm is fail.spam-mailing every mission hub in eden, with threats that other csm's will move their lvl 4 missions to lowsec"
5/13/2010,confirming my votes for the pirate wench.
5/13/2010,"and i said, what about breakfast at tiffany's?"
5/13/2010,exciting election to be sure!!!please vote!issler
5/13/2010,"i've got to say, after reading what you wrote about larkonis in the immediate aftermath of the great scandal, the last thing i'd have expected is for you to say that you thought he should have done a better job with the heist! can't say i agree with that pov, but i think at this point it's worth saying that, contrary to the editorial i wrote at the time, if i were a carebear i would definitely have to consider voting for issler. obviously as i'm a pvper she's not going to best represent my interests, so i'm not going to cast my vote for her (sorry!) but i honestly can't say that i'd mind having her on the council. lord knows everyone is entitled to get grumpy now and then, and i can't say issler didn't have good reason. i'll be posting a note on my original editorial from a few months ago to that effect."
5/13/2010,"wow, that is a very unexpected and gracious thing to have posted!thanks!issler dainzefaithful eve tribune reader"
5/13/2010,i think issler brings a valuable perspective to the csm; i hope we get to work together.
5/13/2010,just saw the campaing vid (link in op). can't believe it only has 250 views.. it's awesome. go see it now :)

5/13/2010,"well thank you for your questions :d i will gladly answer them.1. assuming we are playing the same game, our interests are aligned. ccp won't accept my ""give free titans to all alliances starting with p"" issue so the only thing that's left, are issues that both me and all alliances in 0.0 would agree upon, such as improving poses. i co-operated very well with every member of the csm in the csm3, even with the highsec, more carebear-y types2. you know i really have no good idea for this. i don't know if its a cultural thing(blue is for boys pink is for girls etc) or something else, but there is very little in eve that could be regarded as feminine or largely attractive to females. the already existing huge gender gap doesn't help things. if i hear any good ideas i'm all ears and completely behind it, but for now i really have no idea. also demographically speaking, this game appeals to 'older gamers' and 'gamers that like space ships', both groups are biased towards the male end of things. combine both, you end up with a huge sausagefest.3. i would definitely spend some time visiting the volcano. it is something i really want to do. i may also drop ccp into the volcano since it is probably somehow their fault if i am trapped there. i also want to go on a daytrip with some of my icelandic pl buddies.4. well since they have announced it, it will probably happen. it'll probably take the same form it took last time. i just hope there's a cap on potential rewards- so even if there is suspicion about favoritism, it doesn't spiral into a huge deal such as what happened during that mothership event so long ago. as for the lag issue, if it happens then ccp will have to reinforce the node beforehand just like what happens for fleet battles. as for accessibility, just making it many small events in random places should ensure that the maximum number of players can see an event happen at least once."
5/13/2010,"tldr: read this editorial, explaining why the eve tribune is asking you not to vote for ankhesentapemkah.long version:my fellow players, i feel that it is worth announcing here that the eve tribune, new eden's oldest and most established independent newspaper, has taken the extraordinary and for us unprecedented step of formally urging our readers not to vote for ankhesentapemkah for the csm. you can read my editorial setting out our case against her here. though due to the limitations of time and space i have dealt with only some of the very serious problems with ankh's record, we feel that the case we have laid out is simply too damning to even consider voting for this deeply flawed candidate. it is our considered opinion that ankh is morally and temperamentally unsuitable to sit on the council of stellar management. simply put, we believe that she is the worst candidate currently running. rest assured that this decision was taken after careful consideration with the tribune's management, and with full understanding of the importance of our role as independent reporters in the democratic process. again, we most sincerely urge all of our fellow players not to vote ankhesentapemkah. thank you for your time."
5/13/2010,i agree with you that ankhesentapemkah isnt a suitable candidate in my opinion. i do feel that you are biased. i am a pvper but i know very well that there are many many pilots who would tell you that for them eve online isnt about pvp and have no interest in it. that that is their choice.i feel that i should say that evas choice to list her volunteer work for ccp would in the uk not only be quite legitimate but also encouraged.
5/13/2010,"would it be encouraged to list that as actual employment, without specifying that it's par- time volunteering, or the elected nature of the position? also i don't oppose voting for other carebear candidates, and neither does the tribune. i personally won't vote for one since they won't represent my personal interests as an empire/lowsec pvper and i only have one account, but there are certainly highly-qualified carebears out there who i would love to see on the csm. edit: for instance, i personally would love to see omber zombie get elected again, everything i've heard is that he's a fantastically hard worker and has done a great job."
5/13/2010,"yes! i have looked at her cv and it is perfectly acceptable. she has listed her employer, job title and duties. volunteer work in the uk is actual employment."
5/13/2010,"biggest load of a steamin pile of crap ive ever read, change the bloody record, its a bloody cv not a official application form and tbh noone i know cares except for a few and a army of alts belonging to the other csmsankh''''''' is one csm out of quite a few - im sure if she suggested anything that isnt suitable in their and ccp's opinion then it wouldnt even be considered, items i have been reading lately seem to be written by a army of alts with personnal agenda's ive read her past suggestions and votes and she has voted in favour of a no' of items suggested by most other csm's, does that make those suggestions laughable because she cast her vote agreeing with them?you guys are embaressing"
5/13/2010,"i am tired of this bs.1 opinion is opinion and not fact.2 ccp decides if a candidate is qualified. if a candidate is not then they are not allowed to enter the race.- as to your editorials points3 term limits. yes, there is a down side to lifting them. just as there is a downside to having them in the first place. never the less with them lifted there is nothing wrong with running, even if you do not believe the term limits should not been lifted. so we have a pointless point in the end.4 the resum<U+FFFD> issue. who the flipping hell cares!!!! this does not matter one damn bit. her cv has nothing to do what so ever to do with her qualifications as csm. sure she brought it up, if you don't like it fine don't vote for her but, in ether case it is not important.5 anti-pvp. csm is a body made up of multiple members, each representing (ideally) a number of different perspectives and backgrounds. one member can not change the game. the csm can not change the game. the csm helps present and prioritize issues players have with the game. one member will not change the nature of eve or ccp. to think otherwise is folly, to put it nicely.my final comment....if you don't like ankhesentapemkah don't vote for her. it is that simple. all of these posts do one thing... draw attention to her candidacy. just remember, ""any publicity is good publicity."".oh, and htfu.thank you.ashina sitoedit: i apparently misread ankhesentapemkah's statement on this and she was refering to fanfest. so this section is factually incorrect. i am leaving it in since it was posted and just moving out of the main text. if ankhesentapemkah wishes i will delete this section.to be fair i do not have all love and roses for ankhesentapemkah's viewpoints. she has expressed the desire to remove the covering of the expenses for csm members to go to the iceland summit. i do not like this. i will already be expending several thousands of dollars in lost wages (my job has no vacation days) and airfare. ccp pays for flights to iceland on icelandic air, i live in southern california. i will have to fly to ether seattle or nyc out of pocket to catch an icelandic air flight to iceland. i would already be taking one for the team enough with my finances, to pay for the entire trip would be untenable. at least i could crash on the couch of some i know in iceland. my parents had an icelandic foreign exchange student and i am sure he would loan me his couch for a week."
5/13/2010,"i dont give a rats behind about the cv thing - employers should check relevant references in any case.however, i dont understand how anyone would support someone who would stoop so low as to abuse the parent of a disabled child and blame them for causing the disability. candidly, i think that's on a par with or maybe even worse than racial abuse, which is something that even the ""socipathic bullies"" who make up the pvp community in eve have never tolerated.i've disagreed with eva on a number of game related issues, but that revealing little display of viciousness puts her beyond the pale as a person."
5/13/2010,"you guys are an embarrassment for independent journalism. have you contacted ankh to see what she had to say?her thread is trolled, and the comments you are quoting are outdated, most of them date back before ankh has even been on the csm, and during a time where there indeed was no consequence for suicide ganking (there were tactics to avoid getting a secloss alltogether!) and concord took ages to show up. your article is horribly one-sided and most of your so-called facts are simply wrong. which candidate paid you to post this crap?plus, being from the netherlands and being owner of a small business, i can attest that ankh's cv is perfectly fine."
5/13/2010,"ok, i've heard from a few europeans now that ankh's cv is fine. perhaps this is because i'm an american, but as a general rule we don't cite part-time volunteer experience as part of the employment history, but rather as part of a miscellaneous experience section. so my first problem in particular with that entry is that it suggests that it was a full-time job, not part-time volunteer work. this appears inaccurate, but i can see how there might be different conventions in europe. if i can get more confirmation that things are done differently on the other side of the pond, and dutch/european cvs include part-time volunteer work as part of the employment section without some kind of differentiation, as ankh does, then i'll gladly post a correction.my second problem, which perhaps i should have made more clear, is that ankh was not hired by ccp--i.e., the award-winning company which has developed a highly successful mmo--but rather elected by the player base--i.e., people who pretend to fly internet spaceships. this strikes me as fundamentally misleading, and something that cannot be easily explained away by different cultural conventions for cvs."
5/13/2010,"no hearing, no double checking, quoting stuff that has already been disproven even in the thread itself?i have seen gossip columnists do better.by the way what's up with the people from razor alliance you've been in close contact with about this? how much did they pay you?"
5/13/2010,"for the record, i believe ankh is referring here to the tribune's editor-in-chief, finnagain zero."
5/13/2010,"while i agree with the fundamental message, all i found in the article was a tl;dr of a forum thread and some potshots at eve, ccp, and aspects of the game i happen to quite enjoy.sounds like a whiny pvper."
5/13/2010,"i find it funny that the first two paragraphs are basically an apology to the reader that publishing trasharticles like these are the wrong thing to do, and attempt to spin thin justifications for doing it anyway.everything you claim in this article is wrong:the things she put in her cv are not only perfectly acceptable, they are also totally irrelevant to her bid for csm. the only reason it is in her thread is because her opponents use it to fling mud (with the alts of the opponents then trying to make mountains out of this non-issue)the thing about uos justice system have been clarified several times in the topic, but the trolls keep bringing it up and ignoring the clarifications, as did you.like kuliskitur said, ankh's quotes about unfair suicide ganking date back from before the suicide gank nerf, and even ccp agreed that the suicide ganking mechanics were not balanced at that time. funny, as ccp even states its intention to remove insurance from concord-related events. the most ironic part is that ankh didn't ask for these measures. she asked for player-driven justice, aka pvp means to deal with it.ankh has stated clearly that she is pro-pvp, small-gang warfare and factional warfare being mentioned throughout the years as areas in need of improvement.ankh not responding well to criticism? as you can see, she remains relatively calm and polite despite all the bull****, flaming and trolling going on. as seen from prior campaign threads, if ankh would keep responding, it would just degenerate into a flame-war. the trolls do not read nor care about the answers she gives, as displayed clearly in the start of the thread where there is clear selective quoting and twisting of her statements by her opponents. i applaud it that ankh ignores the trolls and remains constructive under the circumstances.chatlogs: could as well be fabrications, some people have already pointed out errors in several of them, and ankh denied the authenticy of at least one of them.good job throwing your credibility and that of eve tribune out of the window by using a troll thread as only source and not conducting proper hearing nor doing your own research."
5/13/2010,"where did you get that from?i said ccp should not pay the fanfest tickets, of course they should be paying the csm summit expenses."
5/13/2010,"well, looks like all the hate failed."
5/13/2010,*gets popcorn**sits comfortably*
5/13/2010,"ankh got - mainly due to the bull**** that is happened on this forum - 7 votes from me.i guess you pvplers can't stand a person, who speaks and stands up for the producers, miners, traders as well? so you have to spread lies and rumors?cheap, really cheap propaganda. eve tribune = epic fail."
5/13/2010,"qftnow, thanks to all this dirt being lifted, i am actually voting for ankhesentapemkah with my alt. did you get what you wanted now? how do you like that, huh?it's not pvpers- i am a pvper, and i would still like them, say, improving missions or mining. it just politics- people throwing dirt at each-other.tribune - is only one ****ing reason anyone has a cv in the first place, that is to get employed, and get a good job. we are all guilty of those motives. and i do not give a crap about the cv. how i don't give a crap about tribune either."
5/13/2010,"heh, dude, aren't you attending for csm as well? are you that desperate, that you have to troll some misinforming anti-propaganda thread?that's 11 more votes for ankh by me and my familly.go, ankh, go!!"
5/13/2010,and 8 from me. thanks for all the comedy.o7
5/13/2010,"] ankhesentapemkah > i'm just sick of this bull**** gamenow to be fair i think the eve-tribune is utterly full of ****. then again..so are you so it seems all works out well in the end dontcha think? balance and all that.and by the way....your inability to comment regarding:1-your belonging to a pvp alliance and never participating beyond raging when caught in yet another ****-fit domi and popped.2-your complete inexperience regarding pvp mechanics, sov mechanics, ship fitting, etc3-your stated belief that something called puzzle pirates>eve4-your stated beleif that ""eve is a bull**** game""etc etc etc etcdoes not equate to ""disproven"" hon p.s. do dutch jails serve free spliffs?"
5/13/2010,this carebear persecution complex is fascinating. ankh did well to capitalise on it.
5/13/2010,"shouting ""irrelevant"" is not disproving anything. i'd like to point out that you haven't even denied any of the logs posted by myself and others of your time in afc. i'll also invite anyone that thinks i'm a forum alt or related to another candidate or just an annoyed pvp'er to check out my info in game. you'll see i was indeed alongside ankh in afc, that i'm not much of a pvp'er (i flew in cva for a while after all ) and have an honestly fairly poor set of battleclinic stats, but i also have experience with pos operations, logistics and mission running as can be seen from my standings. i don't particularly care who amongst the other candidates gets onto the csm, i just feel ankh is the worst possible person to represent eve from all those available. i've said it before and i'll say it again, i'd rather have my toaster on the csm than her. at least it wouldn't be quite so dishonest and hostile to what eve is."
5/13/2010,"why should they profit on that? (or maybe ankh instead) whoever made this anti ankh article, txs for the nice place for my adv."
5/13/2010,"it isnt easy for me to explain the differences between american and european employment on this forum without a very long post but what i can do is point out to you a few things that may make it clearer to you.firstly uk cvs wouldnt normally have a miscellaneous experience section. a uk employer would actually expect volunteer or part time work to be listed as your employment history.secondly it would be expected although not mandatory for your cv to be accompanied with a covering letter.if you downloaded the pdf from her website you will note that there are 4 pages. 2 pages are the cv and 2 are the covering letter. if you read the covering letter. she states i have been elected council member of eve onlines council of stellar management. she continues to explain what was involved.attending an interview in the uk your cv and covering letter would be discussed. issues like pay, duties, work hours and contract agreements would be discussed for both the job you are attending the interview for and your previous employment.if eva was from the uk ccp would be considered a previous employer. i am not from the netherlands but as far as i can see she has said nothing misleading at all in her employment application."
5/13/2010,"in the netherlands, a cv usually only has these sections:- personal/contact information- work experience- education- misc skills / hobbies / interestssee intermediar.nl for examples.it is often stongly encouraged to fit your cv on a single page or two pages at most (and then print it on the front and back, which is very important when looking for a job, so you can hand it over immediately when asked and carry several copies with you at all times), thus having more sections isn't practical. relevant volunteer work clearly belongs to the work experience section, in particular if it was your main work-related activity at that time.in addition to that is a covering letter that provides more details about your prior activities and what you learned from them. it is also used to explain why you want to work for company x and what you want out of a job (while the covering letter is usually changed based on the company you apply for, eva has a generic one on her site)did you bother doing some actual research here, like any independent reporter should, or did you just listen to the trolls? the covering letter explains exactly what it is and what she did there.and under dutch law, eva has been an 'unpaid employee', for which a contract of employment is not a requirement.most of the other accusations in the article are equally unfounded. i think the only unfit person here is you, miyamoto. unfit for the position of reporter, that is."
5/13/2010,"the vast majority of everything that's cited in the article are your own words posted by you on the eve forums. your only possible counter-arguments are to one point where miya stated that you ""appear"" to believe something (that hasn't been disproven so much as challenged) and one other post at kugu. everything else is you, posting here. if you can actually prove that either of those comments were false you're welcome to email such evidence to the tribune and we'll take a look at it. but denial is not rebuttal. european or american, putting down working at the csm as if it was employment in the video games industry is deceptive and misleading. as part of the csm she does not handle ""game design"". she is not a dev. csm members make non-binding suggestions to ccp, the same as any player posting on the forums but the csm has a bit more clout. the csm advises ccp, and they then choose to either accept or reject suggestions and how to implement them. casting the csm as a dev's position is misleading, at best. ""served as liaison between player base and developers"" is accurate. ""game design, game mechanics analysis, documentation"" is not unless she was hired on as a dev and/or wrote their documentation hers."
5/13/2010,it's almost like rl politics!
5/13/2010,"selective quoting ftw. no-where in this article are eva's counterarguments presented. the article only presents arguments in favor of the claim that ankh is unfit and what not, while there is plenty of material everywhere that proves the contrary. there is plenty of rebuttal in the thread itself, and also in previous campaign threads of her (cause this isn't the first time all this crap has been brought up) which simply is not included in the article. there are half a dozen posts in which eva counters the ""uo justice"" whining. the article refers to the ""uo justice"" thingie, but never makes any mention of the clarifications. the article is one big pile of libel, bias and even some outright falsehoods.nowhere is she claiming she was a dev, go go strawman tactics! and see the two posts above your own for proof that it is not normal, but in fact encouraged to write the cv in the manner she did. selective reading, eh? and this calls himself an editor?"
5/13/2010,"so sure they're her quotes, in her own words, expressing her own views... but can't we at least ignore them?congratulations, you understand the concept of an editorial arguing against a candidate. so in other words it was 100% accurate, but if someone later tries to retract their statement and change it with ""but what i really meant was..."" then the facts are no longer facts and they've been rebutted. i think that's known as the mel gibson gambit. i don't think things work that way. i've noted that quite a few of you who have taken to supporting ank do so with this blatantly fictional stuff. it is interesting that you folks feel that the truth won't do to support your claims. when someone puts down ""game development"" on their cv as a function of a job, it implies, get this, that job included game development. that is, that they were acting as a developer. of course, by your denial here i trust you're agreeing that she wasn't really developing anything for ccp and shouldn't have claimed that she acting as a developer in her role as player liaison. progress is being made."
5/13/2010,"i agree, that's terrible. what an awful person. why are people actually trying to defend this spiteful, pretentious, useless individual? are they alts?"
5/13/2010,"it is not deceptive. it is not misleading. the cv & covering letter is for a prospective employer. eva described her duties. she also gave contact information for ccp games who would be quite willing for verify what she had done.it is very clear that her job as a csm fills game design, game mechanics analyisis & documentation. her job as csm would mean she would need to talk to developers about game design and game mechanics and to document that. she is not misleading anyone by saying that.if this was the only thing in her cv and covering letter it might be misleading. since she covered what that meant in her covering letter and provided a reference for her duties she was not being misleading.the truth is right there in her cv and covering letter. anyone reading this thread can take a look if they so wished. they will see for themselves that she is not misleading anyone. i do not consider your failure to understand a simple cv and covering letter as evidence to the contrary."
5/13/2010,"yes, it is. she did not serve as a dev. the fact that she gave a contact to verify that does not change the fact that it wasn't true in the first place. if the csm are devs, then anybody who posts suggestions on the forums are also engaged in ""game development""."
5/13/2010,"no it isn't. you are replying as if she called herself a ""dev"". at no time on her cv or covering letter did she do that."
5/13/2010,"see, if you can't even get the very basic facts straight, what does the rest of your rant mean?if someone says they engaged in ""game design"", they're saying they were, get this, designing a game. that's what a dev does. again, by your rationalizations anybody who posts any advice for the game on the forums is a ""game designer"". this shows the quality of your argument."
5/13/2010,"you cant get the basic facts right can you? she did not say she was engaged in ""game design you are the only one saying that. the words game design are mentioned on her cv. this doesnt mean she is calling herself a game designer or a game developer. you are the only one saying that.there is no way my rationalizations would mean anyone who posts any advice for the game on these forums is a game designer. you are the only one saying that.the fact remains that eva at no point said she was a game designer or ""game developer"" for ccp. you are the only one saying that.you have no argument at all."
5/13/2010,"again, the fact that you're reduced to such obvious dishonesty and you can't even stick to the basic facts that are in black and white kind of shows what your argument is about. you are now honestly claiming that when she says that her work on the csm included ""game design"" that she wasn't really saying she was engaged in ""game design"". who do you think you're fooling, exactly? just to point out your deception here:if you can't even keep your deceptions straight from one paragraph to another....and yes, someone who engages in game design is a game designer. isn't it just strange how that works? the fact that you are arguing against your own logic just shows the quality of that logic. if ank is engaged in ""game design"" by making suggestions to ccp, so is everybody who does it on the forums. but you claim that they're obviously not but she's not being dishonest when she claims the exact, same, thing. the sheer amount of dishonesty ank's fans have used says all that needs to be said."
5/13/2010,..
5/13/2010,i am not dishonest. you are just wrong.the fact still remains she did not call herself a dev at anytime on her cv or covering letter.
5/13/2010,you might want to change that from now on.a newspaper is purely for covering the news on an unbiased base. by urging people in a very distinctive way to vote in a certain way you just lost your newspaper worthyness and aren't anything more than a propaganda machine for a party or against a party.if you just post all the facts and then let people decide for themselves you would have been a newspaper. by this action you clearly pointed out that you are not about covering the news but are also about making the news which is far from what real journalism is about.
5/13/2010,"umm, thanks i think?i'm happy to be interviewed any time you like, omberozombero|@|gmail.com (remove the |'s obviously)"
5/13/2010,"have you ever considered learning what you're talking about before you make claims? newspapers have had editorials for quite some time, and the ny times is hardly 'no longer a newspaper' if they endorse a candidate."
5/13/2010,"funny,all the big badass pvplers come out together with all of the pvp orientated ""cool"" csm kids and cry about a person who wants to make eve a better game for *both* the pve players ind empire *and* the pvp people.and all that is sponsored by some so called ""eve magazine"", a propaganda tool for all the cool gankers and gate campers?i wouldn't vote on some csms (=korvin) comming ot this thread and whining about a competing candidate. epic fail there."
5/13/2010,"no, that's the point. ank doesn't understand eve, doesn't grok what makes it good, and her ideas would hurt the game for everybody. yes yes, there's an elaborate conspiracy. against you. hide!"
5/13/2010,"ow i know exactly what i am talking about. editorials are pieces in a newspaper which give a certain journalist or columnist a spot to point out their point of vieuw, this however isn't the point of vieuw of the newspaper.and no the ny times isn't exactly an example of a newspaper when it started to take sides. offcourse people will argue about it. but one of the first things a real journalist and editor learns is that the newscoverage should be unbiased and open.what path they chose afterwards is a whole other story, but you can check with any real reputable journalist that being unbiased in newscoery is the keystone in journalism.as soon as the unbiased newscoverage is hapered with the journalist, editor or newspaper loses the keypart of it's credebility. mainly due to the fact that you can start doubleguessing any coverage in a certain direction as being partially build up on biased assumptions and blowing out of proportion or smoothed down if it's something they favoured for in the passt."
5/13/2010,"again, learn what you're talking about. newspapers endorse candidates and argue against candidates all the time. in each and every single election cycle. every newspaper endorses candidates come election time. it's okay if you support ank, but these silly rationalized attacks are just laughable. your back-of-a-cereal-box-wisdom is not impressive. but you're more than welcome to find reputable ombudsmen sanctioning newspapers for making endorsements. knock yourself out."
5/13/2010,"oops, i guess i misread your post. would you like a blanket removal of the comment or an leave it up with an edit? (i am gonna edit it atm.)"
5/13/2010,"you can troll as much as you want, you are clearly not a newspaper but a supporttool for a certain direction which clearly makes you nothing more than a propaganda tool.ow and if you want some reputable ombudsmen or women to give their opinion about this i will dig up some and guess what, then you will start to nag they aren't reputable since they aren't the ones you deem to be reputable.the states have this amendment which guarantees freedom of speech so ofcourse it's impossible to sanction newspapers for being a biased bunch of people rooting for one side and making offbalance reports.as long as they don't lie it's fine, it's not asif you can fine them for only ""discovering""half the truth and then defending the fact they do a biased newscovery by hiding behind all kinds of judicional crap.it's fine, but don't try to rebottle with what certain newspapers do that clearly are funded in some way by a side and as such have to adjust their ""newscoverage"" which in turn has nothing to do with pure journalism.endorsing a candidate is a whole other ballpark than calling to not vote for someone else by highlighting certain parts and not all of it so it fit's your propaganda.it just makes your candidate look insecure of his own merits."
5/13/2010,"and just for you to have a thourough read.failing to uphold standardssuch a code of conduct can, in the real world, be difficult to uphold consistently. journalists who believe they are being fair or objective may give biased accountsby reporting selectively, trusting too much to anecdote, or giving a partial explanation of actions. (see media bias.) even in routine reporting, bias can creep into a story through a reporter's choice of facts to summarize, or through failure to check enough sources, hear and report dissenting voices, or seek fresh perspectives.a news organization's budget inevitably reflects decision-making about what news to cover, for what audience, and in what depth. those decisions may reflect conscious or unconscious bias. when budgets are cut, editors may sacrifice reporters in distant news bureaus, reduce the number of staff assigned to low-income areas, or wipe entire communities from the publication's zone of interest.publishers, owners and other corporate executives, especially advertising sales executives, can try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published. journalists usually rely on top management to create and maintain a ""firewall"" between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department. one journalism magazine, columbia journalism review, has made it a practice to reveal examples of executives who try to influence news coverage, of executives who do not abuse their powers over journalists, and of journalists who resist such pressures.self-censorship is a growing problem in journalism, particularly in covering countries that sharply restrict press freedom. as commercial pressure in the media marketplace grows, media organizations are loath to lose access to high-profile countries by producing unflattering stories. for example, cnn admitted that it had practiced self-censorship in covering the ****** ******* regime in iraq in order to ensure continued access after the regime had thrown out other media. cnn correspondent christiane amanpour also complained of self-censorship during the invasion of iraq due to the fear of alienating key audiences in the us. there are claims that the media are also avoiding covering stories about repression and human rights violations by the israeli and iranian regimes in order to maintain a presence in those countries.reporting versus editorializinggenerally, publishers and consumers of journalism draw a distinction between reporting  ""just the facts""  and opinion writing, often by restricting opinion columns to the editorial page and its facing or ""op-ed"" (opposite the editorials) page. unsigned editorials are traditionally the official opinions of the paper's editorial board, while op-ed pages may be a mixture of syndicated columns and other contributions, frequently with some attempt to balance the voices across some political or social spectrum.the distinction between reporting and opinion can break down. in the uk, the press complaints commission states that ""the press, whilst free to be partisan, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact"" but some commentators have suggested there can sometimes be a blurring of opinion and fact. complex stories often require summarizing and interpretation of facts, especially if there is limited time or space for a story. stories involving great amounts of interpretation are often labelled ""news analysis,"" but still run in a paper's news columns. the limited time for each story in a broadcast report rarely allows for such distinctions."
5/13/2010,"pathetic. you just vomited up a bunch of text that has nothing to do with papers endorsing candidates. how hard is it to figure out wtf you're talking about before you say stuff?ahhh, you're hitting all the dodges. anybody who points out the facts must be a troll, because only trolls use facts and anybody who disagrees with you mus be part of an evil propaganda conspiracy. huzzah. you won't be able to because you're making stuff up as fast as you can type. but good preemptive dodge on that one too. again you're making stuff up as fast as you can type. that's an ombudsman's job. again, discover what you're talking about before you talk about it. when you have an election that is a zero-sum game, saying that you should only vote for one gay means that everybody else shouldn't be voted for and thus, not elected. if a newspaper says ""vote for candidate a for president, not candidate b"" guess who they've just argued you should not vote for?"
5/13/2010,i understand that this is mistake on your part but if this mistake was printed in a newspaper your career would be over. what does that say about you?
5/13/2010,"eve tribune. now propaganda machine for 0.0 pvp alliances.in a desperate attempt to take wind out of ankhesentapemkah's sails the eve tribune, once a reputable newspaper, has dropped from it's unbiased journalism and has started to openly chose sides.it is still unclear what drove this former newspaper to such action but it surely has thrown a dark blemish on what once was a newsgathering newspaper.ethical and moral standards of journalism thrown off it has chosen to do a frontal attack towards ankhesentapemkah in an attempt to discourage people to chose this csm candidate.might this be due to financial or other bonds with some people in razor alliance which franticly is trying to convince people that this is still legitimate journalism?or are there more powers in the north trying to smear another csm's run for the csm?this makes one wonder, when looking at all the forum threads and responces in them, why people are so afraid of this ankhesentapemkah getting into the csm that they have to pull out every gun at their disposal to make her candidacy as hard as possible.i myself am not convinced ankhesentapemkah is the most suitable candidate, but she clearly is the one with the highest profile.my suggestion is that people read what each candidate stands for and looks for the one who suits them most and votes for said candidate.if the candidae doesn't uphold as he or she promoted then the election base can write to ccp and ask for clarification of ccp and if needed a formal petition of the playerbase for removal of said candidate for running under false pretences."
5/13/2010,"funny story - the quotes about how suicide gankers are evil and need to be driven out of empire entirely do date from before the nerf, but one would assume that the nerf would hardly be sufficient to satisfy someone with such extreme positions. however, even after the nerf - as recently as this campaign, in fact - she's made comments about how suicide ganking needs significant further nerfing. it's on the first page of her campaign thread, for example. in other words, the nerf hasn't satisfied her. so what you're saying is that an editorial in a newspaper is picking a side of the debate and advocating for it? why, if you ignore the last four centuries of newspaper publishing, that's almost shocking. find me any pvper knowledgeable about the csm who has bad things to say about omber zombie, lavista vista, or z0d - three past ""carebear"" reps that actually have a clue. nobody is opposed to the non-combat parts of the game being improved. people are opposed to someone who seemingly misunderstands and resents the pvp parts of the game. she listed game development as a job responsibility. that would make her a game developer. what do you think ""dev"" is an abbreviation for? have you ever actually read the sort of newspaper that comes on actual paper? past the third page, i mean.presumably, it says that he writes for a newspaper that doesn't keep multiple proofreaders as full-time paid staff."
5/13/2010,"heh. i am interested in the logic here though. i had a typo and right clicked to fix it without checking closely and clicked the wrong word. therefore, papers fire people who write typos. therefore, it really shows something important about me. i don't know why ank's supporters can't just say ""yeah, she's said a whole lot of stuff that shows she doesn't understand eve and would harm the game and she's highly offensive to those people who engage in the content that ccp promotes as its end-game material... but we like her anyways."" i doubt anybody would have a problem with that (much). but ""troll troll troll!"" doesn't cut it. although one nitpick, ank defined her job duties as ""game design"" and technically not ""game development"", but they're synonyms and she wasn't involved in either let alone as a job duty. you folks are hilarious. although this new tempest in a tea pot about a mistaken right click to fix a red lined word does say a bit about you. this thread is turning into pure comedy gold. can i hear some more about journalistic standards?"
5/13/2010,it says that he's not a guy who supports someone who abuses the mother of a disabled child.
5/13/2010,"by the way, can i get a cite for that? if it's true it belongs in the article."
5/13/2010,"whoa we're a mouthpiece for razor now? finn, does that mean i get a raise?itt: people complaining that a newspaper editorial expressed an opinion, and that that opinion was biased.in other news, i am shocked--shocked!--to find that gambling is going on in"
5/13/2010,"by the way, can i get a cite for that? if it's true it belongs in the article. funny, aint it? we're not just a mouthpiece of rzr, but evidently all 0.0 alliances, because we all know that they speak with a unified voice. it's interesting, as this is a milestone in the history of the tribune. people used to accuse us of being puppets of this alliance or that alliance, but now we're evidently puppets of all of 0.0, in toto. and no, all those tech moons are mine.p.s. even funnier, not only have we not endorsed the rzr csm candidate, but we haven't even interviewed him. that just shows how beholden we are to rzr's views on the csm."
5/13/2010,"bottom of this, and top of the next post. insert standard disclaimer about how chatlogs may be forged, etc. but near as i can tell ankh never denied making that statement. her only response (that i found) was the following:"
5/13/2010,[19:30:50] ankhesentapemkah > i'l looking at a lawsuit to eve tribune now tbh.
5/13/2010,ahahahahah.
5/13/2010,bump so everyone will know the truth about this candidatevote for ankhesentapemkah = ruin the game we all know and love!!
5/13/2010,"eve tribune writers have bias, it's unavoidable really. we also get accused of far more bias than we really have, but that's a different story! that bias is why we have always offered anyone who disagrees with one of our articles the opportunity to write a counterpoint. (obviously with the understanding that they need to raise genuine points/demonstrate sources/be reasonably well written/etc). that will be published and the person who writes it will be paid at the same rates as our writers.that offer has never been taken up.when offering interviews to all csm candidates (which will still include ankh should she decide to run for future csms and be willing to be interviewed - which i will fully understand if she does not) i try to be as neutral/positive as possible. in fact you can see my interview with her in last week's issue.other writers though are also free to hold and expose their own opinions, and in this case the majority of our editorial staff agreed with the opinion of the writer so it has also been adopted as the tribune's position.anyone expecting impartiality from newspapers has clearly never read one. we just finished an election in the uk and the level of bias in our papers was incredible. it's human nature when you believe something to try and get others to believe it too."
5/13/2010,"i wanted to go on the record as confirming that this is true. some ""interesting"" comments were made about me in the context of ""larkgate"". i was contacted and offered an opportunity to offer any sort of rebutal i thought was appropriate in response. i started to respond, had some rl distractions and by the time i could get back to it i realized i'd just as soon let the whole matter pass.i have no doubt that the ""tribune"" would be glad to offer ank a chance to respond to the editorial. if she is upset i think she'd be better off exploring the possibility of creating a clever and insightful rebutal to the editorial instead of insinuating she is pursuing the possibility of justice in the dutch courts. (/me wonders if the trial would be held in jita)the eve tribune is an amazing resource to the eve comminity. an editorial related to csm elections seems totally consistent with what i would expect from our best ""space paper"".i can understand how someone that supports ank might dissagree with the editorial but how they can then twist that into an attack on the tribune's integrity eludes me. to the folks that complain that this editorial somehow is inconsistent with a great newspaper all i can say is ""what about political editorials in a newspaper"" do you not undertand?issler dainzejust renewed her virtual subscription to the eve tribune for life!"
5/13/2010,"yep. i already offered, in this thread, to retract anything that ank can actually show is untrue. it seems unlikely, as all the quotes were either from ank's own posts on eve-o or from chats whose participants have verified their accuracy. at best it seems that her response might be along the lines of her fans'.that being said, if ank can actually muster a cogent, coherent response we'll be happy to publish it and pay her for her time. doesn't seem likely though."
5/13/2010,"eve tribune is indeed a great resource for the eve community. nevertheless this article was horrible. (i gave more of an analysis of why the article stunk in the comment section of the article itself. and no i do not like ank.) eve trib is great for articles on game mechanics, tactics and strategy. but often the writers disdain for eve pilots who do things other than pvp is a bit overbearing."
5/13/2010,"while i think csm is a sham, if there is one single candidate that you should not vote for, it is most definatly ankhesentapemkah.not only because she's probably born in kenya, but also because of the pure sleazy methods she has used to harvest votes.telling mission runners that voting for her would stop lvl4 missions being moved to lowsec, for example."
5/13/2010,"happy to confirm that the chat logs are accurate. sadly i don't have the originals, just what i copied into an email, however everything from when ankh first spoke in corp chat to when the conversation turned back to a discussion of the sorry state of the cva jump bridge network is there. feel free to pm me in game if you need further info."
5/13/2010,"aliariami just wanted to say that although i don't think eve trib did a good job on this article that doesn't mean i think what ank said was in any way acceptable. it was completly out of line and standing alone is good enough reason to not vote for her. i think it indeed shows she does not care about the people flying the pixel ships, and given her claims in that regard, that is really eyeopening. i hope you don't let people who make comments like that get you down, and i wish you the best."
5/13/2010,"before i vote i do have a question to every csm i am interested in. i feel that the imbalances in the game is the piracy. the griefers and spammers. now i don't like anyone who does anything that would be considered as cheating. a customizable ui would allow possibilities of more bots. while i know there are quite a few bot programs for eve most of them would probably be slow, clunky and odd. a customizable ui would allow it so bots would be easier to make and use. how do you propose to help ccp see alternatives to this one major problem i am sure ccp sees. it was one of the things that lead to the downfall of wow. the second thing that lead to wow's downfall was eve.i don't care if you all call me a carebear or not. there are too many douchebags that cause the game to be less fun because they are griefed, jihaded etc. i agree space is a dangerous place, but i think the biggest imbalance is there is too many criminals without any form of law enforcement other than concord and a few hard coded rules. i feel that a player run law enforcement entity would be a good idea. clean up the bounty system, add a couple of skills that help tracking down specific players easily. i feel that in itself will balance out a lot of the imbalances these douchebag players actually create. eve is not a sand box it is either you are a pirate or you are dead. one griefer told me there is no such thing as negative consequences to griefing in high sec. i feel that is wrong. i feel atleast if you suicide gank someone if that player is in a corp everyone in that corp should have kill rights on that player for 24-48 hrs. yea sure most players use this game to relax, but honestly? i would like to see more punsihment for the pirates. more of a player run ccp endorsed form of law enforcement. i am not talking about gm rights. i am talking about space cops..i would love to be a space pig...have an npc dispatcher and your mission is to take out criminals who come into empire. (negative security standing players in .1 and above) would you endorse space pigs? why or why not?"
5/13/2010,"to those picking apart trebor's particular ideas that are based upon speculation, without any argument besides that...well, i find that a bit silly. they're not 'end all be all' sorts of ideas, but ideas based off of what he can assume and guess at in terms of the programming and back end. it feels to me as if they're samples/examples, if you will, which is quite fine.in any case, i do have a question for you, myself. one problem that occurred with varied add-ons in wow (and in fact took several years to solve, and keeps popping up every now and again) is that some particular ones ended up putting quite a load on the server themselves. some, for example, made extensive and heavy use of private channels and sending/receiving information between one's entire guild. eventually, some functions that been utilized for this were disabled...but the problem existed for some time. (and in most cases, admittedly, it was causing client-side lag for those in large guilds using such programs, as opposed to a strain on the server itself) this leads me to the question, however - between lag and the ui, which is the one you will throw the most weight behind, that you feel you might be able to most effect in a term as a csm member? as is known and been mentioned, both are relatively tough problems to work on, as far along as the game is."
5/13/2010,"i know that it's our duty as eve players to have a massive inferiority complex where world of warcraft is concerned, and to bash it at every opportunity. and hey, it's a game that deserves some bashing - i played it for an hour, and came to the conclusion that it was diablo with a subscription fee. but this is just patent lunacy. wow has thirty times the subscriber base of eve. saying that eve killed it is like saying that betamax killed the dvd."
5/13/2010,"currently eve has a better system and is more engaging to those that don't want to feel like they are in a bad 80's cartoon. unfortunately i have adhd so sometimes i don't type my complete thought. i also skip around when i do that..i didn't mean eve killed wow overall because there will always be fanboys of starcraft, warcraft, and diablo. but for me eve killed wow."
5/13/2010,"argh! server borked when i posted, and i forgot to copy the text. hours of careful cogitation and eloquent argument lost! now you just get the cliff-notes version.i address this issue directly in the tl;dr manifesto, but in brief, a public repository with revokable addons largely mitigates the ""makes bots easier"" and ""secret i win button"" issues.in order for a proposal to gain any traction, imho it needs to (a) actually fix the problem you're trying to fix, (b) not remove a gameplay option that the devs have clearly stated is a core part of the game (that, in eve, you have a inalienable right to be a total douchebag), and (c) be as easy to implement as possible -- or more precisely, have the most bang per dev-hour expended.i think you have a lot of work to do before you will have a proposal that meets those criteria.conversely, there is a proposal floating around to revoke insurance payouts when you get concorded. it (a) increases the costs of being a flaming douchebag, (b) still permits douchebaggery, and (c) would probably be quite easy to implement. i'm not entirely convinced it is the right way to go (especially since we'll have to see what effect the upcoming changes in insurance will have), but it's worthy of serious consideration.it wouldn't stop hulkageddon, but then i think stuff like that is part of what gives eve its twisted charm."
5/13/2010,"well, obviously some thought would have to be given to the kinds of things addons can do (such as posting to chat channels). there will no doubt be some issues that crop up. like anything else, it's a cost/benefit calculation -- are the overall benefits (to the players) worth the occasional fires that the devs need to put out?the honest answer is that nobody who is not on csm (and under nda) and briefed by ccp can give an honest answer to that question. however, here's my current opinion:lag is the near-term issue, and the ui is the long-term issue. as everyone should know because they've read the oft-mentioned tl;dr manifesto, i think the solution to lag in the long-term (even though it's the near-term issue, grin) is gameplay changes. if i get on csm, i'm going to hopefully get a better idea of the parameter-space of potential changes, and within the limits of the nda, want to encourage a serious public discussion of what's possible.the ui is going to take longer to address. it is almost certainly a much larger project than lag-related gameplay changes, and so it's going to take more work to make the case to ccp that its in their interests to do it.so in all honesty, within the scope of a single csm term, lag is the higher priority."
5/13/2010,"i appreciate the good words. you have singled out what i find to be key and unique to my campaign, i'm glad it hasn't been buried by :words:"
5/13/2010,"i've been noticing lately that ccp have been more open with us in a few regards, and that's great. a trend i would like to see grow and continue. i think there are game balance issues, of course. there are lots of things i don't have first hand experience of, such as being in a large nullsec alliance or flying capital ships. what affects me does not necesarily affect a large number of people, so i've decided to stay away from targeting any of my own opinions with respect to balance. if i were to force issues such as those, it would probably be done selfishly and i don't want to do that. my opinion on the new expansion is not yet fully formed. it's something more than we have already, so that's great. the implementation and effects remain to be seen, so i will reserve judgement for now. :)"
5/13/2010,friendly bump 0/
5/13/2010,i am all for boosting low sec. i welcome anyone who is interested in ideas to boost low sec. i am not happy with your thoughts on high sec.you must understand that many pilots in 0.0 fund their shiny pvp ships from high sec activities right? many of them would not welcome their income being nerfed. what do you think a high sec mission runner would do if their isk earn per hour was reduced? they would think great now i will have to run missions for longer today.players who are not interested in going to low sec or 0.0 will simply not go there and will not be forced in by any means. buff low sec by all means i would welcome it but not at the expense of players who are simply not interested.
5/13/2010,i'm inclined to agree. the way to solve the problem is to buff the rewards in low and nullsec so that they are commensurate with the risks.
5/13/2010,"yes, i perfectly understand, that there is lots of 0.0 players, who earn their money by running highsec missions. and that's the problem. highsec activities(except for trading) shouldn't be so profitable. nullsec dwellers should earn money they need for pvp in their regions and if they are not doing so, then something is wrong with the game design."
5/13/2010,i believe that its pilots choice how they make their isk. if they want to make their isk in high sec then so be it. i do not want my income to be interfered with because someone feels i shouldnt. if you feel that 0.0 isk isnt profitable enough in comparison to high sec earned isk then why not boost the isk earned in 0.0 rather than try to nerf high sec earned isk?
5/13/2010,"anomalies in nullsec are more profitable than empire missions. still many people prefer to run missions in highsec, because they offer comparable rewards with zero hassle. yeah, it will be difficult to nerf highsec missions now, because many generations of highsec dweller take their high income for granted. but it should be done for consistency. highsec exploration isn't even close as profitable as lowsec/nullsec. mining in highsec doesn't give you income comparable to nullsec miners. even production in nullsec offers greater rewards(of course demand is lower than in empire). and highsec mission runner has no need to fear anybody, except maybe some rare wardec. suicide ganking mission runner's ship requires too much work and preparation to be viable. so, clearly, highsec mission runners enjoy good profit with nonexistent risk. there is few solutions to this:1. agents in highsec could offer less lp.2. introduction of sleeper ai to lvl4 missions would solve the problem too. in this case, rewards for lowsec/nullsec mission runners should be boosted.3. lvl4 agents could be moved to lowsec(or at least all positive quality agents, but it would not change much)."
5/13/2010,"those of you who follow me on twitter or my blog will have already seen this the beta version of my csm database site is up and running.it allows you to see the voting results of each meeting or a combined list of all proposals plus you can click on a delegate and see all the issues they raised.ill be adding various tweaks and so on as people suggest ideas, plus omberzombie has been in touch about uploading the data from csm2, which is great. thanks also to tamber for the title image have a look and let me know what else you would like to see included on the site."
5/13/2010,"hey all,tea has been working on this csm database thing all week. i should know, i've watched it take shape as we chatted about it on irc, even thrown in my own suggestions on styling.if this doesn't prove to people that tea is dedicated to making csm a successful process, i don't know what will. the guy's absolutely gung-ho about this stuff. +2 votes for teadaze!"
5/13/2010,6 more days left to vote
5/13/2010,hmm clear concise answers from someone who seems to realize that games are a balancing scale not an arms race. why do i always have to vote for the logical one?+1 vote good sir.
5/13/2010,"t'amber now that i voted for you, will you pleeeeaaaaase ask ccp to give me some rookie ship bpos, i want some.also please buy my chribba and entity capsules, chribba says they are fake but me and you know better hehehehehe:)heres a troll btw."
5/13/2010,"i've gotten a number of great suggestions on my website, and i always welcome more suggestions! check them out: www.littlethingsfirst.com/forums"
5/13/2010,"care to explain why the vote matcher says you don't agree that scamming should be permitted? was it a misclick, or do you have a specific rationale for this position? if the latter do you intend to actually do anything about it if elected to the csm?"
5/13/2010,"the entire pdf document has some kind of odd font requirement and is completely unreadable aside from about 3 sentancesfrom what i've seen others mention from the csm meetings, there were a few valuable points brought up, like the part about hiding account names from character transfers, but the majority of it is a huge waste of time, a waste of money flying these kids to iceland, and a waste of bandwidth every csm voting period.vote abstain, let your voice be heard."
5/13/2010,"i agree that past efforts by dr. eyjo to provide us with data have been somewhat lacking, but from my past experience in the csm, the reasearch & stats department have access to a lot more information than they make public. my preferred course is for them to use that data, see what information hey can mine from it, and make that information public and ask for players opinions as to a course of action. that would be the feedback loop they could base their actions on.should they decide that t2 bpo's do indeed need to go, then i agree it must be handled delicately as people have worked very hard in a lot of cases to acquire the bpo's, and wholesale removal would disenfranchise a lot of people.it's a very delicate issue, which has been avoided for a long time now. i personally think it's time to make a decision (one way or the other)."
5/13/2010,"you see, my problem with what you say here, is the old ""40% of all minerals come from mission loot"".we all know that the table in question was very imprecise as the ""loot"" column did include reprocessed t2 stuff, reprocessed t1 ships and items used for mineral compression. if, as you say, ccp had access to better data, releasing the that table in that form was done as a deliberate attempt to find a ""culprit"" for the mineral prices, pointing the finger against mission runners. essentially giving false data to follow a political agenda.i prefer to think that ccp has never really done to work to get a clear table that to think they have purposefully given out false data."
5/13/2010,"that table was released (and looked into originally) at the urging of csm 2 (specifically lavista & me). it was completely lacking in information and was imho, stupid. the entire reason we asked for the data to be released was because we both felt there was a serious issue with how minerals were coming into the game, and felt ccp needed to look at it.the table they released was nowhere near as indepth as it should have been, and the day it was released, we sent off a request asking for more indepth data. we never got a response. i raised the issue again at csm3, and again no response. finally, they recently decided to change the mineral composition of looted materials, so i can only guess that they looked at our request, and checked it out.what they do internally to mine data and what they release to the players are 2 separate things - i am hoping to change that so that players have more access to the data. however, as both diagoras & eyjo have said to the csm, certain datapoints could cause a lot of disruption to the economy should they be made public, so they need to be careful as to how much they actually give out.personally i think if the data given out was historical in nature (like in the qen's), then it can have very little impact on the current state, rather it would give us an insight into what they track and base the changes they make on. it would also allow players to point out what they broke in their attempts to fix, which would allow a form of 'peer review' which doesn't seem to happen now until it is far too late."
5/13/2010,"i agree with you.i simply had this ""tin hat"" moment, seeing the release of dubious data as a system to manipulate public opinion. we have too much of that in rl already.i think that a table like the old one cleared of the spurious data would have been very interesting without disrupting the economy as the data were very generic. i see that table cited in md and other section of the forum taking it as a perfect picture of the current situation and not as a snapshot of the situation almost 2 years ago, before some big change in mineral production (wh mining; unholy rage and the increased veldspar spawn; industrial upgrades in 0.0). more often than not it is used to support mission runners hate post and not to try to evaluate the real impact on market and mining of the mission loot."
5/13/2010,"oz, what are your thoughts on using single transferable vote for csm elections?"
5/13/2010,"i think that for the next round 'voting for csm-6 candidates' that players should cast 3 votes (1 vote max. per candidate).1st: 3 points2nd: 2 points3rd: 1 pointreason for this in my opinion is that then you vote better based on what team you would like to see working together rather than to vote based on, for example. charisma, alliance, and/or some good topics someone may have.perhaps you all remember the tv show "" big brother "" where people will have to live together for a year, csm is in a way the same.as i already said a year ago: ""elect 9 muppets and you will get the muppetshow, not a working counsil""aside of how well people are able to present their platforms, and having good ideas you still will need to have fellow csm members being elected that have other abilities/qualifications, like for example, being able to lead a team (is the chairman actually the best person able to lead??) and someone else might have the ability to represent csm better towards the public. imagine a frigid scary nerd to ""push"" ccp to make things better, lol! (but he had a great platform!)so, in short, people should be able to vote for a team, not just a candidate./extreme"
5/13/2010,before mazz will do :pyou can still cast your votes herewould be good if csm-5 would work on this subject with ccp
5/13/2010,"that'll push things much more so towards slate/bloc voting. look at the elvenlord/vuk lau slate in this election, or the goon slates in past. they have to split the votes of people, which provides a natural brake on how big slates can get, thereby broadening representation. if you implement this system, you'll see more 2-3 candidate blocs and fewer individuals winning. that's not what i want."
5/13/2010,"i agree with your point herschel.so suggesting that, while you casting 3 votes, that it's limited to only one candidate of the same alliance and with a possability to be able to abstain to vote for numbers #2 and #3."
5/13/2010,"so you can't vote for vuk and elven, but if omber zombie and i ran on a slate, you could vote for both of us? all you'd get is ""elven lord"" in a npc corp as the candidate, with the main doing all the posting and promotion. alliance tickers are among the easiest things to fake in the game."
5/13/2010,i guess that can be fixed by the 'penalty' that this 'alliance-rule' will also include candidates that left the (same) aliance in a period shorter than 2 months.
5/13/2010,doesn't deal with obvious alts.
5/13/2010,csm candidacy is applied by rl name and passport and thus it doesnt matter what alt you have.all someones alts are connected (only ccp will know) to one rl owner.ccp can see if the candidated alt involved the 2 month rule of one of his other alts.this includes character transfers as well.
5/13/2010,"i do agree the voting system needs to be changed, but my concern with a boorda count (even a limited boorda count, which is what the op proposes) is that it would more easily allow bloc voting by alliances. i think a better option would be the single transferable vote, which would deal with the problem of different candidates ""splitting"" constituencies and works well for multi-seat elections like the csm."

5/13/2010,"let the community vote for features, not people.you will get a much more accurate representation of what the community wants to push ahead, and we would do away with all of the sleezy political vote harvesting, mass eve-mail spamming, take-your-lvl4s-away fear mongering.every csm candidate is running with the promise of changing every gameplay function.ccp made this game what it is today, and it is wonderful that they're willing to listen to the players, but they have let this get out of hand. csm candidates will suggest anything if it means getting a free trip to iceland and an e-peen extension.vote abstain - let your voice be heard."
5/13/2010,"features can't fly to iceland to make themselves heard. and, more importantly, features can't be supported by 10k people at a time. a set of candidates can be."
5/13/2010,"firstly, some of the most popular and uncontroversial features have already been agreed by ccp to be good ideas. submitting a feature list with the same old things on it isn't going to make it happen, but face to face meetings between ccp and a dedicated team at least has a chance of moving things forward.secondly, if you think every csm candidate is running with the promise of changing every gameplay function, then i think you have been rather selective with your reading (although with over 50 candidates standing i couldn't blame you for skim-reading the manifestos)."
5/13/2010,"yes they canlook at the ideas and suggestion forum, those features are transmitted to iceland a hell of a lot faster then a bunch of pizzafaced teenagers =pand why cant a feature be supported by 10k people?if we had a poll containing features, we would have a perfect representation of what the community wants done.the csm candidates on the other hand, claim to support crazy ass **** in order to get votes, and then party in iceland for a week on our dollar."

5/13/2010,anti csm is like statler and waldorfbooooooo!
5/13/2010,theres no need for csm at all. why do i need you to tell ccp what i want? why cant i just press vote on a feature instead?
5/13/2010,you are extremely misinformed. want to see a vote for features? start proposing changes in assembly hall and rustle up support for them. i think you'll discover something important from such an exercise: people are a critical ingredient in effective advocacy.
5/13/2010,"i admit i shouldn't have taken that jab, it wasn't meant literally.however the point still remains, ccp should have a good hard look through all of the proposed ideas in ideas+suggestions forum, then place the ones they would consider into a vote, and let the players have their say.otherwise we end up with ankh again."
5/13/2010,"while i don't think csm is necessarily a good thing, most things in features and ideas and the assembly hall is such horrible trash."
5/13/2010,"which is why ccp should cherry-pick the plausible ideas, maybe 20 of them, and then let everyone vote on theminstead, we have csm people who are running on the assumption that they will be able to do wild things that ccp wouldn't even consider anyways."
5/13/2010,"apology accepted i would guess that ccp doesn't really have the bandwidth to devote to the unbelievably time-consuming job of keeping up with and assessing all the ideas and issues being raised in these forums. having nine elected players who can divide that work up--arguably with greater collective insight than any single internal resource ccp might assign to the task--makes it far more likely that the good stuff rises to the top. besides that, players can access csm members directly to discuss their ideas, be guided in making more informed proposals based on the csm's experience with ccp, and pointed to duplicate issues already addressed or supported. nothing like that direct line of communication exists with ccp. there is a lot of value in those things for parties on both sides of the fence."
5/13/2010,"i think most candidates--even me with my admittedly optimistic (that the answer isn't ""not just no, but hell no. stfu."") low sec agenda--are pretty clear what the csm's role is and what the csm might expect to reasonably accomplish. however, now that ccp is giving csm some stakeholder presence, i'm hopeful there will be opportunities to discuss longer term, bigger ideas (yes, like low sec) that--if good enough, may catch hold of some dev's imagination and be discovered to be worthwhile from a bottom line perspective. whether i'm just being my usual stubbornly optimistic self remains to be seen."

5/14/2010,"so what kind of nerf are you going to propose for the rokh, eagle, ferox, vulture, taranis, moa, and brutix?"
5/14/2010,nerf their pg so they can't fit high-tier rails without multiple fitting mods? oh wai...
5/14/2010,"irrelevant. final values are what matters. and the final values put the eagle competitive with the rest of the lr hacs(despite foolishness of people unwilling to fit in that manner), the ferox and brutix with the rest of the lr bc's and the vulture in a class of its own, and the moa competitive with lr cruisers."
5/14/2010,"increase the base range of rails (provides gallente rail ships with the ""railgun"" niche) and decrease the range bonuses on the caldari ships. maybe switch a bonus on the caldari ships to something else instead of range... targeting range? it would have to be specific to each ship in a way that creates/maintains balance.the vulture fits the role it is meant to fill. giant tank, warfare links, and enough range on its guns to ninja in on killmails (without any real damage output). no changes to hybrids will impact the value of the vulture (locking range limits how far it fires, not the actual guns).the eagle currently is in the same boat... locking range being the limiting factor. messing with the base range of railguns will not impact this. switching a range bonus on the eagle to a locking range bonus would allow it to fit its niche of longer range than the other sniper hacs without sacrificing both damage output and tank (i.e. you could use a mid slot for a tank instead of sensor booster). as nice as it would be to have more damage on that ship, it isn't the niche it is meant to fill.increasing the base range of railguns will not impact the ferox or rokh. they are killmail *****s - heavy tank, fast rof. fixing them so they truly are participating in a fight would require railguns to fire slower, but have more damage per shot (so the dps remains roughly the same).the moa is a horrible ship. it needs fairly massive work that has little to do with railguns specifically.don't know much about the taranis, as i don't like to fly the interceptors that don't have the point range bonus. even with a 10% bonus per level, small rails still won't do a lot of damage? maybe i'm wrong."
5/14/2010,"none, because there's damn near no reason to fly them now... and they might actually have a purpose then. :gasp!: seriously man - the only ship that you might even have a point about would be the taranis, and even that i'm not sure about.-liang"
5/14/2010,just because you don't do fleet work doesn't mean that they don't do their job well compared to the alternatives.this is a terrible idea. and there is nothing wrong with the ships you listed except that you aren't smart enough to use them properly.(or tech 1 cruiseritis)
5/14/2010,"wait, where did i say there was something wrong with any of the ships i mentioned? i said gallente do not have range with rails. so rails should have more base range. many caldari rail ships should have their range bonuses nerfed when the base range is increased. i suggested rather bland bonuses to switch with the range bonuses on caldari ships.edit: wtf is up with you saying people aren't smart enough to ""properly"" fit ships that you never fly, let alone fit? when we are in need of pulse/beam fits, we'll let you know."
5/14/2010,"the vast majority of people in this thread do not think that the sleipnir is the issue at all. i'd argue that it is the most well designed of all the field commands ships atm and is what ccp should strive for when balancing the others.the two ships that have attracted the most attention in both this discussion and others similar to this one are the nighthawk and the astarte. these are the ships that i believe have fundamental issues with both fitting and slots especially when compared to the much cheaper and arguably more effective tier 2 bcs.nighthawk needs more grid, this issue has been identifies and agreed upon by a large portion of the community for quite a long time running. the astarte in my opinion needs an 8th high slot and the additional grid/cap needed to run a gang module on a competitive combat setup. i believe that the armor repair bonus that is commonly associated with gallente bcs needs a revisit as well. i do not believe the solution should be to change the bonus but rather increase the % on the bc and related t2 type ships. the major issues i see with increasing this tanking bonus is that it could potentially have a negative impact on pve balance. although to be completely honest it's not like the brutix, myrmidon, or astarte are kings of pve atm."
5/14/2010,"i didn't read all four pages, i was replying to the op, who asked for an extra slot and a bunch of cpu for a ship that's already pretty awesome. same with the absolution. i'm fine with giving the nighthawk some pg, and i agree that active tank bonuses need to be buffed, probably to 10%/level, on all ships that have them. giving the astarte room for a gang link is probably too much, but at least within the bounds of reason. but that isn't what the op asked for. he asked for an eighth neutron blaster on the astarte, and an extra mid/low slot on both the absolution and the sleipnir. all of those suggestions are frankly ludicrous."

5/14/2010,why not?
5/14/2010,"as much as the idea of having your own biological ship that you can morph according to your needs amuses me,i question what theym add to gameplay. if they are implemented, their roles will me simular to those of current t3 cruisers. on the other hand, they extremely remind me of rogue drones, those are mecanisms gone wild. either way, although the idea absolutely is amusing, it will be troublesome to implement, and i would probsably whant the shader model updated and grafics given another facelift, with the current grafics engine alive ships would look like ugly parodies. after trinity two- sure. so conclusion: idea: 9/10 feasability: 3/10if ccp ever thinks about making a new class/line/faction of ships (which they will eventually, at some point) this should be very-very high on priorities list. i disagree. untill recently i thought planetary interaction isn 't eve. i cannot see why ytou woul not have this as eve. please explain how this conflicts with your vision of the game."

5/14/2010,"it's an option, not forced. i have no problem with giving bridge owners the option of letting their blues fly through it freely."
5/14/2010,"i apologize but i'm not exactly understanding the complaints here. from what i've gathered people assume that:#1. you will be forced to purchase an authenticator if they are offered.#2. you will rely entirely on the authenticator and no longer rely on your password.#3. only noobs get hacked.i'll address #1 first. what part of 'optional additional level of security' makes this seem required? if you don't want it, don't get it.now onto the second one, #2. why would you rely only on an authenticator? what would be the point? the whole idea behind these devices is so that a hacker has to break through your password and the authenticator. and i doubt if an authenticator is cracked that it will mean the end of eve, considering that if you break the authenticator you still need the password to begin with.and finally #3. noobs are not the only ones who get hacked. careful players get hacked as well. i don't care how good you think you are, it doesn't overly matter. there is always someone better out there who knows how to get around something you're unaware of, and before you know it you've been hacked. a virus doesn't only hang around in the 'bad part of town'. if that was the case, then they would never get to the rich, juicy targets.addendum: uh, wouldn't it require their password to be hacked for their characters to be stripped bare? how else would someone have access to their password if not for hacking? the only way that situation would be possible is if someone literally told another person their password, and that person logged in and stole their information."
5/14/2010,"doh!!! rena, you have just proved you know very little about how hacks work.in most mmo's when the subject of accounts getting hacked rears its ugly head, dev's usually respond saying that the majority of accounts do not have their passwords hacked.that is why it is very difficult for them to replace any lost items because it is very difficult to prove you were actually hacked.why, because 9 times out of 10 key loggers have been installed on the users pc, which means the hacker does not need to hack anything.it is the easiest and most efficient why to gain access to somebodies account. so simple that a 12 year old could do it.as to your first point, if you don't want it, don't use it, everyone would still have to pay for it.you think that setting up a system like that is free? of course it isn't. there is a cost to be incurred. most authentication devices cost anywhere from <U+FFFD>20 to <U+FFFD>80 pounds each depending on the manufacturer and quality of the device.no user will pay that which means the developer will make a loss on each device. then you have the cost of setting up the architecture. are you going to pay for this... there are only 2 mmo's who use these tokens, blizzard and square enix, 2 massive companies who can afford to absorb the costs of implementing such a system and even then they charge $10 dollers per device, when they are actually in stock that is."
5/14/2010,"so essentially it's just a means to avoid responsibility when someone gets hacked by a technicality. it's still malicious software used to steal account information, which is just another way of hacking.actually that isn't true. at least how much it costs from activision blizzard. an authentication device only costs $5.99 or $4.99. and if you download an app for your smartphone the cost is only $0.99.regardless, what you're forgetting is that there is a tradeoff. while an authenticator may not outright prevent hacking from occurring, if it prevents half of the current hacks that occur then ccp will be able to devote less manpower and time to handling hacked accounts. you have to consider how much it costs right now to actually reimburse someone for what they lost.and still you're assuming that only foolish people can get hacked. again i firmly disagree with this, and would dare to say it shows how little you understand about how the internet works. despite having the best anti-virus software to date, and all the security you can offer to protect yourself, you're still nowhere near being completely safe. even if you only visit eveonline.com, there's still a chance that something malicious can be installed. even surfing google it can occur. there is no 100% guarantee to avoid ever being infected. otherwise we wouldn't need anti-virus software."
5/14/2010,"no its not a means of avoiding responsibility by the developers part when somebody gets hacked.let me put it this way, if all developers said, if you get hacked we will restore your account, including all items, in game money etc... how would they know if you were truly hacked? after all your password was not changed, they would just have to take your word that somebody acquired your password and they sold off your times and then transferred your in game money to another account.can image how many claims would suddenly appear from people claiming they have been hacked?to stop this the developer would then have to dedicate resource to investigate every claim and even then it would be nearly impossible to prove it either way.in regards to costs.. are you deliberately mis-understanding me.blizzard is charging $6 for the tokens. this sounds like they are providing these at cost (my bad the price had changed). this is for the actual token itself. there are other costs to blizzard, too. they need to maintain software on the backend that works with the keys. they also need to deal with support costs, as users break the keys and lose them or are just too stupid to figure out how they work.i have personally dealt with rsa securid as part of my job as many defence companies use then.the standard price guide isfor a 3 year period for 10,000 users the solution price is $ 1,110,900 with a per-user price per year cost of $ 111.09now of course these prices are negotiable. one defence company who employees over 120,000 staff world wide who use rsa securid pay a per-user price per year of $89.13 over a 3 year period.however that is still a major hit for a small company. blizzard is a multi million dollar company and can easily absorb these costs.ccp is no way anywhere near the size of blizzard. ccp do not make anywhere the revenue that blizzard do. do you think that ccp can incur these costs without passing them to their customer?you have to look at the bigger picture.of course a careful user can still download something that has a virus/trojan attached, however your point about there is no 100% guarantee to avoid ever being infected otherwise we wouldn't need anti-virus software is simply ridiculous. why do you think i keep stressing the point in having up to date anti virus/malware and spyware software installed on your machine?its about having the combination of these software, being careful about where you visit on the web and what you download and making sure you use a strong password which is changed regularly will stop you from being hacked.i am not prepared to pay extra or suffer reduce content/updates/bug fixes because ccp has to divert resource away from the actual game because some people can't help downloading everything application they can find to try or buy isk from gold sellers to try and cheat the system."
5/14/2010,"it's become clear to me now that we're both of differing opinions and neither side is going to concede to the other, so it would be easiest to just stop the argument here.all i'll say is that i still disagree with you and would appreciate a second layer of protection for my account, and feel many other people would as well. there's just no reason for this to become a war of opinions when all it is is a proposal."
5/14/2010,good ideai support this.we need something simple without extra costs.

5/14/2010,seems reasonable.
5/14/2010,"for those who are for this idea, what you're really wishing for is a standalone eve game to play off your computer's hard drive, where anything and everything around you is not human and can be controlled by difficulty levels and whatnot. if that's what you want, there are plenty of other environments out there which offer you that control.when one purchases an eve account, that purchase should be made with the realization that you're buying into the eve environment and all it can entail, right? you did your homework before committing, right? it seems that many people come in with the expectation that they'll exist in their own bubble and any external human-human interaction will be made on their own terms. when that expectation is shattered, we get rl emo threads like this one.so, to sum that up: you bought into eve, thus you should have been aware of what can happen once you do so. if you weren't, then that's no one else's fault but your own. you are not a ship passing in the night, and no one else is, either. eve is what it is, and if that's orthogonal to what you desire, then perhaps you're playing for the wrong reasons."

5/14/2010,"yes, i know its been suggested before but i've added a little twist.-loans will be available to any player twice per month.-each loan will be for a set period of time at a set rate of interest. at the end of the time, 2 things could happen:1) the money is taken off your wallet, if you don't have enough, you go negative.2) assets which you control are seized to repay the debt (probably to complicated)-trial accounts will not be eligible for loans.-interest would be tacked onto the end of the loan. if it says 5% interest on a 2 week, 10 million isk loan, you pay back 10.5 million at the end of the 2 weeks. if it says 5% interest on a 10 million isk loan for 1 week, you pay back 10.5 million at the end of the week. interest rates are not subject to any time period. longer loans recieve higher interest rates. bigger loans recieve lower interest rates.-these are the maximums at which loans would be granted. obviously these would be tweaked and balanced if you implemented the idea:toons <2 weeks old - 2 million. 1 week. 10% interest (ideal for a first frig + mods)toons 2-4 weeks old - 5 million. 2 weeks. 7.5% interest (starting to get into destroyer hulls with some t2 modules)toons 4-8 weeks old - 10 million. 2 weeks. 5% interest (going into cruiser hulls with t2 tanks)toons 2-4 months old - 20 million. 4 weeks. 2-4% interest (depending on time scale of loan).toons 4-8 months - 50 million. 4 weeks. 1-4% interest.toons >8 months - 100 million. 4 weeks. 1-4% interest.just an idea, feel free to tear it to shreds - but i felt this would not only help new players looking for that shiny destroyer or cruiser (as well as skills that can be expensive to them such as advanced learning) as well as those more experience who have fallen on hard times."
5/14/2010,"in a word, no.also ""toon"".. really?"
5/14/2010,"you'd destroy the player loans market, and lead to all kinds of fun scamming of npc's. no thanks."

5/14/2010,"no. counter-proposal: we know eve has a set of 'pre-defined' skins for its ships, based on npc corporate/faction affiliation. recent previews of the (awesome) new scorpion model have shown us these.my suggestion (not really a proposal since i'm not really that bothered by most of the colour-schemes if my ships) would be - allow players to select from the available corporation skins of the racial ship type. i.e a blackbird could be issued to a player in civilian, ishukone fleet, lai-dai protection service or kaalakiota corporate colours; a thorax could be produced in creodron, duvolle labs or roden shipyards paint jobs and so on. however i remain fairly 'meh' on the whole business of changing the look of your internet spaceship. how long until every caldari pilot chooses to fly all their ships in kaalakiota black'n'red? still, it'd be nice to get rid of those horrible, pointless camo paint schemes, wouldn't it?"
5/14/2010,"i always like a little customization. however, paint jobs is going a little far. like a space (single player eve rip off) i've spotted on steam the other day, total paint jobs makes a ship look ridiculous.i would like the idea of tagging a ship with a logo similar to the options set out for customizing corp and alliance logos.the only downside is that i'm not really concerned with checking out the tats of another ship. in reality the game play doesn't really allow for a close inspection of hull art.overall, i'd say time to improve the game could be spent elsewhere.unsupported."
5/14/2010,"everyone who ever participated in a large battle has seen it. everyone who i have asked hates it. yes, ladies and gentelment, it is the sensor booster and eccm effect. the main problem is that the effect is very long range, it covers large volume, and so when you have a fleet it stacks up. as a result fleet slook realy ungly, it breaks immersion, increases lag and spoils screenshots because instead of seeing lasers and ships exploding you see a blured blob of light. my proposal: add an option to disable remote self effects. whyle seing enemy turrets firing and enemy shield oosters might be important, sensor boosters are clearly not vital, esfeshially when you have about 150 ships on the field you do not really care if someone has a sensor booster. so, i would like an option to turn off remote self effects: that is a sensor booster, armor repping and eccm effect on anyone except me. on the other hand, firing, explosion and energy neutrolisers effects would still show up. what also needs to be done, is redesigning the sensor booster and eccm effect to consume smaller volume of space and to be more local, much like armor repping effect was redun. maybe it should look the way remote sensor boosters do, or blue grow arouund ship, but it has to be much more compact so it does not stack up. images illustrating screenshot spoiuled by a sensor boosting effect- this si a relatively small gang without too many sensor boosters, so effect is not that bad here, in many cases it is much worse:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.with the effectplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.without the effect the option to disable sensor boosters and other effects like eccm should not requre too much development time, and is going to make life easier for everyone who participates in large fleet battles."
5/14/2010,i never did understand why a relatively insignificant module had to have such a massive visual effect. so you have a sensor booster running..why does that need such a huge light show? tone it down.
5/14/2010,you can disable effects already. esc -> display & graphics -> effects -> effects.voila the sensor booster effects are gone.
5/14/2010,"i don't have problems with all the effects, i still whant to see where my enemy is firing, that is very important in combat. i do not however wish to see if my enemy is sensor boosting or nit, in it's current implementation the effect is extremely disturbing as you can see from the screenshots above. i would like to be able to disable all remote self effect that means all effects that only attack the ship that carrier them, that is armor hardeners, reppers, shield boosters, sensor boosters, tracking computers, they are not important and in fleet combat cause visual polution. i whant to have a seperate button to disable them. as for sensor boosters, the effect needs to be re-designed as in it's current implementation it1 makes no sence2 breaks immersion3 is disturbing4 progressively becomes stronger in large fleets up to the point where you can barely see ships and lasers, and only see one blob of light5 looks uglyi would really like to be able to disable every effect seperately, but disabling remote self-effects would do."
5/14/2010,i support this *only* if this is true. i really like the effects and don't see anything immersion breaking or annoying in your screen shots.-liang
5/14/2010,"that is because this is a small gang and not everyone was sensor boosting, unfortunately i don't have a better screenshot at the moment, i recently reinstalled my system. when you have 50+ battleships all sensor boosting and with eccm''s, it gets horrible."

5/14/2010,"spported, when your better off flying the tec 1 version of a ship it needs some serious looking at. the only ship tha might be worth the trouble would be the kitsune, but even that is horribly outclassed by ships that cost a fraction of the price."

5/14/2010,i dont see this proposal as being a bad idea actually obviosuly keep the moon mining ores to the basic ores you can already mine in high sec.this would give newer players the chance to try out moon mining in a relatively safe environment to learn whats needed to setup moon mining ops in places like lo-sec and o.o.while we are at it though id like to be able to moon mine inside of wh's too.

5/14/2010,no. people should be capable to aligning by themselves when in a fleet and this idea is about as good as if calling targets in-game would automaticly make you lock. if your gang can't align properly then the last thing it needs is having it done by someone else.

5/14/2010,ok i have noticed that the deimos is paper thin even with a plate onso i would suggest to swap some bonuses and add one for resist so it stops dying so fastalso as it is close range and the capacitor penalty decrease for mwd doesn't do that much i would swap it for a activation cost decrease and changing the falloff bonus into a tracking one so it can actually apply the damage it can dogallente cruiser skill bonus: 10% bonus to microwarpdrive capacitor use per 10% medium hybrid turret tracking speed per levelheavy assault ship skill bonus: 10% bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level 5% bonus to armor resists per levelfurther on i would decease the strangely high signature radius of 160mm (which is the highest on all hacs if not on all cruiser hulls) down to its t1 hulls 140mmi would also up the scan resolution to maybe 300mm so it also gets some use in gate camps in exchange the targeting range should drop to 50km because it is supposed to use blasters close range anywaythe 6th high slot doesn't do much adding another gun mount would make it overpowered and it wouldn't even work because the model only has 5 gun mounts i wouldn't want to scrap it though cause it leaves space for some creativity it is true that the deimos is kind of a brick especially when plated and using mwd so i think it wouldn't be a bad idea to take the mass down to 10kt and the inertia to 0.550 to make it a bit more agile and accelerate faster with the mwd
5/14/2010,"seriously? l4s will never be removed from high sec. not only are they a major part of the economic engine in game, but there's too many people who - for whatever reason - enjoy them and would likely leave eve entirely if they were all removed. have any of the candidates advocated this?"
5/14/2010,"i don't think many would even seriously consider it, for the exact reasons you mentioned."
5/14/2010,"ah.... then i guess, i was dreaming this here:"
5/14/2010,"i do have bigger plans for fw, but the current priority is fixing the bugs and imbalances. after that, i'd like to see fw properly finished instead of being the half-baked expansion it is now.ironically, the current npc presence in the fw plexes hinders pvp, if you play for amarr or gallente, you even have to come with specific pve ships to deal with them properly. actual pvp is not encouraged in fw as all objectives and profitable activities are pve based (plexing and mission-running). adding lp for kills was a first step in the right direction, but unfortunately people often do not get lp even though they participated in the kill.ccp already agreed that the fw plex mechanic is flawed, and that people often do not find eachother for combat. increasing the timer length obviously won't work either and only makes it more boring. i personally see a role for dynamic objectives which are broadcast to the whole militia.such as: ""a convoy will go from x to y, clear the way and make sure that as many ships survive"", with the opposing side receiving a ""the enemy is transporting military equipment, it was last seen in x, search and destroy!"".or: ""we're setting up a listening post in system x, defend us for 30 minutes so we can establish the defenses!"" and the other side receiving a ""the enemy is building a base in system x, you have a 30 minute window to destroy it before the defenses are activated!""the participants will then receive victory points, a standing boost, and loyalty points based on their successrate.with several of these going on at once, with mission objectives requiring specific kinds of ships, players will always find something to do."
5/14/2010,and yet again you demonstrate your complete lack of understanding of eve.what triggers these events? timers or number of players currently active in fw? how do you detect that? what if a convoy/defence event starts and there are no enemies to attack it? how do you prevent players from blobbing this and grinding it?you don't understand eve. these things you propose are too script driven and do not belong at all in te eve experience.
5/14/2010,"i first didn't care about the csm election, then read some stuff, voted for a candidate, done.now, after reading the eve-tribune article, i made some research of my own (forum, your homepage, your curriculum vitae, ""take care"") and came to the conclusion that in my impression, you are not trustworthy and i would personally find it highly alienating if ccp would allow you into the csm. why? because of 1) your self-presentation and the way you are treating your critics, which i think are doing their best to stay as constructive as possible in their effort in deconstructing what i perceive as your bubble; why do i think that? because the less rational the critique towards you is conducted, the easier it is for you to dismiss it, which would not be in their favor.2) because of the ""resume issue""; you stated your time on the csm as ""employment"" by ccp.i will start with my critique towards you at point 2) and quote from a post of mine on shc to detail my point of view.you can read the original discussion and my post here:"
5/14/2010,"i will further state in my email to ccp that i would not condone the fact that you would generate quite high expenses (flights and lodgings are not cheap at all) for ccp, which could be put towards things like- some more work-hours of actual ccp staff, which i am sure have more expertise than you, who does not and never did work for ccp and displays a disdain against one of the core-principles of eve, with which ccp also advertises, namely a ruthless, harsh, unforgiving space crazyness. in lobbying against, you are essentially lobbying against the main reason i subscribed to this game; at the same time, you are also essentially declaring yourself that you do not want to occupy yourself with this core principle of the game. since i think that when judging a matter, personal experience comes first, because while not having to fully understand every issue (god forbid), you have to have at least some understanding. in dismissing this core principle as ""immoral"", you are not only passing moral judgement, but you are also not giving the impression that you would fight for every issue everyone brought to you equally - but you advertise with that exact statement.example? from your first post: it is interesting to see that you are following a very clear, streamlined, nlp-esque approach in communication, but when it comes to an issue you personally want to see changed, you suddenly slip into the classic method of ridiculing the opposing fraction's sentimentsno, i do not believe you that you can be impartial and treat people who don't agree with your views with enough respect.i will also state in my email that i would like to know what one csm delegate costs the company/year, and that i would absolutely not condone the fact that you, in my perceived dishonesty, would consume even a cent of what i pay for this game.to conclude, i provided you with a free bump, more attention and yet another opinion you might brush of as ""troll"". however, with your actions you also provided one the other candidates with now both of my votes."
5/14/2010,i decided to read the cv and the attached covering letter and i cant see why people believe she was being misleading by listing her volunteer work for ccp in her employment history.im from britain and it is commonplace for volunteer work to be listed in your employment history. the uk governments employment site even suggests that you do so.
5/14/2010,"if you read my post again, you will find out that i state that she would be stupid not to put it in her cv and that i don't argue against putting it in there per se or her trying to look as good as possible on her resume, on the contrary - it's perfectly fine of course, and we all do it.you will also see that i don't claim that she tried to make the impression of having worked as a dev.i, however, have also learned/been taught to always separate - working for a wage and - volunteer work, or at least clearly designate it as such. this, she did not. also not in the accompanying letter. a clean, honest cv would say ""worked as a player-elected volunteer"" or similar. six words, done, and i would have never typed this.i am arguing semantics here ofc. still. definition of employment = primarily ""working for a wage"", employer = the dude/dudette/company that pays you a wage. the main characteristic of her ""employment"" at ccp/csm was that she, herself, decided to run and got, next to several other people, elected by a fraction of the players, not by ccp because of her skills or talents. this isn't made clear.instead, she chose to underline that she was part of the ""official"" council and ""worked closely with developers"" after ""being flown to iceland"", but leaves it open if she was appointed by ccp themselves or...not.also, she states ""player-developer communication, game design, [...]""""from the unique perspective of a game designer, i found that i could have a positive impact, which is reflected by the changes implemented in the game"" (p.4 of her cv, ""professional attitude"").i am heavily repeating my 2cents, so i'm stopping here; i think my point is clear and this is more nerdposting at once than i've done in a year or two."
5/14/2010,i would agree with you. it would be clearer to state volunteer. yes i agree. each country has their definition of what employment is in legal terms. there is no point discussing that here since eva has not claimed to be an employee of ccp.yes i agree the manner in which she was elected wasnt made clear. she stuck to the positive with the fact that she was elected.
5/14/2010,"really, this whole thing about the cv is a storm in a teacup.the real issue is her repeatedly stated contempt for the players, contempt for the game and contempt for ccp. and the glaring conflict of interest of working for another game company which has a space-based mmo. that conflict alone should be enough to disqualify her, tbh."
5/14/2010,"excellent! my kind of candidate. i don't want alliance puppets sucking up to ccp. i want them to tell them when they **** up. furthermore, i ***** about the game all the time and so does nearly every other capsuleer i know. contempt for the players, hell i have a ****load of players i hold in contempt. a lot of them troll these very forums. so, thank you for further convincing me my votes are well spent with ankhbear \o/"
5/14/2010,"i wasn't going bother voting on the csm, but ank just got my four votes. i don't agree with her position on some issues, but i do agree on her main stated focus of pressuring ccp on the finishing and polishing aspect of expansions, which are indeed being rushed out of the door in an increasing state of half-bakedness and brokeness, and left pretty much as such while ccp jumps into the next expansion. i believe this is one of the biggest problems eve has at the moment.but aside from all that, she's ended up getting my votes because of the spine, character and determination she's demonstrated in the face of this preposterous character assassination campaign towards her. emoraging volumes of tears - now even on eve tribute - at nitpicks over the precise words she use or didn't use on her personal cv? you are all coming across as a bunch of pathetic little whiny girls. f*ck off."
5/14/2010,"mmmm hmmm. for those who are curious, what the tribune actually pointed out was a history of bad judgment on ank's part, showing that she simply does not understand the game, respect how ccp created it, and that she has a self-righteous sense of superiority that leads her to talk nonsense about how horrible people are who play the game as ccp intended. all of this was done, by the way, either with quotes that she wrote, in her own words, using her own character (the vast majority), or in a few cases with chat logs which have been verified by the people who were in them/saw them going on, but denied by ank. we also pointed out that despite her claims on her cv, she was never employed by ccp (in fact ccp explicitly says that csm delegates are not employed by ccp) and that she did not actually participate in ""game design"", unless everybody on the forums who suggests and idea to ccp is a ""game designer"". just goes to possible motives for wanting to be on the csm.surely though, you're not an alt or someone who already supported ank, and your wild misrepresentation of the content of the tribune's article is just a coincidence."
5/14/2010,"nice theory you got there. though it lacks bite: would you like a copy of my cv so you can add whatever nitpicks you manage to find? i can also furnish you with private game logs, and posting history on unrelated forums. i'm confident you'll find there plenty of ammunition and things to get offended over and whine about to your heart's content."
5/14/2010,"which you 'disprove' by... doing exactly what i accused you of: deliberately misrepresenting the facts of ank's own statements, in her own words. while, just coincidentally, parroting ank's own denials of why her own statements matter. i particularly like that bit, it's ank's ""sure i said crazy stuff that shows i don't know how eve works and i'm hostile to those who play the game as ccp intended... but you can find bad stuff about anybody if you look hard enough!"" i'm sure the fact that you're using ank's own argument about why ank doesn't have to justify let alone address her own comments is just a coincidence. i mean, after all, you told us that you had no affiliation or support for her before right now. what luck!just a coincidence, i'm sure. and just as i'm sure of that, i'm sure that you accidentally missed everything of substance in order to dishonestly, oops, i mean accidentally, state that what we're talking about are mere ""nitpicks"" and stuff on 'unrelated forums'. unrelated forums like, ya know, the forum we're posting on now, which is where most of her quotes came from. here, i'll remind you, feel free to respond to the facts any time now:but hey, ""elect me to the csm, i hate pvpers and more padding on my resume would be good, maybe next time i'll say that i didn't just work for ccp doing 'game design', but since i fielded questions from people i'll say i was employed as 'human resources management'. oh oh oh! since providing suggestions to ccp is 'game design' and people put those suggestions to me before i forward them on, maybe i was employed by ccp for 'lead game design'. yeah..."" may be a valid campaign pitch and we're just nitpicking it."
5/14/2010,"i have to say i see considerable similarities between ankh's supporters and those of sarah palin. no, i'm being perfectly serious. take a look at this article on palinism by julian sanchez, which is not too long and is worth reading in full, and then compare what sanchez sees in the tea parties to what's going on here and in the other threads related to the tribune's editorial. both's supporters seem to be fueled by what sanchez identifies as ressentiment:thus the more people demonstrate how thoroughly terrible a candidate ankh is, the more it seems that her supporters, bristling at the contempt they imagine that pvp ""elites"" hold them in, support her, even though there are numerous other candidates far better qualified to represent their views.just saying."
5/14/2010,dariah stardweller is ankhbear's btw.
5/14/2010,she did not claim to be employed by ccp.
5/14/2010,jezus you don't even have the fantasy to come up with different word choises.
5/14/2010,"she listed csm under ""employment"".not, say, ""hobbies"", or ""volunteer work"", or ""other interests"", or anything other than ""employment"". i know that listing something under ""employment"" might just, unreasonably, be seen as ""employment"", but we'll just have to live with that mistaken impression, eh, eh?of course, ccp had her sign an agreement specifically saying that the csm was not employment, but who are we going to believe, csm when they say they're not employing her, or her, when she says she was employed by ccp? she also listed things as parts of her ""employment"" with ccp that she simply never did for ccp, like ""game design"". ccp actually has a position called ""game designer"" (it's their dev position). does ""making suggestions to ccp"" sound the same as that job description? myself, i just can't figure out any possible motive for someone in the games industry to want to hold a position that they think they can put on a resume and describe as being employed by ccp doing ""game design"". hrm... care to hazard a guess?"
5/14/2010,"the biggest lulz will be if it turns out that piece you guys wrote on the eve tribune - along with all the trolling on these forums - horribly backfires, and contrary to its stated it intentions ends up getting ank enough additional votes to get elected."
5/14/2010,"then the joke, sadly, will not be so much on the tirbune as it will be on those who voted for her."
5/14/2010,"so, no, then. of course, it'll be a damn shame if ank gets elected and keeps an actually qualified person off the csm. it's hardly something to celebrate. she doesn't understand 0.0,s he doesn't understand lowsec, she doesn't understand pvp, she doesn't even really understand pve. there are far better carebear candidates if one wanted to vote for one, anyways. and it's not like ccp is going to advertise the thrill of mining or the awesomeness of mission running. there's a reason that all of their ads are about combat and fleet fights. someone who will, at best, not help that and, at worst, hurt that will damage eve as a game and as a brand. cheering that on because you enjoy the thought of trolling for ank... is kind of lame."
5/14/2010,"oh, wait... you were seriously expecting me to waste my time answering your distorted opinionated crap and conspiracy theories?"
5/14/2010,"in a follow-on discussion to the low sec focus group mentioned a couple of posts ago, my fellow csm5 candidate illectroculus defined had some interesting ideas for expanding the concept of ""production of criminal goods"" as a way of boosting low sec with unique content. he wrote those ideas up in his blog. keep in mind that illectro's ideas are just that: ideas, not well-defined proposals. thinking outside the box was highly encouraged during the the focus group, as is further discussion. personally i thought the ideas were intriguing and once tweaked for overall balance would fit neatly as components of an incrementally-implemented criminal production supply chain.i'm sharing the link here as a way of keeping all the focus group stuff together for easy access by those who are interested. if you have questions for illectro about his ideas, you should probably comment on his blog post or in his campaign thread."

5/14/2010,"wow, the ""cool kid"" really is in desperate need to bump and pump his own thread daily, right?"
5/14/2010,go back to jerking off to ankh like a good little carebear.
5/14/2010,"right, that's a mature response from a mature candidate... that's your style, puny oneliners consisting of only one word like ""noooooooooooooooooooooo"". remeber that thread here? great attitude from your side, great csm effort, no really... oh, and this time, i am pretty sure, you won't get a ""free ride to island from my sub's money"":edit:consider that a free bump, ""kewl kid"". everyone shall be made aware, how you as a csm reacted to legit inquiries by paying customers on this board."
5/14/2010,your main doesn't happen to be natana does it? because he started like this on the eveger board and got modslapped because he was being ******ed.
5/14/2010,"unfortunatly not, i adore her. but that very thread made me aware of your premature attitude and if you insist, i surely can quote some of the rubbish nonsense you said there. you have your nose pretty high in the air, if it comes down to the customers of eve.do you prefer to take the discussion back ""to the free trip to island that you enjoyed off the subs money""? or do you want to discuss your behaviour on other boards, ""kewl kid""?"
5/14/2010,"you're obviously correct that i'm a stuck up elitist that has never helped anyone and has never done anything for this game or the community. i'll go outside now and throw myself under the next bus because you've made me realise how useless i am...see? it's not difficult to treat serious internet business with a lighthearted attitude, something you'll never be able to do."
5/14/2010,"your're not ""lighthearted"", in fact you are desperatly trying to get your votes together by bumping your own threads and spamming mails and channels, and on top of that by trolling other csm's threads and by denigrating those, who don't agree with your small and personal view of eve.thats all fine, but it is not adequate for a csm candidate in my book. so, no: ""no free trip to island"" for you anymore ""from my subs money"". i really appreciate that you revealed your true nature in that very thread on this board. thanks again and concider this comment again as a free bump... you look like you need them."
5/14/2010,"i literally laughed out loud at the massive overdose of irony generated in these few sentences. you are absolutely clueless, so it suits you quite well to vote for ankh."
5/14/2010,"thanks again for proving my point(s): you are not suited to candidate for a csm seat, due to your prematurity and your lack of respect for the paying customer(s) who do not share your point of view. allways if it comes down to you disagreeing with someone or something, you are only good for one of your silly oneliners containing some minor insult, but you are not good for some constructive discussion on the topic.so go ahead and continue to flame yourself out of your nomination... the more the better, as it only reveals to us your true nature."
5/14/2010,"please, quote stuff that shows howmuch i loathe the average eve player that is not one of those two sarcastic lines that you have recycled a dozen times here and on the eveger boards. (that are properly moderated, contrary to the eve-o ones)"
5/14/2010,"this candidate is beyond terrible and will not be getting my 5 votes. the posting, the ideas and mannerisms are all very substandard."
5/14/2010,there is still time to vote my fellow eve capsuleers. if voted in i will pursue subject like better protection for mission runners along with balancing of ship classes. also on my agenda is sovereignty and getting some level 5 agents into high sec.i am working on a new proposal that will make players that probe out mission runners have to have good standings with that agent they are running and have hacking skills along with certain new modules they have to fit in order to use the gates.this is just a few of the many things my experience with this game i can bring to the table.

5/14/2010,"do you have a problem with ppl born outside of teh us, let alone kenya? do i smell racism there?well all csm farm votes more or less in the same manner. you forgot to mention those pvp-orientated csm who really want level 4 mission removed from highsec empire and all pve with that:"
5/14/2010,"actually there are a number of ""carebear"" candidates out there and this is the only one tribune has run a negative article about."
5/14/2010,i totally hope she does this.
5/14/2010,"same, it would be hilarious. i'd be up for donating to get a decent defence (defense?) lawyer."
5/14/2010,"i do apologise, but under dutch law that is not correct. an unpaid employee, regardless of a format of 0 hour or ad hoc, has a contract, this is required by law to protect the employee. a volunteer has an agreement. the difference between these formats may often escape observation, is very often mostly irrelevant to the person in question, but constitutes quite a tangible difference to the employer since it is the employer which has to set aside good old monies for a range of legally required purposes (insurance, for one, pension fund, andsoforth).keep in mind the legal status of employee in the netherlands, in fact in most countries of the eu, something which does not apply to a volunteer status. i don't particularly care for all the drama, and i must admit, i have seen my share of c.v.'s with far stranger collusions, in the range of a few dozen a year, but please note the difference between these formats.technically, factually, or even principally, ankh should not have listed her activities as employment. practically, it is not uncommon to see people make mistakes like these, and quite often it is found that even though the actions reside in the category of volunteer work they do form a base of experience. sometimes even expertise.whether this was the case, constituted relevance or the absence of, that was up to her employer when validating the c.v. prior to engaging in contract. this is irrelevant for the debate here."
5/14/2010,"no matter what this ank characters flaws the tribune going out of its way to discredit her kinda made me cringe maybe i'm hoping a bit much from an in-game publication, but seems like the editor saw some easy prey & decided to get in on some ""cheap action""possibly the lure was too great.i mean seriously how much of a threat is she even with outrageous ideas.isn't there voting involved in csm ? so like seriously, since the ideas are not gonna get traction and ccp definitely won't get swayed with stuff like pvp is bad .... why systematically tear her apartfound some easy prey and suddenly everyone is at their trolling best feeding off themselvesweak sauceto put it in context, there have been many bad candidates before. i even recon some of them still get back in despite that due to political backing /e-fame ?based on the attendance records and actual contribution seems that a few others enjoy a free ride & that seems like quite the travestyi guess that's much ""tougher topic' so no need for tribune to go out of its way to ruffle feathersmaybe if you really want to make some ""public service announcement"" the editor would consider something not so opportunistic & don't stoop to bashing someone who is already down"
5/14/2010,"so, even if her character flaws are obvious and proven by her own words expressing her own views, posted on her own account... it was wrong to point them out and represents some sort of extreme effort on our part. seriously? the victimology nonsense does nobody any good. what we saw was a candidate manifestly unsuited for a position on the csm, so we gathered the facts and wrote the piece. you seem to agree with it. if she was a strong candidate then we wouldn't have had ""easy prey"", now would we? it's fairly obvious, actually. we can have a csm with as many capable, knowledgeable people as possible, able to speak intelligently and constructively about all aspects of the game. or we can have some of those folks and some others whose very presence has to be neutralized and who would do real damage to the game if they were able to implement their views unfettered by opposition. when faced with the option between those who can contribute and those who can only hinder, why would you argue that we should have someone who hinders the process because, hey, they can be outvoted anyways? no. to put it in context while there are candidates who aren't great or who are even bad, none approaches the level of ank. which yet again, is why she's unsuitable for the csm and why even you admit that she's ""easy prey""."
5/14/2010,"did i miss a patch note??why would they move level 4s to lowsec?on another note, while all this is extremely interesting its not to my taste; everyone has something in their past that the public can pull apart and torment them with and/or expressed extremely stupid things and changed their mind about it later.all these comments and all the drahmas have the potential to significantly boost her ratings and chances of getting a full seat. this is a game where people love tears and i hope for your sake that karma is looking the other way when people are selecting someone to vote for otherwise theres going to be lots of them.although this may seem true on first glance i assure you it is not, i for one am the ultimate carebear, i don't even undock if i can help it, its cold and lonely out there . most of the candidates running for csm are intellegent enough to realise the connections and neccesity of having hisec activites available and you'd probably find that most of them have ""carebear"" activities on the side. if csm4 is anything to go by they're not above researching something outside the scope of their agenda and experience so that they're able to make a wellthought vote... well most of them anyway. i believe it started off constructively atleast, but discrediting someone's ideas i have no problem with - especially if they're completely misinformed or ignorant, but person attacks are like you say and a complete waste of text.-t'amber"
5/14/2010,"it's an obvious joke. read up on the original ""born in kenya"" debate herethere are very, very few people in eve rich enough to be pvp only players, unless you think ratting or missioning with an alt is pvp."
5/14/2010,no use arguing with him the guy has as much humour as the pieces of roten shark they feed you in iceland.
5/14/2010,"i've done a lot of internet arguing. a surprisingly large amount was done with the knowledge that i didn't have a hope of changing the mind of the person i was directly arguing against. it's done for the benefit of onlookers, who usually aren't nearly as pigheaded as the people who are actually willing to spend their time yelling at people they'll never meet about issues that don't really matter."
5/14/2010,"this thread seems to have gone off onto a few tangents.it's easy to see why practical-minded players are already attracted to you. the specifics of your theories and examples of your problem solving methods do also give me confidence in you... but not for the position of csm.the csm, from my understanding, is intended to bridge a gap between the players and the devs by consolidating the masses into one (hopefully) coherent voice. i have no doubt in my mind that you could talk shop with the boys in charge. however, the real work of the csm, you must admit, is communicating with the fickle, self-centered, trolling, and often confused player base on order to refine good sense from them. it's political... we vote, after all.i believe you could be quite valuable to us. i encourage you to seek a position in which you may advise the csm and hopefully influence that person with some of your excellent perspective. with no malice what-so-ever, i hope for you and for the rest of us that you do not find you are ill-suited to the role only after you have assumed it."
5/14/2010,"i would suggest you reread the thread with this thought in mind. how i've handled this thread is pretty indicative of my style of managing discussions. consider its signal-to-noise ratio vs. some of the other threads.i think it demonstrates pretty well the manner in which i would work with players to help them refine their ideas into workable proposals that have a shot at serious consideration.as for my ability to deal with a rambunctious player base, you should consider that i've been dealing with rabid anime and film otaku for 20 years while running animeigo.somehow i get the impression that being an advisor to an advisory panel is a little too meta for my tastes.i must admit, however, that i've rarely been told i'm completely unqualified in such a nice a way. i'm sure all your ex-girlfriends still like you."
5/14/2010,"do you have any opinion on api features, i.e. privacy/intel gathering versus convenience? that is, would you support standings information being api verifiable? that is, corps or alliances could pull all their standings from the api, and one could make cool social networking graphs from it.also, what is your position on killmails? a few years ago, killmails were not complete and usually not ccp-verifiable via the api, and many people who played eve did not care about killmails. today, checking killboard activity is one of the best intelligence gathering tools since it shows a complete setup and all involved parties. do you wish to see a return to those days where a large population of eve did not care about looking bad on someone's killboard, and killmails did not contain so much information?"
5/14/2010,"i am returning for a more active role in eve after more than a year hiatus. the war tactic i described was used against my alliance at one time. good to know that it has been changed.i agree with the risk to rewards of low-sec space. however, i disagree with trying to push high-sec players into low-sec. a carrot will work, but a stick will just make people quit.this does not address one main issue of missions in low-sec, the interruption of missions by pirates. do you have any ideas of how to stop pirates engaging mission runners during a mission. when i run a mission, my ship setup is very different from pvp setup. also, pirates tend to scan down the mission runners after the rats have started their engagement. i know eve is not about fair fighting (a lot of the time), but mission runners are seeking predictable situations. again i agree with making low-sec more profitable. but making reducing high-sec is not the way to go. remember the carrot.so let me ask this question. why are rare ores and the level 6 wormholes only found in 0.0? with dominion, sovereignty holders can increase the frequency and quality of both wormholes and mining sites. move some of these 0.0 only things into low-sec to allow non-sovereignty holding corps have access to them.(t)hank(s)"
5/14/2010,supported
5/14/2010,what are your plans into changing or proposing changes to missioning in high sec? what else you think can be added to low sec to make it more desireable for players to get into?
5/14/2010,"my plans on the mission running in highsec are in this thread already. i have stated and will do this again, if needed: they generate too much revenue. too much, because of nonexistent risk. if there would be more risk involved, i would not be advocating removal of level 4 agents from highsec. but as i see now, the removal would be most straightforward and most efficient step to balance highsec mission running with other activities out there. also, there is one flaw in level 5 missions, which allows them to be ran in high security space. it looks like it's overlooked error in the game design, which should be fixed asap. as for the second question, i already wrote, that one of possible changes would be to move all booster production to lowsec. make lowsec into junkie heaven - it would be fun and profitable. also, some of the changes proposed in the assembly hall's ""outlaw"" thread could work too. for example, introduction of lowsec border between some empire factions would be logical and should boost traffic through lowsec. also, i agree, that lowsec could profit from some pirate faction agents there. not much, like level 1, no more than 2. these agents should help people, who want to raise their pirate faction standings and give quite good rewards, even at such low levels. as i wrote in this topic already, i'm tired to see such promising game are as lowsec, to be so barren as it is now. so i'll try to improve it, to be profitable. maybe not as profitable as 0.0 can be, but definitely more profitable than highsec. also, lowsec should have something unique for itself. i'm not completely sure at this point, what it should be. i put here some ideas already, but i'm also open to suggestions. faction wars are nice, but their take place only in few places, while other lowsec systems look like wasteland, deprived of any sign of life. i'm traveling through lowsec quite often and only life i see there, i see in the systems, which border high security space. it's kind of sad, i think. such great potential is wasted."
5/14/2010,"the eve tribune interview is now up, thanks to zarch for getting that out."
5/14/2010,"for someone who is normally a-political in the eve community, i have to admit, that what i've read, seen, and heard both from and about teadaze has impressed me enough to actually cast a vote this time. i hope others feel the same way about putting people in office who will actually work for the community as a whole and not for their own little cliques."
5/14/2010,both elven and vuk are totally worth the votes. they've been a large reason that i've actually kept playing the game up to this point and are some of the most knowledgeable guys about the game. i hope getting both of them back into csm will help push some stuff forward in 0.0 and i'm confident they'll continue to push issues on the things that are truly breaking the game at the moment. i hope others feel the same way and will vote as well.*edited for terrible spelling*
5/14/2010,+1 vote from i
5/14/2010,hope you make it in bud. if i had more than 2 accounts you'd have gotten one of my votes :p
5/14/2010,most matched: t'amber (70%)
5/14/2010,"i see that ccp delayed the patch to work on it further. looks like the csm process works well with all the people campaigning on this issue. i'm not going to say that was the sole reason, but i'll bet they noticed that people want things in a more ""finished"" state."
5/14/2010,"i would also be interested to know how you feel on this matter. i am uncertain there can be any real deterrent against all the different forms that scamming can take, and believe its a wasted sentiment. if you have an idea that would truly keep a social environment like eve honest, however, i'd be very impressed."
5/14/2010,"yeah, that was a missclick. i was in a hurry to get to work. busy weekend for me when they sent out the vote matching notice. i only logged into eve to check and see if i had been contacted, filled out the questionnaire and left for work after a quick look over my responses. i did not see the incorrect choice there. it should have been ""disagree"".i do not like to see people scamming but, i do accept that it is something that can be done in game. that said, scamming suffers from the worst risk/reward ratio. meaning that the scammer gets all the reward and no risk. i do not have any ideas on how to change that situation though.if you have any other questions let me know."
5/14/2010,straight scamming is low risk but it also has a very low success rate. so one could argue that one is basically risking time. but glad that you don't actually want to nerf it.
5/14/2010,"friendly bump for someone who has my vote (well, three votes acutally with alt accounts). also, a big thankyou for taking the time and trouble to help newer players get to grips with one of the best aspects of the game. your guides are enormously helpful, and to anyone wading through the mass of promises offered by the csm candidates and wondering who to vote for i believe that ahina's website proves that she will ""put her money where her mouth is"".good luck."
5/14/2010,"true, but everyone ""risks"" time every time they are in game.flippington bigboy, thanks for your comments and votes."
5/14/2010,"let me go find my thread from csm 1:i'd still prefer a modified borda count (which i think extreme just suggested in a thread on here again), but would be satisfied with a stv system. the reason for that preference is the historically low voter turnout for csm elections - the droop quota for csm 4 would have been 2115 votes, not a single candidate got that amount, the highest was 1553. so basically, not a single candidate would have a 'seat' until they go through multiple rounds of transfers/countbacks. so, stv could work, i just think the borda would be more representative of a 9 person council as it places more weight on the secondary votes than the single vote system. basically, you are voting for a council to represent you, not just a single person.that said, pretty much anything is better than the current voting system.in the meantime, since ccp wants it to remain as a single vote system, the least they could do is change it so you can actually change who you voted for up until the deadline instead of having it locked in."
5/14/2010,"i read the wiki and i think that stv system is way too complex and impossible for people to understand.the only ones that possibly understand how stv vote works are people from the uk, usa, ireland and aussie.i have no idea what a boorda count is, i tried to google it but no info.i would say, keep it simple and for everyone to understand like the eurovision songcontest.ofcourse the eurovision songcontest is no longer what it used to be due to the baltic votes)i think the setup and rules/limitations added as discussed and answered will do the trick."
5/14/2010,"in honor of teadaze's efforts and accomplishments in csm4 and to express our support for his campaign for csm5, agony unleashed is hosting an open seminar night this sunday (may 16th) at 1300 eve time! the topic is an oft-noticed and commented-on part of agony operations: scouting and skirmishing. we'll discuss both the roles themselves as well as how a fleet commander can employ these ""eyes"" to devastating effect, both in gathering and processing intelligence and some dirty tricks involving misdirection and aggression management. our own spinward bound, incidentally one of the best fleet commanders i've ever flown under, will be hosting the chat alongside teadaze with several other agony pilots joining in to provide their own perspectives and field questions as needed. again, this event is free of charge for the whole eve community! there's no need to leave your usual hunting grounds and traipse across the galaxy, either, as there will be no practical portion. this event is entirely hosted on agony unleashed ventrilo.sign-ups can be found here, along with ventrilo connection information. help us anticipate the number of participants by signing up, so we can better accommodate you!show up on sunday and help us honor our friend teadaze, and enjoy the discussion!-weeks"
5/14/2010,"being ""charitable"" with others people money is not quite that hard.but than again he demonstrated that he has no technical knowledge at all, because that's how dbank was ruined (security flaw -> database tampering -> man unable to undo the changes). this guy is not even capable of creating a working signature link. do you really want such a (technically) clueless guy to tell the direction of where eve is going?"
5/14/2010,"i'm quite interested, what do cms members think about each other. especially after you met each other rl during meetings in iceland. who stood out, who had the best ideas, who was most active, who was most useless (and so ...) during your cms turn.ps: please don't turn this into ankhbasdksfiokah bash-fest."

5/15/2010,"i read a few posts so i apologize ahead of time if i'm repeating anything anyone has said. i've noticed people saying that if the damage is increased then gallente would be too powerful upclose. however, we all do agree that something has to be done with the damage. i mean even with void which only does the -25% range instead of the antimatter(also faction) -60%, the maximum range even with falloff is between 12km and 16km.i would much love for them to increase the damage output outright but then we run into everyone just switching to close gank gallente. if they lower everyones resists to meet the damage output then that doesn't only help gallente out it helps everyone which in turn gets us back to square one. i would suggest of a complete system overhall, which would take way too long and too many resources, but it would be nice to have a completely different combat system. where you have points to put in whichever resists you want and whatnot but thats for another post of maybe even for eve ii. who knows.my suggestion to have gallente ships naturally resisted to the speed reduction of webs and scrams. while increasing their tracking, agility, and normal speed values.this would fix both problems and be pretty simple but i have a feeling everyone is going to say its overpowered. with the mobility amarr lasers and minmater guns would be at a disadvantage because of the movement causing their already low tracking to hurt them in the long run, which would in the end require more pilot capability to even out the transversal when attacking. the other condition would be the webs and scrams, it doesn't help if we can't get in range. if gallente ships were resisted to webs and scrams speed reductions to a degree then it would help with the range problems. gallente speed value can only be reduced to 80% of their total speed value. so if the top speed with an ab is 500 then speed doesn't drop below 400 regardless of the amounts of webs on the ship. same thing with scrams'. speed can not be lower then 80% of total speed value. if the tracking, speed values, and agility were to increase to meet these needs then i think the whole issue is solved.i know this all sounds a little crazy, more then welcome to omit or change things, but i think it leads to a good direction. this all plays more into pilot capabilities while giving us the tools we need to make up for the horrible damage output. we stay out of low transversal lowering the damage output on us while keeping our damage output pretty much the same. this way everyone damage overall is the same only thing that changes is the mechanic.well thats it for now. i hope i made some sense. i post when i'm dead tired and i always pray it sounds the way i planned it too."
5/15/2010,"even with 20% raw dps increase i don't see a real point in it, even before qr blaster ships where at least 10% dps short to overcome similar flown\fitted ships by pure dps advantage at her range(ehp\dps wise). the damage is also split into drones and guns so it is mostly a 12-16% boost for most ships.strong point of most good solo ships is not the dps, it is the flexibility and the ability to leave next to no weaknesses in the offensive and defensive capability to prevent other ships from using them against your(ability to deal with small stuff, some kind of gtfo ability, ability to prevent/counter kitting, not losing all ability's if you get neuted, ability to dedicate range).while blaster ships where not capable of doing some of this things they still had solid mix of it, enough to make them work. that changed with qr.i'm quite happy with using ak ships as damage dealers atm, dps difference is not this big after putting selectable damage types in and using the bigger range window. - a bit more speed/agility would be nice, but you will still lose the fights you would lose today so no big change.- what exactly do you think is ""nuts high dps""? also you still end up with a limited damage dealer for smaller gangs instead of a flexible solo ship.- we already got aks/lasers for this.- meh"
5/15/2010,do you even do a cursory glance at what happens to the ships with you make your proposed changes? this is a serious question.
5/15/2010,i think we need to think of something a little more interesting than just fiddling with the range/damage of rails.i still think a penetration mechanic can be balanced and give rails that second tactical advantage.beams have raw damage (dps) and exceptional trackingarties have selectable damage types (yes close range but meh) and extreme alpharails only have range. and then that range advantage is only seen on selected caldari ships.
5/15/2010,"it has been proven that damage penetration cannot be balanced in any conventional sense of the word. you might be able to make it such that it won't be ridiculously overpowered in the extreme situations, but in doing so you'll make rails utterly useless in the average case. i'll take my regular joe damage boost please.also, i encourage you to take a look at the optimal of a sniper mega vs optimal of a tempest. and don't give me none of that ""but you operate in falloff!!!!!!"" crap.-liang"

5/15/2010,"then they should not have introduced field command ships, because fleet command ships cover that role completely.they introduced so much stuff in the meantime, anyway, that boosting cs is really in order, particularly the horribad ones (hi astarte). them being able to sport a warfare link (which is sleipnir and abso only anyway and abso has problems doing it) is a nice thing for a small gang, but said small gang also needs a ship which performs in direct combat.large gangs will never use the field cs in boosting role since fleet does it 11ty billion times better. then again, i'm ok with them being trash too, since they salvage well and sometimes drop faction loot , ideal loot pinatas and preety easy to kill on top."
5/15/2010,"i support the thread in the sense that they need a boost.however, i think fon tunes them in a better direction: normally in eve ships have a role. ccp try to balance things around that, create things around that, and that's the whole concept behind them. what's common between these ships?* they were, on creation, very nice balanced between tank and gank. your survivability let you outlast opponents while having a quite respectable damage output.-> that has changed through the years. the introduction of rigs, and inflation in skillpoints/isk, combined with alot more pilots nowadays, as well as the totalhelldeath of active tanking has killed this.i'd like to see some love in general to active tanking, that would sort these ship out partially, as well as a multitude of other ships. at the end of the day, these ships should be able to tank, while doing respectable damage, and should have enough fitting over to throw on a ganglink. these are not big scale fleet ships, but should be shining in small- and medium scale."

5/15/2010,"this is actually a pretty simple idea. the idea is that you can take a group of waypoints, set a particular constraint, and then optimize them. a constraint might be that a particular system comes last, for example. as it stands, there isn't really a way to do this. if you optimize and then put something to the bottom, you won't have the best path. an example that i ran into earlier today:starting in pemene, we want to go to mesybier, duripant, villore, eglennaert, dodixie, and finally aunia. pressing optimize with these waypoints set we get:mesybiervilloredodixieeglennaertauniaduripantwhich is a 15 jump route. it is also mostly useless, because now we are 5 jumps from aunia, where we want to be. however, if you put aunia to the bottom now, you do not get the most efficient route; the route you get (simply switching aunia and duripant above) is 18 jumps. with a little trial and error i constructed this route, which is 16 jumps:mesybiervilloreduripanteglennaertdodixieauniathe idea behind this proposal is that we shouldn't have to do trial and error like that, but should instead be able to set aunia as our 6th destination and optimize the other 5 waypoints. at a minimum we should be able to set our last waypoint to be something in particular, because situations like the above (where i did some shopping before going to my agent) are not especially uncommon. situations where we want to set a 3rd waypoint out of 6 are probably less common."

5/15/2010,"it might be worth pointing out that eve online is one of the only mmorpgs which totally supports the sort of gratuitous griefing which you are currently having a problem with. this results in two things. first, individuals who enjoy this sort of gameplay (the ""non-consentual"" types) usually find their way to eve via the usual methods: banned from other games, left other games due to reputation, etc. secondly, these same individuals tend to go overboard on the griefing, especially if the consequences for said actions are lacking.that being said, you're in a tough spot. because i doubt ccp is going to change non-consentual pvp. not because they think its funny when you're ridiculed and abused to the point where you can't log in, but because changing it would break the physical game mechanics of combat in eve. remember, npc pirates engage you ""non-consentually"" as well. personally, i feel that griefing has seriously tarnished this game's previous levels of awesome. there is a difference between pirates and griefers. lastly, i would just like to point out that i have caught a number of people using wow references to their griefing, which only substantiates my theory that many of said griefers are actually ""immigrants"" to eve.however, wardecs are unique and give small corps a chance to get their feet wet in combat, and fyi wardecs are never mutual, because making someone pay for war is another form of isk attrition."

5/15/2010,"if this was a rare event or something else ok then killmails are a great thing to hand out as proof of your being at the event. but these ""events"" happen every few hours.but i am supporting this proposal because killmails are supposed to be a record of your pvp activities and pvp record. they serve as confirmation of a player kill as without a killmail we devolve into ""i killed you! nah-uh, no you didn't!""the main problem is that npcs are far inferior to pilots. killing a npc that is spawned for you and doesn't web/scram you and doesn't focus fire and flies a terribly fit ship is miles below the average player fits. sleepers are far harder and do not give out killmails.even worse is that the carriers that are spawned in lowsec drop fighters and capital sized modules. why are pvp killmails and pvp loot being given out to players for pve activities? is this a major shift from ccp, are we getting away from actual pvp and moving towards battlegrounds and more pve? these new live events just do not make sense. i'm confused to as why you are changing 7 years of killmails being from pvp. it lacks consistency, why not give out killmails for missions and mining and exploration and trading?giving out what are basically free killmails to people devaules all killmails as they are simple to get so it does impact other players. the reward for rp should be rp items and the fact that you actually get to rp in a live event."
5/15/2010,"would it hurt you people to actually research stuff before vomiting the stuff above from their mouths?you don't get npc killmails. the ships are controlled by players, albeit dev players, that give killmails. the only thing that is skewing efficiency is that they are currently using sansha faction battleships - but you can hardly expect sanshas to show up in armageddons, now.if we're about not giving killmails because the ships aren't ""properly fitted"" (fyi, the ships have generally a huge buffer tank and no weapons other than nos's/neuts - i don't know about the carriers as i haven't seen them, i think they have fighters though?), let's not also give killmails for suicide ganks and industrials, noobships, etc. i mean, they can't be properly pvp fitted, why should you get credit for such kills?"

5/15/2010,"the killmails allow people to see how those ships are fitted. the fits on those ships are so horrible you'd think they pulled random strangers off the street and put them in charge of these events. it is proof that the people running the events have very little understanding of the combat system.frankly, it is utter incompetence. it is yet another proof that ccp have no understanding of eve combat system, and therefore they can not be trusted with game balancing decisions.how can someone fitting their ship like that, have any understanding of the problems blaster ships have right now? and even get an inkling of what's wrong with rockets?sure, maybe these are only the low level people who are incompetent, but they have superiors who have to approve their action. if any superior approved of this, he's just as incompetent as they are. i vote yes on hiding the killmails, at least to reduce the stress i feel when i see how much ccp fails."
5/15/2010,"i seriously ****ing hope you're trolling. the fits are bad because the ships aren't meant to kill as many players possible, but to survive as long as possible - ergo they have nearly nothing else but armor plates or shield extenders + equivalent rigs and resist modifiers."

5/15/2010,"back when i was a young and innocent newbie, i used to think you took damage when your ship collided with another. what's more, i thought this was cool as hell. in fact, i still do. i would assume that this is something that is possible to implement given that the mechanics for bumping already exist (although they are slightly dodgy at times). before i talk about how i envisage this working, i want to address the most obvious problem; how you deal with this in empire space. for high security space, i would say the most elegant solution is that when another ship is collided with, a check is made to see if it is a valid target - a wartarget, a corpmate, someone you have killrights for, or someone with aggression for whatever reason - and if they are not, the target is merely bumped as in the current system, with no damage occurring (""your shipborne ai overrides your controls at the last second, narrowly avoiding disaster"").for low security space, how this would be implemented is trickier; imagine a frigate accidentally bumping someone on a station undock and being insta-popped by sentry guns . i would suggest that ramming can only take place on grids that do not have sentry guns on them (assuming this is possible to implement), otherwise the same thing occurs as in hi-sec. however in a situation where ramming can occur, the ramming party receives gcc.so how would this work? the last paragraph implies it is possible to distinguish between the rammer and the rammee. this is how i envisage things going:- the ramming ship's speed must be over a certain threshhold (as a percentage of its maximum with a mwd active - i would suggest perhaps 50% but of course am open to suggestions) in order to trigger collision damage. this is to ensure that the majority of collisions are the result of genuine attempts to do so, avoiding the loss of 100 fleet bs when half of them fail to align when the fc tells them to.- damage would be inflicted to both parties, determined by: the speeds of both ships, the directions of travel of both ships and the masses of both ships. i think this is best illustrated through a few examples. first of all, lets say a frigate is moving at very slow speed (perhaps scrammed and webbed) and machariel (a ship possessing both very high mass and high speed) bumps it from the rear (what parts of ships collide can be determined simply by looking at their direction of travel, and i think this would add a very cool tactical element to positioning your ship during combat) whilst moving at maximum speed with its mwd overloaded. the machariel would suffer merely a blip on its shields, while the frigate would suffer huge damage (exploding in a huge ball of fire, out of which the mach emerges, pilot grinning manically). now imagine the same machariel, this time with an identical ship coming straight at it, with them colliding head on, both moving at top speed. in this case, there isn't really a rammer and rammee, just two maniacs, who would both suffer equal damage. as they are both taking the blow from the front, the damage would not be so catastrophic. indeed the raw amounts of damage that will be inflicted will be something that needs to be carefully balanced, however anyone whos ever tried to bump a moving ship at high speed (trying to stop someone burning back to a gate for example) knows it is rather tricky, so i feel this would not become the only way in which people tried to resolve combat! a final example; our trusty mackrel is now sitting stationary, revelling in his glory. the frigate pilot returns in a brand new merlin, ready to enact revenge. he overloads his mwd and rams straight into the rear of the mach, and... explodes. hence even with careful ship positioning and a well timed mwd burst, i believe an overwhelmingly larger ship opposing you should lead to rather spectacular failure. to be continued..."
5/15/2010,"what does this add to the game? firstly, it is undeniably cool, and i believe would be great fun, primarily for pvpers, but i'm sure the imaginative ratter will have fun with this too (patrolling hisec belts in a nano-cruiser, ramming the frigate rats to death perhaps).secondly, it adds another aspect to combat; another way in which fights can somehow be won leads to a whole family of tactics and strategies to develop, furthering enriching the gameplay experience, allowing more diversity in the way people play the game, and adding another way for highly skilled pilots to distinguish themselves. in conclusion, i believe that whilst there are balance issues (is there any aspect of the game that is free from these?) i have laid out a way in which this can be implemented that adds to rather than detracts from the core gameplay, and i hope have convinced you that this would be a really fun thing to have in the game."

5/15/2010,"unfortunately, this will immediately get exploited for isk gain unless ccp introduces some type of real penalty for suicides."
5/15/2010,"the proposal is to introduce voice commands that could be triggered via keyboard and mouse sequences. this type of interface has been used in team-based fps games. in eve, the voice command interface may allow for better, faster, more structured fleet and other types of communications.how it works:each pilot would chose one of a few pre-recorded voices to represent them in the game. then, using their keyboard and mouse, they would chose options which would in turn speak to your fleet using the selected voice. the spoken commands would also be displayed in the fleet chat.keyboard shortcuts could be used for generic commands such as ""tackle the primary"", ""regroup at my location"", or ""command acknowledged"", while right-clicking an enemy or friendly ships or other objects could be used to issue object-specific commands useful in assigning primary targets, alerting of new contacts, or designating retreat location. voice commands will not be able to pronounce the names, but the name would be displayed in chat.a practical example:battle begins. the fleet commander activates the voice menu by pressing v, then selects m for ""movement"", then j for the command ""jump in now!"". may sound complicated, but it's very quick to press v-m-j, especially once you know the commands by heart. the fleet would hear this pre-recorded command, and would also see it in chat. next, the commander assigns the primary by right-clicking an enemy ship, and clicking ""assign as primary"". fleet would hear something like ""primary target is the damnation at 40"". chat would display this command, along with the ship name. additionally, the primary could also be marked somehow, maybe different color reticle or what not. options are endless here because eve knows what your command was!a fleet member notices an enemy reinforcement fleet, and presses v-a-n (voice-alert-new contacts), which alerts the fleet: ""new contacts spotted!""commander presses v-m-r (voice-movement-run) which directs the fleet to ""run, run, run, scatter!!!"".this is a just simple example to give you an idea.advantages:useless chatter greatly minimized.eliminates language/accent barriers.ability to see all communications in chat as well. this is huge for many reasons. some examples: you won't miss any communications during bathroom break, you won't have to ask someone to repeat if you misunderstood, you can turn off sound if desired.commands could also trigger other events such as highlighting the primary for the fleet.more realism because of pre-recorded voices. (as opposed to hearing actual voices which just reminds you that you're online with 5th graders and creepy basement-dwellers)no need for 3rd party software or servers for voice communication and therefore less setup time and less bandwidth loss.your youtube videos will sound as good as the ccp trailers!disadvantages:main disadvantage would have to be the fact that you cannot speak ""free-form"". it would fall on ccp to ensure that they make the command interface elaborate enough to accommodate any situation. also, nothing is stopping you from using your mic too, you just have more options.the usefulness of this feature would depend on implementation. things like clunky or overly complex interface, lack of command variety, or bad voice acting may deter people from using it.potential performance degradation. since eve servers would have to relay the messages to the fleet (just the message code, the voice would be stored on the client), it would have performance implications. overuse would have to be controlled via spam timers etc.please voice your support and feel free to post ideas that may make this better."

5/15/2010,"i'm sure for vets of the game and even noobs, everyone misses that oh wow factor some aspects of the game had when it was more new. nobody had battleships let alone titans, so seeing things like this added that 'oh wow' factor to things. now obviously that's impossible to bring back to eve in that form as the game is now. i do however propose a way to bring a bit of it back.really simple, why not toss a little randomness into the mundane.missions, mining, etc, are all far to predictable. not that there shouldn't be some level of predictability, but why not throw a little randomness into the mix to keep things interesting. it's what keeps people interested in every day life, the little things that are familiar but a bit different that make you step back if only for a moment and go, oh cool.so the to the point version of my idea...-mining, why shouldn't some rare rock occasionally spawn in a belt, so some dumb luck miner gets a little extra. also as you head out to mine there is a bit of that what if today is my lucky day factor.-missions, why not have some of the faction npcs occasionally spawn similar to belts, or have something about the mission in general be a little more random variable.-faction warfare- why not have some random npc fleets even if only on small scale to prevent node death engage each other on occasion.-tech advances- far to predictable, why should it not come from predictable routes but on occasion slip into more unpredictable avenues, such as missions, ratting, etc.-story driven events- just random storyline driven events that pop up every now and again that actually happen in space.i'm over simplifying a much larger project i realize...you could pretty much do a whole expansion on just making things in eve a bit more randomized to kill some of the mundane that has crept into any long running mmo. i think my point overall though is if in any avenue your playing the game through, there was even just a little bit of random variation to it, it'd make all avenues a lot more interesting."
5/15/2010,i honestly think that the csm should push for this in the next expansion. the one after tyrannis should focus on breathing new life into the game.

5/15/2010,bombing tactics are valid and they work. noone will sit in a paper tanked ship and just let you shoot at them if they can help it.i am sick of people like you trying to ruin hard work. so are they going to ban you ?what are you doing going to 0.0 in a noob corp ?how did you make 100 friends ?and how did you convince 100 noob corp people to come to a place that had a jump bridge ?post with your main or stfu.

5/15/2010,if you read the forums for last couple weeks you'd notice that emo tj has began trolling this forum with nonsensical threads.why don't you remove his trolls? and send him a warning while you are at it.
5/15/2010,wouldnt it be nice if we could inject a skiil while we are training the prerequisites for it?example: you are training electronics v and have 2 hours left on it. the next skill you want to train is cyno. but youre leaving town within the next hour and are going to be gone from eve for 2 days. you get to miss all that time from your queue! congrats!
5/15/2010,i know this might be too obvious ... but ... train something else in the meantime?
5/15/2010,but i want my cyno alt ready by the time i get back
5/15/2010,training other races frigates/haulers helps. ;)always nice when you got a wide choice for cyno ships. :)
5/15/2010,"it's already been requested and refused by ccp. there's consistency issues with someone starting a requisite, injecting a skill, and then changing their queue. i'd like it(or something like it), but it's not possible."

5/15/2010,it will help alleviate (albeit slightly) the already heavyily burdened low slot configuration for armor tankers. as it is now the utility output on lows for shield tank far outweighs the utility output on mids for armor tank. anything that will open up low slots for armor tankers would be a great improvement. cap chargers should reduce armor boost as does relay shield. give us armor amps!
5/15/2010,diversity is good for the game. so no we dont need to make all slot stuff the same.also ... if you move the propulsion upgrades to the mids ... where do you put the ewar stuff?about the armor amps... you got 1 rig for that.shield tanker lack that rig but got a module instead.all in all ... your proposal is mixing like 4-5 things.... none of the idea seems to be thought through ... so nothing to support.
5/15/2010,"yeah i forgot about not having shield boost rigs. soo... make one.as for ewar being squished by a total of 3 modules, i really dont see a game changer here. more like a game balancer."

5/15/2010,no. just no.
5/15/2010,"a no with me as well. i will go even further: low slots could use the passive modules, and med slots the active ones, so expanders and cap bats would move to lows, while dcu and armor reppers could go to mids. this will free up slots for both armor and shield tankers, and make sense from the gallente point of view: you'll actually use your active armor bonusses.i have not yet thought this through enough to make a full blooded proposal, as this will require a lot of recalculated modules."
5/15/2010,no
5/15/2010,"i'm fine with special event people dropping t2 loot if they actually fly competently and not have lolfits on their ships.if they organize themselves into strong gangs that cay lay waste to at least a few carebear battleships, then the loot is well earned."
5/15/2010,"t2 loot has always been produced by players and now npc's have more control of an aspect of the game that they barely touched before. if ccp wants to reduce the value of t2 bpo's then they should directly address that issue directly instead of devaluing all t2 blueprints, whether invented copies or bpo's won in the lottery."
5/15/2010,ephemeron is quite known here. you just discredit yourself.
5/15/2010,"people will whine about anything these days, are seriously complaining about some t2 items dropping during a special event that happens once in a blue moon?eph is his main and he has about a bajillion kills so try again"
5/15/2010,"obviously i stood corrected and fixed my post. caldari provisions is usually a pretty obvious alt troll corp. :pbut yeah, t2 items shouldn't drop from ships not flown by actual players, even if a ccp employee is behind the computer while they're being flown. eve is different from almost every other mmo out there because the players have a large influence on the game, whether it be pew pew pvp or the economy."
5/15/2010,"if it was possible to grind these ships, then yes, they shouldn't drop t2. however, since they're special events, a status which precludes the ability to grind them, then the mods dropped by those ships will have an infinitesimally small impact on the t2 market."
5/15/2010,"you're clearly unfamiliar with old live events. you think t2 loot is bad, try to wrap your head around an event that drops an opux luxury yacht. it's fine."
5/15/2010,"this is one of those threads that once again prove eve player base can, and will whine for just about everything.there is what, 4-6 of these pc battleships - yes only the actor ships drop t2 loot - destroyed daily and they ""drop"" around 3-5 t2 mods each. usually t2 shield extenders or such. these live events won't be happening constantly however, so color me not very confident that these few t2 shield extenders will collapse the t2 market. as the poster above me said, live events of the past ""dropped"" unique ships like the opux luxury yacht, worth billions of isk. are you fine with that then?"
5/15/2010,tbh i understand his case - and i wouldn't mind it if they only dropped named and faction loot.
5/15/2010,"we all know that adding certificates for players didn't really do much for the game. my idea is for expanding certificates for use by corporations. here's the concept:for pvp corporations, a certificate would give information about killmails generated per month. certifications could vary based on the type of ships in the killmails, so you might get on for capital engagement-advanced for killing 4 or more capital ships within a monthfor industrial corporations, a certificate would give information about ships/modules completed per month. certifications could vary based on the type of ships/modules built, so you might get capital construction-advanced for building 2 or more capital ships within a month.discussion: allowing this type of information to be more accessible could add new dimensions to political and strategic play. alliances and players would be able to consolidate capabilities and compete in targeted ways. some alliances may seek to dominate certain portions of the market or grow their pvp base in a specific area and create a battle strategy as a result. this concept is currently used in rl by corporations all over the world. they may acquire a corporation to improve their market share in anticipation of growing demand or acquire another corporation to reduce competition in a certain market. this would also be a good step toward making corporations actually behave like corporations in rl. now all we would need is public balance sheets and a public shares system and players could simulate corporations completely."
5/15/2010,"pvp corps have killboards for this.i'd have to imagine most industrial corps would be hesitant to announce that they routinely produce capital ships (and thus routinely have freighter-loads of capital parts moving around) to those seeking juicy highsec targets to declare war on.if the intention is to make it easier for alliances to gauge the utility of the corp they're recruiting...well, an indy corp's failure to produce sufficient ships for their alliance provides just as good a 'service record'. i can't see adding certificates at a corporate level being of any more concrete use than those at a player level."
5/15/2010,"your not thinking then.killboards are used by alliances. i know. that information has to be sifted through, however. industrial corps might not want to have capital construction information available either. but it is a corp right?the difference between the mafia families and corporations is only the legitimacy of how they make profit. legitimacy requires transparency. i mentioned this idea to someone in game and he said the same thing about industrialists not wanting to disclose capital production information. but think about it a little more, if you were able to see what certificates each corp had, you could recruit much more effectively. and if your corp had vast capital production capability or pvp prowess you would be a hot commodity. and this requires a lot less digging. new forms of epionage and more strategic gameplay would result."
5/15/2010,"people managed to train without daily access to their pcs for years before the skill queue existed. i used to work away from my home pc 5 days from 7 and i just made sure i was training something that lasted for the time i was away.people have been proposing extensions to the training queue since it appeared, provoking reactions like ""give them a finger..."" above. 24 hour skill queue is perfectly sufficient, especially as you can tweak the skill queue to last longer by adding short skills to the front of it while a longer skill is training.tl;dr - no support. unnecessary change."
5/15/2010,she did not say she was employed by ccp.
5/15/2010,"you voiced the same lie and then when i pointed out that, in her own words, ank claimed that ccp employed her for, among other things, ""game design"". and when that's pointed out to you, you just go back to the original fiction that's just been refuted and claim again that when she says she's employed by ccp for ""game design"", she didn't say that. again, who are we going to believe, ank's own words or your claims about ank's own words? obviously we can't believe her if her words disagree with your claims. so ank's own words, posted by herself, are ""distorted"" and ""opinion"". oh yeah, and ank is many people and her own words, that she wrote, represent a ""conspiracy"" against her.it's an interesting game you (a person who just so happens to be parroting all of ank's dodges but never supported or really heard about her before just now) are playing. and one that (what luck!) just happens to repeat all the dodges that ank is using. that ank has to rely on supporters, or alts, like this just shows that the accusations are 100% true."
5/15/2010,m8 i downloaded and read her cv. she did not say she was employed by ccp. so who is lying?
5/15/2010,"you're repeating the same lie and over and over and over. why? and rather obviously, people can posting personal information is not allowed on our forums.applebabevery first entry under ""employment history"" (ya know, those things that you're employed at?)... is ccp games, where ank claims that the csm constituted employment (even though ccp had her sign a document which explicitly stated she was not employed by them). she also claims that her ""employment"" at ccp consisted of, among other things ""game design"", something that only paid and hired ccp employees (developers) actually engage in."
5/15/2010,m8 i understand what you are trying to say. it is common for volunteer work to be listed in your employment history. this doesnt mean you were employed by them. eva wasnt lying when she listed her volunteer work under her employment history.i will say again. eva did not say she was employed by ccp.
5/15/2010,"thank you for a well-mannered discussion. i did not expect this.obviously, we differ in our interpretation/judgement of her wordings/self-representation/whatchamacallit, and i think this is a good point to leave it at that since i'm quite sure none of us can or wants to convince to other side at all costs - i made my best to point out my opinion as clear and rational as possible, and i got the same impression from you - the rest is up to the voters to decide, and i expect ankh to be voted into the next csm.cheerio."
5/15/2010,"i like it when you're reduced to contradicting yourself one sentence to the next. do you even read your own lies before you post them, just to see how laughable they are? your dodge is that while she said she was employed by ccp, she didn't really mean it because other people list non-employment under volunteer work. yet again, ""employment history"" sorta, i don't know, points to things that you are ""employed"" for in your ""history"". what're the odds?!?!?no, no dodges now about ""well, in lower mongolia..."" or ""well, in the uk..."" ccp, in specific, had csm members sign documents which explicitly said that they were not being hired by ccp. to turn around and call that ""employment"" (oh, i'm sorry, we can't trust ank's own words when she says she was employed by ccp because even though she said she was employed by ccp, people often put down non-employment as employment). to say nothing of the fact that she claimed that, while employed by ccp, she was employed doing ""game design"" among other things. something of course which the csm positions do not entail, at all."
5/15/2010,"ank's claims disagree with the netherland's own civil law on employment. saying that it's considered ""employment"" in micronesia has little bearing on the matter. on one hand, we have ank's own words saying that her terms on the csm constituted employment with ccp. on the other, we have people saying that ank saying that her terms on the csm constituted employment with ccp doesn't count as ank saying that her terms on the csm constituted employment with ccp. i mean, honestly, ank says ""employment history: ccp"".and some people respond ""see, she didn't just say that ccp is part of her employment history."""
5/15/2010,"if you take a step back and a good breather from your prolific forum witch hunts and rantings, you do realize how much you are sounding like glenn beck, don't you? even down to the conspiranoid ank-is-going-to-destroy-eve weeping and doomsday sensationalization... quite fitting, since eve tribune is turning into the fox news of eve."
5/15/2010,"you can address the facts any time now, or just troll harder. you're not very good at trolling though, i'd suggest growing a spine."
5/15/2010,this is not a contradiction neither am i lying. it is common to list volunteer work under your employment history. by doing this you are not making a statement that you have been a contractual employee. this must be frustrating for you to understand but unfortunately is true. no. she didnt say she was employed by ccp. she is perfectly entitled to list her volunteer work under her employment history.you are not obliged to solely put contractual employment in your employment history.i have no knowledge of any document that eva may or may not have signed with ccp. this sounds very similar in context to a paragraph you may find in a volunteer agreement. yet again she did not state she was an employee of ccp. yet again volunteer work is commonly listed in your employment history. this one is a little subjective. this would be something to discuss with an employer and would serve no purpose discussing it here.
5/15/2010,"i see, you just really like lying. not all employment is contractual but, get this, all employment is, go figure, employment. again, who'd a thunk it? it doesn't matter if people ""not employment"" under the ""employment"" section of a resume. get this ""not employment"" isn't ""employment"" even if you say it is. i know, who'd a thunk it? i do admit though, i like these lies of yours. i can say i was employed in any number of jobs, but because people, somewhere on earth, put down not-employment as employment, i'm not saying it's employment. i'll change my resume right now. would you suggest that i should say i was employed as a secret agent, or just as the president of the united states? ""it is common for the yano mamo to consider beating a woman until she is disfigured by scars to be an act of love. therefore, when someone beats the **** out of their wife it's not really abuse.""or even better ""he didn't abuse his wife, he just beat the **** out of her. this is not a contradiction and neither am i lying."" yes it is, and yes you are. i've already cited this, and everybody can see you're lying. instead of saying that when she listed it under ""employment history"" she didn't actually list it under ""employment history"" (which is an obvious lie) why don't you just claim that she listed it under employment history but really she meant something else. that at least isn't laughable. and again you show that your job (oh, wait, put that down on your resume under employment) here is to defend ank with any degree of dishonesty at all. it's ""subjective"" as to whether or not people voicing their opinions are really engaged in ""game design"" as a part of their employment with ccp? damn, i too have provided suggestions on the forums, i guess in addition to being the president of the united states, i should also list that i'm a game designer. hrmm... ccp never paid me for my employment as a game designer. maybe i should follow ank's example and contemplate legal action?honestly though, your lies really are awesome. ""she didn't say she was employed by ccp.""""right there, she lists ccp under her employment history.""""she didn't say she was employed by ccp.""""right there, there, in black and white.""""doesn't count""""...what?""""lots of people list things that aren't employment, as employment."" ""does that mean that they're not listing them as employment?""""well... no.""""so they're listing them as employment?""""yes.""""so she was saying she was employed by ccp.""""no, it doesn't count, because lots of people list things that aren't employment, as employment."" here's a hint. there are two different phrases ""work history"" and ""employment history"". guess which one means the history of things you've been employed to do, and which means everything you've worked at whether or not it was something you were employed at?"
5/15/2010,this really is where the problem lies for you.in evas cv she has an employment history. in this section she is perfectly entitled to list any volunteer work. you do not have to solely list contractual employment.you see ccp listed under her employment history and you believe this is a statement by eva that she has been a contractual employee of ccp. uhm. no.actually people can see that you are talking out of your arse. keep it going evas votes double every time you post more of your nonsense.
5/15/2010,"ahhh, should've looked you up first. i'm sorry ank, you a bit upset? obvious alt is obvious."
5/15/2010,listing volunteer work under your employment history isnt a statement that you were a contractual employee. get it yet?no. this is a cv. this not a contract. you may pretty much put anything you want to under your employment history.no. she did not state she was an employee. you are correct. you are perfectly entitled to list both in your employment history.
5/15/2010,"just stop lying. try it, you may like it. i never said it was ""contractual"" employment, that's just your lie. you can't quote me saying that, because you're making it up. i pointed out that it's not employment of any sort, and that ccp specified the same exact thing. i'd expect you to say that. and then to lie and say that putting it there doesn't mean you're claiming it's part of your employment history. but as long as you're posting to the thread with more dishonesty, ank, please explain how you're totally against removing term limits and to prove how against them you are, you're going to immediately take advantage of them. that's almost as good as ""i just said i was employed, i didn't say i was employed!"""
5/15/2010,anyone is entitled to put volunteer work in their employment history. this is not a lie.you are however making me laugh.
5/15/2010,post with your main.
5/15/2010,"so the other i went down to my local church and helped serve homeless people some piping hot soup. shall i list the vatican as an employer? you're right people are entitled to list volunteer work on there resumes, they just usually list it as, get this, volunteer work.people bs on resumes, this is pretty much a given. however, you weren't involved in ""game design"" anymore than i would be if i started a features and ideas thread. also, post with your main troll."
5/15/2010,"finn, while i agree with most of what you're saying, you aren't winning yourself any friends. calling people liars and flinging poop doesn't convert people to your side, even if they are liars and do deserve to have poop flung at them. yeah, it's fun, but it doesn't actually serve your purposes."
5/15/2010,"this is how i look at it: -most folks are capable of reading the evidence objectively and seeing what ank has said in her own words, they'll make their decisions based on the evidence. -other folks are capable of reading the evidence objectively, and then seeing how ank has tried to handwave it away and the dodges she's used, and they'll make their decision about her trustworthiness that way. -and a totally different set of folks won't read the evidence because ank tells them not to, or they'll simply discard any evidence that isn't flattering of ank. the first two groups will have already made their minds up, upon reading the evidence, without requiring a debate to choose. the third will have made their minds up before reading the evidence, and they won't require facts to choose. i'd wager that 99.9% of people, actually, will make up their own minds regardless of the arguments anybody in this thread makes, and they'll only decide based on the facts presented and not what people say about them. i'm not really trying (or caring) about making friends so much as i'm enjoying pointing out some folks' behavior. most people, when presented with a situation, will form their own judgments and it will be the introduction of new facts, not other opinions about the facts, that will change their minds. this isn't persuasive writing, this is ranting. oh yeah, and there's a fourth group of people, too. alts who are most likely ank."
5/15/2010,"to be honest the deal about the resume is a minor point. i devote one paragraph to that, and somehow that's what everyone's talking about. but even without the dubious resume ankh is simply far and away the worst candidate currently standing. her own statements prove it--and the most anyone can muster to defend them is to accuse the people quoting her of trolling. pathetic.ps: <3 lady spank"
5/15/2010,"1) agreed that it's minor, but it's also rather elucidative. rather than just say ""yeah, i was padding my resume and i wasn't really employed by ccp and i wasn't really designing game content for them."" (which i think all of us would have understood and most would have excused), ank chose to use an alt to argue for why she didn't even do what she clearly did.2) and of course it's the focus, because ank won't address her own quotes, in her own words, made on her own character, that show what she thinks of pvpers and how she'd ruin the game if she got half a chance. she's actually done her best to brush them all aside and her supporters have, in turn, done their best to keep discussion away from anything substantive. point out ank's own words, and it's a ""smear"" that she won't address, her supporters will merely parrot her dodge (and it goes without saying that her alts will too). that's totally not true. they can also accuse people of inventing the quotes, of 'nitpicking', of being on a crusade, of 'smearing' ank, and a host of other dodges. it's like they've got a new thesaurus and, goddamn, they're going to use it!"
5/15/2010,eva stated in her covering letter that i have been an elected council member of eve onliness council of stellar management this should be clear.most people are clear that her cv is perfectly acceptable. you are choosing to argue about it. you are also making a complete fool out of yourself.
5/15/2010,"post with your main.also, stop talking about yourself in the third person ank, it's kinda weird."
5/15/2010,"yes, it's a person who has only ever commented on these issues. it could just as easily be an offended lurker as an alt. it's not like she doesn't have die-hard supporters, after all."
5/15/2010,"true. although i see no real reason for someone who's already on the record as supporting her to keep supporting her via an alt. but using an alt account to defend yourself does have advantages. it's true that until it posts with its main we don't know for sure who it is, but it seems much more likely that it's ank logging on to defend herself than someone else, who's already defended her on another account, logging that one in. especially since ank hasn't been posting since the alt has been."
5/15/2010,"yeah, but ank has been ignoring any detractors since about page 7. and this is one case where npc corps don't always imply alts - she actually has supporters there. i'm not saying it's not an alt. obviously, it could be. but it's silly to assume that you know for sure."
5/15/2010,"or, maybe it's a noob alt of someone who is not in a npc corp but just does not want ppl to know who their main is. ppl do that you know"
5/15/2010,it's almost like there was a second paragraph on my post that said exactly that.
5/15/2010,"with the amount of propaganda and outright lies she is spamming into mission and trade hubs of late she's guaranteed to get on the csm. she's implying that every other csm candidate wants to move level 4 missions to low sec. while her filthy smear effort is blatant to anyone reading this thread, the majority of people under her carpet-bombing of local spam and emails will just take it at face value and pass their vote to her.i find this to be disgusting behaviour for someone who is supposed to be representing the player base."
5/15/2010,posting in an epic thread of lolz! i voted for ankh.
5/15/2010,"its only for csm for **** sake, ccp arent going to take everyone of her ideas and implement them even if she does get voted in, they'd be flushing there own game down the toilet. people are making out shes getting voted in directly as a ccp employee and its not like ccp are never going to check there forums for ideas and only go with hers, personally i would hate to see her get in because her ideas are against everything i do so to see them all implemented would turn me away most likely with many others, plus we always have merc contracts"

5/15/2010,"so i am somewhat puzzled that a very random other candidate seems to have become in many folks eyes the only alternative carebears have to vote for. i want folks to realize there are several other ""carebear"" oriented folks that would serve you much better should you offer them your support.you especially should realize that the effectiveness of whoever wins is directly related to how well they can work with the other csm. the high profile candidate who shall not be named that seems to somehow be considered the primary ""carebear"" candidate most definitely will not play well with others should they tragically be elected to the next csm.issler dainzethe carebear no one talks about who plays well with others and is also running for the csm along with several other good carebear candidates and one not so good one"

' need to jump on the bandwagon and crucify her. seems opportunistic from a neutral perspectivei mean the same publication is running interviews with csm candidatesif said publication was so concerned about policing 'weak' csm candidates or whatever it would have done so on a regular basis towards other characters that don't perform. i am opposed to ank's views for the most part. i support pvp / suicide ganking and all other kind of 'bad' things that make eve the sandbox it is.but it doesn't change the fact she is expressing an opinion. this opinion might be shared by many in the 'carebears & co' crowdjust cause the pvp /0.0 crowd is more vocal on the forums should not be an excuse to go full swing characters assassination on ank from a newspaper even if anks views are out there isn't eve a sandbox that caters to various play styles and isn't csm a democratic processlet it run its course.ccp is not going to jeopardize the core tenants of its sandbox game. ccp is under no obligation to implementation ideas from this csm conduit. so unfettered and real damage don't come into the picture.csm is an ingenious way to get the playerbase vested and involved. its also partial pr exercise.but don't be under any illusion. ccp has its own priority qhindering or alternate views is it a group of people that are infallible and their way is the only way.even good ideas have unforeseen circumstancesif csm is about catering to one segment that is beyond reproach then i guess thats hindering. no. to put it in context while there are candidates who aren't great or who are even bad, none approaches the level of ank. which yet again, is why she's unsuitable for the csm and why even you admit that she's ""easy prey"". some csm members not contributing once elected. isn't that more fail ?those are ""touchy' subjects so lets go full swing and bash a easy prey"
5/15/2010,"so? your argument is essentially a claim that since it's news, we shouldn't comment on it. and of course the point wasn't that the rest of the candidates are perfect, but that ank is clearly unsuitable for a position on the csm, for reasons detailed at length. ""but it's only my opinion!"" is the dodge of those who can't back up their claims. so what if her views are her opinions? her opinions show she's not a suitable candidate for the csm. nor, should i add, are quoting her own words ""character assassination"". if the things she's said reflect so poorly on her, does that speak to the nature of her views, or the wrongness in pointing out her views? if she got her ideas implemented? she'd ruin the game. even if she can't, she'd take up a csm spot which could be filled by someone who can actually do some good and csm members will have to counteract her influence. like i just said and you just quoted. nobody, at all, has said we should eliminate or hobble pve. nobody is saying she's unsuitable for the csm because she's a bear, but because of her lack of knowledge about the game, venomous hatred for pvp'ers, etc... (in other words, you're saying someone should be entitled to her own opinion when that opinion is that nobody else should be entitled to their own opinions). and i'm not sure exactly what you think democracy means. it doesn't mean that candidates can run for positions without being challenged or that voters can't make mistakes. no. a csm member who is actively bad is worse than an empty chair. i would, in fact, vote for an empty chair before i'd vote for ank. again, if she's such ""easy prey"" that shows she's not a good candidate. people wouldn't have to be complaining about the fact that it's so easy to point out her flaws if she was a strong candidate. ""she's a weak candidate, so don't point out how weak a candidate she is"" is simply not persuasive."
5/15/2010,confirming that quotation is a form of character assassination.
5/15/2010,danes don't. i know a lot about cvs. listing ccp as a job for a csm is ... embellishing.

5/15/2010,ankh has heaps of experience in roleplaying a ccp employee.
5/15/2010,"it has come to my attention that certain malevolent forces are organising a series of griefing raids against one of our erstwhile csm applicants. this bitter and unworthy plan will no doubt explain her lack of presence on the servers during, before, and no doubt after the honest and democratic vote of csm has been lodged.while i have canvassed for another csm applicant  the ever effervescent mazzilliu, i would like to state, in the spirit of eve playing comradery, that i am 100% against any form of in game trolling or hindrance of any upright member of our glorious community.this dark and uncoordinated mob, no doubt mad with visions of rapine and slaughter  have infringed on that unnamed csm applicant's close group of friends, unearthing vital and private communications of a particular nature  you may have tasted from that bitter cup with some of the fabricated salacious rumours about her personal opinions. in short  she is personally breached, something i am loathe to share with you, most moral reader, and it is incumbent on us, as a collected community, to say no! to this very thing.i would urge you, in all seriousness, to add her to your contacts list. share with her, via in game communication, your heartfelt support, seek her out via in game means and, should it be necessary, shield her frail and feminine form with your ship, words and thoughts. i shall not name her, but she stands amongst us, a leviathan."

5/15/2010,up
5/16/2010,yes
5/16/2010,"^^ thisif a damage penetration mechanism works, it is almost actually equivalent to a damage boost, because they both achieve the same result: breaking through tanks.also, in the fleet fight situations most rails are used in, you are either destroyed outright by the alpha of a fleet or are rr'd up before being destroyed. either you have to nerf armour tanks by letting you penetrate straight through to structure, or you indirectly boost armour tanks, by letting shield tanks get penetrated. with all the complexities, and the fact that in a fleet fight you don't have time generally to admire the well made game mechanics, i think it's better just to go with a damage boost."
5/16/2010,"make rails load up only one bullet at a time, and have them able to swap out shells instantly. one problem solved. improve rail optimal by 10-12%. decrease range bonus on caldary ships to 7.5%, that of an apoc."
5/16/2010,omg. one bullet only? so i would have to reactivate guns every 10 sec or what?also nice try with placebo boost...try harder
5/16/2010,"you are either an idiot or a troll. of your own benefit, i honestly hope that it's a troll. if you switch ammo instantly, to switch ammot oyu need to reload your gun.. hm.. could that mean that you reload instantly?? no way.."
5/16/2010,"i fly an armor astarte with 2 damage mods, 7 t2 neutrons, and 74k ehp. not as much as i'd truly like on a command ship, but hardly papery."
5/16/2010,"i have already supported the thread as changes are in order, simply i was saying that making field command ships a super hac was not ccp idea.t3 cruisers command version has removed one of the possible (after changes) role, that of a ship faster/more agile, capable of working well with cruisers fleets.for sure all the field command ships need to be capable to use a warfare link without nerfing too much tank and dps. probably this summer ccp will do some rebalancing of weapons and ships, so maybe they will look command ships. as there is a lot of rebalancing it is only a small chance."
5/16/2010,"ok, again, this isnt just about pirates. one thing it is though is not about 0.0, its for people who want to live in lowsec, and not 0.0. so npc 0.0 is not in the equation here.the idea isnt that a corp/alliance 'run' or 'own' the lowsec system, it is about them being the acknowledged overlord of teh underworld there, or teh anti pirate/good guys in system.does a mob boss burn down the local businesses? no, he makes them pay him 'protection' money, this would be in the form of cheaper/better services, the same goes for the good guys in lowsec, tehy get cheaper/better servises out of gratitudeas for destabilisation, what an entity is actually doing is making a differnet stability, not breaking it.it isnt lowsec sov, its recognition of force.the main thing is to make it very different from both hisec and 0.0.not flaming your response, just clarifying the ideas..."
5/16/2010,"yes, good stuff, especially the shopping list less stockpiled materials."
5/16/2010,on behalf of our industrialists... please we beg of you
5/16/2010,while there my be need for additional refinements the core concept is sound. this is a good item for the csm to take up.
5/16/2010,bump!
5/16/2010,always for more usabitily. makes perfect sence. good idea.
5/16/2010,"agreed.alternatively, make the shadows non-stacking. which is to say, the shadow of one probe is not such a big deal and is somewhat useful for orientation. but when two or more shadows stack on each other, it gets darker and darker till it's difficult to see. if the shadow never got darker than a single one is now, there wouldn't be any problem."
5/16/2010,supported
5/16/2010,i fully endorse this
5/16/2010,excellent idea.
5/16/2010,no ones cares
5/16/2010,supported
5/16/2010,"instead of changing the way wardecs work, why not give industrialists a way to fight back that is more becoming of their chosen path? for example you could make all products, resources and products made by those resources which are put into the market by a wardecc'd corp and their alliance off limits to the opposing corp and their alliance(ie un-fittable, or fittable but you run the risk of concord attack despite your bribe). perhaps this could be obtainable by a similar bribe to concord. for a small corp, this would seem useless since your products represent a very small portion of the total market or may not affect a combat oriented corp at all. however, this would encourage small industrial corps to join large alliances so that it would more likely make an impact on the aggressors. furthermore, since this also affects the aggressor's alliance, the product ban might give the antagonizing corp some political considerations. worst case scenario? the aggressors and their alliance have other sources or are self sufficient and the ban does nothing. but at the very least it requires the wardeccing corp to think about, and prepare for, a few more factors before they wardec a small corp for no real reason but to get their jollies. also, it encourages these smaller corps to work together, and who knows? maybe they'll find out it's fun, consolidate some of those smaller corps, and end up with a larger, richer, and better prepared corp at the end."
5/16/2010,"so if a corp produces veldspar, then their attackers cant use ships and modules?seriously, this is the worst idea i've ever seen, and given that emo tj posts on this forum, that's quite an acheivement."
5/16/2010,"the root issue, imho, lies with ccp's over-romantacised notion of pvp. yes, these know it's harsh, but at the same time shroud themselves in the illusion that it's all about bonding, glorious battles, good learning experiences, etc. the reality, of course, is that any thread of honor (ccp: stop censoring a perfectly legit word like modicum kinda makes you look illiterate) is far to be found in eve. i have yet to see a mechanism that isn't being abused by pirates and griefers. naturally, they don't see it as 'abusing.' to them, whatever they can get away with is a valid game mechanic. wardeccing is one of those areas where ccp must have envisioned fun ways to do pvp in high-sec. yet, here too, for the most part it's just low lives preying on noob corps. funny that is: although honor is a rare commodity, if it were ever put on the market, it would still be dirt-cheap, as nobody seems to wants it.the problem, of course, is that you cannot simply outlaw wardecs in high-sec; nor can you make them so it's a mutual thing. frankly, the latter is really one of the most stupid suggestions i've ever come across here.mr. h: ""can we declare war on you guys?""churchill: ""um, ... no!"" :)lol. seriously, in pointing out genuine issues, people tend to get too carebear overboard in their proposals to deal with them. whilst i'm a carebear too, let's keep it real, okay?"
5/16/2010,i was think about righting up a detailed description of what is wrong with your statement about mutual war decs. but i do not want to feed the troll. go back to playing wow tbh
5/16/2010,funky gotta say good idea but you should really start up a purposal with it rather then adding it to the discussion on this one being that it sounds more like an embargo or trade ban idea. you can't however stop someone from fitting something they already purchased however you can force them to stop purchasing items produced by your corp or alliance however its a double edged sword. by proventing them from purchasing items from your corp or alliance you provent your corp for possibly making isk. you could say this was the industrial side of the war-dec. once a griefer corp or alliance builds up a rep enough industrial corps will have trade bans on them that they won't be able to purchase they're ships and modules lol sounds a little more effective then hiding in a station or paying for a merc to come in and help lol. though other corps could band together and put the same thing towards an industrial corp in so doing causing that industrial corp to fold being that they can't sell they're product like i said double edged sword. send me a private message in game would like to talk to you about this and possibly have you post it on here for csm consideration.
5/16/2010,bump!
5/16/2010,bump!!!
5/16/2010,i am proposing something similar in my csm campaign. supported!
5/16/2010,if ccp thinks it should remain as a pos module ... they could increase the cpu/pg usage high enough that you cant really arm the tower.
5/16/2010,supported.
5/16/2010,i find it hilarious the only reason given by the op that the kill mails shouldn't exist is because of killboard efficiency ratio.worried about your e-peen much ? looks that way with a corp name like sons of viagra.
5/16/2010,"nullsec pubbies whining about their killboard being devauled. oh the lolz.is your ego suffering a little too much that 'carebears' get to have some fun?also. you do realize the reason they are fail fitted is to prevent outcry's of ""favoritism"" for people getting that phat loot being dropped otherwise. right?"
5/16/2010,"it's possible to make cheap fits that are non-fail. using the same fitting rules they followed(t2 rigs, t2 gear), i can make a nightmare that deals 1129 dps pulse/1024 dps beam, has 164k ehp pulse/170k beam(beam needs a pdu to fit), and runs a mwd, a cap booster, and a shield rr that gives 314 tank to another nightmare. the cap lasts a decent length of time, and as long as the ships stay in a ball, their tank and dps would both be pretty fearsome - drop a couple dozen of those onto the field and watch the rpers boil. the nightmare is a ridiculously good ship, even without faction gear, as long as you fit it right."
5/16/2010,"not gonna lie, when i first started playing eve i was convinced that ramming did damage - mostly because someone rammed me and shot me at the same time and i was too dumb to check logs. i do like this idea, it's adds some tactical flair to the game where far too often people hit keep at range or orbit. and it's just cool. my only concern, apart from having like 40 people bump the same dude and instapop his ass (which can be eliminated rather trivially), are the hardware implications of it. with ships bumping against one another constantly, just randomly, the server may get stressed making the ""are these bumps valid"" computations. but if it turns out these computations are negligible, or can be implemented in such a way that crazy lag isn't created, then i'm all for it and it sounds pretty baller."
5/16/2010,"if i'm understanding you correctly, you're implying this will be used for suicide ganking, in which case i suggest you actually read the thread as i've addressed the hi-sec issue."
5/16/2010,"actually i did read it. you imply that what you proposed eliminates the possibility of an exploit, which is not the case. no matter, i actually like the idea of ramming, but i like it as a crazy last resort ""kamikaze"" style attack, which it can never become in eve for obvious reasons."
5/16/2010,well an exploit is possible with any game mechanic that is not thoroughly tested before being implemented on tq. you could argue that no new mechanics should ever be added in that case
5/16/2010,"too much computation, not enough useful game effect. i like combat mechanics as they are. not supported."
5/16/2010,"how are you defining useful gameplay? as far as i'm concerned, anything that the majority of players will have fun with is useful. with regards to computation, i disagree. there is already code running to determine if bumps occur - and lets face it they are reasonably rare. an additional check would be added here to see if the speed of the ships is over the threshold and, if they're in empire, whether they are ""legally"" able to collide. it is very unlikely that this will be the case, and so the real bulk of the calculations will rarely take place, making the additional strain on the server will be a lot lower than it seems at first glance."
5/16/2010,"you'd have to be careful how you did it, because eve is overflowing with hotkeys already. but in principle, i like it. would be a nice addition to the game."
5/16/2010,"i think this falls under the category of feature creep.yes, if done properly this feature could be cool. but lets be fair, it doesn't help much.eve online is as much about the metagame play as it is being a sandbox. what options do we have today; eve voice, ventrilo, mumbel (hierachies for command structure and communications) and broadcast menu. i want to hear the fear or joy in an fcs voice when commanding, no recorded messages will be able to do that. being an fc and/or leader is competely metagame play, u don't need features like this to make a good fc. i also think that this feature would result in clutter, too many options, a lot of confusion, also remember that these msg would have to get translated in a couple of languages.its a good thought, but i don't see it working, and i personally wouldn't want it"
5/16/2010,you want to add a sound based feature into a game (in)famous for poorly implemented sound...good luck with that.
5/16/2010,i like :)
5/16/2010,"this might be a bit overpowered. you would just give a 0.01 isk bounty on wartargets and then you would instantly know where they are. there are allready locator agents that let u find who every you want. just takes a bit more time. hunting is a sport, i personally don't want this feature as it would reduce my satisfaction of finding and killing people"
5/16/2010,i think the down time should be changed once a month.as it is now some people get to be on right when the server comes back up and get first chance at all the newly spawned stuff.i think this is unfair to those of us not able to be on at this time.if it rotated once a month then all eventually would get a chance to be on right after the new stuff spawns.
5/16/2010,1. downtime should be in the working hours of ccp. which happens to be euro timezone and making the the dt at early noon gives them the time to fix problems without having to do night shifts.2. i cant really understand all the whine about respawning ... just last night i got pretty nice drops from plexes in highly crowded space. and that was well into us tz.not supported.
5/16/2010,don't forget the dt is during non-peek time for most users
5/16/2010,also downtime is when item ids are freed up from items that have been destroyed or trashed so they can be reused. this is maybe the most important function aside from general server cleanup.
5/16/2010,fine i will just move to france
5/16/2010,...but then you'll be at work/school when dt hits and you'll start whining again...
5/16/2010,"why dont you ask some australians about how great it is having dt right in the middle of your prime time, i'm sure they'll be more than happy to tell you their feelings about it."
5/16/2010,"all of us know how powerful supercarriers and titans are and time it takes to destroy onee.g. supercarrier with resist all at 90% and is under attack by 100 dreads + support... this would be around 400k (4k dps for each dread)/ 90 = 40 000 dps + 20k random dps = 60k dps total. so you will only need ensure u have 18 carriers in triage w/ 3*rr (reps 65k damage per second) repping supercarrier till 14min logoffsky timer goes off.therefore i propose creation of a medical pos for supercaps only. supercaps could not be repped on battle and only way to repair them would be throw this medical pos. it could repair up to 3 supercaps, 1% armor/hull each hour, and this structure once online, it cant be turned off, only destroyed. this would be only available for sov level 1 and can only put 1 med. pos per const. for example.supercaps once inside medical pos, cant warp out until they have all armor /hull 100% repped. so supercap pilots would think twice before going to battle or something else.hope u guys liked my idea."
5/16/2010,either you have enough remote repair support on the field or your super capital dies.as some kind of special pos would favor sov holders over attackers...not supported
5/16/2010,supported :)
5/16/2010,then noone would take their super caps out....thats kinda against what ccp is trying to do with super caps to begin with.they are trying to make them useful on the field and they want them used.if you cant kill the super cap kill something else.
5/16/2010,"do you know there's jumpbridges, cyno jammer/gene.... u telling me that favors attackers, not holders?"
5/16/2010,"if you have 60k dps on the field, you can pop a triage carrier roughly every 30 seconds. so those 18 triage carriers turn into popcorn in the first 9 minutes, and then you spend the other 6 minutes doing 20 million damage to the mom. if it's logged off, then its hardeners aren't running and skills aren't applied to its hp, so that should be enough to blow it up pretty easily. i don't see a problem here."
5/16/2010,"well if the mothership pilot just logs the active modules keep running. only if he tries to relog and logs of then, the modules turn off. bonuses might be gone after the first log off though."
5/16/2010,i was assuming that you neut him dry in those first 9 minutes.
5/16/2010,i would just like to be able to email the book marks.
5/16/2010,"no to your idea,but ""loans"" are hard to make player to player, because either you need full collateral (which sucks)or you take a huge risk.if there was a way to force a player into bankruptcy it be nice. and make it when someone takes a loan you can't biomass your char.problem is its hard to have loans like real life because in real life thing go badly if you cannot pay."
5/16/2010,"i am sure it was most likely mentioned before, but i can't find it.the same code that puts fighters back in the drone bay after the client crashes needs to be for all drones.having to re-stock up on drones is a pain in the ass. not to mention that if you use 'augmented' drones your out a few hundred million."
5/16/2010,"posting again to give a thumbs up because like half of this game, they did not think ahead enough to implement a thumbs up when making the op, or adding a thumbs down."
5/16/2010,just a thought ... the normal drones cant warp unlike fighters.
5/16/2010,"honestly, who gives a **** if they can warp or not?so it sounds logical in a spaceship game that they made it back to the drone bay?"
5/16/2010,"i much prefer the ""reconnect to drones"" solution to this particular problem. avoids the entire log-offski scenario and doesn't break immersion contrary to the auto-magical return-to-bay option."
5/16/2010,reconnect to drones makes sense. having the drones try to make it back into your bay makes sense. but it shouldn't be automatic - they can't warp to you like fighters can.
5/16/2010,"lolrpreasons is just arguing semantics.if you are going to put forward a real reason against, then please do so.(and all ships are not immediately in emergency warp upon connection break)"
5/16/2010,"i didn't intend that as lolrp, i intended that as a game mechanic reason. assuming i'm not scrammed, i can warp off the field, but i'll lose my non-fighter drones without possibility of recall. the proposal is to make logging off do something that can't be done while you're logged in. i dislike the idea of logging being a proper tactic for anything besides ""i don't want to be here any more"". giving it functionality that doesn't exist any other way is bad."
5/16/2010,"i am not sure if this has come up allready.reserved texture id slots on the ship models, 1 for corp and 1 for alliance. which are automatically pulled from your character information and auto-updated with your current employment.(i am a 3d artist and currently employed for a game developer-i've extracted all eve models and seen how they are made. its not hard to impliment)all the logos are allready in the database, technically this would just result in 1-2 extra draw calls, which should be very manageble."

5/16/2010,"don't change missions like that, a non linear mission would mean more mission runners, and we don't need more yarr-tards complaining that mission running makes over 9000 trillion isk per hour.tech advances didnt make sense to me, currently you invent. sometimes it fails, changing this will screw up prices a bit too much but may be able to be balanced out to fix this.mining needs a buff like thatfw, never did it but wouldnt factions be warfarring, not just playersmore eve story cant hurt"

5/17/2010,"there are areas of eve game-play where the volume of clicks has been used as the limiting factor for how much return a user gets.these ""click-sinks"" are not always needed and often similar results can be achieved without the use of this game-play crutch.this proposal is for ccp to...1) make a list of click-sinks that exist in the game.2) discuss and analyse these areas of game-play with a focus on their contribution to game-play.3) create user-stories for removing unneeded click-sinks.examples might include invention or bpo locking, where the clicks provide no game-play element apart from pain.obviously pi is a major new click-sink with game-play being tied directly to how often you click.this creates a situation where to be ""good"" at pi you have to click more then others.click-centric play like this is not good for users, it creates injuries and adds nothing to the game."

5/17/2010,you can get interaction by just setting up a mutual chat channel. and you seem to be saying that the war-deccer is in it for a good fight. an abundance of station humping plated battleships and neutral guardians seem to disagree with you.
5/17/2010,"wait, you are sitting in a nice, safe station and complaining because there are bad guys outside who want to kill you off and on for a week? you realize the undock button is an option right? you don't have to press it. additionally, this is a reoccurring theme throughout eve, no matter how big and bad you, your corp, your alliance, or your coalition gets.here's the deal. these ""little corp gets dec'd by small pvp corp"" things are part of learning the game (that learning cliff is because this game is different than what you are used to playing). you have to live through war decs a few times to lose the ""i am a god among ants"" attitude drilled into people in single player games (and in many of the other pve-centric mmo games). eve is about connections and cooperation. connections take time to develop, but there is a satisfaction that comes from them far greater than mining an asteroid. cooperation can be achieved almost instantly in the game. don't cry about the lesson being unfair, learn from the lesson and you will grow."

5/17/2010,"if you were to design a bait ship with the constraints of:faction battleshiponly t2 fittingshow would you fit it?i mean, that's basically what that ship was. it lasted long enough to pull a bunch of people together in high sec who ended up shooting each other (based on the battle report). a faction battleship designed to kill people with the ability to do that sans concord would be... horrible. i can't imagine the threadnought steaming from ""the devs killed my drake"" ""they killed my raven too!""the problem with many of these live events is the inability to pull together pvpers in a timely way without melting dozens of pveers first.sure, these things are supposed to be terrifying, but imagine the terror a player could wreck with a faction bs that was immune to concord."
5/17/2010,"assuming the servers could handle it(which they probably could if you pick a system that isn't naturally too busy and reinforce the node), they should make an event with a decently fit group of enemies, and give out an hour or two worth of notice to people. let them actually form up properly, and then throw a ball of lasery death at people. if they actually built a proper npc ai into the mix, it'd be really awesome. imagine a proper sansha fleet - headed up with a leviathan, maybe a wyvern or two, a few triage chimeras and dps revelations, couple dozen nightmares, some phantasms, basilisks, onyxes, rooks, curses, and the like in support. maybe 100 ships in all, with human pilots on the important ones and competent ai in the rest. small enough that the players could win, but big enough that they'd know they were in a fight. now that would be a live event worth having."
5/17/2010,"[proposal] prevent planetary interaction > fail.we need to stop ccp from turning the new planetary interaction into an new epic fail.there should be a claimable grid on the planet, but on the test server its not there.i was in the understanding that when i build on a planet no one can build near my sites. in order for others to get my sites and resources they should engage war (thats where dust comes in).at the moment you can build right on top of other pilots planetary interaction construction sites. but there should be a perimeter around your pi stuff so you claim that part of the planet, building on top of others means no competition over planet resources, no competition means no wars in dust)if this problem is not fixed then pi = failedit:if ccp decides to fix this after the launch of the upcoming patch then they have to nuke all the planets to get a reset. in other words destroy stuff from eve pilots resulting in a time / isk loss on there side."
5/17/2010,you want to prevent planetary interaction to be greater than fail? so you want pi = fail or pi < fail instead? that's an interesting position to take.
5/17/2010,"the data that has been released about dust does not indicate anything remotely resembling what you seem to think it is.dust is to be woven into the sovereignty system, any impact on pi will be collateral damage (like mopping up moon towers) so none of your 'sky is falling"" arguments has any meaning.what you should be concerned about is the absolutely insane difference in earning potential between null-sec and everywhere else .. according the last numbers i saw pi will barely make a profit outside of 0.0.ccp made a big fuzz about limiting the passive income of null with moon changes and now they are giving them a whopper, only difference is that they will be free from having to fight over empire turf for that income but can print their isk safely in their back-yards."
5/17/2010,"hurray! i want to print isk. you don't understand 0.0. you think individuals are making large amounts of passive income. passive income in 0.0 requires a lot of cooperation (read an entire alliance), to the point that per capita income is fairly low from passive income sources compared to, say, r&d agents. also, the passive income in 0.0 is constantly flushed into the war machines required to protect it, so i would question whether or not these passive income sources amount to net positive income."
5/17/2010,"wait what? poses are absurdly profitable. yes, it requires some cooperation small, but it damn sure doesn't take ""an entire alliance working together"". way to try and defend your current isk printing machine and demand more. i'm not even sure why 0.0 should have such high value planets considering that most of 0.0 is more safe than most of low sec. -liang"

5/17/2010,"tbh, it seems to me that ccp just did not want to invest the resources to redesign the ui when it was originally implemented.the crappy and the good subsystems require the same parts to build, just different prints.the price for the good ones is higher not because of supply/demand, but because they have to make up for the crappy ones. so essentially the buyers of good subsystems subsidize the bad ones."

5/17/2010,"long story short. basically people are using the momentum of supercaps (or whatever ships that will work) to 'bump' enemy ships outside of pos bubbles. here is an article in which pos bowling was recently used to kill a titan linkageand no, this is not some whine thread about getting f-ed by pos bowling (just to head that off)the issue here is that people are exploiting the existing flaws in space astronautics of the eve game to do things that make absolutely zero sense. a shield is suppose to deflect massive amounts of firepower, yet, a super cap can be slung into it to bounce ships inside out (the super cap is then forced out by the shield) almost like it was made of rubber instead of energy. there is also the second issue of tiny interceptors bouncing ships the size of titans like a ping pong ball. no sense whatsoever. the mass of a titan is so great a tiny interceptor should be flattened by it. but the reason a titan is bounced is not because of mass issues, but because of the silly borked coding of 'autoavoidance computers' that keep and two ships from touching in the game.suggestions:-require pos password to be entered if warping to a bm inside a pos shield or a bm that intersects with a pos shield in transit.-recode pos shields so that nothing, not even ships with huge momentum, can push into a pos shield. when i hit a wall i certainly stop pretty dead cold.-introduce an anchor ship option for supercapitals so that supercaps cannot be moved unless unanchored.-create a new ship collision avoidance code that takes into consideration two ship's mass when a 'bump' occurs (ships with high mass would not be moved at all)"
5/17/2010,the mechanic has only become a bannable offence nothing more but what it doesn't do is solve the problem. the titan from the news post was bumped out by warping through the pos which is apparently still possible because it happened with the atlas titan and i've seen people warping through a friendly pos with dreadnoughts as well.1. yes absolutely2. agreed3. i'd rather like to see that titans are locked in place just like dreads in siege when the jump portal is activated rather than an overall anchor.4. absolutely although changes have been made to less then impact supercapitals should not be so easily impacted by ships many times smaller.support.
5/17/2010,"i propose that concord starts selling monthly 'protection' plans. i know this concept was offered earlier, in jest, but i could really see it happen. :) here's the outline.1) basic package: free. you get what they offer now.2) rapid response plan: 100 mil per month, per sec level. ups response time to that of a higher security level, to a max of protection equivalent of that which you get in 1.0 space. not applicable in < 0.5 space. so, if you're in 0.5 space and want the 0.9 deal, you'll pay 400mil a month. flying in 0.6 space gets you 1.0 type protection for that money. and should you happen to fly in 0.8 space, you'll still only get 1.0 protection.3) anti-gank plan: 500 mil a month. same response time and protection level as that of basic package, but additionally you'll get a beacon you can carry around in your cargohold, which makes scanning your ship and content impossible.* the beacon is programmed by concord to work for the time you paid; and it's personalized, so it's of no use to anyone else but you. loss of the beacon will be restituted by concord. not paying your monthly fee just means it will stop working (remotely deactivated by concord).* not including protection from combat scanner probes.4) all packages are personal, non-transferrable, and non-refundable.and now cometh the beauty. people willing to sign a 'high-sec non-aggression pact' (barring legal wars) will share in the vast amount of isk concord makes this way! at 500 mil per participant player, per month, this could add up. there's no penalty for not signing, but if you do, you could receive a fair amount of free isk each month. people who have anything but the basic package can themselves not participate in the high-sec non-aggression programme.yes, essentially this is a protection scheme like the mob runs: you pay not to be harassed. but i feel it's a good compromize: it's not just asking pirates to be nice, but makes you pay a hefty sum if you want it. and pirates get something in return."

5/17/2010,i think you *totally missed* the point of the original proposal - which was to limit how effective concord was. not supported at all.-liang
5/17/2010,"first off, i will not use my signature caps lock and bold so some people don't get all butt hurt about it. at first i was not going to do a mission balance proposal but my followers have had many request for it. so here it is:currently in order for a pilot to be able to successfully be able to run a level 4 mission they have to fit specifically for it and being able to tank the mission and any pirates that butt in is simply impossible. so the following will happen to help balance these losers not minding their own business.- every single mission, plex and dead space will have a gate at the beginning that everyone has to take.- if the mission belongs to the player wanting to activate the gate, they simply just need to hit the warp button when selecting the gate and they will be warped off to the mission.- if anyone else that is not in the mission owners gang they first have to use a hacking module to break the code.- chance of success is also affected by that players standings towards the agent who gave the other player the mission. the higher the standings, the better chance to break the code on the gate.- once the code is hacked, the player will be able to take the gate.- when the intruding player lands on the grid all rats will reset aggro and choose new targets at random to even the odds.- now because historically pirates have always waited till they outnumbered the target by 5:1 odds the mission owners rep amount will then be increased by 600% like a siege module does for a dread.- if the gate leads to a dead space or plex, the first person who has discovered the gate does not need a code to activate the gate. all others muse hack the gate unless they are in a gang with someone who is already past the gate.- if someone who is not in your corp/alliance/gang/blue to you is in your mission and steals, all rats reset aggro and choose new targets to help balance this new threat.- if someone steals from you in your mission and you agress them, depending on standings with the agent who supplied the mission, a squad of npc's that are from that agent will warp in to assist you. the make up of this squad is dependent on the difficulty of the mission. the harder the mission, the better the back up squad will be.that is all for now. i will trust that any non-related comments on this proposal will be handled appropriately so i will have no need to lock this thread if anyone tries to derail it. remember the rules, all comments have to be constructive and not trolls. i will also be starting a mailing list for my followers to keep up with the latest balancing issues i will be working on."
5/17/2010,my costructive comments involve taking a neutron blaster to your ship any time i see you in local.are things so bad in the north that you have nothing better to do than post crap-threads on an alt?
5/17/2010,"thank you for stopping to use caps, it makes it more readable.that said, i do not think the idea is well balanced. i for instance would see problems in inducing the heightened rep amount by taking a few alts there."
5/17/2010,"hacking entry idea: decent. but each individual not in the mission pilot's gang will have to perform this action, regardless of their gang.re-assessing aggro mechanics: needs work. the idea of new arrivals possibly gaining aggro from existing non-aggressed npcs, sleeper-like, has some bit of merit. this will have a deleterious effect on logistics, however, due to weighted aggro mechanics already in the mechanics.aggro mechanics: nothing different than anywhere else."
5/17/2010,tl;dr
5/17/2010,"nice plan.because the nc historically spam titans into subcap fights (proof), i propose that all sc ships have 99% resists vs titan weapons to make the fights more fair. constructive comments only, please!tl;dr: 0/10 why hasn't this obvious troll been banned yet?"
5/17/2010,*mumbles something about badgers and dramiels*
5/17/2010,i did a mission once in a badger but a dramiel pilot came in to it so i killed him.
5/17/2010,"this can be said in one sentence:""please protect agent-runners from pirates & ninja salvagers""not supported.one should use brains to avoid unwanted encounters instead of asking for mega advantage like there is only one thing which can be used - npc aggro. it will be logical if they cycle through targets same way slippers do."
5/17/2010,"why not just ask for the ""i win"" button outright instead of spamming completely moronic ""save me from da piwates"" requests. would save time eh?"
5/17/2010,"/supported, once again an excellent suggestion.i would love to see more of your threads tbh and will be joining the mailing list asap, shame you arent applying for csm :("
5/17/2010,removed trolling comments. everyone is entitled to their own opinion in this forum. this is a place where all players can get the csms attention regarding issues. if you do not agree with something please be constructive.
5/17/2010,"simply put there is no reason why one should have to be in a ship to rename it, especially since in station there is a ""rename ship"" item on the right-click menu each ship--even though it only works for the one you're actually in. if for some bizarre reason this is not feasible, then remove or grey out the ""rename ship"" item from all the right-click menus except the one for the ship currently piloted."
5/17/2010,agreed.
5/17/2010,supported.
5/17/2010,awesome idea
5/17/2010,"so no **** there i was in a fleet warp, as we were coming out of warp i smacked in to a corp mate sending him flying 50km. would this idea kill me because i was part of a fleet warp?a group of capitals cyno in some where and play ping pong.someone warps to their pos, their warp lands them on the pos what happens next?"
5/17/2010,"congratulations on not reading the thread. i understand its a good 2 minutes work, but maybe just don't bother commenting if you haven't read it?i already clearly stated that one party in the collision should be moving at at least 50% of its maximum speed and have its mwd active, precisely to stop these kind of situations being a problem."
5/17/2010,this
5/17/2010,"i dont much like the idea of ramming for damage in combat purey because to be fair if a ship rammed another ship that woudl realistically be suiciding your ship, or steamroling the other ship depending on ship sizes...i do however hate the bumping mechanic due to it being a ridiculous tactic which really does ruin immersion due to its ludicrous nature."
5/17/2010,"ramming speed... to get to the gate in the middle of a gate camp. worse, ramming speed at the interceptor flying at me from the gate camp (which is usually directly in line with the gate so if i miss i just jump the gate)."
5/17/2010,"in pi, its designed so that i may setup all of my installations, find out the limitations such as cpu and powergrid, then click a ""setup"" button once i am sure that this is how i want it setup up. then all my instructors are put into place automatically. a similar system should be put into pos setup. this way i can setup all of my modules, tell them which one i want anchored and where. once they are setup i click the ""setup"" button and the instructions are carried out, possible in a queue one at a time like its done today, but this way i can take the 30 mins to set everything up then leave while the pos puts itself together, but i'm not required to stay at the pos all day to complete the task of placing, anchoring, and onlining my modules."
5/17/2010,"a pos onlining queue has been requested before. it's a good idea, but ccp has already heard the request, so there's no real point asking for it again."
5/17/2010,"the delay is deliberately meant to slow down the process of setting up a pos. if this queuing idea was allowed, resistars would be much easier (and safer) to setup. this limits the ability of system defenders to attack the pos before it becomes this hideous monstrosity that requires a large fleet to kill.obviously, this is less of an issue post-dominion, but remains a valid reason to not allow caps/orcas to dump an entire high-resist pos on the field in enemy space, then cloak up, fly to the edge of the grid, or safe up, to safely wait for the pos to finish the queue."
5/17/2010,"yea, you should probably fight in a real fleet fight before suggesting something like this, and by fight, i mean you should try being the fleet commander on one side of said fight.theres just so many things wrong with the idea, that it would look like a dissertation trying to get them all into a single post."
5/17/2010,"a real fleet commander in a real fight has voice comms set up, and wouldn't use this. but i regard this as being the same sort of idea as eve voice - it may be inferior, but it's easy, and it'll see use by smaller groups who don't have the means to put everyone on teamspeak. not all features are aimed at the high-end players."
5/17/2010,"you're obviously the authority on the ""real"" means of communication and no other means should be allowed because you said so. real commanders would never use this (you speak on behalf of all of them), and since eve only consists of real commanders this proposal is ""wrong"". very logical, thanks!"
5/17/2010,"i see now that your going to be bitter towards anybody who does not agree with your idea.stellar way to start it off yo. this is but one of the things inherently wrong with the idea. there are reasons that alliances use other means of communication, the least of which, is the inability to communicate with the fleet, and get updates, during one of eve's frequent crashes during fleet fights. ok, ignoring how stupid you are for coming off all ""baaaw you don't like my idea""allow me to break it down for you slim:a fc has about 2 million things going on while driving the fleet. he's usually dual accounting, at least, or he's got whispers set up to 3 or 4 channels that have scouts, logistics, dictors, ect.he's receiving about 9 metric tons of information, looking at maps if he doesn't know the area by heart, and he's giving a lot of orders to those different people, and this is all outside of a fight.sometimes, your opponents are dying fast enough to make verbally calling targets a pain, much less using some click and key combo to work them out, all while running probes, getting warp ins, moving scouts, ect.in short, its too much, and i'm sorry that me not liking your idea has you all butthurt, but this is a dumb idea, that would get used by like, 1/20th of the eve population, for a week, before they went back to the old faster way of just basic voice communication. its a waste of programing time."
5/17/2010,"then you're completely missing my point. i agree, no 0.0 fleet with half a brain would use this feature. but there do exist groups of players that aren't 0.0 fleets. a gang of newbie missioners could easily find this feature to be exactly what the doctor ordered, for example. doubly so for people who don't have microphones set up and working, which is actually a pretty significant portion of the eve community. pandemic legion is organized and elite, and i doubt you tolerate people being micless, but matt's missioning and mining doesn't work the same way. this feature isn't useless, it's just aimed at people who aren't you."
5/17/2010,"i agree with everything you said, except this."
5/17/2010,"disagreeing or stating ones opinion is one thing. making presumably factual statements that no fc would ever use this and therefore it's wrong is something else. this was the point of my reply.you may be right that a fc of a large fleet may not want to use this. i wouldn't know. my goal here is to offer an alternative to the other 99% of the eve's players who don't command large fleets. those that may only have a couple hours for a small-scale pvp. those that don't want to waste hours on just setup and preparation. those that may have language barriers that prevent them from fully enjoying the game. etc, etc..."
5/17/2010,"by comparison to other groups, i mean."
5/17/2010,"i would like to suggest the following, considering the current state of eve's little annoyances. that the entire major improvments be broken into two types at different times.summer revamping: limit the summer content expansion to adding things like graphics for existing in-game materials, re-examining existing in-game mechanics and the like (mission changes, ship modifications such as af and destroyers, ammunition updates for things like rockets, ect.) no new content, per se, beyond updated existing in game items, issues, and the like.winter expansion: adding new content; a holiday gift to the loyal players who have become so addicted to the marvel that is eve. this will give build teams an entire year on specifically new content while other teams are given a similar year to tackle existing content issues."
5/17/2010,"while the principle of fixing old broken stuff first is one i agree with, i don't think it lends itself to the neat categorization you're trying to impose. for example, what were the dominion sovereignty changes? they were new content in many ways, but they were also intended as a fix to the old sov mechanics. summer or winter? also, i bet you'll hate this change as soon as you realize that you only get fixes once a year and your preferred fix isn't in the fix patch for the year. sorry mate, but this is too simplistic to work."
5/17/2010,"there shouldn't be too many mechanic fixes in the same patch because they might not mash together well, but there's a lot of buggy, unfinished, and low-quality content that needs to be fixed before more features creep onto us with tyrannis. at the very least, ccp could fix a few basic mechanics at the same time, like the eris and the dramiel, without throwing the balancing off too much.i don't support exactly what you propose since you seem to be asking for an emphasis on mechanic fixes instead of emphasizing content fixes, but in general this is the right proposal.this may not need to be done every summer, but it definitely needs to be done this summer."
5/17/2010,"i was just looking at my old old classic content screenshots/fraps today. i was so sad. typhoon has been de-rusted almost completely. engine trails gone. cyno effects ruined. sensor booster bubbles gone, in favor of an effect that makes my eyes bleed. shield booster/hardener bubbles gone. the per polygon cloak effect was badass too..i'd go on about sound, because even though it's always been buggy, at least the sounds were good, and you could hear them from more than 5m away. now i'm with the eve has sound? crew though."
5/17/2010,"he said top 100.something like the rouges gallery would be nice though, some of the top bounties in game don't really even play anymore, something that kept a running track on bounties, like, 24 hours old.today, you can see where each person in eve with a bounty logged off at yesterday, when was the last noted movement by the suspect, ect, ect.simple tracking programs would actually do a lot to make an actual bounty hunting career in eve viable."
5/17/2010,"i'm not opposed, per se, but i do have a question - why do you think this feature is needed, given that we already have locator agents and buddy lists?"
5/17/2010,"you know a lot of bounty hunters?better yet, do you know any one person in eve, or have you heard of one person in eve, who is a bounty hunter?there are some seriously steep bounties out there, it should be more than a lucrative profession, there should be a few old rich bounty hunters at this point, only, there aren't any.eve is too large, and location agents suck, they are usually well away from the area your target is in, and by the time you get there, the target has moved. the process of finding someone in eve is nigh on impossible, even with the use of multiple agents on alts and a near ""sherlock holmes"" approach to finding people, you'll never actually end up near them, unless they are station bound alts.either remove bounties (they are pretty stupid and useless in their current incarnation) or finally, 7 years after release, give bounty hunters the tools they need to be a proper mini profession."
5/17/2010,i'd love to be a bounty hunter hunter.
5/17/2010,please post more threads on this topic.thanks.
5/17/2010,didn't all the mom pilots park their ships and quit eve until they're fixed?

5/17/2010,"perhaps we are being far too harsh and pedantic. can ankh simply say that it would have been better to have added the word ""volunteer"" to her ccp entry in her resume?i mean, if she were to admit that, it would defuse the situation. we could move on to other topics of discussion."
5/17/2010,the trolls would find something else to nit pick about i'm sure.
5/17/2010,"with a candidate as bad as ankh, the only thing you need to do to troll her is to quote her."
5/17/2010,"no no, you have it backwards. ank is such an awesome candidate that to quote her own words, at least if they don't paint a flattering picture of her, is slanderous and a blatant act of trolling. the fact that ank's own words make her look bad just shows how horrible you are."
5/17/2010,"[tinfoil]she's trying to get the votes of all those people that want to see the csm to fail, it's reverse psychology![/tinfoil]"
5/17/2010,sounds great.

5/17/2010,removed trolling comments - adida
5/17/2010,"it's getting harder to figure out when you folks are trolling, and when you just fail to understand what's going on. do you really not realize that he refuted your nonsense by pointing out that nobody was ""trolling"" ank, and alleging that posting her own words is ""trolling"" is an absurdity? or are you trolling about your refuted allegation of troling?because that's meta, baby. same question, are you unaware and lacking knowledge or trolling? do you not understand how funny it is to see you using words whose definition you obviously don't know while you talk about how following ccp's intended game mechanics and possibly scoring some neat loot in the process is ""cowardly"" and wrong, and other people need to figure out how the game works?or are you trolling? same question, is this meta-trolling? do you really, honestly not understand why ank's own words aren't slanderous accusations about her, or are you trolling? i'd ask if you really don't understand that papers write editorials, literally, all the time and that posting facts doesn't make one lose credibility, but you and i both know that you're just trolling on that point, so why waste the time discussing it, eh?"
5/17/2010,you know a forum is going downhill when people start making posts like this to preach about professional standards and dignity.
5/17/2010,fixed that for you
5/17/2010,"nah, that's not her style. she has vices, but forum vulgarity isn't among them."
5/17/2010,i'm sure it's all very hard to understand. you need to be an einstein to understand why nit picking about this resume thingy is trolling.
5/17/2010,"ah, so you were trolling. of course, believing that something is important even if someone else sees it as minor is not, in fact, 'trolling'. pretending that a difference of opinion on the importance of something is an attack? that is trolling. likewise, you were responding to a statement about ank's own quotes. obviously, all of her forum posts and all of her chat logs are her own words and all of them were dismissed by you as ""trolling"" since you don't like their content. pretending that quoting someone's own words is ""trolling"" is dishonesty designed to **** people off. in other words, you were trolling in order to claim that people were trolling. like i said, meta baby."
5/17/2010,"no, the nit picking about the resume is just that: nit picking. going on and on about it just to make someone look bad is trolling. anyone making a point about that clearly has his or her priorities wrong or is just plain trolling. pick whatever suits you best"
5/17/2010,"the reason people nitpick is because, once one person nitpicks, the other side pounces an easy argument to counter and blows it up. also, because ankhe and co. ignore ankhe's statements. they refuse to reply, confirm, deny, etc... they just ignore the statements and continue calling out individual weak arguments. i'm sure ankh and her supporters will, again, ignore this, but.."
5/17/2010,thank you for pointing out how stupid it is to squable about resumes when you have much better smear material.
5/17/2010,"you're a tool. i'm pointing out that it's you (and like minded individuals) keeping that argument going. some ankh detracters post a ******ed argument and you're milking it as hard as you can to avoid having to answer to the real things that make your candidate worthless. then again, that's her entire campaign platform. ""say bull****, ignore it when it comes back to haunt me, scare carebears""."
5/17/2010,wear tin foil hats much?
5/17/2010,"don't worry , if she gets elected, it'll be my personal pleasure to lick your tears dry.here, here, have some milk and cookies too. no need act like a complete emotard over some selective and decontextualized quotes someone may have said under a certain situation or another. if you don't like her and what she says, don't vote for her, simple."
5/17/2010,"oh brother... i actually looked at the thread you got them from. after checking a few posts it just became blatantly clear that you are ripping things out of context again. did not continue to check further.and you still whine about ppl not responding to this garbage? and like stated b4: get pretty much anyones chatlogs and forum posts and you can 'prove' just about anything about them. if you had mine you could prolly 'prove' i was a pedophile, a white supremacist, a ****-jew with a leather fetish, a communist, a capitalist, a terrorist, a homosexual tranny and a gangsta rapper."
5/17/2010,"no, seriously, stop trolling. disagreeing with you is not trolling. claiming it is, is trolling. having different priorities than you is not trolling, nor is the definition of having the wrong priorities ""disagreeing with you"". claiming it is, you guessed it. just stop trolling. speaking of which: calling ank's own words ""smears"" just shows that you are willing to use obvious lies in order to troll in support of her. stop it. wow, you guys hit the talking points real quick. if you can't handwave away ank's own words as ""smears"", then, why, they must be ""out of context""! except, of course there's still no context in which those comments aren't nuts. unless of course your claim is that before all those quotes, ank said ""i don't really believe that..."" otherwise, she was endorsing the ideas. the ideas are nuts. therefore, there is no context in which endorsing nuts ideas is not nuts. but please, provide the full quotes and show us the context in which her words become non-nuts."
5/17/2010,"since context is so important, please re-read this chat log posted in it's entirety, no lack of context possible...edit: posting things that people say can show you something about that person.. whodathunkit"
5/17/2010,"wow, some people do really have ""problems"" do start such a smear campaign against a candidate... disgusting...however ankh has my vote. i like the topics and her focus in the csm and i think she will represent my play style and me as a player very good. and i think she can seperate her very own opinions from her work as a csm.i wish you good luck ankh, don't let those trolls bother you"
5/17/2010,"1) i never claimed disagreeing with me is trolling, that's the spin you are giving to it. claiming i am claiming that disagreeing with me is trolling, is well, trolling. 2) having quotes from someone where he or she uses strong language is better material for 'making someone look bad'(some ppl might call it smearing ) than argueing about how you should list unpaid work on your resume. don't tell me you can't see that simple fact?3) and yes, they are taken out of context, go see for yourself. like the part about 'psycho virgins' or something. ank is quoted calling players something like that. what the quote does not show is that she only copied that of the previous poster."
5/17/2010,that's because everything that has been quoted was not out of context at all. it showed your ignorance and i'm afraid to say malignance in it's fullest and sadest glory.everytime somebody disagrees with you and backs it up with arguments you dismiss it as troll. at first i thought you were just beining dim but in the run of this thread it kinda appeared to me you really believe that. it appears you're the kind of weltfremd person who lives in her own fanatasy believing herself somekind of genius. you will dismiss all critizism and experiences to the contrary as false or as personal attacks.why do you think the other carebear candidates are not getting the responses you get?
5/17/2010,finally a substantive critique. unfortunately i don't think the context makes ankh look any better: but by all means read the original thread.edit: also snipe
5/17/2010,"whoa!stop the presses! ank is definitely guilty of counter-trolling someone on the forums, two years ago!...the biggest lulz ofc is how you guys still totally fail to realize how retarded it is be so incredibly hung-up and butthurt over such things."
5/17/2010,"you just did right above. you just said that if someone believes that her resume is significant then they are just ""nit picking"" and trolling. that was you, saying it, just now. why is it that so many of ank's supporters argue this way? they'd be liars engaged in trolling. the point is not that she ""used bad language"", but that she endorsed a number of insane ideas that would hurt eve. you know this, because people have told you over and over and over again and yet you dishonestly describe it in terms you know to be false. - you posted one thing, if you want to refute more, you need to actually do that. - as it is, you didn't even refute that one quote, as nothing changes in full context. someone says ""it's just a game. people who get so upset about an internet space game are obviously antisocial psychopathic virgins."" ank responds ""people that use a game to get their enjoyment by frustrating other people definately are antisocial psychopatic virgins""it is dishonest for you to claim that this somehow shows that she wasn't saying what she said.but yes, miya is right, progress is being made. now instead of claiming that those who disagree with you about the importance of things are trolling, accept that people can have subjective preferences without trolling ank (even if you really, really like her). and if you claim that quotes are out of context, show how the context actually changes them. all we've seen so far is that in response to someone saying that people who get upset about eve are psychopathic virgins, ank endorsed the idea that gankers are psychopathic virgins. that doesn't absolve her by any means."
5/17/2010,pro tip: posting a smiley in every post does not make you look less ******ed and butthurt. the other way around actually.
5/17/2010,it pleases me to see how closely you've been following every post of mine.
5/17/2010,"this whole thread, has sold me on ank*nametolongtotype*kah. the amount of fear, drooling, hate spewing, and stalking generated by the simple mention of her name speaks volumes. she has the nullsec / lowsec/ ganker warriors afraid, and thats a good thing. fear the ankbear for she will one day rule the galaxy.she gets all 5 of my votes :d"

5/17/2010,"hopefully for me! well, i'm all in favor of ""payback's a *****"" in eve, so any proposal that lets people give douches a good douching starts out with one point in its favor imho. as my #2 son says, ""touch<U+FFFD> douch<U+FFFD>!""but to get a game mechanic proposal seriously considered, you not only have to make the case that it will add to the game, but come up with an absolutely minimal set of changes that you think will have the desired result. the smaller and more elegant the change, the more likely it will get considered.a big part of what a csm delegate ought to do imho is help players craft proposals that stand a chance of getting adopted."

5/17/2010,"i already stated my views on fleet fights before. local ~700 is fine. i don't want to see such fights gone, like some candidates do. but lag is a problem. problem, which csm can not fix. only ccp can do this. i, as many others, want to enjoy lagless fights. but i'm concentrating on things, which we can influence. like improving fleet experience, by fixing little, but annoying things. for example, everybody have seen fleet management window. this window can be very annoying in large fleets, when many people are joining and other are leaving, it's impossible to do anything then. you can not change wing/squad commanders, because window automatically scrolls to the top. it's nearly impossible to find yourself in the long list. and it's just plainly frustrating. so, if you think that large fleet fights = bad, then i'm not your candidate, but if you enjoy fighting in large fleets and you would want to have more pleasant experience, then i'm definitely candidate you should vote for."
5/17/2010,"as a low sp pilot i want to know if there has been any thought of doing a review of all the t1 ships, going back and ensuring that they still are performing as they were originally intended in today's world.i feel that with all the game mechanic and mod changes that these ships no longer perform as intended and you get what we see today; which are a handful of t1 hulls being used in abundance while the majority are barely seen other than gimmick fits."

5/17/2010,"t'amberfirst, thanks for the free events and everything. i'm fairly new to eve, and might not have gotten interested in the csm process if it wasn't for the promotions run by other well established players such as yourself and avalloc. so thank you for getting me interested.in the interview with the tribune you briefly mentioned that you'd like to see the mini profession of bountyhunting worked on. could you be more specific on how you'd like to see the bounty system fixed or reworked? are transferable killrights part of you plan? thanks for your response."
5/17/2010,you have my vote
5/17/2010,"hi,some good news, as you may or may not be aware - there are quite a few candidates who support enhancing the bounty hunting system which means it will definately be submitted again! some bounty hunting proposals have already been submitted through the csm however, and ccp replied with;soveriengnty.. lols.. um lets ignore that for now shall we... this doesn't mean we can't champion it again though! i'll be promoting lana torrin's new bounty system as a backbone to a new system (which seems to be the most popular proposal so far) and although i'm not 100% on her system of skills. to compliment this proposal i'd also include dierdra vaals, which would introduce transferable killrights, and change bounties to a new contract type (this was submitted to ccp during csm2).transferable killrightsbounty hunting improvements (csm2)more bounty hunting improvements (dierdra vaal version)comment welcome.-t'amber"

5/17/2010,you have my vote (x2) oh hallowed horned one!
5/17/2010,you made a mistake in your mistake.
5/18/2010,that is indeed a problem i have not considered.
5/18/2010,"in eve there is a problem with the availability of me and pe research slots for the general public. at the same time pos labs often have available research me and pe slots that aren't used. as it as already been suggested in the past it would be very useful to upgrade the pos laboratories functionality opening those slots to the general public for a fee. probably programming this feature would be difficult, but it will open a new player managed market (renting research slots) with healthy competition, something that is always welcome in eve. on a relate note, it would be nice to find a solution for the old problem with copy and invention slots that can't be shared outside the corporation, but as it is apparently a programming nightmare i am not including it in the main proposal."
5/18/2010,self support
5/18/2010,"sounds good in theory except for when your enemies or competitors fill up all your labs with long-term jobs and then cancel them, leaving your labs shut down and their bpos safe and available for their own personal use. the proposal is good and i would support it if it were modified to cover as many eventualities as possible."
5/18/2010,"i think the problem with copy and invention is that you have to have access to the hangars on the labs themselves. this isn't a requirement for standard research if you have the appropriate skills (scientific networking, iirc).that said, you do not even need to have access to the physical pos itself in order to use the me & pe research slots contained on it as long as you possess the requisite skills. i, for one, would love to be able to rent out research slots to the public.as a possible solution to the problem with invention and copying, you could make the lab accept materials from the user's personal hangar, as long as it was in the same system (if you need an rp explanation, say robotic drones carry the material out to the lab and bring back the finished results). but i agree with venkul that should be a separate proposal.tl;dr: supporting the op's main idea - letting us rent out me & pe slots to the public.edit:you could allow pos's with public slots to charge a cancellation fee, and then set it ridiculously high. so even if they do this, they're paying through the nose to do it.another possibility would be to fix the slots so they actually release when the job is cancelled (which, imo, is the way they should have been in the first place). or, alternatively, to hold the bpo until the slot is released or until the lab is taken offline.also, at least in the case of our corporation, we'd probably reserve at least one or two of the labs strictly for corporate use. so even if they fill up the public labs, we still have our own slots that we weren't renting out anyway."
5/18/2010,"i strongly support this proposal, i am always looking for slots."
5/18/2010,"not sure why this would be a problem, as they are still paying for those slots for that time anyway, so it certainly wouldn't hurt the corp that made them available. second, if you get a lab that's full of canceled jobs, you can always unanchor and re-anchor the lab (not sure if you also need to repackage it...), and all those slots will be freed again.that said, i'm not supporting this, as it would make lowsec even less worthwhile than it is now. long wait times for research act as a good reason for researchers to seek out lowsec and have their corps erect a pos out there."
5/18/2010,"speaking from experience, that's not entirely accurate - at least not since the introduction of wormholes. i think a lot of corps would probably risk class 1 wh space before they tried lowsec, simply because it limits the size of the ships an attacking force can bring in to bash your pos. it is, potentially, safer that high sec (a la no battleships), unless someone is actually building ships inside the wormhole."
5/18/2010,"well, for starter your enemy would pay for the privilege of shutting down part of your service, secondarily you don't need to make all the slots available to the general public. remember that not only your pos slot will be used up but the enemy character science slot would be used, too. i think that people shutting down poses would be a bigger problem than enemies filling your lab slots. my opinion is that if the laboratory owner shut down the pos/lab the job should be immediately canceled and the fee refunded. if the job owner stop was the one to stop the job he should get no refund instead."
5/18/2010,"csm1 asked for this to happen, if i'm not mistaken, and ccp said no. the pos mechanics simply don't allow it, and as with all pos changes, ccp is deathly afraid to touch the code. so as much as i'd like this to happen, it won't."
5/18/2010,"i think it was about the copy/invention slots. i know that the pos code is the problem, for that reason i have limited the main proposition to me and pe research. seeing hot that part of the pos labs function can be shared with other people i think that the functionality can be extended to more people. to make the changes to the code as limited as possible it will probably require players to be in a corporation and to have a hangar in system. an update from ccp, even saying ""it is not feasible"" would be useful."
5/18/2010,i think every csm has asked ccp to change poses in some significant way. my fingers are crossed that they eventually get the message.edit: support.
5/18/2010,to not open a can of worms to actually see this happen i'd like it to be based upon standings.the idea i certainly like.
5/18/2010,"supported but noting there are actually 5 gang warfare subsystems.i dont see any mining links there. however a variation i would note to be considered.the fleet doesnt actually need to know the link bonuses.perhaps the fleet composition tool should have this information in order for the fleet boss to allocate members around as needed, fleet composition already shows ship type and fleet/wing/squad command levels, it would make sense to include gang link/booster info there."
5/18/2010,"...i want to wet mine and use it in pvp. yes, i think this should definitely be added as one of those little easter egg items. i'd keep one in my hold at all times!"
5/18/2010,we need towels!
5/18/2010,"go my supportthanks for the ""forgot to tick"" lol"
5/18/2010,you forgot the tick.
5/18/2010,i also want to make it possible to have an avatar that just wears said towel
5/18/2010,"i find the lack of towels disturbing, every weary traveller should carry one with him."
5/18/2010,"this is the most serious case of seriousness i have ever seen.towels or gtfo, ccp."
5/18/2010,if you do not support the pod goo has won.
5/18/2010,confirming that the op is a hoopy frood indeed.
5/18/2010,this is unacceptable
5/18/2010,the development plans of implementing towels in eve have been on display in the alpha centauri office of ccp for 50 years now. you have my approval!
5/18/2010,"i fail to see why there are no towels in the game, towels are our life. towels mean we can be prepared for any situation, with the trusty towel by our side i'm sure even the most scared of carebears will venture into low-sec to brave the pirate hordes.supported by 42 you answer for everything an anything with more of everything thrown in."
5/18/2010,"i'll support this proposal but only if we can get some towel boys to go with those towels. and also, tribe:  miss ya, sweetie."
5/18/2010,nice idea.quick question on how you envisage accessing bpos as items for transit.ie currently i drop all my bpos into a small can and transport them as cargo.how do you see a library entry/hanger being accessed to facilitate the function of transporting 1 or more bpos to new stations/pos hangers
5/18/2010,"i have an alt, who trained three months indu skills. we had a organized hac building operation for few months more. it was easy. dock up to a station, select a bp from corp hangar -> manufacture 500pcs. - go pvp with main -> profit.then i tried to contigniue it alone, after the corp organized project ran out. after few hours of investigation i came to a result, that i'm making much easier iskies on a belt in nullsec.this idea would make the induskills of mine usable again. would get some nice income of those three months invested in induskills ^^ps. it's simply lazieness that made me decide not to indu on my own, not that it would be frustrating or something. it's just easier to sit on a belt and killing npc imoeric"
5/18/2010,"ooooh shiney!regards,gil"
5/18/2010,1
5/18/2010,keep it up
5/18/2010,"several proposals when put together would change the bounty system to fix what is a broken game mechanic. 1) bounties are rewarded for destroying a target's ship, not just the pod.2) the amount of bounty awarded is the value of the ship lost, subtracted from the total bounty.3) killrights are tradable/sellable as per other proposals4) (optional) killrights are awarded even if the victim has attempted to defend themselves (assuming that it isn't the case now)5) bountied losses do not receive insurance6) a bounty can not be collected against a wartarget7) bounties can only be placed on someone with a negative sec status, fellow corp members, or people who have quit your corp within the last 24 hours.8) a character can buy off a bounty on themselves by paying the amount of the bounty which gets refunded to those who placed the bounty.expected results: tradeable killrights allow bounty hunting to be pursued in highsec. ship based bounties with no insurance means that the bounty loss will actually be a loss no matter the situation. not being able to collect a bounty against wartargets and not being able to put bounties on players with a positive sec status would remove the ability to use bounties as a harassment tool. these changes would mean bounties would be useful, fun, and balanced."
5/18/2010,"not bad ideas, but they don't actually solve the problem. which is that the person with a bounty on him/her can collect the bounty very easily with an alt.second problem, which is specific to your ideas, is that sec status can be made positive with a bit of work. not that i really understand what you're going for with the whole sec status thing anyways (which is itself a crappy mechanic)."
5/18/2010,"yes someone can collect the bounty with their alt, but the max bounty they can collect is the value of the ship and won't get both bounty and insurance, so there is no advantage in doing so.yes, negative sec status can be fixed with work, but to do so would mean that a fairly significant portion of their gameplay will be spent fixing sec status and not pirating. the goal of the sec status restriction is to make sure bounties aren't used to grief non-combat characters. a non-combat character won't have a negative sec status. an alternative or addition to that restriction could be if it were easier to gain killrights, bounties could be allowed against those you have killrights, making bounties even more of a revenge system. the big disadvantage to either killrights or sec status limitations is that bounties won't really exist in 0.0, but since right now bounties don't matter it would still be an improvement. so ultimately i stand by my proposal.(also +1 support for my own idea. :) )"
5/18/2010,i like the idea of bounties being linked to the value if the ship destroyed.would bounties awarded for a pod kill be up to the value of a target's replacement clone?
5/18/2010,i'll bump this once a day until next september
5/18/2010,"supporting, as i was the one that proposed these changes, i would like to know what happened to my proposal."
5/18/2010,supported because destroyers are next to useless in my opinion and because changes are never a bad thing
5/18/2010,"more then likely the way these things work is not by scanning your hard drive for what you have on it, but for what is running in memory.your anti-virus does it, your firewall does it, what is the difference between those and a game having access to whats in system memory?"
5/18/2010,"the difference is that anti-virus software looks for a general signature or pattern in the code on the computer (both on the hdd and ram), whereas the scanning software for a game should only be looking for something in a specific list of software packages. so game scanning software (like punkbuster) are less intrusive (privacy wise) than anti-virus software."
5/18/2010,"i would support this assuming protection for false positives. i've literally had a $600 worth of hardware destroyed by software (which i thought was impossible at the time) that was trying to protect against copy protection. i would expect a phased deployment beyond the current system. phase 1 would be a system test program that ran the scan but didn't do anything except warn you that you might have suspicious software installed with a way to research the specific software and contest the results. this system would also apply to trial accounts. after a few months of that system live on tq (you would need major data sets to work out the false positives,) i would expect phase 2 would not ban accounts, but hamper them in some way, like locking login or forcing logoff while the macro software is detected running."
5/18/2010,you can't use technology to solve a social problem.
5/18/2010,"this is the same as saying that ccp shouldn't have fixed the exploit last month that allowed certain players to avoid local for a period of time and immediately jump on thier prey. there was a whole big uproar over that exploit pages and pages of comments in the thread. this is not a social problem. this is a legal problem, it is a clear violation of the eula. ccp is well within their right to seek the most cost effective approach to solving the game. you as a player also have the right to stop playing the game. in the hypothetical, i believe you like many player who played the other game, would continue to ***** to high holy h*ll about the way the problem was solved but ultimately you would continue playing the game because of the time youve already invested. scream privacy you would still play.i dont really take issue with all you people who ***** about macros believe that its a ccp problem should address. i am absolutely dumbfounded in the fact that so many people here assume the absolute worst in the people who write the code to bring the content. seriously, how is it that you play the game day in  day out when youre perspective is that the game is brought to you by evil intent ccp?"
5/18/2010,"you lost me at 'scans your machine'. last thing i need is yet another company who feels entitled to push invasive drm-like crap on me simply because they let me play a game.wholeheartedly not supported.i like my own idea a lot better, to be honest. instead of painstakingly analyzing server logs, in a once-every-5-years 'holy rage' op, make cloaky npc belt rats that recognize bot patterns, and who come out to shoot the macro-miner with concord-like deadly firepower."
5/18/2010,"not 'the absolute worst' perhaps; but, venturing a guess, i reckon a lot of people feel, that while ccp may not be particularly fond of macro-miners, they're purposely turning a blind eye to them, because those thousands of russian macro-miners are also each paying $15 a month."
5/18/2010,"we have no rational fear?honestly, my issue revolves around fleet fights. some fleet fights strain even the best computers, add another process that is constantly scanning your computer in the background and eve takes several steps back from the lofty ""need for speed"" concept."
5/18/2010,"there are server side methodologies which have not been used.ai which look at hours played, actions of ship, financial.define that which is typical player, then flag that which is not.at point when activity passes threshold, activity monitor this person.scanning of client side is lazy method and unacceptable to many.in the system in which i have been based for many weeks very close to 0.0, i see one player in hulk which is obvious bot. always online when i log in at random times of day. repetitious behavior, hour after hour, i log in and leave system.. she is there.. i come back she is still there.. i login in middle of day or night.. she is there.. always there. in many weeks, she has never not been there. she start after downtime every day and is there all day.detect the obvious on server side is solution.ccp does not know player hours played? systems visited? items sold? time range of items sold? modules used? if i mine 23/7 i am not bot? maybe i just love to mine?looking in the users computer is not option.. i usually get kiss before someone touch my stuff."
5/18/2010,"i vote against.salvage drones would give too big an advantage to salvage thieves. it would mean salvage thieves could run salvage from 50+km, or over 100km with a good fit. ninja salvaging is already a griefing mechanic, we don't need it any easier."
5/18/2010,"salvage doesn't belong to anyone, and thus, there can be no salvage thieves. since there can be no salvage thieves, salvage thieves can not get any kind of advantage.salvage drones would mean that you get the option to either be more effective in combat with normal drones, or make a bit more money from it. seems fine to me. would even make it easier for people complaining about professional salvagers (what they call thieves) to salvage while they are fighting, so that there are no more wrecks available if anyone warps in.seems fair enough to me."
5/18/2010,this assumes that only ninjas can have salvage drones. it would make salvaging easier on the mission runner as well. /support
5/18/2010,salvage drones would actually quite a big boost to mission runners.but what the hell: supported anyway. nothing wrong with comptetive rewards.
5/18/2010,"it will be made everywhere, this way people will have to use their brains in fleet fights and no one will be able to blob to the point where everyone is just a number for their alliances causeso lets say theres 250 people vs 500 people, this would be classed as blobbing too however since all the serious players / alliances are in 0.0 they would easily (with the help of many naps) be able to fill the remaining quantity.so when the battle changes to 500 vs 500, people will have to make a decision, either lose money and fight or be forced to lower numbers"
5/18/2010,"ping!regards,gil"
5/18/2010,not supported.it is already possible to kill a ship on a jump bridge/cyno beacon at a armed pos if you know what your doing.that the op hasn't figured out how to do so is no reason to change the nature of this module.
5/18/2010,"some people obviously haven't tried to gank at the jump bridges. it's done so easily and so often, that there is no need to move them to the planets. i have seen even freighters to die at the jump bridge and smaller ships die constantly by the hands of stealth bomber pilots."
5/18/2010,"someone else did. one of those topics that come back once in a while, was stupid idea back then, is still stupid idea.and pretty sure you cant online cyno generator arrays in cyno jammed systems."
5/18/2010,"you can, because you can link jump bridges to them."
5/18/2010,"ahem ...""a proper sansha fleet with 1 titan, 1-2 supercarrier, a few carriers and support fleet of faction ships, 100 or so total""against a ragtag fleet without any capital ship, no chain of command, no time to organize the fleet right, mostly made up by pve people.you see nothing wrong in this picture herschel?it is an event made to entertain players. not a training course for 0.0 battles. killing a titan, especially a well supported and well tanked titan, using bs and smaller ships is a long process. fighting a 100 man fleet (even if 90% of it is made by ai controlled ships) with several capital and supercapitals in high sec would be a nightmare. or you want to limit events to low sec where alliances would bring well organized fleets if the payout is good enough?note that a good ai could potentially be more damaging than a fleet of the same size managed by players as it will be capable of more efficient focus fire."
5/18/2010,"i agree. as long as it is done above-board and not ""steered"" towards powerful 0.0 factions on the basis of favoritism.my sense of the gist of this thread is that people are getting bent about killmails of expensive ships with failfits. wha-wha-what!? we're looking to be in the business of quality-controlling killmails now? failfits don't count? that's funny. :thumbsdown: not supported."
5/18/2010,i support this with the exception of the most excellent concord special ops bs that rote kapelle took down.you'll only get that kill from my cold dead hands.
5/18/2010,"that is really what the problem boils down to.it would be worth having. people would be much more willing to participate and such events would be a considerably bigger deal.if a fleet like that showed up, people would come to fight it. people including those who can kill such ships. can you imagine how giddy empire pilots would be to be involved in taking out super caps?a side note, i was sad to see a lack of real faction caps. hearing about these events had me hoping for some monstrous true sansha carriers with spikes sticking out in all directions."
5/18/2010,"you missed the part where i said that you'd give at least an hour of advance notice. we've already had events with a supercarrier supported by large numbers of faction battleships, and the players won that with zero advance notice. give people a couple hours to get deployed, and you'll get considerably more strength in place, along with time to shake down at least a semblance of a chain of command. i expect it'll be fine. and worst case, the players lose a roleplay event. if they get trashed, make the fleet smaller the next time."
5/18/2010,"ok, now explain to me how you can make that feasible in high sec? and if you limit it to low sec and the rewards are good enough how you think to keep alliance fleets from getting all the goodies?give reasonable rewards to convince people to bring and risk a capital ship fleet and you will start hearing cries of favoritism (and risk node shutdown), make the reward too low and no one will bring the cap fleet. the events so far are aimed to non organized groups, allowing ""thrown together"" fleets to work after a fashion, even if not really efficiently. that allow the ""common joe"" to participate in this kind of event. make it so that it require a well organized fleet an you will make it an exclusive for large corps and alliances. pve content is already weak in eve, making more of the top end pve (mixed pve/pvp in this particular case) accessible only to alliances wouldn't be a bright idea from ccp part. you really think an hour will make a difference?you either have the cap fleet or you haven't it. giving an hour notice would simply mean that (if the rewards are good enough to warrant a cap fleet use) some alliance will claim the operation and shut every other player out. and we will heard the cries of ""it was near alliance x territory, it is favoritism."""
5/18/2010,"hershel, they are meant to be fun roleplay/pve, you are still not going up against enemyu fleet, that you can do in null-sec. i don't think ccp whants it to wtf pwn all carebared by dropping 50 nighmares out of a wormhole that deal 1k+ dps each. that's a bit too rough."
5/18/2010,"super caps can be taken down by subcaps. the difference in tank between a super cap and a normal cap is nothing more than buffer.if you can break the tank of a capital ship, you can break the tank of a super cap."
5/18/2010,"again, they've already done events with two dozen nightmares and a wyvern. with zero advance notice. how is my proposal unreasonable in comparison to that? and assuming the lag was kept under control, i can think of few things more fun than a fleet fight that's open to the masses."
5/18/2010,"ok i am a mining most of the time and all i have is time to think of thing to ***** about and most the time i dont get chapped over them but there r some change that would be a welcome change to the game. the frist thing is that u make a ship, the rorqual. it is a cap ship just like the orca but it cant go in to high sec. witch for me sux because there both cap ship. i dont quite under stand what ccp is thinking here but if u dont want release the rorqual to high sec can u at least let station compact ore and ice for a fee. and i also have alot of ship that are rigged out and would like a ship mantaince bay to carry up to say 6 battel ship of space so that i can move my crago ship and mining ships and so on with out losing the riggings. my last point is my big one for me to buy stuff and have no lab tell me what sec of space it can be used in just sux buttox so in the marker or dicrition of a item would u be so kind as to clue people in what is high sec or low sec only please. thanks kinadyan"
5/18/2010,"i think kinadyan has a few good points. perhaps not elliquantly spoken, but it seems that he is trying to say that getting some explnations would be nice, and perhaps some reperations for equpment locked to hostle space (ie: low sec). also i think it would be helpfull if ships were listed by some sort of rateing system in there description. at the vary least something that listed the minimum and maximum security space that paticular ship can travle in."
5/18/2010,"orcas are capital ships in the same sense that freighters are capital ships. they use capital components in their construction, but they use gates and can be built in highsec. rorquals fall into the same category as dreads and carriers - the ""true capitals"" if you will. they can't be built in highsec, they can't use gates, they require the capital ships skill, and they have a module that anchors them in place while unlocking the ship's true capacity(siege/triage/industrial core). yes, they look the same to a builder, but they are very different. re mineral compression in highsec, it already exists - it's called a 50% refinery in almost every station. refine it into minerals, and move the minerals. they're invariably smaller(especially for ice). re hauling of rigged battleships, you have a couple options. a high-skill freighter can generally haul two at a time if you set a courier contract. you can move them to lowsec and haul two in a carrier's ship maintenance array. you can fly a shuttle one way and a battleship the other until they're all moved. or you can sell them in place and buy new ones. all these are annoying, but moving rigged battleships should be a little bit annoying."
5/18/2010,"that's a mighty negative stance indeed. wanting something to be a (=) fail is bad enough, but if he wants it to be less than a fail is....worrying. do we really need more **** stuff?"
5/18/2010,unfortuneatly the op is right.
5/18/2010,"just imagine 50.000 pilots building on the exact same spot on a planet just to **** off someone and there is nothing that one person can do about it.yeah he could order a planetary assault strike to be executed on the dust side of things by contracting some forces to assault 50.000 bases build by 50.000 pilots.i see an isk problem for the dude, sins his pi base only makes him 0.5 mill a day if not less. in other words no one is going to be fighting in dust sins no one is going to pay them to."
5/18/2010,nothing stops the dude from moving elsewhere?
5/18/2010,"actually building right over top depletes that area faster and eventually each person there will only be pulling the minimum so it's kind of pointless unless your just doing it for greifing goodness. as for dust well we know absolutely nothing about how pi will be tied into that. for the profits you are presupposing you actually know what value the goods pi produces are going to be sold for, but we wont know that until a month or two into release."
5/18/2010,"here's a theory based upon the analysis of a variety of sources. pi is not intended as simply another feature of eve. it is intended to provide a hook (inducement to play) for dust514 and in the end provide a synergy in play and marketing for both dust514 and eve.dust514 needs a hook. if released on its own merit it might be just another combat game. good, but not a killer stand out from the crowd. released with the hook of being able to interact with eve? that's a very interesting hook and will favorably affect marketing of dust.how to get eve players to interact with dust514? get eve players hooked on pi. give them a taste for pi. let everyone who wants to get into it, get into it. let them build infrastructure. let them become annoyed with people building on top of them and affecting their isk flow.next, start up dust514. no interaction with eve yet. just build familiarity with the game mechanisms. build player combat groups. figure out tactics. attract interest from eve players who know what comes next.finally, let eve and dust514 interact. eve players want to protect the infrastructure they've built, conquer the competition to increase their isk flow and must use the players of dust514 to achieve this.this will occur in all areas of eve regardless of sec status of the solar system and is not exclusively a factor in territoriality/sovereignty.ultimately, pi will not fail. in all likelyhood it will achieve its goal and make a great deal more sense once dust514 interaction is fully deployed.regards,windjammer"
5/18/2010,"that last part is true. 0.0 sec is safer than parts of low sec.as to moons being absurdly profitable...technetium 37k isk/unit (3.7m/hour)dysprosium 20k isk/unit (2m/hour)promethium 15k isk/unit (1.5m/hour)first, you can see why the sc wants northern moons now, as opposed to their old school dyspro/prom cash cows.second, you can see how little each are worth by themselves compared to ratting/mining for the same period of time. third, these moons are defended by 1000-3000 characters, so in a per capita sense, they are worth little more than 1-4 million isk per month per character per moon (and that's for the high end moons). as compared to an r&d agent which can net a character roughly 10m/month per agent per character.lastly, r&d agents are completely safe passive revenue. you don't have to worry about someone taking your agent.so, if you want to complain about passive income sources, you need to look at the ones that net the most per capita passive income. if an alliance could magically get all their characters to train to use 5 r&d agents each and take the profit from this, they would be rolling in more isk than an alliance holding a dozen high end moons."
5/18/2010,"i'd just add a caveat: no gcc from non-gcc rr in lowsec, but if you rr a -10 in highsec, you do get gcc.e: forgot my thumb"
5/18/2010,"concord doesn't spawn when a -10 enters highsec - that's the faction police. so aggression should naturally go to the faction police, not concord. and no, that doesn't make a license to kill noobs in high sec since concord still responds as is appropriate.-liang"

5/18/2010,"ok so i had a decent post written to reply but the forums ate it and i'm pretty lazy, so, instead i'll just say ""fair enough"""
5/18/2010,"people of the assembly hall, we have a grave threat facing us as we speak. a tide of foul, depraved threads lurk beneath the surface of this once noble and great forum, ready to ensnare and drag down the innocent into a world full of twisted corruption.friends, i propose that we bring down the divine wrath of the hallowed moderators on people who are obviously seeking to defile this most sacred forum, and have their presence purged from our souls.tl;dr i think people who are obviously trolling, and seriously, its really not hard to tell should be banned outright for posting crap in the assembly hall. some recent threads come to mind, where the moderators seem to be clearing out all the trolls except for the one that matters: the op.i'm not saying ban everyone who has a bad idea, but seriously, is it so hard not to tell a mistaken idea from a troll?"
5/18/2010,"and yes, i'll probably be banned too then, but its a price i'm willing to pay."
5/18/2010,"plz ccp it was finally for awhile but it has become overly rampant, stop the obvious and serious (repeat offender) trolls so that this forum can be for actual proposals. /signed"
5/18/2010,"its about time ccp took care of something that is out of hand, serious posts only plz."
5/18/2010,"in an ideal world, you'd probably do it something like this:1. idea is put in f&i, which now has a support thing like the assembly hall at the moment.2. idea is supported by (insert whatever number you want) people3. it is moved to the assembly hall, where it is still debated on.4. csm take issue to ccp.5. ccp implement it/explain why they're not going to implement it.that way the players will self moderate the forums, but that's never going to happen."
5/18/2010,"supportededit had to remove my support as there was a pointer to towel hate, i can't risk towels getting banned.i like towels."
5/18/2010,"just because an idea is out of the box and you feel threatened by it dont assume it is trolling, theres alot of great ideas from people like emo tj for example and tbh you guys just bully his ideas now :(i say if you dont agree to something explain why but accept that people are not all square"
5/18/2010,please do not question moderation. thank you.
5/18/2010,i fear it is not only the assembly that needs a heavier hand but also f&i. stick a tl;dr version of the commonly broken forum rules beneath the login area and start enforcing them.
5/18/2010,this is something i have to fully support.
5/18/2010,letting the trolls run riot does not help the credibility of the csm.
5/18/2010,there is nothing more that really needs to be added.supported.
5/18/2010,this.ccp is pretty lenient with the trolls in other sections and i have no problems with that but keep them out of here. this is a place for reasonable mature discussions not pointless and meaningless babble.
5/18/2010,this. we are not talking about banning yet another hurt noob that believes that we should be able to shoot ninja salvagers (me being one of them) we will ban people that ask for towels. we will delete topics that ask for doomsday devices on rifters. we will ban people that ask us to ban the entire pandemic legion (even if they deserve it)
5/18/2010,you lost my support here
5/18/2010,a yes/no vote that changes the ranking of a post would really fix this problem better than mods deleting horrible proposals.
5/18/2010,ccp hath forsaken us.
5/18/2010,"got my vote :)regards,gil"
5/18/2010,"i ment they used th old ui.do you oppose this, or not support it (aka idk)?"
5/18/2010,"i do not support the proposal as it stands, because there needs to be variety in prices. i do support it as a complex solution under following circumstances:different types of rats enhabit didferent sleeper complexesthey drop different proportions of different lootsdifferent ships and subsystems requre these materials in different proportionsyou can choose what you want to invent, different prices are achieved by different building materials. \so yes and no at the same time. yes as part of a small t3 production revamp, on it's own, probably no."
5/18/2010,"what ???? you can not be serious on this one. do you understand that by buying the preferred subsys, you subsidize the less desirable ones? do you have any remote knowledge of the market? your proposition does not make any sense.look at the curse and the pilgrim, they cost roughly the same. sure, why should it be otherwise? they are made of virtually the same components.yet, the curse is traded roughly two times more often, as it is more popular. why should it be different for the t3 subsystems?in fact your suggestion would make the preferred components vastly overpriced. look at caldari hybrid tech decryptors, they already cost 20 times as much as the other races decryptors. that's what happens when the premium and crap products require different materials, the price difference goes through the roof.it is also nonsense from a game balance point of view, as you would have to rebalance the materials as well, should you choose to rebalence the subsystem.i would also like to mention that different sleeper types already inhibit different complexes and that they already drop materials in different proportions."
5/18/2010,gets my thumb
5/18/2010,"then how does pos bowling still exist? it happens. i cannot attest to the frequency or how small a ship can be bumped outside a pos, but the article in op is evidence pos bowling still happens.titans are not the only supercapitals that can be affected by this."
5/18/2010,"it doesn't. what must have happened was that they managed to get the pos password, and then they warped in some capitals, with the correct password allowing them to enter, and used those to bump out the titan."
5/18/2010,this...otherwise they would have flown off with the ship in all honesty.
5/18/2010,pos bowling is fixed for quite some time now..
5/18/2010,execution pos bowling is instant player account termination according to ccp regulations.if there still in game then they must have had the pos shield password.ccp will have to check all players involved in killing the ship to see if one or more of them entered the pos shield password that day around that time.if they had used the pos shield password then they had all the right to kill the ship.
5/18/2010,"what is the point of the whole standings system if a simple password is all it takes to bypass it?pos shields should behave like a solid object to anyone without blue standings regardless of access to password. create a pos setting tickbox to allow pass to override standings (ie. as is) if need be.people can still pull their lame-ass meta-gaming to bump a ship out but it would require burning the infiltrator .. risk/reward.the mass dependent bumping mechanic is already in game as far as i know, whether it could do with a tweak is another matter"
5/18/2010,"if you don't have the password, you warp to 10km outside the pos. if you have the password, you can warp right to the pos. this isn't an exploit, this is bad security. a costly mistake.this dev blog promises an end to this silliness. poses will be able to be set based on alliance standings."
5/18/2010,"no, it doesn't actually. standings are not used to give access to the forcefield, so this will only mean that you don't have to set everyone blue on corp level to prevent your towers from actually firing on people."
5/18/2010,"1) the dread that collided with the titan was friendly, so it had the pos password.2) this is not pos bowling, you obviously have no idea what pos bowling is, or was, so i will explain it to you:band of brothers was probably the most prolific abuser of said crime, where, 3 or 4 titans were warped at 0 to an enemy control tower, of course being ejected again since they didn't have the password (the fields were porous then, you could penetrate at speed, but would then be ejected). upon ejection, collision mechanics would drive other ships out at great speeds as the titans left the pos. the bob fleet would usually be hot on the heels of the titans, raping everything that got cleared from the shields.this was fixed three years ago.now, shields are solid state, warping to a tower, when you do not have the password, stops you a few km from the shield edge- read that as the leading edge of your ship is stopped a few km short.unless, you have the pos password.you sir, need a game mechanics review before this goes any further, as obviously, you are ill informed about how towers, caps, and super caps properly work in todays eve.yea, sure, we could make pos shields standings dependent, then, when you keep a bunch of crap floating in your towers (like spare dictors and logistics that many alliances leave in high value pos), i can simply get an alt in to a group blue to you, and come take all that stuff.no, actually, thats a terrible idea."
5/18/2010,"i kinda like that idea. ""spy"" alts will actually have to be in the fleet/pos to accomplish their ends."
5/18/2010,"not really, if your pos is set to allow blues in, and you leave something in it, me, with blue standings, can swing by that pos any time of the 23 hour day i want to ""liberate"" the item from the evil pos."
5/18/2010,that's why you are in pl and i'm not blue to you.
5/18/2010,"ok, so as people play with pi and then decide it's not for them and forget about it, we may begin to see a build-up of abandoned pi colonies on planets. since decommissioning a structure does not return any isk to the player, players have no incentive to clean up after themselves. also there is no incentive to keep playing pi as you can let your colony go dormant and then pick it up again in 3 months with no bad effects.i propose 2 changes.1) pi structures degrade over time if they are not actively used. after all if you are not running production then the workers are bored and leave your facility since they have no work to do and maintenance grinds to a halt. this could be a long period of time and progress in stages such that if you have no industry running for 2 weeks the various facilities begin to suffer percentage penalties to whatever they do(extraction, production, storage, pg/cpu). after 4 weeks the degradation is worse, 6 weeks worse, etc. up until some point the structures become worth only some salvage value which is a percentage of the original isk sink used to build them. at any point prior to a facility reaching the ""salvage value"" point, it can be repaired and brought back online by the owner for a simple isk fee(like repairing a ship).2) a new item type in the ship scanner to scan for pi structures to display their current state(degrading, salvageable for example, maybe active colonies are shielded from scan). salvage drones to salvage pi structures only. after all, you are in a ship in orbit and you have to salvage this stuff on the planet's surface. the salvage is simply a generic item ""pi salvage"" that can be sold on the npc market for a percentage of the isk used to build the structure in the first place. by having an actual item instead of just giving an isk transaction into the salvager's wallet however, this provides another opportunity for pvp as there is something to take and a ship must be in orbit around the planet he is salvaging in order for the drones to work.as a side effect it also provides incentive to get out there and scan for planets with decaying infrastructure and for someone to remove it. thoughts?"
5/18/2010,"allowing people to blow them up will solve the problem. but, this works to a certain degree as well."
5/18/2010,"when we get to the point of allowing them to be blown up, you simply apply the salvaging idea to the smoking wreckage as well."
5/18/2010,"not for free, no.because they'd have to show up less. less work for them -> decent citizens get to share in the law enforcement cost saved. both profit.i think it's really a psychological thing. people have conditioned themselves to thinking ""you're nowhere safe in eve."" and i don't even disagree. but, much like in rl where people hire bodyguards and such, what is so 'eve breaking' about people buying new eden protection as well? besides, way i see it, security is just a commodity, like everything else. why should it not be marketable? nobody is laughing when i mention 'ship insurance.' why would hiring extra protection be any different? if people can afford it, why not? because it's ""a boost to old, rich players,"" as you put it? well, everything which costs isk favors rich folks: we might as well abandon the whole market then!if you were to buy a rapid response plan, only 'magic invincible npcs' would be able to get there in time. no one else can be notified and spawn out of thin air within seconds.the bounty system, as it currently stands, is pretty bogged. we can probably agree on that. 'transferable killrights' would, indeed, already be quite an improvement. like being able to outsource your kill rights to a security company you hired. gonna have to think about that some more, as player-based security options are endlessly more complicated, of course (very sensitive to fraud, for one).i still stand by the idea of having a reliable, marketable form of security, though."
5/18/2010,why not just hire a corp?
5/18/2010,"if people are ready to throw 100m isk to be protected, why not hire a corp or pay alliance dues?"
5/18/2010,someone find the km where emo died when shooting a ninja...
5/18/2010,hello! i think this is an excellent idea. it is well balanced and will make mission running in high-sec much safer. it will also force all pirates to use a hacking module in their midslot thus putting them at a severe disadvantage to me. my only worry is neuts. because npc's are easy to tank and a neuting typhoon could still kill you with the 500% repair amount increase. i suggest you add neut immunity to the trigger effects of stealing. will join your mailing list right away.
5/18/2010,you missed one.
5/18/2010,"thank you for keeping this thread tidy. haters are gonna hate i guess.anyways, back on topic.could you please be more specific on your problem with my proposal?stay on topic.stay on topic.so you think being aggroed by an entire pocket is fair while the pirates come in to gank you?"
5/18/2010,i am not sure if i support this. could the op maybe explain why we need this in more detail?
5/18/2010,here:
5/18/2010,"are we talking about lowsec or something? i have not had any issues running lvl 4s where i have had to tank both the mission and pirates. if it does concern lowsec, then i have no experience running lvl 4s there, so wouldnt know. if not, then why are pirates shooting at you?"
5/18/2010,"you don't have to tank the npc's specifically. i use 1 rep, dcii and 2x eanm's regardless of mission npc's on my pve ships. i also run missions exclusively in low sec since i'm an outlaw. and no, haven't had pirate issues. i try to ensure others do however.once again emo proves himself hopelessly inept at this game and demands an ""i win"" button because he pays his subscription. i had avoided feeding this troll but too many have taken him seriously. no additional protections are needed for players engaged in pve, there are enough as is. you just have to use that soft gelatinous mass between your ears a little."
5/18/2010,ssshhh....i'm hunting wabbits.
5/18/2010,"except that the gate is controlled by the npcs you're trying to kill. so, in reality, it should work the opposite way. the gate should need to be hacked by the mission runner, but the pirates who are ""coming to save the npcs"" (let's be honest, they aren't going to kill the npcs after killing the mission runner) should have free access."
5/18/2010,since the elections for the council began me and many others dont know who to vote for as there is many holes in what the people are saying and i was wondering if setting up a channel in eve or a thread so we can ask the cantidates directly what they are going to do. this can also be used to confirm possible rumers like the one about some council members wanting to move all l 4 missions into low sec. knowing who if anyone is in support of this or not will help people decide on who to vote for.
5/18/2010,"""csm public"" channel exists, and just about all the serious candidates poke their heads in from time to time. regarding all l4 missions being moved to lowsec, you can check the csm vote match results. only four candidates answered ""strongly support"" to that proposition - corbeau lenoir, chip mintago, avicenna sarfaraz, and darius johnson(who has since dropped from the race). only corbeau considered it an important issue. a few others were somewhat in favour. a proposition to do that might get 2/9 votes on the council if the voting goes as i expect it to, and i don't think either of those two care enough to bring it up. and even if the csm did bring it forward, i doubt ccp would change it. your l4 missions are safe."
5/18/2010,"yeah this is an off topic thread. the right forum for it is the jita park forums. however, if a csm is doing their jobs right they should be transparent in what they are doing. a good proposal should outline the issues and proposed solutions along with pros and cons of the proposed solution. a csms job is to gather the proposals, write them up in a clear way, and present them to ccp. if a csm is pushing a particular agenda or is neglectful of the player demographic, they are not doing their jobs properly and should not be supported. csms don't develop the game and they have zero decision making power. they can gather ideas and present them to ccp, and then turn around and assure us that ccp isn't as dumb as some of the dev posts make them look."
5/18/2010,"ankhesentapemkah: please post a video pronouncing your name and explaining its origin.i've heard plenty of trolls/insults/**** talking in my time playing eve, but i must say blaming a mother for her sons autism takes the cake. (autism is not hereditary, just so you know) ccp: please introduce a kind of vote which cancels out a vote for a candidate, i do not follow the csm closely so i'm not fit to vote, i do however know exactly who i don't want in csm."

5/18/2010,"1) tell me how the resume thingy is relevant then. you either are trolling, or you lack the ability to focus on the things that matter if you think that it is relevant. and that's what i said. you twisted it into ""everyone not agreeing with me is trolling"". you're setting up straw man to make me look bad. that is trolling in my book... 2) her ideas are far from insane in my book. she has very valid points if she says that outlaws have it too easy in hi sec. hell, even a lot of the pirate crowd says they don't care about sec stat cause you can still move about pretty much freely as long as you don't autopilot and hover in one spot. for the record: i don't think pirates are mentally challenged or immoral or something like that. in that respect i seem to disagree with ank.3) yes, ank threw the psycho virgins comment right back in the trolls face. or maybe you want to deny that comments like that are trolling? if you then quote only ank, you are taking things out of context, which was my point...4) no, i'm not going to nit pick about every quote and post it. anyone who does not suffer from tunnel vision can read the thread or one of the billion other threads or chatlogs posted here and see that things are taken out of context. 5)if you want to have a serious discussion, stop twisting my words and start admitting things are being taken out of context, when they are indeed taken out of context, like my example, since this repeat mode is kinda tiresome"

5/18/2010,*mental note: do not get sucked in to everlasting threadnaughts next csm election....
5/18/2010,"i like the people who prey on those too lazy to read the thread. ""oh, yeah, it's just trolling, ankh said it, but yknow, the -context-..."" there is no context in which a representative should be throwing insults at people. there is no context in which she should openly state that a demographic is inferior, and needs to be punished, not only in the context of the game but in person. yes, she did bring up a 'mental institution', and on a softer note, temporary/permenant bans for 'antisocial pvp activity'. you can cover your ears (unless you're an ankh alt, which would not surprise me) and pretend none of these things were said, or that they're out of context, but here's the rub... ankh has not denied any of those comments. she has not apologized for any of those comments. if they were not what she truly believed, i think she would say so, don't you? she's had, what, 12 pages to simply say ""i was angry at the time, i don't feel that way"" or ""my opinion has changed"" or.. yknow, anything? but she won't do that. she won't deny the statements because she still believes in them, and thinks silence is the best way to deal with it. and why not? other, bitter carebears will read that and cast a vote thinking they'll get back at all those evil mean griefers. and, so long as she can have alts / blind followers saying 'it's not real, it's out of context'.. well then. that offers protection from anyone who might be offended, provided they're easily lied to. -------- tl;dr: answer me this, if you can't answer the rest, o poorly disguised alt: how is a thread where ankh(you) rant about changes she wants to criminal activity, followed by a tirade of insults to the pvp crowd, out of context in proving that ankh is biased? you can see her opinions. they are extreme. they are openly stated in that thread, not revoked, etc. saying they're out of context is like saying that, if a politician said ""i hate <minority group> and think they are all worthless"", it would be ok as long as it was not an official press release. clearly, if it's not an 'official' (read: riddled with half truths and lies to sound good) statement, it's not how they feel, right? edit: just throwing out an 'in before' this post is ignored to pick apart something easier, or a massive rant against a single line."
5/18/2010,boost concord!boost hulk efficiency!
5/18/2010,"i may not agree with some of ank's idea's, but i must say that do agree with many of her idea's. i think having a voice on the csm that is different and shakes things up is great.love it or hate it, there is a large player base in the game that holds the same beliefs as ank. these people want their voice and ideas heard and ank will bring those ideas to ccp through the csm process if elected. eve is a sandbox, and in my opinion ank is just asking for more tools to build her idea of a great sand castle. i like that."
5/18/2010,"you realize ankh has effectively been on every csm, yes? when she hasn't been on herself, she's had a puppet on the csm. ignorance is sadly a deciding factor in elections.."
5/18/2010,"yes, that's what the whiners in this thread don't seem to comprehend...in general, i agree with ank's views. and those views extend way beyond her view on how to punish ppl who break the law in hi-sec. and i agree with her general view on that too, mainly: ganking in hi sec has too little consequences.and like me, there are a lot of ppl who support a lot of ank's viewpoints (again, those viewpoints extend way beyond her viewpoints on hi sec crime). look up her passed vote counts and tell me they were all ank alts. that's another point, nearly everyone supporting ank in this thread is called an alt at least one time. this must either be an attempt to troll the supporters or, and that would be a quite frightning thought: ppl are so narrowminded that they can't imagine anyone supporting (most of) ank's viewpoints. i would like to make a comment on the 'harsh language' being used. i don't see why you should get mad by being called 'murderous vermin' if you are indeed playing the game being 'murderous vermin'. and blowing up innocent ppl for no other reason than your own lulz or profit, well, don't be surprised if ppl tend to label that like 'anti-social behaviour'. it's a game and i can see the fun of playing the bad guy (i might even join the piwate ranks one day if only just to experience that aspect of the game) but if you are playing anti-social psycho murderous vermin. yes, ppl are going to call you that."
5/18/2010,"once again, someone manages to focus on the unimportant details and leave out the main points....he is supporting ank because he 'agrees with many of her ideas'!and his exact words are ' i think having a voice on the csm that is different and shakes things up is great.'. that does not have to mean that he supports ank cause she was never on the csm b4."
5/18/2010,"i think jita should become a trade hub to be different and shake things up.edit: i guess there are some bitter carebears who can get behind 'ban all the pvpers', though."
5/18/2010,"we've already argued that, and you know it. stop trolling. so again, if someone disagrees with you then they're trolling, or if they don't focus on only one issue and go and discuss others, why, then they're also doing something wrong. again, if you can't support ank without trolling, maybe you need to reexamine your arguments. i quoted what you, yourself, weer saying. you said that people who thought that the resume was something worth talking about (eg. disagreeing with your appraisal) were, therefore, trolling. i know that an ank-meme is ""if my own words make me look bad then you aer trolling me!"", but it's not a very effective dodge. paraphrasing her ideas doesn't get around her actual quotes. saying that people who enjoy ganking should be locked up in mental institutions is in-freaking-sane. which means your denial is hollow and your claims of ""context"" are deceptive. she said it.yah, thought as much. the one quote you claim was taken ""out of context"" was, in fact, not taken out of context and meant exactly what people said it did. but you claim that there are a lot of others out that there are also inaccurate you just, um... hey, look over there! so in other words, do not post your quotes if you think they make you look bad, and start admitting that even though you're wrong and refuse to actually cite any evidence, i should ""admit"" that your baseless and so far debunked claims are right. hrm... why does that seem a bit odd?"
5/18/2010,"this is a girl we should all feel sorry for.she tries so hard. being confrontational and rude on the internet forums has thought her she can maintain the sad selfimage she has.but when provoked a bit, her idea of fighting trolls with trolls is to blame a mother for her autistic child.but besides her character and mental stability cleary being in need of serieus help, let's look at her ideas about eve.can anybody put forward an original idea of hers that even remotly makes sence in eve?you can't, you know why? because she does not care about eve.let me repeat that.ankhesmpatalkelal does not care for the game you play.she cares for herself and struggles whith her own world.carebear voters, there are much better and more reasonable candidates out there for you. people who are actually passionate about the game you play."
5/18/2010,"it seems that amongst all the discussion about how to attract more missioners to low sec, no one's really asked them what their take on low sec is and why they do or don't operate there. i'm not talking about opinions from pirates with mission running alts, but from players whose main play style is pve. so, i created a post in missions & complexes to encourage feedback from this new eden demographic.feel free to chime in on that thread with your thoughts."

5/18/2010,"i was commenting from the perspective that your ""publication"" is going out of its way to do this.personally i am not opposed to the forum discussion on ank.looks like an easy target tribune decided to jump on.from a neutral perspective it looks opportunistic.lets see if you take on 'tougher targets' in the future ....thats why i posted. still not making sense ?_______________________________________________________________________________________________ps. razor dude : i guess everyone that disagrees with you is a troll ...."
5/18/2010,"dear stovo,ankh is an ""easy target"", as you put it, because she is so thoroughly, clearly, and totally awful as a csm candidate. and yes, we did go out of our way to do this. we did so because we decided that it was worth doing whatever we could to attempt to convince people that she should not be elected, because we believe she would be awful for the game if she were. we have no intention of taking on ""tougher targets"" in future csm races because by definition a ""tougher target"" would be a better candidate.so according to your reasoning, the tribune was wrong to publish an editorial criticizing ankh because she is so utterly terrible a candidate that doing so was essentially shooting fish in a barrel, and unsporting. but it would have been ok for the tribune to criticize a better candidate, because s/he would have had more of a fair, fighting chance.do you have any idea how dumb this argument makes you look?love,miyaps: your perspective isn't neutral.pps: i'd like to introduce you to my friend, the paragraph. you two really should meet sometime."
5/18/2010,"as we come to the end of csm voting, i would like to encourage everyone to vote. regardless of who gets elected, an increase in the voter turnout makes the csm a stronger and more legitimate voice of player interests.needless to say, i hope you will vote for me. but i would prefer you vote for someone else than not vote at all.best, trebor"
5/18/2010,"while i agree with most of the things you've desired change, as a ecm pilot i highly dissagree with buffing eccm or nerfing ecm, the range nerf was bad enough, range was the only tank avaliable should you be versing hostiles using different ships to the ecm you had fitted.also, none of the other types of e-war are based also on chance, all the others are simply based on your optimal with those modules. in an ecm boat, if you miss a jam on something within range due to bad luck chances are your going to drop if you dont get out of there before being tackled. i had a spree of bad luck like this once, even with only caldari ecm vsing only caldari ships. 2 drakes and a crow, 2 ecm on each and they all missed a cycle. no need to state what happened. rest of the fleet couldn't do anything to summarise the result. and that was based on effective scouting, most jamming ships wont be fitted out like that in a spur of the moment battle.i also do agree with the ecm drones though, they're essentially a get out of jail free card against most frigates due to a lower signal strength, so often have i heard over coms ""ive got him t- nevermind hes away, jammed by drones"" or something along those lines."
5/18/2010,"so what you're saying is that you got really unlucky at one point and died. that's life (though not being able to jam a crow with a racial jammer is a little odd... decent skills give you a 100% of a jam unless he's got eccm). but just because it's possible for a small gang to kill an ecm boat doesn't mean that ecm isn't disproportionately effective compared to other forms of ew. for instance, it's the only type of ew that's really effective against the gang you just described; td are pointless, sds only serve to reduce their targeting down to point range, which doesn't really do anything unless you're in a gang full of lacheses and tps don't do much against shield tanked ships that already have massive signatures. webs are decent against the crow, but a webbed drake can still hit you just fine. also, i have a video of me being jammed 4 consecutive times by a rack of ec-300s in a recon. while the odds of that mathematically are phenomenally low, i believe many will agree with me that it happens a lot more than it should."
5/18/2010,"i, too, am an ecm pilot. the range nerf for rooks/falcons really wasn't a huge nerf in my eyes, namely because i didn't dual-box a falcon on gates. why don't i think it was a big issue? well, the range did go down - but eve as a whole got significantly slower. a vagabond going 11k/sec catches up to a pre-nerf falcon in nine seconds. a 4k/sec vagabond catches up to a post-nerf falcon in fifteen seconds - and that's assuming your sitting still. a falcon can mwd, say, 25% the speed of a vagabond - that's like a pre-nerf falcon mwding at 3k/sec. oh right, and falcons can jam even harder. oh and scorps/blackbirds can still sit at crazy range. so yea, i don't really see the nerf there.and i am fine with ec-300s jamming frigates, honestly i want them to do that. what i take issue with is stuff likethese complaints aren't just the crazy ramblings of unlucky people, it happens. it happens far more than it should, and i'm fairly certain something is wrong. don't get me wrong, it's hilarious: a falcon missed a jam on my drake the other day, and then my ec-300s jammed the falcon."
5/18/2010,"one day left. so if you haven't voted yet, you should do it now."
5/18/2010,thank god this thread has remained clean :)
5/18/2010,wulfnor wants a (free) holiday
5/18/2010,"in my opinion it is time to ""flatten"" the tiers in some ship classes. there are (for example) a handful of generally useful frigates and cruisers, a few which have very niche roles (mining/scanning) then too many ""also rans"" which exist just to be a base for the t2 variation (slasher for example).because it doesn't take much time to train from one tier to the next there isn't really any need to have such a gulf between the terrible and the awesome in a ship class. for instance very few people are going to use any other minmatar frigate than a rifter for longer than it takes them to train frigate 3. i think adding a slot or two along with a bit more pg and/or cpu would make ships like the breacher more viable for long term use.it is good to have variations between ships within class and also between different races, but this should be on a role basis and not simply down to less overall slots and fitting.the ships are already in the game so a few tweaks shouldn't take a large amount of time and it would benefit not only brand new players but also those players taking their first steps into pvp (agony unleashed pvp basic plug )"

5/18/2010,"hello elf lord,i have an answer for you, and a quite solid logical one at that. it's quite self explanatory really: i believe such commentary and attitude are in violation of multiple agreements and would further constitute a negative image when put forth for review by ccp.it is clearly stated in the rules of eligibility that one's conduct is a factor in granting an application, quote:""candidates are expected to be active on the csm forums and participate in the discussion of topics. they are also expected to adhere to the eula/tos and carry themselves in a manner that sets an example for other players to follow.""source:"
5/18/2010,thanks to everyone who's pledging support behind my campaign!if you've been paying attention to the test server development you'll notice that ccp have rationalised the distribution of planets to be more consistent with the laws of physics. so - great news there for the kind of people that care about it.

5/18/2010,"i wasn't even going to vote in this farce. however, i figured if one of the candidates were to run and wanted to ""fix"" the t2 bpo farce (yes there are a lot of these aren't there?) then i'd vote for them.however checking the candidates page and using my browser's ""find"" i can't find one candidate who wishes to get involved in this.too big (curly) an issue?"
5/18/2010,"no, it's probably that most of them don't consider it an issue. like a lot of the rest of the players."
5/18/2010,more of an issue is the number of people that continue to use an apostrophe when pluralizing bpo.
5/18/2010,"there is an issue??ahhh you mean the lottery...i agree, the lottery is unfair.. every day new people are selling their prints through some ""lotto"" on the sell forums, and this is just wrong innit... after all, the winner of those ""lotto"" games should be ashamed, banned, with tar, feathers, and hmmm wow this is sounding fun and kinky.. but yea, back to my original question...there is an issue??"
5/18/2010,you sure like calling things farces.i'd vote for a candidate who is going to tackle threads on the wrong forum.
5/18/2010,"you could vote for cat. i think she is the only active member of the forums that has promised to listen to the community, rather than pushing their own (and alliances) agenda."
5/18/2010,"what forum should it be in? it's a question regarding the csm. i don't see a forum for it. the question isn't about science and industry, it's about the csm candidates.so far, all your posts are farcical.and i for one am allowed to poast when tired and irritated at not finding a decent csm candidate. i'm just surprised it wasn't in caod."
5/18/2010,"no csm has the balls to deal with this issue?i would cast my 2nd vote to that candidate. (asuming voting hasn't ended yet)(there is an issue, if not ccp should go out and dispute community numbers.)removing t2 bpo might not be the solution for the issue though!"
5/18/2010,indeed. i wasn't eluding to the fact that removing the bpo's was the result i was after. i would just like a far broader range of things i can make to sell.
5/18/2010,"this.as far as i can tell, about 90% of the earth's population can't seem to understand how to correctly use apostrophes, which is pretty sad."
5/18/2010,"""jita park speakers cornera less formal venue to discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar management.""also why vote cat?...he trolls the fourms is the only reason u know about him, then untrolled and elected to join csm....""peons"" comes to mind...../rant"
5/18/2010,the topic of t2 bpos is on the top of my things to discuss if i get in - so i guess that would be me your looking to vote for.

5/19/2010,i bet 50 mil that ccp is not going to fix it with tyrannis. makes me wonder why there is a csm since this problem has been disscussed in iceland for over 2 times now.
5/19/2010,i would love to have a reason to fly my afs in pvp
5/19/2010,supported
5/19/2010,"i'd prefer to see a role bonus as opposed to a 4th. not all interceptors get 4 bonuses either. each frigate class shiptype is tailored around the original hulls. they also come standard with extra resistances (some of the highest in the game) and extra high slot hardpoints. this makes them quite a match against other ships in its class, and i'm sure many a cruiser and battlecruiser has been lost to a skilled pilot in an af. if you're dying in afs you need to learn how to shoot drones (and dare i say it?!?) learn to stay out of web range. the comments about blaster enyos is silly, they're far too slow for anything like that. blaster ishkur sounds more reasonable, but again when you're inside the 10km range anything goes! that being said, lets give them something else, like a 25% increase in capacitor rate to make up for all those flashy modules which require tons of capacitor in relation to how much afs start out with standard. that way they'll have a spitting chance at running active tanking modules, as well as the reps/boosters/guns/ab/mwd <--you get the picture. just my two isks."
5/19/2010,i am guessing your talking about the taranis which instead of putting two separate +5% to small hybrid bonuses they combined it to one 10% per level?
5/19/2010,"like all ""hybrids need love"" issues, supported."
5/19/2010,"semantically, more a fix than love, supported."
5/19/2010,either blasters need love or blaster boats need unreasonably high native resists.
5/19/2010,"eft dps of blasters is fine. the main problem is to apply that dps.look at classes in fantasy universe. there are archer, rogue, tank and other. every class has balance. tank has low dps and high defence. tank can do low damage long time due to defence.archer makes medium damage at long range. his tank is his speed.rogue (dagger) has high dps but very short range. he should has something to apply his high dps: speed, evasion or other tricks. otherwise rogue will die without inflicting damage to target.so i hope you see some parallels. caldari has range, minmatar can kite (barrage + tc or te = good range), amarr has good buffer tank and good dps (with scorch they have long range and still good dps ) gallente has the shortest range and slightly bigger paper dps. they have no speed advantage (hull is not the fastest + armor rigs reduce original speed and agility) they have no tank advantage: active tanking is not good with cap eating weapon, buffer armor tank is not so good as amarr (little low slots, no armor resist bonuses, waste of active tank bonuses). shield tank works but it works better on shield ships.gallente should be fixed.simple solution: increase damage bonus for gallente ships from 5% to 7.5% per level. slightly increase base tracking speed of blasters.complicated solution: total strategy change for gallente ships. base speed increasing, signature decreasing, special bonuses like stasis web speed factor or other - i do not know. but it is difficult becouse it interferes with other eve ships and items."
5/19/2010,"hybrids definitely don't deliver the goods. railguns are inaccurate and do very little damage. statistically they are inferior to everything else, but in actual gameplay they seem even worse that the numbers suggest. blasters aren't much better - their supposed to be the highest dps turret yet everyone knows autocannons far outdamage them and hit more often. of course the biggest imbalance in the game are caldari missile ships that never miss, can do every kind of damage and deliver just as much dps as the best turrets..all without any of that falloff or optimal range nonsense (oh and they can't be neuted or disrupted). meanwhile, between their inefficient armor tanking, weak drones and terrible guns, gallente are worthless."
5/19/2010,support
5/19/2010,supported. though it'd be better for a lot of rework of lacking railboats than rails themselves.
5/19/2010,"supported, and muchly needed"
5/19/2010,"many broken things in industry that would need to be redesigned and fixed before this would become possible.i believe it was intended but then a structure was used without foresight, which locked out most of the future possibilities and hamstrung industry."
5/19/2010,"supported for me/pe that doesn't require physical access to the pos (similar to alliance).as far as having someone lock up all your me/pe slots and cancelling the job is concerned, this is actually a money spinner. all your labs are rented! that's exactly what you want. even better, if all the jobs are cancelled, you simply repackage the lab and open them up again - you get paid double. you get the isk they put into the jobs the first time - there are no refunds if you cancel - and you get to rent the labs out a second time. even if they got smart and kept one active job in the lab - it's still fully rented which was what i wanted in the first place.cancel as many jobs as you like, i'll happily repackage the lab if you've cancelled all of your jobs and then i'll re-rent the lab slots. (meanwhile the labs that are not publicly rented are churning out my personal research for free)."
5/19/2010,"i may be wrong but it seems this is at the heart of the problem. without the factory manager role and the ability to cancel *all* corp jobs,a user does not seem to have the ability to cancel their own jobs as a result of the database structure used. once a user loses factory manager they are unable to cancel their own jobs for corp. it would appear this wasn't foreseen and may have been broken when installations had queues added.a redesign of the core of industry will likely result in all these issues being easier to fix."

5/19/2010,"personally i love the idea, but here are two big red flags that have to be considered in the problem solving equation:1. cost anaylsis - x solution has to be something of a cost effective approach.2. game play - x solution should not be changing existing game mechanics.in terms of cost analysis, any resources that get allocated to problem solving and on-going support will be sucked away from other budgets. in terms of game play, in my discussions most legitimate miners would prefer that changes in existing game play should not be on the table. its also my personal preference as well, because when you change mining mechanics you have to change them across the board and im of the opinion that there is enough for a miner to do in null sec when mining, dealing with rats and also keeping an eye in local for neuts or wts all at the same time. that being saidwhere i have concern on this one is the ongoing costs basis of your proposed solution, as a business manager i look at development costs in both options but in terms of customer support, how many support tickets are going to be created as banned accounts protest? well i will need to treat them equally as i treat all support tickets because we may have made a mistake. now we look at the following scenario (a) im having to staff additional bodies to cover this on-going support or (b) im going to let support levels fall. the macro/bot monitoring option provides for a much lower level of support. where an account gets banned, they get a termination notice that says sorry, your account has been banned as a macro, specifically weve found xyz macro software running while your eve client was running, youve violated the eula and your account is terminated. i mean lets be real here, ccp targets a commercially available bot software specifically marketed for eve, you will get 90% of the bots out of the game. those who write their own or use macro software designed for other programs, im sure they will slide by but this method clears out most of the cheaters with a lowest cost approach.its sort of a we think you have your hand in the cookie jar in comparison to we know you have you hand in the cookie jar for lack of a better i havent finished my first cup of coffee analogy.again, the idea you propose is one i really like, but it just doesnt fly from a business/cost perspective. its great way to do a one-sweep, but as an ongoing management tool i think its too expensive.java"
5/19/2010,"i think you missed the point about what macro miner is.the whole point of macro mining is that you do not have to be anywhere your pc. you say all they need to do is a do is a sound warning, that implies that the person is by their machine 24/7 which negates the point of macro mining.if i was going to macro mine, i would simply install eve on my laptop (no i don't play on my laptop but with a laptop i can leave running 24/7 without the wife shouting at me ) create the macro in one of the many macro software tools which are on general sale for <U+FFFD>15 - 30 dollars, setup a dozen different patterns to different asteroids fields, start it, close the lid on my laptop and walk away.once day i would check on it, start a different pattern and walk away.by doing this it makes it much more difficult for players to spot that i'm a macro miner as i am not in the same spot over and over again so the chances of me being reported are very low.by using the method suggested, (i would also make the pop up appear at random time intervals as well) i wouldn't be able to do this as i would constantly have to monitor it as a macro would not work.as for those who are actually mining for real, all they would have to do is every x minutes is press a button, how is that annoying?would this do anything about macro ratting and macro spam bots, maybe not, but the question to ask is what makes the rmt companies more money and how big a hit would they take if they were no longer able to macro mine?p.sno i do not macro mine and neither do i support it in anyway shape or form. p.s.sseriously i don't"
5/19/2010,"java buddy glad you relaxed on your last post thought i lost you to the stupidity of some people lol. and ranka my dear most macro miners either a.) are rmt. b.) are alt accounts that support a pvp main and there is no doubt in my mind that macro miners contribute as a majority of the plex purchases so they really aren't spending any money to play the game. also to help you all understand java's outburst.with things type liked ""no no no ccp has zero right to install that software on my system"". you are absolutely correct they have no right to ""install"" things on ""your system"". but you have to understand that people have no right to ""violate"" the eula nor do they have the right to make real money of a game created and ""copy righted"" by another individual or company. also ccp does have the ""right to protect"" they're assets by giving the ""option"" to the end-user to either accept the eula and its protection software or don't play. as for ccp dying off with the implementation of this java can prolly work the numbers better then i could but last time i looked into it it was something like 15 million usd to develope an mmo and about 5 million a year to keep it running. with what is it now 300,000 subscribers in eve or something like that at 17.49 usd per month per or 10.49 per month if you pay by the year per subscriber they would have to loose something around 250,000+ subscribers for them to have any kinda hurt you have to understand online gaming namely pay to play online gaming is ""extremely"" profitable. which is why the games that are ""free"" online games survive so well with sponsors etc. also i almost forgot to add in there, there are a few of us that possess a life time account which we never have to pay on again. but that number isn't over 10,000 subscribers. being that they didn't offer it for that long.hold on gotta site my work below or people will freak lola game time card is 60 days or 2 plex at 34.99 = 17.49 per monthyear subscription is 12 months for 131.40 = 10.49 per monthlast press release on user accounts from eve online is here 300,000 subscribersi wouldn't doubt that the 300,000 has grown being, that number is from may 09. by the way for those obsessed with numbers 300,000 subscribers paying the rock bottom price of 10.49 per month still comes out to 3,147,000. thats alot of money in one month but you have to take taxes etc. from it which would prolly drop that to around 1.5 million a month. so again all you people saying ""i'll leave the game"" if i was ccp i'd be rolling in my chair laughing. in the end its up to ccp on what they want to really do. either way they go they will loose subscribers and gain subscribers the question is do they want fake subscribers that when the game dies it ""really"" dies meaning everyone just drops because a majority of the subscribers are rmt or do they want it to die off slowly with a majority of the subscribers being real players? also a game that has a majority of real players tends to last longer then rmt players and or having players that cheat on the game."
5/19/2010,"also the other question that needs to be asked is if you were to take macro miners our of the game, what would this do to the market.if say only 5% of ore is produced by macro miners then the effect wouldn't be that bad, however if say the percentage of ore was more like 30% then that would have a massive effect on the market. so those that just say ""ban them all"" it isn't that simple. if the number was large then you would have to do it on a gradually so to lessen the effect on the market.after all just imagine if 30% of the ore being mined in game suddenly just disappeared?also the argument that ccp are not bothered about macro miners because of the money they generate via subs is utter nonsense.how much money do think ccp are losing because people are buying isk via gold sellers and not plex's off ccp?the price for 2x plexes are 34.99 / <U+FFFD>30 / $43 - at the moment looking at eve market the cheapest are 300 million.so for 34.99/ <U+FFFD>30 / $43 you can get 600 million isk.via a gold selling site you can 1.3 million isk for 39 / <U+FFFD>38 / $48so for a few more pounds / euro's / dollars you can get more then twice the isk via gold selling sites. so while macro miners are in the game and generating the level of isk that allows the gold sellers to sell twice the amount of isk then you can buy legit, it will hurt ccp.ccp wants rid of these people as much as we do."
5/19/2010,"i just started mining and you can usually tell who is macro mining and who is not. i don't know the solution to this but it annoys me that it exists because i am waisting my time - as the ore i sell is cheaper than a macro miners ore they sell.they will always have an upper hand of having available isk to them.lets say macro mining was 100% abolished. i think this would improve the game i beleive, as ore prices would rise, more people would probably 'steal' ore from us miners, and therefore more war-decs would probably occure too. but at least the ore i mine would be comparable to some mission items i get that i can 'sell' for millions.im just a newbie player though...cheers'"
5/19/2010,usually if lessons are unfair you ca get the instructor fired. can we do that to eve people?
5/19/2010,no!you might as well scrap the game altogether if proposals like this are allowed to fly.or have i been trolled again? seems likely.
5/19/2010,"i support this topic. for it, even the ieee and icc (international color consortium) in real world activities is ultimately funded by corporation membership. while a company does not need to adhere to such organizations, it is founded to be more damaging to them than proactive if not. why, in this game we would make an exception is to only constitute greed or fear. change is what makes this game fun, and change is what should be welcomed."
5/19/2010,will be fun to see a missionrunner and professional salvager have salvage drone wars. makes it harder on professional salvagers if they come on a domi or anything drone-boat. whip out the salv drones! hah awesome idea.
5/19/2010,"salvage drones are hidden away in the database somewhere, or at least the skill to use them is in there.i think it would be a bonus to mission runners and ratters. at least you could salvage the nice big juicy wrecks during the mission.if both the ninja salvagers and the mission runner had access to salvage drones, then there's no change in the current balance. i see vexors and myrmidons becoming the new salvage boats of choice, while the destroyers and other bcs take a back seat. while the battleships would field a flight of salvage drones to clean the choice wrecks during the mission.edit: added my thumbs up."
5/19/2010,"i'm against this. a salvager costs the ship it's fitted to quite a bit (cpu, high slot, 5 km range, etc). having it just as a drone would be overpowered, even if the drone was 25 m3 (a dominix would be uber in this case).it's been suggested before, and shot down. not supported, as it would be nigh impossible to balance the costs into a decent drone."
5/19/2010,"only way to make this happend is by making the drones 25m3 and so slow, that even an amarr bs coulb outrun the drones. the salvaging itself should have cycletime of 10sec-20sec and 1/5 of the succes a module have (t1 drones compared to t1 module, t2 to t2), so that one single module is as good as full fleet of drones.i do not agree anyhow with this. it would have some advantages, but also it would make the salvaging too profitable profession if 5m3 drones could do the salvage."
5/19/2010,how about tractor beam drones that you can send out to gather the wrecks. you target a wreck and the drones go fetch it for you and bring it close enough to salvage. that would save some of the salvage time without unbalancing anything.i support salvage drones and tractor beam drones. both seem like helpful non-combat items and would add versatility to most ships.
5/19/2010,"salvaging drones could easily work. they could be similar to that of mining drones having a couple different types. for example you could have a standard tech 1 which is say 10m3 that can't salvage anything bigger then a medium wreck and your salvage percentage is based on your salvaging drone skill. then you could have the big one say the 25m3 that can salvage anything and everything but is slow. also you could have a tech ii 10m3 that could do the same thing as the big one but requires a tier 2 skill trained as well as say salvaging drone skill level 5 say. in the end you would need something cruiser class or bigger to salvage with drones. it would actually slow some people down being that each time a drone salvaged it would have to return back to your ship much like a mining drone. as for a drone boat mission fit being ""ubber"" lol not really because they would have to pull they're drones in and send out they're salvage drones potentially making the mission take longer being that they wouldn't have that extra combat drone(s) out doing damage. it would speed up a few things but you also have to remember you can only launch 5 drones max unless your in a carrier or super carrier.gonna support this one"
5/19/2010,"i figure that most serious salvagers use a destroyer to clear up after their mission, and since the only destroyer that has any drone space is the catalyst, and that's only got 5m3 then i don't think they'll be a right lot of use.now i'd love to see t2 tractor beams, 30km range and a slightly faster pull, say about 700m/s or so, but i doubt they'll ever happen since all the anti-carebears will winge."
5/19/2010,"if salvage belongs to no one, then neither should salvage drones. if someone sends out their salvage drones i should have the right to shoot them down without any aggro or concord penalties. they should be heavy drones, top speed of 150 m/s, not be affected by drone navigation computers or drone navigation skill, a full rack have the same chance as a single t1 salvager with salvage skill lvl 1 to gain salvage, and have to return to the launching ship to deposit salvage. they should require drones 5 and heavy drone operation 4. any salvage drones claim would have to be destroyed when they are, no loot drops from destroyed salvage drones. the base cost on them should be over 2 mil isk each. with these stipulations they would have enough drawbacks that no one would bother using them because they suck, and ccp can still say ""ok we put them in now shut up about it already, we'll fix them soon(tm)."" they'd be about as useless as all the other drones that nobody ever uses and no one complains about being broken."
5/19/2010,voting against. this is a boost to missioning. allowing bss to solo lvl 4s and then quickly mop up salvage with drones without sacrificing highslots to salvagers.
5/19/2010,supported.there's a lot more that can (needs to) be done with the corp interface and roles - like being able to grant a role that allows you to grant other roles - hierarchical roles (besides the directors - who are the only people who can grant roles now). e.g. specify which roles can grant each title.....but i'm de-railing so i'll stop now.i suspect eve-gate might make some of that functionality easier to implement.this at least is one step in the right direction.
5/19/2010,"this kinda stuff really helps with managing the workload within corps and alliances.-i know this isn't quite the place, but does anyone have a link to the thread about allowing jb fuelling by standings rather then by alliance-only? i want to support that too."

5/19/2010,supported. go xious!
5/19/2010,"i have had the horrible experience of fighting 2 major 0.0 sov wars since dominion. i think the jury verdict has become quite clear on the fact that dominion is worse than pos warfare. but i think that the basic idea is fine, so long as some simple changes are made:1) reduce all station hp: shields by 50%, armor reduced by 75%, and upgrade resistances to reflect similar hp. the only thing worse than shooting these things atm is repairing them. neither side wants to sit there for hours on end repairing them when they already have to spend hours repairing other lame things like pos. repairing does not generate fun... it hardly ever even provokes a fight. so quit wasting our time.2) reduce i-hub timers to 1 day max, reduce station timers to 1.5 days max. this means the current system of 6 days is reduced down to 3 days for a station system. this means way less camping, and less options for staggering timers in multiple systems.3) fix titans. as predicted, it's really becoming wars about who has the most super capitals, and even worse who has the most titans. proliferation is at a ridiculous high for supers and it's only going to get worse. the only counter has been proven to be other supers. atlas tried the gank a titan experience under the most promising of circumstances, they had a leviathan at point blank with 0 cap and 0 hardeners activated. their 60 capitals never got it below 50% shields before they lost too much firepower and his hardeners were able to activate/reps kicked in. fix the dd so that dreads in siege have a defensive advantage against them that does not allow titans to be the i win of fights.4) cyno jammers are still a joke. it's way too easy to get a new one online. when a cyno jammer dies, prevent it from being killed and replaced, force it to be repaired.5) pos orbiting tactics are a joke. i've said this for 3 years now that it's a bad concept to have in game and an even worse concept now with super capitals. everyone knows it not a full proof tactic, but it is a very weighted tactic for the tower defender. this is bad considering they already have a massive advantage with the tower guns/ecm/mods. 6) slow bomber rof down. 1 minute 50 second reload with max skills is way to fast to make a new bombing run. either cut down the cargo capacity so they cannot do this as often w/o restocking, or cut down the rof to at least 5 minutes. nothing else needs to change, but allow at least some chance of actually having a fight w/o needing to warp. until you can do formation warping that doesn't stack a fleet spread across 200km on a 5km sphere when landing, bombers will continue to be overpowered. also cyno landing spots need to be a 20km radius, not the current 5km. 6) change sbu's to a 1 hr anchoring/onlining time. create a module for the defenders to use to disrupt sbu's after a 3 hr onlining span that cost 2x the cost of an sbu. force more fights to occur during the wait time for i-hubs and stations to come out of reinforced. there's just not enough potential for fights atm. similar to repairing stations, nobody in their right mind wants to wait 3 hours to defend an onlining sbu knowing that even after it's online, they then have to chew through an ass load of hp on a station and i-hub just to reinforce them. in particular, this hurts smaller organizations who already have a prolonged period of attack on the station/hub b/c they are smaller. those are probably the 6 most pressing issues with 0.0 sov."
5/19/2010,"why yes, i do agree defenders dont already have enough advantages, they urgently need another.(disclaimer: no i dont)"
5/19/2010,i think the bombers are fine as anti blob measurement. especially as a smart fleet can easily avoid much damage with spreading out. we dont need to make it easier for the closely hugging blob again.
5/19/2010,"didn't you post a month ago that you've never run bombers and therefore can't be too sure? there are very limited options for warping a fleet in and spreading out before bombs can hit. they're not good options, they're just all the game currently offers. either that needs to change, or bomb launch times need to change. lol initiative guy talking about repairing stations as an advantage to the defender. obviously you've never had to do this, particularly in the buggy armor state. nobody wants to spend 3-4 hours of their life repairing a station. that's not an advantage for either side, that's just bad game mechanics. the game should not promote something so dull that it drives people away from the game."
5/19/2010,"it was torothanax, who wanted educate us on bombers although he never used them."
5/19/2010,"caod -> that way. keep your smacktalk in there please.if you want hubs and stations to have fewer hitpoints, that's fine by me. but there's absolutely no excuse to make it even easier for the defender to ignore the first few fights and only turn up for the last one. there are few enough penalties for the defender losing or not defending as it is."
5/19/2010,"this is one thing i can't agree with. if the attacker brings out the effort to do damage to it, you should have to put effort into repairing it.i do agree with 2, 3, 4 and 5, though. i can't agree with 6 because i believe bombers are balanced as is already (a normal bomber can only stock four bombs at a time)."
5/19/2010,"you're pigeon holing stations by saying it must take the same amount of time to repair as it does to siege... but it currently doesn't. armor triage is a very limited use tool which is why it's so unlikey most pilots have it. compared to dreads, which have a variety of functions for use, including combat, sieging towers, sieging stations, etc, and you realize the imbalance. most carrier pilots spend a lot of time training for shield triage, b/c for years, that's been what's important. for the most part, that still is what's important. 50 dreads can nearly 1 cycle a station's armor... 10 minutes. 10 triage armor carriers with max skills and a gang bonus can't even repair it in 40 minutes. since a triage carrier with 4 reps is about equal to 16 normal carriers, you can virtually write off normal carriers repairing it. honestly, i could do without the resistances too, but problem with that is the suicide effect similar to what was happening with sbu's. and speaking of which, original post updated to include change to sbu."
5/19/2010,uhm ... armor triage? did i miss anything? i always thought the triage module affects both equally ... and i am pretty sure that almost every carrier pilot has capital remote armor reps trained aswell. as 3 out of 4 carriers are usually armor tanked. also repping armor of pos modules ....but please correct me when i am wrong.
5/19/2010,might want to break out specific ideas and into sepearate threads so each one can be addressed separately. this could turn into a very long thread with varying comments where it's going to be hard to follow specific subject matter people would want to vote on.just my 0.02isk.
5/19/2010,"you are correct.the op is comparing two things that aren't equal: 50 dreads v 10 carriersit doesn't take much to see why 10 carriers wouldn't be on par with 50 dreads.edit: as someone who has shot too many poss, i like the new sov mechanic better than the old one. i don't like the lag. i still don't like poss. as poss remain the passive income source for alliances (as well as the location to jump fleets in and safe fleets up), they remain the primary target of alliance fleets. sov warfare is better, but still needs work."
5/19/2010,"ok then i have a number question for the op:if 50 sieged dreads need about 1 siege cycle to reinforce a station, how long would it take them without siege?andif 10 triage carrier need 40minutes to rep armor of the station back up, how long would it take 50 triage carriers to rep it back up?because imho that are the numbers you should compare.and yes i think ccp was expecting to see fights when the defender try to repair the station. didnt work out it seems. i think not a single region fell so far where the defenders were really fighting back. it was either wallet issues or the defender retreating.maybe a system similar to taking systems in fw would help the whole blob warfare. or having the carebear system indeces affecting the system security level... that way you could break sov levels with roaming gangs ... that way you might see sov level 4 dropping because there wasnt enough mining/ratting and you loose your cyno jammer.shooting structures for sov is utterly boring."
5/19/2010,"so 50 dreads kill it in 10 minutes, and 50 triage carriers rep it in 8. in other words, what you're saying is that if you have gangs of equal size, the carriers rep faster than the dreads dps. and you think the carriers need the buff here."
5/19/2010,"no, i'm stating what is practical to expect in a large fleet in todays eve. yes you can triage either armor or shields if you have both trained... most pilots do not. either requires the prerequisite of remote armor or remote shields to 5. whether there's logic or not for why people do or don't have it, it's just a fact that most will not train armor triage.this game is not made based on the what ifs, it's based on the practical nature of humans. nobody is going to train armor triage just for the rare instance that they have to repair a station or i-hub. 90% of 0.0 now has absolutely no reason to train armor triage b/c stations are not threatened. however, pos are threatened everywhere, every day. hence the high likelihood of shield triage pilots.can that change in the future, absolutely, but unlikely. something you guys also fail to consider: carriers are the only practical way to repair a station/hub. every ship in the game including carriers are practical for reinforcing them. so how is that balanced?"
5/19/2010,could you *please* fix your terminology... there is no armor triage or shield triage skill.and your argument is still largely flawed as for fleet fights most people armor tank their carrier. also the armor tanked titans and motherships are seen very often.so i am very very sure that most carrier pilots will have capital remote armor rep skills or atleast you will find as many carrier pilots with remote armor repair skills as you will find with remote shield transfer skills.so please fix your terminology and try to find a better argument.thanks in advance.
5/19/2010,"you don't train armor and triage skills for repping stations, you train them for repping ships. i hear a lot of ships armor tank."
5/19/2010,"umm - seeing how much they get camped now, while attached to a pos, makes me doubt this idea.jb's are the home teams personal trainline, and they are one of the few defenders advantages while fighting on home soil.i do want someone to get them to fix the standings issue, where you have to get someone from the alliance that owns the pos to dump fuel in, instead of letting blues to it...that can get real irritating, and its unfair to the alliance who own it. people should carry ozone with them and pay their own way"
5/19/2010,"at least they did a low-sec event nextdoor to me so i could pick off stragglers.tons of fw people were doing it, then adhd came in, etc, fun stuff. wasn't online to watch the whole sha-bang but it was nice and chaotic."

5/19/2010,"as written, this suggestion is senseless. i could agree with using a special type of server object that shows up as 0 points on a killboard (hint: kills of concord battleships are showing up as zero points already).the killmail is like that spoon from disneyland that you've had since you were 5 or that shot glass from the mall of america or the t-shirt from your first concert. they're trinkets to show you went to the event. many of the comments are worse than senseless; these events are not about ""carebears"" or pvpers or rpers -- they're about expanding the storyline of new eden. these are for all of us. if you don't want to go, fine. if you want to go, great.these events are as much about pvp as anything else -- in low-sec, the remnants of the battle usually turn on each other (except when an overwhelming force from one faction or another is on the field)."

5/19/2010,"datacores only yield ~10m/month? then what the hell is all the fuzz about.that is 30m for an account, 360m per year .. so once a year you can buy a plex or pay rl money, do some shuffling around and let account go dead again with no actual profit made .. seems like a pretty poor deal to me (which just happens to be why i sold my research account by the by).moons, and soon planets, provide income that is entirely ingame with no rl ties at all so after the setup is paid it is all profit. null planets will be absurd printing presses as they cannot be destroyed like pos and are under the umbrella of a bazillion capitals.low/high planets also cannot be destroyed and the umbrella may extend to some, but yields are scaled so low that some will probably never get into the black once null-sec starts flooding markets with their gunk, that is before factoring in the much higher random neutral traffic most of which is more than happy to gank a hauler or two.- [non negotiable!] space needs to be able to impact pi operations. destroy some structures that must then be repaired (ie. no added cost), purely a time sink but time = isk. gives small strike teams something to do in null-, low- and high-sec.- scaling between low-/null-sec needs to be a lot more even. allowing null the advantage of being able to sell products below the price that low-sec pays to produce same and still make a huge profit is just stupid. competition will be non-existent except between the null power-blocs and they will probably create some nefarious cartel - failing the scaling part, give low-sec planets a monopoly on some or all of the high-end processes so that even null-sec has to go/haul there for complete chains or sell on markets letting low-sec do the work with a profit."

5/19/2010,please. i've been wanting this change from the moment i stepped into a logistics ship and realized that i can't even support my pirate friends when they duel each other without a 15 minute face-slap.
5/19/2010,"no.from the op in the ot.if you do not want this problem make sure you don't have pirates in your fleet. stop flying with boneheads that pod people ""for the squish"" without regard to their standings.stop flying with people that can't take 30 seconds to pop a rat as they are wandering.negative status is not suppose to be easy. there is no reason to make it easier when the fixes for the problem are already there.i thought this would be a thread about the neutral logistics's during high sec wars, which is a problem. instead it is a pirate whine, ""i want to be bad but i should not have to pay for it."".i personally giggle when i see a solo red in a gang in low sec. never had a single one ever get away. lots of tasty 2t kills because some lazy pirate can't keep their sec status under control.btw, i have flown with red flashy's in fleet. if i am fcing... it is their problem. still i have flown with a red flashy as fc. i like flying with them as fc but, i never will do it again if they are red flashy.tl;dr no problem, working as intended."
5/19/2010,"i do not mind taking a gcc when i or my friends are being bad. but if neither i nor my friends are being bad, then i should not take a gcc. i should not take a gcc when missioning or plexing for example."
5/19/2010,"if your sec status has dropped below -5, the consequences should to be extended beyond encounters you engage in, so gcc for repping someone with bad standing? sounds fair to me."
5/19/2010,supported
5/19/2010,"a forum of this size with no way to search it seems ridiculous. a configurable search would almost certainly cut way down on the number of new topics since people could find and join existing threads. imagine if you could find stuff using google-like searches, or search by poster, date, etc. i don't know of another major forum lacking these basic functions. ps: if there already is a search feature, i sure as heck can't find it!"
5/19/2010,there is a search box on the upper right corner.but i prefer
5/19/2010,chribba already did it. it's linked in the post above. ccp can save the development time and use their developers for more useful things as long as chribba's around (or they could just buy chribba's code if/when he no longer wants it).
5/19/2010,"also, they are already working non a redesign of the forums that will follow the release of eve gate. my hope would be that they address this at the same time - along with the host of other features these forums are lacking.frankly it would be better if they took an off the shelf forum package and simply wrapped it in custom css."
5/19/2010,"ahh yes- ganking...but also regular stuff too.if you are the ""instigator"" - ( lets say you can flip )... then if you get killed during the aggression countdown, then i was saying - your insurance should not pay out. you 'started' the fight and lost.cheers'"
5/19/2010,what good purpose would this serve?
5/19/2010,"how about we get some mods that increase damage of drones, we get mods that increase damage of everything else.gallente are already weak thanks to blasters being ****, so why not have some hi slot modules that increase drone damage.like a generic t2 drone damage increase would increase drone damage but these modules would have to be activated and ofc use cap.there will be small / medium / large and capital, any ship can use it but drone boats would really only benefit, lets say they have the cpu / powergrid equivilent of guns / launchers (to prevent abuse).i for one would prefer to have my drones do the damage rather than me."
5/19/2010,"the ships that will significantly benefit from this module are:dominix, rattlesnake, giladominix is already powerful, mainstream small gang pvp ship. it can deal very high damage with full blaster set, or have so-so dps but have full rack of neuts, making it very deadly to anything without a passive tank.rattlesnake and gila are faction ships, so it is ok for them to be overpowered, to some extent. this ships are drone ships, like the dominix, only they have shield tanks, so their low slots are available for full stack of damage mods.while it would be really fun to fly those with drone damage mods, i fear that it is a bit unbalanced due to the fact that these ships will field high tank and high gank setups with all high slots free. perhaps you you agreed to take 2 high slots away from every drone boat, it would justify ability to fit drone damage mods. but people won't stand for such changes."
5/19/2010,"actually, now that i think about it. it would be fair if drone damage mods were high slot, and offer about 15% more damage as opposed to 22% with other mods"
5/19/2010,"i should add, the mods will do damage to drones of its size with the exception of the current drone boats, like ishtar / domi"
5/19/2010,yes please
5/19/2010,i'm getting tired of people trolling every damn thread i make. especially when i do a balancing one in assembly hall. better moderation would be much appreciated.supporting!
5/19/2010,the irony is killing me
5/19/2010,"supported, however i would like to say, those who act in a way to demean, belittle or berate a poster should also see the same treatment.the collective is to discuss possible ideas and solutions to in game problems. there's no need for some of the things that are said to other people just because they disagree.so that's just a pipedream i know. but how about we plan on them being both lazy and rude and give them an option to just vote no on an item?"
5/19/2010,supporting a catclone post.im guessing emo or musical troll has posted something in the past 3 days that was lolable
5/19/2010,lol
5/19/2010,"i am strongly against over-regulation! that said, i must support the proper use of moderation in order to maintain the function and usability of this forum. call the troll on it... and if their response(s) doesn't show they are serious about their (question/issue/proposal) then temp- or perma-ban their character from this forum. a little banter is no problem to anyone. trolling is... besides being just plain annoying. so moderators... let's please have some effective moderation here."
5/19/2010,"trolls aren't just in the assembly hall, they're all over the forums. not even isd seem to be capable of telling the difference anymore, as the recent article on pl's fist formations or whatever, has indicated.so i'm signing this, but only as a first step. trolls will troll for as long as they can get away with it, so simply put, they shouldn't be getting away with it. the only answer is more moderation, but not just in assembly hall, but across all of eve-o./ben"
5/19/2010,"how about this idea: we can turn off sun/nebula flare effects. its driving me insane!! i can't see my controls or the hud half the time and frankly it hurts my eyes after a while. even if i had to reboot the client to change this, i'd do it happily."
5/19/2010,"yep, so do most pvp gamers. they behave exactly the same, fighting and trolling carebear threads, insulting offending and flaming people, who play the game in a different way.do you speak again about the majority of pvp kids out there? i mean have you seen and looked at some of the pvp threads? about the ideas from the hardcore pirates what to do with empire and miners?so you talk about those guys? cuz what you wrote here, perfectly fits to griefers and gankers.like? like this guy here:"
5/19/2010,"ank. after reviewing (most) of the candidates for this seasons csm. i was looking for professionalism in their presentation, and 'evidence' that the qualifications are present for such a role for csm. i may not have agreed with your rp terms in the past, and much of the (ingame) quarrels that were stirred. however, i recognize that this is not a role playing event for csm. so. due to your professional ability to present your campaign, your background and career (irl). i have decided that you get my vote. though small, i hope other readers take notice of the same that i have. --- btw, loved the background action (ships flying by) in your video interview."
5/19/2010,"they don't try to hurt people by blaming them for their autistic child.no it doesn't at all. and that you are not able to see that means that you are either yet again ankh or indeed only 30 days in the game.the main point is that ank does not understand eve, does not even like it. how can you expect a person who does not feel passionate about the game do a good job as csm member?issler dainze"
5/19/2010,because clearly !ankh -> corbeau
5/19/2010,"yes, but do they then expect to be elected to the csm?"
5/19/2010,"yes, they do:"
5/19/2010,"ankh is the greatest eve player in history. think about it. the point of eve is to achieve whatever you set out to do, make a net profit in the process, and crush those who oppose you. ankh is merely doing it on the meta level; she has set out to castrate eve, this whole talk about trying to get ""faek work experience on cv!!!one"" shows possible indirect profit angle, and if she succeeds she will destroy the game for all those she dislikes.she uses tear-laden carebears and other hello kitty refugees the way 0.0 alliance leaders use their drones. she social engineers with the best of them (just look at this thread and her campaign). and she mad. the quintessential eve player.i didn't vote for her, because despite the massive trolling potential, she is so nuts and anti-eve that you'd have to be profoundly handicapped to actually do so, but i will certainly applaud her if she ever succeeds in the task she has set herself."
5/19/2010,"in much the same manner as jita scammers spam mails to people in station ankh has been doing the same in motsu.here's a mail i recieved just before downtime. so the gist of the message is ""0.0 sucks, but it's ok, my alliance isn't a powerblock! we don't hate you like they do. look here's a video. don't want to watch it? then vote for me anyway.""tldr: i'm leaving eve to play puzzle pirates and need a csm vote to put on my cv! send me a vote and i will send you 6 back!"
5/19/2010,in short: ankh is the greatest goon?
5/19/2010,she surpasses even karttoon \o/ all hail eva! o/
5/19/2010,name a carebear thread that isn't 'nerf pvpers so i don't lose spaceships'. you are not morally superior just because you're afraid of losing your spaceship. get over yourself. although i see where ankh gets her supporters from.
5/19/2010,"at least that's a step in the right direction. you acknowledge that there is a playerbase that supports ank. till now ""ank alt!!!!1!!!"" was screamed nearly every time someone said something that could even remotely be interpreted as support for her. now all you have to do is convince that playerbase that getting ganked is actually good for them. good luck with that."
5/19/2010,"yeah, of course there are a lot of helpless people who support the candidate that can make sure they don't have to use their brains. funny thing, i've never been ganked in all my years of eve. i must have superpowers or something... (or i take responsibility for my own safety, rather than crying for the devs to do it for me. ) you are still an ankh alt."
5/19/2010,"true, most ganks can be avoided. i never got ganked in hi sec in the years that i play, and i did not need superpowers for that either. you are still a whining troll."
5/19/2010,and yet you think the people who do get ganked shouldn't be held accountable? you think they should get a free ride and a hug just for signing on? 'cause that's pretty much ankh's platform. she's even mentioned banning people for ganking as a good example of a justice system.
5/19/2010,"rofl! yes, let's hold the victims of crimes accountable for being victims! ""she deserved to get ****d cuz she did not fit a proper tank your honor!""you're a real piece of work buddy and on the banning, that's never going to happen and ank even said herself that such a system was not for eve."
5/19/2010,"this is a video game. i'm not sure if you noticed. comparing getting a pixel spaceship blown up to a real crime is nonsense. it's not against the rules to shoot people, only against the laws, which are designed to be broken. (yes, if ccp wanted no pvp in empire, they'd simply make it impossible to do.) you're also assuming this is a world where something other than your own choices effects your circumstances. so, yes. yes it is the victims fault. it's less ""person ****d"" and more ""person wanders into warzone, gets shot"". they knew the risks going in. ...and the way eve is designed, it's impossible to get ganked unless you're stupid / putting yourself in a situation where you have no control. there is no reason you have to choose to be vulnerable. but, plenty of people do, and then are simply shocked when someone takes advantage of that. remind me again why we need to protect stupid people in a video game about a harsh and unforgiving universe?"
5/19/2010,you really have no idea how stupid you just made yourself look do you.this is actually the whole point. this is what you and almost all new players don't understand about eve.people enter this game with previous mmo experiences in mind. that's why almost everybody will rage disproportianlythe first time he/she gets blown up. it's why most new player don't get why people pod eachother.eve is another kind of game. you can't compare what you would consider griefing gameplay to griefers in for examplewow on a pvp server. completly different concepts apply.the day you understand that is the day you will see how big an idiot you've made of yourself.
5/19/2010,"they'll never see that. they think blowing up a spaceship is comparable to a crime i can't mention due to a wordfilter. they want an all powerful entity to protect them from the world, because they sure as hell can't be expected to handle things themselves. they, subconsciously and (hopefully) fallaciously seem to believe that other people are so vastly superior to them, that they can't possibly stand a chance against them. they can't outfight, outsmart, or outplay people, and thus they're 'helpless' and need protection from ccp. realistically, they could, but they're crippled by their own fear. i mean, honestly.. do they really think 'pvp' players are some sort of unstoppable evil gods or something? a different species which they're completely unable to compete with? i'd like to think they have a bit more self esteem than that. but, no, even an army of invincible, unstoppable, unavoidable npcs who kill anyone who attacks them.. is not enough to put them on even terms with those crazy pvpers!"
5/19/2010,"your new vid baffles me. i never thought it possible to make yourself look even more *snip* removed insult. shadow. than you did in the old vid. it makes me wanna cry. and when i read your posts... o m g.i don't mind carebear candidates, but you... please leave our game alone. you can have all my stuff.please, i'm begging you. please."

5/19/2010,"you take your internet spaceships way too seriously... m'kay?i would like to thank all the anti-ahnk's for giving her so much publicity, that any non-pvp minded person in the game (who hasn't been living in a veldspar 'roid for the last month) now knows who she is and how much she annoys pvp'rs... hell, with all the free publicity given to an alleged anti-pvp candidate, she might even end up on the csm... as chairperson... i think your editorial might have been far more effective if you had ignored the person, and instead let her threads die for lack of use... guess we shall see very soon, but i fear that all the publicity is going to ensure her a place on the 5th csm...good job guys...."
5/19/2010,"she was going to win either way. she has her constituency, and it'll vote for her no matter what we say. and it's not like we can say anything to change their minds, because they'll interpret any of our complaints as evil pvpers trying to ruin their game. the harder we hit - even if it's justified - the less they'll listen. all this is a fart in a windstorm for her chances, tbh. the electoral system simply doesn't make it possible to attack someone out of the race. which is good in principle - it ensures even the small, disliked groups get representation - but man can it be annoying in practice."
5/19/2010,"because for some reason ccp did not recieve my application for csm i have to vote for the next best thing. so far the best is hands down ankhesentapemkah. the only thing the rest of you know how to do is complain about lag and being blobbed out.not only do you clearly not get eve, but you cry about making eve into something it is not. my vote goes to ankhesentapemkah!"
5/19/2010,"look, look: all the ""kewl"" pvp kids, the gank-griefers and wannabe pirates come out and cry here. ohhh the irony. so much whine from the cool class of eve, from the people who can't accept and face the fact - the reality - that eve is not only a pvp game but as well a pve game. and now those, who redicule and mock about the so called ""carebears"" and their ""whines"" are whining for themselves, because a person is nominated, who stands up for both sides: pve and pvp. i wonder, why no campaign was started against those csm candidates who wat to nerf the **** out of empire carebears... it's all so obvious. deal with it and deal with it in an educated and mature manner: now us pve players, us suicid gank victims you laughed so loud at, we have a candidate as well. you like pvp? you are one of the kewl kids? well, time to respect ""our"" candidate, as us pve-folks pay as mch for this game as you do. now go, gank someone and cry me a river."
5/19/2010,"when exactly did ankh start standing up for pvp? because last i checked, she considers shooting other players to be immoral. also, precisely which csm candidates want to ""nerf the **** out of empire carebears""? i actually looked into people's answers on csm vote match. there are exactly zero candidates with any hope of winning who are strongly in favour of moving l4's to lowsec(the standard measure of how much you want to nerf carebears), and three serious candidates who are even vaguely in favour. the idea that there's any sort of serious movement afoot to wreck empire is sheer fantasy."
5/19/2010,"hello, alt. p.s. post with your main."
5/19/2010,"this post is pure ressentiment. judging by your post, you're not voting for ankh because you think she's the best candidate, because she'll improve the game the most, because her ideas are the best, because you think she'll best represent your interests. no, you're voting for ankh because you want to stick it to pvpers, who you resent for being ""the kewl kids"". and the best way to stick it to said ""kewl kids"" is not to vote for a highly qualified, reasonable, rational carebear candidate--of which there are several--who will best defend your own interests. no, the best way to get back at the pvpers you so hate is to vote for the most flagrantly unqualified, crazy, inflammatory choice available. this is sad for two reasons. first, pvpers are not your enemies (out of game). we carebear ourselves, we depend on carebears for our ships and modules, and we want carebears to prosper--if only so that there are more targets. second, pvpers are likely to get several seats on the csm anyway, perhaps even a majority--although they will likely be split between the nullsec and lowsec/empire crowds, who actually have some fairly divergent interests. this means that it is all the more important that pveers, industrialists, carebears, etc. receive the best representation possible, something they simply will not be getting with ankh.but you don't care about any of this. all you care about is making some futile, pointless, self-defeating gesture to try to upset those arrogant libera--i mean those arrogant pvpers. you're cutting off your nose to spite your face, as is every carebear who votes for ankh simply because she ****es off pvpers."
5/19/2010,"actually, the reasons why i vote for ankh are my very personal concern. last time i checked this was a democratic election, so the specific reasons for voting a party or a person has not to be justified to the public. be assured though, that i do indeed think, that ankh is ""my"" candidate and will represent and advocate my interests in the best way.i do not ""hate"" anyone here. why and how should i? i don't know the persons behind the pixels. but i know and i read here a lot of statements that are a testimony for the opposite: the pvp crowd hates the level 4 mission runners in empire. they want to get rid of level 4 missions in highsec and so want their csms. they want even more suicide ganking, they can't stand a carebear in a marauder or faction bs and they lookout for easy targets in lowsec. yet they complain that no one comes to ""their"" lowsec. no, the haters here are the pvp crowd, as you can see judging from this thread or from other threads, where they insult and ridicule carebears.and for the record: ii do not think, that ankh is ""flagrantly unqualified, crazy, inflammatory choice available"". not more at least that some of the other (pvp) csm-candidates.then explain to me, why they constantly insult and offend and whine about carebear whines. then explain to me, why they constantly demand a drastic cut to empire actions/content/income, instead of asking to boost their part of the game. that phrase made my day: you want carebears to prosper? then explain to me please, why the majority of your csm want to cut off carebear interaction in the game. let me point you to an infame example:"
5/19/2010,"hello troll!this is my main. i came back to eve from a 2 year break and started a new toon. so deal with it. even if this would be an alt - which is not -, what makes the difference?so the call to nerf carebears is ""sheer fantasy"", ya? explain this to me then:"
5/19/2010,"no, seriously, post with your main."
5/19/2010,stop trolling. this is my main. believe it or not. what would it change anyway?your more or less rediculous oneliners and your hatred towards ankh made my day though.

5/19/2010,"thanks. but i am a ""sis"", bro!well, if there is some sort of ""deadline"" (for what actually?), then that's a coincidence indeed. up to last week or so i didn't even knew about the csm programm and the elections.but how is that related to this topic?"
5/19/2010,"hey miyamoto,when i say tougher targets, its other csm candidates with questionable history of performance in csmi'm stating it from the perspective that tribune only diverts from 'reporting the news' if there is an a target of opportunity. a soft target.i never said you should go after the good targets.my perspective is neutral. i have no allegiance to ank. don't know her nor have i voted for her. i like reading the tribuneinitially i saw that she put in effort compared to many others, but after reading her manifesto i could not agree with that. ( my votes / interest is in what teadaze has to say )ps. i could care less about paragraph or semantics like you forum warriors. next stop my grammar above is an example of how you guys exaggerate.ruin the game ? ankh has already been on csm. eve does not seemed ruined for me.lol at insinuation ccp is at the mercy of ank the publication seems to imply that every single thing that comes out from ank is toxic.that its not possible that some of her ideas will be representative of certain segments of eve & provide counterbalancenor that there is a possibility that she can put forth decent ideas in the course of the csmsometimes good ideas start off as something totally different.even ideas that look great on the surface ( cosmetic ) and sound very great from the hype might have unintended consequences once implemented in evemiyamoto, the reason i posted in your thread is not to support ank. rather how your publication is coming off in this episode.views varypss . csm scrum or whatever is not the only avenue to identify issues in this game. ccp developers would be aware of many issues that plague this game. its the will of ccp that is lacking."
5/19/2010,"accounts are only eligible to vote for a csm candidate if they've been active for 30 days or more prior to the beginning of the elections. the elections began on 05/05/10; your character was created exactly 30 days before that on 05/04/10.if i were going to run with the 'why hallo thar, alt' theme, i might point out that for a newbie (and if you've had a two year break, you are a newbie for most purposes; the game changes), you're taking a remarkably pronounced interest in the csm forums. i might also point out that if one were looking to maximise one's voting power, using the buddy program to create three new accounts just before the deadline and then trashing them after their 51 days were up would be a pretty cost-effective way of doing things."
5/19/2010,hi ankh! lacking supporters lately? i guess your alts is making up for it. but be nice to your poor keyboard. it must be burning hot with all the typing
5/19/2010,"ahh ok, i see. well you might point out whatever you want. i came back to eve iun late april and created this new toon. what ive experienced since that in the last weeks was mindcrushing. basically eve changed totally from my first approaches to this game in late 2004 to now.and it didnt change to the better. where highsec was somewhat highsec it became now ganksec. i was hauling my first million isk in my hauler to jita, when i was ganked there. i asked the suicid ganker, why he did that and he said, he would make isk even ganking an empty hauler.then i researched this very board. and i saw this issue addressed here and many similar carebear issues addressed here and i was the responses from the pirate-kiddo players as well the responses and comments from some of the csms.no csm has the right to complain about ankhs voice standing up for the carebears. and no pvp griefer has the right to do so. eve became gank-city and kid-grief-city and believe me: there are a lot of ppl out there playing this game who are not vocal on this board and who do not like the way eve is going due to the vocal minority here looking for easy targets.thats why i was researching the boards and why i and my family (3 more accounts) have voted for ankh. we like to have our small corner in eve without some stupid suicid ganker who ganks oftenonly for lulz and giggles. why even have highsec, if it is not high-sec?"
5/19/2010,"hi troll,hi griefer1becomming desperate because more and more people support ankh and her attempt to make eve better for everyone, not only the pvplers?well i got news for you: i am not ankh, as you can clearly tell from my (bad) english, but my whole familly will vote for her. believe it or not, who cares? believ whatever you want who i am and make yourself look even more silly.but something is surprising: that you are creeping out from under your puny stone of oneliners makes me beliebe, that someone hit a nerve there."
5/19/2010,"and yet, then you got 11 accounts from you and your family members all to vote for ank. what a coincidence! post with your main. how odd, and just a few days ago you were saying it was 11 votes. just one of those coincidences. just like you come back to eve after 2 years, make a new character just in time for the csm elections, immediately convince your family to go vote for a candidate... and somehow the actual main character you had two years ago gets lost in the shuffle. evidently along with 6 accounts somewhere between your initial story and your new one. post with your main. welcome to eve, where there is only one server, it's a pvp server, and ccp designed it so that undocking is consenting to the possibility for pvp. there is no such thing as safe space, only safeer space and high sec is much higher security; if i ganked you in nullsec there would be no guantee that i'd be hunted down and popped. in high sec, it's an exploit if i'm not hunted down and popped by concord. this is just basic eve stuff.oh yeah, post with your main. it's not an example of how i exaggerate, it's an example of you distorting what i said. i said that is what would happen if she was actually able to implement her ideas. has she, in fact, been able to implement her ideas like banishment to lowsec for anybody who executes a highsec gank? no? then not only was there no exaggeration, you ignored what i actually said. more dishonesty. i pointed out what would happen if she got her ideas implemented. the fact that her ideas are so insane that ccp would never take her seriously (and thus the people who are voting for her are wasting their votes in any case) is kind of the point. it's why i pointed out that an empty chair would be better than ank."
5/19/2010,"finny, you lost the discussion at the point where you just went into a personal grudgematch.i know for sure you would never make a good reporter or politician because you totally lack the ability to listen to what the opposite side has to say and keep on drudging out the same semantics over and over.and if you would have read my mock editorial then you would have replied in a whole other way, but you clearly showed that you only respond in a manner which takes part of a post or a fragment of an expression and you gon about that.you are nothing more than a populistic backstreet caller who is trying to build up a certain reputation with a certain crowd by calling and flaming just a bit louder than the rest.you have totally no intrest at all in the well being of eve but merely are out to get more fame, and since you fail at it in style you choose the next best way. the way of the bitter little nerd."
5/19/2010,"hi, enraged trolli aye, 11 accounts. 3 accounts for my close family and 8 others (even 2 more when i think about it ) from relatives and friends, who got me hooked up again.this is my main, deaf enraged trolli. yep, dear enraged deaf trolly! just like you wrote. btw, i never lost touch with eve, since my family has always since then played it actively.and, this is my main, trolly. do not become too much enraged. think about your blood pressure. it only makes you look silly and dumb and like a 12 year old kid stomping with its feet on the ground. that very same server is a pve server as well. did you forgot about that, dear enraged trolly? nowaydays there is no safer space and higher security. highsec became useless. let's talk again, when ccp introduces real ""highsec"" space by removing insurance payout from suicid gankers and more harsh sacntions against suiciders.oh yeah, and you should really stop stomping with your feet on the ground, it makes you look even more silly, cutie trolly.edit: did i tell you already, trolly-finny, that you sound and look like and enraged kid stomping with it's feet on the ground, because it didn't get the cake? ""post with your main, wah, wah, wah, this si not your main, wah , wah, wah i want to know your main, wah, wah, wah"".believe it or not, no one cares, but: there is no santa claus and this is my main, trolly."
5/19/2010,"mmmm hmmm. 11 accounts. no, wait, four accounts. no, wait, 13 accounts! but your account which you started two years ago mysteriously has no characters on it and only had a 1 month old character. your main, post with it."
5/19/2010,"you aren't a very pleasant person, are you."
5/19/2010,"exactly. well, kid, you might realize that some of us are older, have a familly, have a job, need to care for kids and husband and well, it might elude you, but some for some of us the world does not revolve only around eve and how to gank the next target...but finny-trolly, i understand you perfectly. my kids are the same like you: in school they sometimes only think at eve. they cant wait to get to the pc; turn on ts and have their fun.i unfortunately, i cant afford that kind of life anymore and thus eve became less important to me. i lost the data of my old char, so i am starting over. so what, trolly finn??does that hurt you personally? does that violates your naturaly eve law? is eve now going to explode in your head? trolly, i told you already: everything will be fine and no, you cant have the sweeties now and no, you cant watch tv now, you need to do your homework first. and no, stomping with your feets will not help it. and no, the world will not explode, just because there are 1 month old characters posting on the boards. i know, dear trolly finny, you cant stand that, but what are you going to do about it now?now you have two reasons for your miserable life: ankh and a 4 week old character. sorry, about that, but eventually you will be fine again, i promise!/me puts a lolly in finn-trollys mouth.oh , i only play on the same level like that finny-guy there. actually i am an easy girl to like, but sometimes certain people will not understand until you show them their face in a mirror."
5/19/2010,"you can not possibly ""lose the data"" for an account. you go to ""my account"", put in your username, and then click on the link right next to ""forgot you password?"". and if you forgot your username you just check your email for an activation email from ccp with the title ""eve online: registration confirmation"" where it tells you your username. post with your main."
5/19/2010,"i didn't knew that. as i said, eve is not as important to me as it is for you obviously. and what do you do, if i won't do that simply because i can't do that, trolly? well i could create another character and tell you that is my main... would that ease your pain, kid? because i am a nice person i would do so, if that suits and comforts you. you seem to be very obsessed by that ""post with your main"" thing. poor dude. i feel sorry for you actually. i tell you what: we go together to the park, i will spend icecream for you and everything will be allright. hell, i even make a new character and call it ""main"", if you want. jszt don't stompo to much with your feet again...."
5/19/2010,"right, who knew that sites on the internet have a ""forgot your password?"" link pretty much all the time, or that ccp might have some sort of account management. and none of your three, no eleven, no thirteen relatives told you. but you managed to create an account right in time for the csm, and only post about csm topics (almost exclusively about ank) and you got your three, no eleven, no thirteen relatives to all vote for the candidate you like, but it never occured to you to ask them ""so, i forgot my password for my eve account, how can i get it?"" log your main in and post with it. fyp."
5/19/2010,accusing him to be young or underage is no way to win an argument. it's easier if you tackle his points head on instead of resorting to ad hominem attacks. it just makes you look underage and that you're trolling. it's also a good sign that you're loosing the debate
5/19/2010,"correct. simply because there are more important things to me than a pixel character in a computer game, dear kid. who care for a 2 year old character? dont spread lies. i posted on various topics. not only about ankh.ohh i get it: you are enraged because someone is not agreeing with your favorite trolling area and supports ankh. i am sorry, i hurt your little kiddo pvp feelings. poor one. noooo, there is no santa claus, i cant do a thing about that, sorry. i had to tell you one day, trolly-finny! stomping with your feet wont change that, but i have some calmatives for you. once , when your are grown up, you will realize that there are more important things to learn and experience out. and yes, up to then you might keep you main toy and play with it."
5/19/2010,"well i tried that, but at a certain point it makes no sense to argue with small children anymore. they won't simply comprehend and insist on their sweeties and toys. if they don't get it they start to cry and to crush things or to sompt with their feets. so what else can i do?may i ask you: what debate""? a debate about mains? cmon, dont get silly. where is that ""debate"" actually? i only see kiddo demanding things i can't deliver. stuff, (""post with your main""), that is complelty meaningless to this whole discussion. so, i don't care here, if i ""lose "" something or not.hm i want to help this kid, but i dont know how. i could ask a corp mate to post for me and tell him that this is my main, or i siply create a new toon, if that helps him. it looks like it is causing pain to finn-troll."
5/19/2010,"attacks and snobbery at his age (which you don't know) makes you look the fool. the fact that you're a brand new character, coupled with the fact that you've only posted on threads that discuss ankh with the exception of one thread in gd but the content of the thread along with text and style you used is a close match to ankh is good enough proof for him. if you feel you can't convince him, then drop it. actually the debate is whether ankh is a suitable csm candidate or not. the argument about mains is a sideshow to the rest of the argument. if you wish to put forth the fact that ankh is suitable (!) then you need to argue the fact. however, the point i made above already has you at a disadvantage."
5/19/2010,"and yet you've convinced everybody in your family to vote for someone to improve the game for those ""pixel characters"". hrmmm....as for why an established character with skillpoints is valuable, and definitely more valuable than a character you have to start from scratch? i don't believe that you really don't understand why that is. just get your main already. i promise that the mean gankers probably won't hunt you down, much, with our locator agents (which ccp totally didn't mean to put in the game at all, nope).speaking of spreading lies, you'll notice the word ""almost"" before ""exclusively"".and let's go back to your posting history. out of all of your posts, one is not about the csm (but it is a whine about csm issues and pvpers). of the others, which are all csm posts, 74% are about ank. of the rest of your csm posts, one was the very first postin a thread, only eight minutes after the original post (searching for the mention of a specific name, perhaps?). that thread's original post just happened to mention ank's habit of spamming mission hubs. your response was to change the subject and get your hate on. every single other csm post you made was attacking a candidate you don't like for, hilariously, ""spamming mails and channels"" and for ""denigrating those, who don't agree with your small and personal view of eve"" (like gankers),and, most hilariously of all, you claimed he was ""not suited to candidate for a csm seat, due to your prematurity and your lack of respect for the paying customer(s) who do not share your point of view."" then you went back to arguing that the person who believes that pvpers are psychopathic virgins is the best choice for the csm."
5/19/2010,"actually, you are right. i simply will ignore his ""post with your main"" crap, though i really get a kick out of it. look, why should i argue with him about that? why should i argue with anyone about this?it is like real life politics: the support of the one candidate will tell the supporters of the competing candidate, that that person is not suitable for nomination. so, who the **** cares?i have decided, that ankh is a very suitable candidate and last time i checkd, i was living in a free world. i do not need some kid whining the same whine over and over again (like ""post with your main"") to make up my mind. i am accountable to none concerning the decisions i make, am i?but i can very well pronounce an opinion, why this or that behaviour is childish and why i support that candidate.i really don't care if i am ""loosing"" something in a video game world or even more losing a debate on a forum with some obvious pvp kid arguing with me about some main or not main. but it entertains me, tbh."
5/19/2010,"it's funny that you're a 1 month old character who just so happens to be unable to access his main and whose interest is totally taken up with supporting ank, complaining about csm changes that ank disagrees with, and using ank's sort of rhetoric to complain about how pvpers suck. luckily nobody has ever created an alt before for propaganda purposes. what luck that you don't have a main you can post with. what luck!"
5/19/2010,i thought you ank bashers all thought all ank supporters were actually alts of ank herself?
5/19/2010,"hell ya, i pay for all of those accounts. and the other ones i didnt need to convince. we had a short conversation about the csm and we came all to the same result: ankh is it. kid, as i said, the game doesnt mean most likely as much to me as it means for you. i had a character, that was 2 months old (or so) a long long time ago, so not a lot is lost. who cares?oh kid, please, please dont hurt me!!!! please dont hurt me! i beg you!!!! noooo. i am sooo scared. i am so scared that a pixel character will make the effort and waste his time to kill my pixel character in highsec. it really menas much to me, soooo much. ya, that should hurt me.i tell you what: i frecking dont care. quite the opposite: i find it hilarious, that you want to kill me ingame because you cant convice me that ankh is a bad candidate. kinda proves my point about griefers thoughif it eases your pain, i can log in right now and tell you where i am - so you don't even need a locator - and then you are free to gankg and kill me. ok? will that help you, finnwhatevertroll?this only proves my point and confirms my decision for ankh more and more. you are nothing but a frustrated and enraged pvp griefer. so come and get your gank already. i am all for helping out."
5/19/2010,omg - this has got to be either:a) an ankh altb) an ankh wannabe.i really can't decide which is worse.
5/19/2010,"it's not an example of how i exaggerate, it's an example of you distorting what i said. i said that is what would happen if she was actually able to implement her ideas. has she, in fact, been able to implement her ideas like banishment to lowsec for anybody who executes a highsec gank? no? then not only was there no exaggeration, you ignored what i actually said. more dishonesty. i pointed out what would happen if she got her ideas implemented. the fact that her ideas are so insane that ccp would never take her seriously (and thus the people who are voting for her are wasting their votes in any case) is kind of the point. it's why i pointed out that an empty chair would be better than ank. i'm not distorting anything. ""if she got her ideas implemented? she'd ruin the game""ccp is not going to implement radical ideas that destroy the sand-box nature of this game. that's eve online main selling point and niche in mmo's'what if's ' scenarios regarding ankh seem like fear tacticsshe has been csm before & eve looks decent to me so i guess she is not the harbinger of doomthe concentrated vilification seems a bit over the top especially if publications jump in1 person ( ankh ) 'evil' influence need to be counteracted. my bad i didn't realize all the other csm are so easily turned.just saying there should be an outlet for everyone views. people play this game in differing ways. so its possible that these very opposing views could ignite/ generate some sort of compromise ideas down the road that would benefit the community.if csm is only about 1 cliche and a certain subset of ideas better just get ccp employees to read all this stuff on a subforum & everyone can pat themselves on the back there.empty chair candidates are epic fail to the community. the csm meetings being current platform to voice views they not only harm the community but possibly even deprived us of some catalyst for ideas.if people use vote match >> eve online vote match i'm sure people will get surprising matches on various issues with multiple candidates including the dreaded ankh far from the toxic image that you are projecting"
5/19/2010,"so you're pretty much admitting that you were dishonestly distorting what i actually said when i pointed out what would happen if her ideas were implemented. not only do you understand the ""if --> then"" statement, you agree with exactly what i said, her ideas would destroy the game. your apologia for ank is weak. you're now actually arguing ""the facts of what would happen if she actually got her views enacted is just fear mongering! and the fact that she can't get her views enacted and thus is a wasted vote has no bearing on the discussion!"" more dishonesty. nobody said they'd be ""turned"", in fact i pointed out that ank would be of less value than an empty seat and at best she'd simply be balanced out by sane csmers. and as we were using ank's own words to point out ank's own views, claiming that we've ""vilified"" her is something less than honest. like a kitten is something less than a tiger. more dishonesty. the article and both miya and myself have pointed out that there are numerous good carebear candidates, but that ank simply isn't one. p.s. vote match matches up soundbytes, and is pretty good at it, but it's not a totally substantive way to compare ideologies. you won't, for instance, find statements like ""gankers are psychopathic virgins who should be put into some sort of 'jail' and barred from going into empire even after 1 single suicidegank."""
5/19/2010,"don't you go telling people i am an ank alt. i have my own opinions and i don't mind a discussion, however this isn't a discussion anymore since the thread started.next to this i am going to establish a moderated discussion forum.moderated in the form that there will be part of the forums open for postings of csm candidates and pre appointed and approved intervieuwers,part of the forums where only a specific csm will have access to post to point out why they should be in the csm and on what points the other csm points might be flawed.those 2 seperate parts of the forums will not be open for general postings to prevent derailment in general as happens a lot on the eve forums.next to that there will be an open discussion forum in which people can express their opinions. this doesn't mean however that everything is a go. there will be a certain level of maturity and responcebility set for posting.meaning that several points of eve rules about forum posting will be maintained at the forum i am going to set up aswel.being:be respectful of others at all times. the purpose of the forum is to provide a platform for the exchange of ideas. occasionally, there will be conflicts that arise when people voice opinions. be courteous when disagreeing with others. it is possible to disagree without being insulting.ranting is prohibited a rant is a long-winded, redundant post, often filled with angry, non-constructive comments. a free exchange of ideas is essential to building a strong sense of community and helpful in the development of the game, but rants are disruptive and incite flaming and trolling. please post your thoughts in a concise, clear manner and avoid going off on rambling tangents. personal attacks are prohibited. commonly known as flaming, personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another. text of this nature is not beneficial to the community spirit and will not be tolerated. corporation, faction and alliance members and other players are cautioned to avoid allowing in character disputes from becoming ""out of character"" personal attacks. the game is designed for role-playing and/or portraying a role and it is sometimes easy for tempers to flare when the lines between the virtual world and the real world are crossed. please keep in-game disputes in the game and off the forum unless it is clearly a mutual, in-character exchange.trolling is prohibited. trolling is the word used to describe a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting the players. posts of this nature are disruptive and do not contribute to the sense of community we want for our forums. i will appoint some moderators from various alliances to see to it those rules are enforced.i want a real discussion forum where csm's can have their space to express their opinions without derailment and another space where they will have to answer to the public.unfortunatly the eve forums don't offer this service and thus i am going to work on providing this.my personal opinions aside i am going to do my utmost best to keep it impartial and purely informative on one side and open for real discussions at the otehr side."
5/19/2010,"if you aren't willing to defend your opinion, why should any of us give a flying **** what you think? all your posts so far support my initial hypothesis that you're voting for ankh out of ressentiment, not reason. that, and that neither you nor your thirty-seven alts/friends/relatives just don't ""get"" eve."
5/19/2010,"i wonder about that, too. but obviously some of ""you"" give a ""flying ****"", otherwise this thread woulnd't exist and otherwise finn-trolly wouldn't act like he does.odd, isn't it?"
5/19/2010,"ho brother, i see emotions are starting to soar. relax guys, it's only a game. even if ank is elected, she is just one seat and has been on 2 previous csm's, eve actually became a better place during those times in my book. if only for the skill queue that was implemented. hell, even darius johnson (who was on the same csm, you know, the former ceo of former mega-grief-alliance goonswarm)complimented ank and said she was great to work with."
5/19/2010,this argument is starting to make my eyes bleed.
5/19/2010,"you have my vote trebor.i gave a cursory glance at all of the other candidates and your message really stuck.but what really sold me was your ability to engage in debate on your talking points and beyond.i found these points the most compelling:1. you have lots of industry experience (in both development and customer service).2. you aren't afraid to admit when you are wrong.3. you engage in point / counter-point until an idea is refined (as the process should be).4. you are willing to accept others ideas to help promote other causes if they are in the best interest of eve.i think the idea of a player run ""police"" force would be a great idea. possible idea could be that a person with kill rights could transfer or bestow the kill rights to other people or an anti-ganking ""police"" corp to allow for retribution to occur. the ganker still gets to be a douch<U+FFFD> but at the risk of a horde coming down on him for it. this seems like it would involve minimal changes to how kill rights are managed, but that is only an assumption.i do think as csm it would be great if you could take worthy ideas from users and help refine them to ensure the highest chance of acceptance.best of luck to you!"
5/19/2010,"wow, what can i say, other than ""gee mom, i didn't know you played eve!"" one of the things you have to very carefully consider is the unanticipated consequences. if there is a way to game the mechanic, eve players will (quite rightly!) push it to the very bleeding-edge limit. look at how useless bounties are, for example. retribution is all fine and dandy, but if the ganker doesn't care if you pop him, what's the point?in the long run, probably the only way to make a particular mechanic available but self-limiting is by putting economic forces to work. in the case of ganking, the obvious tweak would be insurance changes.please note that i am not at all convinced there needs to be any changes. if you're being trusted to move high-value cargo, you ought to damn well know how to make yourself 99.44% gank-proof. my major concern would not so much be ganking but noob griefing. but feel free to try and convince me otherwise.it's like the t2 bpo issue (addressed earlier in the thread); i have no strong feelings one way or the other about if t2 bpos should be withdrawn, but definite ideas on how it could be done equitably."
5/19/2010,you have my votes!11!
5/19/2010,"can we get tech2 fofs, btw? i'd like them to deal some proper damage or have a warp-disrupting effect."
5/19/2010,"dont worry brenda, you will get this, the only people on these forums anymore are trolls everyone else thinks csm is an alliance"
5/19/2010,you will get my vote
5/19/2010,"last day, so please vote for me, today!!!"
5/19/2010,vote for teadaze. because he is the best candidate.
5/19/2010,votes in to a candidate who hasn't acted like a child.
5/19/2010,.... but to make that happen you have to cast your final votes herehelp extreme make it into csm-5!thank you!
5/19/2010,i agree everyone should vote cat!
5/19/2010,"well tbh this is somewhat a main, going to transfer the char to a new account and skill him up, i like the name and the portrait, so in theory i have already exposed my main."
5/19/2010,i kind of hope cat gets in. if only to find out if it's cat or jake who's gonna attend the meetings.
5/19/2010,"kind sire, might i inquire as to your main alt character?"
5/19/2010,"beanbag!!! you're the greatest!and i do really hope that, since cat is all about getting more community interaction, that cat wins!"
5/19/2010,"hi cat herenow i dont condone the murder of any characters expecially one as artistic and brutal such as yourself lol now you may call me a hypocrite but leaving eve had to go. he only caused trouble lolinteresting question lol but tbh i find it hard to speak in lowercase and without punctuation while lol'ing the whole damn time. so we shall see. xas a weird coincidence, i was in a corp with masternerdguy for a while"
5/19/2010,i thought it had been nice and quiet around here.
5/19/2010,99% sure i know who your main is
5/19/2010,you go girl mmmm...
5/19/2010,moved from eve general discussion to jita park speakers corner as this is the appropriate platform for this thread.
5/19/2010,*snip* fairly inappropriate. shadow.
5/19/2010,"posting in another thread that ccp appleguy's flicked into the dark abyss.yes, the pook is ""as cute as a button"" level cute which is what everyone loves!so really though...who won?swifty - i found them both! you can't hide from me!"
5/19/2010,"according to the devblog, they're sitting on the results for another nine days for some reason."
5/19/2010,"may they burn in hell they are doing a ""george bush"" on the votes aren't they?"
5/19/2010,"so - time is almost up to vote - so let me make one last appeal highlighting 'the cool **** i have done'* as an astronomer working on asteroid impact modeling my job was frequently described as 'saving the world from killer asteroids' - during my employment in this capacity there were no recorded disasters due to killer asteroids. * i taught a 5 year old girl how to play eve.* i'm the only csm candidate who can claim to have helped write a new york times bestselling science fiction book. * the eve client uses code i helped create - back when i worked with the xiph people i worked on ogg/vorbis which is used eve audio (yes, eve has sound).* eve radio is also an indirect descendent of my 'pioneering' (read, quick hack) mp3 internet radio station back in the mid 90's. * i has awesum dj skillz!!!* i have photos of certain high ranking ccp employees which could be considered embarrassing.(although probably not)to sum up my campaign in one word - spaecshipps!!!"
5/19/2010,all 4 of my votes went to t'amber.
5/19/2010,"i've currently got a total of 8 accounts which are willing to sell their votes. (friends n myself)please feel free to convo me if you'd like to buy them.p.s. i soon expect to get a fair few more people, just waiting for them to log on. i'd expect to be able to a total of around 20/30 accounts. thanksjovoich"
5/19/2010,"you able to buy t2 bpos, unlike state ravens. (although a couple did sell last year for stupid amounts)i really don't see the issue, apart from ""waaaa they have one and i don't"" syndrome."
5/19/2010,this is the only correct answer.
5/19/2010,i would like to vote for a candidate who will make it their mission to block any t2 bpo conspiracy nut from making any sort of impact on the csm.people like the op are in favor of eternal grind and should really be playing lineage 2 instead.
5/19/2010,"if you think it's a farce, vote abstain. only way to get this opinion counted."
5/19/2010,"so, you intentionally want to vote for a moron ?!?the t2 bpo ""problem"" - everything you probably never wanted to know about t2 bpos.unless the reader has the mental capacity of a slow 5th grader, they should eventually be able to understand why t2 bpos aren't really a ""problem that needs urgent fixing"", because of two things : it's not really that much of a problem in the first place _and_ any possible ""solution"" is arguably worse than the current situation (at least any of the solutions anybody ever came up with so far).you, dear sir, must be bloody blind.jita park speakers corner, that's the right one.""[...]discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar management"", that's right there in the description."
5/19/2010,"both are grammatically correct, actually."
5/19/2010,"well, bpos will be bpos, but the bpo's stats are in the showinfo.you see, it all depends on the context."
5/19/2010,i would risk saying that 90% of the world population uses languages which dont use apostrophes on regular basis.
5/19/2010,moved from eve general discussion to jita park speakers corner channel as this is the proper place for this discussion.
5/19/2010,let's rephrase that... probably 90% of native english speakers have a crappy understanding of english spelling&grammar.the percentage is lower for non-native english speakers with which you can actually carry a decent english conversation.you can pretty much spot a lot of native english speakers by their appalling sms-speak writing.
5/19/2010,i do have to agree that native english speaking players have a lot of times a unique way of typing in chat.i couldn't care less since english isn't even my second language and therefor i fail a lot of times in basic english and thus have no right of speach in that regard.plus i took lessons in reading typonese. this helps for several languages at the same time.
5/19/2010,"as with most single-issue questions, vote match has the answer. the candidates strongly in favour of killing t2 bpo's are mynxee, issler dainze, chip mintago, and teadaze. all of them but chip have a reasonable chance of winning. cast your vote accordingly."
5/19/2010,"i, too, have a view on t2 bpos that i addressed in this thread. if you don't feel like reading it (it's really not very long), my solution is to keep t2 bpos unchanged unless a change of some type was forced. if forced, my alternative is to have t2 bpos have degrading me levels (that stay non-negative), and i go into reasons why in the thread."
5/19/2010,"just want to say i'm fully behind what you stand for, eve needs a rebuild of stale old systems i.e. faction warfare and bounty hunting. however i've read quite a few of the candidates lists and yours is very comprehensive of the right things!good luck!"

5/20/2010,these ships are so bad i completely forgot they were ingame
5/20/2010,like stealth bombers?
5/20/2010,definitely need a boost. i've had a redeemer kicing about for ages. my suggestions:leave cloaking as it isremove weapon bonuses add bonuses to increase sensor strength per level (harder to probe out) and/or reduce signature radiussmall increase to jump rangeother alternative options for thought:the black ops feels like a covert support ship not an all out combat ship - probably should only be warping in to battle after the stealth bombers and recons have decimated the field and its arrival is purely to mop up the survivors.add bonuses to remote repair - not as much as logistics but enough to support the covert fleet for extended engagements.possibly even allow it fit a gang assist module
5/20/2010,"bumped...we want the old cyno effects back, or a new one!"
5/20/2010,"i support this again, to keep it on the top. however, you guys ever notice, no one from ccp ever acknowledges this thread? capitals used to be shock and awe. now, when they appear, it's just like, um yeah....just another ship appeared"
5/20/2010,/signed please bring back the old effects or make even better ones!does anyone know why ccp removed it to begin with????
5/20/2010,"yes, you are correct. taranis gets double the %, thus counting for two. although i don't want to derail this individual's thread, so we'll just leave it at that. my only complaint with the op is that i'd rather see a role bonus as opposed to a 4th. i just think that a role bonus fix would be a better addition and last the test of time as opposed to the unknown reprecussions of experimenting with the 4th bonus for each individual ship.my previous idea was just a suggestion based on my own personal pet peeves with afs."
5/20/2010,"in my experience (only minmatar af's) to give a combined bonus to all is the wrong way. all of them dont even need a bonus, they need a slot. retribution really doesn't need a bonus, it needs a medslot. wolf really the same thing. jaguar the again needs the ab speed bonus (maybe 5% per af level?) or tracking bonus. the jaguar should newer get to the same m/s and tracking as the dramiel does, but give them something to make it really useful. althought jaguar is one of the few good af's at this moment.wolf needs a medslot or ab speed. a medslot to fit a webifier or ab speed to make it fast enough. it should newer be the same speed as jaguar, but little more would really be good.retribution needs the damned scramblerslot or 100% rolebonus to basespeed. then they would not need a speedmod to be relatively fast and could fit a point in the midslot. if the midslot would be used to speedmod, it would be insanely fast (whitch fights against amarr general behaviour), but once again would not be able to tackle or any ewar.to the ishkur i would give little (5% per af level) ab speed also. no further bonuses or slotlayoutchanges needed. it would increase it's survivalibility enough.to fix rockets in general would fix two of the af's pretty well, but as i have absolutely no experience in them, i better not say anything of those :)sorry if doubleposting, didnt read the whole shabang.ericedit: forgot to support"
5/20/2010,"congratulations on inventing minmatari said it before and i say it again: there will be no proper solution to this issue until ccp deals with damage phobia.any ""alternative"" solution to blasters, such as the one i quoted, will simply decrease diversity by making things same. or infringe on special roles of other races, thus guaranteeing future headache of fixing emergent problems with those other races."
5/20/2010,"do not cut my words from sentence. i indicated that i do not know exact complete solution because it is very difficult. as for me increasing gallente dps is not a bad idea. this boost will slightly balance gallente (but not solve) and will not brake gallente role of close face eater. now there is no sense to use blasters because lasers do 85% dps at 300% optimal and ac shoot farther with selective damage (on fastest ships in the game). there is only 1 reason to shoot blasters - you do not want to spend several months for other race bs and weapon :)i would completely switch to amarr or minmatar if eve had no dominix, ishtar and ac myrm :)"
5/20/2010,"hybrids could do dot. that would be a niche no other ship has. it wouldn't match the graphics, but the graphics already don't match the way damage is done already (torps look like aoe but aren't, lasers look like dot but aren't, projectiles shouldn't instantly hit targets but they do, etc)."
5/20/2010,"i mentioned a penetration mechanic in the railgun thread but was told no no no no no! by liang.to be honest it didn't look overpowered or unbalanced. the only tank type that suffered more than any other would be the passive shield tank. could that be your ""dot""?"
5/20/2010,"damage over time. it would impact all tanks similarly. what a penetration mechanic would do is turn everything a hybrid shoots into a hull tanker. there are fewer mods to support hull tanks, which is why only real men hull tank. it would take a ton of work to rebalance all the ships. imagine killing a titan or super carrier simply by bypassing their normal tank (which usually has hp modifiers and resists at 90+%) and ripping through their hull that has no modifiers and can't get resists past 60%. the bigger the ship, the more vulnerable they would be to a penetration mechanic unless ccp followed the hybrids with massive boosts to hull hp on pretty much all ships. this would be the weird situation created by a penetration mechanic.and what about structures? would hybrids bypass the reinforce mechanic or would they be left with a noticeable nerf whenever they shoot something that reinforces?"
5/20/2010,"no thats not how my idea worked at all. my idea for a penetration mechanic didn't just bypass tanks. give me a minute, i'll copy and paste it from the railgun thread.its a bit long to transfer over and spread over a few posts. its easy to find, its on pages 24 and 25 of the railgun thread. as you will see its not a simple ""i win"" mechanic."
5/20/2010,i read it in the railgun thread when you originally posted it. you modified the penetration mechanic suggested long ago to be like the mechanic in place for <25% shields. your idea was better than the old idea. i still worry how that would impact tanking as your idea would be a rather significant nerf to shield tanks (who have paper thin armor) and have max effectiveness (all shield tanks benefit from passive tank) at 30% shields (which would be passing a lot of damage into their weak armor/hull tanks).
5/20/2010,"yes but most of the volley would be hitting the shield in a buffer tank anyways as the mechanic puts most of the volley there by sharing it out in a ratio according to shield:armour:structure. a heavy shield buffer tank tank ratio could be 5:1:1 so if a penetrating hit was scored which is chance based, 5 parts of damage would hit shields and 1 part would hit armour. that 1 part then had a modifier of 50%. so for ease a volley of 6 damage, 5 hits shields and 0.5 hits armour. after applying resists this ammount of damage bleed through could be acceptable as a boost to hybrids. its just lateral thinking instead of moar damage!"
5/20/2010,"putting peak dps at the target within web range quickly, stop targets at gates solo without gimped tackling range and the ability to control range within web range where things that made blaster ships good at her niche. putting back the ""lethal"" in web range for gank style blaster pvp is a long overdone step and provides a lot more diversity than a bit more dps would do."
5/20/2010,"my idea for gallente niche is that operating blasters should be difficult, but those who can manage it, overcome the obstacles, would get rewarded by unparalleled dps strength. and that means a difference of more than a single damage mod on any other ship.minmatar should do what you mentioned, be optimized for ease of use as opposed to dps power."
5/20/2010,"i would be the last one agreeing against a dps boost for blasters, i did fly them with maximum gank all the time. then again i don't see the point without tweaking close range for blaster ships in favour of the blaster ship again. you request a very very limited small gang tool, i basically do the same, with the difference that the ships would be useful for solo pvp again.minmatar ships already do what i mentioned. there should not be a minmatar patent of being the all out solo pvp solution. if you are ready to take all the drawbacks and let go gtfo ability there should be a option for people that going in for a kill and are ready to die for it."
5/20/2010,"tweaking close range in positive manner would be undoing the great nano nerf. make webs 90%, remove mwd deactivation for scramble, make ships fast again.that has worked in the past, then ccp had to **** things up.raw damage is a single factor that can be used to manipulate balance in this case. it is the easiest way that would involve least amount of unexpected errors. alternative balancing requires adjustment of multiple variables, the consequences of which are harder to predict and harder to tune properly.while i don't doubt that balance can be achieved by adjusting many different factors, i simply find it unnecessary complication. and i don't trust ccp with anything complicated. we gotta keep things as simple as possible for them to get it right."
5/20/2010,have to support this.
5/20/2010,"i'd say railguns should do a higher alpha than beams but lower alpha than artillery. higher dps than artillery (much higher not 5-6 dps) but same or lower dps as beams. if that's not balanced enough you can increase the cap cost and maybe reduce tracking. also give them a bonus where they gain 30% overheat bonus instead of 15%, but make them burn up faster. give them a big damage modifier increase, but also lower their rate of fire to compensate. a railgun needs to charge up its capacitors and charge up the magnetic impulses in order to fire and that takes time. but as a result it should unleash a powerful shot. you have a better chances of volleying certain targets better than lasers, but not to the extreme extend as artillery. the dps should be close to lasers, but not surpassing.this should also help address the problems of hybrid charges as they are twice the size of projectile ammo. a rokh would run out of ammo much faster than a maelstrom.railguns should be powerful, not wimpy.currently railguns have the weaknesses of both lasers and projectiles, but possess not of their strengths."
5/20/2010,bump'd
5/20/2010,"ah, yeah. but we are asking for the ability to configure more than _one_ option + stealth bump."

5/20/2010,"""wanna get high?"""
5/20/2010,this guy seems legit.
5/20/2010,"in general terms armor tank should be more sustainable and cap efficient compared to armor reps. however deadspace and faction shield boosters completely beats armor reps in nearly every category including efficiency of hp/cap, not to mention you have the ability to mount a shield boost amplifier on them without additional cap consumption and speed reduction. sure it costs more money. but if you look at the point that armor tankers don't even have that option. armor tankers have a skill that decreases their cycle time and shield tankers have a skill that reduces their cap usage.lets make a comparison at the biggest and the best x-type of both shield and armorarmor cap cost repaired cycle time hp/cap hp/sec core-x large 400 1120 15s 2.8 75centus-x large 450 1260 15s 2.8 84corpus-x large 450 1260 15s 2.8 84shieldpith-x x-large 400 840 4s 2.1 210 gist-x x-large 204 670 4s 3.2 168if you notice the pith type is lower in efficiency vs the armor reps at the cost of an astounding amount of recovery. a single pith x-type will tank better than 2 centus x-types and it will cost less by current contract prices. a single pith x-type is cheaper than a centus x-type by nearly half.the real astounding part is the fact that gist x-types have better cap efficiency than the armor reps. and despite the lower hp/sec it tanks as well as 2 centus x-types!a deadspace shield small booster will come close or beat a medium tech 2 shield booster in tanking.a deadspace armor small repper will not. the same applies to mediums. a pith a-type medium is very popular for uses in battleships these days thanks to its great tank in the matters of its cap efficiency.high meta armor reps need to be looked at and fix to put them on the same balance as shield. currently armor has a much greater limit in comparison on shield."
5/20/2010,i agree with you that active armor tanking in general needs a buff so it gets more use in pvp but i don't think that it should be done only on faction reps if at all the whole active armor tanking should be revisited.
5/20/2010,"i don't agree. armor tanking has a ton of other benifits that shield tanking doesn't have.armor tanks don't get their tank killed by fitting the mid slot dependent warfare items like tackling gear, propulsion boosts, ewa, and more. do any of these in a shield tank and you have a paper tank left as a result.armor vs shields is fine and probably better due to the preference for remote armor repping over shields."
5/20/2010,"i see you are caldari, of course you would oppose to these changes.shields get the option putting damage mods, hull upgrades, eccm mods, etc."
5/20/2010,yes yes remove that
5/20/2010,tbh. black screen. with your blue ball and colored point. ever try finding the not bright red ball when your in a system with a red sun?
5/20/2010,"totally agree, so hard to see with that shadow"
5/20/2010,"the problem is more in depth. first of all, i would love to see the profession of bounty hunting becoming solved. at least it is, why i wanted to play eve. becoming somewhen some kind of boba fett, now honestly, isnt that something that drives all of us?as long, as a bounty hunter gets faction hits for killing others for cash, he wont become something different than that what he is hunting: a contract killer, poopoo-pirate.for my point of view it is much cheaper and more easy to become a pirate than it should be. i can kill in lowsec and fly back home without being harmed by police, or bounty hunters. you would have to do bad things for a long time that it has a slight impact on your faction at all. on the other side of the medal, why should anyone, who is in lowsec, go back to high sec? a second char helps a lot, brings everything you need and you can do waht you want. being a pirate is cheap, easy to afford. no ships of them have a high value. and they only attack when they are sure to win.bounty hunting in high sec is therefore not of sense. and regarding that pvp in eve is just related to numbers and not to quality a bounty hunter (solo) will never have chance, quite no matter how good his ship is fitted. 2 10.000 isk frigs can easily kill a bs. due to that mechanics in game even thinking about is waste of time.a bounty huntin corp could be an idea. but there is like no income then at all, since most pirates kill themselves as soon as the bounty is high enough.solving that would only be possible if:1.) bounty is set by players, but controlled by concorde.- players having a bounty on them will be shot by gate guns in high and low sec- players having a bounty on them will be attacked by police in high sec2.) additional amount for offering the bounty to players over concord bueraus.- like a mission, bounty hunters can ask for fugitives after they have proofed their loyalty (7.5 status) to a certain faction (station/corp were bounty is offered for example)- players accepting that mission can hunt fugitives without being harmed by police, gate guns and faction losses.- players with a bounty on their head can pay release fees of triple amount of headcount to come free from being listed on the wanted roster.- instead of cash the reward should be lps for example. all lps should be depending on faction and numbers of kills.- as long as you are on the roster, insurance will not pay anything for any of your ships.- as a fugitive person you are not allowed to run a corp. being a member of a corp signs the whole corp as fugitive and corp looses faction to max negative after 48 hrs of information that a member of the corp is wanted by police and bounty hunters. corp members assisting a fugitive corp member vs a legitimate bounty hunter loose faction immediatly and will also be listed on roster.- trading with fugitives also sets your faction to negative immediatly.- cans drifting in space cannot be opened by fugitives.- faction to concord or bounty hunters guild only can be raised by kills of fugitive players.- bounty hunters need to have highest faction values (10.0) for at least 1 empire.- bounty hunters must have a sec status of higher than 5.0- placing a bounty on the head of a player requires that the player has a negative sec standing or a killmail prooving the legitimate offending. this way lowsec would become more populated and pirates cannot use public stations. they have to be on their own and independent in everything. then it would become fair and interesting hunting those noobs.it is much too easy for pirates anyways."
5/20/2010,why waste a thread when you know the above will be the answer?
5/20/2010,"if you poke a bear enough, it will move. it might take your head off, but it will move. we are poking."
5/20/2010,"everyone sells their ore/mins at market value. ccp is addressing the poor isk/hr in mining through loot drop nerf.the low isk/hr your making on entry-level mining has nothing to do with other miners, macro or otherwise.the effects on the market by ccp designed seeds are much more powerful then any amount of mining.lets make eve really tedious to play, lets scan users hardware/software and have it melt their hd if a signature is found.that's a sure-fire ""solution"". we can get rid of macros by getting rid of all miners!!! awesome idea!"
5/20/2010,"in-case anyone missed it this is the key to this whole thing.* you can't design any system to beat macros, that's like saying you can make something 100% secure.* any system designed to make macros more difficult instead incorrages them as it is seen as a challenge.* punishing legit users is never a solution.* immersion breaking anti-bot measures such as captcha or mini-games will progressively make the game suck.* mining is tedious enough as it is.so where is the solution if it's not in making macros more difficult?in making mining less tedious maybe?like the ""war on drugs"" zero-tollerance and mandatory sentencing doesn't work.instead harm-reduction and support has been shown to be much more effective.ccp has the right idea, stop asking them to screw it all up."
5/20/2010,"i'm really sorry but you are deluded if think its a social problem.the problem is very simply. its one of money.gold sellers make lots and lots and lots of money by selling isk.to do this they need this use macro miners, why, because it requires very little in terms of manpower. 1 person could quite easily maintain many many ships macro mining without having to be anywhere near a machine.at the moment it is far to easy for somebody to macro mine as i and many others have already explained.something needs to be changed to stop macro mining from being so easy. one way would be remove the ability for a person to leave the clients running all day unattended. this only would make an impact. even it meant reducing there mining ability say by 10 - 15% this would help as it would make them raise there prices of the isk they are selling.whilst you are able to buy double the isk from a gold selling site for only a few pounds more then the temptation for people to buy it will always be there.if ccp introduce measure which mean the gold selling site have to increase the cost of their isk then the temptation for players to buy it decreases. if less people buy isk from gold sellers and switch to ccp.the goal would be to instead of being able to buy double the isk, it would be more or less equal in cost to buying the isk via ccp."
5/20/2010,"i agree with you very much dr. battlesmith with regards to the meta 0 changes in tyrannis. my interpretation of the dev blog is that ccp more than likely created a mechanism to manage the drop rate rather than a one-time fix. perhaps going forward they will have the ability to manage the basket using this method instead of letting insurance be the sole method of setting the floor on mineral prices (as some hypothesize). its all speculation, but leave your thoughts on that in the s&i or md forums, plenty of people have opinions. as it relates to our macro-miner discussion, in a hypothetical, a net increase in mineral prices (especially empire) only makes it more lucrative for the macro user and therefore i dont think the near term function was designed with the macro miner or rmt in mind. however looking at long term effects this meta 0 drop rate tool, (if it exists) would allow ccp to come in with an effective macro miner elimination process where the drop rate could then be increased (if only temporarily) to counter potential hyper-inflation created by the removal of a large portion of the macro miner account base. perhaps this could be the infrastructure needed to come in with an effective solution to solve the problem while keeping the market stable. (something for us to think about and maybe ccp already has??? )i do agree that rmt is an issue in the game, ccp made great strides with the addition of plex. but limited sweeps, reporting potential macros are not solving the problem. i see a guy named disco biscuit in the ice field i hit in empire 24/7, ive reported him but hes still sitting a couple roids down from me right now. i can name 6 or 7 more sitting here right now as well. im not mad about it, i simply look at it as a business problem that hasnt gotten funding, finished development or the resources arent available to address it. i dont think making it less tedious is the solution, null sec mining is far from tedious, you got mining+rats+watching local, and as someone whos paid the price for lack of attention on while mining in null sec, i prefer it if ccp didnt add any additional layers to my mining efforts. im not a programmer but i have a hard time understanding how ccp could make a change to empire mining that wouldnt effect null sec mining as well. i see a lot of people getting their panties in a bunch in this thread, i wouldnt be surprised to see this thread getting picked up by the people who sell the macros and theyre contacting their users telling them to come in here and flame it down. but the reality is a tough pill to swallow, a client side solution like warden is probably the most cost effective way to solve the problem.java[edited to included hyperlink to dev blog]"
5/20/2010,"is this against the eula? disturbing, yes. bordering on insane, yes. macros, no. sanctioned as legit by the gms? indeed it was."
5/20/2010,"yeah but the thing is that you can still make a vicious afk cloaker out of things like tech threes. when i used to live in scalding pass there was a death or glory guy who would drop his alt into the one ice system we have and just sit afk while doing crap on his mains. then he would come back and pop our hulks all the time, since he was already at the ice belt afk all the time he could just decloak, shoot the hulks, then warp and recloak, and if we got lucky he would just laugh at our hic bubbles to try and hold his stabbed tengu in place. it gets rediculous when one ship can be invincible like that."
5/20/2010,it is not the afk cloakers you need to be worried about. it is the ones who are not afk...
5/20/2010,"yeah thats what i'm saying. if the guy was just sitting in system all day afk i wouldn't care. its when he can attack and run like that is the issue that i see. even someone thats afk 23 hours then burns a cyno and titan bridges friends in is more ok then the one uncatchable t3. cause he will be held in place so i can finally kill him, and i have his friends to kill instead of just getting griefed."
5/20/2010,"cloakers who aren't afk aren't going to sit around and wait for someone to scan them out. in fact, they are likely to be constantly wandering belts and gates, looking for something to kill. even if you could probe out cloakers, you wouldn't find them."
5/20/2010,not supported.
5/20/2010,"yes but that means that as you stated they arent afk and will eventually get bored and leave. its still a step up for when someone sits in your system for five hours. then ganks someone, then can keep sitting in your system for longer, and gank someone again. specially if you were like we were before gent club wanted our space to rent it out to poeple and only lifed out of pos. you couldn't even hide in stations like gc carebears can when mr cloaky red comes along."
5/20/2010,"you know there are a few simple rules that make you much harder to kill or atleast get a shot on killing the the cloaky aswell. like e.g. ratting in groups of 2-3, fitting rr, neuts and tackle on your ratting ships. if you want to rat solo ... stay aligned all the time so you can warp out instantly.(oh and kill scrambling frigs early). dont shoot the obvious bait falcon/arazu if you arent sure you can kill him before his friends bridged in and tackled you.his cloak is his pos, he sits in it and waits for you to make a move. same way you sit in your pos and wait for him to make a move if you are scared.if you could probe out cloakers, why would you fly relatively lightly tanked ships (especially under neut)? and for all non covert ships ... if you think they dont have enough penalties ... i would ask you to check again for the scan res, sensor recalibration and speed penalties.all it would need is a bit adaption of your play style and you would be fine again. but it is easier to ask for a nerf am i right?adapt or die - in which part are you better?p.s.: would you trade a ""find the cloaker"" probes for a module that kicks you out of pos so i can kill you without all the boring waiting?p.p.s.: wh local for all normal 0.0 please!"
5/20/2010,you realize that wh local defeats the purpose of having a cloak right? and in the cases like section xiii they just come and kill your pos so you can't hide in it any more. theres no option like that with your cloak. and like i said. he only goes after the makis and hulks. the guy has 0 intrest in taking any fight that will give him any chance of getting caught and dying. the oh have five people sit around protecting the makinaws is a waste of resources as those characters could be mining for pos ice in their own makinaws or out ratting to buy the other npc goods since we had mil five in there too. but one cloaky tengu made it so we not only would lose 100-150 million defenseless ships but 100s of millions sitting to protect them as the time to decloak + shoot off a couple thousand hp is lot less then it takes for my pvpish mega to warp 40 au from my plexes to the ice belt.
5/20/2010,no wh local doesnt defeat the purpose of cloaks. because smart people still use their directional scanner and see you coming. but nice try :)
5/20/2010,"because you know. the two months that i lived in a wh i spammed my dscan every two seconds i was logged on. also i noticed you didnt argue my last post about why having the ability to cloak for as long as you want to get them to burn hundreds of millions of isk (edit) not ratting, or rat and lose hundreds of millions of isk in exhumer losses (edit) did not get rebutted. does that mean you secretly agree with me that a cloak like tha is broken overpowered? so to you sir, nice try :)"
5/20/2010,"it isnt my fault you do unprotected mining ops isnt it? ever considered parking with some cloaked recons around your mack and wait for him to do a move?if he had the patience to wait until you left your mining ships unprotected in a belt, he deserved the kill and you deserved the loss. he seems to be smarter than you."
5/20/2010,"its not that he has the patience though. we know from watching logins and logoffs of the other people in his corp that he has three other accounts. (you can tell when four people log on and off within seconds of eachother every time.) so its not like he was not doing anything at all, he was prolly happily ratting with blues in russian space with his other three acounts. its not like a guy with only one account wanting to ice mine and cant protect himself like i can with my four.also a heavy missile cloaky tengu can shoot around eighy km or so. have fun pointing that unless you have your paper faction point with gang bonuses running arazualso im posting with my main so you can look me up and see that i actually live in 0.0, your afraid to post with yours i guess as you are posting with a trader corp alt whos office is in jita 4-4."
5/20/2010,"i do think that someone being able to park a cloaked alt in a hostile system indefinately while being completely afk should be addressed. a high-skill-required probe with a long (say a minute) scan time could work. it would require the cloaky pilot to at least pay attention, rather than cloaking up and then either playing on a different account or going afk entirely.another solution would be to make cloaks take charges, like a cap booster. that way at least the pilot would have to leave once in a while to get more, and expose himself to being caught in the process.either way, being afk for days at a time and making your targets have to guess whether you're actually there or not shouldn't be a tactic."
5/20/2010,"this ship is bull****, compared to the other commands it really needs some love and fastso i purpose the following changes to actually make it worth using or training for.firstly it needs an extra low slot or more power, so it can become a decent buffer, ofc if you give it an extra lowslot it would need more power at least 200 more.ok now on the links, i always found it odd how the gallente command gave bonuses to ew out of all things :s these arent all that great when compared to the other commands.i say introduce drone link modules and the three to be introduce are.1. increases damage of drones2. increases hitpoints of drones3. increases tracking / op of dronesthe actual skill 'information warfare' shouldnt increase targeting range but instead the speed of drones.i am working on % here but i feel the eos being gallente should really benefit drones, the other commands can greatly benefit their race but the eos is the odd one out.anyway i am open to suggestions on what needs to be done, i also think the claymore could do with a bit more cpu but thats a different story xd"
5/20/2010,"the use of salvage drones would already be a sacrifice. you're giving up the opportunity to use other drones. if you choose to pull your hobgoblins and put out your salvage drones, isn't that a compromise?but then people will argue that the dominix has an advantage - but the dominix only has 6 high slots, because of it's massive drone bay. the myrmidon, again has less high slots than your average bc. the vexor, same deal. even the lowly helios, the only covops that has drone capacity, sacrifices a high slot compared to the other covert ops frigates. (wouldn't that be a nice little ship with a salvage drone in it, but i digress) the ships are already balanced, the drone bays are balanced against the number of high slots, capacitor, grid and cpu. arguing that getting salvage drones allows you to do something without giving up something else is plainly wrong."
5/20/2010,"one way of looking at is is that scamming is trade piracy, and we all like piracy as a part of the game - right?"
5/20/2010,"you're a scammer. there: now everyone knows, you scammer. daj mahal is a scammer!daj mahal is a scammer!daj mahal is a scammer!"
5/20/2010,"as long as there is no limit to the ""ignored contract issuer"" list, this isn't needed."
5/20/2010,"capital armor rr is so much more preferred that chimeras (which get shield rr bonuses, not armor rr) are flown with armor rr fitted."
5/20/2010,"any sovereignty system that is based on massive dps overcoming massive hp is going to devolve into lag fests and boring grinds of one kind or another. sov shouldn't be based on shooting structures according to set timers at all.you can change the names and shapes of the toys on the field all you like, but until the underlying premise changes, it'll still suck in just about the same way, and the bigger the blobs get, the more hp they have to introduce to counter the dps."
5/20/2010,too many times does a gang puss out and deagress and remote repair each other then jump out to avoid a fight when the fight is no longer going in their way.have remote repairing someone count as aggression!!!
5/20/2010,no.next idiotic topic?
5/20/2010,i guess the badger had remote repairs on it?
5/20/2010,"so i think i've figured out emo's game plan here. build up a reputation as a troll, propose something eminently reasonable, and watch people reflexively speak out against it. congrats, i think you were just meta-trolled. good ideas are good ideas, even when proposed by a...whatever the hell emo is."
5/20/2010,well it isnt like the topic is new. and tbh ... he should start using proper style and not the all caps bold crap all the time.
5/20/2010,"i heard you like, lost a dramiel to a badger bro."
5/20/2010,supported.+1
5/20/2010,no-one takes you seriously mate
5/20/2010,"oh noes, did a 100 man rr bs gang managed to survive your 250 man blob of some sorts?.now that's some epic crying right there if that's the case.remote reps are totally fine as they are now. nothing more is needed to say about this case.and yeah, no one will ever take you seriously after this.hahah, that's soooooo funny to link in every topics made by emo tj."
5/20/2010,ffs with writing in caps and bold
5/20/2010,"not only does emo tj lose dramiels to badgers, he also slow boats noob ships then loses his pod. for those who didn't believe he lost the dramiel to a drake, it is api verified.remote reps shouldn't be able to be run until the second a person jumps. they also shouldn't have a full aggression timer like shooting someone, or logistics ships would get creamed on gates as they have less buffer than the ships they are repping."
5/20/2010,"remote reps are fine as they are. it's just another variable in gang composition and tactics that makes the pvp game more varied, and fun, and it's fairly well balanced as is, since you have to give up some dps and/or range for the ability to rep. everyone's aggression timer is the same. it's not as if you can't de-aggress too and jump after the gang you're shooting, or just bracket the gate in the first place.it works the way it is. leave it."
5/20/2010,"i only have 1 issue with the events and thats not the kms (will get to that in a second) my issue is with the concord (player) ships:ok they are godly (and i have seen one case of dev hax system jumping) whilst scramed and webbed/nuted to nothing,the other half of this is rr, the concord ship is a player ship (with respect to the fact that is looks like anyother player on the grid) now i am agressed and so is he, yet the peeps rring him are not flagged to me, (y is this),anyhoo on to the kms i like em and i would like to see kms issued for officer spawns also"
5/20/2010,"they already do. you don't think i'm the only person in 0.0 that figured this out? almost everyone in 0.0 farms datacores for extra isk. 50+m isk per month is enough to cover the cost of replacing ships unless you have a bad month. many have several alts on the same account that also churn datacores, making that 150+m per month (per account). now that's noticeable passive income."
5/20/2010,that wont even replace a t2 cruiser. its not even close to noticeable!
5/20/2010,so i guess that we are going to leave out the fact that these moons are used in quite a high percentage of the reactions needed to make most t2 stuff and that the people that control the moons also control the market on that one eh?
5/20/2010,"a complete monopoly on those moon minerals. you can't, say, make prometium or dysprosium with moon minerals found in low sec? technetium, on the other hand... well, you can see why the southern alliances attacked the northern alliances.sure, the big alliances have t2 bpos which allow them extra margin, somewhere in the 20-30% range, compared to someone with 2-3 accounts running r&d agents to manufacture t2 through invention in high sec, buying moon minerals off the market. again, you forget the complete lack of risk that the person (me) has compared to the 0.0 alliance who has to protect the moons and stations. i can just pull datacores, invent, then manufacture. all in empire space. alternately, for even less risk, i can sell off the datacores for a couple hundred million isk a month.completely safe.completely passive.it is impossible to block someone from making this income."
5/20/2010,"the vast majority of the promo (7-9) and dyso (6 of 14) moons in low sec are all located in aridia, which is owned by none other then it alliance. i live in providince now and scalding pass before gc evicted evicted us. i know that sc wants the nc moons and why."
5/20/2010,"this mechanic is not penalizing the person with the low sec status. the person with low sec status doesn't have gcc. the person repping them gets gcc. this is a penalty for logistics ships in low sec, not pirates."
5/20/2010,"sorry for the necro, but supported"
5/20/2010,"already available from someone other than ccp. why should ccp pay the extra costs to implement and power this when someone else is doing it for free. i would rather them spend that time, money and effort into implementing a forums feature that is not available, notifications of replies to your posts.that or just ignoring improvements to the forums as a whole and working on the game."
5/20/2010,"my first impulse to this idea is to agree, it sounds nice.but then i realize that if this is done then there will be less highsec pvp thus i think it is bad.also this will make things harder for newbies who try instigating pvp that is also not good.however no insurance for ships killed by concord is something that merits proper discussion."
5/20/2010,"i sorely miss a rig that increases drone damage (i know there is the ""sentry damage augmentor"" already), but a high-slot solution is acceptable aswell. i'm not a regular user of gallente ships, so my experience is lacking. the way i see gallente drone-boats is that they don't use drones as ""launch and forget"" weapons as other races would. so drone speed, damage and damage resistance are important for them. i'd love to be able to fit an imicus that can actually be useful, but the only drone attributes i can influence is their warp-speed, tracking, range and durability (forgot this one in my initial post, heh). if i lose my drones, i lose all my weapons. i have to wait for my drones to get to the target (or back to my ship when i break off an attack), i have to stick around longer and still my drones are just as vulnerable then when i used a minmatar ship (despite the drones being my main weapon system on a gallente ship). i'm not sure how many gallente ships are affected by this problem.edit2: maybe one final consideration. turrets do more damage close-up and less at range. would it make sense to reduce drone control range as you raise drone damage ? for example 15% more damage mod would reduce drone control range by 15km."
5/20/2010,"full results can now be read in this dev blog.hi,as i mentioned here, we will not be releasing the list of who won the election until the 26th. this is so that we do not interfere with the currently sitting csm, as the elections were called early for the purpose of sorting travel arrangements for the first csm-ccp summit of csm5.i can however provide some stats. i'll add a little to this later on today:39,433 votes were cast, compared to 21,787 for csm4of these votes, 754 voters abstained and 38,679 were for candidatesthe turnout for the election was 12.67%some wonderful graphs of times that votes were cast, first votes per day:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.and votes per hour of the day:please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
5/20/2010,that is a large increase in voter turnout!it will be interesting to see how far that changes the cutoff point for getting elected...
5/20/2010,"it has been an interesting ride indeed, much more active involvements (as opposed to just campaign statements), much more debate, and quite a bit more exposure.stakeholder element does up the ante here, it redefines the stage, just beware that can cut in more then one direction"
5/20/2010,"it is just an epic failure that the first days of voting there was displayed a static list of candidates.we filed the importance of the problem about the advantage that one have that is listed on top of that list and yet the change wasn't made in time.personally i won't jump on the bandwagon concerning ankh, i have no problem with her and she was ok to work with while i was in csm-2.but i'll tell you that ankh will have 2500 extra votes due to this epic failure of a static list of candidates./x"
5/20/2010,"it's great to see nearly twice the number of votes cast this time compared to last. i'm sure a little controversy, more active involvement of the community, stakeholder status going forward, ccp's increased communications all helped. plus csm4's and teadaze's excellent efforts to keep us informed of their work contributed to the overall credibility of csm...that surely contributed to voter turnout.thanks for sharing these numbers early."
5/20/2010,"was a nice run this once, tiresome, but nice.lots of known names running...good luck to everyone"
5/20/2010,i think the frequent login screen ads about the csm also greatly added to the voter turn out - good to see the number's finally rising :)btw this thread needs more blue graphs
5/20/2010,"indeed, that's a 65% increase in turnout over the average of all previous elections! it will definitely be interesting to see the cutoff numbers this round, especially seeing as mm is doing their split tactical voting... vuk lau could have garned two spots just for himself in each past election he participated in, so he took advantage of that by adding a running-mate; will bump someone else down.while i was running, i put together a quick spreadsheet of the previous data based on ccp diagoras' devblogs past, and did a projection of csm5 based solely on an average of past numbers. i've adjusted up 65% to match the total actual votes this round. it's obviously going to be different if the tactical bloc voting does happen, but it gets the brain going nontheless. if you're interested, here's a url link to a jpeg of the statistics:"
5/20/2010,"nice blue graphs, i also have some here :) my website had estimated 1,300 as the cut off also, but with less maths involved in my calculations. which kinda sucks as my website estimates votes for t'amber @ 885 on another note, i'd like to think it was the calibre of candidates that raised the voting percentage, but the more likely cause was all the trolling. lets hope theres some drahma and not just a show of block voting force and karmic balancing. -t'amber"

5/20/2010,the seats for alternate are very expensive this year it seems
5/20/2010,"it has been interesting and a lot of fun and may i add my congratulations to those who won and good luck with your work sitting on the csm.somehow i don't think i made it to that list, would be nice to put some names to those numbers. when do those lucky few get to know if they won a seat, or is that all on the 26th, going to be a long wait if it is ."
5/20/2010,"awesome thanks for the extra information. an updated table with new numbers added, including a trendline, with comparison to my projected:"
5/20/2010,alright so who else got the email?? lolx
5/20/2010,"very impressive rise in the turnout, but if i am not completly misstaken or understanding something wrong, that equals about 311k accounts. haven't we been at 350k by the time of apocrypha? or was that just the number including trials accounts?"
5/20/2010,tease!-t'amber
5/20/2010,"damn, that is a lot of votes. so long cautious optimism o/"
5/20/2010,"accounts eligible to vote were active paying, non-ccp/volunteer accounts older than 30 days. this number totalled 311,193."
5/20/2010,lols nvm. -t'amber

5/20/2010,"what we need is ""chicago politics"" i.e. the ability buy proxies and vote the dead...imagine that election... 125% voter turnout! tribe(towel supplicant)"
5/20/2010,the chicago motto is: vote early and often.
5/20/2010,"ah, the 'don't compare a game to rl whine'. what a surprise...comparing it to any rl situation is of course not needed to know how stupid it is to say that victims are accountable for being victims. the agressor is always the one who is 100% accountable for his own actions, unless you want to claim that you are mentally unstable and the voices make you attack ppl. there is no way you can go around that. the fact that someone is carrying a t2 bpo in a shuttle on afk autopilot does not force you to shoot at him for example.... that being said, you would have to be a 'bit careless' to haul t2 bpo's in a shuttle on afk."
5/20/2010,"while the victim isnt at fault for being shot, the victim is at fault for the measure in which his loss affects him.if you pack all your belongings in a hauler and get shot, its your fault that you lost everything: you chose to take the risk of putting all your stuff in one easily shot pinata.a smart player doesn't have to lose much of his total worth at all even if he gets shot."
5/20/2010,"it is good for them. one should learn something from every ship loss.you're equating ""painful"" with ""harmful"". i've lost plenty of ships because i was dumb or just plain ignorant. each loss taught me to be smarter or encouraged me to learn what i needed to know not to lose another ship in that way. therefore i became better at playing eve, and consequently lost fewer ships.but perhaps i should have just cried and whined about how mean and unfair it was that the big nasty bullies hurt my wittle feelings? and refused to learn anything? and blamed everyone but myself for my own stupidity and ignorance?"
5/20/2010,pretty much sums it up tbqfh - good post.
5/20/2010,of course you can learn from your mistakes. but that was not my point in this case. my point was that it will be very hard to convince ppl that getting blown up is good for them.
5/20/2010,"of course it's bad for you. but if you're smart, you learn something from it, and it helps you not get blown up again. alternatively, you cry about it, play the victim. you're only a victim in eve if you choose to be a victim. if i'm trying to pirate someone and get killed, am i a victim? not really, no. the only way to be a victim is to be 100% harmless and 100% careless. in fact, there are no victims in eve. you sign up to play, you sign up for a competitive game. you'll notice that i don't sign up for a boxing tournament and complain when i get punched. so, yeah. if you let me shoot your ship full of bpos, it's your fault. in this setting, no one would pass up a few billion isk off of a flying pinata. you're confusing ""i take advantage of your tactical mistake, destroy your base, and win the game"" with ""i raid your city, murder actual people (who don't respawn), and destroy the way of life of thousands."" it's a video game. you're not a victim. if you think you're a victim you're pathetic. so i was playing team fortress 2 the other day and i shot somebody. i must be mentally unstable for fighting other players in a game about fighting other players."
5/20/2010,"well my point is that it isn't hard to convince some people. and, oddly enough, those people are the ones who aren't crying for more protection, for the devs to save them, and the ones are aren't arguing for their own helplessness.the only ""boost"" that people like ankh and the people that she claims to represent really need is for people to stop telling them how helpless they are and for them to stop believing that they're helpless. as soon as they start believing that they can save themselves - and that only they can save themselves - why then they wont need saving at all."
5/20/2010,"this. the inferiority complex makes me sad. ""i have all the tools you do, but feel you need severe handicaps to make it fair for me. and, despite said handicaps, i still feel i can't possibly stand a chance against you."" defending yourself in eve doesn't take amazing ninja keyboard skills. just a little planning and some basic knowledge. it's not that it's so difficult that we feel hardcore for being able to do it, it's that it's so simple that we can't possibly understand how other people are incapable. helplessness is an attitude in eve, you're never really helpless..."
5/20/2010,"i'm looking forward to seeing election results but meanwhile, i just want to thank everyone for their support and votes!"
5/20/2010,"election is over, hope you'll make it, just letting you know you've been getting our lowsec votes :)"
5/20/2010,mynxee! elections are over.. can't hardly stand waiting for the results! i seriously hope you're gonna be represnting us.keeping my fingers crossed!love ya' missed ya' (no worries reloading now)tribe(towel supplicant)
5/20/2010,"/me does the hoping for a best ever csm!seriously, thanks tons to everyone that took the time to find a candidate and vote, or even voted abstain, your position is important for ccp to see as well.issler dainzeenjoying her post election party and cake!"
5/20/2010,you're not very easy to like to me.
5/20/2010,"a big thank-you to everyone who participated in the csm elections -- the voters, the correspondents (both public and private), and the other candidates.win or lose, participating in the elections has enriched my eve experience.best,trebor"
5/20/2010,"t2 fofs really should exist, they were just likely forgotten about. warp disrupting effect would be hilarious but increased damage at the cost of max velocity/sig/something is fine too.also, thank you everyone for the support and feedback. all we have to do now is ~believe~ for 9 days"
5/20/2010,"hilarious, but fun! also it's worth investigating why did they remove faction fofs from lp stores. i'm pretty sure they could set those back."
5/20/2010,will you be pushing for a rebalance re belt rats vs anomaly?
5/20/2010,"will you be pushing ccp to release more detailed information in patch notes? i have seen them link to a blog by a developer and post videos on youtube, but these seem like things that should be done, in addition to releasing detailed information on what is changing in them game."
5/20/2010,i don't
5/20/2010,"no, working as intended. belts are free for all and juicy anomalies require system upgrades. lack of documentation is known problem of eve. as a person, who follows changes introduces in various patches pretty closely, i'll support anything, that can improve current situation.i hope, you have voted for ankh then? anyway, voting is closed now. people who have voted for me, thanks for your support. as ccp have stated, results will be available on may 26th."
5/20/2010,"first things first, i'll say i'm quite impressed by what you present here, particularly as a first-time candidate. you cover many bases, and i enjoy most of what i read and see. though i know it is fairly late, can i try to pose a quick question? as one who is particularly fond of lowsec, can i inquire as to why you feel the need for the existence of bubbles/bombs usable there? i personally agree with the latter, but the former i personally would disagree with. beyond that, i'm glad to see what i see, without doubt."
5/20/2010,"thanks for your comments and question much appreciated.the bubbles and bombs issue is something i have picked up from talking to people, and is just something i want to discuss on their behalf. i personally have no issue with the use of bombs in low sec, i don't see it necessarily going to change gate camps significantly in low sec. however i do see bubbles as a double edged sword i don't want to every gate in low sec covered in bubbles, because that would achieve nothing, however discussion around allowing interdictor bubble or heavy interdictors to use their bubbles is something that can be explored. i hope that answers your question"
5/20/2010,"the idea behind csm is quite good. having a group of dedicated players appointed by the playerbase to work closely with ccp is theoretically quite good, and could in an ideal world be quite an asset to the game we all love!however, lately i have seen more and more people running for csm ""for fun"" or as a joke. not many, but a few! they acts like joke and plays like joke on the forums, with no real interest in making the game better, but instead see this as an opportunity to brag or having a good paid vacation in iceland. or, that is how it looks like for me anyway! because when i read the list of candidates and compares it to their forum posts in general - i am getting worried! not just for the candidate as such, but more of the playerbase who seems to like the idea of voting on such people for fun! so a question arises :what if a candidate turns out to be a total fraud, with no apparent interest in working for the betternes of the game. do ccp have a whip under the table? and what does it say about a playerbase who openly vote for such candidates for fun? or am i just being too judging here?"
5/20/2010,"most of the joke candidates don't come anywhere close to getting elected. there's only been three who have done anything particularly joke-like on the csm. larkonis trassler, who did a pretty dumb violation of the nda, got caught, and was removed from council. pattern clarc, who lost a vote on an issue he cared about and then disappeared never to be seen again(and who was eventually removed for non-attendance). and mazzilliu, who while often serious did things like raise an issue proposing to turn titans into monster trucks because someone gave her a plex to do it. none of them were ""joke candidates"", and while two of them did get removed for being stupid, they were all fairly genuinely trying to improve the game for most of the time that they were on the council. joke candidates exist. always have, always will. laugh and move on - they're not a threat to anything."
5/20/2010,"how would you suggest we detect the applicants who are secretly applying as a joke, with no intention of improving the game, but who seem involved enough to get votes?you also seem to have difficulty telling the difference between someone who has a sense of humour, and someone determined to undermine their csm position - ""for a joke"".i would be more worried about applicants who seem serious, but have the intention of undermining the csm, if that is possible. and in your case, i would be worried about suggesting that a player based vote is somehow detrimental to the choice of ""player representatives"".should we be given a choice of player representatives or should we be given them without a vote?""take care"" next time you make a post like this: your logic leaves a little to be desired."
5/20/2010,"i just want to be on the csm so i can put on my resume that i worked for ccp. since i was on the council of stellar managment that means it's both an elected position and a mangment position. and since there are 300k players or so, that means i am managing 300k players. and if i win this round that means i will get to say i worked for ccp for one and a half years. pretty sweet deal huh"
5/20/2010,i've never met anybody with so much management experience. please send me your cv if you're interested in being ceo of my multi-billion international company - i'm sure that with experience managing so many people you would be a top candidate
5/20/2010,"did i also mention that i'm the ceo of about six corporations and i'm a multi billionaire? i'm pretty much the most qualified person ever, you should probably give me ten jobs."
5/20/2010,"full results such as who won will not be published until the 26th. we had this scheduled for the 28th, however we have decided to pull that back a little. this is because the election was held early in order for us to be able to start sorting travel arrangements for csm5 for the june csm-ccp meeting and we don't want to interfere with the sitting csm too long before their term ends.i'll post up some basic information (total number of votes, maybe some other bits of info) in a sticked forum thread here tomorrow morning."
5/20/2010,thanks! you're fantastic for getting some information out to the drooling people who really wanna know!
5/20/2010,i'll buy you a nonni
5/20/2010,"you already did, not many show up for the meetings and xhagen started to ignore us"
5/20/2010,confirming i still haven't had a reply as to why the ccp csm4 summit minutes are now broken
5/20/2010,"big thanx to everyone who voted for us, and to everyone who voted in general."
5/20/2010,"if ccp has a muppetfilter, is this why nothing ever seems to get done?"

5/20/2010,thank you for everyone's support and good luck to all! -t'amber
5/20/2010,now lets hope ccp hurries with letting us know.ccp usually lets the winners know at least a few days in advance via email. so if you havent heard anything by the 27th its unlikely you made it in.good luck everyone!
5/20/2010,"in this thread ccp diagoras said the announcement date was moved to the 26th. he also promised some stats at some point today.hopefully we'll also get a blue graph from him, ccp diagoras loves blue graphs"
5/20/2010,filthy lies. i was framed! working on information at the moment.
5/20/2010,"one thing is certain, your blue graphs won't ever find themselves in a frame ;-)"
5/20/2010,i will personally frame diagoras erm blue graphs and give them to xhagen to put on the wall :p
5/20/2010,"getting ccp to release any in depth documentation about any of the features they are implementing would be nice, will you be pushing for this?"
5/21/2010,"my idea of pimping the bobs are quite different and not thought completely thru. they might not be thought on all sides of the coin, so if they are crap, do kill me (ingame) in horrible flames of death ;)- give them the allready earlier discussed cloacky bubble with slight implemention. let the bubble cloak all uncloaked and uncloak all cloaked :) it would be a way to find cloakers. easy, just fly randomly thru a system with afk cloaker until you find it ;-) the cloaky bubble has few problems i were unable to find a satifying solution. a) if the bubble is 20km and there are 10 ships inside it, how to prevent uncloaking each other, or would it be ok to crash and still remain cloacked if inside bubble? b) if somebody is targetted, would it still cloak him? c) the size of the bubble? 5km, 15km, 55km? d) should it need fuel?- give them a aoe weapon, maybe as simple as let them fit bomb launcher? maybe new kind of bombs to bobs usage only? a bomb that is immune to sb bombs, but not to other bobs bombs? so that in a regular sb bombage, you could get one bomb more shot.- it really needs to be able to fit warfare links. as for now a cloacky sneaky gang is getting deacent gang bonuses only, if there is a skilled enough t3 pilot abroad, and frankly, quite often those t3's are fitted to something completely else (i may be wrong here, but doesn't the covert reconfiguration sub go to same slot as the one that makes warfarelink usage possible?). there could be created a bunch (three) new warfare links designed to covert usage. ... erh. ok the minmatar links are pretty awesome to sb gang already :p speed, sig radius and propulsion jamming range. they really dont need anything else :) should be so, that a bobs giving fleet bonuses works only on a ship where is fitted covert cloaking device.- give the bobs the covert cloak- do not give the bobs more hp/resists/dps. leave it as it is, but give it some useful things, like those warfare links or the cloaky bubble.- give them increased fuel bay, so that it actually can ""roam"" around without a bunch of transport alts, but do not lower the fuel usage.- also increase slightly the jump range. not too much, but so, that it would be a little more useful.these were my thoughts of the black ops battle ship pimpages. i know there may be some, that are technically impossible or it would ruin gamebalance completely, but as i have no experience flying a bobs, only been jumped by one few times, so these are the things i realized. also i think that in place of increased dps/tank it should be given some more unique bonuses that fits into its role better.ugly eric"
5/21/2010,"simple the blasters need moar damage!!!!! you don't need more range,just more damage a perhaps better tracking and/or decrease signature resolution. blasters have more difficulty blaster smaller ships at their range vs autocannons and pulse lasers. i'd say we increase dps by 25-30%, which will reward the player for being able to close into the enemy. a mere 10-15% more than pulses or auto's makes it not worth trying to travel towards your enemy and take damage before you can deal damage to them."
5/21/2010,"heh. ccp has only itself to blame for the current mess. it decided projectiles needed a generic boost, apparently on the basis of some kind of comparison with lasers, while ignoring the characteristics of the ships that they were mounted on. that was stupid - the more important comparison is with blasters, as both minamtar and gallente ships are best used in solo/small-gang combat. so we got a projectile boost that undeservedly boosted minmatar ships that were already near the top of the pile - rifter, hurricane, vaga, etc. - while not really fixing the minmatar ships that actually did need a bit of help. so now we have minmatar ships that are faster, more agile and possess longer-ranged weapons than gallente, and, thanks to the importance of being able to choose damage types in small-scale fights, can often simply out-gank their gallente opponents at close-range as well. nice one, ccp. i'm not sure that overwhelmingly increasing blaster dps is the right way out here. doing that can make blasters overwhelmingly powerful in their niche - but i don't think that's good for the game. weapons should have an advantage in their niche, but it shouldn't be overwhelming, otherwise combat becomes more predictable and more boring."
5/21/2010,"i told you guys that it would be like that and i got flamed to hell and back because no, projectiles are bad and need moar, and some were claiming what ccp is doing is not enough because of scorch. actually i have to disagree with you on something, even the bad minmatar ships are solid now (well, ok, except the obvious trash which suffers from tier issues ala stabber and stuff). even the tempest is preety cool these days if you use it like a tier 3 battlecruiser and not a gank/tank battleship (i don't really do sniping).the previously bad ones are now actually rather passable and just fine, the previously good ones are just a bit too awesome because of a combination of ship stats and good weapons and so on. still, doing anything with them doesn't fix gallente in the slightest, because blasterboats already suck compared to amarr/caldari for everything (solo included tbh).blasters seem in many ways to be balanced around the state we had in 2007 when they were the ultimate closerange dps dealers and, for instance, the difficulty of fitting neutrons was there to offset their facemelting capability. then amarr got boosted multiple times, then minmatar got their boost, and so did caldari a bit previously (torps did, at least). the fact you cannot fit highest tier guns without fitting mods on any sub-bs t1 ship is now completely out of place (both minmatar and amarr can). active tank bonuses on sub-bs ships need to go the way of the dodo, really. utility high needs to be the norm even at the cost of just blatantly adding 1 more slot to some ships (what? cyclone has 1 more slot then brutix already). the guns themselves need a revisit - everything but neutrons has lol dps and **** range and is really useless, and even neutrons are a bit meh. i think a ship makeover alone with easier fitting would go a looong way."
5/21/2010,"first, it was obvious that something had to change, because there were really two ""tiers"" of weaponry - those that worked and those that didn't. there were plenty of arguments for bringing the overly awesome weapons down to earth, and plenty for boosting the overly sucky weapons up. ccp chose to boost the overly sucky weapons up. the end result was that projectiles are roughly balanced with missiles and lasers while hybrids are getting the shaft.this wasn't necessarily the wrong solution - merely an incomplete one.bite your tongue. there are ships which it works well on.-lianged: and gypsio, the only reason that people feel that minmatar was better at ""solo/small gang"" pvp was mostly because they were better at avoiding solo and small gang pvp. when you look at the vaga from the perspective of the cerb, it looks pretty damn overpowered for solo/small gang pvp. and to a point, you'd be right. but looking at the cerb from the perspective of a vaga in a gang with more than 2-3 people and the cerb starts to look pretty damn overpowered. this is not a problem.also, anyone looking to the hurricane as being better at solo/small gang pvp with the drake around is ****ing crazy. even after the projectile boost."
5/21/2010,"it doesn't work well on the brutix or the astarte because they need the speed and the damage mods and stuff. on paper it works on the myrmidon, particularly with drugs and stuff but tbh the typical way to die in a solo bc is to get (baited and) blobbed or die in a gang on gang fight, where in both situations nanoing it (particularly if you have snakes) is just much better, and you still kill the usual suspects.so while the rep bonus is somewhat useful sometimes, i'd argue there is a ton of bonuses the myrm could get which would be much much more useful because so many good setups don't use it at all.i guess they're ok on bs because tank scales much better then dps as you go up.but anyway, the rep bonus has nothing at all to do on turret ships which need damage mods to be useful."
5/21/2010,or the brutix and astarte need more lows.
5/21/2010,"and more fitting and stuff and so on.the thing is this; to get a credibleish active tank for a bc you need a minimum of 5 lowslots (2 reps, 2 eanms or eanm/exp hardener for astarte, dc), which leaves you with exactly 0 lowslots on the, say, brutix. which translates into ****poor dps by virtue of not fitting any damage mods. so let's add one extra lowslot (which would be good), ok, now you can have a magstab, but even if fitting got changed so you can in fact fit cap booster, neutrons, dual reps and mwd (which would be a huuuge fix for the brutix), we're talking about the difference between 735 dps for maxed 1 mfs brutix and 848 dps for maxed 2 mfs brutix (plated tank requires one low less), or 934 dps for 3-mfs shield brutix (which could then fit, eg. dual tes or te plus speed mod or stuff). sure, such a active armor brutix would be modestly useful for someone who does use drugs and have a fancy implant or two, but for it to really make sense the armor rep rig penalty needs to get changed to something other then speed (something irrelevant, preferably, and this should be done anyway). else when you combine the speed drop and the dps drop and so on between a shield buffer version and active armor version it's not really worth it for a lot of situations.on the other hand, it could live with a generically useful bonus like, eg. falloff. or anything gun related for that matter."
5/21/2010,rack of ions and 2x rep with 6 lows would be more than enough to bring a dual rep brutix in line with other ganky bcs.
5/21/2010,"active tanking bc don't make sense as long as you can get 1.52x more armor for just 6 mil worth of rigs. and the 1600mm plate is significantly better than armor rep.just calculate how long you need to active repair in order to break even with the plate on hp added - forget the cap requirements1600mm plate: 4200 hp, *1.25 from skill, *1.52 from rigs, total hp bonus: 7980medium armor repper: 320 hp over 9 sec (after skill), *1.375 hp ship bonus, *1.2 from combat booster, *1.41 from active boost rigs (stacking penalized), you get: 744.48 / 9 sec or 82.72 hp/sectherefore, to active repair 7980 you need 96 seconds and about 1715 capthis doesn't even include the added hp bonus from passive hp rigs to base ship armor, which for typical bc adds at least another 2000 hp, while active rigs get nothing like that.so in best case scenario, your active rep plays you your advantage if the battle duration is at least 100 seconds and you don't neuted. and you are willing to pay for boosters. with passive mode you get all those benefits upfront, not 100 seconds later. and if you are in a real pinch, you want those hp up front, or you die.thank's to ccp's carelessness with defensive rigs, making them vastly superior to offensive ones and making them ridiculously cheap, active armor rep has became near obsolete.since passive armor rigs are so advantages to have, they are nearly a must-have, and that means you have to sacrifice speed, at least 15% less speed.i suppose this is a rant for another topic. but the root of the problem is the same - ccp has incompetent game designers."
5/21/2010,"ions and 1 mfs? with ganky bcs? it does 700 dps, ffs, at hugging ranges. let's compare it to other stuff:- blaster myrmidon: 846 dps- hpl harb: does 823 dps, can fire all way to disruptor range- fmp/plated/2hs harb: 669 dps, again longer ranged- 3 mfs neutron brutix: 934 dps- ham drake: 719 dps w terror rage (usable vs bcs), 654 dps w cn terror, again longer ranged- 3 gyro 425mm ii 2 neut shiedfit hurricane: 763 dps w selectable damage types and much longer rangeso you do lower end (basically you outdamage fmp harb and cn terror drake) to gain a active tank which slows you down using weapons which have hugging range (this is sortof important) and that somehow is in line with those ships? i don't think so, tbh. if it could fit neutrons and if armor repair rigs didn't kill speed like they do (which in addition to bad range hurts you even more, since any ship above can preety much kite you with rig penalty in), then you might have a point but this way, no, not really.tbh, i wouldn't agree on armor rigs being a must (passive tanking, yes). for a ship like the brutix the killer really is the speed penalty (plus lower agility and speed because of plate anyway). it does 0 damage outside of scram range, so unless it's fast enough to have a good chance of getting there, no matter how much ehp you've stacked it's still useless. it really likes the shield amount rigs better, and you still gain 16k ehp more then rep fit. changing rep and resist rigs not to penalize speed (and leaving trimarks penalizing speed) would bring in some more balance between them."
5/21/2010,"but you can't make em drink...you're giving the ships extra effective modules slots, just as you can use the range bonus to tank as liang describes you use the lock range bonus for the same thing."
5/21/2010,would adjusting signature resolution of hybrids not make them more powerful yet unique and fit with their style of play? a long range weapon would generally be designed to be accurate at that range so a 10% or so reduction in signature resolution across the board combined with their traditionally crappy tracking would give them more powerful specialized roles based on a higher probability of getting better hits would it not?
5/21/2010,a signature resolution bonus *is* a tracking boost. there is no difference between the two.
5/21/2010,thats not exactly accurate. signature radius vs signature resolution is a much simplified version of weapons accuracy(there was a dev post on this but i can't find it). if you take a regular rifle and bench mount it the ammo will not hit the exact same spot every time its fired. this is eve's signature resolution.if you have a 1 foot diameter round target the closer you are to that target the easier it is to hit it as long as its not moving. get close enough and you are very likely to strike dead center very often. move it out 100 yards and if the rifle has a signature resolution of 1.25 feet @100 yards then it will miss the 1 foot diameter target 1/5 of the time regardless of the target moving or not.if i find the dev blog i will post it but it actually gave the above example showing shot patterns on round targets. this is partially why the theorized formula for gun tracking doesn't seem to work properly at long ranges. i would say this is a good guess as (limited) testing shows it to not function accurately but its on the eve wiki and i am not opposed to being wrong on this as it was a long time ago.
5/21/2010,"i like this idea, however there needs to be a disadvantage to using it, otherwise it would break game balance. their only means of offensive and nearly most of defense lies within the drones and the counter to that are things like destroying them with smartbombs or shooting them down. the fact that you could call them mid-battle into the bay and repair them, then drop them out again really makes those ships that much more powerful. it's much like creating ammo out of thin air for a battleship that has run low.it could be a module or perhaps cost capacitor or fuel/resource to use it for example. i just don't see the point of buffing an already powerful ship."
5/21/2010,bumping for prosperity
5/21/2010,"i've heard a lot of people complain about how boring the current sov system is with many reinforcement timers and a lot of waiting. in my opinion that's another good reason to change it to a system like this.say that you have exactly as many reinforcement timers as the system industry/military index. at index 1 there will only be a single reinforcement timer, meaning half as much waiting as today. but at index 5 it will be 5 reinforcement timers, pretty much impossible to break through, and very boring to even try."
5/21/2010,"i like this idea. leave the possibility to attack systems with the current cumbersome timers, but also allow to use this attrition warfare to lower timers or to make them more unpredictable. and to capture the system, you'll still need large fleet anyway. so, basicly, something to do for both large fleets and small gangs. win-win. really, really good idea. supported."
5/21/2010,very nice idea
5/21/2010,this.
5/21/2010,the general theory is sound. this is how 0.0 should have been operating in the first place.

5/21/2010,"that is the propaganda figures how about presenting the proper numbers complete with negatives for the voting public?50-100m/month per character using primarily mech.eng cores.each character needs a minimum 3-4 months skill training to get that amount.characters need to either grind the corporation standings or be in corp with requisite standings (i assume the latter).summary:ccp gets one year+ worth of subscription per account provided all three slots are used for this heinous act.player spends $210 in gtcs/subscription or roughly 4b isk in plexs to set each account up.account doesn't actually start making money until the investment is paid off (ie. 13-18 months in future).so as you all you lemmings can see the whole ""issue"" amounts to nothing more than a very convoluted way of buying isk - big whoop.obviously not supported since it is presented with critical data omitted, is not an actual problem, would screw over inventors and has actually made ccp a ton of cash.ps: no, i do not have alts all over with agents in place, i am not about to sacrifice 3-4 months training per character just so i can get what amounts to spare change for me somewhere down the road."
5/21/2010,yes.
5/21/2010,"i propose that a petition that covers the actions of a gm should not be put before the gm concerned to ensure that impartiality is maintained.a gm took an action against my character, i raised a petition to complain at the action of this gm as he quoted rules that i know don't exist.how ethical is it then for that same gm the complaint is about to be handling the petition? is it ethical for that petition class to even go near the gm's?the issue i raised was put before the same gm i was complaining about, i've never heard of any company regarding this as an ethical practice?my actual issue was just given the run around, how can any customer have confidence in a complaints procedure. prehaps ccp should drop it and add a bend over petition option?"
5/21/2010,"so far we can only sort our modules by type, quantity, name, and something else i never use. i'd like to suggest we be able to sort our stuff by meta level. i've wasted countless hours going through all the stuff in my hanger trying to find meta 4 modules to bring to market. it would make the game a bit less tedious if we could just find what we need when we need it instead of scrolling through an endless list of modules.this could be done quite easily by simply adding a meta column to the details or list display options of our items window."

5/21/2010,"form personal experience, i can confirm that high end shield tanking is vastly superior to high end armor tanking. about 2.5 times better.major reason for this is the difference between crystal and slave set. only shields benefit with 1.53x boost.secondary major advantage is cap usage. only shields get nearly 0.5x cap usage at same time as higher boost bonus. armor only gets boost bonus, no capthe problems are specific to high end gear. t2 stuff is pretty balanced.i support this thread only if t2 stuff is untouched."
5/21/2010,yes the real focus should be the high meta level armor reps. meta 5(t2) and low meta reps do not have such a vast difference in quality.

5/21/2010,"they were examples. the point is that the next expansion should work on fleshing out current content and not so much as adding anything new.perfection shouldn't be expected, but some actual :effort: in focusing the development to actually handling current issues might be needed."

5/21/2010,"info war links need to be looked at, active tanking is a gallente trait and just like the claymore it buffers ok. the idea of drone links is terrible"
5/21/2010,i always found it odd that the ew ganglinks are the gallante speciality.
5/21/2010,the eos is a support command ship. it can fit three warfare link mods. it's not meant to be tanking anything. it's meant to be behind the fleet with the logistics giving bonuses. if anything it should have the turret damage bonus replaced with armor hp or resists. if you wanna dps fly an astarte.
5/21/2010,this.it's like people want gallente to have two gank/tank cs (as they used to) and everyone else has a fleet cs and a field cs. doesn't make a lot of sense really.
5/21/2010,"you know, they might be looking that direction because its the entire combat philosophy of the race, and its not like info gang mods are useful in 99% of the situations people find themselves in. yes, you can occasionally use them. but its pretty damn rare tbh, even for an ewar heavy corp like mine.-liang"
5/21/2010,"no, the command ship without a eank -> primary -> dead commandship ->fleet with no commandship -> dead fleettherefore, it needs an adequate tank (which it does not have atm) and an adequate link bonus (which it does not have ether).and by the way, commandship is a support ship by definition. anyone care to explain why the hell does it have a bonus to drone-bay size and hybrid turret damage? that's two wasted bounces right there."
5/21/2010,"tbh if you primary a command ship you fail anyway, the tank isnt what bothers me, i can work with it as i said although if it was given a better powergrid then yeh that would be be greatthe links are bad.lets have this as an example, assume you have 4 members who each want to be a booster they fly (with perfect skills) damnation, vulture, claymore, eos. now the chances of picking the eos as the booster is practically zero, its like the fat kid at school who gets picked last because the popular rich kid (damnation) gets all the girls.anyway drone buffing seemed very gallente, dont see how that is a major thing tbh, amarr buff all things armor, caldari buff all things shield, minmatar buff all things pvp, having information links changed to benefit drones only wouldnt seem that op imo"

5/21/2010,totally against. no moar missioner boosts.where is that thumbs down button?(remove all lvl5s from high sec aswell)
5/21/2010,"i think the point here was that you could do the entire mission then salvage with drones. in that way u could just send out the drones instead of having a salvager+tractor on, so yea ur getting 2 high slots back which means faster missioning plus having drones to do the work for you. either way totally against."
5/21/2010,"i think that would be the better idea. salvaging drones where already discussed i think. the reason they where not introduced i don't know. but the disadvantages where bigger then the use. tractor drones could have maybe a different skill ""tractor range"". which is per skill level +8 km to the 20km tractor line of the ship. so lvl 5 would be a range of 60 km."
5/21/2010,"i agree that tractor drones are a better idea than salvage drone in order to keep things balanced. however, rather than giving them huge range on the tractor, give them bonuses to mwd speed and tractor speed per level. that way, the donre gets out the wreck, grabs it at say 8k and brings it back to your ship to be salvaged. have to have the bonus to tractor speed so the drone doesnt lose the tractor lock by going faster than than the tractor does."

5/21/2010,"i dont pvp but there is thing that ccp can do to make the game fun, and not so much like work.. and i have been on many ts and vent voise chat and all u here is how boared people are. i mine for the most part and do mission. and like i said i only play because of real life friends. if it was not for want to hang out with them online because we live so far apart. i would not be here/ or maybe we should just find another game that has more to it."
5/21/2010,get out of my head james
5/21/2010,"if you're playing eve and not enjoying eve, you really need to find a different game to play.eve does not have convenient pockets of fun interspersed with walking around. eve requires thought and decision making. you have to make your own fun - no one is going to hand it to you.unless of course you think having your ship exploded is fun, in which case there are lots of people who will be happy to bring you fun. you can find most of them in crime and punishment."

5/21/2010,we can create folders for bookmarks and in the people's/places interface? why not in the station's items hangar?industrialists tend to have way over 500+ different items stored at a single station.proposal:add a create folder option to items hangar.and yes i know that station vault's are available and the item search option.
5/21/2010,supporting my own thread
5/21/2010,"i'm really torn on this one... on the one hand the most common uses for this might be handy to keep things sorted, on the other hand most sorting can be done either through detail view, search function, or station containers. on the one hand, it would mean i wouldn't have to pay for station containers but on the other hand it would mean increased lag especially in busy systems.*alternate proposal: seed station containers for 10 isk and set npc buy orders for station containers at 5 isk and remove the whole repackaging delay thing. change station containers to simple containers instead of secure audited containers. we'd get the functionality of folders without the hassles currently associated with station containers."

5/21/2010,"remove titans from the burden that is placed on them by the wieght of everyone stating they are or should be the flag ships of eve, and give us a unique ship that is truly a flagship.please read the post here and post thoughts.still a work in progress but would help with and add to, alliance identities, role playing, and many other things in and about the world of eve!"
5/21/2010,"sounds like a good idea. honestly this concept is what i liked about swg, i just hated the rest of that game"

5/21/2010,"i agree alliances should have a flagship, a symbol to replace that of the titan-concept which was lost once titans became common.details arent that important, the meaning and pride an online community could have for a single vessel would be epic: a flagship titan-classed supercap which represents the alliance as a whole""+1 b"
5/21/2010,"i highly support this product and or service.srsly, having so many ships in the game that few people can remember wth they do would be awesome.lastly, why could this not be a t2 carrier/sc/titan? the models on those are fine, t2 is generally a role-specific ship, and there's already a precedent for limited t2 bpc/bpo availability."
5/21/2010,"sounds like an excessively complicated, unfeasible, and unnecessary ship, not supported."
5/21/2010,"i dont see a real purpose for the ship. also ... it either jams cynos or it lights them. not both at the same time. also aoe effects are bad, because the increase the server load quite a bit imho.(on the style ... normally you develop an idea in the f&i forum and then bring it up in the assembly hall. redirecting all discussion to the assembly hall isnt really nice.)"

5/21/2010,looks good brother.
5/21/2010,"the idea of removing the flagship role from titans and building it into a new ship, i like. your proposal, though, is just completely bizarre. it bears no resemblance to how ships actually work in eve. no thanks."
5/21/2010,confirming i will be flying the wi. tigerclaw.
5/21/2010,"datacores are usually spread a bit. 100 jumps to fetch them is not unusual.my idea is:right click on the agent with the research points in question. there is a function ""create contract"". in the contract you choose delivery. you tell how much research points worth the contract is. say a dc is worth 100 rp and you have 2000 rp in the journal. then the contract consist ""bringing datacores worth of 2000 rp to where ever"". the rp will be ""loaded"" in the contract. naturally you work with a collateral.the hauler gets the 20 datacores in a package and delivers them.that would save some people time and bring some people more hauling income. personally i would be perfectly ok to pay 3-5% delivering fee in order not to make the grand tour.what do you think? i dunno if you can open delivery packages. but with the collateral the ""theft"" would be ok as i would get at least the money. worst case i would need to buy the datacores with the collateral."
5/21/2010,supporting me of course :)
5/21/2010,"it would make far more sense if you could just talk to the agent remotely and get your datacores that way, and then courier them from there."
5/21/2010,this i'd support.
5/21/2010,"no, use a courier contract or get them yourself. you could just sell them in station as well. it's not like you cashing in daily anyway.ccp talked about having interbus operate as an npc courier service. this was several years ago and nothing have been done with it. i doubt they would add it for data cores.this is a better idea. even so, no hurry."
5/21/2010,did they mention current ships in the insurance changes? i don't know about you but i paid full insurance for my current ship so if there's gonna be a change we should get the current insurance until we die or at least get a percentage of our payment to the insurance company back.
5/21/2010,"you get neither. the contract is retroactively changed, no reimbursement. go wander around 0.0 for a while before tyrannis drops, see what you can do to get your money back out of it. it's far too late for the csm to do anything."

5/21/2010,"blobs exist in part atm because it's so ****ing impossible to attack someone in any sort of enjoyable campaign and expect results other than killmails. cyno jammers are a big part of the problem, when a defender can more easily online a new one and keep capitals in system while adding more through jump bridges. defenders get left with the problem of staging in system and fearing the **** cage effect, or leaving system with little chance of getting the jammer down again. hp on stations and pos make it even harder because they're so high, it virtually assures that an smaller organization will have to commit an entire day to one system, rather than have the capability of attacking multiple systems at once. this again benefits the defender because they can stagger timers.on top of it all, with insurance the way it is, there's no way to bleed wealth off an alliance simply by roaming systems. the point of these changes is to remove a lot of the defender advantages, and provide more opportunities to create fighting rather than the set timer affect. i would have included insurance, but slowly it appears ccp is getting their head out of the sand on that issue, even if they haven't got a clue how to fix it yet. as always, the biggest problem 0.0 faces is that it needs very hard changes and nobody is willing to sacrifice their own safety nets for the sake of the game. people want to be spoon fed, and the result is this **** hole ccp has created.i'm speaking as a recent defender of the north, that it was just way to easy, even if the attackers were a bunch of clueless gits."
5/21/2010,i fuel all my jump bridges with badger mk 2s.as far as i know you can not have the cyno gen and cyno jammer online at the same time. the really crap bit is that if you have a cyno gen mod installed in your hub and decided to put the cyno jammer in there you still get the 2 million a day bill forever and ever.
5/21/2010,"while your statement is true, it presupposes this was a good idea."
5/21/2010,i chuckle every time you make a fool of yourself.
5/21/2010,good example on someone that is crying.
5/21/2010,allthough i have no clue why it is necessary to write every comment capitalized i support the idea.external remote repper are supporting the enemy. therefore it is indirect aggression against the opponent.
5/21/2010,the bounty system is broken and needs some attention.
5/21/2010,man some of the suggestions on these forums are awfulnot supported!!
5/21/2010,"your missing the point of the post dude. it isnt ""is there a way to do (this)"" its ""id like an easyer way"" if i wanted reality in my games id just go on a real life killing spree. i play games because i want the fantasy of the game. i reiterate fantasy. secondly, i get your input but instead of stateing things like there the facts and your ccp law dog #1, why not state your opinion and leave the rule whipping to ccp employees. were here suggesting our ideas. that is how games like this evolve by player's suggestions."

5/21/2010,"a lot of those questions can be answered by simply checking out the eve wikieve wikicapital ships are barred from highsec for a reason, which was explained when ccp nerfed high-sec capital production. that includes the rorqual, which is explicitly designed for low/null sec. if you want a highsec rorqual, the best you're going to get is an orca, so stop complaining about it.compacting ore doesn't much matter for when you're refining it, just makes it easier to move than the original units...which can be fixed by just refining it as for moving your ships, invest in a freighter or do what everyone else does: move them manually.as for labs...pos stuff is explained in tons of detail all over the forum, on 3rd party sites, and on the wiki.do your homework before you complain about things...i...don't even know how to respond to that."
5/21/2010,"hay what if u dont get the best refine in the system u r mining and and want to trance port the ore back to were u have faction at for the best refine u can get would it not be nice to compact the ore so u can do this... and remeber this is fictanle game and ccp can change this if enough player request it so insted of saying it cant be done why not say please corect this and make my life ezyer it a game, fun should be the top pryority on the list."
5/21/2010,"ok i get that cap ships are banned for a reason, i understand why the roriqual was banned, didnt know about the 50% mining so i conciet that, kinadyan on the other hand i can no speak for. now about leaving a text marking on the ships banned from highsec, that is truily a good idea. it gives information that is important. ie: i would like to be a titan pilot, however i am not ready for lowsec, theirfore i dont want to be a fool and purchase everything for a titan and plan to run it in high sec, but before i found out that ships were limited in some cases to lowsec/nulsec i could have made that mestake. it took another more expeirenced player telling me how stupid i was to accualy make me seek information. also, some ships have special abilities like the roraqual's compacting, now untill the day before yesterday i didnt even know that you needed compaction blueprints to run the compaction...shouldent this information be readily availble in game for players? sure its in the wiki, and everybody should read the wiki ""cover to cover"" but you tell me honistaly that youve read the entire wiki and i have beach front properity in nevada for real cheep to sell the one who buys that. finnaly, for myself, moving my small ragtag band of ships i own is easy enough right now, i own an orca and can carry two of my other ships, making it down to running my orca and my bs seperatly. but if i may impose fantisy to your staunch reality a moment, what if you chould transport perhaps 4 battleships worth of rigged ships to a large fleet combat zone, prefitted and rigged for players, in your fleet so in the event they loose their current ship, then they warp to the het (heavy equpment transport) support ship and grab their backup. now you have a combat ready pilot in seconds rather than him having to go and totally refit a new ship, which can be vary time consuming. this can turn a battle in your favor quickly. that is the heart of the idea for having something bigger than an orca to hual ships. and to top that idea off, why not limit this het support ship to just hualing ships that are fitted and rigged, and yes perhaps that kind of power is better suited to being locked in lowsec, but its one hell of a good idea to think about now isnt it?"
5/21/2010,"and the cpp said unto the playerbase, ""why do you cry to me? tell the children of the eve gate to go forward.""""lift up high your rage, and stretch out your hand over the sea of tears and divide it. and the children of eden shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea of tears.""and this is how it happened.then karma stretched out her hand over the sea of tears; and the ccp caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind smelling slightly of sulphurish ash all thought the night , and made of the sea of tears into a dry land, and the peoples were divided."
5/21/2010,"it's great to see a much higher turnout than the previous csm, lets hope that the high level of interest in the csm's work continues through its lifetime.i'd just like to say best of luck to all the players who put their hat in the ring for this election. i can't imagine it must have been easy to come under such scrutiny from your fellow players and if your elected or not you can be proud of your contribution to the game."
5/21/2010,"well there's two things that increased turnout in these elections:1) openness from ccp. csm4 + ccp did a great job of making the process more transparent and the achievements more visible which has interested more people than before.2) old candidates being able to run again has caused for ferocious campaigning, hate, slander, and much other hilarity which again increased the 'media coverage' of the event and thereby the amount of people that voted.what needs to be done now is that csm5 and ccp continue to provide a detailed account of the process and what it leads to. there will always be bitter vets who simply think that the csm is useless, but much can be gained among the rest of the playerbase."
5/21/2010,a quick thought about the increased voting turnout.i was wondering how many players with multiple accounts only voted with one of them.personally i have multiple accounts but i don't like the idea of casting more than one vote as it dosen't seem democratic. i know its probbaly impossible to tell how many people voted more than once but its something to consider when looking at the voting statistics.
5/21/2010,"i think almost everyone with >1 account votes with each of them. you can see that by the comments of support throughout various candidates' threads. since there's no practical way of limiting votes by individual persons, doing it by authenticated (via login) account is the only realistic option. it doesn't make any sense not to cast all your allowed votes due to philosophical reasons. everyone else will be giving full support to their preferred candidates; you might as well do so, too -- next time around :).i miss your podcast"
5/21/2010,"i know a number of people with multiple accounts who split their votes between candidates they liked. of course there is a chance that splitting votes too much means none of your voted for candidates gets in, but that is the risk you take."
5/21/2010,"updated first post with:some wonderful graphs of times that votes were cast, first votes per day:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.and votes per hour of the day:please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
5/21/2010,"interesting, that really shines and interesting light on those first 3 days of mass trade hub spamming with direct links to vote for ankh, and the static order of the list with her on top? would be neat to find out if there is a relation there in the numbers.also: you broke the forum layout"
5/21/2010,that 3 days was also before the weekend.
5/21/2010,"at last we get the official blue graphs! excellent, though now i have to find something else to joke about"
5/21/2010,"another potential interesting graph to make?where the voters cast their vote (or where their clone is set to). 3 characters per account, but i guess you can go with the character that has the most sp.maybe post the difference between the votes of the candidates who got in vs the candidates who didn't as well. see if the claim that ""it's only 0.0 people who are interested in the csm is valid"".age of characters who abstained vs age of people who voted for someone would be interesting as well (to see if abstains are all ""bitter vets"")as far as the previous graphs go, the first 3 days don't correspond to ""spamming in local"", i think, i believe they correspond to the ""natural voter base"" of people. people who knew before the elections started who they'd vote for, while the rest of the days are people who got convinced to vote for this candidate or that one."
5/21/2010,"very interesting. this was something i wanted to see. i was not expecting to see such a large number of voters at the last minute.... and as i typed this i realized how dumb of an assumption that was. human beings always wait till the last minute for everything. still the number is significant. my interest is that it might be worth it to reduce the election time, or not. guess it does not matter much ether way. thanks for the graphs."
5/21/2010,"lot's of ppl seem to do that, considered it myself for a long time too.edit: oh, and yay \o/ on the increasing voter numbers."
5/21/2010,"cat wins and ankh loses or i will erupt another volcano, just saying"
5/21/2010,i'm not a 'her'. otherwise it is correct.
5/21/2010,"1260 for 9-th place... that a pretty competition... but i really hope that i haven't wasted my 4 votes (i have 4 accounts) and candidate for whom i voted will be in csm for 2nd time, especially considering really big help to russian community from him and his past achievements... (guess who i voted for. though it's pretty obvious and not hard to find out even if it isn't obvious)and about blue graphs. it is interesting that number of whats during dt is pretty higher then just befor dt and just after dt"
5/21/2010,"t'amber from a personal standpoint concerning your lottery i'm disappointed but also because your one of the better people in eve and you'd do a heck of a job as a primary. for whatever reason if your vote counter on that website is accurate your not even an alternate this time around. i can only assume powerblock voting is involved and i'm truly sorry to see that happen.the csm is inherently flawed by the overwhelming influence of mega alliances and powerblocks. unless ccp is willing do something to address this, more and more its going to become very clear that its a joke to even vote. while there was a spike in voting i believe that this was forced by the nc and sc conflict as people in both groups try to get their people on the council with the potential of affecting the war. i am sorry to see that my vote is inherently wasted."
5/21/2010,considering the actual results haven't been released i wouldn't cry mega alliance blob foul just yet.in csm4 only around 4 of the 9 delegates (or 6 of the 14 if you include the alternates) were from large alliances...
5/21/2010,there wasnt a full scale war on then like there is right now. increases the likely hood and the voterspike for me is cause for concern not joy.
5/21/2010,"breaking news! ankh openly said on a big dutch website she watches ****.. this should've come a few weeks earlier and gave you lots of votes. watch from 2:10, the rest is about her buddies at the pirate party (what's in a name ).click!so whats your favorite movie? gallente girls gone wild?"
5/21/2010,"so is it griefing if the entire community bands up to kill ankh if she somehow wins csm and tries to make eve into hello kitty adventure island? because i really, really want to do that. something with a catchy name...sorta like hulkageddon ii..ah. ankhegeddon."
5/21/2010,"i enjoy a cheap laugh as much as anyone, but seriously, you're going to make fun of someone for watching ****? it's so ubiquitous that even if someone specifically claims that they don't, i assume that they're lying. also, carebears gone wild isn't ****, it's a documentary about people who refuse to shoot other players, but decide to let their hair down every once in a while and fly tackle."
5/21/2010,"if i'd have voted, i would have voted for you."
5/21/2010,i wonder if natana's blindly fanatical ankh campaign (and hate campaign against me and others) had any influence on the results..
5/21/2010,"finnagain zero,1. above is someone else painting perhaps a more balanced picture compared to what you guys are saying.2. as for ankh's ideas. some ideas are in line with other csm on a scale of being moderate. her more 'appalling' ideas, ie the focus of much debate, is her representing her play style /viewpoint. contrary to your statements of ""she will ruin the game"" this ankh individual or any other single individual on csm does not wield enough power to make decisions on their own. even after the csm process, the developers ccp ( who have pretty good grasp of sandbox ) are not gonna jeopardize the various play styles with those kind of extreme ideas.in all likelyhood we might get her good ideas while the bad ideas will not get traction. 3. i rather have passionate candidates represent us then dead weight ( obviously our views differ )i ask you though, would you want someone representing pvp / 0.0 to turn out to be a lame duck ? would you want your candidate to dilute their message for the sake of appeasement ?4. ???? ps. i wonder if this hate campaign actually gave ankh more fodder to convince the carebears who would normally be apathetic.gg"
5/21/2010,"i sense some emorage here. relax ankh, your life wont be over just because you cant control eve. remember not to fly anything you cant afford to lose and seriously ankh, we all know its you. so just gubble it up and post with it. you only fool youself as usual."

5/21/2010,"i started the eve blog don quixote from space like a month ago, which i like updating once in a while. actually, it is easier to find a dead moment to write than to play eve. i was reading the programs of the different csm candidates with half an eye the other day, and i wrote something about it. i am posting it here since it belongs here, and its the only place it will probably get read by a few people.if i missed the ideas of some candidates, i apologize.and if someone else has other ideas for discouraging blob tactics, i would like to hear them.edit: i forgot to mention that in the blog article, i asked myself the question what my character would do if he would run for csm.. that is why i am talking about ""my own campaign headlines"". i am definitely not a csm candidate myself.general consensusone thing that struck me was the general consensus among the present candidates. eliminating lag seems to be on top of the general wishlist, while boosting small gang pvp/discouraging blob tactics, incentivizing low security space and building a better ui are all important seconds.some ideas about incentivizing low security space are as old as the conflict between the amarr and minmatar people. for example, since mining in low security is usually not as lucrative as it is in high security, while being a lot more dangerous, it has been obvious for ages that ccp should boost the mining there, like adding some 0.0 ores to them. some ideas are newer but yet remain simple which is always a good thing. like adding some pirate faction agents to low sec space, as paritybit seems to want. ui-wise, the best idea in my opinion, is the one trebor daehdoow has: to add addons to the eve interface. as i understand it, it comes down to players being able to highly customize their ui for the job at hand in game, by decorating the existing interface.i read about more interesting, less high scale, ideas too.like make it possible to sell kill rights. another one i found at paritybit. love that one!or for pve, the idea of ankhesentapemkah to make dynamic missions, i guess a bit like the random dungeons/bosses/subquests/drops the blizzard diablo games have. i am a fan, like most people, of making pve more like pvp too, for all the obvious reasons.and another point on which there is a lot of general consensus: do something about the exagerated insurance payouts of battleships. the cost right now to gank freighters and expensive mission ships in high security is ridiculously low."
5/21/2010,"my campaign headline: discouraging blob tactics as they are nowfor my campaign headlines, i started thinking about why i play eve. i see it less as a game to prove myself than some others do. i like just flying around in space, wandering from one side of the universe to the other, having just met a white-collar criminal, having flown through another solar system struck by anarchy, knowing some of my mining friends in nullsec just docked because their enemies came looking for them, some others are happily hunting pirates and another is somewhere moving his trade cargo between the hubs of the four empires. it is easy for me to get under hale's skin and feel a bit like i am actually there. i guess that makes me a roleplayer in disguise, but with eve, you at least roleplay your own unique character. it is not like you are doing the same quest thousands of others do on a daily basis. for thrall, or whatever his name may be.having said that, i would like the pvp to be a bit more engaging though. right now, you need 2 scouts and 1 good fc, and you are set for a 50ppl rr bs gang. i am simplifying things here, but only to make a point. there are too many grunts in fleets. and the impact of numbers negates the need for individual skill and game knowledge too much. i do not dislike huge fights. i dislike the way the fcs call primary after primary, flushing tons of game detail, individual skill and variety in shiptypes through the drain. some csm candidates propose ideas or entire solutions for this.one of the points in mynxee's program is discouraging blob tactics by removing some of their advantages, perhaps by subjecting fleets over a certain size to ""stacking penalties"" tied to the ship types in each wing/squad. i like this idea because it is simple, although it does not deal with the problem as nearly as efficient as more complicated ideas would do.another idea, from trebor daehdoow again, changes game mechanics to deal with lag in such a way, namely by only showing the n closest ships to your ship on grid, that fights might become more interesting, since every little region of the fight needs to have decisionmaking. one fc cant see everything anymore. the importance of range and speed(eg changing your position to see the ships you want to see) would skyrocket with this approach though. it is a brilliant idea, but the impact on combat would probably be too big for ccp to give it a try.another creative idea is the idea of noise described in to blob or not to blob. this means delaying/limiting the number of ships that can lock a single ship, so it is difficult/not possible for 100 ships to focus fire on one. if the obvious exploits can be circumvented, this is one of the best things that could happen to fleet warfare in my eyes. in theory, it would mean squads would need individual targets, which means they would need individual decisionmaking, hence the need for more fcs(or heavily multitasking fcs) as the number in your gang rises. ccp should be able to at least get something out of these ideas, and implement it to make pvp more challenging."
5/21/2010,"the brilliance of wormhole spacemy second campaign headline would have been asking ccp to add truly uncharted space. the important features for this new space would have been:- a place where it is impossible to hotdrop people or bridge fleets in. in short, a place where capitals online did not start yet. every man and every dog in eve seems to own a capital at present. even yours truly, don quixote here, who is a total noob, has a thanatos carrier. the number of supercaps ingame is ridiculous too. i know some smaller alliances quite well, and two of them even have a titan. i even dont want to know how many the large alliances have. i wanted space in which capitals are at least rare. - a place without local. its just a lot more exciting to fly around, knowing a (even probably unfair) fight might be lurking around the corner.- distant from normal space. have the feeling i am actually flying away from home.- a place where large powerblocks are less important. a place where, if you bring 10 people, chances are low you will be outnumbered 3 to 1.the longer i thought about it, the more i realized that my uncharted space was already in the game. wormhole space. i just never realized it. ofcourse, it is not so uncharted anymore. but the things that were realistic to wish for, are in it. maybe going to/coming from normal space is too easy and there should be much deeper wormhole spaces that never link to normal space or something, but still, i think ccp did an amazing job on this one. i thought it was just a nice feature, but it is more than that. it is designed for particular wishes among the players and corporations. really, a job well done."
5/21/2010,"you know the voting closed two days ago, right? i mean, it's a good writeup, and while i disagree with some of your preferences, i think you did a good job. but all the votes are in, so it really doesn't matter much any more. also, trebor's idea to have a moddable ui is hardly one exclusive to him. i ran on that platform for csm2 and csm3, and i wasn't the only one to support it. mazzilliu got csm3 to pass it, and ccp rejected it. so as much as i'd love it, it's dead. trebor is just the only one not to have noticed."
5/21/2010,moddable ui was also passed by csm1 or 2 and rejected by ccp. it's not going to happen.
5/21/2010,"i was going to post about demanding money in order to vote for you... but then realized at least one of you, if not both willa) get electedb) ignore meso lets make a compromise, i wont ask for money... instead all i want is free machrialdeal?o/\o"
5/21/2010,"so you're a troll, drama queen, bigot and just plain rude. way to show what a great potential candidate you are for csm6 or any other future election. instead of doing what you just did, all you had to do was send some e-mails over ccp about the issue and it would have been solved quickly. using the way you acted as an example, would you vote for an official candidate in a political election after (s)he acted like that? i highly doubt it.furthermore, yes, mistakes do happen, however i'm with the ccp poster and this wasn't likely to have happened. it sounds like just a poorly constructed fabrication to get some forum attention. yay for you!"
5/21/2010,thread locked as ccp diagoras has already answered the question.
5/22/2010,"new csm soon, new support by the csm? way i see it, if every csm brings it to ccp for the next 10 years, we might have a shot at this. support the dead horse pos thread. to long have the pos managers of new-eden been ignored. its amazing that pos's are the base of tech 2 and tech 3 equipment and yet ccp has left them to rot. just because something works, doesn't mean it couldn't work better. at least some changes in the right direction would go a long way to making pos managers a lot happier people, much less grumpy, and annoyed. if your a pos manager and are not grumpy and annoyed your doing it wrong.. :p"
5/22/2010,"supported. hell, i supported this five years ago. fix the bloody things. ccp!you've had dozens of viable suggestions of how to fix the pos system! hell, one of the csms submitted a viable draft proposal of how to fix the pos system years ago! why do we constantly have bread and circuses? before we do things like ambulation, let's do 'fix existing problems'! now that pos are no longer responsible for sovreignty, there's no reason not to overhaul them!"
5/22/2010,do give them covert ops cloak.
5/22/2010,"overload the rep like any sane pilot would do and it starts to look a lot better.or you're engaged in more than one fight. or the fight is not contiguous. or....actually for the most part you just die anyway. the margin on fights you can escape because of plates vs reps is pretty thin when you're flying in very small gangs/solo tank matters just as much as gank.again, see how it keeps coming down to the speed aspect?making them fast and agile will not remove the advantage of skirmish from minmatar. the advantage of skirmish is to be able to run away and you cannot do that when your effective range is within full tackle(scram/web) range and you have little extra support mechanisms(spare high slots for neuts, etc)"
5/22/2010,"so boost speed and give blaster boats moar utility? i still think they shouldn't be as agile as minnie ships, just faster straight line speed. blaster damage also needs to be increased, within that zone of death vs a blaster boat should be a zone of death."
5/22/2010,"yeah, keep parroting that, because that will really end up in a massively useful ship. except:-in tq, the best way to lose a solo bc is to get blobbed and die; and bar a skirmish fit, the second best way to deal with this is by having enough dps to kill it as fast as possible.-people you fight may actually fit a local tank, and if you cannot break it, you're stuck there doing a ""who has more cap boosters"" match.-unlike ehp and dps which are useful always, local tank is useful only while you are primary which really matters, even in small gang situations.except the part where it does since you can no longer get away, and while the lol idea of stuff like brutixes becoming the new zoom to it and tackle ship doesn't seem to nerf skirmish of another race to you, it sure does seem that way for me. particularly since you want to do it by tweaking base values based on armor fit and then assuming people are ******ed enough not to fit it with two speed mods+shieldfit+possibly snakes if they're not poor and be able to catch even a damn vagabond every time.fyi, a shield buffer brutix with 6 lows and a bit more fitting so it doesnt need rcu would already be going 1920m/s heated with od/nano. that's more then enough to tackle the ships in the same shipclass really quickly (and most non-minmatar hacs for that matter).the reasonable change is changing the penalty on armor rep and possibly resist rigs from speed to something irrelevant. boost base values by a significant amount and yes, of course you break other stuff. sure such a brutix would be marginally useful as some sort of semi-capable solo bc and it'd be massively useful for the ""look, i brought a turbofast bc sized tackler lolol"" crowd.and of course it can skirmish, it's called railguns (people don't do this because brutix can't exactly fit railguns well, much in the same way it requires fitting mods for a rack of neutrons and anything really). it's not such a novel concept, people are doing it with medium artillery already. with non-******ed fitting and a extra low it'd be actually fairly solid for this.oh, and btw, there is one thing the brutix and similar ships do need to borrow from minmatar ships, and it's versatility. currently, you're in a brutix, a frigate lands on top, either you have ecm drones or you die a painful death. this makes people not want to fly the ship solo so much, because drake/hurricane/harbinger/myrmidon do not have that problem. it's really simple to fix it, too, just give the ship 25m3 more dronebay and a utility high (it lacks slots compared to, eg, cyclone already so there is no need to take something away somewhere else)."
5/22/2010,"i to would prefer pre qr stats, even if i flown nearly the hole nano age a plated/trimarked face **** solo bs. it is quite funny that i do use mostly nano setups with ranged dps for exactly the same job this days.*shrugs*dps as a number is as meaningless as blaster pvp this days, there is a reason all ""pro"" blaster pvp is shown with maximum tank and minimum dps this days.fixing webs for blaster ships is not complicated or leads to game breaking ships, it simply fixes the meta game and gives blaster ships back his niche. i'm not saying it is the only thing that is wrong with it, but it is the thing that gives you back at least a point in the meta game by not being as handy caped as other ship classes at point blank. without slaves, a active tank will remain nearly the same time on the field as a buffer fit(for non comedy active tanks). in many situations unfortunately this will be true in both ways, meaning that it made no real difference going with buffer or active.the problem is that it comes at a huge pricetag of weapon range, flexibility with the fittings, speed(trimarks), slots, dps and being more affected by neuts.with implants and combat boosters it can be effective, but as stand alone on most ships in plain t2 it puts to many drawbacks up in front for something that ""might"" make a difference in the end.this."
5/22/2010,"no. it would not. turret hit quality is entirely determined by the hit chance and the only thing that signature resolution does is provide the baseline for a linear modification of the targets speed to be plugged into the tracking formula based on target signature radius. furthermore, the tracking formula weights percentage changes in signature resolution the same as percentage changes in tracking. if you reduce the signature resolution by 10% its the exact same as increasing the tracking by 10%e.g.tracking part of the to hit formula.5^{[(turret res * speed) / (range * tracking * ship sig)]^2}modify turret res by -10%.5^{[(.9 * turret res * speed) / (range * tracking * ship sig)]^2}some basic algebra {multiply by 9/10 = divide by 10/9) turns that into .5^{[(turret res * speed) / (range * 1.111 * tracking * ship sig)]^2}edit: also whoever did that hit quality formula on the eve-wiki has it wrong.eve crops at .5 and 1.49 not at .51 and 1.5. actual formula is(hit chance +.99)/2 = avg non wrecking hit quality(hit chance - .01)[(hit chance +.99)/2]+0.03 = final expected dps for all hit chances > .01"
5/22/2010,"ideas for buffing rails;1. decrease rail rof by 50% and increase damage to compensate, adjust other stats to keep the same.. gives an 8 ish second rof with 3 dmg mods. projectiles still have 2x volley advantage. fixes ammo consumption.dps lasers > hybrids > projectilesvolley lasers < hybrids < projectiles2. create 2 lines of ammo, with the same damage at each optimal, one 4:1 therm to kin + tracking one 4:1 kin to therm - cap use.3. + 10% damage mod.4. drop hybrid reload to 5 secs - important for m hybrids, hybrid ammo doesn't have the falloff flexibility of projectiles.^^ picking a couple of them would work."
5/22/2010,"i think this would be pretty easily to implement, and at the same time make it alot easier to fly. so... +1"
5/22/2010,"the idea holds a lot of merit.but, in order to be balanced, it should be a much lower base system strength, so that the maximum strength can be around what we have now. it's already incredibly hard to take over systems as is."
5/22/2010,good idea.
5/22/2010,this would also further encourage active use of systems which was an objective of dominion.
5/22/2010,1
5/22/2010,hiranawhy wouldnt the person set up one account use the free 30 days then pay for an extra 30 days $15 and then use the buddy system and get 30 free days to get 90 days right there for $15. the 2nd character would use 21 day free trial then pay 15 for 30 days and then use the buddy system for an extra 30 days. 81 days for $15 dollars. then the last account would use the free 21 days and pay for say 2 month or the three month option. so he would get 81 days for $30. then you just transfer the 2 first characters into the third for $20/each or $40.00 total. so all told you would get these three accounts going for $100.00. or roughly 3 gtcs - lets say 1.6 billion isk. if they each make 63 mill/month or 200 mill total/month you are paid back 8 months. this is far superior than buying 3 gtcs because after 8 months you not only get your 1.6 billion but you keep getting an additional 1.6 billion every 8 months in exchange for $15. 15 dollars for 1.6 billion isk! thats some pretty cheap isk.
5/22/2010,i support this product and/or service.
5/22/2010,hell yea
5/22/2010,good idea.

5/22/2010,lol grin's i guess that is one way to keep there complain lv's down if they handle there own tickets lol
5/22/2010,"this concerns an entire mechanic rather then a specific petition. specific cases should be petitioned, but when requesting that ccp change their way of handling certain petition classes, going trough the csm should be perfectly fine."
5/22/2010,"since there's currently no way to ask ""let me speak to your supervisor"" a gm could completely suppress petitions against themselves. that's not right, and needs to be fixed."
5/22/2010,"i must be entirely mistaken on the purpose of the csm, then. the petition system does need an overhaul; the circumstance of a gm complaint petition getting put into the lap of the same gm you're complaining about is ridiculous, and really puts the fact in the spotlight.in fact, that type of petition should start much higher up in the chain. appropriately with much more serious consequences for misuse."
5/22/2010,"it would be nice to see a response from ccp on this. it is clearly a conflict of interest if not a misuse/abuse. the csm maybe the correct avenue for this, but surley ccp reads this forum?"
5/22/2010,makes sense. even if he was right it is stupid that a petition against him would go to him.
5/22/2010,"you can ask: """"let me speak to a senior gm"" and if refused or stalled for an extended period you can contact directly internal affairs at ccp. a filter ""give me a gm different from [insert name]"" would rapidly degenerate as people would share the name of gm they feel are unsympathetic so that everyone will avoid them and try to get the bleeding hears gm that will easily reimburse ships, lift bans and generally rule in favor of the players requests.even worse it will allow people to try to get gm sympathetic to one alliance or a stile of gaming."
5/22/2010,the question everyone isn't asking but should have thought of at least once is -just what did you do and what was the action?this smells of whinery.
5/22/2010,"still, he has a point: i know from experience how frustrating it is when all complaints about a person must go through that person. if it's whinery, the higher up would just brush it off for being just that. if it's not..."
5/22/2010,"i recently ran into a petition disappearing from my interfaces and created a petition under: ""rules & policies""/""gm & isd"". it was picked up by a senior directly, so as far i am concerned the requested means is already available .. turns out the petition i petitioned hadn't been deleted but that ccp tools are fubar and failed at associating the email/account properly if the senior is the issue then the matter should go to ia which is by mail only i think.the only thing i would like to be more accessible is how/when to contact ia .. especially the how"
5/22/2010,"completely false. ask for your petition to be escalated to a senior gm. they're obligated to pass it along right away. if that doesn't work(and i've never heard of it not working when the petitioner made clear what they wanted), contact internal affairs. this stuff isn't as well-publicized as it perhaps should be, but it does exist."

5/22/2010,"/supported/mega-supportedin fact, several csm candidates ran on platforms stating essentially the same thing. ccp needs to slow down on the new content and spend more time on stability and qa issues. in my own campaign, i proposed an 18 month to 2 year expansion cycle, instead of the 6-month to 1 year cycle currently in use."
5/22/2010,"actually, i agree with everything you posted, but i still don't support the idea.what i would like to see is more balanced expansions, with new content and fixes to current ones.the entire eve community is at best.... whiny. if there is only new content and no fixes to your personal favorite mechanic you will whine on the forums, ""wuaaah fix roflkets, wuaaah fix fw"". if there is no new content other people will whine on the forums ""wuaaah, no new content, wtf ccp! i cancel my 10 subscriptions today... wuaaah etc etc"".the only chance to please everyone will be to simply do both at a smaller scale rather than focusing on just one aspect and be patient. ccp are (hopefully) aware of the issues, but as any company they have limited resources.now, if only they fix those damn railguns..."
5/22/2010,"don't forget the other three epic pirate arcs, t3 frigates, the other t3 subsystems and ai upgrades. there's a whole content worth in just finishing stuff that already exists."
5/22/2010,"i would say that before we go hanging ccp for 'not getting it', we should ask them - ccp, what percentage of your resources are allocated to:*fixing the little stuff (tweaks and balances, annoying but non-critical bugs, minor features that the community asks for)*doing the promised 'we will return to x' (and which things are planned to getting done with this team just now)*refactoring (fixing the lag)*entirely new features (such as pi and incarna)*just out of curiosity: dust.now, i'm not suggesting we get a lot of time spent on this - i think the eve community just needs some ballpark figures so that it can see if it wants to push ccp to put more resources to existing content."
5/22/2010,"0%0% not much , but still its more than 0%.i wouldnt say to much considering how poor upcoming expansion is gooing to be.my guess is 20%a lot ?"
5/22/2010,"ccp *can't* not introduce something new. they have to introduce something new for the sake of marketing at least. they did 1 expansion where they didn't introduce anything new and only improved what was already there and it was the least successful expansion to date. so modifying the proposal i'd say to make your expansion a revamp of corp/alliance window, implementing the treaties system so there's something to use as a marketing tool, and don't add anything else new. more importantly than doing 'fixes' is to do a whole expansion without screwing over the player base. that's what i'm lacking confidence in."
5/22/2010,thumbs up
5/22/2010,"this proposal gets my absolute unequivocal support. gabriel is a smart man who had some impressively creative ideas concerning the current disgusting state of gallentean ships and weaponry. he broadened his view and realized that what is wrong with gallente is not a single problem, but rather a large group of deeply rooted flaws. his work to fix them is some of the most polished forum posting i've ever seen. kudos.on the topic of the afterburner bonus everyone seems to be allergic to, we all need to keep in mind that even a ship with maxed out skills will still not move faster than a ship fitted with a microwarpdrive. it is simply to give gallente a speed boost while not blowing up their sig radius to the size where they get killed on the way in.the hyperion needs a buff. the hyperion needs a buff badly. the proposed 10% to armor per level is an excellent way to give it survivability in a pvp situation without messing with its slot layout or grid (its currently at 6 lowslots and low grid.i'm a tiny bit doubtful on the optimal range bonus on the roden boats. i feel that gallente should try to steer clear of doing the sniper thing. gallente have always historically been masters of close range. so i propose that instead of an optimal range bonus, gallentean sniper boats might want to try a damage boost to rails. make railguns a viable weapons system.my two cents, if it helps"
5/22/2010,"idea of gallente needing a buff is fully suported. however the devs should at least try to give their vision and suggestion on race balance. yeah sure they might be ""gallente are fine"", they are also ""speedtanks and mwds are fine"", and when cry/whine amount on forums broke thresholds they used 5 ton hammer to ""balance"" it.drones still have ai issues and dumb moments when they bug up.diemost and astarte? eos was nerfed too hard yeas ago and no attempts to fix it. damps being a bit meh on bonused ships.blasters/grid/active armor tank comedy that leads to most recomented tanks for myrm/ishtar and even hype being shield."
5/22/2010,"so, i read the proposal linked in the op.the proposal linked in the op states that the taranis is so underpowered that it needs a significant tracking boost (wut?), an extra drone, a massive increase in overheated turret dps, oh, and a falloff bonus as well so that it can apply this dps all the way across scram range. merely out-dpsing the other combat inties by 40%+ as it currently does is just *not enough*. from this i conclude that the author of the proposal linked in the op is either a lunatic or is simply crying for a set of ridiculous solopwnmobiles.more seriously, while there are some gallente ships with issues, the blanket bonuses proposed will make those that are already very strong (on the frigate level, this covers the taranis, ishkur, tristan, and incursus) ludicrously op. moreover, some of the proposed changes affect shipclasses that are underpowered more or less across the board (eafs, command ships, tier 1 battlecruisers, non-thrasher/sabre destroyers and interdictors); only fixing the gallente hulls while leaving ships like the hyena in their current state would be silly."

5/22/2010,"eos needs to tank not gank, bonuses should support that. command links add additional defensive effects, so any drone type links are out. gallente having ew links is nonsense, gallente should have the armour links, and amarr should be given new links that affect cap usage."
5/22/2010,"drone links are a terrible idea. links are for support, not dps. try this on for size(and note that a max-skill eos with a mindlink multiplies the face bonus of a gang link by a factor of 13):sensor integrity link: currently 3% sensor strength. change to either 6% sensor strength or 3% to each of sensor strength, targeting range, and scan resolution. recon operation link: currently 2% ew optimal range. change to 3% to ew optimal and falloff range. electronic superiority link: currently 2% to painters and ecm, 1.2% to td and sd. change to 3% to painters, 2% to ecm, td, and sd. eos: i don't actually have a clue what to do with this thing. but make it stop sucking, please. hopefully that makes info warf links suck less badly."
5/22/2010,"yeah i guess i should have made it about information links tbh, but i am glad i didnt get bombarded with 'just use the other race links, you arent forced to use information links' replies xdwhat about we have the following.initial skill - increases drone hitpointslink 1 - increases drone control rangelink 2 - increases drone speedlink 3 - increases drone tracking / op / falloffin theory this isnt a dps buff its more of a drone buff although i find it weak without a dps increase tbhsaying that information links are wrong in everyway"
5/22/2010,more drones is good news in my book. i vote yay!
5/22/2010,"i have been experimenting with t3 ships, first the tengu - which i consider pretty well made. then the lokifor some inexplicable reason, loki has very small cargo space. if you want to build roaming pvp setup similar to vagabond, you get 280 m3 cargo. in comparison, the vagabond gets 360 m3 cargo - which feels much more reasonable. the ac loki setup gives bonus to projectile rof, so the rate of ammo consumption is very high, which means the small cargo hold particularly annoying.basically, i'd want to see loki cargo hold increased to at least 350 m3, similar to vagabond. as far as game balance goes, the little extra space is not going to impact power balance in any noticeable way. however, the reduced cargo space serves as never ending annoyance to the player. why needlessly annoy the player? let people enjoy slightly more cargo capacity."

5/22/2010,"with a quick search i found this, so posting the idea here for csm consideration. apologies if i've missed it somewhere else.new skills with prerequisites should be able to be queued so long as the required prerequisites remain ahead in the queue.the whole reason for the queue is to avoid the requirement to set an alarm clock to update skills. while you can put something in the queue after the prereqs, it could be several hours before you can start the skill that you actually want training.this would mean that if a skill is removed, a check would need to be made to see if there are any skills which require that as a prereq. this already done for skill levels - you can't take a skill at lvl 2 out of the queue if lvl 3 is in the queue after it."
5/22/2010,"if i may impose fantisy to your staunch reality a moment, what if you chould transport perhaps 4 battleships worth of rigged ships to a large fleet combat zone, prefitted and rigged for players, in your fleet so in the event they loose their current ship, then they warp to the het (heavy equpment transport) support ship and grab their backup. now you have a combat ready pilot in seconds rather than him having to go and totally refit a new ship, which can be vary time consuming. this can turn a battle in your favor quickly. that is the heart of the idea for having something bigger than an orca to hual ships. and to top that idea off, why not limit this het support ship to just hualing ships that are fitted and rigged, and yes perhaps that kind of power is better suited to being locked in lowsec, but its one hell of a good idea to think about now isnt it?"
5/22/2010,"looking past the wall of text which i can only assume is an attempt to communicate (i think i've managed to decipher it into something like english...), how is what you're proposing going to be more 'fun' than what is currently in the game?all i can see in you post is a few more potential tools that you can use to work towards the same goals that already exist.marines to take over ships, different ship carrier, even jetpacks on planets - if you find all the multitude of activities that eve currently offers 'boaring', i don't see these new activities changing that."
5/22/2010,"we already have ""het"" ships... they're called industrial command ships, carriers, supercarriers, and titans."
5/22/2010,"supported. this change is the most epic fail of tyrannis yet, and tyrannis is a complete fail to begin with. but that change, tops the cake.bring back the ctrl,shift,alt keys to shortcuts"
5/22/2010,"achmed, i think you're misinterpreting. it sounds to me like they're making it so that you can't have just a naked ctrl key as a shortcut. you can still use ctrl-r as your reload shortcut, though. this is one where it's so weird and niche that i have to assume there's some kind of technical reason."
5/22/2010,this. i'm looking at the shortcut keys now and all the old bindings are still there. it's rather odd they allowed plain old ctrl to be a shortcut to begin with (other than to lock something when clicking on the overview).
5/22/2010,"based on proxy warfare, this ship will be designed to purely increase damage on a hostile ship and debuff it in such a way or 'protect' a small area from a specific effect / damage based on its raceit will be a t2 version of a bc, the ones that do not have a t2 versionit will be able to equip a module (only 1) that increases racial damage upon that ship, for example the t2 amarrian version will increase all em damage only by 100%, in addition to this it will also increase the effect of ew based on race againamarr - neuts will be 10% more effective on the target draining 10% more, tracking distruptors will also be 10% effectivecaldari - ecm, ecm modules will be 10% effective on the targetgallente - warp jammers, will now have a 100% increase to jamming str and sensor dampeners will be 20% more effectiveminmatar - target painters will be 20% more effective and stasis webs will have a 10% increased effectthese cruisers wont be able to stack and due to speciality activating the module will cause the ship to stop moving and wont be able to warp until the cycle is over or until the ship has exploded, effective ecm on the proxy cruiser will stop the effect careless of if the cycle is complete or notthe module can only be used in high slot, it will also have a different function via a script, rather than increasing the damage of one ship it will reduce em (assuming its amarr) damage by 5% on all ships within a 10km radius, penalties will still apply, this doesnt stack and you can either have direct damage increase or damage reduction.this will be good when primarying people and also serve as a nice defensive ship, the bonus (direct damage / damage reduction) wont be stackable.oh and each cycle consists of 30 secs"
5/22/2010,"sounds cool to me. think it should be called wi. ladies'knight though, as tigerclaw isnt vey innapropriate."

5/22/2010,"you're talking as if democracy in its modern form is something good it's pretty fine you can affect the game in the same proportion you're already supporting it via your subs. also considering that less than 20% actually voted, we can safely state that these elections resemble true democracy of the past in a significantly better way, than stupid one man = one vote mass elections. only the most worthy (and those who actually care) are taking part, that's a good thing.don't be a fool."
5/22/2010,"i can honestly say that i voted with only one account, (i have two), however i had no real idea about the candidates and went purely of what they wrote in that little 'blurb' thingy next to each of the characters pictures in the voting page.hint- people that wrote nothing or very little didnt exactly command any respect... o_0"
5/22/2010,"i voted for you, mostly because there was a voice behind the words, but i liked your background and ideas too, took me one hour to go throught all the list...you were quite down near the end if i remember. i hope you got it i would feel like i bet on the right horse"
5/22/2010,mynxee won my vote by the sound of her voice alone... and her thoughts on ui issues - but mostly her voice. must be some sansha mind trick going on because now i'm her willing slave...go mynx-ee! go mynx-ee! :: geeky cheerleader-esq bop ::
5/22/2010,"the voter numbers are very interesting. i have been playing since before the inception of the csm, but this is the first csm election i have voted in. this was primarily because in the past i have felt like csm discussions focused very heavily on affairs in 0.0 space and factional warfare - and while i feel that those are important parts of the game, they're not parts of the game that i'm active in right now.i was nearly one of the abstaining masses this time too, but the increased campaigning, along with the article in massively, actually got me to look at some of the issues the candidates were bringing up. based on that i decided that i should vote. i will say that it was a difficult choice, and that i only voted with one of my three accounts, because i didn't feel quite right getting 3x the votes that someone else might get. i'm still just one player. that's just a personal thing though.anyway, looking forward to seeing the winners next week, and to seeing what the new csm can accomplish this time."
5/22/2010,"i'd be kind of curious to see where the votes came from such as how many accounts in britain, us, russia, germany, etc. voted. also did they vote mostly for folks from their own nations, or was it spread around pretty well. i just dig demographic data like that. i would also be curious what the fictional demographics were in that how many came from caldari, minmatar, amarr, and gallente. it would be kind of funny if the gallente had the worst turnout, considering they are the only ""democratic"" empire. it would also be fun to see what fictional races got the most same race support.technically shouldn't tibus heth win in a landslide of caldari voters everytime. tibus heth on the csm might be pretty interesting."
5/22/2010,"confirming that all the ""mega alliances"" members did/do have nothing else worry about. i mean, hey, we all know the csm seats are most vital to 0.0 gameplay and outcome of nullsec wars and stuff, right? who cares about being able to get a decent fight when you can vote instead?"
5/22/2010,its called taking any advantage you can get a hold of. please do not try to act as you people have the high ground. anyone who keeps any kind of tabs on what's going on knows the score and knows how bad it is right now. the influence you could exercise on the game through the csm to trip the odds in your favor makes it far more likely in these times that alliance leadership would move to have its members vote for their candidate. i wont believe otherwise till i see names. but this spike in the votes and the heavy zero sec outlook in the past and its effects leads me to believe that's exactly what happened.anyone in the war knows the score. i don't need to re-hash that out here. while i hate it. to be honest you guys would be foolish not to i suppose. but i cant end without saying this when it comes to fights. don't talk about a decent fight when molle himself orders one of the craziest logoffskis ever.
5/22/2010,"okay, for the sake of the argument then... you adressed ""mega alliances"". assuming you picked your phrase carefully there, that makes all alliances with ""mega"" member numbers, aka in excess of 1k members viable. with regards to your point of ""block voting""/""taking over csm"" or however you do want to call it.by current in-game listing there are over 30 of those. compared to the number of available csm seats and the posted votes required to get a csm seat / alternate spot that would logically imply, that if your assumption were right, all, or maybe all but one seat on the csm would go to those alliances. history of recent csm panels does not really support this, but well, maybe this time it all changed? so if you were correct, we'd see on the next csm panel (almost) exclusively members of those ""mega alliances"", if your assumption were right that those were trying to ""take over"" the csm. more so, as we cannot be sure that someone external might ""accidentally"" vote for one of the candidates from those alliances (gods beware!), as they might raise some valid point in their campaign. going by sheer numbers under the assumption you are right (and myself wrong about lots of 0.0 not caring a whit about csm), we'll see come next week a (almost) full 0.0 alliance-stocked csm, right?would be utterly surprised if that would happen, i'd actually still be surprised if only half the future csm members came (by order of alliance size ofc) from those entities. but maybe i'll be proven all wrong and the conspiracy theory is true..."
5/22/2010,just post the results!it's electronic. i would think the results themselves are pretty absolute no?
5/22/2010,"i have cast my votes to the same person this year with my 3 accounts, (still waiting for that 30.00 isk aswell) but i would consider splitting my votes if each candidate would better for example my industrial char and the other would benefit my pvp char, any ignore all that when is season 3 starting dillon??? ;) enjoy the rest"
5/22/2010,"multiple accounts getting multiple votes - actually i see this as being fairer. if you're willing to pay for 2 or 3 (or more) accounts, then surely you should have 2 or 3 (or more) times the say over the future of the game."
5/22/2010,"yeah. i did. but your missing the focus slightly. i meant nc and sc in this regard. (and yeah i am with an nc corp) and i'll state it again, without names i can only speculate. but voting was substantially higher than in the previous four elections and there is a huge war raging. if you look at the general situation and see the signs you see what appears to be powerblock voting. without the winners what i've stated is speculation. speculation based on the evidence but still speculation. i'm not backing off my position that it appears the big groups voted in blocks. 1k votes per candidate that got in. that's a shocking number. and yes, i think it has changed. i think that both sides wish to influence the war and that this would be one heck of a way to do it. honestly? i hope your right that it isn't packed with zero sec alliances. and i still hold out hope my vote was one of the ones that put t'amber in. but that isn't looking good. names will tell the tale and if this spike in voting was eve being more politically aware then i will be one happy guy even if t'amber doesn't make it in. but given the following: the massive voter spike, the conflict up north, h-w, and the zero sec heavy agenda of these candidates. i'm forced to believe that something less than perfect was at work here."
5/22/2010,"based on that should a person who pays more tax have more say in how a country is run? yeah i know eve isn't like the real world, just a comparison.by some quirk of fate for the next month i have 5 accounts. do i really deserve 5 times the say in the games development?oh and thanks for the graph diagoras, more please!"
5/22/2010,"you guys know more about this then i do, but whats the breakdown of who voted by percentage of accounts that actually had a logon during the voting month? like i have 3 accounts that autobill to my cc so they would remain active but i might have not been around for the month due to x and didn't even know. that would give you a better breakdown of who actually cared to vote or not instead of who voted / (didnt vote + mega afk)"
5/22/2010,"you would be surprised. look up ""timocracy"" in a good encyclopedia, or prolly even wikipedia. the greeks of antiquitiy didn't think too badly about that. as opposed to some comments about democracy occasionally made. just as a footnote, personally i don't think csm elections rank as truly ""democratic"" if the majority of players abstains. thus prolly some bastard-child of political theory anway..."
5/22/2010,... and in every precinct.
5/22/2010,"i think people are over analyzing this election a bit. the increase in votes is easily explained by the growing amount of players combined with the easy access to vote in the startup screen. i think more ""silent majority"" high sec newcomers (like me) have used their vote. that said, some results will surprise the oldskool establishment in eve most likely. people who were given a high spot in the voting list and took their time to put in decent campaign letter will be rewarded. new people don`t know any of the names on that list and wont vote for ""big headed alliance bobble heads who don't even take time to put in campaign letter"" as they don`t show commitment, solid program or willingness to defend rights of the small players...as for big nullsec alliances taking over.. most are competing i would think , so they will only undermine each other in the council and work counterproductive. it made me laugh when some people said it would influence the outcome of major conflicts... it wont , the council has the power of suggestion only , their mandate doesn't include decision making , and that`s probably the reason why major alliances have never taken a firmer grip over the election.i think the council overall is a good idea and will help greatly with improving the game by suggestion game adjustments to the devs. fresh ideas keep game young. the trip to iceland is a well deserved reward for those who help the game advance selflessly every day and that`s what it's all about in the end :).just my 2 cents"

5/23/2010,i have a widow and it needs some lov. because its only got 4 low slots you cant put on 7 cargo expanders like the other bo's... so you cant hold enouth fuel to be usefull. please please reduce the consumption amount for bridging! the jump range is also pathetic.. atleast 6-8ly please! and please give it t2 resists.. its worth nearly a billion isk for god sake. cov-ops cloak would be usefull...its the olny ship in the stealth gang that cant fit one and its the most expensive. the no targting delay after de-cloak is pointless... you dont tackle in a 700-bil isk ship with 30-50k ehp.. so whats the point.-reduce consumption for bridging by atleast half... so you can bridge a gang back again without 7 expanders. if you cant carry 30k iso... you need to use less. 6666 is useless atm. -increase jump range and bridge range to atleast 6-8ly with skills.. it will then be worth bridging! be able to bridge to any cyno/beacon. bridging 3 jumps is just stupid.. its not worth the cost of the fuel you dont have enouth of. -t2 resists so its less fragile!-covert ops cloak would be realy helpfull for its role but not essential. its so slow and has such a big sig radious i cant see why not?

5/23/2010,"i can understand the issue and support it to an extent. when it came to skill ghosting, that is technically ""your"" character doing the training. when it comes to rp generation it's the agent that's doing it, not your character.let me ask a question: if you're a ceo of a company and you went on vacation for a few weeks/month (accnt inactive for a month or so) does your company cease to function during that time? no. your company and contacts continue to function as they were so why would someone you hired in-game to research stop doing what you paid him to do? (or persuaded)? when it comes to skill generation you're on vacation, you aren't training so it makes sense.again i understand the problem and perhaps if datacores weren't so expensive we wouldn't be having this problem. believe me, my agent is only a lvl 2 and i generate a measly 11/hr but can't you also consider this a helpful 'nudge' to come back and play so you don't have to grrrrind missions or mine? just a thought."

5/23/2010,what you've been put through on this has been a complete farce. at no time in any setting should the individual who a complaint has been lodged against be responding to that complaint. that's what multiple supervisors/gm's/etc are for. it is simply unethical for this gm to be responding to a complaint about himself.
5/23/2010,how can anyone in their right mind in any setting think that it is acceptable for that to happen? it's just wrong to complain to someone that they're doing something wrong and expect them to fix it. clearly this is a case of unethical action taken by a gm.
5/23/2010,this is not a acceptible display of gm management
5/23/2010,well my faith in the gm's wasnt particularly high its not gonna get higher with loopholes such as this one.
5/23/2010,"please could you take these two changes into consideration:1. when entering a buy or sell order, as with contracts, the wording of the incremental amount should be displayed before hitting ok. this could save traders a lot of isk.example: i put in a buy order for 25500000, as i enter the digits, the window will display ""25.5 million""2. please move the cancel order button to below location, far from the modify order option. it is easy to misclick losing a lot of isk to resetting up of orders.example:current:cancel ordermodify ordershow infoview market detailslocationproposed:view market detailsmodify orderlocationshow info----------cancel orderreasons: when you're going through your orders, you almost always first view the details, then modify the order, so this reduces total mouse move distance (since you don't always change an order) and is an operations order hint.adding a menu separator would be a good thing too (lots of eve menus would benefit). it increases the distance to the ""dangerous"" menu items and is a visual separator between safe and dangerous option.bonus: barrier (confirmation box) for the ""cancel order"" option - it's something that is rarely used so that having to click ""yes"" each time you actually do want to cancel an order (with the option to remember that setting like jumping into low/null) won't be a big hassle.please feel free to comment, but i will not respond to flamebait.ana[edited to reflect comments posted yet again ]"

5/23/2010,"you obviously didn't read closely enough.and like dzajic mentioned... it would be nice if a dev or someone from ccp would at least either acknowledge or dismiss the idea that there is a problem with gallente ships (the gunboats in particular). if a problem is acknowledged, people will throw in more thoughts and ideas on how to fix them rather than simply saying ""no changes are needed, stop whining.""and if the problem is dismissed and stated that it is ""working as intended"" i'll shut my mouth and start training for something else."
5/23/2010,"no u.the op wants to remove the taranis' tracking bonus (37.5% at all-v) and simply increase the tracking of all blasters by 50%. that, for the slower among us, would be ""a significant tracking boost."" the op wants to increase all blasters' overload damage boost from 15% to 30-50%. that, for the slower among us, would be ""a massive increase in overheated turret dps."" the op wants every gallente ship to have a bigger drone bay; that, for the slower among us, would give the taranis ""an extra drone."" the op, having given blasters a bigger tracking buff than the ranis' old bonus ever gave, then wants the ranis to have a falloff bonus, thus giving it ""a falloff bonus as well so that it can apply this dps all the way across scram range.""tell me, do you routinely support things you haven't bothered to read?"
5/23/2010,ever since the web nerf gallente has had severe trouble with tracking. rails suffering especially.not to mention pwg is borked and hyperion slot layout makes no sense compared to mega (switch mega and hyperion mid/low slots).edit: additionally. replace dual rails with dual blasters. dual rails are epic failage.
5/23/2010,"there needs to be more perks to the owners of a system if they have sovereignty to make covering the cost worth it. i propose the following perks:- if you have sovereignty when you jump/log into a system you have sovereignty there should be a delayed effect before you appear in local. say like 20-30 seconds.- if your alliance has sovereignty then your cyno does not appear on the overview for people to just rage warp to it and kill whatever is jumping in.- you should have an increased on board scanner range if your in a system you have sovereignty in.- if you are not blue with the alliance that holds the sovereignty then you de-cloak within 10 seconds after jumping into their systemthese are just a few of the perks and i will update the op when more comes to mind. bottom line is there needs to be more benefits for paying for these systems. especially the crappy systems that are not that good for belts, plexes and such."

5/23/2010,"the perks are just fine. the problem isn't sov costing too much or the upgrades from the ihub; it's the fact that you obviously don't have pilots flying there doing anything so there's no need to have that space to begin with. if you guys use only 5 systems and can't manage to support another 5-10, why do you have them in the first place? other alliances just drop them now since they're pointless and then get all protective when an up-coming smaller alliance decides to pick them up since they want to use them. if you're not going to use them, stop trying to hoard space and then complaining about the costs."

5/23/2010,supported :)
5/23/2010,more like this one
5/23/2010,"personally i prefer her idea, shame its older than 90 days, i dont see what the big worry is about giving drones extra dpsgallente would benefit the most, ofc with blasters and rails being crap atm having a drone buff doesnt exactly change things.oh and the other links can be used offensively, ever had a damanation in a fleet with a guardian, op much, same with vulture.claymore well that should be classed as defensive, have that in any medium sized roaming fleet and you get sick skills, increasing range of jammers / webs, not offensive?i personally think increasing drone damage is fine, alot of ships wouldnt benefit and the ones that do are pretty much gallente anyway."
5/23/2010,"i think the info warfare links should be a bit more useful for everyone in fleet, as all the others are. i was thinking about what's missing and maybe ccp should replace the sensor strength bonus for a scan res + targeting range bonus. boosting the whole fleet's sensor strength on the off chance that someone will get jammed/damped is pretty pointless. the other two are pretty useful as most people in small gangs have points/webs fitted.edit: i think introducing drone/weapon links is a bad idea. there are too many people that just don't bother with drones in a small, fast gang and weapon links will only help a fraction of the fleet. the links would essentially be a waste as only a percentage of the fleet would benefit from them. better to have links that will benefit the whole fleet the whole time."
5/23/2010,"you do know that link doesnt affect webs/jammers yeh :p thats minmatar, the gallente one affects ecm and stuff like that.skirmish - interdiction = increases range of webs / points which in a way is offensive considering almost everything has a jammer equiptright now what we need to look at is the usefulness compared to other commands, and if its a choice between eos and any other command eos will never get picked.speed, armor and shield are covered, while theres many options for information warfare links, drone buffing makes sense."
5/23/2010,tell me if im wrong but ccp did try somethink a few years ago as some ppl have the skills books already and they couldnt get it to work then y would it work now i dont disagree just trying to rember facts lol again tell me if im wrong

5/23/2010,"cargo capacity on combat ships is balanced around cap booster charges, not around ammo. i sort of assume that this was intentional."
5/23/2010,"perhaps, but the amount of pure frustration caused by this seems to outweigh any minor game balance effect this may have.have you tried flying ac loki?how many combat ships you flown with 280 m3 or less cargo?i bring this up because i tried it, and it sucks."
5/23/2010,"actually i do fly an ac loki, and between the ammo, the nanite repair paste, and the sisters probes in the hold, i'm using less than half of my available cargo space.the only time i could see this really being an issue is if you were going out on hours long roams without stopping to resupply."
5/23/2010,"which is usually my style. being in a noob corp, i have no blues, everybody is an enemy.but even if it's no big deal for some people. surely you wouldn't think that adding 70 m3 would make this ship overpowered? which is also my point, the difference in game balance is too small compared to better overall enjoyment of flying the ship."
5/23/2010,yes.
5/23/2010,cant see why not
5/23/2010,"my loki setup has even 200m3 now that's really pathetic, considering its sole purpose is to support my real combat ships holding some extra ammo, boosters and loot.fix this."
5/23/2010,"yeah, i can understand the nature of the complaint, and i don't really see an issue with it - i'll support it as a nice to have."
5/23/2010,fix the legion then other ships then your weight issues
5/23/2010,"if my math is correct, you should be able to fit 22,400 rounds of medium projectile ammunition in a 280 m3 cargo bay. that's not a small amount by any standards. if you find yourself unable to carry enough ammo, maybe get a fleet member or two to carry some for you. considering the other issues in game, i'd say this is way down on the list."
5/23/2010,you think that one only carries ammo and nothing more. but you also need nanite repair paste.a bit spare room for loot.220mm ac have 1.7s rof on a loki with just 2 gyros (1.6s with 3). 2s with 425mm ac. so the potentiel 22400 rounds wouldnt last very long.

5/23/2010,"already been asked for, already been refused. stupidly, in my opinion, but i don't see ccp changing their minds."
5/23/2010,"i voted a significant (10+) number of times across three candidates tbhvuk got a single vote from me after the mass nc alliance mail went out saying ""a-k vote vuk, l-z vote elven"" or whatever their names were.vast majority of my votes went to a dude from it alliance and a dude from an empire corp.the fact that lemmings will listen to people who tell them how to vote is hilarious, tbh i think in the csm if this sort of crap is uncovered on forums or in alliance mails it should automatically dq the candidate. but that's another can of worms entirely. it's totally not enforceable (and so open to exploitation it's crazy)---here's the mail that went around the nc:"
5/23/2010,over 300 thousand people abstained.
5/23/2010,"so only 12% of player base voted? thats pretty low and in my opinion only indicates how little csm has managed to impact this game so far.stability of game system is worse then ever in my playing courier of this game.new features are halfdone and abandoned pretty soon after release.so exactly why do we even need csm when it has no effect other then handfull of people gets free trip to iceland? bringing things into csm meeteings is one thing, results is another.if i would get my way, i would push bugfix release and delay new content untill new content is feature ready to release. no half baked **** like were getting now. pi lacks that little thing called nuke from orbit they showed us year ago in fanfest. how come its missing? becouse ccp dosent care and csm dosent care."
5/23/2010,"the number of subscribed accounts does not equate to an equal number of people. abstaining suggests a deliberate action. i bet a lot of people didn't vote their accounts not because they deliberately chose not to vote but due to lack of csm awareness. i based this on the fact that numerous times while campaigning, i heard (even from several folks who've been playing awhile) questions such as ""what's the csm?"", ""oh, has voting started for that?"", ""where do i find out who to vote for?"". there are plenty of people who just log in, play the game, and simply fail to tune in to anything external to the game. 12% of eligible accounts (not players)...and it's almost twice the amount as voted for csm4. a very big increase. hopefully that's a reflection that the various efforts to inform and motivate people re the csm are working.don't forget that ccp is giving the csm stakeholder status as of csm5. it remains to be seen how that will play out to players' benefit, but it will entitle the csm to more of a voice than ever before. it's up to the csm to use that voice effectively, while recognizing that the ability to influence change in eve is subject to practical constraints imposed by ccp. those constraints include resource availability, bottom line considerations, software development timelines in general, ccp's current vision for the various elements of eve, and obstacles that may arise due to ccp's corporate culture. it is vital that the csm recognize those constraints and--where possible--suggest creative ways around them.from the outside looking in, it may seem as if the csm accomplishes very little. however, don't forget--as teadaze has often commented in csm4's meeting minutes--that a lot of the discussion that takes place between the csm and ccp cannot be shared with players due to nda restrictions. so just because you don't hear about certain things being discussed or addressed, it doesn't mean they aren't on the radar."
5/23/2010,"or maybe they simply, and reasonably, have no interest in the csm. they just want to play the game for a few hours after work, relax and have fun. it's a hobby. they have no interest in ""external"" anything because that's not what they play eve for."
5/23/2010,"of course. i know quite a few players like that. i used to be one. someday, though, something in the game or their outlook may change enough to make them take an interest in the csm and its work. or who knows--maybe something the csm itself does will get their attention and motivate more interest."
5/23/2010,i only voted and campaigned for cat!it's important we have a voice of reason on the csm!
5/23/2010,300 thousand people don't know they are buying a free holiday for some fevered egos.
5/23/2010,"they don't know that they are paying for the regular passing out due to alcohol overdose of an entire multimedia company either - so what's the difference? there are many options for ccp to improve on their game, most of which are an order of magnitude more expensive than 9 airline tickets and a few hotel nights. and if you still think that the csm is a 'pr-stunt' or 'ineffective at accomplishing anything', you have but to thank your own voluntary ignorance."

5/23/2010,"calling on your proof.please supply that which you have chosen to accept as proof, since you cannot provide any actual real proof."

5/23/2010,"this is so very true, but we all knew that beforehead."
5/23/2010,"aw man, don't you people have any decency? natana, you accuse me of not treating the playerbase with enough respect and now you lower yourself to the same level only to take a few cheap shots at me?"
5/23/2010,"elaborate.in null we can tackle a supercap with 4 methods (granted, deployable bubbles really only work in specific circumstances). in lowsec we have one, the (focused) hic. this leaves supercarriers more powerful in lowsec than in nullsec. this is before even considering the likely hood of a counter-drop. for example, dropping a lone supercarrier in nullsec typically gets the attention of locals who actually have the means to take the ship out, lowsec alliances and corps rarely have the means to deal with this. i do not see this as a particular problem, however i do see the limitations in tackling methods as an issue, as it is considerably harder to keep one pinned while the tackler batphones allies for backup. i'm not experienced with doomsday mechanics enough to have a legitimate position on their allowance in lowsec, however my position on supercarriers is that something balance-wise should be addressed to reduce the effectiveness of supercarriers while in lowsec. perhaps not allowing fighter-bombers to be launched would be the solution.as to there being more supercarrier losses in lowsec, i feel that this is mostly from the increased usage of solo to few supercarriers in lowsec as to nullsec. much easier to hotdrop in lowsec without having to worry about the danger from standard dictor bubbles, leads to ****y pilots, leads to dead supercarriers.also, i know you're intimately experienced with being on the hot-dropping end of lowsec supercaps, do you feel that your stance on this issue comes from solid reasoning on game balance or from a personal interest in things staying as they are?"
5/23/2010,"this part is a little misleading. there are 4 methods, i suppose, but one involves anchorable bubbles and two involve a hic. realistically the only difference is that one cannot use standard dictors in lowsec, and you can't **** cage a pos (though i wouldn't really consider that tackling in the same sense). so yes, it is slightly harder to tackle supers in low sec, as i know far too well having missed tackle on a leviathan and a wyvern (i swear they all had nomads and i-stabs), because i can't drop a bubble. but at the same time, low-sec has no jump bridge network, no cyno beacon networks, and no cyno jammers. i bolded that last part because it's kind of a big deal. i think this is slightly fallacious reasoning. i would not, for example, drop a nyx randomly in delve to shoot some dude. is it because i'm afraid that someone in a dictor will be around and drop a bubble on me? not really. it's the same reason i didn't fly to h-w last week in a drake - i would have been far from support and it would have been pretty stupid of me to fly 40 jumps when i could have just gone 5, not because i was afraid of a dictor catching me. until h-w, and before pl laid waste to some careless supers, there were more supercarrier deaths in low-sec than in 0.0 since the change. even taking those into consideration, i think it's about even - which is pretty telling. ok, but for the sake of continuity dreads shouldn't be able to siege and carriers shouldn't be able to triage. everything you said about supers can be said about dreads/carriers; in low-sec a sieged dread can only be tackled by a hic, why should they get special treatment? so you're arguing both that supers are more insulated from risk in low-sec, but also that it's a false sense of security. a fair question. i do enjoy me some hotdropping, but truth be told every time i've cyno'd into a system i've had a significant support presence close by. so while the perception may be that i'm exceedingly cavalier about dropping supers on anything that moves, it's pretty far from reality. some of my proposals would adversely affect my gameplay, but i feel that the changes must be made ultimately because they're imbalanced. i honestly and truthfully don't think that supers fall into this category."
5/23/2010,"i find the jump bridge network to be a fickle issue, lets say we have a similar situation in low and null. whoever the sc pilot lets say they are in 'neutral' to 'hostile' space, meaning they drop outside of their own territory and do not have a jb/gen network behind them to bring in support. in lowsec, its a neutral deal, nobody has jb/system gens's. in nullsec, there's a chance that wherever you're dropping has either a hostile bridge or a hostile generator. there are less options to move people to assist in lowsec than there are in null. by that, i'm feeling that the sc is again somewhat more powerful in lowsec than nullsec. i don't see cyno jammers as relevant to the discussion imo, if you managed to get the sc into a hostile-jammed system and get it engaged, welp... (if you could elaborate here that'd be great)honestly i'm seeing the sc losses in lowsec as a result of the false sense of security mentioned below, and thus the more common hotdrops. it's true, they're not invincible, and i think many of those losses come from people who got caught with their pants down by a prepared and ready enemy.not particularly, sieged dreads and triaged carriers can't warp out or jump out until their cycle ends, untrue of a standard sc. maybe instead of losing the fighter bomber deployment sc's lose the ewar immunity. i don't know, i'm not a game balance expert, just throwing ideas around as i see a mild imbalance. i agree, it's not particularly hard to kill a sc if you're prepared and ready to counter-drop, regardless of sec status. i'm saying that it's much less likely for them to get tackled per hot-drop (lets see if that makes any sense) in lowsec than in nullsec. i think a part of this stems from the separate issue of heavy dictors being relatively useless in lowsec pvp (aside from rsb'd hics on gates and catching supercaps). i never, ever see a roaming gang in lowsec with a hic in tow. dictor/hic in nullsec is considerably more common. just sayin.i agree, i haven't seen you (habit) guys doing that stuff personally (all of my experience is pl and ch dropping, and typically it's with 5+), though i know viper wanted to on our little carrier gang back in kor azor. well good, it's refreshing to have differing viewpoints without anyone getting nasty."

5/23/2010,"i like the evo iii though, whats the best thing honda has to offer in that category?"
5/23/2010,"the honda evil 9k1. it comes with built in driver's side machine gun racks and passenger side rocket launcher mounts. it will also come with a free 1 year subscription to guns magazine. there is also lots of room in the backseat and trunk for children/groceries. my extensive experience on the csm has given me the experience required to make these great strides in car design technology. for our european(socialist, commie) customers, we replaced the gun mounts with nerf guns to comply with gun regulation laws, but have also installed a 10 ft long front mounted lance for use in auto-jousting."
5/24/2010,supporting this and other active font-related proposals.
5/24/2010,"actually i don't think anyone truly knows how its all calculated so saying i am wrong and the wiki is wrong and you are right for a calculation that done by a server is idiotic because you don't know that either. in fact your calculation makes little sense because it crosses check sums for no logical reason.the wiki calculation makes sense because the check sums determine:1)if your turrets can track the target2)once it's determined wether you can even track the target a hit quality is generated based on sig radius vs sig resolution3)applies range(optimal, falloff) to damage outputchancetohit = 0.5 ^ ((((transversal speed/(range to target * turret tracking))*(turret signature resolution / target signature radius))^2) + ((max(0, range to target - turret optimal range))/turret falloff)^2)you calculation simply adds turret resolution when there isn't anything to support that resolution is part of the initial tracking check sum at all. if this were the case then a frigate shooting at a nano'd bs would likely still hit but that doesn't happen. in fact your formula would result in small guns have a massive damage boost against larger ships due to really high hit quality. as for the rest i don't know since you didn't actually post a formula.your formula checks stuff for no reason. why would the tracking check include signature radius and resolution at all? it doesn't(shouldn't) make your guns move faster or slower so adding that to the formula is pointless and actually counter productive as it can be gamed and makes balance extremely difficult. you track or you don't track first. that number determines the rest of the formula and for good reason. in fact the whole concept that it's considered is kinda ridiculous from a logical standpoint alone.feel free to post a link to the dev that spilled your formula though. though knowing ccp something so stupid as to include signature into tracking wouldn't be a shock at all."
5/24/2010,"megas, hypes, and rokhs are all tight fits (cpu/grid-wise). allowing them to ditch a sensor booster (netting 1 mw and 10 tf) is not going to allow a ship to add any terribly exciting modules. similarly, neither the decreased need of a tracking computer (gives 1 mw and 35 tf) or a tracking enhancer (1 mw and 15 tf) might not even free up enough for an additional t2 armor hardener. these ""freed"" slots will likely be filled with the same modules. these are not earth shattering changes. they simply give railguns a niche across the board.possible. i seem to recall one of big nerfs to drones was messing with weapons signature resolution, thus preventing medium/heavy drones from ripping apart smaller ships. however, the bulk of the targets sniper ships are shooting are as large as or larger than the sniper ship. this is usually the very reason they are at sniper range."
5/24/2010,"the formula was derived from exhaustive testing by a great many people. i've personally tested its predictive powers, and they averaged correctly every time. i'd say that it may not be exactly how its calculated, but its accurate within .1% or so. and really, all of your other concerns are easily optimized away.-liang"
5/24/2010,which formula the wiki one i posted or the tracking formula guam posted? i think the wiki one is pretty accurate myself which is why i was saying a sig res boost would bring up the dps of hybrids within a nitch that makes them good as a sniper role or at bombarding slow moving or stationary targets but still suck at tracking.while true it would still make rails more likely to have higher quality shots than other weapons. another side effect is they would be slightly better at fighting smaller ships.
5/24/2010,"in your post, you only referenced half of the dps formula - the chance to hit. the quality of those hits is determined solely by the percent chance to hit. at 50% chance to hit you will deal (iirc) 39.505% of your eft dps. at 100% chance to hit you will deal 103% of your eft dps (due to wrecking shots).it would do this by virtue of making them have much higher tracking than anyone else.-liang"
5/24/2010,"yes, but tracking and accuracy are indeed separate. the change might affect chance to hit a little but tracking would still be a primary player and you could tune it downwards a little to keep chance to hit the same. imagine it like alpha on arty except hybrid users want to slow things down or stop them to bring their accuracy to full effect(or just get a hell of a long ways away). hybrids would suffer from a sharper hit quality curve than other weapons this way. it would give them a definite flavor and tactical role that is fitting imho since the close up support for both gallante and caldari is done via missiles/drones."
5/24/2010,"so... you're suggesting to fight industrial/ratting blobs with pvp blobs and you want to reduce blobing? war of attrition sounds good and all, but you're still fighting with numbers and frankly they (industrialists) don't have those numbers to compete and the war is already won. you're better off putting a limit on the amount of people allowed in an alliance to limit their logistics for blob fleets. imagine if alliances were only allowed say 1500-2000 members: that means you wouldn't have something like sc trying to 'conquer' the north and the north by responding with a localized peace coalition against the common enemy. there's no point in having the nc if the sc is gone because you wouldn't need ridiculously sized fleets and then everyone would be in their own corner."
5/24/2010,"i believe you are completely misunderstanding the entire op.what he is saying is that they/he/whoever wants it so that an entity of 2000 members need to employ miners, ratters, production crews to ensure that their system is hard to take. what this means is that a group of 10 pilots can interrupt the mining/ratting/industry and make the system vulnerable for attack, meaning much easier to take a week or three down the road. as the index system works now, every hour there is no ratting/mining the index decays. after three days or so, you lose an entire level. give enough time, regardless of how much effort a big alliance puts up trying to defend mining ops, the defence will eventually weaken if attacked by good enough pilots. this means the attackers gank a ship or two and leaves without any losses.what the proposal does is it promotes guerrilla warfare on a new level. a big entity that wants to invade another big entity (nc vs sc i.e.) can hire smaller groups to do the dirty work for them. so when they are ready to take over a system, they can then roll in and take it in say one day instead of a week. (assuming if you drop the index levels you don't get rf timers on ihubs, stations, scu and such)you'll never get rid of the blobs, as that's simple as ""my dad will beat your dad"" and you never bring a knife etc. but it promotes smaller groups, or small groups within bigger groups that are specialized to use proper guerrilla tactics.it has nothing to do with replacing one blob mechanism with another."
5/24/2010,"my point was that they have an incentive to spam the system with industry or roams to control the system. as far as i can tell, if industry affects the ability to take a system, then just spam a ton of industry there to screw up the index. that way it'll be harder for someone to just roll in there and take it as you suggest, or in the other way, an attacker would simply spam roams to keep industry out to lower the index. i'm just not sure this would work, but i'm not a game designer so who knows."
5/24/2010,"ok, you are indeed misunderstanding it.see, the difference between what you're describing and what is suggested is basicly now and ""if"". you can already just ""spam"" the system with huge blobs or massive roams all day every day"". what is suggested is as i said, 10 pilots can do the work of hundreds."

5/24/2010,"no matter what the problem was the player has the right to petition it even if it is whinery, and that petition should be fair and balanced. this is a massive failure of the gm system, one that csm and ccp should prioritize. we cant fix broken game mechanics if the gm system breaks down before."
5/24/2010,as one of karnov's corpies i do know the inside story on this. without getting into specifics and/or pointing fingers..... basically a gm has used his powers to effectively stop this char from being used anymore. the retribution this gm has imposed on the char is far beyond the actual dmg inflicted by the char. especially considering there is no specific rule saying what was done cant be done... read the damn eula and rules before imposing such drastic measures on a char that has been playin far longer than the gm has probably been employed at ccp. i challene any gm to show me the specific rule/rules that were broken in this case. prove me wrongnuff said
5/24/2010,petition against a certain gm being delivered to the same gm is not right at all.
5/24/2010,"regardless of whether or not the op deserved the ""action against (his) character"" and regardless of whether or not petitioners can escalate a petition... a gm shouldn't be able to handle a petition against himself/herself. that isn't ethical.the op should change the wording of their post to include a proposal to not allow a gm to handle petitions filed against them."

5/24/2010,supporting this even though there is faint hope of it ever happening.
5/24/2010,qft but still supporting.
5/24/2010,"there are only a limited number of people you can throw at a problem before they start getting in each-others way; i've no interest in supporting a proposition will either result in a 'too many cooks' situation or leave the development teams (many of whom have been working separately from core development on expansions for multiple years now, such as incarna) sitting on their thumbs.ccp run fixes as they can, and while they might not prioritise them quite as much as possible, they do so while focussing on the 'dream' eve represents and while avoiding the issues come with too much focus. plus, as someone else said, it's impossible to fix everything in one go - and in my opinion, ever. this is an mmorpg, the most unstable, bug-liable genre of videogame in existence; no mmo will ever be completely 'fixed' unless it's become completely stagnant.not everyone at ccp is trained to do code repairs and an 'expansion' dedicated to optimisation without any extra elements to work on (which is basically what you're asking for, because all the expansions thus far have had new stuff and optimisations / fixes, tyrannis especially so, and the last one was an attempt at a total rework to fix older issues) would just produce a mass of redundant artists and developers.quit whining. sometimes i think ccp ought just claim to have most of their dev's focussed on optimisation with a few working on completing long-term projects - then go on as normal and watch as everyone whining about changing and adding stuff thinks they've got their way and shuts up, then fails to realise otherwise when the new 'expansion' comes out, playing up the fixes and playing down the additions.yes, there are issues to be fixed, but seriously, all these posts demanding a complete focus on fixing issues with no further development are just 'my stuff isn't fixed yet and i'm going to ignore all the evidence there are efforts to improve what's already there, so i'm going to yell about it until they stop doing other things too, thus making myself feel better'.ccp and csm, please, ignore this topic and keep on very much as you are."
5/24/2010,"this is, by no means, a proposal to stop developing new content, but a proposal to actually revisit old content and make it complete. nobody wants ccp to stop going further, quite the contrary, but what do ever new stepping stones help you, if the road you built crumbles behind you? so stop whining about something that has not been said nor is intended"
5/24/2010,"when you revamp current problems, marketing can push the changes.buff lowsec with some ideas presented in the ""outlaw"" csm thread, it's new content.update the ~50% of useless afs and advertise lowsec piracy and ""epic speed arcs""use hacking and to give clues to hidden abc belts, even some very rare ones in hisec but more common in lowsec. or maybe unlock a bpc, who knows?buff black ops and highlight covert operatons, give them a means to subvert the enemy behind lines- maybe even adjust/shorten rf timers on stations. i dunno, lots to play with here.the point is, improving current half-finished content can easily be shown as new content.. hell every foot product comes with a ""new and improved"" version, or a new car model of the same type."
5/24/2010,exactly
5/24/2010,"honestly would be nice to have a short update on the status of each, if not actually have these fixes rolled out. a dev blog with ""top proposals in assembly hall and what has come of them"" would be fantastic.edit: supporting fixing them as well. obviously."

5/24/2010,except without a doubt the place i click most is on the jump and warp buttons which has nothing to do with ui...
5/24/2010,"doubt this is going anywhere but the ccp blackhole. clicks is only a sub-set of a much larger ui issue and tbh, i'd rather ccp looks at it holistically as whole over fixing/patching parts that may need to get re-done at a later date. there are many many many many (x42) things that needs to be relooked at from s&i, ship navigation, overview, probing, market, contracts, wallets, hangar and etc. one of my pet peeve is the way gun ammo selection works. it's a nightmare. the gun grouping was sort of a half-baked solution that only partially addresses it half-way by working around the gun numbers. the core is still bad.anyway, thumbs up."
5/24/2010,invention need some sort of batch job processing where a batch job only takes up 1 'slot'. also the invention interface needs to remember preferences.pi seems to be a very bad click sink. streamlining needs to be looked at to reduce this. industry interface in general needs to remember my preferences for things.
5/24/2010,it is not hording space. it is our protective border and should be useful. the closer you let the enemy get the more dangerous it becomes for us and our friends.my proposal would give a reason for blues to be there and thus beef up our border protection. killing two birds with one stone.attackers have too many advantages as it is and these perks would bring better balance to invaders vs. defenders.
5/24/2010,"yes, you are hoarding space and if you really want a blue to your alliance to come next to you, then do it. have them come up and provide space between you and your enemies and they can pay for their sov and ihub. the only thing you're obviously using those systems for is just space between alliances. put other people friendly to you that support those systems themselves, and you get a better wall than just space.stop crying."

5/24/2010,"reading this thread can cause imminent rage and a pulse of over9000! i was wrong! don't waste your time reading this!------------------------------[tl;dr: scroll to the bottom of the 2nd post]note: english is not my native language, but i try my very best :)hii'd like to be able to switch to exp and/or kinetic damage with lasers. being not able to do so is a huge disadvantage compared to other races for different reasons:from the pve perspective (tl;dr below):i currently have 17m sp and fly amarr ships. from running missions with my abaddon (if i include my implants, it's like all skills 5 in eft damage-wise without implants), i know it's a total pain to fight everything else than blood raiders, drones and sanshas (if i get lucky and they don't tracking disrupt like mad :x). especially fighting angels is a pain. in the time i kill 1 angel bs, i can kill 3-4 or more sansha bs, and due to my low resists against exp/kin, this single angel bs dishes out as much damage as the sansha bs all together. i also have to switch out 2 heatsinks for 2 additional hardeners when fighting angels, resulting in even less damage output. guristas and serpentis have thermal as second lowest resists, lasers do have thermal damage you may say, but actually only on short range crystals. without max skills, multifrequency l range on non-apoc amarr bs is 17km(+13) with mega pulse ii, and 33(+25)km with ridiculous cap and pg using tachyon beam laser ii. guristas and some serpentis bs tend to orbit at ~51 km. on top of that, they still shoot into an amarr resistance hole with kinetic damage.the problem with that is: i want to go to 0.0, doing mainly pvp but also ratting/plexing to have some variation. to do pve effectively, i have to go for blood raider or drone space, maybe sansha but tracking disruptors are still a problem (and no, even 2 tracking computers won't help against 6 tracking disrupting cruisers like in sansha blockade lvl4 or sansha plexes :< ). so, due to my laser damage types, i've limited places to go. from corporation recruitement, caod and dotlan evemaps i know, that the tiny blood raider space (compared to guristas for example) is owned by a huge alliance with closed or very-high-sp-pilots only recruitement, and the sansha and drone regions are either ruled by russian-speaking- and/or carebear-alliances and/or alliances with high sp requirements. tl;dr pve perspectiveevery other race can switch damage types to effectively rat/plex all across eve, amarr can't and amarr gunboat pilots are therefore handicapped when running missions and limited in regions when searching for a 0.0 corp/alliance."
5/24/2010,"from the pvp perspective (tl;dr below):basically all amarr t1 ships are armor tankers.gallente: can switch to all damage types due to drones, and deal balanced amounts of kin/therm weapon damage at long and close range. kinetic is the second lowest resist on all armortanking t1 ships, directly followed by thermal. vice versa for shield tankers.caldari: can switch to all damage types using missiles, kinetic is mainly used, missiles don't need cap. as mentioned above, kinetic is shooting into an armortanker resistance hole. using same guns as gallente.minmatar: can switch to all damage types, including exp/kin ammo, being the absolute worst for armor tankers. guns need no capacitor.amarr: dealing mainly em and a really tiny amount of thermal damage at long range. at close range, amarr deal a balanced amount of em\therm damage. em is good against shield tankers, but due to the fact that most shield tankers don't need cap for their weapons, they can permarun active hardeners and/or active repair modules and they also have a passive recharge. against armor tankers, the em damage is more or less completely useless, because it's the highest resist. thermal damage, where a fair amount is only dealt when using low range crystals, is the second lowest resist for shield tankers, but for armor tankers the 2nd highest.tl;dr pvp perspectiveif you try to shoot an armor tanker with lasers, it's like biting on granite. even shield tankers can be really tough due to non-cap needing weapon systems and active hardeners and repairers. (drake for example lol...) things are getting even worse on t2 ships, where some ships have (example: jaguar) a em/thermal _base_ resistance of shield 75/60% and armor 90/67.5% in addition to their high speed which makes them even difficult to hit, vagabond e.g. (lasers have the lowest tracking of all guns except artillery). everyone piloting something else than a laser boat could say, doesn't matter, i switch to exp or kin and smoke him. amarr can't.tl;dr /conclusionamarr lasers can switch crystals instantly, allowing them to mostly shoot in optimal range, and they don't have to reload. what is this good for if you don't deal any damage because you often have to shoot into the opponent's highest resists?lasers have the worst tracking of all guns except artillery lasers need a huge amount of cap where most other weapon systems don't need any cap or far less, significantly limiting the versatility of amarr ships compared to othersamarr can rat/plex effectively in blood raider and drone regions. maybe in sansha-regions too if tracking disruption isn't too heavy. due to that, amarr pilots who want to do pve, have limited options on finding a suitable 0.0 corp/alliance.the last one currently is personally my biggest problem. please tell me if i missed something or got something wrong. to be able to go to 0.0 where i want to do some pve, too, to have a variation to pvp, i've to either train for another race's bs including t2 weapons which would take months or learn russian which would take years. maybe ccp should add a note on character creation that says ""if you don't speak russian, you currently won't have much fun when trying to find a 0.0 corp living in a region where you can pve in a laserboat"" :/yours disappointed disturbed lucy"
5/24/2010,"[sarcasm] minmatar weapons do so little em damage, it's almost worthless to fight them. the emp rounds do explosive, which they're highly resistant to, and proton damage (which does em and therm) have a horrible damage.[/sarcasm]honestly, the amarr were whining for a long time about the damage output of their guns. the devs boosted the abilities of amarr weapons not once but twice. now, pulse lasers do some really disgustingly powerful damage, even with high resists.amarr have many advantages to compensate for their lasers' damage-specific weaknesses (increased cap size, no ammunition needed, etc). also, many amarr ships can use missiles and/or drones.seems pretty balanced to me. my minmatar character can take out angels well, but has trouble with sansha/blood. each race has it's balancing factor.not supported."
5/24/2010,i'm sorry but the op screams and drips of epic fail-ness/noobness.just look at the number of armarrian gank ships out there.what they lack for in damage types they make up for in sheer dps.please... do your homework and stop whining.if you want to complain about something.. tell ccp to fix the tech2/faction crystal glitch in grouped weapons (reload)... lets start there first. : o pi swear... half these guys embarrass us amarrian pilots.
5/24/2010,"wohoo instead of some constructive comments, you guys throw rocks at me, nice one... #1 every race has its gank ships... #2 wow that made sense... srsly, did you ever do pvp? try to fight an armortanked cane or a drake with a harbinger. good luck and don't forget to insure it.#3 you are not the op in this thread- amarr actually need cap for their guns (lots of it), so increased cap is more a balancing factor than an advantage- it has a reason why people fit no cap using autocannons on all amarr ships that don't give a laser damage boost (e.g. punisher, prophecy, arbitrator,....)"
5/24/2010,"i actually thought their replies were much less sarcastic than what you would normally get for such a proposal. i guess your definition of ""constructive"" is ""i agree wholeheartedly! here's a thumbs up!!!""not supported, for reasons previously stated. (i'm caldari, currently starting an amarr dualspec)"
5/24/2010,"gallente blaster boats also use both cap and ammo with a fixed damage type, and amarr can use drones as well. also the only gallente bs that is made to use drones as its main weapon is the domi.for pvp if you gave lasers selective damage type on top of everything else it would be the only weapon choice, and your the dps from you guns should be enough for pve."
5/24/2010,"the only complaint i have with amarr ships is that god awful cap usage bonus on most of them instead of an actual weapon bonus (damage/rof/range...). that crap bonus leads to things like the autocannon punisher which does more damage and uses less cap than the ""bonused"" pulse lasers. the damage output and tanking abilities of amarr ships with proper bonuses are just fine."
5/24/2010,1: so you just blew apart your own argument by admitting there are very powerful pvp ship fits. sounds like someone needs to do there homework.2: that's funny... i know quite a few harby pilots who are quite good at what they do. learn to research before speaking.3: what are you talking about? i was making a suggestion of a valid problem... unlike you splattering the boards with epic fail whinery.
5/24/2010,"harbis melt most ships they are shooting in short order. nothing should have a ""win"" button, i.e. nothing should be able to defend against everything and kill everything. that's fairly central to eve. for every armor-tanked ship that you run into, there is a shield-tanked ship that is cursing your em damage.complaining about not having high enough resists against a specific damage type is ridiculous, if you are worried about it, fit your ship accordingly. the abaddon has an insane armor tank.amarr can use drones and missiles just like gallente and caldari have ships that are stuck with thermal/kinetic damage (hybrid weapons)."
5/24/2010,uhm ... not supported.you seriously have no clue what you are talking about.
5/24/2010,"every race's weapons have weaknesses. a fixed damage type is hardly unique - most caldari ships are locked into kinetic damage, gallente do almost entirely thermal/kinetic, and minmatar are fairly flexible but still have a lot of forced explosive and/or kinetic. find me another race who gets a battleship with 62km range on its short-range guns without any range modules, and i might begin to think that you might be hard done by."
5/24/2010,amarr is fine. gallente is the one that needs fixing.
5/24/2010,"ok cool you guys don't get it or just don't want to... does anyone of you have any experience with amarr gunboats at all? or is this more like a ""i can't fly amarr ships so don't buff them""-smack? an armor tanked hurricane can kill every other bc and most battleships solo, how about that hm?i didn't complain about resists, i just mentioned them. it's true that the abaddon has a real nice tank, especially in pvp when using buffertank. but in pve when fighting angels it's a bad joke, even with 3 expl 1 kin hardener (only 2 heatsinks left, yay) and a faction lar in angel extra 4.every race can use drones, but no amarr bs or bc has a damage boost on drones, so it's more like a ""nice-to-have"" thing than a primary weapon for all races besides gallente. amarr only have some t2 ships that can use missiles (sacrilege and damnation, both ships have a strong tank rather than high dps). no battleship or at least bc can use missiles. the mainly used weapons on most amarr ships are lasers.-----and how about pve guys hm?maybe i didn't make things simple enough...sansha/blood/drones: em/therm weaknessdamage can be dealt by: amarr em/therm, minmatar em, caldari therm guns and em or therm missiles on some ships (raven e.g.) , gallente therm guns + dronesguristas/serpentis: kin/therm weaknessdamage dealt by: amarr therm (close range crystals only), caldari kin/therm guns and kin missiles, gallente kin/therm guns + drones)angels: exp/kin weaknessdamage dealt by: amarr exp+kin not possible, caldari kin guns and missiles, gallente kin guns and drones----well, i didn't expect much/any support on my thoughts, because most pilots fly everything else than amarr ships. lowsec is full of caldari, gallente and especially minmatar ships. so why buff something that you can't fly? at least i hoped for some constructive arguments/posts that actually have a content but i guess people on this forum are as stupid as in <enter random mmo forum here>."
5/24/2010,"i'm a pretty well max skilled amarr pilot, and i'm going to go with ""you're wrong"". even armor tanked ships go down pretty fast. and if you think drakes are lolariously hard to break with em damage, try doing it with explosive. tbh, all the weapons systems save hybrids are fairly well balanced these days. i can't in good conscience support your proposal.-liang"
5/24/2010,why do i have a feeling that you were in the battleship and someone else was in the cane?
5/24/2010,"nice, finally an answer without flames thank you !actually nobody is forced to shoot shield tankers with explosive. and because you mentioned explosive, i think you mean drake vs cane for example. a cane can run dual neuts to turn off the drake's hardeners because their guns don't need cap. i can't comment on hybrid weapons or why they need tweaking, i've to admit that i'm not into that. the only things i see are hyperion and dominix pvp videos, where these ships crush whole gangs solo. ok, but back to topic:to conclude the statements posted above, you all think lasers are good for pvp. ok, now what is with pve? nobody wrote a comment on that yet. and i stated it the biggest reason for my proposal to revamp lasers."
5/24/2010,"you sir are ******* but i'll explain it just for you:cane mwd's to bs at close range, neut it, kill it. think before flaming..."
5/24/2010,"forgot to support my own post. as for dividing eve into constituencies, that would be nigh impossible to do properly."
5/24/2010,"by ""free"" i meant free of real world currency. in game currency has no value, can be generated in infinite quantities and is easily acquired. i am well aware that some people purchase isk with real world money. those people are stupid and fail to grasp the concept of ""video game."" nice try though."
5/24/2010,"the following changes would be an excellent addition to fw and i think woul encourange more people to join fw1. allow all of empire to be conquered by whichever faction you are in, this can lead to alot of fun ops that can be offensive or defensive, imagine gallente navy assaulting jita ;)2. allow pirate factions to be involved, sometimes the 4 main empires just arent enough, with the recent invasions from sansha surely i should be allowed to join them and claim empire in their name.i think if we expand on fw we can make it really interesting ofc it wont be as easy as 'hmm lets go conquer jita' and sec status of a system will have a major impact on that place."
5/24/2010,lol those ideas are so crazy they may be actually fun and even work even though it would screw all mission runners over because if someone has low standings with lets say gallente and jita changes to gallente sov then they'll get all killed by the navy =oactually i think the navy should be pure player driven would be a lot more fun =d crazy ~o~
5/24/2010,"you don't know what you're talking about... occupancy is not sov. the reason gallente ""lost"" all their occupancy at one point is because of a difference in pay for doing so. an attempt to gain occupancy is based on pve. caldari pilots get paid billions of isk per character for each attempt to gain occupancy. gallente pilots don't really get paid at all. gallente pilots get paid to pvp, the same as the other factions, but the pvp is secondary to gaining occupancy. and the best part is that because that ccp screwed up the balance between fw rewards and gallente 'lost,' ccp decided to punish everyone who missions for gallente. yup, if you're a gallente misison runner you get storylines that send you deep into fw lowsec in a mission running ship where you have zero chance of accomplishing your mission.fw is a lot more broken than ""make a bigger mess of it"" will fix. not supported."
5/24/2010,"wtf are you going on about? and what does it have to do with the op?anyways op, i honestly like the idea of taking over empires and such, a gal assault on jita would be awesome. that said i'd rather push for fw changes that would actually be conceivably done by ccp."

5/24/2010,"a simple proposal, really. certain npcs use too much electronic warfare and it's too effective compared to the methods available to counter it, or even compared to player electronic warfare capability. this is especially problematic if you don't mission in a fof raven or an afk dominix fit, because the e-war will ensure that, even if you can tank the mission perfectly fine, it'll take you forever to finish it. getting cycle-disrupted by sanshas so you never have an optimal range longer than 10km with tachyons using aurora (which just happened to me in a mission; i couldn't use guns for 35 of the 45 minutes it took me to finish because i couldn't hit anything), being jammed for five minutes by guristas, and having your battleship sensor-damped to a lock range of 12km are all things that are familiar to many mission-runners. it's no real coincidence why the most popular mission fits are those that are most resistant to e-war.what's further, the ships that use the most electronic warfare are also typically the ones that are hardest to kill (and their dps isn't too shabby either) which runs counter to player e-war ability. additionally, npcs use the old, unmodified, pre-script versions of e-war that are far, far more effective than player versions, meaning that there's more of them using a more effective version of it on tougher ships compared to what players are capable of. they also never run out of capacitor and seem to have a far longer optimal range than a player and a much longer cycle time, while being highly resistant to e-war themselves. if there's enough of them, they will cripple your ability to respond.this is more of an annoyance than a problem now, but if the improved sleeper ai gets applied to these missions, resistance to electronic warfare is going to be more important than dps tanking ability when it comes to running missions.how to modify this? a few proposals, mix and match them to taste.1) reduce the likelihood of an npc using electronic warfare. this reduces the odds of getting jammed, disrupted, or dampened for protracted periods of time.2) remove electronic warfare from most existing vessels and add new npc electronic warfare vessels. these vessels would use electronic warfare, but would not have the same dps output or tank that the current electronic warfare ships do, making them easier to kill and putting them more in line with player electronic warfare ships.3) reduce the number of e-war-capable npcs in missions, replacing them with more standard vessels that lack e-war capability but have similar damage and tank. this keeps the incoming damage and difficulty consistent while making more ships more viable for running it.4) bring npc tracking disruption and sensor dampening up to date. reduce their overall effectiveness to be in-line with unscripted modules, or change them to affect only one attribute - either tracking speed or optimal range, for instance, but not both."
5/24/2010,"so to boil it down:instead of adapting to meet the capabilities of your mission foes (which, btw, as a mission runner you can look up ahead of time), you want to make missions even easier to finish.don't get me wrong, i'm a mission ***** too - i love lots of iskies for little really labor or worry. but the mission rats you're discussing nerfing are the ones that actually make missions more than just ""point-click-collect cash"" (and let's face it, they're not much above that anyway, but the isk must flow, as they say).i can't support this. there are already ways to defeat the ewar capabilities of these ships (which you even acknowledge in your opening post) including one you failed to mention - friends. friends in other ships can make short work of enemy ships that are busy target jamming your ultra tanked fotm."
5/24/2010,"wts - sensor booster, eccm, tracking enhancer, etc..."
5/24/2010,"dont want to stop you ... but you cant counter rat jamming. they have some unbelievable high jamming strength. we tried it with a cnr and 3 remote eccm.and the tracking disrupting is really sick, same goes for the remote sensor boosting. with 4-5 remote sensor damps you might get 20km with a sensor booster. same goes for tracking enhancers dont really help against sansha disrupting in some missions.a little balance with the player e-war might be really nice.npcs also still have 90% webs. (wtb)"
5/24/2010,"npc ewar is also not stacking nerfed. i've had a targeting range go from 120km to ~6km. there's pretty much nothing you can do in this situation except wait for your drones to finish the mission, use fofs, or bring a friend.i usually bring a friend alt.-liang"
5/24/2010,"i'll support this in one narrow sense. i only want them to have the same ew capabilities that player ships have. npcs have been cheating bastards for far too long. but heavy ew in missions, while annoying, is fine. if it really bugs you that much, just fight angels."

5/24/2010,"would be nice, and i can't imagine this being too hard to do."
5/24/2010,quit crying people are gonna vote for who they want to vote for. how would you display the list
5/24/2010,"nice theory, though it ignores that the last couple of csms only had unknown people with no real forum track records running due to the term limits.if you think previous csm candidates didn't have solid programs then you likely have only paid attention the last couple elections when the bottom of the dregs were running. this election had all the big names running with programs that were reminiscent of the first csm, and that is why we've seen a resurge.so your theory on why the turnout was low is not so easily explained by mere easy access, etc.and if you think null sec alliances are the ones that are counterproductive and difficult to work with, then you haven't read csm meeting transcripts much. it's invariably the 'independent' candidates that are difficult to deal with, while even alliances like the goons had elected members that were rational and cooperative.there's surprisingly little faction based rivalry... likely cause people who live in 0.0 sec alliances are used to having codependent relationships with people.it's actually been shown scientifically that being on top of a ballot gives you a certain percentage more votes. there's even a funny story about a local election in canada where someone lower on the ballot decided to enter a fictional person in the race so that her rival wouldn't get that bump.which really brings up the question why aren't ballots printed in randomized order in real election to remove this advantage."
5/24/2010,"normally i hate democracy, but there are two things that caused me to vote in this csm when i had not voted in any of the previous ones. firstly, the advertisements on the login screen. secondly, the ease with which i was able to find information on the various candidates right on the voting page. sadly, many of them did not have any information displayed, but i read through those who did and was able to make a reasonably informed decision on my vote. (only one candidate mentioned trade and the market in their little blurb info.)i'm not a regular forum user. personally, i dislike forums for reasons i'm not gonna go into. those two little changes made a big difference in changing my opinion about voting."
5/24/2010,"i was going to just call you a troll and let it be but since this is going on eve-search for evah, and others might find it some day and may wonder the same thing genuinly, i'm actually going to bother looking up some proof for you:general information about csmmembers of csm4many other important linkscsm4 iceland meeting minutesxhagen's blog about csm4future of the csm"
5/24/2010,see that little spike at may 10th that lasted a few days? it could be a complete coincidence but may 10th was the day we did a big csm candidate roundup at massively in an effort to get more people voting. maybe it had an effect!
5/24/2010,i'm pretty certain that the massively article helped with the increased voter turnout. for comparison my site went from 3000 to 8000 hits per day for the three days after that article (there was also a 3 day bump to about 4500 hits a day when the voting opened and a similar 5 day bump just before polls closed).many thanks for putting together the article
5/24/2010,"yup, sorry i forgot to mention that in my earlier post on things that influenced voter turnout--your article certainly helped. i notice that my blog got double its normal traffic that day. traffic then tapered off from that high over the next couple of days back to normal. thanks!"
5/24/2010,"i already said it elsewhere, but yes, that probably helped a lot and i found it to be pretty accurate overall. thanks for the effort"
5/24/2010,i'm just curious on the percentual outcome on casted votes per candidate in the days that the list was a static one compared to the casted votes when thy randomised the candidates.did it prove my case or not?
5/24/2010,"it's been established several times that in rl elections, the top of the list gets more votes simply because of them being on top..whether it carries over to eve i don't know but i doubt it will have made a significant impact on these elections. (results pending..)"
5/24/2010,i've definitely seen a very tangible number of hits on my candidacy page having massively as a referer... so i'd say it did.
5/24/2010,"wonderful, an article that largely dismissed 2 thirds of the candidates brought in a sizable bump to the voter roles. by dismissed i mean that the organizational method was to group candidates together was, past members of the csm, new people, people with no information.past csm members already have an advantage and by listing them first it gave them yet another one. with information overload do to the high number of candidates the first few listed would be looked over and the further a candidate was on the list the more likely the reader would have decided to stop.i made the same comment on the thread about the article. to be honest, it's not like there is a better method of presenting such a large number of candidates. in the future it should be easier. ankh and the take care party are a sign of things to come, political parties for the csm. the parties themselves will edit down the potential candidate list.i will also put forward the question, why are candidates with no information even listed in voting?while i have no issue with someone not making a major campaign effort it is somewhat confusing that you would have a candidate with nothing beyond a name. these type of ""empty shirts"" got less then 100 votes in the last election. that is a number of votes that tell me they attracted no one but their in game friends/contacts.should ccp enlist a slightly tighter restriction on the csm candidates? i don't see how a candidate can garnish enough votes to be elected if they do not even post any candidate information at all. if someone can not even put, ""vote for me"" in the campaign info window, how could they be a good candidate for csm? if they can not tap their keyboard 11 times to post a message i don't see how they would find the energy to put for the the effort to be an effective csm member.on the flip side you have the slippery slope, once you restrict the candidates where will it end? well, at least my prattling will end here..."

5/25/2010,"not really. let's take a look at the formula:chancetohit = 0.5 ^ ((((transversal speed/(range to target * turret tracking))*(turret signature resolution / target signature radius))^2) + ((max(0, range to target - turret optimal range))/turret falloff)^2)lets simplify this a bit. the part of the formula we really care about:(transversal speed/(range to target * turret tracking))*(turret signature resolution / target signature radius)a bit friendlier notation...= transv / (range * tracking) * sigres / sig radiusnote that the equations aren't bounded by any piecewise functions (such as min/max):= tranv * sig res / (range * tracking * sig radius)holding transv, range, and sig radius constant (as one would when seeing how the formula would be different for the same shot...)= c * sig res / trackingof course the value of c is immaterial since it would be the same whether you had higher tracking or lower sig res. and, this makes tons of sense since high tracking and low sig resolutions both contribute to more hits. so really lowering sig res (400 -> 350 or something) is exactly equivalent to an equivalent increase in tracking.and since hit quality is determined solely based on hit chance, we can see that increasing sig res would have no more effect on hit quality than an increase in tracking.hope this helps.-lianged: going back and reading goum's post a bit closer: he's right. this is just another way to show it.ed: it also occurs to me that a big part of your complaint was that everything was so self referential in goum's formula. this is easily solved by having a precalculated variable before doing the main calculation. and really, i wouldn't be surprised if someone told me it was all done by table lookup."
5/25/2010,"grrr looking at it you're right. god i hate this broken system.if it was broken into check separate check sums not only could you lower server load but you could make a more realistic system that would give hybrids an accuracy nitch like i was thinking.instead of the current equations have something like:chancetohit1 = (transversal speed/(range to target * turret tracking))chancetohit2 = ((turret signature resolution / target signature radius)if it's a hit then:damage = ((turret signature resolution / target signature radius) + ((range to target - turret optimal range))/turret falloff)misses wouldn't do as much calculation. i guess this is a simplified version of what i would prefer though as i would prefer no range(up to 250km) where sig res and radius are calculated properly based on distance rather than an object being the same size regardless of how far or close it is. then gunnery would have an additional primary mechanic to balance the three separate systems with.each system with strengths and weaknesses but adding accuracy as a strength to hybrids(rails at least) would make them more viable while the others could be weaker in this catagory. lasers the weakest because they are pretty much the best weapon system in the game and because from a story standpoint the minmatar were once renowned for the quality of their machinery.anyways, that ain't gonna happen."

5/25/2010,"intro: some of you are aware that ccp wants to remove those, but they are still searching for a solution which would benefit the most players. so i meditated and figured out solution. which is easy to program and implement. and which will not make people angry. solution1. add 10 points + 10% to all characters attributes 10 points is the value of maxed learning skills, 10% is a bonus to value gained by maxed learning skill.2. remove all learning skills.like they never existed.3. sp which player had been invested in learning will be redistributed through faster learning time lets say 10000% faster.lets say for example you have 4m sp in learning. you will get bonus to sp accumulation with a same value. so you will not lose any sp but it would be redistributed to your current skill plan in total value which would be exactly the same as the sp value in learning.that would of course would be different from player to player, not everyone have all learning skill maxed so its only fair to receive as much as you had invested.now, the question is:would you be totally satisfied with this change?"
5/25/2010,please ccp hurry up and do this!/signed
5/25/2010,good solutioni also think it would be reasonable to give all characters an extra +5 to all attributes and either remove the 1-5 implants or use them entirely for stat/skill bonus's like the current sets work./signed
5/25/2010,"supportedccp already has the tech in place to allow for accelerated skillpoint gains up to a set limit so it should be possible to implement this.problem is you'll still have people whining, they ""you should have to do it because i had to"" mentality, but then some people are never happy.this solution deals with learning skills while at the same time giving a return to those who originalaly invested in the skills."
5/25/2010,"what about the sp i would have gained had i had the learning skills from day 1 as new players then effectively would? you forgot to account for that.a better solution is, just remove the learning skills and tell anyone who complains to stfu.best solution is stfu about the learning skills."

5/25/2010,not supportedone of the unique features of eve is specialization. learning skills are part of it.
5/25/2010,"supported, learning skills were always bad game design. better to remove them late than never. i would also have no problems with those sp simply vanishing with no reimbursement."
5/25/2010,"i've weighed in n the learning skills argument before, and i'm still on the same side now. there's nothing wrong with learning skills.what needs to be changed is people's perception of their neccessity, but that would require changing the basic human nature of min/maxing in games where possible.so i will simply say what i have always said:you do not need to train learning skills, not even to be competitive, especially in the short term.let's face it, if two characters are facing off against each other in combat and they both have a total of 5 million skill points in the points relevant to that particular fight, does it really matter how long it took them to accumulate those skill points? of course not - what will matter is how the points are applied - iow, the player's skill at effectively using those points to reach the desired outcome. i would say that, if anything, the character that took longer getting there has an adavantage, because he has had more of an opportunity to hone the skills required to effectively apply those points.what learning skills do is allow for a margin of error. they allow your opponent to mis calculate, instead of being able to look at a character and go ""oh he's six months old, he has exactly x skill points"". you can still do that, but there's a wider margin of error because you're not sure how much learning he has applied, which shifts the total up or down.not supported."
5/25/2010,"ccp needs to just chop the learning skills. people who complain need to htfu. if you've trained them, you've already experienced the faster skill training and benefited from it. if you haven't trained it yet, you are a noob and shouldn't be faced with a month of skills that exist for no other reason than to train skills.edit: i will, however, support anything (within reason) that axes the learning skills."
5/25/2010,"not supported.learning skills are a love them to hate them set of skills. you always want to put them in cue but they take forver. by putting them in cue, you are speeding up skill learning for later.i say dont add more - dont get rid of them.if you dont want to skill them - then dont.m."
5/25/2010,to those who didn't support: do remember that ccp decided that those skills will be removed. we dont discuss here should they be removed or not.they still are not removed because ccp didn't find solution which would satisfy majority of players.
5/25/2010,"imo, we should just cut the skills and htfu about it. but, i'll support this if for no other reason than to get learning skills out of the game. they exacerbate the sp inadequacy problems new players feel.if they focus on learning skills: they don't have fun for like two months in the game. wtfm8?if they don't: i'm literally outrunning them on learning new crap, and they feel like i'm pulling even further ahead by the day.-liang"
5/25/2010,"link?i remember 1 dev saying once, 4 years ago, that he personally didn't like learning skills."
5/25/2010,"learaning skills are stupid. it's an absolutely dumb game mechanic that drives potential new players out of the game. the question i have been asked repeatedly by my real life gaming friends is, ""spend money and how much time on this?"" i fully support this or any plan that get's rid of learning skills."
5/25/2010,"i don't think it makes a difference if one supports this or not, ccp recognizes and is aware of the problem, they simply haven't come up with a solution. it's in their best interest to do so and it will probably eventually happen. csm time is better spent on other things.(it has no impact on my argument, but i think the skills are an absolutely dreadful game design mistake. one which is understandable, and understandably hard to correct. which kind of makes them interesting for those of us interested in such things.)"
5/25/2010,"a buddy of mine who is smart enough to fully grasp this idea says its a good solution. so i guess i'm on board :) i never thought learning skills made much sense. of course, i could say the same of many things in eve, but this seems like one ccp might actually fix for a change."

5/25/2010,"i'm going to quote you since it's a lot easier. you're simply misunderstanding me. what i'm saying is this whole thing is an incentive to just simply blob each other.alliance a invades alliance b with say 10 people in 3 systems. alliance b fails to utilize decent amount of industry and ratting within said systems and thus they are quite easily taken.alliance b realizes that through using more ratters and industry in those systems, they can withstand an invading force for much longer and thus does so.here's the problem: ok, so you can roam with a few people and put a squeeze on their systems and it (at first!) promotes small gang warfare. however, to off-set the oncoming force, alliance b decides to start spamming more industry and ratting with a militia of equal or greater size than the roam to protect their industry and squash the invaders. alliance a can either at this point go home, or continue with their planned invasion and thus start spamming more forces to counter-balance the defending alliance b. either you're going have a huge incentive to blob or you're going to have a defending pushover alliance that will just collapse at an incoming invasion. what choice do you think they have?so really you are replacing one blob with another, however only in anticipation of the blobs that were planned to invade in the coming future. the only thing that is changed is forcing corporations/alliances to use their systems more to an advantage or get stamped out if they choose not to. sure small gang warfare makes sense, however they're going to defend themselves and so many pilots can only do so much. not sure how only a few pilots roaming a system can take on an empire..."
5/25/2010,"you've clearly never pushed a force that tries to protect it's industry before. it doesn't matter who it is. at one point, people will be too bored to sit there for nothing, defending miners. and while they're defending a mining op, the skirmish force can kill people elsewhere, making them whine that all the defence is assembled in one spot. it also enables a skirmish gang to bomb the ""blob"" defending the mining op. hell, you can bomb the mining op itself and run away with no losses, furthermore decreasing morale.people need to stop using a blob as an excuse for everything, and rather start thinking what one might do while being outnumbered. it's very easy for 10 people to take out 100 hulks protected by 600 military ships. you just need to know how."
5/25/2010,"but isn't this what we want? what is fun? it begins with a small force attacking industrialists, another small force moves in to intercept them. this then escalates to larger and larger forces until you have an all out war over the system.this differs from today where all of a sudden you get a spike of 500 ships jumping into the system proceeding directly to the ihub and decimating it in a few seconds. that force then has to sit there doing nothing waiting for either the timer to run out or the owners of the system to get a fleet ready which will take hours. there is just no ""interaction"" which should be the fun part.in my suggestion you get a trickle of people coming in from both sides, slowly escalating the battle. and at any one time the attackers can decide that their offensive capabilities are better used somewhere else and may withdraw to annoy another system, or split out over several systems."
5/25/2010,"yes, i absolutely agree, it shouldn't be an excuse, but my point still stands: they will use this as another means to blob a system. the current suggestion sounds great in that at first will encourage small roams to clear front line systems in enemy territory since i notice a lot of systems are hardly used by large alliances. however there comes a point where one group has to decide whether to defend it or not in terms of the proposed index.perhaps it is better to go more along with something like what has been suggested for fw sov where each ship is worth a certain number of points and you 'weaken' the system given the losses of the defending team. also, have it so the more ships that blob the opposing force, the less points are added/taken to the teams. it seems this way, you still will see blobing, however there is a better incentive to fight with less numbers and to be more careful with their ships.thoughts?"

5/25/2010,"supported, but also with a barrier (confirmation box) for the ""cancel order"" option - it's something that is rarely used so that having to click ""yes"" each time you actually do want to cancel an order (with the option to remember that setting like jumping into low/null) won't be a big hassle."
5/25/2010,both are quick 5 min fixes. i support as i my self have hit the cancel order button a couple times :p.
5/25/2010,1
5/25/2010,supported anyway - but especially after the op changed.
5/25/2010,"a big part of the frustration comes from the lack of communication. for example, solving my pet problem (so far as i know) would be simply changing some numbers in the db in twenty minutes. am i wrong, and would it actually involve days of dedicated work? i don't know this, so i see a simple change and an unaccountable silence. for the best example of this, see the supercarrier back-and-forth from last december. why were the player-tested changes ditched and replaced with ones based on obviously faulty assumptions? nobody knows. in the absence of information, you get frustration and hysteria."
5/25/2010,"i don't see how fixing asault frigates, balancing rockets, boosting hybrids (which you have taken a personal interest in), or boosting lowsec are pet peeves.fixing the changed dominion sov system affects tens of thousands, if not more. fixing faction war affects a huge playerbase and a major part of the game.these are not pet peevs laing, these are former expansions that have been abondoned for the next shiny toy."
5/25/2010,"in the grand scheme of things, i think it says a lot about ccp that so many ppl have so many pet peeves, and it ain't something positive. this game is one of the most bug infested pieces of software i've ever encountered. and that's just one 'pet peeve'...."
5/25/2010,"supported. since incarna has been pushed back to 2011, let the next expansion be a ""fix"" expansion.there is more than enough material that needs fixing to be actually usable to make for a huge expansion. we dont really need any more ships. we dont really need any more space (although i wouldn't say no if they decided to add a couple fo new npc sov 0.0 regions). there is enough for any new player to do for years and years.but let's see them just finish the projects they've started. cosmos. faction warfare. tech 3 ships. the corp management interface. assault frigates. and many, many more.edit: since ccp like biblical-sounding expansion names, i propose that this expansion be called redemption."
5/25/2010,"tyrannis - such as it is - is here. incarna has already been pushed back, well let me see now, is it 3 years? 4? there is a ""gap"" this winter in which a ""fix expansion"" could usefully be fitted."
5/25/2010,"some of you may have clicked this link to the patch notes and been surprised to find that half the page is devoted to fixes. when you read through the ""changes"" section, you will also notice that a lot of ""changes"" are what many might call ""fixes"" instead. i'm going to go out on a limb here and say ccp has put the majority of man hours in the previous patch and this upcoming one into fixing existing stuff. reading through the patch notes, the obvious problems haven't been addressed, but it looks like a lot of fairly major issues are being fixed (being able to create two alliances at the same time?). i am kind of sad that i can't bounce around the inside of stations anymore when undocking. it was mildly amusing."
5/25/2010,"every patch has a rack of fixes, but a lot of them are on the order of ""corrected spelling error in the description of dread guristas small smartbomb"" or some such.what we want is a patch that is focused on fixing bugs and finishing existing content. faction warfare and cosmos aren't that buggy, as such, they're just terribly incomplete. there is a vast amount of unrealised potential in the existing content that could be expressed before more unfinished ideas are jammed in.5 complete, coherent, and deep gameplay concepts are worth 50 of the other kind."
5/25/2010,hear hear!
5/25/2010,"indeed. i believe planetary interaction is supposed to be part of sov/faction warfare. so, in a way, you might be jumping the gun before the entirety of the solution has been put into place. the big issue is the lack of communication from ccp on the issues that keep being raised. occasionally, we hear ""that's a great idea"" (i.e. the dead horse) but a ""we hope to get to that in xyz patch"" is what people want to hear."
5/25/2010,"just so that people are clear on this. i want incarna. i believe that pi is necessary and useful for dust-514, which i also want.but i also want the updates, fixes and completion of existing content that we were already promised:dominion lag: 7 months5th subsystem for t3: a yearfaction warfare: two yearsstations in w-space: a yearassault frigates: god knows - longer than i've been playing.cosmos: again, longer than i've been playingmission fix: yet another longer than i have been playing. for the love of god, heal this bleeding wound in your gameplay ccp.the list goes on, but with what i have listed above there is more than enough for an absolutely epic expansion."
5/25/2010,"out of your patch note link:none are related to ship balancingnone are related to fixing the new sov warfare problemsnone are related to faction warnone of them fix cosmos agentsnone of them are an improvement on the ui designnone of those fix completely broken shipsnone relate to a missing subsystem of a shipthank you for quoting the patch notes that completely supports this thread. it's better than any ""thumbs up"" you can give."
5/25/2010,"that's pretty narrow view of the game, really. complaining about a virtually unused and unknown feature (cosmos) that won't actually help 99.5% of the people that play the game? i'd rather have things like fleet lag fixed tbqfh. -liang"
5/25/2010,narrow is avoiding 95% of what you quoted. cosmos are underused because they are unfinished.
5/25/2010,"when did ccp say they'd introduce stations in w-space? the official line was along the lines of, ""you only have what you take in with you - no sov, no moon mining."""
5/25/2010,"from the comments i have seen destroyers seem to be an unbalanced class. the thrasher itself seems to be perfect, yet the coercer, cormorant and catalyst all come up short when compared to it. so i have decided to undertake a balance attempt, please bear in mind that this is my first foray into eve online balancing.the main problems i see is - excessively high signature radius (same as a scimitar in some cases)- very low damage compared to size.- in many cases the ships destroyers are made to hunt are actually the hunters, i wish to level the playing field.overall i wish to make the destroyers fill one role, high alpha, fast moving destroyers.revised ship bonuses:blanket changes-optimal range bonus changed to damage bonus (20%)-reduction of rate of fire decrease (from 25% to 20%)---coercer -"
5/25/2010,---thrasher -
5/25/2010,+10% cargo capacity per level+5% range of tractor beams per level+1% effectiveness of salvagers per levelthis is all destroyers need.
5/25/2010,the changes are too drastic and are not warranted.not supported.
5/25/2010,i added a new item to the list
5/25/2010,/signed
5/25/2010,it used to only have the logos in the game. it is amusing that the admin for dotlan is able to handle adding logos...
5/25/2010,lets get this in game ccpprimary. represent!
5/25/2010,"as our alliance logo is pwn, it would be nice to get it in-game sometime soon."
5/25/2010,make it so.
5/25/2010,"it is deliscious, it is needed as a commodity a week last tuesday."
5/25/2010,is bad thread imo
5/25/2010,this is an awesome idea.
5/25/2010,bacon is that way ->
5/25/2010,flying bacon sammiches :)
5/25/2010,"first of all thanks for reading my post...now that the pleasantries are out of the way.....lets begin. why is it that this game allows gangs of people to camp on gates and destroy unknowing ships. i don't mind pvp combat and i understand the game is built on it, but it's a real drag whenever you warp into a sector and there are four ships waiting to tackle, scram, and flat out obliterate you. i think that the makers of this game should install platform guns at all gates leading into and out of a security sectors. not all sectors of course but the ones in 0.4 to 0.1, in 0.0 space its supposed to be ""outlaw"" space so no guns are needed. even if you don't want to put guns at these locations at least prevent hostilities at these points...it almost made me quit the game the first time i lost a myrmidon battlecruiser due to a group of gate camping thugs. in closing if you want more players to quit then keep on letting guys camp gates and see how many would be paying customers you will continue to lose...elitestealth"
5/25/2010,first in a troll thread!
5/25/2010,all i can think is not very elite or stealthy if you struggle to sneek past 4 people on a gate
5/25/2010,"i'm ambivalent on the proposal itself. i'm more inclined to think that low security space should be made more profitable, but not less dangerous.in the meantime, however, for low security travel, i recommend flying either a fast-aligning frigate, a ship capable of fitting a ""covert ops cloaking device ii"", or forming a fleet with a friend you trust who goes through the gate first and tells you what's on the other side (commonly called a ""scout""). your friend should be flying a fast-aligning frigate or a ship that's fit with a ""covert ops cloaking device ii""."
5/25/2010,"it work both ways.if gate camping will be impossible abt same qtty of pilots leave. (i am not saying i like them, but...)btw myrmydone can tank a lot of damage if fitted right, if you have some friends following you it may work other way around for gate campers. if you want to move around lowsec solo - use interceptor, covertops, recon, transport & alike..."
5/25/2010,im gonna have to disagree with you on this one. i personally love the fact that there is no safe place in eve. btw there are guns on gates from 1.0 to 0.1
5/25/2010,"why arent such things like countermeasure probes or jamming systems available that would block a probes ability to track a ship, seems logical that with all the stealth systems such tech should be applicable, if they can tracks us we should be ablke to jam their tracking signals or hide release probes of our own that could hide our location from probers.seems only logical that if you can scramble someones warp, and web their thrusters, dampen their range, jam cyno's that the ability to learn counter probing skills should be just as readily available."
5/25/2010,didnt you start the same thread in features& ideas aswell?and the answer is cloak
5/25/2010,cloaking devices do this job quite handily and are widely and readily available.
5/25/2010,"yes because i had a gm specifically tell me to try suggesting it in the two areas, now when you have a less robotic and a more intelligible and reasonable response, id love to hear it, until than, that answer is not an answer but the response of someone who knows nothing but how to hide from an enemy."
5/25/2010,"the cloaking device is the counter to probes. you cloak, they cant find you anymore.there is also the option of unprobable ships with eccm. but for the general rule cloak does the job fine. please enlighten me how cloaking is not hiding from the enemy?"
5/25/2010,confirming that cloaking devices (of any kind) are the ideal countermeasure to probes.
5/25/2010,"the counter-probing skill already exists. ""cloaking""... hell, it even has a low pre-requisite (electronics iv)."
5/25/2010,"already exists, check out eccm effects and probing; and stuff about non probable t3's (you can also even cloak carriers and use them without probes getting you.)not supported as you didn't bother looking into what other jamming systems are already available on the market"
5/25/2010,"low sec compared to 0.0 / empire is unequal and seriously needs a buff.i think losing sec standing is a bad thing, if pirate syndicates exist then surely there must be ways to bribe concord, i say pirates should be allowed to pay of the sec loss at least upto -2.00"
5/25/2010,there is already a way to up your sec status and -1.99 doesn't prevent you access to any high sec systems.
5/25/2010,"yeah but i didnt want it so you could pay to have it 0, at least at -2 you will have 'issues' after a kill.we could have it so certain low sec agents do this"
5/25/2010,not supported. you either embrace the -10 or you will have to work yourself up again. buying out would be too easy.
5/25/2010,1. gank freighter2. loot3. pay off concord4. win5. do it againdo you not see how horrible this idea is?
5/25/2010,"thats exactly what i want, low sec needs to be lethal costs and such go on how often you do this and bribery isnt an uncommon thing"
5/25/2010,"no.it's already easy enough to up your sec status. what's the point? are you a criminal or not? if you are, your security status should be low, you just shouldn't be penalized for it by not being able to enter high-sec. if you're not then you shouldn't have a low security status.this is not the answer because you've gotten the question wrong."
5/25/2010,"do you have any idea how unreasonable that really is? if you're down to turning off his hardeners from dual medium neuts, he's long long since blown up your hurricane and 2 or 3 more just like it. drakes are bad news bears. also, i'd like to see your barrage hurricane that doesn't do explosive damage? just because you ""can"" switch damage types doesn't necessarily mean you really can, or will.considering that the nightmare is one of the best ships to mission in... -liang"
5/25/2010,"you really have no clue what you're talking about. have you ever looked at any of the battle reports from the recent nc/sc war? in every bs battle, the apocalypse was the most used ship. why is that i wonder?here's an idea, why don't you cross train to fly the ships you want to fly instead of whining about the ones you don't? it really doesn't take that long if you already have your support skills trained up."
5/25/2010,"missions... i was talking about 0.0 pve -> ratting/plexing. blob warfare is something completely different than smallscale pvp...to get for example minmatar t2 guns + battleship iv, it takes another 3 months of training, bs v +1 month +shield tanking skills.anyways, let's end this. without any support from the community for a low-sp amarr pilot, i guess i've to either search for a low sp-friendly, non-russian speaking, actually pvp active alliance living in raiders/sansha/drone regions without a killboard full of failfittings, or wait another 5-6 months to fly a battleship of another race. let's see what happens faster.... i'm so tired of flying solo pvp. if anyone wants to know why i didn't join an empire/lowsec corp yet, it's simply because i don't want to corp hop./thread"
5/25/2010,"as someone who flies a nightmare, and has killed all npc types in one:laser are fine. seriously i have never had a problem against anything except those damn guristas elite cruisers. hell i used an apoc against serpentis and angels for like 6 months and never had problems.edit: fit mwds on your pvp ships.edit 2: and cap boosters."
5/25/2010,"disturbed lucy... get your support (capacitor skills in particular) and weapon (gunnery skills in particular) skills up and i can almost guarantee that you will not be having cap and/or dps issues with amarr ships.in terms of tactics though... well... that's a different story. amarr are, overall, not very solo ""oriented"" ships (the exceptions being the crusader, arbitrator, and both recon ships). they are ""gank and tank"" fleet ships with comparatively even armor resistances and decent range on their ""short range"" guns.one last thing... please post the fits of the ships you most commonly use. yes, this is a serious request. if my hunch is right, you're fitting them very, very wrong and it might explain many of the problems you are encountering with amarr ships."
5/25/2010,"yes, because 2 medium neuts are going to dry out a battleship's cap in time to matter. the hurricane is a fairly good bc, and it can beat a number of the others, but i'd be hard-pressed to think of any competent battleship fit it could beat reliably."
5/25/2010,"this fit is for solo lowsec, so no bubbles, and engagements aren't usually 1v1, more like 1vparty. i'd not bring this to a fleet !high5 hpl ii2 fmpl ii (mixing pulse lasers isn't that bad, because the fighting range is 1-24 km, to fit 7 hpl awu v is needed along with a +5% pg implant with my fit)midmids are flexible. because of the usual 1vparty engagements, i get scramed anyways by tackler frigs, so i don't use mwd (i'd have to downgrade lasers to do so). i don't use a cap booster, because i run from armormortanked canes, curses and pilgrims anyway (the tracking disrupter would be my nemesis alone even without their neuts) i never lost a fight with this ship due to capacitor problems yet.1-2 eccm (falcons, rooks and especially ecm drones are very common and this helps a lot! amarr t1 ships have the a low sensor strength and if you get jammed when flying solo, you are usually dead. i actually killed a rook in a 1v1 for example :> )scram and/or disruptweb(2nd web/ a tracking comp / ab instead of scram when using only 1 eccm) - switching mids situationallow1600 rolled tungsten1x eanm iidcu ii3x hs ii drones5x vespa ec-600 or 5x hornet+5x warrior ii - ships using ""standard"" loadouts are not fitted against ecm, giving me a huge advantage and them a huge surprise :>i had great success with this even while not being max skilled. i run from basically every non-harbinger battlecruiser except shield canes, which run from me :d. some bc's may be killable (myrmidon, brutix, cyclone(?)) with maxed skills but i'm ~2 months away from that damagewise (awu v, surgical strike v, bcs v) and even more far away from perfect navigation and passive tanking skills). to see this in action, i want to show you the youtube channel of the pilot swatyy, who switched to a cane + logistic alt by now (for obvious reasons). but his solo harbinger pvp movies are still up."
5/25/2010,"this is your real problem. low sp.train to the same skill level in one of the other races you mentioned and you will see that you will not fare not better (beside using a drake in missions, the ultimate mission low sp ship)."
5/25/2010,i alread know the damage output of an all skills v abaddon due to lancer implants in my mission clone.
5/25/2010,"ok so not only do lasers have awesome damage, use little/no ammo(crystals) , can swap crystals instantly, have awesome tracking and range.... now you want to be able to pick damage types also?you may say - caldari can swap damage type with missiles. this is true. however think about it... the vast majority of caldari missile boats have a bonus to kinetic damage only, a decent skilled pilot would get 25% extra damage to kinetic. this in itsself negates the use of changing damage type in most situations. (most not all) also doing so takes atleast 10 seconds, probably more taking into account ping times/lag.lasers are fine for pve from what everyone says (apart from yourself)and they sure as hell are one of the best weapons for a pvp, hell look at any bs fleet big or small, people want amarr lasers, weather its short range gank, mid range or sniper range.definatly not supported! considering us caldari have wanted changes to lolkets (rockets) for such a long time and nothing has changed."
5/25/2010,"no, it can't. a armor tanked hurricane dies quite easily to a properly fitted shield tanked hurricane (i do it fairly often, and i fly both and i prefer shieldcane most of the time, bear in mind i have both hg slave and lg snake and i spend 99% of my time in the cheaper snake clone), to nano drake, if he doesn't have slaves to ham drake, etc, as well as a host of things the shield hurricane just kills. on other hand, shield hurricane has to avoid anything with lasers fitted. you can only kill a really bad bs pilot with pve fit or fail fit with either.if i had laser skills i'd probably fly the hpl nano myrmidon occasionally as well, because it's imo the best myrmidon fit and quite a nasty ship with both good dps, good speed, good agility, solid buffer, cap booster,versatility because of dronebay, and, well, everything really.those mwd-less plated bricks work on paper for warp to covops alt, fight, if they bring too many people die, die, rinse repeat, or for hugging station and deaggro/dock games. they're not as such generic pvp fits worth a damn, and when you fight competent pilots they make you sad.well, yes, you have somewhat of a point about pve but ships are not really balanced around pve. well, ok, but mainly used weapons on gallente are hybrids, the only drone bonused bs is the dominix. myrmidon, yes, ok, but myrmindon is not a focused droneboat because of 75m3 bandwidth and 6 turrets."
5/25/2010,"it is not solo pvp when you bring an alt in a rr bs. and even then his pvp videos are a bad example how to fly the harb.maybe look at the videos of prozacxx (nano harb), atrophocy, kil2 how to use the harbinger solo. atrophocy's last video had a nice solo kill of a drake with a harbinger."
5/25/2010,not supported
5/25/2010,"ok folks, i've to admiti was wrong!the problem i had in pve with angels especially, was so simple i actually don't want to post it, it's so... awkward. but nevertheless, here we go: i used an abaddon for ae4, because i thought, it has good tank and good damage. it works fine for raiders etc, but the problem why it took me 2 hours (no blitz) in ae 4 was because i ran out of capacitor with 4 hardeners, 4 cap rechargers + 3x ccc and no cap = no tank, so i often had to wait for my capacitor to fill up. now i used an apoc, with only 3 cap recharger + 2 ccc rigs but i had more than enough cap all the time and no problems at all and was even able to fit an aux nano pump and a tracking comp, finished the mission in 54 minutes (cleared absolutely everything except bonus pocket). well, the highest bounty battleship was an 800k one and it takes ages to kill it, but i guess i can't have everything ;)i'm sorry for everyone who raged reading this thread! i hope you can forgive me ;)regards- dl/thread"
5/25/2010,you can also do the bonus pocket solo with good skills.mega pulse apocs are a damn fine mission boat.note: maybe fit a web instead of the tracking computer for angel missions.
5/25/2010,i admit i haven't entirely thought through this system. it's a bit complicated and i don't have time. but i supported becasue i do strongly agree that with so many candidates there should be some way we can voice our opinion that you are revolted by a particular candidate. otherwise its just the most divisive candidates that get elected not the most representative. i want people who actually represent the voters not people who are obnoxious crackpots.
5/25/2010,i think i speak for the majority when i suggest that furthur expansion be delayed until the current server is opperating smoothly. many known glitches exist and the server has trouble enen doing normal restarts. good luck out there!
5/25/2010,i think you think wrong.
5/25/2010,"i like the idea of having to choose between joining an alliance or faction warfare, so i dunno about 3.however 4/5 sound fair and nice, maybe we can have certain planet structures that can only built in faction places.for example, gallente space - storage size increased on everything. amarr - faster couriering / routing, caldari - cheaper structure construction and minmatar - a reduction in power / cpu needssomething on the lines of that, as for 0.0 give them all of these facilities free based on what type of command centre they have, i know theres no racial type just planet difference but lets make it different :d"
5/25/2010,having the option for an automatic bill or a tax would save a lot of boring out-of-game paperwork needing to be kept by alliance heads.
5/25/2010,almost every lvl5 can be done with a drake and basi.moar alts is moar.if the missions were not predictable and way way harder so it actually took a group of say 5-8 people then maybe. as that wont happen. nein
5/25/2010,"make the scan time really long then like 1 minute per cycle instead of 10 seconds so you can scan down the cloakers, it just takes time, ensuring that if their afk they will get killed and if they're hunting with half a brain they'll be moving around looking for targets ensuring that the 1 minute scan time wont hurt them."
5/25/2010,"so, it takes 1 whole minute to scan down a cloaky ship, then you need to warp to that location (however far away it might be). an afk cloaker with half a brain will be moving out towards empty space at about 300m/s (covops frig anyway). even at 200m/s, that's 60x200 = 12km in the time it takes to scan them down. bump range is 2km, so you warp to the point you've scanned and 12km in some direction is a cloaked ship.... woo.even if the location you scan down is where they are at the end of the scanning, if aligning then warping takes anymore than 10 seconds (warping usually takes around 20 seconds, helps with session change issues), they're outside bump range then too.either way i don't see scanning cloaked ships working as it is easily defeated by the cloaked ship (at least covops cloak anyway)."
5/25/2010,"when you warp to them, they are burning off from where you are at that moment, you bookmark that spot then wait a bit untill their about 150 away from you you scan them adn align in that direction and burn you mwd and you will catch and bump them"
5/25/2010,"predictable response #1. here's some math for you. i'll ignore stacking penalties for the sake of convenience.i have two sensor boosters that give me a 50% bonus to targeting range each. i activate both of these, so my optimal range is 100% +50% (150%) + 50% = 225%. now i have two serpentis sensor-dampen me reducing my optimal range (and scan resolution) by 50% apiece. my optimal range goes from 225% to 112.5% with the first, and 56.25% with the second, so i'm still only locking at a little over half my base lock distance, and my scan resolution is down to 25% of its original since i can't boost both at once but they can dampen both. now consider that in some missions you can get damped/td'd by 5-6 ships. the situation is even worse with tracking computers/disruptors, as a scripted t2 tracking computer gives about a 15% bonus to optimal range but a single tracking disruptor takes off about 45%! ecm might be the worst, though, as npc ecm has a flat percentage chance of working that is not affected by a ship's sensor strength at all - a raven with 3 remote eccms on it is jammed just as frequently as a golem with no eccm despite having dozens of times the sensor strength."
5/25/2010,"predictable response #2.as i explained in the post right above this one, you really can't counter npc electronic warfare, because there's simply too much of it. i don't necessarily want to make the missions easier, but i do want to make them less frustrating - having to sit and wait for the rare break in a 7 sansha cycle-disruption, as in level 4 blockade, does not make the mission difficult. it just makes it annoying for everyone not flying a raven or a dominix. and while bringing friends does certainly work, if i really wanted to sit there doing nothing while other people made money for me i'd still be mining. :p"
5/25/2010,"in australian elections there is a cost for nomination, plus you need a number of signatures before you can nominate. this fee is refunded if you get more than 3% of the vote.i would support an isk cost for running."
5/25/2010,"(this will only make sense to dutch players)to be fair, isn't the pvv simply 'wilders inc.'? if we would go to a point where you need 5000-6000 votes to be on the csm, i think it would be quite likely to see some more parties form."
5/25/2010,not everyone who has isk is a worthy candidate just as not everybody without isk is a bad candidate.if there was an isk cost it would have to be significant to have any impact (many billions) and the result would be that people such as myself wouldn't be able to take part...
5/25/2010,"unfortuantely, as you said, there isn't really any other way to present that kind of information on so many candidates. it's not feasible to do them all on one page due to massively's page styles and the fact that people will only scroll down so much. so i listed the three pages in order of who i had the most information on, and that meant putting previous csm members on the first page. if it helps put your mind at rest, we had an abnormally high rate of hit conversion from page 1 to page 2. about 90% of the people that visited page 1 went on to page 2, but few people went to page 3. so everyone but the relatively unknown players got a very similar level of coverage. it was unusual because we usually lose as many people going from page 1 to 2 of a three-page article as going from 2 to 3. people really must have wanted to see all the candidates worth voting for."
5/25/2010,wow thats an incredible increase of voter turn out but the fact that only 12.67% where involved is still a bit disheartening. t_t i can't wate to see the results tomorrow.
5/25/2010,"yeah but he isn't a party in the classical sense and should be taken as serious as ankh, too.."
5/25/2010,i voted abstain all all 4 of my accounts as i have done every time.the csm is full of powerblocks making sure they have there rep(s) in hell the nc even sent mails out to coordinate who was to vote for who.much like in rl it doesnt matter who you vote for the crap still get in
5/25/2010,"if your reason for not voting is that the csm is full of powerbloc representative, wouldn't the logical course of action be to vote for a candidate that is not in a powerbloc?self-fulfilling prophecy and all that..."

5/25/2010,"i too am in an npc corp, but i didn't vote for ankh, have corp tickers showing and i'm not a take care alt. this makes me special in this thread."
5/25/2010,"there's so much fail i'm having a hard time deciding where to begin with.""this is, why ankh is needed"" what, to stop people from killing people in eve? to make all of our spaceships become cute, furry, delectable forest animals?""dull, jealous griefers"" i live in 0.0 and kill people, thank you very much. i don't know what dictionary you're using to define ""griefing"" but i'm assuming it's the one that says any form of killing another player is verboten in eve. also, i will fully admit to griefing hulks during hulkageddon ii and killing a csm candidate's pod the other day (note the semantic difference).""the majority of paying subscribers are non pvp players and don't like your attitude""i'll let that statement speak for itself.""i will make sure, of you noobs gank her, you will get ganked over and over by me. and believe me: you will not like it being ganked in a fleet battle or a gate camp by a blue player.""shivani's salvager i strikes my tempest perfectly, dealing for 1 armor plate and 2 tangled power conduits.also, i'm pretty sure i'm not set blue to any tards like you, so expect to feel a sharp and fatal pain upon jumping into my alliance's territory.also, you do not gank people in fleet battles.also, you don't gatecamp blues.also, you don't know who my main is, and to keep myself from having to deal with crap-faced evemails sent by the likes of you, nobody will ever know who captain foivos really is.""respect the industrialist and carebears."" i respect chribba and a few others. namely, the people i build capships with and pew-pew-lazor with. respect is not given. it is earned.in closing:your attitude is childish and disgusting, discrediting yourself."
5/25/2010,i was going to bake bitter cookies but i see you've monopolized the vital ingredient.
5/25/2010,"oh, i am going to post with my main(s) (plural!), if the others will do too.first off, my dear soon-to-be victim, i have undertaken far more extreme measures than ganking some blue or ganking someone, who was in the same gatecamp like me. that's why mercenaries have various mains. and a payment of 3 billion is worth the effort to invest some time to sneak into the alliances and corps. ya, carebears got that many isk....second: you are only a cheap coward on an internetboard.:post with your main, but i figure, you have not the balls."
5/25/2010,"""the majority of paying subscribers are non pvp players and don't like your attitude""broken down:the majority - more than half of ""paying subscribers"" - the implication being that players who do not spend money are lesser players / or that spending money gives you a greater influence and a more important opinion. or that the people with an opposite opinion to yours are not paying for their accounts, and therefore do not have an important opinion. any opininion opposing yours would be a free opinion and therefore an unimportant one.are non-pvp players - interesting; would this be an assertion that more than half of the subscribing players do not even pvp once? or to be more fair, on a regular basis? and would this include industrial characters who carry out mining and industrial / research work for pvp groups?and don't like your attitude - so of the ""enormous"" group of players who pay money to ccp, you know that they do not pvp, and that they are united in their approval and disapproval of certain posters? this is extraordinary and a triumph of statistical analysis."
5/25/2010,"indeed, id say rediculously so! i call shenanigans!"
5/25/2010,"oh hi natana, how are you doing? still bitter about being banned from eve-ger?"
5/25/2010,i think you should have enough 'bitter' yourself to bake your cookies nao!
5/25/2010,i think you should go wash your vagina!
5/25/2010,do you think you just made the number of people who want to gank her less or more?

5/26/2010,"well, if statements aren't nearly as efficient as people might thing when it comes down to cpu cycles. it might just be that putting it all in one formula actually performs faster than checking to se if it is a hit. but as you said - it is not as if it is going to happen anyway."
5/26/2010,support! especially the nighthawk part! give us one single gridslot more for gods sake please!
5/26/2010,"a brutix doesn't get 1100 dps without officer gear. a brutix with max skills, 7x neutrons, 3 damage mods, and hammerhead iis gets 860 dps. the same fit on an astarte gets 1035, for comparison. for a harby to get more ehp than that astarte, it needs to fit a 1600, 2 eanm, a damage control, and three trimarks, and even then it only hits 76k. the fit is reasonable, but it does a third less dps and moves slower even at max skills. i'd still take the astarte in a second(ignoring cost). yeah, it's not the same as a triple-plate geddon, but it has as much ehp as most sniper-fit battleships. any bc that can tank three races of(old) doomsday isn't doing too badly on tank. also, no repair bonus is tempting on anything too small to use battleship reppers, unless you're running l3 missions."
5/26/2010,"in addition to the op, how would you feel about either 25 more drone bay or an extra turret on the absolution without power grid change. because atm with the additional zealot turret added and the much more useful range and speed of the zealot, plus the other battleships and bc options, there's still so many alternatives to the absolution that nobody will ever fly one."
5/26/2010,"although i am losing faith in this section of the forums, i support this matter."
5/26/2010,"supporting this! astarte, absolution and nighthawk really need to have a role besides being expensive and sometimes worse than tier 2 bcs."
5/26/2010,"learning skills were a design flaw imo. at least the extended learning skills package. having said that, i don't see how you can reverse it in a way that is 'fair' for everybody.basicly, i don't care that much and as such i will not support this topic."
5/26/2010,exactly!
5/26/2010,"qft. learning skills are fundamental to the eve game mechanics. you need them in the long term. if you fail to realize that, you fail at eve."
5/26/2010,"learning skills are a long term vs. short term investment. by removing that decision, you are hurting not only the old people who trained them(by wasting their time), you are hurting new players by removing what can be an incredibly deep planning moment in their character's life. not supported, you don't want them, and the bonuses provided, you are not in any way obligated to train them."
5/26/2010,"yes.learning skills are in my opinion unnecessary, and a deterrent to many people who want to try eve for just a few weeks. ccp themselves have admitted that their introduction was a mistake, and it's never too late to clean up on them."
5/26/2010,"this. learning skills annoy people, but they're not a problem."
5/26/2010,rofl
5/26/2010,"i would like to contest that. i've introduced several people to eve, and every single one of them came back to me within the first few days asking 'what do i do with these learning skills?'. i don't know howmuch of a deterrent it is to new players, although i can imagine it is, but in the least, it causes confusion."
5/26/2010,"confusion? sure. many things about eve confuse new players. i know a great many things about eve confused me at first and took a long time for me to wrap my brain around. that's not a bad thing. that confusion is a lot of what kept me interested. most long-term players i know relished the ""figuring things out"" process that comes with learning eve. i'd say those players, who become long-term, are eve's target market.. not the easily discouraged because things are confusing."
5/26/2010,not that kind of confusing..more the kind of 'i know what they do..but whyyy?..'
5/26/2010,"i have a friend we can call ""a"". i introduced a to eve. a enjoyed it for a few weeks, but became rather frustrated with several parts of the game, ultimately leading to her moving on to a different game. these were her complaints: you mean i have to spend more than a month just to be able to train skills as fast as everyone else? why are there all these extra modules for almost the same price which are a lot worse than the modules people use? (talking about named stuff) this tutorial is really long and boring. why do i have to learn about mining? why can't i click on something to attack it? these quests are mind-numbingly boring.a ended up ditching eve for hellgate london (which died). came back to eve briefly and reiterated how much repetitive action there was, how much time was spent waiting, and how boring missions were, before leaving for tabula rasa (which died). couldn't convince a to try eve again after that. considering how games she play end up dying, perhaps that's for the best. however, she still made valid points that are likely echoed by other people who try eve then quit. there is a certain demand for some linear content to get people into the game that eve lacks (or lacked, it has been a while since i last ran the tutorial). ditching the learning skills would allow people to start working on their gameplay-related training right away without any detours."
5/26/2010,"every time i've introduced someone to eve, i've explained it to them and given them the advice to spend maybe half their time on learning skills and half on real skills. never heard any complaints."
5/26/2010,"same here. i just tell em that 4+3 is fine, anything after that is a commitment for the really long term, and to make that decision when they make that commitment. one didn't bother with the advanced skills at all until he'd been playing for over a year, another trained up 5+5 before he even started playing (messy divorce at 6 months of his life), the rest ended up in the 4+4 to 5+5 range.seriously the whole ""lrning skilz are evil"" thing is just people crying to be protected from their own weakness in being unable to restrain themselves from min-maxing. they can't stand the idea that someone, somewhere might be getting a whole 66 sp/hr more than them, but they dont want to put in the time to get that last couple of percent."
5/26/2010,"what depth? defer do-fun-stuff skills at the start of your career so as not to cripple yourself later? wow, such freedom of choice. good to see the e-wang ""eve is not supposed to be accessible to those foul noobs, it's a game for real men!"" brigade out in force."
5/26/2010,"i was one of those ""foul noobs"" and i enjoyed the choice. i actually didn't finish up my learning skills until well after 2 years into the game. cripple yourself? nonsense. a level 5 skill is a level 5 skill no matter how long it takes to train it."
5/26/2010,"your attitude is terrible, and you're absolutely wrong. i find it amusing that you refuse to look beyond your own prejudice of (seemingly) ""lol they week min maxer lol"" to ""wow, we make people sit around for like 2 weeks doing nothing fun in the game"". it doesn't even make any sense, because if they eliminated learning skills most of the people in this thread wouldn't even be affected. we would all be exactly as we are because we already paid the piper. learning skills add nothing to the game. i've introduced several friends to the game and they have almost all quit in the time when they're supposed to be doing learning skills. and yes, i told them to train up some skills to do something in the game first. i mean god forbid that i have an interest in making eve not suck for new players.i mean seriously, how do you justify me as an older player having an ever widening gap in capabilities because i trained learning skills? in order to even slow that gap they've got to spend damn near a month training learning skills. a month that they could have devoted to getting some skills under their feet so that i don't solo their myrm in a vigil or something.-liang"
5/26/2010,"the people who would be most hurt are this are the new players(for example myself). i am at roughly 5mil sp now in 3 months, and if i lost my learning skills suddenly i would be set way back on both my accounts, having wasted 21 days approx on two accounts(+my extra remap on the second one for training learning skills). so unless a system of bonus is put in, your only hurting the people who joined in the past 6 months(post dominion) who have already put in the time to train them and would now train slower and have wasted 3+weeks on learning skills.just my 2cents, supported as per op.removing with no bonus not supported."
5/26/2010,"argh my browser sucks for quoting! or maybe i suck. . .anyway thanks for the response, so in return i'll try to return the favor here.i was thinking about your ideas, and i think you're on the right track. how about something like a new mission base for characters of nefarious interests? such as missions for particular individuals living out of these stations (i would prefer the station managers themselves), with huge cash bounties and special single station bonuses as opposed to lps and security increases. maybe even give them a negative security status requirement, so as to ""prove"" to said boss that you aren't a concord spy or whatnot. and although i do see where you're going with mob bosses i have to still disagree, mob bosses usually don't stabilize the regions, ie mexico is not stable. although that is a little what i think low-sec should be like. we need to give the playerbase a legitimate reason why its there. where is lowsec not high sec? (please bear in mind we're talking immersion and rp here, not mechanics). i think giving low-sec more of a story to it will actually get more players involved. anyway keep it up, the more you hash this out with your critics the better your ideas get."
5/26/2010,"here's another brainstorming idea. it would be sweet if there were hidden stations in the middle of distant asteroid fields or somesuch that had to be scanned out. they'd be pirate stations, and you could only dock in them if you had low security status (to keep out concord, of course). that's where you'd find pirate agents, and they'd give missions, to attract the isk lovers. lp rewards could be enhanced booster blueprints, smuggling ships, maybe a skillbook that makes wardeccing cheaper, so on and so forth."
5/26/2010,"somewhere in the depths of this thread is that very possibility, pirate stations that have to be probed down to find, there you would find the pirate mission agents and the black market pannel.lowsec pirate missions might send you into hisec with a timer that allows a certain objective to be attained without concord getting you or somesuch mission, but as a control, any deviation from the mission track gets concords attention, so you couldnt warp to a station etc if your sec is too low.i will adjust the main post to rflect this possibility."
5/26/2010,"i'm simply astonished someone thought that the removal of custom folders was a good idea.what possible benefit does the removal of custom folders have?please explain how we are to track the activity and movements of a player with several characters in different alliances and/or corporations effectively without custom folders?how are we to, at a glance, ascertain whether a particular group of players is active? do you expect people to trawl through largely unsorted collections of hundreds of contacts?this is going to hit mercenaries and wardec corporations hard, adds nothing to the game, only subtracts and complicates what is a vital intelligence tool that was available to players.edit:people are now telling me in npc corp chat that they have just reset all standings, they find the new system so useless they are having to set only a single corp/alliance red at once."
5/26/2010,"yeah, this was incredibly stupid."
5/26/2010,"trying to make noise about this before tyrannis resulted in tears from the fanboiz.the csm cannot, and will not be able to help.ccp knew long before deployment this was wilful destruction, and they got ccp prismx to just troll us instead of listening.the contact list appears to be a tool for 0.0 space only now, and i doubt it's even any good for that."
5/26/2010,"why the **** did you remove vital functionality from your ui? seriously, what the **** were you thinking?"
5/26/2010,"this is even worse than i expected.just logged in, all the individuals i set red are in one huge amorphous mass rather than in ordered custom folders denoting corp and known associations.the new system is counter intuitive and not nearly as informative as the old.do.not.likereally. think of a few choice curse words, i dont think highly of you tonight ccp. this was not needed, this has not improved the game."
5/26/2010,"thank you. i had all my contacts sorted into ""corp"" folders. needless to say the number has grown quite abit over the time.i can't believe it - still desperately hoping for a secret ""enable folder-view"" button i just haven't found yet"
5/26/2010,add -10 through 10 standings and im 100% suport
5/26/2010,"confirming that this lack of folders sucks hard. what were you thinking, ccp? please give us the old contact list, or at least folders again."
5/26/2010,finally my lack of friends has an up-side.
5/26/2010,"yup. that and the ability to increase the per-page display count in evegate.even with olders, it's not that uncommon to have 30-40 chars in the same group (e.g. one set of war targets), but to then have to page through these 10 at a time is just gah! have fun trying to mass-remove people from your list once they're not longer necessary to have in your contact list: ""select all, delete, yes select all, delete, yes seleffs just let me nuke everyone at once!!""this is made even worse since there's no way to sort these people into folders.yay! i have three different groups of wts and four alt corps to keep track of, and now we're no longer at war with two of those sure, i can filter some stuff out, but it's still a matter of doing it 10 at a time, figuring out for each page whether they should go or not, and not being able to mass-zap people who are no longer relevant to keep track of."
5/26/2010,fix it plz
5/26/2010,i agree 100% with op.give us arbitrary contact grouping back!
5/26/2010,i used to monitor people buying and selling things via contracts by keep them as contacts. it was so nice and tidy. now they're all just... in my contacts list...boo.
5/26/2010,"useless, broken and unworkablecurrent ""implementation"" is garbage"
5/26/2010,i just manually deleted all standings on this character. i'm not dealing with this mess. thankfully i dont need standings to stationtrade. i have a notebook and a pencil to hand that i use for generating ballpark figures for potential profit etc...guess i am now using that to keep track of potential competitors. gg ccp.
5/26/2010,"it doesn't affect me much, but i find its lack disturbing. also, i recognize the usability of that feature. so, i agree with op 100%.however, i really like that expansion! pi just rocks."
5/26/2010,totally retarded. thanks ccp.
5/26/2010,"contact in address book before patch: 400+ (past and future targets, neatly ordered in per corp folders). lets get real, the address book was always used to keep a watch on enemies never to track friends, by 90% of the eve population.contact in address book now : 0 (no bug here, i deleted them myself as contacts without ordering attached are completely useless).congrats ccp, you've outdone yourself here. i guess in your rl address book the cutie you met in that club while drunk is next to the headhunter that wanted you for a nice job. i hope you won't make any mistake, this could get seriously wrong seriously quick here.edited to support, those wonderful forums preview function unchecked it...."
5/26/2010,i m game with this one.. sounds good
5/26/2010,"this sounds good at first glance, but people don't need another reason to go after pve fit ratters and miners in 0.0, they are already significant targets and people get enough just out of the kms. what stops them going after them is the liklihood of getting ganked themselves and the lack of targets due to good intelligence being passed to the ratters and carebears.you need to think through the proposal properly and consider the true problem and how people might twist the mechanic. i've been in 0.0 for a couple of months now and i've found one of the more irritating things to happen is where reds come into your system, cloak up and go /afk. it makes it difficult to rat or mine, you don't know what they are in or what backup they have. it ties down a lot of players with a boring game experience trying to fruitlessly hunt them down or just being there on standby, or you take a chance and risk it with inadequate backup after waiting ages for them to leave. why do people do this at the moment, just to spoil peoples game i think, now you want to give people a reason to employ this routinely as it surely would be.ultimately, this won't improve small gang warfare, it will just harm 0.0 ratting and mining. improving small gang warfare, requires improving the safety of small gangs in enemy space by for example increasing the number of gates per system and the number of routes that small gangs can take in and out. or encouraging the splitting up of large blobs, by requiring multiple objectives to be siezed and held in surrounding systems.i would have suggested adding something to just dissuade people from massive blobbing, but ccp tried adding massive lag and yet people still don't get it."
5/26/2010,100% agree.
5/26/2010,would be a great additionnow if only my modules would stop cycling.......
5/26/2010,i suggest that the ability to hotkey more common commands examples include but not limited to:sell itemdisplay market valuefit to current shipunfit modopen containerthis seems to me a simple change that could be done very easily.
5/26/2010,"yes please, would love keys for:-> view market details for next order (would work through the list of buy/sell orders in your wallet)-> modify selected orderthe only reason i don't trade more often is because of the shoddy ui, some hotkeys would be a nice start for improving it."
5/26/2010,i'm all for anything that makes us less dependant on the mouse while playing.
5/26/2010,hotkeys are good.
5/26/2010,"well it was some time ago...it may be more simplier nowand it cost nothing to say them we really want it.that's a new market using existing things, so it's a good idea."
5/26/2010,"i agree with this sentiment. we can at least ask. it's been, by my count, 2 years since csm 1. and while i doubt the code has gotten simpler, it does tie into the ""put more of the market into player hands"" manifesto."
5/26/2010,yes very very good idea
5/26/2010,do want!
5/26/2010,the ui as a whole needs work but this one definately is one of the most frustrating parts of it.
5/26/2010,100% supported.
5/26/2010,supported.
5/26/2010,"brilliant idea, please make this happen"
5/26/2010,good idea
5/26/2010,nothing i saw in tyranis patch notes suggest they are going to be removed/fixed.instead ccp write crap like that :
5/26/2010,"fix factional warfarewith 14 fw-related issues raised by the csm in the past, and almost all of these issues still being relevant, it is time to discuss the future of factional warfare and propose a realistic approach to improve the future of this aspect of the game.why is factional warfare worthy of devtime?factional warfare acts as a bridge between playstyles, and fulfills a niche pvp role within the game. individual players can easily contribute and participating does not require a large investment in ships. due to this low barrier to entry, it provides a casual way for new players and carebears alike to get introduced to pvp and lose their fear of low security space.factional warfare is not just beneficial for individual players, it is a great platform for corporations as well. soloplayers engaging in fw will quickly find and join fw-related corporations. corporations that tire of their playstyle often find the casual pvp of fw a nice temporary activity before moving on to another area of the game.short term improvementsthese are relatively small issues in urgent need of improvement, which will dramatically increase fw playability and enjoyment. currently, fw is broken at the core. fixing these issues will provide a stable foundation to build on.* bug and exploit fixes (detailed list will be provided to ccp)* encouraging pvp in fw missions and complexes* balancing fw-related npcs in missions and complexes* fixing the complex spawn system to make complexes spawn at all times during the daymid term improvementsthese issues require some more commitment from ccp, and help retain player interest in fw over longer periods of time.* running fw-related live events (fix above issues first!)* adding ways for players to know when systems are being contested, letting players find and fight eachother* roleplaying-alliances joining fw?long term improvementsthese improvements require considerable devtime. some of these were originally on the table when fw was designed but never made it in-game. these improvements expand on the foundation fw has laid, and make fw appeal to more players and have more meaningful consequences in the game.* add more ways to contest space* add pvp-related missions* add consequences to system occupancy* tie more playstyles into the fw system* integrate pirate factions into fwyour input welcomeplease provide any issues i should add to the list, or any arguments you believe i could use to convince ccp to finally commit to improving fw."
5/26/2010,"good proposal. fw has certainly been out long enough to qualify for version 2.0i feel that fw is missing the ""meaningful"" part of pvp. sure you can take over a system (mainly with intys orbiting a beacon at 10km apparently) and you get what? enemies can still dock there, you don't get system upgrades or anything. i love fw, but most of the time you are hanging around a very few systems and the militias just try to gank each other. i would also love to see a pirate fw faction that only accepts -10.0 members, is at war with all the other militias (even themselves?) but gets cheaper pirate ships from the lp store."
5/26/2010,i will support this if adding pirate factions is a priority.
5/26/2010,"thanks ankh, /supported with all my chars at least emo tj has the decency to actually give ideas :pso really i am supporting a thread that wants ideas"
5/26/2010,"i don't have any experience in fw though i've always toyed around with the idea. my biggest concern to convince me to join is having enough roleplayers and the support of capital fleets in lowsec. being honest here, i'm training up for dreadnought and possibly carrier down the road and would obviously want a home, should i want to go into fw. what i don't want is to be in there and then not see other capitals and it just be one big blob against new players. it doesn't sound fun or fair for anyone..also, i'd like to see more ideas on perhaps introducing more roleplaying to fw. at the moment, i really enjoy the pirate militias idea. i recall seeing that mentioned in the 09 fanfest fw video. sounds good for a first step in roleplaying and also i could see some great warfare come out of that.what are your thoughts on using capitals in fw?ps. congratulations on the election!"
5/26/2010,i don't take part in the fw however i can see its importance to the game and storyline and im glad someone capable is representing this
5/26/2010,"just as a police officer cannot handle a case against him(or his relatives and close friends for that matter), a gm should never be tasked with handling a complaint against them. it may be described as unethical, but i think more accurately, it is a conflict of interest(well being of the game/player vs. his own self-interest)."
5/26/2010,i have little to no confidence in gm's or ccp (t20 scandal) from various encounters. and this certainly isn't helping.
5/26/2010,supportedplease take a look at the hardener as well. it can't be that the only advantage of faction stuff is to have lower cpu. why does i.e. have a t2 kinetic hardener the same effect as the faction one?
5/26/2010,"more valuable input. op changed again.please guys, traders need these changes, and the more you support, the more we get noticed.each of these changes require very little coding/testing. regards,ana"
5/26/2010,i hope this happens.
5/26/2010,"hi there, fellow capsuleers!i'd like to draw your attention to the problem of sentry aggro mechanics for remote repping in lowsec, especially where logistics are concerned.look at this example:let's say i am in a corp which is an fw member and organizes an rr bs gang. our gang contains at least one member with outlaw security status. we encounter a gang of wartargets and fight them at a gate. the hostiles primary the outlaw, so everybody starts repping him. although we are only fighting wartargets, everyone who activated an rr module gets a gcc and is shot by gate guns. ok, that mechanic may not make much sense, but 350 dps shouldn't be too bad for a bs gang, so except for some drones, not much will die from sentry fire. the situation becomes worse if we have, say, a bc gang supported by a single scimitar. in that case, the scimi will have a gcc in basically every fight, and it will be the only ship with a gcc, so the sentry guns will focus it, forcing it to warp off eventually, leaving the rest of the gang to its fate. if gang mates want to share sentry aggro, they will have to do stupid things like shooting the gate. this is not only absurd, but really really annoying for anyone who has ever tried to be a logistig pilot in a small gang of pirates. even if you're fighting people that you're allowed to shoot at, the logistic ship will get a gcc...so my proposal is:remote repping (or any other kind of remote support) outlaws should not cause a gcc on the repper. however, if he reps someone who has a gcc, he will still get one.please discuss!"
5/26/2010,"what you describe was the initial mechanic, they changed it for wrong reasons but will never admit so."
5/26/2010,"yes, most people are critically affected by:- a missing subsystem- cosmos agents- faction warfare (most people live in highsec)- the sov warfare problems (most people live in highsec)- broken ships that aren't used... and yet ship/weapon balance is still pretty damn good.so that leaves the ui design? yeah sure - redesign the ui... but in reality this is probably a big enough thing to be its own expansion.-liang"
5/26/2010,"so as long as few people use it, a feature does not have to be finished or polished? isn't that a very backwards way of determining the usefulness of a feature? or are you saying that even if cosmos or fw were to be complete it would not make an impact on the majority of players?balance is pretty good when it comes to the ships that are actually used. in a game that heavily rely on non consensual pvp, all ships should be ok to use and not as today, where a portion is broken beyond comparability."
5/26/2010,"i've got an even better idea than using the winter patch to finish unfinished content: stop all future expansions until the content in existing expansions is finished and major bugs fixed.to wit:fix lag (again).finish cosmos, faction warfare, dominion, tyrannis add the missing subsystem.rebalance rails, rockets, assault frigates, ewar frigs, and largely unused ships (bellicose, anyone?)fix station gamesfully implement epic mission arcsonce all this is done, expansions should focus on the following:making missions and pve actually enjoyable, if this is even possible.making lowsec worthwhile.completely redesign the ui. literally, burn down the existing structure and start over from scratch. the new one should be modular and moddable.redesign poses and make pi something more interesting than poses on planets.until these problems are fixed, we simply do not need any further new content, especially the kind of half-finished junk that ccp has been foisting on us for years.i have said before, and will say again: ccp runs the risk of being annihilated should another company with sounder design, development, and management methodology and a commitment to high quality decide to implement an eve-style pvp sandbox."
5/26/2010,"this is the main problem i see with eve.since dominion, eve has been standing still. ccp starts massive projects, but never completes any. while there is no doubt that shiny trailers and bold plans draw in new players and cause current players to subscribe a few more months, it is not a strategy that works in the long run. a collapse will occur sooner or later.doom and gloom? why?the problems are actually quite comparable to those in the financial world. ccp announces features, launches them as a framework, and then promises to expand on them. nothing wrong there... however, smart (financial) managers realized something. the subscriber base grows with every new expansion. but when releasing an expansion that contains only fixes and no new content, they do not gain any subscribers nor much kudos from the players. thus, why work on old content, especially if it has been recently introduced in a shabby state, when you can hype the new big feature?there are two major problems with this line of thought.the first one is debt. by introducing an unfinished expansion and promising to have devs remain on this feature, ccp basically builds debt. it is an iou-for-these-shiny-features. they have to pay monthly manhours to complete the features, and since there will be unforseen issues, there will be interest as well. ccp continuously miscalculates the monthly pay-off in devtime. thus, progress is slower than usual, and player interest in the new shiny feature starts dropping after a few months. ccp's reaction: ""look, finishing this feature will not impact many players, this monthly devtime is not paying off! lets re-assign these devs to do something more productive!"" ccp defaults on the debt and the feature remains in a broken state. worse than that: defaulting costs ccp's credit rating. by defaulting, player goodwill is lost, and the next time, less players are going to accept an iou.the second one is that eve is currently a big player in the space mmo market. it is quite unique and revolutionary. but will it remain so if expansion continue to be released as they are? unfinished features do not count towards the game. this means that from empyrean age onwards, eve has practically been standing still. ccps business model only works where they are the sole player in their niche. will ccp's business model still work when there are four competitors in their pond (the old republic, jumpgate evolution, black prophecy, infinity)? will eve still be as revolutionary then? will eve's unique selling points outweigh all its flaws?"
5/26/2010,"i would venture to guess that while most live in hisec, it's not a vast majority when you take alts out of the equation.many reasons why lowsec and nullsec are under populated are because the features designed to bring people out there are unfinished and need work.that's like saying you're too sick to go see a doctor."
5/26/2010,"""need for speed"" is ccp's catch-all for fixes to the catch-all term players use: ""lag"" (because lag is not the correct term for 90% of the problems players term lag).the fixes for the ui is a wall of text. they have made a lot of fixes. it is still broken, but they're getting closer.faction/sov warfare is screwy (better than it used to be, but still needs work), i believe pi is part of the fix towards this. so, you might say the centerpiece of this expansion is part of a giant fix for faction/sov warfare.cosmos agents? the low use of cosmos missions is more due to their fixed position in low sec systems making them prime targets for pirates. i think this is by design.what ships are ""completely broken?"" i can't think of a ship in the game right now that doesn't function fairly well in a role. assault frigates are good mission runners when you want to grind standing (sure, that might not be what people want them to be used for, but they are great in that role). destroyers work well for killing off incoming tacklers, this is why the other fleet will kill them early on (sure, everyone wants them to have more tank and various other things so they aren't a suicide ship). i can't think of any other ships that are bad enough to be called ""broken"" by players.what is this ""missing subsystem"" nonsense? what part do you want to add to a t3? an i win button? t3 are dangerously close to already having that. i fly one and feel guilty about how easily it sidesteps even the most elaborate traps set to catch it."
5/26/2010,"just one? man, they could work for 2 years on this list and it would truly make eve a better game."
5/26/2010,"it's already been said elsewhere from a good source the reason the ui is hardly changed is that the art department has put its foot down on the ""look"" of the ui and won't budge.faction warfare is pointless, even the lolrpers are getting tired of it. pi is not meant to do anythin with fw, it's to substain dusties and give reasons to fight.they're few and far between, they are fixed, they are shallow, and overall most don't even bother.any rocket ship with the exception of the heretic is essentially broken because of the weapons. the hawk and vengence are completely broken as they have no actual useful bonuses which makes them almost as broken as black ops... which are broken. most black ops are fitted with the following:improved cloakcovert cynojump portalcargo expandersthat's all they are good for, a pig.ships that are broken? caldari rail platforms, blaster setups on gallente ships, the hel, nid, pilgrim, deimos, and crow to name a few.on to your t3 comment... t3 in many setups are overpowered. that is a balance issue that shows that more work needs to be done to improve them.just because a ship isn't useless does not mean they're good. part of devoting time to ship balancing also involves looking into nerfs.the 5th subsystem was promised by ccp the entire time. and if balanced than it isn't like it makes it more overpowered... they just need to adjust the drawbacks.oh, and the legion is nowhere near overpowered."
5/26/2010,"wow's warden doesn't work.as someone who actually goes out and farms my own mats in that game, i'm very much aware of how prevalent botting is in wow, and how little is being done about it, from the number of bots i keep running into, and those accounts being allowed to bot for months, even after multiple reports to gms from several players.if you attempt to scan for a program, the bot program writers will just write a new program to route around yours, and the kind of people who run bots are happier giving those programs higher security priviledges, than regular game players are to their games. and no i'm not a wow carebear. i'm a dirty twinking b****** (t<U+FFFD>il)."

5/26/2010,rofl.
5/26/2010,"not sure if this has been brought up before, it probably has as imo its a good idea.high sec/low sec consensual pvp arenas, 1v1, 2v2, 4v4, you dock in the station speak to an agent under a new tab, ""consensual pvp"", maybe these agents can be put into a couple of systems per region?tab opens up 1v1, 2v2, 4v4, you can get your mates to come along or recruit people from local, once your and the opposition fleet is full, you are loaded into an instance in the system. or given a bookmark to warp to?obviously ccp will have to do extra work so that neutrals dont get involved, and people cant be added to fleet and warped to the instance, players can put isk down winners take the isk? or place mods down? what you guys think?"
5/26/2010,"they have, it's called ""jet cans""put 1 unit of ammo in there, and get the other guy to take it. allow him to do the same. fight. 2v2 and 4v4 would require more logistics, but it's still possible..."
5/26/2010,what you are thinking of is an arena.if ccp did put on in the game then they would have to follow normal pvp rules. and prolly make it so that outsiders can watch but not interfer via gank or reps.
5/26/2010,um. why do you even need this in low sec? just find a quiet area of space (or a wh) and start blasting each other.
5/26/2010,"hes talking about a controlled fight not a gank off so called pvp,rs killing peeps with no or less skills than they have.it woud be good to have an arena to fight without the possibilty of other griefers interfearing.if ccp realy want to fill 0.0 with players a training ground for the less able players to learn the skill to fit, and fight would be realy usefull.im an indi player and have limmited skills at fighting but would use said facility a lot to learn other skills"
5/26/2010,"an arena basically. yes, i would like this. i feel this would improve the game. people who think this will ruin ""real"" pvp just don't have anything ""real"" worth fighting for."
5/26/2010,"most 0.0 alliances have training corps. some low sec corps/alliances have training programs. slugging it out in a controlled arena would not be a good training tool for fighting in uncontrolled settings. these ""ganks"" others in this thread are talking about are nothing more than someone realizing they're holding the short end of the stick in a fight. eve is an mmo, you are supposed to fly with people. complaining about losing a raven, iteron, whatever when flying through low sec is the way the game is supposed to work. bigger is not better, that is a core tenant in eve that people struggle to learn."
5/26/2010,"i think i know what shubs is getting at. let me see if i can refine the proposal a bit.the stealing-from-jetcans method flags both participants to each other's entire corporation, which allows for too much possibility for interference in what's supposed to be a controlled fight.i propose a mechanic by which two individuals or fleets can challenge each other to a duel in highsec/lowsec space.1) one pilot in space right-clicks another pilot in space in the same solar system and, from the context menu, selects challenge to duel or (if the issuer is a fleet commander or fleet boss) challenge to fleet duel.2) the recipient gets a popup with the options decline, accept for self, and (if also a fleet commander or fleet boss) accept for fleet.3) once accepted, a confirmation window appears for both sides that states the number of ships (but not names or classe) on each side of the duel, present in the solar system when the duel was confirmed. if both sides confirm the duel, then both sides are flagged to each other for dueling (which will be different for being flagged for aggression).anyone can still attempt to help or hinder an active duel participant, but this then becomes a criminal act of some sort. (might consist of being legally shot by everyone and/or a security status loss. concordokken may or may not be too extreme if a non-duelist is just remote repairing a duelist, i don't know.)as duelists either dock up, leave system, go into a disconnect/logoff emergency warp, or lose their ships, their legal participation in the duel ends. the last side standing (that is, to still have any intact ships remaining in space), or the first side to have all their remaining ships in space be uncloaked, not warping, and not shot at for the past three minutes is the winner of bragging rights. this second condition is to prevent someone from ""winning"" a duel by cloaking up at a safespot and waiting for the other side to get bored; it may need to be tweaked.no persistent flags for theft, no security status loss, no concord intervention, no waiting for a war declaration if both sides are ""itching for a fight right now""."
5/26/2010,i like
5/26/2010,any 'pure' pvp'er would argue this is against the sandbox nature of eve.
5/26/2010,"this dumb suggestion is brought up every few months, and it gets the same answer every. single. time."
5/26/2010,no.go to lowsec. go to 0.0. use can aggression. use mutual wardecs.there is no need for pvp arenas for you to have organized consensual pvp.
5/26/2010,"i dont agree with the above statement, but to make posts like this stop happening i would like to suggest something thats currently used on the test server.. simply make a warp to point next to the largest trade hub of each race and it would have ffa-1 (free for all-anyone fights anyone) and one for consentual combat.. people would still have to warp to the spots and drop cans, etc.. or it could be like 0.0 within a 70km radius or something.. however it was implemented it would basically give people a place to meet and preferably let them take it from there.. currently on sisi fd-lmj is full of such sites."
5/26/2010,double post from lag.
5/26/2010,"hello csm and fellow eve players,in the wake of the patch notes being released for tyrannis, there has been alot of complaints about the default privacy settings for evegate and i think it is actually a symptom of a much larger underlying problematic tendency in the development and evolution of eve online. the trend has been with every patch and expansion to grant more and more visibility into every aspect of the game, from the apis to simple added search functionality in the client.let's have a look at what i can find out about your character by simply clicking in the eve client: race, sex, bloodline, security status, character creation date, corporation membership, alliance membership employment history of every corporation you have ever flown with standings to npc factions, corporations and agents (so i know where you do your lvl 4's and 5's) every contract that your character has ever accepted, so yes i know about your officer fitted faction battleship every contract you character has ever created, so i can learn something from what you sell about how you make isk i can even talk to an agent and find out what system you are in right nowthen there are all the things i can find out about your corporation and alliance, where you are based, your numbers, what wars you are involved, etc. on top of that we have these nice apis that allow us to monitor our characters with evemon and import our skillset into eft. these apis are also being used against our privacy. there are very few corporations today that do not ask for your either your limited or full api keys when you apply, giving them access to pretty much everthing there is to know about your characters.and today we get evegate.when i started playing eve we had the escrow system, which was where people traded anything that couldn't be sold on the market. the escrow system was regionally based and the interface was not very intuitive (read: nearly impossible to navigate). the upside to this system however was that if one flew around space for a while you could actually find some good deals. because it was not immediately visible to everyone what the current median price in all regions of a republic fleet warp disruptor was, there was a good chance to get a better deal on one in the minmatar regions than in for instance domain. don't get me wrong, i'm not wishing for the escrow system back (contracts was a big step forward in user friendliness) but i would perhaps argue that it would be better with a regional limit for searching contracts. that is just touching on one of the (in my opinion) negative side effects of the unrestricted access to information. why should i have the ability to see every business transaction another character has ever made? why should i be able to see which npc corporations and agents he does missions for?my point is that i don't think the game necessarily benefits from everyone knowing everything about everyone else. the world becomes smaller when you can search everything globally in a matter of seconds and while that can (sometimes) be a good thing in real life, in a game world it potentially just makes for less of a game. what we have to ask is this: ""is there a reason for this continued disclosure of information about everyone and everything and does the game actually benefit from it?""any thoughts?/argyle jones"
5/26/2010,"so... your complaint about evegate is that everyone (on default) can see everyone else's friend list? because i don't see where you listed a complaint about evegate, other than saying ""and today we get evegate"" like that needed no explanation. your complaints centered around two things in game that have existed for years: ""show pilot info"" and ""pilot contract history."" are those the things you are complaining about or did you have a complaint about evegate?"
5/26/2010,"i'm not complaining about anything, least of all the evegate. i am raising as a point of discussion whether it would be a good idea to look at what sort of character and world information should be publicly accessible to all players and whether it should be globally accessible or only locally to solar system / constellation / region. the above example with the escrow versus contracts system is just one of many such things. as another example let's say i am considering declaring war on your corporation, so i go to show info on your corp and can immedaitely see where your hq is and how many members you have, regardless of where i am in eve and regardless of my standings to you. if i know the names of some of the characters in your corporation i can see where you do your missions and where you tend to do your contracts. should that information be available to me anywhere, at any time without restriction?some possible ways of restricting access to character, corp and world information could be: localization: so in order to find out about your corporation i would have to go to a station where you have an office or a system where you have sovereignty skill restriction: so i would have to train a skill (corporate, business and human intelligence, etc) to increase my search range or functionality skill restriction: as a ceo or security officer in a corp i could train skills (infosec, hehe) that would obfuscate information about my character / corp. standing restriction: if you set bad standings on me i have less acecss to information about your character or corp.so, yeah, don't get me wrong. i'm not complaining that we get evegate, i welcome the new initiative. i just think that we and ccp need to have a discussion about the access to information in eve, especially because we are now getting evegate and information is about to become even more accessible. it seems like ccp's policy for the past few years has been to just make everything visible and accessible to everyone without fully understading the impact that this has on the game world./argyle jones"
5/26/2010,"we live in a time way before eve is portrayed as occuring, with technology far inferior to that portrayed in eve. if you know the name of a person/company/organization, you can google it and get tons of information about them usually. i think this is what eve is trying to portray. the big difference is that people can meta game the system in eve, which is the counter to the basic information gathering you speak of.again, meta gaming is the counter. corps that list their hq as their actual base of operations are either incredibly confident or naive. finding the names of characters in a corp isn't some simple thing, it requires a lot of work. you likely cannot find where an individual does missions, unless they are grinding a single npc corporation. contracts tend to be spread out all over the place, however, for someone not savvy with the system (just like all meta gaming), they can be giving out more information than they mean to.i guess the point is that information gathering and deception is espionage. both sides are alive and well in the game. if you don't believe me, you are welcome to try to find accurate information on the corp i'm in (as an example)."
5/26/2010,"ok, for obvious reasons i cannot log into the game right now, but do the following names mean anything to you?nightstocker, roman lynch, fraud2, lord jasta, 69hush, sum69daz, karanders, axari, matsun, janey bladegurl, weasle350, jonathan davis, sentriz, mediek ordos, bfmreciprocity, spacecutter, kudoka, m41nf4m3, seth scott, shoru minemona and cristopher cook?you mention meta-gaming yourself, and while such gamplay is beyond the control of ccp it still has to be taken into consideration when designing new features. with a little work on eve-search and some killboards i could have a pretty good idea of who is a member of your corp, then combine that with the in-game information available to me about contracts, standings and agents and really get a very clear picture of who you are, what you do, where you do it and how good you are at doing it.my argument is that there ought to be some mechanisms in the game to control this, such as localization, skills and standings. and as you yourself say, today alot of information about people and their doings is available on the internet, which is why corporations and governments pay vasts sums of money for secure communications, encryption of data, secure disposal of data and so on. is there any reason to believe that while the internet would evolve in the future the techniques to protect information would not?/argyle jones"
5/26/2010,by far not all corps require api.
5/26/2010,"interesting thread, it's something i'd like to see get some dev love.of particular concern to me is the api, there is no list on the api page to tell players exactly what information can be read by the api and a lot of people give it out without understanding its implications. espionage and metagaming is one of the things that makes eve special, i don't do it myself because i'd feel hollow making friends with someone i intended to stab in the back but looking at goons, bob and a myriad of other wars it could be classified as the single most powerful weapon in eve. with that in mind it's surprising that more hasn't been done to facilitate wars of intelligence and counter intelligence.one of the biggest ways to protect information is to spread misinformation so a few tools for spreading bull fertilizer could make life interesting:killboard alts: an option whereby your killmails appear on the character sheet of an alt on the same account. this could be used in espionage by creating a false identity as a pvper or in counter espionage by hiding the identity of your main on killmails.api privacy options: seriously i should be able to let someone see my skills and kills without giving them access to my wallet info. api is seriously flawed.character history: stuff like faction standings and contract history can be valuable information so why in a universe full of scumbags are we giving it away for free? there's a whole mini profession waiting to be created by only giving this information to people who have sufficient standings with the relevant brokers/agents.standings bias: why would a matari locator agent give information on someone who has high standings with that faction? it would be fun if the agent sometimes gave false information and then warned the target that player xxxx was trying to gather information on them.those ideas are off the top of my head so there's no doubt flaws but i thought i'd chuck my 0.02 isk in to the thread."
5/26/2010,"how about these then? your ship is blown up. 20 minutes later i pass by click on the wreck and i can see that it was your ship. you deploy a jetcan somewhere. i click the can and i can see that you were the one deploying it. you anchor a pos. you're not at the pos but i can still just right click on it, show info and see that it belongs to your corp. you pilot your internet spaceship into a new solar system and immediately everyone is made aware of your presence. your corp is at war with my corp. i add you to my buddy list (without your consent) and can now see by a little green marker whenever you are onlineeve is just overflowing with information, freely accessible to anyone who cares to look. if corporations and governments of our own world were equally careless with their information we would all be playing the diablo iii alpha right now, only taking a break to read the latest and not yet published harry potter novel, then watch the news and see a reporter listing all the cia safehouses in the middle-east on public television./argyle jones"
5/26/2010,"this is a game, not real life. privacy concerns do exist, but not at nearly the same level that they do in meatspace. if i'm going to worry about privacy settings anywhere, it'd be on facebook, not spacebook."
5/26/2010,"look at you and your meta gaming self. you are listing a bunch of pvp characters though, not sure how this would help (other than to know you need to run if you see one enter local). i have heard that people lie on killboards. call me crazy, but they tend to not be a very accurate representation of reality.again, someone searching for information can meta game to find it. someone trying to protect their information can easily put out piles of other/false information to obfuscate reality. this is the way it works in reality as well as eve.these two, i will agree wholeheartedly with you on. these need to be fixed."
5/26/2010,"stop typing in all caps you moron..oh, i added a new item to the list too!"
5/26/2010,supported
5/26/2010,thank you gentlemen!
5/26/2010,"however, now that you have been re-elected i hope you will support a war-dec and bounty hunting reform...reform, by the way not nerf, not removal, not crippling.the current war-dec system is a joke. the bounty system is so bad that it isn't even funny. textwall incoming soon."
5/26/2010,"having been well-trained by virtuozzo, i am looking forward to your wot."
5/26/2010,"this proposal shall address two issues: the highly debated cloak system and the lack of support for destroyers.new role: the proposed t2 destroyer will act as an anti-cloak and frigate boat with higher resists and increased powergrid/cpu to allow for more fitting opportunities, and higher potential damage output than the t1 variant.how does work?it uses a module in the high slot, much like a bomber, that launches a non-damaging depth charge. this depth charge is fired in a spread pattern to the rear of the ship and explodes as an area of effect from the ship itself and de-cloaks enemy (non-fleet) ships within that set range, e.g. an aoe of 20 km or smaller. it should be minimal enough for it to work, but not large enough to be overpowered.what things should be changed (in regard to cloak)?ships within fleet should be able to fly together without de-cloaking one another. they cannot see each other and they cannot see other enemy cloaked ships. afk cloaking should remain the same since this new addition is meant to search for the enemy.why does the depth charge not deal any damage?the goal is to reveal the enemy, not destroy them like a spamming stealth bomber. we dont want to take away from what was already given to the stealth bomber. yes, historically the depth charge was an offensive weapon however we want to use this to only reveal in order to discourage overuse and fairness for both parties. cloaked ships already have the opportunity to make a decision once this t2 destroyer flies on grid.what about afk cloaking and local?i see no reason to change an unbroken mechanic in that means because being afk and terrorizing the enemy is still allowed and always encouraged. removing local could have beneficial and also incredibly disastrous results for everyone and i would see no need to change it.why a destroyer?i chose destroyer because it needs a little love at the moment. right now, we have more frigate and cruiser platforms than the destroyer and the destroyer is rather limited in what it can currently do. ideally it was created as an anti-frigate platform and was merely an up-gunned frigate much like a battlecruiser is to a cruiser and thus, should reflect that. historically, the destroyer was used both as an escort for convoys and to eliminate small surface and sub-surface contacts; in this case, frigates, destroyers and cloaked ships.how is this prevented from being overused?since it is a t2 ship, you will undoubtedly be slowed by training time and the depth charge launcher module can only be used on this particular ship. probing has been proposed in the past however it was noted by ccp that this was impossible to do so since the game considered the cloaked ship out of existence and to change that would allow for potential exploits and scripting.much like a covert ops ship, this t2 destroyer isnt a necessity, but is a convenience for anyone who chooses to use it and thus isnt required to bring along in fleet engagements. it will negatively affect any cloaking ships that choose to disregard their own safety like sitting too close to a celestial object or a stargate. this allows a party to have the opportunity to decloak a ship however it isnt guaranteed to work. cloaking mechanics aside from friendly fleet bumping remains unchanged and cloaked ships still have the same opportunities they had before."
5/26/2010,same idea has been proposed several times before already.
5/26/2010,"in regards to a new t2 destroyer? absolutely. however:new module and combat tactic ideas + medium assault shiptrue t2 destroyersboomer class (tech 2 destroyer sb)new t2 destroyera converted assault destroyer, weird grappling beams and ramming, using probes and another stealth bomber are not what i'm proposing."
5/26/2010,"i have personally brought up the depth charge idea, it's somewhere in my post history"
5/26/2010,"your first and most major flaw .... smart area of effect?it either decloaks everyone or nobody.but then again the idea is stupid to begin with ... let me just give you an example.you run your resupplies in your little viator through 0.0 to your home system. suddenly a gate camp on the in-gate. as normal you use you cloak and pulse the mwd to get out of the bubble and warp. but bam ... the decloak module fires, your cloak drops. the ceptor tackles you and you are toast.skills required by them? almost 0. chance of your survival. also almost 0. chance of them farming kills close to 100%. without the module i would give you about 2/3 chance of getting out. and 1/3 to them to get the kill, if they got fast/smart ceptor pilots.we really dont need to buff gate/bubble camping more. and your training time argument is kind of irrelevant ... it is a one time gap. once you got the skill everyone and their mother will have 2-3 of those decloakers in their roaming gangs.and xtover is right, this idea is not new at all.that said ... not supported."

5/26/2010,"did you know that 10% (the rich) of the population pay 68% of the taxes in the us.yet people who make less money still insist on taking more from them even though they pay less..why does that transfer into eve where bpo producers who work hard to earn their isk and use it to buy super expensive bpos to allow us to have quality ship fittings at a cheaper price, yet the ones who happen to make less isk complain that they arent in the same boat when they have not done as much to get do the same, expect the in game government(ccp) to take from the richer players and spread what they have to others so they can feel equal in game and make similar amounts for less the work.we do not need socialism in eve. its a capitalist type economy and if some 10 year old is off in a distant solar system in some version of a sweat hangar working his fingers to the bone for pennies to allow me to have cheaper costing ships and fittings so i can go warring and pirating to kill innocent players who dont know any better and other skilled pilots for alot less isk then i for one say... dont touch a darn thing !! also tell that kid to work faster !! inflation is raising prices and if he doesnt put out faster tell him he will get a pay cut!"
5/26/2010,"duel or triple rep myrm can have an absolute beast of a tank. you get jumped on a gate, just don't agress and run back to the gate. myrms are slow (especially when webbed) but unless its a big camp you should be able to get back to the gate ok, and ofc the agressors then wont be able to jump through after you. or if its low sec and your tank is holding, just point them and watch as the glorious gate guns of much victory give you some free kills. ;)this is dependant on you being pvp fit of course. if you aren't then don't cry emo tears if you get popped in low sec. if you dont want 'thugs' then low sec really isnt a place you want to travel to."
5/26/2010,"the eve store sucks, the products are scarce, its like going to a covience store in the ghetto and all the stuff is expired and dusty, and you know its really a front for a drug operation, anyways back on topic...the shirts: needs more variety, there is about 4 shirts totalthe hats: suckthe accessories: what accessories?the ship models: no scale, and 1 picture per, needs a jerkoff dev holding the model up in the picturedid i mention there isnt anything being sold in the eve store?"
5/26/2010,so what am i considering my support on?
5/26/2010,"i know its been brought up before, i dont care! get ccp to revert back to the old cynosural field graphic, its so much better then the crap one we have atm"
5/26/2010,"i think they have in the new expansion, i recall reading it in the patch notes. may be wrong..."
5/26/2010,=(
5/26/2010,full results can now be read in this dev blog.
5/26/2010,"none of that is proof.1. it's marketting not pr. pr was when hilmar promised a solution to the t20 problem in the new york times. marketing is the csm.2. ccp developed eve long before the csm they never wanted us to have.3. i see you're in line for a free holiday, and your bias couldn't be more obvious therefore.4. that's why you think any of that is proof of anything. which it absolutely is not.can the lies please stop?your ridiculous attempt at providing proof has missed out the following important issues that do not suit your new free holiday:-1. ccp never mentioned anything about csms until they got caught sponsoring cheating by a whistleblower who got banned.2. ccp promised a strong independent csm that could and would ensure t20 could never happen again.3. ccp introduced a weak marketing exercise called the csm and promised at release that it will never be able to force ccp into any action at all ever under any circumstances.4. ccp have developed and continue to develop eve online without regard for what the csm has to say, which is how it should be.thus far, the only thing we can say with absolute certainty about the csm is that is has actually enabled key people to cheat ironically the opposite of what we were originally told it would be for.and before you start crying, you seem to be good at internet searching, but maybe now is a good time to start practising looking up information you don't like."
5/26/2010,i would like to take this opportunity to say congratulations to all of the successful candidates in the csm elections.it was a very enlightening process and i would salute those candidates who put a lot of effort into their campaign (win or lose) and those rose above the mud-slinging to provide interesting debate. i may not be flying to iceland (on someone else's dollar anyway) but i hope i can help in some way with the csm process regardless. good luck guys :)
5/26/2010,"did i mention yet that you are wrong on several points? no? because you sure as hell are, but don't let that change your view of things.please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
5/26/2010,"it used to be the first to say ""troll"" wins. now it is attempted that the first person who says ""hater"" wins.in reality, both have always been capitulation. thanks for conceding. you could have done it in a way so that your less intelligent fanboiz could understand it though.hopefully they can see it.claim victory.say hater.run like hell.feel free to look up and understand things you don't want to read. try it some time. it will make you more powerful.though it's certainly not a requirement to get on a plane to iceland and have long conversations about what colour toilet paper ccp should use, or perhaps some topics that ccp will simply ignore anyway.bye bye small fry."
5/26/2010,"since you cannot be bothered to educate yourself about the topic at hand, i feel no need to make any effort towards you. your cheap shots at me and the csm are mere symptoms of your voluntary ignorance. some people will just hate the concept of the csm, which is fine. in the meantime i will be trying to actually use the tools that ccp have handed us in order to improve the game for everyone. contrary to ankh and her puzzle pirates, i am actually relevant in eve."
5/26/2010,"your assertion that i am not educated is incorrect. to be honest, if i had your skills and your bias, i too would scream soundbites and hide from a clearly superior opponent. since you have chosen that stance, could you do it quietly?you won't be improving eve at all. it's really that simple. ccp will be improving eve. you'll be getting patted on the head and you will be told by your idols that you are doing really well, but you won't be achieving a single thing that you will comprehend.if you think different, try changing something ccp don't want you anywhere near. go on... i know you won't. ankh won't get her weird ideas implemented. it simply won't happen.unfortunately this tactic is entirely contractory to your blind insistence that you are now empowered. you will not see your next year of utter pointlessness and failure as anything other than unlimited power to wield over eve. there is plenty of counter to your bizarre assertions, but until you have grown to the point where you can counter your own argument, you will remain as weak as you appear today.just keep it simple. say ""troll"" say ""hater"" and walk away. it's pretty much all you're any use for. which is ample qualification for the csm.it's clear you need the last word, and frankly, since you're part of ccp's marketing machine now, and i refuse to carry that role for them, i'm the one about to be forum banned if i continue this any further, you'd better just take that last word and make it sizzle yeah? you got a legion of csm fanboiz just waiting for you to burn the heretic publicly.go ahead small fry. make me burn."
5/26/2010,le sigh wear tinfoil to fanfest..or ccp might get into your head and make you think they actually mean well.
5/26/2010,"after i posted the various links to what ankh's said, i most definitely increased the number of people who want to gank her for being an idiot who could wind up as csm chair."
5/26/2010,"ank came in second in the elections, followed by dierdra vaal. the 2 candidates i wanted in most made it with overwhelming support. even that ol' sourpuss sok made it in, though barely. don't think he'll be able to bake his cookies now though."
5/26/2010,"*cough* why dont you tell us whom came first?(and that didn't require spamming trade hubs and evemails, lying to other players about other candidates to get missionrunner panic votes and the like)really pleased the e-uni candidate got in, that's the kind of balanced response needed on the csm that has wider views and associates with more than a monoculture of the players."
5/26/2010,look at you.
5/26/2010,"i see you have already started the smear campaign for the next elections and why don't you tell us who came fourth?see, i can ask pointless questions too..."
5/26/2010,"eva,congratulations on not making chair, it couldn't happen to a more deserving idiot.eagerly awaiting your next ******ed flash game,niraia"
5/26/2010,"if you'd look up the messages she was spamming, you would find they were actually lies, half-truths and scaremongering aimed at herding ignorant folk into voting for her."
5/26/2010,"you are literally the worst csm ever, and that includes darius 'im loud and drunk"" johnson."
5/26/2010,"okay, first things first, everything i said was true. legitimate criticism hurts huh. better call it a smear campaign.now, as for pointless questions, you made a point of not congratulating the person that got the most votes and whom becomes chairwoman.bitters much?be magnanimous at what has been achieved and try and live with the fact someome thats obviously immoral and a real life sociopath because they pvp is the chair.predicting thread lock fairly soon."
5/26/2010,"just so we're clear: does ""smear"" mean ""tell unpleasant truths about someone"" to you?"
5/26/2010,and here are the results of the vote
5/26/2010,we will have teadaze in csm this time to document all the amusing things ank says. looking forward to the meeting minutes for this csm!
5/26/2010,"and with td, no-one will be able to accuse us of being unfair or inaccurate in our transcripts!"
5/26/2010,"why would i be bitter if my 2 fav candidates got voted in with such huge support? that was what i was pointing out.you asking me why i did not say who came in first is as relevant to that as asking me why i did not say what i had for lunch today that being said, i would like to congratulate all elected members, that includes sourpuss sok. even if he is an alliance puppet."
5/26/2010,"if you knew me, you'd realise that i'm probably as far away from an 'alliance puppet' as possible. i have been accused of getting in through bloc vote before so i will repeat my argument here.aaa is probably the least coherent alliance in-game when it comes to the csm elections. the russian community is very tight-knit so most of them will vote for korvin. most of the bdci votes went to omber zombie, a good part to other candidates (teadaze was popular), and most of the rest just doesn't give a **** about the csm."
5/26/2010,"i'm just yanking your chain m8 . even if you did get in through powerbloc voting, that's the way elections work: rally enough ppl to vote for you."
5/26/2010,congrats on being the head of csm 5.
5/26/2010,chairmistress o7
5/26/2010,it was simply a matter of time congrats hun and i expect to be smuggled in your luggage to ccp as discussed now go whip those devs into shape!
5/26/2010,congrats!
5/26/2010,congrats mynxee!i'm confident you will be awesome and give us plenty of reasons to grin from ear to ear!(already doing that ) =huggles=
5/26/2010,congratulations!
5/26/2010,gratz on the big win
5/26/2010,"i've always thought webs fit the bill better. i mean, the docking mechanic is supposed to be like a tractor beam, webs are supposed to function in a similar fashion. easy to reconcile the idea that you are preventing the station tractor beam from pulling the ship in.just my two cents. also, congrats mynxee!"
5/26/2010,thanks everyone that showed support. i will not disappoint you!
5/26/2010,thank god no muppetshow
5/26/2010,congratulations
5/26/2010,"gratz, sok. 2 votes well spent"
5/26/2010,i want to thank the 800 plus pilots of eve that voted for me! i'm sorry i will not be able to represent the care bears and casual players of eve but at least folks that play puzzle pirates will be well represnted in the new csm! it was a great election and in the end i think this new csm (mostly) will bring great things to eve over the next year.again thanks to everyone that participated in the csm process and especially the folks that offered me their direct support in this election!issler dainzenot your next csm representative and not a player of puzzle pirates

5/26/2010,congrats on not being elected
5/26/2010,"congratulations eve, you've managed to hire the 1 person who wants to destroy your game.campaigning on points like- ""vote carebear and get their griefer ass banned!""- ""other csm candidates want level 4 missions moved to lowsec""due to the sheer amount of out-there, anti-pvp, anti-eve propaganda, you must wonder, is ank just a troll? is he actually just sitting there laughing at the fact he campaigned to turn eve into hello kitty online, and won?oh god we could go on for hours, but this isn't a forum to discuss this player's many low points. (unless it gets him canned!) we're here to discuss how to get him canned off the csm board.let the plotting/planning begin!"
5/26/2010,"tbh it's not that bad. she'll try to do the things she wants but pretty much everybody else on the csm thinks that she's a complete ****. all that's going to happen is she's going to be trolled and have fun poked at her until she cries.i await videos, please record videos"
5/26/2010,really done the research haven't you!
5/26/2010,"put a lot of thought and many points into your post, didn't you!i could have listed the many, many, maaaany reasons as to why the majority of eve think he shouldn't have gotten a single vote. however, you can just browse the many, maaaany threads on here for those. i'm not about to regurgitate them all, i just wanted to give a few quick examples.anyhow, i'm pretty sure we should be looking at his campaign trail that has probably left ccp's mail servers full. is it legal for a csm candidate to spam fear mongering evemails to noob carebears in order to scare them into voting?what about other sly/dubious techniques like providing a link named ""cast your vote!"". nothing wrong with that? the link never took you to the page full of csm candidates, the link was to directly cast your vote for ank. yeah, most smart people wouldn't have accidentally clicked accept, but bundled into the eve website's login system, it is fairly easy for someone to passively click accept without reading what the page says.also, seriously, im pretty sure ank just trolled all of eve and ccp. he's probably just waiting for his free trip to iceland before he announces it."
5/26/2010,"dude, start by watching the video..."
5/26/2010,who is this 'he' that ank will be taking to iceland?
5/26/2010,"she's not going to get booted from the csm. we get to deal with her. fortunately, we have a bunch of sane csms who will shoot down anything dumb she proposes. and, in her defence, a lot of what she asks for is perfectly reasonable."
5/26/2010,just set up gank squads and kill her every time she undocks in eve instead.
5/26/2010,"a csm actually playing eve, heh"
5/26/2010,8 vs 1
5/26/2010,"please just stop sok i had some amount of respect for you till this csm campaign.yes she can be annoying as hell and she makes some really stupid comments, but alot of what she says makes sense and adding to the pve side of the game will remove nothing from the pvp side and tbh anything that makes grinding isk for pvp more fun gets a + in my book.she got over 3k votes compared to the rest of you barely scrapping 1-2k apart from minxee, so she must be saying something that the playerbase agrees with.everyone who plays eve has to pve at some point for iskies ( well mostly ) and making this more fun or less boring is a good thing, not everyone pvps."
5/26/2010,which one?the one where you gives your fakes views on eve?or the one where you support software pirates irl?
5/26/2010,"most likely the one where it is clear that ankhesentapemkah is a she not a he.for op, other than being so misinformed about basic well known fact about canidate's gender, the csm election is over. someone you really do not think should have been elected, did get elected. maybe you can file a petition with gm."
5/26/2010,"if this were so then the majority of eve forfitted their chance to vote for someone else.just to be a tad clear, a lot of threads about ankh were actually started by people who wanted to blackball her, which in turn resulted in her increased exposure during the votes.if you want to keep a certain candidate out of the high profile you don't do so by having a lot of people starting threads about this person.call it whatever you want, she did manage to put up a campaign which ensured her a seat in the csm, the way she might have or not have done it is a whole other matter.as for people just bluntly clicking accept, isn't that one thing you learn in eve to get over real fast?this last part clearly showed you're mainly hopping on a popular bandwagon in ankh bashing without even knowing what you are talking about.atleast be a descent troll and get the gender of a csm delegate right."
5/26/2010,"she got votes representing 1% of the eve subscription base. i hardly think that shows that ankh is ""saying something that the playerbase agrees with"". you're extrapolating off of insufficient data.that said, i'm curious if ankh would have made it had ccp used a more rational voting system, like stv."
5/26/2010,"i think sok's point is not that the 8 will always gang up on the 1 just because, but that if she proposes something truly stupid like ""jail time for criminals!!!1"" that there are 8 people who actually like the game and can play it on the csm that can easily override it.on the other hand sensible suggestions concerning her very limited area of expertise can be discussed and supported just like any other. i'm sure that she could make an excellent case that there are plenty of improvements that can be made to fw plexes, for instances."
5/26/2010,malcanis uses common sense++ its super effective!
5/26/2010,that's the point i tried to make but it went over his head.
5/26/2010,she wants to protect the game from people like you.
5/26/2010,"well, as far as i can see the 1% if the playerbase cared more about who got into the csm than all those who didn't vote.basicly she representes a larger chunk of voters than all but 1 currently in the csm.when you want to extrapolate you should atleast be honest enough to say that a large part of the eve voters found her suitable for a place in the csm.next to that she is one of 9 people there.it might actually be so that csm communicate and as such come to issues to raise. also voting is a right, not a mandatory thing to play the game. if so many people would have minded her to get in then why have only so little voted?"
5/26/2010,"the only reason that many bears voted for her (and that they voted *at all*) was because she spammed all the busy systems silly with lies, slander and fearmongering. she was going to 'ban all the griefers' and 'oppose all the others who want to move lvl 4's to lowsec', to name but a few slogans she used."
5/26/2010,"you seem to be full of hatred. is it your only concern and your only agenda of your csm candidature to spill rage and insults towards another csm who got more than 3 times the votes you got?if so, and obsiously this is true, you are a watse as a csm. go on with that attitude and i am sure, you will not make it next time."
5/26/2010,and i am 100% convinced that in your alliance nobody urged to vote for you and that you are a truthfull person with an open mind.
5/26/2010,"quiet, alt. quiet, other alt. p.s. guys, stop whining. yes, ankhybonkybonkers is manifestly unqualified for any role in eve more complicated than ""target"". so play the game like ccp designed it and prove your point. we have alt-spies and locator agents for a reason."
5/26/2010,"mistaken gender? on the internets?! no way!you throw in a harmless mistake, and present it as a reason to discredit my entire post? then you go and point out the obvious, trying to make it seem like i didn't understand this to begin with, and then tell me to do something pointless/stupid?do you work for fox news by any chance?anyhow...not really. see what happened was, all the informed players voted for other people, and ank harvested the votes from scared newbs in newb systems/carebear mission hubs. if ank had not been allowed to terrorize the carebears with his fearmongering evemails, he/she/it probably wouldn't have even made the backup teamthat is not what im doing here. before the votes finsihed, i was encouraging people to vote abstain. now that its all settled, we can clearly see why csm is a bit of a sham. i find it hard to believe even 10% of the eve population wants to ban pvp'ers to nullsec. but ank gets to speak for 10% of eve?vote fraud? lying in order to win your vote? misleading you into clicking her vote button? ""owell"" ? lol i guess this is why us ended up with bush for so long eh?if bashing ankh is a popular bandwagon, perhaps theres reason for it? i mean, it couldnt possibly be all the dumb **** she's said eh? must be just a bunch of hooligans hating on poor little ankhand again, mistaking gender on the internets.... ohnoes...."
5/26/2010,"i'm more concerned that a member of the csm is going to be more focused on trying to show that another member is inept, rather than actually doing the job he was voted for.if ank suggest something stupid, it gets voted down as will any other stupid idea other people have. she's not the only person to suggest something utterly idiotic during this campaign either and those people got seats too, where's the tears?"
5/26/2010,"the only one ""manifestly unqualified"" are you. who are you anyway to make that call, alt? show yourself instead posting with your hate-infused troll character."
5/26/2010,"quiet, yet another alt."
5/26/2010,"well, the election results are in. seems like the hate offensive did not work or even backfired as ank got more votes than ever b4. *waits for e-tribune journalists to come and emo-rage about ank and her voters some more."
5/26/2010,"emo-rage? no. we're of course disappointed that such a manifestly unqualified and duplicitous candidate was elected, but really the people who are going to be most screwed over by her election are her voters, who will lack the effective representation needed to support their interests and that of the game."
5/26/2010,ankhesentapemkah is a qualified game designer.
5/26/2010,"well all that came out of this ridiculous thread is the eve tribune can no longer claim to be unbiased or neutral within eve, shame really"
5/26/2010,"ah, another person who isn't aware of editorials or political endorsements. sad, really. but of course the tribune has never claimed we don't have ""bias"". most tribune writers would readily admit that they have a bias towards liking eve and that they want it to continue. they also like how ccp designed it (in general) and they are happy that it's a pvp based mmo and not a single player game. the fact that pvp is possible in every system of the game isn't an accident, nor did it just happen that ccp advertises the end-game content as combat rather than mining a really big asteroid. it's the reason why ccp sponsors a massive, regular pvp tournament and not a lvl 4 mission jamboree. it's the reason why we have locator agents, and war decs, and why when you lose your ship you don't just get resurrection sickness and go pick up your ship and mods and go back out to fly. if someone logged into a team fortress 2 server and complained that everybody else was a psychopathic virgin for shooting at them while they were playing a medic, it wouldn't be an act of ""bias"" to point out that person simply didn't get it."
5/26/2010,"when i got the email from ccp diagoras, my first act was to check the headers to make sure my corpies weren't punking me.in all seriousness, i was totally shocked to learn i had been elected. i ran because i felt that it was important to raise awareness of some significant issues, and i would have been overjoyed if i received more than a few hundred votes. to get almost 1500 is truly astounding.thank you to everyone who voted for me!now, of course, the hard work begins. look for me to be very active on and off the forums helping to craft specific, implementable proposals, both large and small, that will improve the game.ps: i have set up a special email address, trebor-csm [at] animeigo.com for anyone to use when they want to bring csm-related matters to my attention."
5/26/2010,~2 hours till i can download the client. you'd better have fixed the ui and solved lag by then.
5/26/2010,didn't you vote sok?
5/26/2010,"i tried, but ran into a nasty case of lag-fixing meta-lag."
5/26/2010,"better luck next time, mate.i pesonally have lost a great portion of faith in the community. you must have gotten in. meh."
5/26/2010,bad luck on not getting a csm spot m8 hope you stick around and try again next year.
5/26/2010,"we actually got within 60 votes of being an alternate, but whatevs hopefully the people that got elected will pay attention to some things we raised. i think i know how to do it next time: claim to fix lag and spam local"
5/26/2010,"congrats, cat :)oh...wait..."
5/26/2010,and may 26th has arrived.looks eva's in and you are out. the tribe has spoken.mr epeen
5/26/2010,"i want to thank all those who voted for me. let us hope those that did make it show they deserved it by their actions not their words, or we shall all suffer."
5/26/2010,to all who voted for me thank you your support it is much appreciated.sorry i wasn't successful in getting a seat .thanks again.
5/26/2010,i'd like to thank everyone who voted for me. i can't pretend i'm not disappointed at the result but i promise i'll attend the online meetings to try and tone down some of the terrible ideas that many of the full delegates have already put forwards as part of their platforms. i feel that csm v will be a poor advocate for anyone who cares about the game and i hope that some of the more divisive elements can be neutralised quickly.
5/26/2010,"good luck with that. it sounds like you will need it.also, congrats on getting back in (even though as an alt)."
5/26/2010,lol. i voted for you and t'amber and you both came in 1 vote apart and as alternates :(at least the other person i voted for made it.
5/26/2010,results @ no2
5/26/2010,yes but the first order of business will be for no1 to kick no2 in the ****
5/26/2010,cat fight whooooooo
5/26/2010,i don't see a cat.
5/26/2010,touch<U+FFFD>!
5/26/2010,@4
5/26/2010,"lol, andrea!"
5/26/2010,i heard vuk lau already has dibs on diagoras.c/d?
5/26/2010,"much like all ccp employees, i'm ridiculously attractive."
5/26/2010,adjusted to reflect the truth slightly better/
5/26/2010,don't you all wear beer goggles?
5/26/2010,"congratulations, teadaze!obviously not only i appreciated your solid work in csm4.imho your efforts towards better communication with the playerbase lead to better election turnout.go tea!"
5/26/2010,congrats teadaze. good job.
5/26/2010,"congratulations jason, nice to be with you."
5/26/2010,looks like you actually didn't make it in.
5/27/2010,please finally get it done ccp...
5/27/2010,need love
5/27/2010,"in addition to the op, christ no. as an alternative, the drone bay change seems reasonable enough, though i'm not a fan of the second turret, because it's still a command ship and still ought to have a utility high to fit the warfare link. i don't want it to have the same problem the astarte has in that regard(speaking of which, if you want an astarte buff i'd like, +1 high, +160 pg, +40 cpu would be nice...even though i know most people would just fit a medium neut ). also, +1 turret is a pretty big bonus, especially on a ship with dual dps bonuses. i don't think the absolution needs that much of a buff. but a bit more drone space, getting it up to harby levels, is fine by me."
5/27/2010,"i inflated a little, but you are forgetting some stuff: overheat your neutrons, switch over to caldari navy am (which is cheap), and add a rof/dmg rig and you sit pretty at just under 1000 dps flat. double-up the rigs and add a reactor control for fitting to push it over 1k. yeah, sure, its paper thin but it goes the distance if noone primaries you. for a tier 1 ship, that's pretty smoking. stack another 200 on for the astarte. id admit barring cost id take the astarte, but if someone gave me an astarte plus fittings, id probably sell it off and purchase 4 harbys or 5 brutixs.for the astarte, the wasted bonus is the repping amount. im seriously wondering what ccp was thinking if they weren't thinking ""its not a large hac!"" giving it a full rack of turret slots. fields werent really made (either in cost or bonus) to fit command links."
5/27/2010,"i was assuming cn am to get 860. i tend to prefer trimark rigs to dps on most fits, because dps are stacking nerfed against your magstabs, which makes them fairly pointless(10-15% ehp > 2-5% dps). and i tend to standardize on all-v skills and no overheating - since every ship gets roughly the same bonus from overheating, it just makes the numbers confusing to include it. as for cost efficiency, yes, the astarte is pretty bad in that regard. but sometimes you want capability over redundancy, and there's not much above command ships for capability."
5/27/2010,"i did write up a few paragraphs here and just decided that i did not have enough room to continue. that said i like option 3. it gives those character / players a massive bonus for spending the time training and planning their characters. we get the benefit of learning skills faster over the past few years and we get one final thank you for the sp getting applied to skills to train them very fast. all players now train at the same rate unless you have implants. implants will become in high demand which will drive up their price in the short term. new players will not be faced with useless skill training to train skills.this allows those older characters to be able to look back and remember something else fondly or egregiously depending on your perspective. ultimately ccp is a fool if they indeed ever mentioned any task and used the phrase ""what can we do that will not make people angry"" regardless the choice, some will be angry. some will threaten to quit, some might even do just that. but if a decision is to be made i think that this is a good one. all new players train at the same speed as vets. vets got a bonus for being here and working hard. new players cant be angry about it. old players should not have sold their account. vets, well we did our time, and have to go slow like everyone else now but we were rewarded for our service."
5/27/2010,liang i can justify the gap widening because when i started a few years later than other players who had trained the skills the same thing happened to me. several years down the line it isn't an issue anymore for me at all. too many ppl view it as a game that you should be able to do everything fast like every other online game which is surprising to me because the main reason i like eve is because it is so radicaly different from all the others.just my thoughts and i accept other ppl want different goals.
5/27/2010,"i completely agree. i am at 6 mil sps, with 2.5 mil in learning. noone told me that ccp was trying to remove them, so i would be upset if they just disappeared. however, the proposed solution of essentially distributing the points to other skills sounds fair.as a new character starting in the game, i was faced with a choice: have fun and learn useful skills now or sit and wait until learning trains up, so i can be more useful later. it was not a fun choice and it does hurt the new player experience. the fast learning of the first 1.6 mil helps, but is not nearly enough for those sp-hungry advanced skills.now that i am done with about half the learning skills, i am proud of them. but i would be just as proud if i had that extra 2.5 mil sp in gunnery or spaceship command."
5/27/2010,"i believe the op was considering that the 3 together would be the total solution(max attributes that a character can have, so that everyone would be equalized). then all the learning skills would be removed, finally the bonus sp used already(often by people training using there bonus sp time) would then be applied at a bonus rate, equal to what was already learned."
5/27/2010,"we. dont. make. them. do. this. you. liar.it really is laughable that in the very first paragraph of your attempted refutation, you exactly illustrate my point. in no way, shape or form are new players ""made"" to sit around for any period of time doing nothing fun in the game. it is only their own perception - or, far more frequently the god-awful advice of people like you - that leads them to do this.you are implicitly assuming that they should do the efficient thing at the expense of fun. that is the living definition of ""mini-maxing"".new players can and should be out doing fun stuff from day 1. this is perfectly compatible with training learning skills some but not all of the time.i know that's a pretty complex and radical concept but once you understand it, it's awesome.i'm not even going to address your terrible restatement of the never catch up fallacy, as it has been refuted so many times that i can only assume that you're trolling."
5/27/2010,"original proposal supported. +1your extra proposal supported, too. i've always considered the learning implants a huge reason people don't go pvp en masse: it's one thing to lose a ship; but regularly losing 600+ mil worth of +5 implants, who can afford that? yes, you can always clone-jump; but if you have to do so every other day, then it's like not having them half the time, after all. +1"
5/27/2010,"the competition was fierce, but liang takes the failure at eve prize for this thread.entries still open however.btw, how do you justify me as an older player being able to fly a battleship just because i trained the battleships skill?"
5/27/2010,"ccp are no longer looking to remove learning skills. it is true that they regretted introducing them but since ccp have introduced the skill queue, neural remap and learning speed bonus and since there are so many players strongly for the use of learning skills they see no reason to do so. not supported."
5/27/2010,"don't give them any ideas. the next proposal will be ""since we all pay subs why don't we have every skill maxed as standard because it's an unfair advantage to only be able to fly rookie ships when we start""?"
5/27/2010,"semantics. liang is absolutely right.nobody is literally forcing anyone to not go do fun stuff. yet the very existence of the learning skills will cause any reasonably sensible person to gravitate towards doing the learning skills first. simple as that. yes, a newbie could go train battleship iv at 1320 sp/h. sure. but only an extremely short-sighted person will keep that up for very long. most folks grasp that doing learning skills first, so you can afterwards train at 2772 sp/h, is probably ever-so slightly more efficient. so, only a masochist, or a blithering idiot, will purposely train at way too slow speeds.hence, liang is right: learning skills make you do learning first, however loud you decry the fact."
5/27/2010,"so, paying to play a game, playing in a way which offers you no fun, and boring yourself out of said game (i.e. the ""noob who is driven out by the learning skills"" story) is reasonable?straw man. a noob will not be training for battleships day 1. furthermore, bses are so far down the line that many levels of the learning skills will actually speed it up rather than make it take longer.only a masochist or a blithering idiot will minmax at the cost of enjoyment of a game."
5/27/2010,"yeah, it is, actually. it's like being in school: sure, it's always more fun to go outside and play baseball, or go to the mall and hang with your friends. sooner or later most students 'get' it though: a little less fun in the now will increase it manifold later.so, if you find that unreasonable, then you're actually saying the learning skills system is unreasonable. but within the learning skills system, yes, learning first is the sensible, reasonable thing to do. which is why it should be changed.semantics, again; replace 'battleship iv' with 'any skill that takes longer than a few days.' because that's the issue: nobody is gonna feel the slow-training of, say, 'frigate i'. but people will feel the impact when it comes to longer skills. and even when noobs will be training many short skills first, their falling behind catches up with them rapidly. there's just no way around it: don't do learning skills, and your initial 'fun' will turn sour pretty fast.if by 'enjoyment' you mean 'instant gratification,' then yes. it's a good thing most people can look beyond that, though; which is why the learning skills are a bad thing."
5/27/2010,"did you see the part where i italicised game? think about that.in rl you do unfun things for a long-term benefit. that's life. if you do that in a game, you are probably doing it wrong.so noobs doing early skills, who i say should train little or no learning skills, will feel no loss in not having the learning skills, until they start training longer skills, the point at which i suggest they do the learning skills, and the point at which they would start to feel the loss.wow. i think the phrase 'working as intended' pretty much sums that up.falling behind what?there is no raceengage brainattempt to comprehendrace no there isthere race is nono race is thereetcalso, i didn't do the learning skills straight away on any characters except dedicated research alts and the like, and my fun never 'turned sour'. in fact, the only people who seem to have that problem are the people who do do them straight away. so stop talking ****.false dichotomy; there is a gray area between instant gratification and pure minmaxing, though i wouldn't be surprised if you can't see it.furthermore you assume a scale from instant grafication ('fun') to minmaxing ('not fun'), when an individual's idea of fun may actually be located anywhere in that spectrum."
5/27/2010,"*sigh*you're making exactly the same unproven assumption as liang. that one must be ""efficient"". and you're also employing the fallacy of the excluded middle by implying that there's no middle ground between doing no learning skills at all, and doing nothing but learning skills.since i specifically mention the concept of training some learning skills mixed up with other skill types, i can only assume that you're being deliberately dishonest.it's just as bad for a new character to train nothing but learning skills as it would be for the to train nothing except engineering, or nothing except social skills. if there's one thing a brand new player should not be doing it is focusing exclusively on any one skill group.given that seemingly obvious (i say 'seemingly', because apparently it's not obvious to you) principle, how on god's green earth can you possibly assert that new players are ""made to train nothing but learning""? so far from being made to, it's seemingly obvious they should do nothing of the sort.unless you're a helplessly obsessive-compulsive minimaxer, of course the only significant problem with learning skills is griefers (and i use the word deliberately) like you telling new players that they must train learning skills first. you should be ashamed of yourself, because that's a mean thing to do to someone who doesn't know any better."
5/27/2010,"um, yeah! :) because to stake a position that one should play a game deliberately inefficiently is just plain ******ed.and you're just pulling that out of thin air (or, more likely, from a place where the sun don't shine). because nowhere, ever, did i say one should only be doing learning skills.in fact, there's a whole nuance to 'min-max'-ing learning skills that is, no doubt, entirely lost on you. for instance, it's not efficient to spend your entire 1.6 mil sp on learning skills exclusively. the extra gain you get from getting a learning skill to lv v, during the double-speed bonus time, does not outweigh having learnt a regular skill at double speed instead. also, for the advanced learning skills, getting them all to lv v on a single remap is inefficient too, as each of these advanced learning skills takes 'itself' as main attribute, as it were. for example, 'clarity', adding 1 additional point to your perception attribute per skill level, requires perception + willpower. likewise, 'presence', adding 1 additional point to your charisma attribute per skill level, requires charisma + perception; etc. so, getting these advanced skills to lv v is really best done the moment you do a favorable remap towards their individual attributes.instead of saying one should only be doing learning skills at first, i said: ""yet the very existence of the learning skills will cause any reasonably sensible person to gravitate towards doing the learning skills first."" and i chose ""gravitate towards"" with great care, as it's exactly so. sure, when i got my learning skills to around 3 or so, i trained some other stuff: a handful of support skills, some missile skills, and enough ship skills to fly my drake. but i nonetheless kept being drawn back to doing learning skills, as they simply are a priority for a newbie. i did not invent that system: i just saw it would benefit me.see, this is the thing you're uncomprehending on: learning skills are not the same as any other skill group; they are a 'meta' set: whatever you train with learning skills positively affects all other areas of your training. hence, they should get priority.yes, i'm sure they're much better off in your hands, being told learning is for nerdy, ocd-ing wimps, and that they should just go have fun, not worrying too much about their future, because it's just a game, after all. [/sarcasm]"
5/27/2010,nothing you say will be of any consequence as long as it is predicated on this silliness.also:please be trolling.
5/27/2010,"+1theres nothing deep or meaningfull to these learning skill. you have to level em, as early as possible. or else you simply miss out.giving the spend points back is needed though. someone mentioned correctly that a low level 6 mil point char will be gutt"
5/27/2010,"this guy has a right to complain about removing learning skills. the thread actually is for a plan to remove learning skills, but compensate people for them. so you will likely be better off with the change than without, because you would gain the attribute equivalent of max learning skills.it has nothing to do about ""wasting time"" or ""falling behind"" it simply is a time sink. people are basically stuck with a month of subscription time training skills to train skills. it is like sticking a required skill between frigate and cruiser that has no other purpose in the game but to allow you to train cruiser. sure, you don't have to train it... but you are going to restrict your capabilities pretty badly if you don't."
5/27/2010,"in all sincerity, i genuinely think you should stop playing mmos for a little while if you think that advice needs a /sacrcasm tag."
5/27/2010,incorrect.all skills are simply a time sink. and these ones actually reduce the size of the sink.
5/27/2010,this seems like a good idea. but why not just give people who have learning skills the sp to put where ever they want? whats with the 1000% increase in speed?the only potential drawback i see from this is that we may all be able to learn skills too fast. maybe only give everyone +7 accross the board and reimburse all the sp spent in learning.
5/27/2010,"i mean obviously we can't respect the choices people have made for their characters, right? that's out of the question."
5/27/2010,huh?
5/27/2010,"you and malcanis are probably the biggest failure *******s i've seen in eve recently. what, really, do you think that learning skills add to the game? the simple truth of the matter is that learning skills add nothing to the game except an unnecessary grind that prevents a large number of people from more fully enjoying the game. how can you deny the game would be better if people could just start training skills?also, there absolutely a race. first, you will ""race"" to get into a ship which you feel will be fun. second, you will ""race"" to get into situations which make more isk - such as doing l4 missions. third, you will ""race"" your friends to be able to do something. you will also notice people end up setting 'mileposts' that they want to accomplish, downloading evemon, and training a bunch of learning skills. the time spent training these learning skills is time that they could have used to become more proficient more quickly. they make the game unfriendly to new comers.the funny thing is that i'd love to see learning skills removed from the game purely for the sake of making the game more approachable. i don't even care if you credit my accounts with the sp in any way (and three of my five characters have significant learning investments).-liang"
5/27/2010,"not supported. learning skills are meant to be trained extensively when you're ready to train other skills extensively. ""catching up"" is impossible so don't even try. lastly, i understand excactly what other people are saying here about the ""unfunness"" factor people have. in eve we call it ""ship spinning"". it should be a sign that you need to go find something to do. you could train into a assault frigate with tech 2 guns before you even reach your 1.6 mil cutoff, so again i'm just not sure how you wouldn't have something to do while the skills are training.makes me wonder how many of you will want other skills dropped because you can't be bother to train them.also, this isn't a ""i had to do and so do you!"" post, its a ""go find something to do instead of watching your skill timer and stop sweating the small stuff"" post."
5/27/2010,"what do they add? variety? complexity? admittedly only a modicum of each, but apparently even that is too much. most importantly - choice? sure they add a timesink (there is no grind) - just like every other skill. although they are unique in that they actually reduce the timesink of other skills. and they take nothing away - because no matter how many times you say it, no-one is forced to train them, nor do they prevent anyone from doing anything.if you choose to use them in a way which makes getting to whatever it is you want slower, in the interest of long-term 'efficiency' - that's your choice. there is no race. not even if you put 'race' in quotes. your first and most asinine examples - ""racing"" into a ship and ""racing"" into a situation - are even missing a critical element of a race: who are you against? most people at least mistakenly assert that you are against the other players or some imaginary potential total sp. but, being an imaginary race, i suppose it doesn't really need an opponent?as for people who choose to race their friends, or set any other time-sensitive/skill-sensitive objective, once again that is their choice.see what i mean about them adding choice?if you choose to use them in a way which makes getting to your current objective faster, a request to remove them is just a whine about how long training takes. you can harp on about non-learning skills making you proficient as you go, but really, how does racial frigate ii make you more proficient with the tier iii frigate you still can't fly? how do half the support skills you need make you more proficient with a fit you can't fit yet? they don't. and let's not even get onto pre-reqs, where you have to 'become more proficient' in things you don't even want if the thing you do want is higher up the ladder.as you say yourself, most people break down their training into milestones - and no point between here and that milestone is of any interest, whether it is the completion of a learning skill or a non-learning skill.and if you really really just want immediate benefits and have no plan - you can choose not to train the learning skills, to fit them in some time when you are not concerned with what you are currently training.see what i mean about them adding choice?"
5/27/2010,"i wuoldnt mind if they just delete all learning skills, or at least advanced ones, and throw the sp invested in them away (and obviously increase attributes to compensate). learning skills are just terrible game design that does not add anything to the game."
5/27/2010,"if it is a choice, who has chosen to not train them? the choice is when they train them rather than if they train them. that isn't really a choice. i chose to not train mining. i don't suffer a penalty compared to others because of this. i can make isk in other ways, i can buy minerals, there are other things i can do. that is a choice."
5/27/2010,"contradiction. i believe you meant to say ""it is not a choice i like therefore it is not a choice"".you can't mine."
5/27/2010,"they were informed of this being an issue with players and ignored us.surely at the very least we should have tags/labels.think about it ccp if you had tags then you could make tagclouds.isn't that the kind of cool ""grow the social graph"" stuff you're looking for?you can't invite groups of people to events. there are no groups apart from standings/corp/alliance.pure fail."

5/27/2010,"introductionwhile pve is not everyone's playstyle, a lot of players still rely on pve as income source to fund other activities, whenether it is by grinding missions or running the same old 'exploration' sites over and over. ccp released not-so-epic mission arcs in their attempt to create exciting pve content, but these obviously do not solve the problem as they just add more static content. in 2009, ccp answered that ""players like the grind and don't want surprises"", which is a pretty stupid excuse for failing at creating interesting pve content.dynamic contentpve content should be dynamic and/or modular. missions and exploration sites should be generated from components randomly put together. spawns can be dynamic and unpredictable as well, with a 'budget' to select rats from to ensure players aren't dropped in the middle of 50 battleships.missions and exploration sites could have multiple acceleration gates leading to new pockets (similar to worlds collide), with players having to find their way to the objective. secondary, optional objectives should be included as well (similar to the extravaganza bonus room, or the secret meeting envoy etc).competetive missionsanother complaint is that missions are mostly solo content and that it scales into infinity, with agents offering unlimited missions to every pilot that visits them.instead, mini-events should occur in the game world, which spawn a hidden site. agents will drop clues to the existence of this site. however, multiple players will soon learn of this mini-event. players (or corporations) will have to compete with eachother to complete the objective first and claim the reward.if players do not complete the mini-event in a set timeframe, the event may escalate and worsen, and more players will be informed of the situation and called into action.an example of such a mission: the guristas are building a base in a remote low-sec system. some players are informed that something is up in that particular constellation, ships disappearing and so on. if the players manage to destroy the base, the threat is countered and succesful players rewarded. if nothing happens, then the base is completed. rats start appearing in the belts and on the gates. word arrives that the guristas have seized a caldari industrial full of military supplies, and hid it in a deadspace pocket in a nearby system to unload the goodies. players are urged to act quickly, destroy the guristas on-site and reclaim the empty industrial and fly it back to caldari navy base x. the corp/player that brings back the industrial gets a sizable reward. if the industrial gets destroyed, a small reward is granted to players on the killmail. if they fail doing either, the guristas base receives some annoying turret upgrades. and so on.less is morecurrently, rats lack proper fitting and intelligence and are generally just carry-bags full of loot. as a result, missions often rely on swamping the player with many weak rats. to make gameplay more interesting, ccp should consider having much fewer rats which use more realistic fittings and bring at least some degree of intelligence with them.realistic objectivesat the moment, kill-type missions/exploration sites are just that, shoot everything that moves. instead, pve objectives should rely on realistic mechanics such as scrambling a target to prevent it from warping off, or providing objectives where the player has to use webs or electronic warfare intelligently, or use piloting skill.useful linksdynamic events in guild wars 2it can't get more dynamic than dwarf fortressmissions under review (2008)dynamic missions (2009)"
5/27/2010,"as long as these can be probed out normally. also, rewards for helping out the guristas (from your example) would be pretty cool."
5/27/2010,"sounds generally good. one thing that i have long been keen to promote is a move away from the idea of pve scaling purely in more dps + more tank vs bigger rats with more dps and more tank.there should be missions that need probing skills, tackling skills, speed, stealth... more than just ""i have a x-type xl booster so i win"".and the rats should be much less predictable, properly fitted and far fewer in number. killing a bs class rat should be a significant challenge.in short: fighting npcs should be a lot more like fighting pcs. the benefits of this would be multiple1 - much harder to macro/farm2 - missioners would be much better able in both skills and equipment to deal with other players.3 - pveing would be much more exciting and fun. as you say, it is simply inexcusable for eve to have such poor pvp. the only players that like missions being dull, predictable and repetitive are the isk farmers.can you incorporate these concepts in to your proposal?"
5/27/2010,"was a bit short on characters but got your suggestions in there, i think."
5/27/2010,i had a similar idea but you have said it much better -t'amber
5/27/2010,anything that livens up the isk farm is a good idea
5/27/2010,"while i agree with most of your suggestion, ""competitive missions"" has a problem: who will be informed? how he/she will be chosen?any system you implement will benefit someone more and some less and run the risk of people claiming that someone get a preferential treatment. /support for the general idea."
5/27/2010,"i supported this when i proposed it (albeit much less artfully) two years ago. i support it now.eve's backstory has lots of opportunity for a dynamically evolving npc system that can be directly influenced (and profited from) by player activities, and in the long run, it's cheaper than human-led events.heh - ""players like the grind and don't want surprises"" - correction, ccp - mmo ex-wow addicts don't know anything other than the grind, and suffer from conditioning to it. those that don't aren't playing current grindy pve mmos. gw2 would not be doing what they are doing if they didn't think there was a market.it'll be interesting (even just at the pure technical level) to see where gw2 goes with the concept anyway.a good concept to throw around and develop on."
5/27/2010,agreed!i like all of this but missions scaled to the gang/fleet size when accepting the mission would be a nice challenge as well if you are going to integrate dynamic spawns this could be added as well.
5/27/2010,definitely a step into the right direction (even if a lot of it sounds like the public quests in w:aor or what has been proposed more recently for gw2). but: might you consider implementing this?dynamic mission quality- spawn more rewarding missions the less missions are taken and completed in a certain system/constellation (and vice versa)
5/27/2010,"first of all, i apologize if this is a repeat topic, however i saw nothing in the list of existing csm issues that matched this.my proposal relates to launching jobs remotely into player owned pos labs and assembly arrays. currently this can be done only if the blueprint in question is based in a corp hangar at an npc station in the same system as the tower with the labs/arrays.i would like to propose the following additions to this system:a) blueprints based in the storage of a mobile laboratory or assembly array can be used to install a job into a slot of that array/lab only.b) blueprints based in a corporate hangar array can be used to install a job into a slot of any lab or array anchored at the same pos.c) research jobs that produce an output (copying/invention) can have their output directed into the storage of either the lab the job was installed in, or a corporate hangar based at the same pos as the lab.the current system as it stands has several shortcomings:1) the requirement for a corp to rent office space in a system for no other reason than to permit remote research. this is an additional (and imo unnecessary) cost thrown on top of the expense of buying and fueling the pos and arrays.2) hisec systems that contain no npc stations (such as ahtulaima in the forge) are a wasted oppurtunity for research pos's. yes you can set up a tower and labs, but you will have to physically be at the tower every time you want to install new research jobs.3) the need to constantly shuttle research products from tower back to station hangar breaks the production continuity and makes ""remote research"" not really that remote. here is an example involving tech ii invention and manufacturing:-i have a pos in system x with 1 mobile laboratory and one equipment assembly array anchored and online. -i have done my homework in advance and loaded the lab and the assembly array with all the required datacores, data sheets (if required) and manufacturing materials for my intended end product.-i have a t1 bpo for item y based in an npc station corp hangar.-i am physically located in system z, 5 jumps away, where i like to run missions.-i install a copy job remotely from system z using the bpo into the pos lab, it produces 20 copies. when the job is completed and delivered the produced copies are deposited into the specified output tab of the labs storage.-i must now fly from system z to system x just to remove the copies from the lab and place them in the npc station corp hangar. once done, i return to my mission running home.-i remotely install several batches of invention jobs using the 20 bpcs into the pos lab. those jobs that are successful, are again delivered into the lab storage.-i must now fly once again from z back to x just to move the tech ii bpc's from lab into station hangar. after, i again return to system z.-i can now remotely install manufacturing jobs using the t2 bpcs into the pos assembly array. when completed, the products are delivered into the assembly arrays storage. i return to x for a third time, collect my product, and profit.not very fluid is it? and with the proposed development of eve gate one day becoming a tool for research/manufacturing management, it needs to change. installing jobs form a web browser certainly seems feasible (and cool, i love the future intent of eve gate) but you're certainly not going to be able to fly your bpc's back and forth through a web browser....continued in next post..."
5/27/2010,"...cont...so having just covered the above real world example of how things currently are, let's go through a theoretical example of how the system should work:-as before, i have my tower, lab and assembly array. i have done my homework and everything is stocked correctly. only this time i have flipped the bird to the npc station lords and kept my 40 million per month in rental fees. i've already paid for and fueled my own interweb spacestation, why would i pay more to someone else to use theirs? -again i am living several jumps away.-""item y"" t1 bpo is based in a corp hangar array anchored and online at the pos.-i remotely install my copy job from the pos corp hangar array into the pos lab.-when the job completes, the produced copies are output not into the lab's storage, but back into the pos corp hangar array.-i remotely install invention jobs using the t1 bpcs from hangar array to lab. again the jobs output (t2 copies) goes back into the corp hangar array.-i remotely install manufacturing jobs using the t2 bpcs from corp hangar array into the pos assembly array. when these jobs complete, they output either into the arrays storage or into the corp hangar array.-when this whole chain of production has run its course, which may have taken 2 days, 2 weeks or 2 months, i make one single trip to system x to collect and sell my product, and restock the lab/factory for the next months work. apart from this one restock-and-profit trip, i have not had to leave my ""home"" system several jumps away.to me, and i would hope to many of my industrialist colleagues, this scenario is the proper definition of ""remote research"", and is what i would like to see made possible by having this proposal implemented. to anyone who is not familiar with remote jobs, or thinks this is currently possible, it's not, try it. place a blueprint into a lab hangar at a pos and fly to the neighboring system. open your si interface and select the corp blueprints tab. a list appears of your corps station offices, but nowhere is the pos lab blueprint visible. you'd certainly think it would be, it's in corp storage, it is therefore corp property. yet you cannot manage it in the si interface unless you are actually floating next to the lab in question.so i think that fleshes out my issue pretty well. if you've read this far you're likely already an inductry fan yourself, so i'm going to add a few other common requests on in support of them:-personal pos:please create a ""launch for self"" option when anchoring pos's in conjunction to the existing ""launch for corp"" option. anchoring in this way would mean the standings requirement to anchor would be based off the individuals faction standings, not the corps, and the facilities anchored there would be usable only by the individual. why have a ""personal"" filter in the installations tab of the si interface anyway, if there's no such thing as a personal lab/factory?why? because you're a member of a large 100 member space-opera war-waging corp with ~0.0 standings with every faction, but you also want a hisec research pos of your own. currently you either have to quit your corp (which you love) and go solo, or beg permission from your corp directors to anchor your 1b worth of pos equipment in lowsec for you, where it will quickly explode.-batch install research/manufacturing jobs:i know i'm not alone here. i do invention, a lot of invention. when at work i'm sneaking on every couple of hours to install ten new jobs. doing each job one by one is ""click intensive"" and extremely tedious. please allow us to shift-select a group of installation slots and install blueprints into all of them in one go. you're responsible for my organizations loss of man hours ccp! -ability to hack and then unanchor offline pos towers:this one's old as the hills. come one, let us clear up that real estate already that's all from me folks, thanks for reading and fly safe! o/"

5/27/2010,"introductionduring the past two years, the csm has raised dozens of minor ui fixes. while a small handful of these issues have been implemented in-game, it remains obvious that the eve ui is fundamentally flawed. ccp has stated that they intend to revamp the ui at some point, but as we have seen the past years, they never get further than band-aid fixes. rather than raising another dozen specific ui issues which will either get ignored or are just band-aids, i would like to ask ccp to just revamp the whole ui once and for all.why commit resources?* the ui is one of the major turnoff points of the game from the perspective of new users.* improving the ui positively impacts all playstyles and all areas of the game.* much less subsequent resources required to make changes and additions.* ui improvments will render certain existing content in eve more accessible (science, industry, pos management, etc). a lot of players do not bother with this content due to a needlessly complex ui.* the current ui gives eve a very dated and inaccessible appearance.what is needed?* more context-sensitive one-click buttons to replace the drop-down menus.* modular functionality so players can customize their ui. edit: this is not moddable ui, so no third party add-ons.* clipboard-like lists where players can put links (solar systems, bookmarks, locations, people, items) so they don't need to have lots of windows open at the same time to access these.* no needless functionality duplication (example, having a reset camera function in the rightclick menu when selecting your ship, when there is a one-click button in the main interface doing the same).* means to tell items apart (bpo from bpc, meta levels, faction/officer modules, type of item)* a readable font, which scales properly.* better hotkey support.feedback please!please provide general ui improvements you believe should be included. arguments to convince ccp to commit to a ui revamp are particularly welcome."
5/27/2010,"sorry, not supported. in my opinion too much work for too little reward.some of your other proposals are more important.1) fix factional warfare2) address lag. we all know it is technically impossible for the system to scale up smoothly, ultimately there needs to be a mechanism by which having many ships in the same system is either actively prevented, or somehow discouraged via some other mechanism like weakened sensors"
5/27/2010,"too little reward? are you serious? this is why nothing gets done because of comments like this...the ui is outdated and does need a change, but yeah it is a bit of work. but so what....if not then allow the ui to be modded then ccp dont have to revamp the ui."
5/27/2010,"ccp cant make a ui, allow player modification please.but yeah a good ui needs less drop down menus, and with the menus you keep only show on default the most used ones, most of the right click options are never or barely used and clutter the important ones. and when busy also remove the ones that cannot even be used, like renaming ships you arent in, bookmarking stuff on directional scanner, etc."

5/27/2010,"obviously i support ui reform, though i disagree with t'amber about the mods (but not about making sure they can't be abused)."
5/27/2010,"the ideal would be a moddable ui. i know ccp has already said no, but push them for it anyways(informally). it would, bar none, be the single best change to eve that could be made. failing that, do what you can to get them to improve it. large amounts of data always devolve into spreadsheet form sooner or later, but there are spreadsheets and there are spreadsheets. also, some of the little things that are just appallingly bad - eve's text chat, for example, makes me pine for the yahoo messenger client i had in 1997. they're working through these - the new mail client is actually pretty good, and the new igb is at least somewhat usable - but there's still a lot that need work."
5/27/2010,"supporting this, but you should also push for a moddable ui.-liang"

5/27/2010,"considering ccp completely sucks noodles every time they touch the ui the general ""ui revamp"" proposal is not supported. seriously, 1 out of 20 things they do with the ui is actually good, and it's never their own idea. the reason it needs to be revamped is because they flunked their interface usability classes in college. who's to say they'll make it any better instead of completely breaking the functionality that's still there? the only thing i would support is letting it be completely customizable so people can make it not suck on their own. problem with customization is easier macro access, which is another problem ccp fails at dealing with."

5/27/2010,"supported fully.thank you,"
5/27/2010,anki like allot of what you propose but some i don't. its hard to tell what i would be supporting if i supported this. under short term improvements i agree with everything except how exactly do you intend to promote pvp in complexes and missions? i think we can promote pvp in complexes by removing npcs and simply letting the players know when and where a complex is being run. is that what you mean to do? but missions? not sure how you get the pve to pvp there. i think missions are fine the way they are. they can currently be used by players for great pvp and are being used that way to some extent. but i agree that can be improved. for example i sometimes take a level 1 mission in the opposing factions main system. since level 1s only allow frigates or destroyers in i can kill most of the rats and wait for enemies to come in. i know they cant all warp on top of my t1 frigate because they must go through the gate. they will know what ships i am in based on the scanner. i hope to do this with some level 3 missions and a group of bcs. i think it will lead to some good pvp. i hope ccp doesnt mess with missions and make this impossible. but without knowing what you propose how can we tell? under mid term: i also tend to agree but not sure exaclty how you want to let alliances in. you had made a proposal on this before that i thought were pretty good (if memory serves) but i have also seen several proposals that were bad. as far as long term goals. i used to want occupancy consequences now i'm against it. we dont need more people piling on the winning side. (which this would encourage) we need the opposite. the rest is a bit too vague. live events like a fw tournament similar to the alliance tournament would be great though. the way this proposal is written it seems like some sort of carte blanche to have csm do whatever in fw. i tend to like fw as it is now and would not be in favor of the csm proposing changes unless we first have a somewhat detailed proposal that we can actually discuss.fix faction war is not really a proposal. if i recall you had some decent detailed proposals please give them to us individually so we can know what we are supporting.

5/27/2010,^ this i especially would like to see but all are good points
5/27/2010,omg yes please
5/27/2010,"when you say as far as specifics go, *this* has been debated to death what are you referring to? the specifics as to what issue? i have been following these threads quite a bit and we generally get 3 types of ideas:1) very vague threads where someone says ""fix faction war"" and everyone agrees. but the ideas they post on how to ""fix"" it are various and often contradictory. i mean why not have a thread that says ""fix eve"" and then if anyone wants anything in eve changed then support the idea. you end up getting allot of people saying yeah i want this change but at the end of the day you have no idea what change people are really supporting. that is what this thread is. 2) threads that involve correcting exploits or quasi exploits or bugs. i would also throw in there things like obvious imbalances between races. e.g., there is no good reason the caldari npcs should be 10s more difficult to fight than the gallente. these proposals are specific and usually well supported.3) then there are the other detailed proposals. these would include things like mechanics to allow alliances to be able to join; add certain consequences for occupancy; add back the automatic decline for missions; change the mechanics of how the complexes spawn and occupancy ; remove all npcs from plexes; change how lp are awarded; etc etc. these proposals have met with widely varied support by the players. some were strongly supported some were mostly rejected.we cant expect ccp will just redo fw based on vague ideas. its fairly popular as it is. i still think they could add some things to help fw players earn more money and of course i have a few other ideas. but each of these ideas needs to be considered on its own merit by the players. at least, if you want the csm to do things that the players want as opposed to whatever they see fit."

5/27/2010,couldn't agree more !
5/27/2010,"well, it's kinda late for that - it already launched, but better late than never. it's not like every newbie gets a message ""hey, that person you're about to set to +10 will be able to see all your contacts on eve-gate!"" - it is a part of the game (according to ccp devs), right? so game can tell that your setting is default, riiight? ah, whatever... they're hopless."
5/27/2010,"100% fully supported.you guys have heard of the fuss mark z has found himself in over on fb, haven't you?zallende."
5/27/2010,csm is nothing but a pr stunt that let ccp claim to be listening. but i'll support this if it fixes this privacy glitch.
5/27/2010,.
5/27/2010,no brainer. ccp is ******ed for using open privacy settings.
5/27/2010,100% supported. exposure of potentially strategic info by default is an appallingly bad idea.
5/27/2010,"i too agree that the default should be ""none""."
5/27/2010,"there is already mechanics in place for this you can request the escalation of your issue to a higher ranking gm. i have asked for escalation once because i thought the first answer i received was not sufficient. i had an update in a day from another senior gm and they discussed with me the issue and came to the same conclusion. i do agree that a gm should not handle a ticket about himself ever. i do however question what you requested. i find that it is a valid question and information we should be made privy too least we get caught up in this whirlwind of emotion to hang ccp. i have filed many things with ccp in my time here in the game. some i felt did not make sense or that i simply did not agree with. each time i tried my damnedest and coolest to prevail. in some cases i was successful in others i was not and in those rare occasion just joking around when exposing a flaw in a billing system or a bug gets one rewarded. i have found ccp fair and just. they have rules in place and an eula that guides the service they offer with rules for our side. as a note when i was a much younger player i bought isk, i was punished oah man was i punished. a negative 1 billions wallet was horrible and took a long time to repair. i think i worked on that for a good 6 months my god was it horrible. but i did something i had fair warning about. i thought i could sneak it in but they got me. to this day i am glad they did only that when they could have been much harsher."
5/27/2010,also won't hurt to add number for meta level on item icons to make this even easier.

5/27/2010,"/signed /signed and more /signedwhen i first saw the trailers for dust i was ecstatic! (being a relic from the bygone age of planetside, and wanting something more meaningful than 2142.)then i saw it was console only... i was both confused and ****ed. that's on par with sony deciding to announce that they're making a sequel to planetside... console only!i don't begrudge ccp the opportunity to make money on all the console kids, but for those of us already involved in eve, i have to agree with earlier posters (in both threads) that shelling out for xbl, isp, eve, and possibly dust (don't know if an 'mmo' sub would be rolled into xbl), especially during a global recession, is just plain silly. (or unrealisticly greedy.)also, i agree with many that have stated that this decision is very much a slap in the face to the existing eve playerbase. i'm all for expanding the accessibility of the games and the setting, but ostracizing your existing fanbase for the chance to make an extra buck from microsoft on a platform specific release is a surprisingly dense marketing decision. simply put:give us cross platform.speaking not only for myself but a group of 8 (some eve players, some not) that i game with on a regular basis.if you release on pc we will all purchase.if you do not release on pc none of us will purchase.i say this not out of a desire to be ornery, but simply as a statement of fact."
5/27/2010,"if you have ever used the ingame eve map and tried to plot a route with it, you may have noticed that the flattened map looks terrible.ccp, make the flattened map look something like this"
5/27/2010,i prefer spaghetti tbo
5/27/2010,flattened map is just that - flattened 3d map which shows the stars where they are but with no z-axiswollari's map totally lacks the information on star relative positions in favor of readability
5/27/2010,"star relative positions is generally worthless info on the flattened map. if you are in a capital trying to figure out if you can jump to a star, you need to use 3d mode anyways. or eve jump plannerif you are in a roaming gang and you want to look in the nooks and crannies of the eve star systems have fun with that.using a 3rd party site just to figure out where i want to go sucks"
5/27/2010,the current map really isn't all that hard to read imo. i don't think the time to change it is worth the reward. also i prefer the current one for rp sake. id like to keep a little bit of the feeling that i'm actually in space rather then looking at another spreadsheet.
5/27/2010,"supported, if and only if they implement a proper ruler on the map. it can be star colouring and a text box where you input a number of ly, but it should be graphical, and it should be accessible without needing to be physically inside a jump-capable ship at the time.that said, minor issue. wiollari, ombey, and serenity have already done a pretty fair job of this, players can work from there."
5/27/2010,"yeah, but the problem with their maps is that you cant right click and set destination to the systems in there, and you have to tab out"
5/27/2010,"in-game browser? also, using the search function in people and places works better than right clicking in the map. search for your first waypoint, add waypoint. search for second, add second, etc."
5/27/2010,dude how hard is it to learn what your looking at. is it really that hard to read the lines.. and figure out what color lines mean what.. or hers is an idea.. use the f11 map to look at constilation info.. or right click a spot near you and do select constilation or region figure out the area as all the lines will connect and you can see what your looking at as well as read map data.. the pdf maps and such are great for what they are but all in all they are not that needed and without the current map data they are worthless when your loking to plan arotue or last but not least.. learn were you fly.. i mean my god the time it would take to figure out a few things about were your roam'n / hunting.. so some home work . the map has been pretty much the same sense beta and its worked just fine thus far.. why do you think it should change becuase it has fetures you lack the understanding in learning how to use...as with most forum cry's do some home work or ask for help.. people are so quick to ask for change before they take th time to learn or ask hwo to do something everyone else seems to be able to do just fine.. if everyone else can do it and not you maybe th eproblem is you??? good old mirror take a look you might notice something familar..
5/27/2010,"it is terrible, but it's not so much about the looks, it mostly about having hard time selecting solar system you need out of two systems that are few pixels away from each other (because of ""feature"" of previosly selected solar system staying in focus if you move cursor away - that results in pixelhunting most quests would envy)."
5/27/2010,what we need is a 3-d map that can be freely rotated (as it used to be years ago) so the flattened map is once again redundant.making the flattened map change star locations any more than it already does would make it impossible to find my way around on it.
5/27/2010,"i agree with maz, i find it incredible that anyone uses the ingame map to find their way around in its current implementation."
5/27/2010,"yes this is the reason its terrible. the criss crossing lines arent a big deal, but if a line happens to go over a star(but not connect to), and when stars overlap with landmarks or other stars is the problem. i don't necessarily mean that ccp should turn the eve map to look like something out of a spreadsheet(i think it should remain in the same art style)- but something where the connections to the stars make more visual sense would be great. i want to be able to look at the flattened map and see ""oh there, is a deadend constellation"" and ""oh there, is another route to the same place""."
5/27/2010,"the map looks a lot like the ombeve 2d maps, which i've found to be just a confusing as the ingame map. not supported, although i do understand your frustrations using a 3rd party website to determine locations. 3rd party stuff always makes me tense, i'm always just waiting to log in an find my account hacked with all my junk gone. however, for immersions sake (big deal for me personally) i'd prefer something that looks a little more high tech.so. . .not supported until maps looks more awesome and keeps the immersion going.+1 for the spaghetti pic though"

5/27/2010,a no-brainer.
5/27/2010,"smashing idea, and while at it allow for a list type view without the portrait icons .. needless waste of bandwidth/space if you ask me so want to be able to remove them."
5/27/2010,"one of the frequently stated intentions is to spread out players in high security space, and prevent large clusters of mission-runners to occupy a system.unfortunately, ccp's approach has been to add more agents for overused corps/factions. this gives these corporations an advantage over others, causing more players to flock to systems with agents beloning to these factions.in my opinion, the correct approach to this problem is to make other corporations more attractive for mission running and balancing the agent distribution between the factions.this can be done in several ways:* bringing agent quantity and type inline between the big four: caldari currently has an absurd advantage over the other factions due to the overabundance of good combat agents.* adding agents for factions which are not the big four: sisters of eve, khanid kingdom, ammatar mandate, interbus.* changing the standing matrix to make factions such as thukker tribe and intaki syndicate more attractive.* adding more (lp shop) incentives to run missions for lowsec/0.0 factions such as ore, mordus legion, intaki syndicate.* rebalancing mission hubs, players should have to choose between either a single high-quality agent or multiple low-quality agents, not both."
5/27/2010,"your ideas aren't bad in themselves, in fact i quite like them. but they're putting lipstick on a pig: the fact that the missions themselves are utterly predictable, boring, virtually all the same and one-dimensional."
5/27/2010,"missions would at least be alot better with sleeper ais and some randomness.i would like to see dynamic agent quality (does not need to be fully dynamic, but partially at least), so one agent can be q10, but when used alot it drops to q0, while the other is q-5, but when used barely it increases to q5. serious it cannot be that hard to implement that and that would really help spreading mission runners.and when busy upgrade quality of all lvl 4 agents in low sec to at least zero (if possible while keeping their old standing requirements, but that is probably not possible), it is ridiculous that if you want to do lvl 4 missions in low sec there are plenty of q-17 agents."
5/27/2010,i was getting to that.
5/27/2010,"supported.think one potential fix to help spread out mission runners would be a complete overhaul of the lp store system.at the moment, there's a lot of duplication between the lp stores for corporations in the same faction meaning that there's not as much point running missions for those smaller corporations as the items you can get there, you can also get from, for example, the factional navy lp store as well as a lot of other items that you can't get at the smaller corp stores.so, to make it more worthwhile to run missions for the smaller corps, there needs to be a lot more unique offers. if i wanted to get a hold of an ""hardwiring - eifyr and co. 'gunslinger' ax-2"", for example, i should need to be running missions for eifyr and co to get a hold of one (or be willing to pay someone who runs missions for that corp to get one for me). alternatively, it should be more expensive, in lp and isk, to get a hold of lp store items from corporations other than the one who produces it making it more worthwhile to go to the manufacturer if you're looking for something specific.-----tl;dr - make the lp stores less generic."
5/27/2010,"yeah, i've been saying this for a while. that said, one buff caldari needs when it comes to missions - can we get some cn l4 q20 agents in lowsec like the other empires have? i know they don't see a lot of use, but they should exist."
5/27/2010,agreed!i also support missions receiving sleeper ai and lp store diversity.
5/27/2010,it would be nice if the agents did some traveling once in a while to some of their other corp stations too.
5/27/2010,"spreading missioners out will nerf ninja-salvaging, but otherwise you have good ideas. lowsec needs some love and missions are quite boring. your idea of dynamic missions is pretty new and would make ninja-salvaging more challenging."
5/27/2010,"looks good, although i'd like to see some sort of dynamic agent quality and available mission balancing. ie, the amount of players utalising an agent reflects on the amount of overall available missions and the quality of the agent (although there would still be base qualities to work at).this idea would help some server balancing, but it may have an adverse effect on some mini professions and possibly raise item prices for regions.-t'amber"
5/27/2010,"this way i can provide some tackle support.retribution currently has 1 med slot.all other af's could use one extra med or low slot as well. this is really not asking for much, just to make them pvp viable.edit: move the 5th high slot to the new med spot."
5/27/2010,"if i had to buff the retribution, i'd give it a fifth turret, not a second mid. not every ship needs to work solo."
5/27/2010,i have yet to find a corp that would allow me to fly this ship due to the lack of a second mid slot.
5/27/2010,"it has nothing to do with solo, it has everything to do with not being useless. if you only have one rifter as a tackler in your fleet and that rifter dies, your fleet is rather useless that is why you need as many points as possible. most pvp fits fit a point, even bs and bc ships because you never know when you'll be the only one in position to tackle a juicy target.common scenarios in pvp are bouncing a target between two gates, belt bombing a system and tackling multiple targets (if you have multiple targets you want to point as many as possible right?) i'm sure many people fly retributions and love them. i'm also sure that the people in your fleet make fun of you and ask you when you are training for a real ship."
5/27/2010,"in the previous expansion, dominion, 0.0 received an overhaul. i think it is a good idea to discuss the current state of 0.0 with ccp and see if dominion accomplished its intended goals.in particular, i believe the following issues are worthy of discussion:* barrier to entry. new and independent alliances find it near-impossible to take and hold sov.* (super)cap blobbing. what role should there be for smaller gangs?* incentives to make players actually live in 0.0 space.* no real empire-building, means to develop space is very limited and expensive.* mega-alliances still holding too much space?please provide your views on these issues, or bring up issues you see as a problem in 0.0. this post will be updated to incorporate your feedback."
5/27/2010,"dominion feature called ""lag"" kinda fixed that: now you need less people to lag the hell out of the system"
5/27/2010,"* barrier to entry. new and independent alliances find it near-impossible to take and hold sov.this is where renter alliances are actually awesome (despite all the hate). they allow corps to get out into 0.0 without having a field large cap fleets. once you're there you can build up your strength, make the contacts you need and get in a position where you can take space and keep it.* (super)cap blobbing. what role should there be for smaller gangs?see providence. end of the day though there's plenty of room for small gangs anyway. if you're roaming in a small gang and getting blobbed by caps you're doing it wrong.* incentives to make players actually live in 0.0 space.you mean apart from the huge piles of isk we can make post dominion? :lol* no real empire-building, means to develop space is very limited and expensive.huh? you can build empires just fine, you just need to have enough people making use of the systems you're claiming. the old pre-dominion thing of vast swathes of empty sov space was ****ed anyway.* mega-alliances still holding too much space?yes but the renter alliance thing has actually had some pretty good benefits. the main concern now is just that the big alliances are building up isk reserves that may make them untouchable in future to anyone but the existing rivals. how could an alliance coming through now ever get hold of the r64's and space to ever take on the titans and supercap fleets of the big guys? eve needs a top level money sink that doesn't provide the top alliances with more combat power. something vanity based would probably work."
5/27/2010,"about the amount you make with lvl 4 missions in high sec? and then only when you are in an afk wasteland alliance, not if in one of the few places that are actually populated like ccp wanted.only will change if the large alliances get a reason not to steamroll them. good fights apparently isnt enough of a reason, it would help if travel took longer, so they dont want to bring all their bffs from across the universe to smash one small alliance since that would leave them vulnerable. while now you can cross the universe in around 20 minutes.i like the idea proposed earlier that it becomes harder to take a system with higher development indexes. although in the end many probably still rather just drop a super cap fleet on it.more reward, more abilities to deal with the risks. (gonna get flamed for this, but yeah i am looking at afk cloaking).on the reward subject, npc 0.0 does not benefit from dominion yet, but for starters it would already be nice if way more of the anomalies would be havens and sanctums.more upgrade posibilities.related to 1-2."
5/27/2010,"you can make enormous amounts of isk in 0.0 if you set your corp up the right way. a system with pirates 5 has a near constant supply of havens and sanctums and entrapments 5 gives you awesome plex's on top. one system can keep a group busy, and the mining upgrades give you access to the best ores. seriously, there's very little excuse for people not raking in cash in 0.0. incidentally i agree with you about the need to nerf cloaks. currently a cloaker can be an invulnerable intel source for enemies. that's not on. everything in the game should have a possible counter move, even if it requires a lot of time and work to do it."
5/27/2010,"this is not entirely true. the crippler is ""on grid"" - there have been nearly 1,500 people engaged in hostilities in a system post-dominion. they had multiple locations with ongoing fights... until everyone got sucked into a fight on the same grid and the node killed its hamsters in frustration.the problem remains that passive (moon) income, which makes up much of the income for a 0.0 alliance and is spread out. this, rather than allowing others access, leads larger alliances to hold a moon here and there and allow ""friendly"" alliances to hold the space around their moons (to slow down an invasion long enough for them to assemble). i think the best solution is to directly tie alliance income to the income of the members. allow alliances to tax. this shifts the income source (most alliances have ""per member"" taxes and such already in place) to other infrastructure that they have more control over than the moons they hold.this or some variation of it.there aren't enough already? the barrier is a learning curve (wall) like many other things in eve. in this case, developing connections that allow you to join an existing alliance or get set blue to other alliances out there. it isn't exactly a good 'ole buddy club, because alliances in 0.0 constantly have a need for more manpower.the entire game is designed around trying to make it difficult to go it alone, forcing players to work together. it is an mmo after all.the problem is mainly that alliance have little reason to develop their space other than to pacify or attract members. tie alliance income to infrastructure.mega-alliances? do you mean coalitions or are you simply talking about the most well known alliances in the game? again, the space being held is not the issue, they hold space to hold moons. alliances need a source of income equal to or greater than their moons before they will focus on something other than grab more moon gold. the domino effect from this will break apart nap-trains as they no longer need them as much to protect their far-flung moons."
5/27/2010,"fypseriously, find a way to nerf the nap trains. 0.0 should have at least a dozen or more separate conflicts going on at once. not this team a vs. team b **** that we all see right now."
5/27/2010,shouldn't this be in features and ideas?
5/27/2010,i also think that is a good idea
5/27/2010,"you just need to fix the lag, first of all. worry about everything else once this is done."
5/27/2010,^^^^while this issue is obviously important this probably isn't the place to start it.t'amber
5/27/2010,let's see how much the cap/supercap insurance nerf fixes this.
5/27/2010,"the only real barrier to entry is not being willing to fit a ship and jump through a gate...some alliances that work around small gangs are still doing quite nicely, tyvmdo you live in a cave or are you that far removed from whats actually going on in the game?well, we've seen how well thats worked for mega-alliances such as ~goonswarm~"
5/27/2010,"that's a player problem, not a developer problem. it's our fault, not ccp's."
5/27/2010,"planets are currently seeded randomly (according to some arcane algorythm) as are their properties. while this promises ""realistic"" placement of unique planets, the algorythm seems to be broken. as it is, you will find 300k oceanic planets at 15au far outside the orbit of gas and ice planets in the same system (in attyn, just to name one example) and temperate planets with oceans at less than 100k or more than 8g of gravity. this clearly needs to be fixed eventually if we have any interest in a universe that keeps up some illusion of ""realism"" (this is science fiction, after all).however, time is getting short to address this since players will start deploying planetary structures in a couple weeks and changing or moving planets about thereafter will likely cause enormous problems.i had hoped this would have already been addressed with the tyrannis upgrade, as i believe i read a dev stating they had hired an astrophysicist to come up with realistic planet data. i seem to have misunderstood.this is probably a minority issue that will not find impressive support but maybe one of the new csm members will pick it up seeing that it makes some sense..."

5/27/2010,i appears that jita has been limited to 1000 ships. this has created a massacre at the gates. ships are being ganked by pirates because they cant jump the gate. this attempt to limit players into jita will ruin jita as a trading hub. a lot of players economy revolves arround this hub.
5/27/2010,hint: dont use perimeter or sobaseki to go to jita.there is a highway around jita so you can do 1-2 jumps more and find systems with totally empty gates towards jita.and the pirates cant be everywhere.last but not least ... the limit is now 1300 people. iircthough there is nothing that needs to be changed.
5/27/2010,haha this game is so great.
5/27/2010,"oh no, people might need to find somewhere else to trade. the horror!you go to jita, and then get surprised when you eat a gank? really?"

5/27/2010,"i would like ccp to give players more tools to do this themselves. i don't like the idea of ccp being involved in this. so if you wanted to buy a ""space arena"" you could. they could also buy sentry guns to attack unruly audience members who enter the arena unauthorized. but if the neutrals tank the sentry guns well... thats eve.it would be nice if the players had their own types of tournaments and didn't have to rely on ccp to come up with them. i think the idea of an arena is too barbaric for high sec so they should only be in low sec or null sec. they should also cost allot of isk - a new thing for industrialists to build. corps could get a good reputation for holding professional tournaments in their arenas and start asking admission fees. it could be another business avenue. the arenas could have varying sizes and they could have timers or what have you. the cost of sentry guns would have to be quite large. so you would have to pay a ___ ton of money if you wanted a really secure arena. the arena itself would really just be like a balloon force field that indicated if someone went ""out of bounds"" it would be great if bets could also be accounted for."
5/27/2010,"i am in low sec, i want to be immune to danger. i get a friend, duel him, we both happily sit there, because by op's proposal we can't be attacked.no."
5/27/2010,"no.you can do this by can flagging. actual risk of getting it dishonoured existing is fine and good. a instanced arena would not teach anyone anything about pvp, it would instead teach people how to fly pimped gay fits which they'd never do in real tq pvp.the idiocy has been brought up many times before, and has always gotten the same answer (gtfo).sisi exists if you want riskless duels w/out interference."
5/27/2010,i'm glad i'm doing pve for a while because this would bother me. change supported
5/27/2010,i support your doing pve!
5/27/2010,"don't really know why this was nerfed, tbh. the wide screen is superior to the standard for pvp, i would like it back. as an option.edit: removed because of issues with new cameras. can we look into fixing those issues?"
5/27/2010,"i've been wondering if it is at all possible to do. i'd imagine one could, as one can already use an api to view it's content. what i want is the ability to fit stuff from containers. more specificly station containers/vaults. i have for some time now had the maximum numbers of items allowed in a single station (928 separate stacks or something like that). basicly it got to the point where it started to take a very long time to open my ""items"". i did a petition to see if the problem was the number of stacks, or just the number of total items (thousands of items/stack). i did a petition, and i'll throw in some of the messages here:after this i got told to try and manually clear all caches in each seperate folder that a gm linked me. this didn't do anything, so i sent this:i then got asked in what stations this happened, to wich i said it only happens in my primary station (i only have about half as much is secondary stations).this is then the advice i got: so after this i divided stacks into containers, with main focus on drones, ammo, salvage, faction etc. now, while this works fine (with roughly 450 separate stacks and roughly 20k separate items still unsorted) it's still a bit slow to open and a mess to use when fitting ships.i've had more items than this without having any load delay before, so i'm wondering if it's something that happened somewhere in dominion. this put aside (it's just a bit anoying, not gamebreaking so i'm not gonna whine i have to wait) i'd like the ability to fit a ship using the very nice fitting screen you gave us ccp , but to do so without having to move items out of station containers.as i said initially i'm not even sure if this is possible, but if it is i would absolutely love it. this would be beneficial for those that fit ships for the corp/alliance aswell, as they could simply just move cans with stuff into a station, and get ships traded and hit fit.an even more advanced feature would be to select which cans the fitting option would draw items for, but that is just wishful thinking at best.so i'm just putting this out there. i don't see how this could be negative in any way, but how it would be benefit the players and the game. i can only presume that having people stack items in cans will reduce server load, as you only have to query so many items at any given time."
5/27/2010,"*5 minute post delay ftw*now, this of course leaves us with the question ""how am i going to find stuff that's in cans from a remote location?"". as is, the only way ccp let us do that in game (afaik) is to do a contract, at which point it lists everything inside the can. however, there are tools that make use of our api's in such a way that one can see the content of your containers even out of game, so i'm a bit fuzzed as to why ccp won't let us do this in game. enable this maybe?in any case, i'll leave this for debate. i'll say again that i don't see how this would harm anything, only benefit the game, players and the servers. but that's just a mad mans talk.halsoy"
5/27/2010,would love for fitting from cans to be implemented as well as being able to remotely view cans (if the api can do it why can't the client!)have wanted this for a while but been to lazy to write up something for it :)
5/27/2010,this.
5/27/2010,you got podded in 1.0 space after saying it was impossable... your opinion is invalid fail
5/27/2010,ok yeah this is clearly a meta-troll.
5/27/2010,"so, ccp, where are the alliance logos? it's been voted on and put forth by the csm. we have yet another major expansion to the game with nothing about alliance logos. where are they?it's not that hard! give me access to the code and i'll do it! make it so we can put them in ourselves and police it ourselves. or, if it's really something that you don't want us to have, take away alliance logos all together! it's not that difficult!"

5/27/2010,"i am not sure if it is in one of the chronicles or in the eve apocrypha novel that i read this, but as the story goes all wardecs are looked at by a concord official (or group of officials) to see if they should be allowed, or not.now, it seems to me, that the current officials are either asleep with their foreheads on the ""allow wardec"" button, or they are/have been bought off to allow all wardecs.so the fix is simple: replace the current officials with new ones who must pass a revised test to see if they are fit for the position (as the current process for selection is obviously faulty), and appoint an oversight committee to further guard against corruption of this specific group.capsuleers are demigods, not gods, they have limits, and those limits are imposed and enforced by concord. wardecs were never intended to be the free pass they are now.before anyone pipes up about the so-called ""fee"", that fee is only to submit your wardec and to continue hostilities, assuming hostilities are permitted, it does not guarantee that your wardec will be allowed.but, considering how big the hole the quality assurance department must fill in, courtesy of the tyrannis dev team, i doubt they have any spare personnel to fill these roles, so even if my idea is workable, i'm not expecting it to be implemented....well, ever."
5/27/2010,i don't mind it as long as concord is removed along with non-mutual wardecs.
5/27/2010,"look did it ever occur to any of these care bears that some other care bear group wanted to care bear in the area you guys got to first?? and so they hired someone to make your life a pain??? im sick of people crying about war decks and anyone that says this game is not a pvp game truly does not understand the overall driving force of this game. everything in this game form the market indy side of live is driven by the pvp demand in one form or another. look i have a few friends that care bear all day and i felt bad when they got stuck in a crap situation and had no way to defend their stash... but ya know its hard to be too sympathetic considering they all have billions and the thought of paying someone else to defend them or spending money on anything other than there miner stuff is just not acceptable to them.you need to figure out how to do business, this factor has been around for quite some time, and others have figured out how to deal with it. is it really that hard to try and work together and practice some pvp to defend yourself? you have so much money compared to the avg pvpr and while 1vs1 you might not be as well most indy groups are far more organized, however their lack of experience makes them panic and the factor of loss is just too great to them.look crying in the forums about how you cant stand getting killed because chances are high that the first few times you got targeted you cried and became a favored target by many mercs.. learn to read between the lines and figure out a tactic crying about it just makes you look bad / weak and now i hope more mercs will come find you and hunt you out as you have placed a giant bulls eye on your name. like some others said join an alliance.. figure out how to find like minded people who have figured out what you have not.. basic pvp skills dont require months upon months of training or practice.. the time it took you to write your posts you could have been reading a few pirate guides on pvp and tactics and target pickingthere is so much you can do aside from cry so try maybe asking for help on concepts.. such as hay guys i have been decked so many times and i really dont know how to stop from being a target.. or.. move!!! find a better place thats not in super care bear area... but ooo... you might have to find a different way to do things and hay you like were your at why should anyone else have a chance to do what your doing you were there first.. screw them .. o wait.. they paid someone to run us out of town .. screw you cry baby"
5/27/2010,sometimes you have to wonder if people think before they talk/write.this idea is flawed in so many ways it is not funny.when has war ever been consensual?
5/27/2010,"i'd like this to be taken 1 step further.i propose that ppl wishing to get back into empire and who are traveling through 0.0 and lowsec to get there should also be immune to bubbles, gatecamps and every other form of agression due to the fact it isn't mutual!"
5/27/2010,"i propose skillbooks, ore, etc. to be renamed as in the following examples:skill, scienceskill, gunnery etc...ore, veldsparore, mercoxit etc...that way when organized by 'group' the alphabetic sorting system can really group like items together.(as it is now i have to stack stuff in containers, and even there it can be difficult to organize because items are not grouped together based on type (i.e. skillbook) but rather alphabetically so that spaceship command and gunnery are not grouped together, because of rigs, minerals, misc, etc happen to be grouped inbetween.i mean, if tritanium and zydrine can be grouped together under minerals, then why not other things?so basically rename some stuff. real easy to do in a database.some more examples:blueprint, rig (instead of rig blueprint)blueprint, fast loaderdrone, combatdrone, scoutdrone, miningmissile, lightmissile, cruisemissile, heavy, fof(see how you don't have to jump all over your inventory to find stuff?)"
5/27/2010,may one deduce that you've never tried just right clicking and selecting 'sort by type'?
5/27/2010,"type sorting does not work in list/details view. only group.but either way it sorts them alphabetically in a completely arbitrary way.the easiest way to fix this, i can see, is to tidy up the nomenclature.or introduce the type option to list/details.i like my method better, because it would look better in list.not everybody wants to memorize every icon in eve.some of us like to do the extra reading."
5/27/2010,the mechanics skill group has been cluttered by skills that don't quite feel at home there.suggestion : all rigging skills and all <shiptype/outpost> construction skills should be moved to different or new groups.the science skill group could use a cleaning as well. perhaps moving some invention-specific and t3 reverse engineering skills and of course skills for item usage such as the doomsday device and jump portal generation.these changes will not take very long at all and would improve the overall quality of the skill groups.thanks for your time.
5/27/2010,"i think thats a good idea, reorganize the skill list and where neccesary add some more skills.. navigation? some higher level armor and shield skills? specs for the xl guns? more mining skills to improve speed/yield/etc?"

5/27/2010,this thread is a re-hash of a previous csm proposaldescription here:
5/27/2010,you already passed this. why are you trying to pass it again?
5/27/2010,it never got implementedthe courier missions are still being re-done but there's no talk about making the dropped loot valuable. only bulky.
5/27/2010,not supported.....if only cause every post ive seen from mazzilliu has been a waste of my time
5/27/2010,"i agree.. as a camper my self on my main.. i have to say many people dont understand the tricks involved with gett'n to a cloaked pilot adn its very doable. orbiting the gate at 12 with drones out is not the trick. but with practice and skill its pretty easy. there has to be some way to get by cloaking is nothe problme.. so it falls back to tactics, your idea is old and dated and has been denied for very good reasons by ccp who is far smarter at considering everyone before making a change.. if they say no there are some reasons for it and i sugest you learn how to fly destroyers..they have plenty of roles and fw for one really gave them a bumb, sadly only one of them gets a dps + which is why its the most feared by many frig pilota bt that doesnt mean the others are worthless. everythign in this game for pvp falls onto the world of tactics.. who you fly with what you do.. there is something for everyone.. if youw ant to decloak people be an inty pilot and figure ou some tricks... other then ships that can warp cloaked and even them at times back in my inty days almost 99% of the time i was able to bumb the cloaker.. proper bubles etc are key as well but again thats were tactics and skill come into play.. destroyers are fleet rides.. they have fleet tactics.. figure them out"
5/27/2010,"i personally would love for ccp to put in and auto detect and ban system in place to get rid of these people who spam the jita chat with scams via macros and miners who use them, with all the additions being put in place like new features ect. im sure the removal of the macro users will lessen the server load, not to mention the market prices stableize do to the fact that the ""real"" miners who spend real time mining ect. will not be rediculasly under bid by those who just run a macro and collect."
5/27/2010,dude . do some home work.. ccp bans many players and they go in large waves as that is the most effective ks.. yway to sweep the problems out.. 2nd of all sadly most of the scamers and such in jita are simple cut and paste live players just like you and the game is buyer be ware.. they have changed somethings in contracts to amke it harder but people keep thinking of new tricksu want to stop scammers and put them all out of buisness then figure out a cure fo greed.. and lazy people because without them scamers would make nothing from scam'n..
5/27/2010,"-make it so you can be targetted while emergency warping in all cases-make it so you cant warp out of bubbles while ewarping, and you stop e-warping if a bubble is dropped on you in all cases.-also cut your agility by half(or double it, whatever makes you"
5/27/2010,"1) only insofar as you can be targeted while normal warping. 2) obvious yes. 3) why? this seems crazy. 4) tentative yes. e-warping should have the same game mechanics as normal warping, except that you're logged off."
5/27/2010,"3- if someone logs off in a belt instantly when someone comes in local(even, robotically, you might say), then the increased warping time gives the attacker a chance to scan them down in the belt and maybe catch them if they're fast enough or lucky enough. this change means that logging off is not any better than warping off in any possibility."
5/27/2010,i see what you are trying to do but the same arguement will apply - those players that genuinly lose connection shouldnt be penalised not supported
5/27/2010,"bad ideas. this will hurt people with bad connections more than help people wanting to gank players in gate camps.all ccp have to do is make logging off take 5-10 seconds if you do it yourself. ctrl-q will prompt a 5-10 second timer, at the end of which you'll get a confirmation box ""are you sure you want to log off?"" or something along those lines.edit: on second thought, there's nothing stopping people from just unplugging their router instead of ctrl-q so it would be pointless and a waste of time making the log off thing. just deal with the cowards tbh."
5/27/2010,what athena said. i some times lose connection and we all do. i have never logged off to avoid a kill. i have the kill mails to prove it. lol cry. but i shouldn't die when my f'n isp drops me either.
5/27/2010,if they log of in a belt cuz they were ratting then they are agroed and can be probed out and killed while not logged on.. pretty easy. the main warp changes were becuase of a log off trick / exploit that was abused big time to change warp in points when a target was getting hunted they could just log off and on a ton of times and the waiting hunters would never know were the target would land and more often then nto land 200 + away from the max warp point.. a cheep tactic.
5/27/2010,"just a little usability issue here, the assets tab information need to be sorted into columns so you can, say, sort your assets by how many jumps away the system is. or sort by how many items you have. it also makes it easier on the eyes."
5/27/2010,"minor, but sensible."
5/27/2010,"umm...there's already an option to list by name of system, number of jumps, and quantity of items. it's in the upper-left hand corner. there are also options in each drop-down menu to sort by name, group, quantity, and slot. and then there are 5 tabs to look for things everywhere, in the region, in the constellation, solar system, and station. there's also a search function. strangely enough though, there's no option to sort by meta level. i've already posted a thread about that though."
5/27/2010,"i just have to say thisquit being a ****ing dumbass.edit:on the (most likely) false assumption that this isn't a troll (uh huh, sure), file a petition, you idiot."

5/27/2010,"right now lowsec income is pretty terrible, so here's a few ideas for making it better:1. move dark ochre and hemorphite to lowsec exclusively, and make it available in all lowsec systems. currently dark ochre /hem isn't mined very much because the vast majority of nocxium comes from mission loot. but with the mission loot nerf, people are going to have to start mining it. dark ochre is the main nocxium bearing mineral(with hemorphite trailing closely behind), with a few other minerals bearing only trace amounts of nocx. nocxium is also the most transportable middle end ore there is. this should bring miners to lowsec, because if the majority of the nocxium needs to be mined, the price will stabilize to the point where it becomes worthwhile to mine in lowsec despite the ship losses.nocxium will still be available in 0.0 though crockite, jaspet, and hemorphite- the issue is that you will need to import nocx to get a balanced mix.2. boosting ratting. right now lowsec belt spawn profits are somewhere between the profit gained between highsec, and that of 0.0. the problem is that lowsec is more dangerous than 0.0(in that it is more crowded), but it also has the advantages of being easier to deal with logistically(many npc stations, closer to empire, safe gate passage for small ships that don't dawdle). i think that the ratting income of lowsec should be increased so that it is about 50-75% of the income of corresponding 0.0 systems(to 0.1 sec is 75% the income of awesome 0.0 space, .04 sec has 75% the income of terrible 0.0 space)3. more 0.0 entrances. add many more 0.0 entrances so that you can enter 0.0 any time you want if you are simply willing to take a few jumps extra. currently in some places you have to spend half an hour to an hour flying to get around a single gatecamp. and that's bull****more entrances means more people entering 0.0 through gates, and that means more passers by for lowsec pirates to kill."
5/27/2010,"1) i don't think you got a single fact correct in that whole proposal. the most nocx-heavy mineral is hemorphite, followed by jaspet and hedbergite, all three of which are lowsec minerals. dark ochre has a decent amount and crokite has a bit, both of which are 0.0 rock. nocx is supplied for the most part from the drone regions, it is actually the second least-dropped mineral in missions(only zyd is lower). so the t1 loot nerf is secondary, the drone metal nerf is the relevant one. also, having a material available at a higher sec but not a lower one is just plain weird, and i see no good reason for it. this part of your proposal is bizarre and stupid. 2) not crazy, but your numbers are off. is bad 0.0 ratting really 75% as good as good 0.0 ratting? if not, and i'm almost certain it's not, you're proposing to make 0.1 better than bad 0.0, which is again odd and probably unwise. also, this got buffed in the fairly recent past, i'm not sure they'd go for another. 3) this one i'll agree on. space should be closely tied together close to empire, and stringy and disconnected with lots of bottlenecks further out."
5/27/2010,"1. alright, by volume hemorphite is the nost nocxium rich mineral. the details are going to be tentative anyways because ccp are going to be changing mining and minerals in the future anyways. the important idea is that nocxium is made into a lowsec exclusive mineral.the place i am getting these numbers from is this eveo post:"
5/27/2010,"lowsec is pirate territory. if you wanna make more isk in lowsec, start pirating. or you could sun lvl 5 missions and sell faction mods. there are so many ways to make isk in this game, i don't think ccp needs to waste time catering for a relatively small percentage of the player base."

5/27/2010,"wouldn't surprise me. these threads have been thick with some very, very obvious alt-trolling. and some of them seem to have a pattern by which they feign mental ******ation in order to make certain claims. i must admit, it's a novel strategy... a bit like urinating in your pants in order to embarrass the guy you're talking to."
5/27/2010,"the pattern is easy to see really, they all speak in exactly the same manner, using good english but occasionally slipping in a german (or italian?) word order or strange translation. he also started posting in my thread on eve-o within hours after he got banned from eveger, all characters have at some point been affiliated with a certain corp in xelas and last but not least they are all spewing the same bull**** over and over again in exactly the same wording. it's not rocket surgery ;)"
5/27/2010,"let's just call him natana, he hates that."
5/27/2010,"this: please do post with your main. i mean, i understand that you hide behind your editorial alt, but it is not hard to post with you main, believe me. i do it too, i mean all guys and lads with enough courage do that.ok, i am older than both of your troll-alts (my toon is over 5 years ingame), but i promise i will go easy on you. post with your main.(the story with your sokratesz-alt gets really old though.)"
5/27/2010,dun dun
5/27/2010,"seriously troll, honest question... since you're obviously very bad at trolling and your attempts to make people annoyed really are just, well, embarrassing for you personally, why are you doing it? you're an obvious alt, no kills and only three losses, a handfull of posts in 2005 and then a bunch now, all supporting ankhybonkybonkers or her ideology. you're in an npc corp and have been for 95% of your time in eve, and your sec standing and relationships show that you've never even spent an hour on pve, either. you're not fooling anybody, and it's pretty obvious that you're hiding behind your alt. meanwhile, sok is a csm candidate and aaa pilot with a long standing history, and i'm a razor pilot with a long standing history both in and out of the game and more than 1000 kills with rzr during my time here. nobody believes that you're really stupid enough to think that either of us are alts, let alone that an aaa csm delegate has a rzr alt that he'd risk burning by posting to the same thread with it. so why feign such a level of stupidity and act so dishonestly as to make accusations that everybody knows you don't really believe, and make you look like there's something wrong with you? why dishonestly complain about non-alts from your blatantly obvious alt account... using the three-year-old's taunt of ""i know you are but what am i!""and all in order to annoy people who aren't annoyed by your trolling? what's your goal and why won't you post with your main, what are you afraid of? i'm honestly curious. are you capable of answering honestly? or at least of stepping up the quality of your trolling?"
5/27/2010,she was voted in due to a very efficent campaign and by kicking her out you'd be invalidaing legit votes. regardless of why you like or don't like her why not wait and see what she does first.-t'amber
5/27/2010,what is pathetic? csm? hm...
5/27/2010,this.plus i expect that any and all candidates actually do as they said. else i am gonna start a petitioning campaign to get a csm removed for voting fraud. good thing about representatives is that the voterbase can hold them to their word and can start up a large roar when they don't and act opposite as they were voted for.so look how representatives do and talk then.
5/27/2010,"csm is irrelevant. why does it matter if this person was ""elected"" or not? won't make a difference either way..."
5/27/2010,depending on how you view it :p
5/27/2010,"einstein,you know, there are other occupations in eve outside pvp and missions, do you? ok, in case you dont: i am a trader and industrialist. i do not need to leave my station to make up for my living in eve.i sit behind my beloved excel sheets (quite similar to my real life job) and manipulate the markets and earn hella isk. the war for example was really a great opportunity for me: 182 billion isk and counting.now have a good day, dear finnahonkywonky-troll. one day i buy your alliance and sell it to molle.btw, who are you now? finnahollywolly oder sokratesz? your alt posting confuses me."
5/27/2010,"i really do find this hilarious.wether or not you agree with ankhs policies is not relevant.she went out and campaigned to the public and convinced over 3300 people to vote for her . take into account that most delegates did not have to campain or convince people to vote for them , but simply got gifted the position through an alliance block vote , its a pretty good achievement.the opposite end would be mazzilliu , who tried to gain the low-sec/pirate vote , on the basis that her corp was, in the distant past a low-sec pirate corp. the reality was that she may have once, over 2 years ago shot a neutral in low-sec, knows very little about the mechanics of low sec , her alliances interest in low sec appears to be dropping super carriers + blobs into low sec for risk free pvp .( now understands that posting cheesy ""look at me i am a girl"" vids does not get men reaching for their voting equipment)even with her alliance supporting her she raised about 1/3 of the votes that ankh did, strip out the alliance/mate block vote and i suspect she convinced far less then 10% of the amount of people to vote for her then ankh did.this does not mean that i agree with all, or any, of ankhs ideas , but i do know who i think is more deserving of a csm delegate position."
5/27/2010,"wich is why i want to find a valid reason to remove her from the csm.barring we are unable to find a way to remove her, we should at least put up stricter rules on how csm candidates can campaign, such as no fearmongering spam evemails."
5/27/2010,"cool, so lets get half of all elected csms banned? they all have spammend and promoted in various channels and on numerous boards."
5/27/2010,"no, posting in other eve-related forums with a single ad, or having a legitimate topic, is fine.this however, is not:i spoke with her in local after this spam, and she admitted to just finishing up her tour of spam to all the highsec hubs."
5/27/2010,quite aware thanks and im very happy:) any other pointless remarks you like to say?

5/28/2010,"tl;dr: add to the tactical overlay a representation of ships' speed in the form of speed vectors (a segment originating from the ships of length proportional to speed) well visible at any level of zoom.this feature should be an option of the esc menu to save on client cpu in case of need (big fleet fights)the overview should have a new filter to decide what ships show the speed vector (out of fleet, reds, dramiels only ...) and the segment would be of the same colour as the top corresponding overview colour (fleet/same militia/same corp/etc)when doing a 1v1, i usually 'look at' my target to see what he's doing and anticipate the reaction time. when the numbers grow, i switch the look at between the various enemies, but it becomes impossible after a little number of targets.resorting to the overview, with its lagged and sporadic changes, is not enough, and also the overview is hard to follow when there's more than a handful of ships in the encounter. a graphic overview - in addition to the table - is needed.solution: ships show a vector that points in the direction where they're going, of length proportional to the ship's speed: a speed vector. zoom level does not affect the vector length. this permits, at a glance, to see where everybody's moving to, even if zoomed out. a shortcut key to turn on and off the tactical overlay would be welcome.possible variants:- smoke trails. the problem is that smoke trails disappear zooming out, i want this to be visible at large zoom levels to help small gang warfare. the two don't exclude each other anyway! also, a vector causes much less performance issues.possible problems:- lag-- server side lag: none. the vector is a client only thing, the client builds it based on info it already gets, no new server coding is needed-- client side lag: possible. to avoid it completely, add an option under graphics in the esc menu to remove the speed vectors.- crowded overview: possible. the overview filter should accommodate a new option to extend filters done for the overview to the speed vectors. you could then show or not the speed vectors based on the friendly/unfriendly/in fleet/... status of the ships.please support me! i am for small gangs warfare!"
5/28/2010,"great idea, thought about that too.not really sure about this one tho. imo, vector should represent distance ship will travel in a certain timeframe (with speed it has at the moment) so you can predict it's location (more or less) using tactical overview gird.also vector should be projected to tactical overview gird (similiar to ship location) to make it easier a bit."
5/28/2010,tl;dr: bring back trails
5/28/2010,do want.
5/28/2010,"+1. it should stay the same size with zoom, otherwise you won't be able to see it at either end (either off the screen or too small). it should turn on/off with tactical overlay."
5/28/2010,"thanks for the support! <3it's important to see them when zoomed out, because even small gang engagements can be at fairly long distances. maybe change the vectors when zooming but not so much as the zoom would make them as a compromise."

5/28/2010,support!
5/28/2010,this is a good idea.-liang
5/28/2010,"love this idea. you should callthe proposal: ""making missions fun"". perhaps the ideas could be integrated with the live events somehow?"
5/28/2010,"who really need any interesting mission running or ratting, those are just for grinding isk.if you really need interesting content try to interact with other players, there is lot of ways to do that in eve."
5/28/2010,"i'm for this, but you could leave some grind-missions for n00bs.that way, once your agents feel you're ready, they could gradually introduce you to this. (xp based?)there might be a need for a separate chat-channel that only gets accessible once you are referred by the agents.this would allow the n00bs learn to interact with other players on these missions. maybe this could wean them off carebearedness? yea, i know, that's what corps are for. and fw. but alot of us would rather first team up against smart npc's and gradually get used to pvp. (is it too far fetched to maybe tie this in with fw in the future?)"
5/28/2010,or of course you could make that grinding isk interesting and fun instead of a stupid boring part of something that should be fun (a game).
5/28/2010,"the general proposition is good. i do not do missions nor plexes that much, simply beacause they are boring. when i do, its nullspace complexes, beacause of the distant feeling of pvp, when somebody comes to _my_ local and shoots hes/her combat probes out. trying to finish the complex before being probed is a generally fun thingie. ofcourse it ends up in a exploded ship every now and thenm, but thats eve ;)i know, that i will be butchered for this statement, but ... wow has some good multiplayer pve content. instances. they really need tactic, they need a wery straight battleplan and they need wery good co-operation of players. big part of wow pve is purely grinding, but there is those instances, that are wery easily compareable with deadspace complexes.now, take the basic idea of wow instances to eve deadspace complexes, add dynamicity, and that would be the ultimate multiplayer pve content of mmo's. it really makes me wonder, that doing a gurista mace with bs's needs about 3-5 rr bs's to accomplish, but is easily doable with two drakes. so i would like to see also the deadspace content to change in more intelligent direction so, that it has some means to make them unsoloable, or unduoable. i would like to see that if a single drake engages a 10/10 complex, all the sentry towers would be neut and web, but if coming with a fleet, there could be a little jamming, or sensor dampening.however, i do not like the fact, that there is only two deadspace complexes that are not soloable with a single drake in a cheap deadspace hardener fitting. and this is not ment to be a challenge to nerf drake, but to make those complexes more intelligent so that they would recognize their enemies better. i do hate the drake, and i do not fly it by any means. i've been forced to train a tengu to that pve (isk) content beacause of my principles of nbot flying a drake. so make my 90 day skillplan useless and do more intellect pve content.i would like to add, that the missionrunning intelligence could be a good way to add lowsec uniqicity (spelling?). leave the highsec missions alone, make completely new set of intelligent missions to lowsec. and make those 0.0 deadspace complexes even more intelligent and fleet orientated. all this would ofcourse need a little buff in the reward department ^^ericedit: spelling"
5/28/2010,in that case supported
5/28/2010,why shouldn't making isk also be fun?
5/28/2010,"i really like this.it would be great if npc faction fleets of varying strength would strike out into the heart of eve, so that every planet moon and gate was attacked, camped, and then the pve community had to go destroy them.or just small roving band, or just anything besides these idiotic missions."
5/28/2010,"now that we are able to manufacture bacteria from pi, the imminent threat of impetigo and syphilis from sharing pod goo looms dark and menacing over the proclivities of all soon-to-be-walking-in-stations capsuleers.these towels are all that stand in the way of these tiny microscopic barbarians. we cannot allow the capsuleer community to fall over like special effects from war of the worlds. supported."

5/28/2010,"rolling too many items into a single proposal like this makes it tricky to support - so i won'ti support many of the ui fixes. i do not support attaching the modular ui into a fixes proposal. modular ui should be a totally separate proposal so it doesn't cause the other ui fixes to be rejected. it certainly can't be left as a single bullet point in a list of ""fixes""i will outline my objection to the modular ui right now and why i can't support this proposal whilst it is included.it creates a huge opportunity for exploiting (see below)it needs some kind of limited scripting support (using python whilst bits of the ui already use it could end badly)if ccp have to vet all modules then it requires a significant effort from devs who would be better utilised elsewherethere would be continued pressure on ccp to vet new versions of modules - they can't even find the time to put alliance logos into game let alone hundreds of random ui mods.modular ui is a gateway to ""exploits""yes i've used addon modules in other games, but they were either pve or pvp-lite (no consequences to dying other than waiting up to 30 seconds for a respawn). even then people came up with hundreds of unique ways to game the addon system.in eve where ship loss has consequence any module that gives somebody an edge over a player using a vanilla client is damaging to the game as a whole. yes anyone could use the same module but then you get into a cycle of having to upgrade modules every few days etc. i've done this with other games and it was annoying as hell.""join fleet, make sure you have cta_fleetassist v1.234 and cta_needarmour v2.34 installed""*shudder*other people (with detailed ideas on a modular ui) have suggested that ccp could vet all addons and only allow ""certified"" ones to load thus reducing the possibility of exploiting. this would take a significant amount of time from technical staff at ccp and would have to be repeated for each version of each module.the next question is what you could actually do with a modular ui? it is pretty clear that modules shouldn't be able to take action on your behalf so no automatically shield boosting when you get to a certain threshold and then turning off the booster again at another threshold. but without the ability to take action in your scripting what are you actually adding?even if a module can only modify / filter ui elements you can get an unfair advantage over a ""vanilla"" client. for example, one of the suggestions made would be to add grouping to local chat so making it easier to highlight war-targets/reds in system. sound reasonable? unfortunately it makes local even more powerful as an intel tool. add a likely ability to pop-up a warning message and you've just built a replacement for bacon which was deemed an exploit.of course you can argue that such a module would never get past ccp vetting, but again that kind of checking implies ccp spending hours of dev time on it then the inevitable forum threads calling out ccp for blocking it.ccp have already rejected a modular ui a number of times, don't try to shoehorn it into a general ui fixes proposal. if you must raise it again please split it into its own (and sufficiently detailed) proposal."
5/28/2010,"modular ui has nothing to do with moddable ui. the major difference is that with the first, ccp makes all the elements and with the second, the players run off to make their homebrew ui.modular ui would be that players can pick from pre-created ui elements what their ui looks like, so combat pilots end up with a totally different ui than a miner if they so wish. players can also say if they want drop-down menus as they exist now, or a totally different type of interface.the reason why this proposal is very general is because there have been dozens of ui fixes proposed already and they are just band-aid fixes. i can re-raise 50 issues or just create one issue that covers it all, your choice.the proposal is a request for tearing down the ui as it is, and building it from scratch, with hopefully including as many features as listed in the proposal."
5/28/2010,crazy: supporting all that has to do with fixing stuff that is broken ~o~
5/28/2010,"poasting in a lol ankgjfkdfsdhfhdsfs thread, ha ha.i have one major gripe with the proposal, which is no moddable ui, thank you. there are two (or three, if you allow third party addons) problems with this:1) added complexity. with the goal of making eve less daunting, adding ui customization makes it, in fact, more daunting. particularly if the default ui is not very usable (and it should be said, default ui layout/settings/overview settings are as of now very unusable and require you to practically spend 15 minutes whenever you reinstall to get to ""workable"" level).2) it offloads fixing usability problems from ccp to the players. as much as customization is on one side nice, making players do ccp's job is not. making people unable to play well/compete without special ui-foo is also very bad, and ties into problem (1). adding ""fix the ui"" as something a new player must do in addition to learning the numerous game mechanics eve has adds extra complexity/annoyance factor. 3) if you allow third-party addons, you get something which is exploitable/provides a unfair advantage. some addons (eg. sorting local by standings, automated intel gathering from local, automating many many tasks, etc) would not only become completely mandatory but would also imbalance many game mechanics which work just fine now. having to download 5-6 mods to be able to compete also adds to annoyance factor, really.in addition to this, ccp has a certain vision of how eve should visually look like, and if anything that is a major reason why they won't go for moddable ui/etc.so while general ui improvments are good and nobody can really argue that they are not (which is why it's very popular to propose ui fixes among wannabe internet politicians), i cannot support the original proposal.it would be nice if first and foremost ccp made the default ui/etc/overview settings more functional. explaining to newbies how they should set up their ui for the 100th time gets boring fast. improving the coverage of overview customization in the tutorial would be good, as well as making overview customization less clunky (tabs, i'm looking at you here)."
5/28/2010,"not supporting. the interface, although it has it's ups and downs, is the least important. when i install i import my old/alliance overview setting, join some channels and i'm set.a modular ui would take time and resources away from truly important matters such as lag reduction (both traffic and grid)."
5/28/2010,agreedand dual screen support !!!
5/28/2010,"the problem i see with this distinction is that it is more a matter of degree than of kind. just rearranging the buttons and menus a bit isn't going to put band-aids on many of the potholes in the ui; to do that requires being able to rewire what the ui elements do, and that shades into addon territory.i am totally in agreement with teadaze here. since ""the perfect is the enemy of the good"", csm has to keep updating their list of potholes that need to be filled, and make ""building the hyperspace bypass"" a separate issue.i further agree that the biggest concern about addons is the potential for exploits. one idea that came out of the election campaign discussions was this:if ccp is going to refresh the ui anyway, then take a little extra time and build in addon capability. the official ui is thus the official set of ccp addons.allow player addons only on singularity.then people with ui concerns can build and test potential fixes, which makes it easier for csm and other players to debate and refine them. even if no player code ends up in the official client, the utility demonstration and implementation skeleton should be useful to ccp. and i think you will agree that it limits the potential for exploits!the questions are: (a) can a business case be made for such a proposal (ie: will it save them money) and (b) will such limited addon capability be a useful tool in getting ui changes implemented?"
5/28/2010,"i think theres quite a few different ideas as to what these words mean and it may be confusing the subject a little. making the ui modular and creatively dynamic would then allow it to be modable, and so would be the first step (i think this is what anhk is getting at) and allow much easier changing of existing problems. making or allowing ccp/ player mods would and should be a later development. although i'm still of the mind that ""player made anything"" that effects the game shouldn't give anyone an advantage to those that don't code or cannot use these mods properly, and would need intesive ccp scrutiny.-t'amber"
5/28/2010,agreed. the ui needs desperate fixing. it's far too clunky.
5/28/2010,"i don't understand the fairness objection to a moddable ui. basically, what you're saying is that ccp's ui is so markedly inferior to what players can create that anyone who uses it is at a significant disadvantage. how exactly is that an endorsement of the status quo?i agree that moddability is rightly a separate proposal from the more small-scale fixes. you don't want to conflate the two when presenting the idea to ccp, because they're fairly different. but moddability would be good. ccp has already said no, and i know that re-raising issues isn't the best use of time, but if you can ask around over lunch or something, i'd appreciate it."
5/28/2010,"as much as i would like to have moddability, that opens out a whole can of worms, and ccp seems to be unwilling to deal with that. would be nice to have, but elt's get back on topic. i would like to have a ui that is as adjustable and personasible as possible, so yes. i would like to have new ui. i would like for one expansion cycle to be commited to it, or for it to be done gradually full support, it needs to be done, sooner or later ccp will need to bite the bullet."
5/28/2010,how many right-click menus should i have to navigate through to advise my fleet to warp to a moon?
5/28/2010,"an example of unfair:someone makes a mod + scripts to make mass bpo researching capable at a couple of clicks of your mousethis tool isn't released (or released with full functionality) to the rest of the communityi can't see how this would be fair to people who have no programming skill and i believe everyone should have the same advantages in-game. if however every player submitted mod had to be vetted through ccp and then downloaded from one of their sources then everyone would have the same chance, although this would probably cost significant ccp resources.if however you're just talking about making the ui skinable (with no scripting or macro functionality or support) which is what i think anhks post is actually about; i can't see any possible issues (other than ccp saying they're not going to do anything with the gui). eve gui skins available as ingame items would be awesome, skins for each race, pirate faction, rare skins... i have a whole post on this somewhere in these halls... probably on page 128 or something.modular ui to me means something more like this:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.-t'amber"
5/28/2010,"yet rts games, which can also be pretty hardcore, can have custom uis without everyone *****ing about that it would be unfair?modular ui would add more work for people to get right, and i would agree more options isnt always better. but then ccp could just make a feature to export/import xml of ui, and people can just take some standard ones.fully moddable ui is however the only thing that will result in a good ui. and if ccp would make a reasonable ui themselves the advantage of other people wouldnt be too large. besides that it is just a matter of downloading the ui yourself if you also want that advantage. i dont see anyone here complaining that if i go to a belt to pvp with normal overview settings in a fleet i might as well self destruct, there it apparently is okay for people to customize it."
5/28/2010,"a possible solution for the fairness issue is that all addons be public, open-source, digitally-signed by ccp and revokable by them. so no secret i-win buttons. the half-life of an abusive addon would likely be days, but the issue of the cost to ccp of responding to abuse complaints is a significant one.very pretty skin, btw."
5/28/2010,fix some of the damn factions too *edit* 5 minute repost delay sucks - why is everything created by ccp designed to be as unpleasant to use as possible?
5/28/2010,"would love to see some attention given to fw but can't support the proposal for these two reasons:a fairly large proportion of fw players are experienced pvpers who don't care for politics and occupancy, we just want a fight with out the bull of null alliances and time consuming logistics. these older players often provide a link between fw and null sec while also passing on their experience and enthusiasm to newer pvpers. fw needs to be a place where the jaded and cynical eve crusties can relax in a t1 cruiser while those who are fresh and eager from the null sec fights can learn to fc.i'm worried that thinking of fw as something for ""new players and carebears"" will turn it into a mini version of null and ""consequences to system occupancy"" stinks of alarm clock cta's. the biggest strength of fw is that it's a melting pot of people from all round new eden and that is the thing that needs encouraged the most.the op is too vague to be able to say how much of it is a good idea so i'll respond with a list of things that i see as the bedrock of fw and the reason i've spent more time in heimatar than null sec. consensual pvp that is open and available to all (interesting mix of people, abilities and fleet sizes) no consequences that are important enough for ceo's to call an alarm clock cta's (ie no station ping pong or economic repercussions for the losers other than ship costs) no rewards that are big enough to attract the attention of null alliances. low logistical requirements (no tcu's, poses or other requirements to spend a billion isk and play anchoring online)edit:a number of alliances and individuals have bankrolled militia corps in the past and it only works when both sides have the resources to fund capital ships, otherwise you end up with two groups of bored pvpers who won't engage because of the inevitable hot drop. while it's nice to have the occasional cap battle the last thing i want to see is the fun little groups of 5 or so pvpers dying out because they're worried about alliance blobs.anyways, grats on getting elected and good luck in getting some dev time for fw. there's some good stuff in there so i look forward to seeing the proposal when it's more fleshed out."
5/28/2010,"faction warfare on war for occupancy is mostly dead, if you look at plexing stats you can find that from every militia there is only total 50 chars who take more than one or more plex / day, and if you know better about those chars you can find out that almost half of those are pervs members or their alts. there is also couple of known gallente plexing alts.so total number of actual active plexers is quite low. ccp does not fix fw plexing because only about 30-50 actual players play it on daily.there is no reason to take plexes or fight those, so there is no fightning. plexing happens mostly when you can do it without resistance.so i do support that ccp should fix bugs, because exploiting those is bad for overall attitude for exploiting, some players thinks that it is all right to exploit those bugs.but as fw is dead it is just waste of time to fix those, it is just better to end this war or change it to working one. fixing bugs does not change the fact that no one want to plex, there is no reason and there is no way to force or encourage people to go in the plex and fight to the end.only thing that people are happy is roaming with blob from oms to tama and back. blob ! the thing you can do better in 0.0 so...fw is dead."
5/28/2010,supported in full.
5/28/2010,i think that fw not just need some bugs fixed rather than get build up from scratch again but as far as we know that will never happen just like most of the stuff in csm
5/28/2010,"ha ha, posting in a ankkerwjnrjw thread.anyway, not supported.sure, bugs/exploits need a fix, nobody rational will oppose that.however:- plexing/system occupancy stuff has no tangible benefits really or reason to really fight over itbut on the other hand:- if this has a major impact and really hurts the losing side, then you have the 0.0 sov warfare reloaded with mandatory ops + blobbery and crap (and i suspect most bored 0.0 people who tried fw got away precisely to avoid that crap)- only having sense from a roleplaying perspective means it belongs in the ""**** nobody cares about"" cathegory- financial incentives for winning side do make sense somewhat, but on the other hand if it's not significant it again belongs in the ""**** nobody cares about"" cathegory, and if it is it will get farmed/exploited naturallyalso, tons of fw action really boils to:- form blob- roam a pipe like tama->oms or area around amamake- fight some other blob- rinse repeatwhich adds just more of the boring type of pvp and has only really had negative effects on the whole (from increased blobbery of fw peoples to forming of supersized pirate corps/alliances which blob/hotdrop left and right, basically reducing small scale pvp action in fw areas to practically nonexistent and driving people who do anything productive out of fw areas).most old low-sec denizens have gotten to really despise fw because it has brought a few good things and a lot of bad with it."
5/28/2010,"what's with all the melodrama? fw is the single most successful low sec initiative i've ever seen and it's a solid base to build on. as for your argument that there's no fighting because everybody's too busy blobbing, i hope you can see how you've just shot yourself in the foot.people do not join fw to orbit timers, they do it to get fights so forcing people to participate in pve activities like plexing will drive them away from fw. sure you get blob fleets but there's plenty of smaller fights if you want them.fw is as dead as eve is dying.general support for op added but with reservations outlined in my previous post."
5/28/2010,"there is no 'fix' to fw since it is fundamentally flawed, it needs to be rethought and redesigned from scratch.i made my suggestion as to how to go about it a while ago, but anything similar will do .. as long as focus is on pvp solo/small-gang/fleet with rp as a backdrop it will work.supported, if only to keep pressure on the beer-o-holics."
5/28/2010,"yes, there is pvp. but fw itself is dead, no one fights for occupancy."
5/28/2010,and that is exactly why it's successful.
5/28/2010,/signed
5/28/2010,i agree with much of what yani says. fw has some truly awesome game mechanics. the fact that you can get in a plex with only certain ship sizes means you can go in there and pvp without gettting blobbed! just move away from the warp in gate and if they come with huge numbers warp! if they come with something sensible you have some of the greatest fights in eve. why doesn't this currently lead to great pvp in plexes? 2 reasons: 1) npcs in the plexes ruin it. who wants to fight with your ability to win gimped by some intangible amount of rat dps and ewar from rats? its lame fighting when you are under fire from npcs. get rid of them in plexes. and 2) militias aren't informed when players enter plexes. when someone from fw enters a complex gate both sides should know who entered where and ship types. this is intel should just be provided via a seperate channel. after all if a system is contested that means both sides have spies there giving info. (here i mean not player spies but just npc spies that will post in the channel) that way the players could get a gang out there to fight them if they want before the plex runs. no npcs! but information about where you can find pvp! if you made those two changes i think plexing would make fw the absolute best pvp mechanic in the game.edit: i added this idea to features and ideas. if you want to discuss it. i don't want to derail this thread.
5/28/2010,"some good points well made there and others that seem a little irrelevant.there is one gripe i have with fw at the moment and that relates to faction standings. after the initial faction standing bump you get through promotions, there is no way in fw to actually improve your faction standings.this presents difficulties in a few situations, including, rr gangs where one or more of the pilots have -5 sec status. not only do you take the sec status hit for remote repping the pilot but you also take a faction standing hit for doing so. this just seems so wrong.this could be fixed by adding a small faction standing bonus to capturing plexes. this would not only help those who need the standings but would also encourage a lot more pilots to take part in plexing, which seems to be something that is desired."
5/28/2010,here's an idea: get rid of the plexes altogether. they're an awful idea and should go.
5/28/2010,it's annoying that now we have to brief every new player in how to fix evegate privacy.

5/28/2010,"minor, but good tweak to the interface.still not fixed in tyrannis (surprise!)."
5/28/2010,"this is our universe, and i damn well want to be able to play my role in shaping it.pc will always trump console for fps playability.that's not to say i hate consoles, own a 360 and love it."
5/28/2010,"cool opinion bro.a fun fact for you is that console players are different than pc players. dust 514 is meant to bring in the console players.if you want to be part of the eve universe and have a pc, you play eve-online. if you have a console, you play dust 514. if you have both a pc and console, then it is just a matter of what aspect of the eve universe you want to help shape at the time.what part of this concept do you guys not understand?"
5/28/2010,"this is a combination bump/extension. the extension is:there should be a way to set a non-first waypoint to a system that is adjacent to the one you are currently in without opening the map. for example:i'm in aunia. i just got back from a mission in agrallarier, which is adjacent to aunia. i need to go to eglennaert, where i left my salvager ship, and then back to agrallarier. i go to assets, find my ship, set a waypoint, no problem. i go to right click in space, go to stargates, agrallarier, set waypoint...and for some reason it sets the waypoint to aunia, not to agrallarier. so i have to go all the way through the map to set the waypoint. this is less annoying than the op, but still annoying."
5/28/2010,"so ccp can give us back the old 3d map, then steal the 2d maps from dotlan or that 2dmaps site and put those in. everyone's happy."
5/28/2010,it's impossible to get a dotlan style map for the eve universe as it isn't planar i.e. there will be overlaps.
5/28/2010,"the whole point here is to remove overlaps. yes, it'd have to be done manually, yes it wouldn't look exactly like it actually does, but then again if dotlan could do it why can't ccp?or maybe an option to show a ""symbolic map"", rather than just flat map."
5/28/2010,"it may be possible to do no-overlap maps on a region by region basis, but it's not possible (manually or automatically) to do a universe map that doesn't have overlaps because the solar system graph is non-planar."
5/28/2010,"when the fleet number reach over 100-150+ pilots, the lag is horrible because the fleet window refreshing every single seconds, when a pilot join or leave the fleet or a client got a member, loot , voice history message. the fleet fights lags become worse than before dominion patch for this reason.easy to see it. check the little round icon at window frame, every time when a pilot joined, the little icon starting circle around and refreshing the fleet member numbers and the client get lag. just close the fleet windows or drop fleet and voila the lag is gone or decreasing in a bigger fleet fight. but, someone closing the window he wont see the brodcasted commands, because the ccp merged the broadcast window with fleet window when dominion came out.so, need a solution.some timer setting need for ""my fleet"" window.1. ccp default settings2. manual refreshing - when a user click on button (no more server requests just when the user click button for needed datas - need for speed mode)3. timer settings (delayed mode) - 10sec,30sec,1 min,5 min.... etcfor history windows, like - voice, member, loot history.1. ccp default settings2. manual requesting (except broadcast history) - request button for history displaying (no more server requests just when the user click button for needed datas - need for speed mode)other solution.split again broadcast history from fleet windows and the user can close the fleet windows but see the broadcast messages without lag."

5/28/2010,regardless of
5/28/2010,"good ideas. on top of what's been mentioned, this change from tyrannis needs to be redone:it should be changed so high sec agents always give their missions in high sec (likewise for lowsec and nullsec). the current effect of this change is that missionrunners who don't want to go into lowsec will just move to a system surrounded by highsec, effectively negating the (assumed) intention of this change in the patch because those systems will become more crowded."
5/28/2010,"figured since all my post get rolled, i might as well serve this one up and get it shot down:if you are in a 0.5 system or higher, you can not give any remote whatever to anyone not in your corporation.also in before someone complains that i stole their idea from them./me winks at marlona sky i also did not use my signature writing style even though i still get much fan mail for it."
5/28/2010,"can cause some problems.for example, corp a is at war with corp b and c. if remote reps are forbidden across corps, corp b and c cannot effectively assist each other against a common enemy."
5/28/2010,"not only that, if someone has multiple chars that are not all in one corp for whatever reason he would be unable to use them together in missions for example. also it would hamper cooperation between friends. so i think this is a bad idea."
5/28/2010,"so nerf neutral rr... why? yeah it sucks when you have it happen but eve isn't supposed to be fair. if you want fair, go play an fps or something. oh and give me all your stuff when you leave."

5/28/2010,"however i do support the fact, that retribution needs a second low, there is a problem. you cant give it to it, if not taken away from somewhere else, or without buffing the other af's aswell. the other af's could live with a little buff too, but to many of them a extra slot would make them kind of win for free cards.so therefore i would take one highslot from the retri and move it to the middle. that would make it a lot more useable.i too do not like having ships without point in my fleets. the retribution is allowed shipclass thou, but if any else ship is without point, the pilot gets yelled at.so basically i do support, but not alone the retribuotion, or if only the retri, take move a highslot to midslot!eric"
5/28/2010,"the ""its not a solo boat"" argument comes up every time and tbh, its got nothing to do with solo at all. yes, an extra mid would make it possible to use it as solo boat, but the fact is that in gangs you can never be usefull apart from doing dps makes it pretty useless."
5/28/2010,"i agree with this, remove a high slot and put it in med."
5/28/2010,"the problem here is that you seem to think that anything that's ""player driven"" has to be stopped by the players. but that's not really the case - if the players are taking the game a direction that ccp doesn't want, they're absolutely free to nerf it. in fact, it may even be the right choice to nerf it to save the players from themselves.imo, ccp should nerf nap trains, because having 0.0 effectively owned by two large naps is bad for the game. even if the problem is ""player driven"".-liang"
5/28/2010,"nap trains aren't really a mechanics issue. they're emergent behaviour. we see them in rl for exactly the same reason we see them in eve.edit: i'm not saying i like nap trains, only that i dont see how ccp can do much about them without radically restricting player freedom. add small-gang objectives? sure i guess, that will help some. but it will only make small groups a little more attractive, not actually disincentivise naping. you will need a very strict mechanism to penalise large groups. concord charge alliances 1 mill a day for every blue that's +10? yeah, all that happens is we get ""resets"" and people use oog apps or temp blues some such. any conceivable system will get gamed. it's a player problem. we have huge nap trains because we collectively want them."
5/28/2010,"the thing about it is that using oog apps or temp blues or whatever is inconvenient, and will discourage its use. i think ultimately its easier to just get on the nap train and blue people you've never even talked to than it is to risk any sort of incident.having a hard number of blue slots (not terribly high and not terribly low) and an arbitrary number of red slots might at least encourage the behavior. ccp could also use the treaties system, and force people to only be blue in certain regions or something. they could also eliminate the need altogether like they did with wormhole space.i'm beginning to think that wh space is what 0.0 should have been. outside of the fact that i really dislike sleepers and the inability to do anything solo in a wh, i think its where i rightly belong.-liang"
5/28/2010,"* barrier to entry. new and independent alliances find it near-impossible to take and hold sov.don't agree on this. renting is a great way to learn the 0.0 way of life, and subsequently after this (you get a feeling for the amount of isk that is required to sustain .0 presence) you can scout for unused territory.* (super)cap blobbing. what role should there be for smaller gangs?there is enough small roaming stuff to do, supercap blobbing is cta wise, usually combined with sov / pos warfare.* incentives to make players actually live in 0.0 space.i rat, roam, die and awake in .0.* no real empire-building, means to develop space is very limited and expensive.holding space shouldn't be a walk in the park with a blanc check. about developing space, you can upgrade your system, rat/mine/invent/produce/roam, what else is there in eve?* mega-alliances still holding too much space?fix the grid/traffic lag - once that is tackled large fights will happen and space will start to change ownership.--now with all due respect. do you even life in .0? because i'm under the impression you are trying to care-bear proof it. .0 is for the big boys, don't like mean and grief? stay in .5+"
5/28/2010,i think limiting blues with ingame means will just lead to out of game apps to track the reds/blues. of course you might have more upsets for accidental friendly fire. but i doubt it will solve the problem.up to c3 you can do site solo even in a hac (zealot or cerb for me) or a t3 cruiser. for stuff above it really helps to have a good numbers in your timezone.
5/28/2010,"the issue with alliances making money is seriouscurrently the pirate detection array does add anomalies but most pilots will avoid half the anoms generated because they are the low end and not very time / benefit effective, the sanctums and havens at the top end are okay as are the hubs being reasonable but it might help if as well as generating better anomalies each level of pirate detection array bias's the generated anoms towards its top endso when an alliance has managed to freighter out the pirate 5, rather than simply getting 2 sanctums and 2 havens almost permanently the numbers are more like out of 20 anomalies in system 4-5 sanctums and 4-8 havens with a few hubs and lower mixed in, then the pirate 4 would out of 16 or so anoms generate 2-3 havens, 3-6 hubs and a mix of the lowersthis would help make it more viable to have more and more people in a single system,though some will complain that bounties in anomalies arnt high enough as well to compete with level 4 missions but id personally just like to see more of the usable anomalies per system that would make a one or two system holding alliance more viable"
5/28/2010,why is this thread in this subforum? we have a features & ideas discussions subforum for this stuff.
5/28/2010,"i too approve of wh space. i think the great thing about it is that it demonstrates that we can have more than one set of conditions for non-empire space.i dont suppose you recall a thread of mine from long, long ago...? some very nice ideas were put forth in that thread. in fact arguably it kicked off the w-space concept in the first place (bonus points for spotting the surprise originator of that idea)more discussion along those lines would be more fruitful than asking ccp to impose arbitrary limits on how many friends or enemies players can have."
5/28/2010,"i think there should be more interesting ways to improve your space. the current upgrades only improve the way you can make money. granted you might have to first nerf 0.0 to make some of the more interesting upgrades viable.disclaimer: these ideas are not final ideas. still, personally i'd like to see something like:- connect local to an upgrade. first remove local from 0.0. and in turn give 0.0 alliances an upgrade to reinstate local in a system.- give us defensive upgrades, maybe gate guns?- an upgrade to do a scan sweep once in a while to sniff out cloakers.- maybe an upgrade to give you info on what ships are in system.- for us rpers a propaganda upgrade that automatically sends a 'welcome' message when a pilot enters the system.- give us some windowdressing upgrades that let us display the sov holder logo at the gates/stations.- maybe make some upgrades unique. meaning that you can only have one kind of special upgrade per system.- give us the option to let neutrals use jbs for a fee and without a pw.basically alter the way a system behaves. think outside of isk per hour. make the different empires the players build different.and again, those ideas where just from the top of my head and not proposals that should be taken literally."

5/28/2010,"not nearly as minor as you think. not about realism, either, but about keeping up a believable illusion of it. things such as this seriously break the immersion for me, and i guess for many others, too. if it is not changed now, it likely never will and this will hamper later efforts to expand eve in this direction."
5/28/2010,ccp: now is the time.
5/28/2010,ccp already consulted some scientific experts at the behest of many people on the test servers. i doubt they will give those guys another call
5/28/2010,"which systems/planets appear to be ""wrong""?the worlds i've seen so far seem to make sense - lava planets inside, ice/gas planets outside, temperate in the middle."
5/28/2010,"i went and checked 4 random systems in my current neighbourhood:attyn, channace, tourier and annanake (sp?)attyn and tourier both had barren outermost planets at orbits of around 23 au. both showed temperatures of around 300k. i'd expect ice planets around there with temperatures close to 20k.channace iii is a barren planet, too. this might surprise as it is 82000km in radius (about twice the volume of jupiter, iirc). of course, it's surface gravity is ... 0g. last but not least, its orbit distance is, peculiarly, 0, too! further planets in the system show very similar values.number 4 was ok.that is 3 out of 4 with problems, one of them outright broken. they won't be the only ones. if planets are colonized in this state, i expect some odditites might be found that do not just have immersion related (""cosmetic"" for a certain mindset) issues but actual balance problems.really not sure what these astrophysicists did there..."
5/28/2010,maybe it's hollow?
5/28/2010,"unfortunately, i don't know if we can expect ccp to go and fix all those planets in time.but i would support fixing whatever they can to create more illusion of realism."
5/28/2010,"the new icons for corp logos may be nice in a way, but for some layouts they just look crappy.would be nice to get the old ones back in so we are able to restore the corp logos to their original look.fly safehb"
5/28/2010,you are talking like a two year old so i wouldn't be talking
5/28/2010,no.
5/28/2010,"also: binary systems. i know that somewhere in eve-lore it states that, technically, all gated systems are binary, but it would be cool to actually see the other star. especially if they are different. (e.g. red dwarf + blue giant)"

5/28/2010,"simple idea. after coming back from a four month vaca' and having to pack my ships and have all the gear pooled together being annoying. it would be nice to have the gear packaged by ship name, and then have the ability to drag that package onto the ship to have it auto fit when you get to your new home.thoughts?"
5/28/2010,"1. save fitting2. repackage ship3. haul stuff to new destination4. assemble ship5. go to fitting screen6. load and apply the fittingthis works already.also when you have been gone longer: the limits for courier contracts got increased from 120,000m3 to 981,000m3. that means you can carry even rigged battleships in freighters now when you are using a courier contract. might save you some isk on the rigs when the route is somewhat safe."
5/28/2010,"in the overall scheme of things, this is a rather minor issue, but it happens enough to me to be rather annoying. i'd like to see the period that you have to wait to reconnect to lost probes be reduced to, say, 2 minutes, from the current 5.it's happened enough to me that i've forgotten to recall probes within a system, but i may not realize it until several jumps later, and i'm not entirely sure *where* the probes are. i usually know the general area, though. as such, i'm often stuck waiting 15 minutes just to check the three systems where my probes could be.i'm assuming this is some kind of server issue, but i don't see entirely what a 5 minute cool off accomplishes that a two minute timer can't. i, for one, can't imagine that all that many people really spam the ""reconnect to lost probes button"". as such, and for my ease of mind next time i lose probes, i'd like to see a reduction of the timer, or at least an explanation for why it's so long. thank you."
5/28/2010,"add a ""reconnecting"" status with a countdown on the probes tab of the scanner. this would avoid any possible leaving dead probes behind to probe out people in a short amount of time while allowing people to know if their wayward probes are actually in system with them!"

5/28/2010,"i'm not even going to offer a proposal here, i'm going to just explain why i'm so ****ed.you create a patch without thorough testing. pi comes in and now it's so ****ing borked, large towers that used to cost 400 mil cost 40 mil million to make, outpost that cost 15 bil cost 4 bil. not because of player driven markets, but because of poor testing on the npc seeded **** that can be reprocessed for parts. it's not even about the money, it's about what used to be vs what is now the unintended effect. people are literally building 100s of large towers atm because of your **** up. they're building tons of outpost because of your **** up. and quite honestly, how do you fix this mistake w/o a rollback.about the only blessing i have shooting any pos atm is that i know some dumb ******* probably gtc'd 400 mil to buy it along the chain of isk in this game. but now there's not even that saving grace of the disaster that is 0.0. obviously this was unintended. obviously something needs to happen, but i don't even know what to do. do you unleash banhammer hell on people because your own sorry qa department couldn't see the issues. one thing's for sure, it's day 2 and this is already 1 of many things that are obviously wrong in this patch. sort your **** ccp."
5/28/2010,i was actually looking forward to pi and was going to go into p4 product manufacturing but now it's absolutely pointless
5/28/2010,"what, you don't like outposts at 5 bil a piece, or fully equipped large deathstar poses at 100 mil ? and what do you mean, pi should bring in more than 10 mil isk per day with two hours of daily work ?screw pi, we never wanted those planets anyway nah, just kidding. fix this asap."
5/28/2010,no even better gallente vs. caldarior maybe we could just put solitary on there.oh those are both on my computer.if you want those games just go to facebook or myspace
5/28/2010,"opensocial should be on evegate from the start, it's the norm for any modern social network.ccp are in bed with ms so they probably can't install apache shindig.with opensocial tools such as killboards, mining apps, calendars and all the extra stuff could be community developed without us having to wait 2-3 years for ccp to come back and finish features.clunky api keys system would be a thing of the past with oauth."

5/28/2010,"most of the thread's been alts, pro and con.the campaign against ankh is using a lot of conjecture and digging up posts that are over 2 years old. people's perception of things changes, they wisen up and opinions can be altered.anyway my points from #26 stand."
5/28/2010,this is pretty funny actually. most of this anti-anhk stuff is pretty bs.did anyone bother to see the fw fix pro-pvp assembly hall thread proposal by anhk? sounds like ya'll got seriously trolled.
5/28/2010,did you bother to read the iceland meeting minutes in which ccp responded to our question of 'will you ever fix faction warfare' with 'no'. ankh just started three threads there on topics as genuine as possible and i doubt not that if any of them ever gets addressed by ccp she will claim to have had a hand in it.
5/28/2010,did it happened ? and if yes i wait impatiently the meeting minutes regards
5/28/2010,the meeting was postponed. i was hoping it would be rescheduled but i suspect it is unlikely now that the csm5 delegates have been announced. the next meeting will therefore be the handover from csm4 to csm5 shortly after june 3rd.
5/28/2010,"game designer is but one of many qualifications for csm. you would also need interpersonal skills and the realization of the purpose of eve. which is, to meld pve into pvp in such a way that it attempts to please everyone.i believe it is that last part that the tribune is against.but anyway, any news source can be unbiased and be biased at the same time. it all depends on who rights the articles. the tribune offered for anyone to write a counter article to theirs. it isn't their fault no one took them up on the offer."
5/28/2010,quoting this because lol
5/28/2010,this thread just reinforces my belief that ankh succeeded in seriously trolling jps.
5/29/2010,it's a great idea.the programmers need to get away from their anal attachment to drop down tables. this isn't a hobbit cave anymore guys- get into the 21st century!!! it should all be visual- tip- copy the us and uk armies on how they fly their drones nowadays...
5/29/2010,"instead we get overview refreshing every 3 seconds now. anyway, supported."
5/29/2010,"like one of the posters said, we did have this at one time as trails and they should definitely be reinstated."
5/29/2010,great idea yank!!orion shadowmaker
5/29/2010,good lord this would be awesome
5/29/2010,do want.
5/29/2010,"this is a great idea, as people said, the trails are wanted back."
5/29/2010,"i agree that if it's just velocity vectors (not proportional to tactical gird) it's better to leave them more or less intact while zooming. but (if possible) having more information than ""he goes that way and looks faster than the next guy"" (i know you can check actuall velocity in overview, but still) would be nice. something like distance traveled in 10s +/- should be visible enough, i think (that really depends on ship type, ofc)... but doesn't really matter as long as we'll have something.i just hope that if it's ever implemented vectors won't be white... or at least visible enough. and having small icons for every ship hull (like the one we have for capsule) would be nice too."
5/29/2010,"great idea. supported. sadly i dont think anything will ever happen, its not the first nor 25th time it was suggested, and every single time it was greeted with unanimous player support.please ccp, make useless tactical overlay useful."

5/29/2010,either make it a 10 or 15% bonus to kinetic to compensate for racial resists or change it to something else like the suggestions from the op.
5/29/2010,im for laying the skills out like the kestrel it gets extra damage to kin but still gets a boost for outer damage types as well so it encourages you to use kin ammo but doesn't make your skills uselessjust tack a 3% bonus to all outer damage types to the current skills and see how it pans out

5/29/2010,"many good, specific suggestions in this proposal and good job linking to associated threads for easy reference."
5/29/2010,support every ui chance suggested and would encourage you to continue adding to the list.

5/29/2010,"if you bring folders back, please do it right this time: if i move something to a folder, the only copy of this item should reside in that folder, not in the root and the folder."
5/29/2010,"totally agree with the op. ccp, please bring back the ability to create folders for our contact list.actually, as things are at the moment, the so called contact list is now acting simply as a ""standings list""as such, this makes evegate, imo pretty much useless. evegate also needs more filtering options, eg :- ""online/offline/all"", (not simply in the ""watchlist"", but by a persons on/offline status). there is bound to be other filtering that others can recomend also. please ccp, fix the contacts list."
5/29/2010,folders!want. back. now.

5/29/2010,bump. totally. how hard can this be?how many alliance members want their logo on it? i'd hazard a guess at pretty much all of them.
5/29/2010,"we followed all the rules and still no logo. if your process is still broken, don't go telling us ""it's fixed now"".and if it's not broken, where's our logo?"

5/29/2010,"they're too busy rushing together their next crappy, incomplete, game-breaking expansion."
5/29/2010,hallan told me to support this
5/29/2010,supported. alliances have been waiting way too long for this.
5/29/2010,supporting the idea of getting our identity .
5/29/2010,noirdot also want to know where the hell our logo went. fix it
5/29/2010,kind of indicative of everything else ccp try in this game. half assed then neglected :(
5/29/2010,"first impressions from tyrannis regarding sound :- jukebox seems fixed.- artillery seems fixed.- incomming fire seems fixed.- issues when entering a mission seems fixed.not much detail regarding most of these on the patch notes, but stealth fixes are fixes nonetheless.so for me, 2 big issues have been fixed ( not hearing artillery and incomming fire ).still a big issue is still open : not hearing explosions.i just destroyed a slave pen, which had an explosion so big that my whole screen was filled, but could not hear a thing !so i am still advocating for an option where we can turn off positional sound.i will update the op later on after some more testing."
5/29/2010,i like that and what if the npc could be played by players just like in lotr mmo
5/29/2010,"so by your logic, the riskless profession of afk macro mining should be jazzed up too? how about we take out all tanking ability of mining barges, hell, exhumers too just to keep them on their toes? sounds great and i'll definitely have tons of fun!"
5/29/2010,i don't see why not.
5/29/2010,"awesome. mining ships never needed a tank since they're meant to mine, not tank anyway."
5/29/2010,"uh... what? what are you even talking about here? please explain how you got that from what i said? i'm not seeing the connection.i mean, are you seriously opposing making part of a game more fun?"
5/29/2010,"note that i was agreeing with the 'jazzed up' bit, not the 'remove tank' bit."
5/29/2010,apparently.
5/29/2010,"u just don't get it--think about it. mining is boring and riskless. that's why i'm talking about making part of a game more fun in same way u want it to be--by removing all the tank from exhumers. that way, risk vs reward applies and there will never be a dull moment for the miners. call it an addition to this topic's proposal if u will. do u understand now? but as u can see, it's exactly what will ""jazz up"" your eve experience."
5/29/2010,"i agree the ui is often cumbersome, annoying, quirky, non-intuitive, difficult to use, irritatingly fiddly, and unnecessarily redundant. i agree it needs work to correct those things. however, ""revamp the whole ui once and for all"" is too nebulous to support. that nebulosity is reflected in your ""needed"" list, which ranges all over the place from redesigning global elements (menu replacement with buttons) to new features (customizable ui and clipboard-like lists) to changes to specific features (hot keys support, font, redundancy on menus) to things ccp has already said cannot be changed (differentiating bpo icons from bpc icons) and yet is not a comprehensive list by far. a revamp of the whole ui would need to cover much more territory. furthermore, the categorical changes you suggested don't address the need to streamline all those cumbersome tasks in eve that involve too many clicks, too many steps, and too many show-stopping obstacles that are completely unnecessary--which i believe any comprehensive ui overhaul would need to address to be truly beneficial. for those reasons, i suggest it's better to break out ui fix proposals in a more modular way, with each proposal covering a given area (global fixes, market window overhaul, pos management overhaul, contracts overhaul, etc.). focused discussion for a given area of the ui is not only likely to yield a more coherent, on-track discussion, it is more likely to attract experts whose feedback is very valuable.of course, all that involves some hard work. first, it makes sense to find related proposals so you don't duplicate effort. however, finding them in the turbulent quagmire that is ah is a chore. then it makes sense to research evelopedia to see what csm has already proposed and what has disappeared into the the mystical backlog of infinite holding. so a good, well-researched, informed proposal takes a lot of effort. but without that effort, all we do is end up doing is spinning the same old **** in non-specific threads like this. ccp demonstrated with the fitting window that they are capable of wonderfully functional ui design that also looks cool and is fun (or at least non-frustrating) to interact with. i'd love for the whole game to reflect that same quality. but doing so would be a monumental task and in lots of cases, require touching code that no one wants to go near. not really an excuse for avoidance but given the crushing weight of other stuff in the fix list, understandable. ""status of ui fixes in the backlog"" will be on the discussion list for the csm5 summit in june. if we can get some insight on that, i think we have a better chance of assessing a realistic approach to proposing comprehensive ui overhauls. meanwhile, there are a lot of smaller fixes already proposed and active in ah that could use and should get support (many related to the list provided in the op)."
5/29/2010,"i dont think you get good results by making lot of small changes, you need some large changes to entire ui."
5/29/2010,"unfortunately, mynxee, the problems with the ui have as much to do with its poor architecture and code layout (and no, i've not seen either--but having seen the state of the ui i can deduce it). so it seems plausible that to actually redesign the ui would also require a full-scale refactoring of the entire ui code, which is frankly already outdated. they're better off just burning the thing down and starting over."
5/29/2010,"mynxee, bringing small issues to ccp has proven to be ineffective in the past two years, when ccp does not want to touch the fundamental problems they rely on. ccp also stated repeatedly that they want generic ""big picture"" issues where they can fill in the technical details, and not dozens of specific small issues.the ui is fundamentally broken and needs to be reworked from the ground up. raising small specific issues will not work as those are band-aid fixes and will have to be torn down as well as soon as ccp realizes they need to redo the entire ui from scratch."
5/29/2010,"i like the idea of making the sisi client freely moddable, with players then being able to submit those mods to ccp for approval. put proposed mods out there for the dogs to sniff, and if they pass the ""how can i exploit this"" test then incorporate them into the options for the main client."
5/29/2010,the only thing i want changed about the ui is i want a bit more flash and fanfare.
5/29/2010,fo schizzle.
5/29/2010,"agreed. i'd like to get a bit more information about how contested system x is.too exploitable. we'd find a way, eventually.consequences to system occupancy? losers would just quit/switch sides.no thumbs up this time, too much too soon."
5/29/2010,"this is the most important thing regarding fw. i can live with or work around bugs, as annoying as they are. i can live with ""no real effect"" occupancy quite well (and, as unfamed noted, effects can easily lead to the wrong reaction; incentives to make the ""losing"" side more attractive need to be there). all of that i can deal with.but as it is pretty much mandatory to control post-dt plexing, i can pretty much ignore any possible participation in fw outside of long holidays. dt is during my working hours, i can not be in the game then.it's the source of endless frustration.quick summary for those who don't know:when a fw plex is captured, it respawns in a given area, like exploration sites. except that, say, an amarr complex that spawns in a minmatar-occupied system can not be found anymore.in the situation where there is only one amarr system in the middle of a number of minmatar-controlled systems - say, they capture a single system in minmatar space - that would lead to an empty amarr system until the plexes expire from age. to prevent that, ccp runs a script every downtime to ""reshuffle"" those ""inaccessible"" complexes.that means that every dt, such ""island systems"" will be repopulated with plexes, but likely remain empty as soon as those are captured, until the next dt. this means that if you can't be there post-dt, you won't be able to participate in most of the key fights and battles of fw."
5/29/2010,"the actual plexes are great - and can be a great way to get pvp. the reason they currently suck is that 1) they are full of npcs so people often use a pve fit, and 2) is the other militia doesn't know when you are doing them! so people tend to try to do them with the hope of not being found. they fit a fast ship and if the enemy happens to stumble in on them they will warp off instead of fight. if there were no npcs and you knew the other side was put on notice as to where you are doing a plex people would use actual pvp fits and do the plex with the intention of getting pvp. right now we do get some pvp in and around plexes but the npcs tend to ruin it. and of course, since you don't know when or where people are doing plexes you are just flying around with your fingers crossed hoping to find an enemy. which is just a waste of time that could be better spent in pvp. then when you do find them in the current system chances are they will just warp off because they were hoping not to be found. i dont blame people because the mechanics are set up to encourage this behavior. but if you do away with the npcs and just let the other militia know then people would do plexes for the pvp. the missions can be left for pve but the actual plexes should be taken by pvp."
5/29/2010,+1 for op to do a thread like this. some things you say about the fixes to fw just doesn't make any sense or it just wrong and don't even fix the main problem.from what i hear from other players (gallente or any other faction) is the blob. the major uber 
5/29/2010,"fixing plexes so that we can - pvp instead of primarily pve in them- have them spawn equally in all timezoneswould go a long way to solving the above:a plex will a) force a certain hull size, a great way to split up blobsb) get people off stations/gatesc) they are most efficiently run when you can do them with one person each - that splits up blobs like nothing else if people would actually care about capturing plexes/systems (hint: give rewards!)"
5/29/2010,"supported, but i might make the menu:view market detailsmodify orderlocationshow info----------cancel orderreasons: when you're going through your orders, you almost always first view the details, then modify the order, so this reduces total mouse move distance (since you don't always change an order) and is an operations order hint.adding a menu separator would be a good thing too (lots of eve menus would benefit). it increases the distance to the ""dangerous"" menu items and is a visual separator between safe and dangerous option."
5/29/2010,seems reasonable.

5/29/2010,they all but stated that stations were there to be found.
5/29/2010,"skotia, i believe your issue is that when you set a waypoint to the gate to b in system a, you're setting a waypoint in system a, not b. a bit confusing, but expected behavior.i support this proposal; it's bothered me in the past that there isn't a semantic difference between ""set destination"" and ""set waypoint"". a very common use for waypoints is ""pick up stuff in systems a, b, c and d, and get them to system e, and often you can't do this with the current system, for example if your destination is your current system."
5/29/2010,"a few minor graphical issues.okay, i'd like to bring to the councils attention three small graphical issues that could be easily fixed (as far as i am aware) and would make a great deal of differences to the beauty of the eve universe.the first issue is ships overlapping as they exit stations in busy areas, such as in jita where you'l often undock to find your ship ""inside"" another. this phenomenon could be reduced significantly just by having two or more starting points for ships to leave the station from. to clarify, at the moment everyone undocks at the same spot and so you see a streight line of ships leaving from a specific point. if there were two of these points you would have two queues leaving the sation but less overlap between ships.the second issue is one that has been bugging me for a while now. if two ships are stationary, and firing at each other, then the point of impact of the projectiles is constant, and always hits the same spot, over and over. this just seems unrealistic to me. if there were some variation in where the projectiles hit on the ships hull it would make battle look alot more realistic. the new tyrannis tailer has some footage of fighter bommers bombing a titan, and the bombs hit in multiple places to show some beautiful explosions cascade across the titan's hull, which just doesn't happen in eve thus far, they all hit the same spot (it seems to be the closest point on the ships hull to you).the third issue is a very minor one, and i would hardly call it a priority, but i will talk about it anyway. stark shadows cast on the ship are currently jagged and obviously pixelated. i dont know if this would be easy to fix, but it would look alot nicer if it was.that's all i really have to say. please respond so i can get other players views on this topic. thank you.arduemont."

5/29/2010,"on that note dear god the sidebar should have actual text, not images. i searched for eve gate and didn't find it. also what in god's name is that link doing all the way down there if you want people to actually use it?!"
5/29/2010,"i think i qualify as an active and engaged eve player who spends a fair amount of time on these forums. it seriously took me five minutes of looking to find the link buried at the bottom of the ... menu? wtf?! put an evegate link at the top of right hand sidebar, above the (does-anyone-really-use-it-more-than-once?!) search box where it will be easily visible and accessible."
5/29/2010,"wow, i didn't even notice they'd added the link to the menu. one would think a big addition to the latest expansion would receive more priority than third from the bottom."
5/29/2010,this is a thing that has been bothering me for a while when i want to train a new skill i need to look though the skill and find the highest level for each skill in there because it is listed about 3 times and verys the level for each onefor instance torpedo specprerequisites tabit needs 4 skillsstranded missiles 3heavy missiles 3missile operation 4torpedoes 5however missile operation is listed 4 times at all 4 levels and on skills and with more required skills the redundancy gets confusing. for instance large blaster speculation has the skill gunnery listed 9 times at levels 2-5 all i want is cutting off the lower levels and repeats of skills. so we get a neat and orderly list of required skills rather then searching for the highest level of each skill.
5/29/2010,"i partly agree with you, i don't think that ccp should remove all the instances of missile launcher operation in the list because it helps show the prereqs to the prereqs at a glance.however, they should clean up skills like that one under ""primary skills"" and make the whole thing primary, there is no point to it being there as it is a prereq to the rest of the skills and it is already shown but it doesn't show that at this point."
5/29/2010,"personally, i like seeing the tree. but i'd be fine with an option to view it in tree mode or in list mode."
5/29/2010,"here are some things that might help to spread out mission runners in high-sec and at the same time, get those people or new ones in low sec.in high-sec: - agents gives missions 1-3 jumps away. never the same system. this approach will lower the load on a given system and probably load at ccp servers. payout is 10% increased because of that. from reward to bounty. seems fair enough.- you can talk to your agent remotely, just like in the epic arc missions. this means go to a dead end system where theres no one and do your mission there as long as its in the same region as your agent is.in low sec :- agents gives mission in same system. no travel increases chance of getting more mish runners here.- rewards are increased 30% including bounty. that seems fair but it could increase.- you can talk to your agent remotely, no need to go in stationagent standings: - from -20 to +10: all the agents (level 4 and 5, lvl3 ?)will be in high sec and mission destination will be in high sec. - from +11 to +20: all agetns will be in low-sec (lvl4 and 5) will give missions in low secthe isk payout from high-sec to low sec will have to be changed and since we now what agents gives x mission and x system it should make ccp easier to say this agent gives better payout for those who are in low sec and less in high-sec. that seems pretty straigh forward.that was the ""quick"" fix. the long fix which i would like to be implemented is the new ai in every mission. but if thats the case, the isk payout would have to be increased because of the risk involved"
5/29/2010,"i have done a bit of a survey today (using cribba eve agents).gallente have 89 l4 q20 agents in low sec/0.0, caldari 5 (all from expert distribution btw). the fun part is that the 81 out of 89 galletne agents are from division giving out a lot of courier missions and only 8 from combat divisions and some station get four level 4 q20 courier agents all in the same station.caldari get 1 combat agents out of 5 in and the best station has 3 agent (2 courier 1 combat). gallente low sec mission hubs seem custom made for isk farmers working for rtm rings (and probably is the reason why most of the courier missions are done for gallente corps). the whole distribution of agents need to be redone. sadly i agree with malcanis that it will be mostly a cosmetic change. we really need someone in the csm to push for changes in the pve part of the game. i think that the guys saying ""working on pve? horror, ccp should work for pvp first and exclusively"" are damaging not only the pve players but themselves too as the current implementation in missions, mission scanning, npc behaviour and so on train player to avoid any chance of doing pvp while doing pve as it automatically mean failure (note necessarily destruction but at least sharply decreased efficiency). the problem is that, especially when doing something about pve, ccp first decide what is the source of problem, then what is the solution, then search for the proof that the source of the problem is the one they have already chosen, disregarding any different data.so the ""solution"" always fit perfectly to the ""perceived"" source of the problem, but rarely to the real source of the problem. hoping for some better development in this part of the game,/supported"
5/29/2010,"i also believe that if ccp makes mission runners in low sec a bit harder to get probed out only in low sec that would encourage them to go in low sec. not impossible but just harder that is.for example, you would need more than 4 probes to successfully get a 100% scan strenght instead of the easy 3-4 probes like now. this method takes less than 2 minutes with good experience."

5/29/2010,"we should punish the wealthy and reward the lazy and useless, i am a pod who doesnt wish to do any work and instead get paid via a yulai policy which takes isk directly from the filthy rich 0.0 alliances who have made it far and instead pay me and every other person who doesnt wish to obtain his / her own isk.this game is no longer about warfare and barbaric grudges, nc and sc have decided that since both coalitions are identical in both skill (blobbing) and power (napping people) that they will band together and form a ec (eden coalition).this new change will affect everyone so i propose we introduce a tax that only affects the wealthy and rewards the poor.the following new features should be implemented based on this idea.1. new and poor players to get free pod and medical upgrades2. new and poor players to get isk on a weekly basis depending on how much they earn3. all expenses should be cut by 50% for new and poor players4. rich players to have 40% of all their income stripped from them to help poor players5. equal opportunities in 0.0, meaning alliances / corps are at risk of getting banned if they harm people not in their coalition.6. benefits and tax breaks for those who wish to reproduce in incarnai will add more to this but know this would be an excellent addition to the game, i am certain ankh would agree too"
5/29/2010,"i like the idea of the weekly pay for newer players. but, 0.0 space is the corp/alliance's own area if someone comes into their territory they have killing rights i think. and taxing the older and more wealthy players is not right. if someone wants to help another person with their isk problems they would but most people will be very unhappy with that type of tax.mork"

5/29/2010,"given how many eve players are physically incapable of getting pregnant, it's a risk i'm willing to take."
5/29/2010,is there a way to make this thread receive more attention?
5/29/2010,"not without attracting a lot of unwanted attention i'm afraid. if you want a constructive discussion, just wait a bit and/or personally talk with other people who have experience with the ship."
5/29/2010,-1 high+1 midmini zealotjob done.
5/29/2010,"firstly, i don't think ccp has any real desire to kill large-scale fights and complicated political power plays like some individuals in this thread might believe. if they actually did prefer small-timer pvp and operations, they would have divided this server into parts and given us battlegrounds, just like the other awful horrible disgusting mmos out there. otherwise why put everyone on one server? also, driving the current 0.0 alliances into poverty by forcing them to spend even more isk on empire-building (which would also lead to more barriers of entry!) or nerfing passive incomes is not going to get other (smaller) alliances into 0.0 space. lastly, naps are always temporary, and very fluid. and extremely exaggerated."
5/29/2010,"another f&i thread by ankhit is pretty obvious that empire can easily claim 0.0, the cycle on how this game works is lost on some though.i cant stand blobbing however with the insurance changes on supercaps people will be affected by the loss of one, it is still easy to build an empire from empire and working your way upto 0.0.the only thing i see going wrong is people rushing from empire to 0.0 they assume some success in lowsec means they can handle 0.0 warfare.theres so many examples but so far the only alliance that ever was lucky enough to succeed was pl when they beat bruce.all that needs to be changed is management and lagg, napfests can easily be created in lowsec / empire and while experience is limited any alliance can make in work in their favour take a look at goons for example worst alliance ever full of useless pilots however they achieved alot more stuff than any other alliance.if you want 0.0, just think, plot and plan, do not change the mechanics pos warfare was changed to add a isk sink on sov and i guess limit repetitive warfare, dominion despite its problems has made it easier for people to conquer space in 0.0 sadly everyone wants to go against the most skilled alliance (if any) and get demoralised instantly.0.0 alliance leaders are pathetic tbh, none of them have balls todo anything with a nap so your best bet is to stage a coup using empire to purge ****ty alliances, they are some really great alliances that dont deserve to be called pets and some ****ty blobbing ones that could easily be nuked.tldr  you want 0.0 go for it, plan correct and assault, it is as simple as that but who really has balls and intelligence to do that"
5/29/2010,"my idea is to make a lottery system like in real life. the first level of the lottery can be a small ticket not needing slot of money. say about 50,000 isk is the max you can win with 1 ticket that costs 10,000 isk. you have the same chances as a real lottery. with this one ticket you can earn between nothing to 100,000. 100,000 being the max you could win. it can go on like this for how ever many levels as you want it to go. but, the extra money that the players losses goes into a bigger jackpot. depending on how mutch isk comes from the state and the normal taxes that are sent to the jackpot every time it resets, also (as i've said earlier) extra isk from the lottery tickets determans how mutch the players can win in the jackpot. for the jackpot players may only buy i ticket for 5,000,000 isk. the jackpot will automaticly choose a random set of numbers and which ever player guesses correctly will win the pot. but, if no one wins the pot then it will roll over to the next jackpot. the jackpot drawings will be between 1-2 weeks apart.thanks for reading and please leave your coments. i may or may not make changes to this.mork"
5/29/2010,"um, great. go do it. you don't need to bring this to the attention of the csm or ccp. there have been player run lotteries going on for years."
5/29/2010,well the way i'm looking at it it wil be universe wide and i just don't know if players can go to that type of scale.
5/29/2010,"i get what you're saying, something that is ccp run so that its trusted and lots of people buy in.but that would potentially kill the mini profession that is sleezy player run lotteries, although that could be a good thing seeing as theres hundreds of them.i like the word eve-wide.-t'amber"
5/29/2010,at most there should be a way to advertise your lottery more. currently its forum only and spamming local. the ability to buy slots on the login screen and bilboards would be nice but no ccp ran lottery plz
5/29/2010,what if ccp made a item that players can buy in bulk to where they can do their own lotteries for their corps. that way ccp will have a way to be apart of it yet it is still player run. hows that? and for the jackpot the players that are running the little lotteries can use like a corp bank or just another bank to store the isk (if they are trusted) and have it go that way. there are many different ways this can go.

5/30/2010,+1 we need this
5/30/2010,great idea
5/30/2010,"this is a proposal to ask ccp to evaluate their attitude towards eve development and truly commit to developing excellent features instead of half-finished ones.this years slogan of ccp was excellence. they made posters and videos about it, and proudly displayed it at fanfest. but for a company claiming to be dedicated to excellence, their eve-development does not reflect this. in fact, excellence is sacrificed time and time again to the big god of the release schedule and new features.there are several examples of this lack of commitment to excellence:* ccp introduced factional warfare, but introduced it full of bugs and with game design that was shaky at best. and ever since introducing it have given it almost no extra (and much needed) development time and after care.* dominion and treaties. dominion introduced a scalable, iterative system that would allow them to extend it and improve it. no improving has happened in the past 6 months. even worse, the treaties we were promised seem to have vanished, and reliable sources indicate the treaties development team was re-assigned to work on planetary interaction. * the tyrannis introduction. pos's shooting blues and a complete screw up of the pi materials market. both problems were predicted weeks before the release by players and i would honestly be surprised if nobody in ccps qa department considered it. yet nothing was done in time resulting in the massive screw up that happened post release.so what is excellence?excellence is to go beyond what is merely 'good' or 'adequate'. in game design, it means adding features and extra's that arent stricktly required to make something playable, but make it more fun. this is illustrated by the following graphic:www.mindsoup.org/stuff/excellence.pngas is common in software development, there is a subset of features that is sufficient to make something release-ready. some features are more important than others, and the core features are usually identified at the start of development as 'must haves'.if it turns out that the development team may not have enough time, less important features ('could haves' and 'should haves' mostly) get cut. this way you can still meet your deadline with a functional product. however, as we established above, the minimum is never the same as excellence, because excellence is more than the bare minimum by definition.unfortunately, it seems ccp are content to stop development on a feature when that feature is released. even though parts of it got inevitably cut due to time constraints. this means they have not yet reached excellence. this proposal requests that ccp establish at the start of develpment at which point that feature is 'excellent'. this (by definition) includes more features than the core 'must haves' to make it release-ready. although they can still release it when it reaches 'release-ready', they should continue development until that point of 'excellence' is reached. this does mean features will require more development time (and therefore money), but if you want to be truly excellent, that is the price you pay.maybe some ritalin tooin addition to ccp being willing to settle for stuff that is just adequate, they are also easily distracted by new shiny things. we can see this when the treaties were shelved in favour of planetary interaction, and when factional warfare received no attention after it was released. the planners of ccp's development seem to run from one shiny new feature to the next like a kid on adhd.ccp will need to re-evaluate how much time is spent on old content and making that excellent, and how much time is spent on new features. because due to eve's competitive, single shard nature, small problems in various features may cascade and amplify eachother into big problems across the game. (cont.)"
5/30/2010,"(cont.) it is important that old features are excellent before it is too late and we're covered in a huge pile of broken, half finished content.is ccp's frantic release schedule to blame?are 6 months really enough time to develop new features and improve old features and fix bugs? while it is awesome to get two free expansions a year, isn't ccp risking quality in order to maintain quantity? perhaps a release schedule of 9 months per expansion (so 2 expansions every year and half) will give them more time to develop existing features into excellence, as well as developing new features into a good release-ready state.tl;drwhat we would like ccp to consider:* continue developing features until they reach a predetermined 'excellence' level* re-evaluate the amount of time allocated to fixing/developing old content and reduce the nonchalant attitude towards re-assigning teams to shiny new content.* reconsider the total release schedule time: is it really sufficient to produce 'excellent' quality game design?"
5/30/2010,yes please.
5/30/2010,"supported, but i really will be surprised if ccp pay any attention to it.they claim to be 50/50 split on developing new content and expanding old content, but it's getting increasingly hard to see where and what they are updating."
5/30/2010,"supported.i would even go so far as to say: ""push all existing, unreleased content back (unless its a part of previously released content) until existing, previously released content is up to the ""excellent"" or ""finished"" level...""of course i'm an extremist... but i'm an eve extremist!"
5/30/2010,"supported. its hard release dates and rigid schedules that have caused companies like ea to scrap quality assurance testing in favor of ""we'll patch it after release"" and they never do.to be honest i didn't want pi, i wanted an industry update(you know what i mean)."

5/30/2010,certainly supported.
5/30/2010,"yes, please!stop ****ting on quality in order to increase quantity."
5/30/2010,"of course, pushing back new content till everything is 100% is utopic at best and rediculously insane at worst, but dedicating time to actually fix things from the past is imperative. an expansion can be absolutely fantastic, even without all too much new content, as long as it brings the outdated and faulty parts of the game to a ship-shape state.keep your promises, ccp. this game is godly by default, but even gods vanish, when the worshippers turn away.oh and just to note it: i like the tyrannis expansion a whole lot. things on my poses now actually move as they're suppsoed to be -the tower graphic and jumpsgate graphics beeing ****ed up randomly, even when both screens show the same scene, still happens though-, eve starts, loads, logs in and closes as fast as never before and it seems to run a lot more smoothly ingame. also the idea of pi (and henceforth dust) is jsut great. keep that momentum, ccp."
5/30/2010,quality > quantity./supported
5/30/2010,this lack of 'excellence' is right now the most urgent issue within eve.
5/30/2010,"definitely.eve is reaching the point where product maturity and excellence becomes more and more important. eve has always occupied a niche, but as it grows, the current ""lets bolt on more features and see how it goes"" attitude while forgetting what you already have is not responsible. compared to 9 out of 10 other mmos eve is lucky to not have had subscriber numbers decline. please ccp, make the right choices to keep up a sustainable growth on the long run, by making an excellent product."
5/30/2010,"100% supported.if ccp want to have 2 ""hey look"" headlines a year, which is a perfectly reasonable thing for an mmo company to want, then they should have 1 big new stuff expansion and one smaller ""review"" expansion where they fix, update and completeedit: ankh was right in the other, similar thread here: ccp are drawing on their credit with the playerbase with these continual half-finished, botched feature releases. soon or perhaps already, people will stop giving them the benefit of the doubt and they will have no credibility left. they will cry wolf once too often."
5/30/2010,"agreed. we need this much more than any new features. anyway, buffing afs, eafs and rockets would practically count as new content since it would make a bunch of relatively unused things viable."
5/30/2010,"i have a feeling this should be brought up in a csm meeting too tbh.definatly supported, oh and you diddnt even mentioin the terrible ui and general cleaning up of it, ie setting multiple jobs, still not possible after nearly 7 years?"
5/30/2010,"some features are more important than a release schedule, and for the long time players, its always these that get cut to meet the target date.please finish what you start, ccp!"

5/30/2010,i strongly support this proposal.
5/30/2010,"from all i've seen, this is the root cause of every fight that the csm has ever had with ccp. they want more, we want better. it's natural, given the incentives - we care most about having a game we like more, they care most about increasing the subscriber base - but it's not healthy. i think the csm has the right side of this more so than ccp does, because subscriber retention is a massive sticking point for eve. but yes, this has always been eve's biggest failing. lots of cool-seeming new stuff, but the 20% that doesn't work and the 30% that's just crap leaves a pretty bad taste in our mouths, even when we think about the other half. this needs to be solved, and it's probably the single most important thing the csm should e pushing for."

5/30/2010,"supported, if only to have my normal +3 implants suddenly act as +5s. in regard to the side discussion of 'should learning be first' i'll weigh in that i spent my first 1.5 days taking the base skills to 4 (the queue helped tremendously here), and then moved on to other things for awhile. this is despite urging from my friend (who got me into this) to head toward 5/5 when possible.of course, when i got a donation that would cover the book costs, i grabbed the four adv versions. those, until recently, were in various stages of 3/4 (i just squared away all of those to 4, almost a year later). i have no interest in l5 on most of them, for the amount of time involved i can use it better by filling out orca and rorqual support skills..."

5/30/2010,have not played much to use it but not having folders is silly. back when i did wars i used them to sort them into corps all the time.
5/30/2010,i support the op wholeheartedly.
5/30/2010,"i quite like the new contact system (standings viewable in the address book and notifications for changes), but i am also puzzled about why custom folders were removed. i would support the reinsertion of custom folders for contacts - at the very least for those who are members of the watch list."

5/30/2010,support op
5/30/2010,i got lost and confused trying to delete old contacts :(

5/30/2010,"one of the pilots in one of our war target corporations has a neutral alt with an orca. now, appropriately, neutrals who remote-repair a legitimate target become legitimate targets themselves. however, that does not hold true if a war target utilizes the ship maintenance facility on an orca to switch ships with no docking lag mid-fight. i propose that if you have kill rights on a target, and that target uses the ship maintenance facilities of an orca (or carrier, i suppose, but it's more moot in lowsec/null), kill rights should be given on the orca pilot in the same way they are currently given to neutral repairers."

5/30/2010,so some ccp noob dev has 5 minutes to spare before leaving work one day and decides to screw over one faction's missioners? i think that's how this came to be.
5/30/2010,"for the certain hull size, i hope you mean only frigs, only cruisers. that would be strange and i don't know if its a good idea but i admit its not bad.but your idea doesn't get people of gates and stations. wanna know why ? you don't have control while in a plex. you got an advantage if your at a stargate. if its too big or too strong, order your fleet to jump and poof, there gone. but in a plex, if you go there and your screwed, you stay screwed. you die and lose the fight.thats the first thing that will fix the main problem. the second about your so called pve content is probably that caldari ships are jamming the enemy. thats very easy to fix you know. in other words, that part is not even a problem.the third and last is the thing about the timezone. its false. they just have a number of spawn inside a system...thats all. don't want to insult you but inform yourself a bit...hell, talk to a dev with a petition first before posting those false facts."

5/30/2010,"right, lag specifically refers to a high ping latency. not on the fact that the server is unable to handle more than 700 players in a system at once so one group of them gets toasted before they even load grid. call it what you like - in a game of this scale it's still an utterly unacceptable performance issue.and i still find the old softimage|3d interface to be friendlier and easier to use. can't speak to that since i really can't be bothered with fw - i find it that appealing.then it's a ****ty design because taking a pve-fit ship into losec is tantamount to just self destructing it as soon as you undock.oh, where to begin?hyperion, eos, astarte, brutix, myrmidon - all so broken that people shield tank them so they can even compete in their intended role, and they still fail horribly.oneiros, exqueror, maulus, navitas, lachesis, arazu- never used except the last two which have some utility as heavy long range tacklers. of course they have to be shield tanked as well in order to compete sin, ares, enyo, kronos, diemos, maulus, navitas,- are widely regarded as awful, awful ships with ******ed bonuses. any destroyer you care to mention, celestis, eagle...that's just going through the market picking off ships i've rarely or never seen people fly. i'm sure there are many, many, many more.the list just goes on and on of useless ships (mostly active armor tanking/hybrid ships, mind you) that have their biggest bonuses ignored because they are so badly designed or their specs have remained static whilst the rest of the game has evolved, or they were just given 'junk' bonuses to begin with in order to provide 'a wide range of tactical options' that just happen to be completely ineffective."

5/30/2010,"yes, that's what's happening, and i understand why that's what's happening. i just don't see why that should be what's happening. i don't know how easy it would be to code an exception to that, though, as you are technically setting a waypoint to an object, that object is in a system...so most of the time (this being pretty much the only exception) you would want the waypoint to be the system where the object is. only when the object is a stargate might there be a difference."

5/30/2010,have a one off 31 day ghost training ability so you can get all your alts on the same day for billing. limiting it to 31 days one time then back to the three would not cause too much of an issue i would think. where as unsubbing and re subbing 10 times over seven months due to the 3 day timer now is a pain and that's only on 3 accounts.please dun flame me too hard if theres some easy way to do this if i don't know. its just something i figured effects a lot of people
5/30/2010,"and you show why ccp rightfully dropped ghost training.not supported. if you want the training time, pay for it."
5/30/2010,"i would happily pay for it, but as of right now there is no way i know of that you can pay for a partial month. if one of my accounts getting seven days free over 1 month instead of 3 and the other get 20 over seven months it works out the same either way.edit: in the 2.5 years i've been playing my accounts have something like 60 billing cycles. i've never unsubbed. another option would be one account that cost me 45 dollars and holds all 9 heads where any three can train at once."
5/30/2010,"there are better solutions to this problem - for example, the ability to create a petition to change the billing date. bringing back ghost training isn't the right call here, because i can guarantee that it won't be used for this by more than 1% of the people who use it."
5/30/2010,you can do that? i'm going to go do that now then i don't remember ccp saying you could do something like that anywhere which is why i started this.
5/30/2010,"right now it's a toy that hides in a corner only to be discovered by someone who pokes around new interfaces and toys.most common joe pilots aren't going to see this let alone use it.borrowing from a concept in micro$oft'$ outlook.... i propose the following -if a ceo/director makes a event on the calendar... have it send a notification to the appropriate ""group"" offering a choice to ""accept,tentative, or reject"" so that the members are notified by evemail or notifications of new events.what's the point of having a calendar if no one knows its there?if this has been proposed... its likely it didn't specifically point it out. sorry in advance.feel free to flesh out.

5/30/2010,i got a simple fix just make it so people who used rr cant dock or jump for a minute or something like that. sounds like a easy fix.
5/30/2010,"yep, aggro for rr is a long overdue fix."
5/30/2010,"i have a counter proposal, rr should not effect badgers or any tech 2 industrial derivative of this hull.as industrials are obviously not combat ships and anyone that gets killed by one is so terrible they should just quit the game, remote reps should not repair them."
5/30/2010,"webs are pretty bad when combined with a warp disruptor, even with 2 of them they seem to be barely effective at stopping ships, and the rapier and huginn are abysmal they should get a small strength bonus. a small boost to webs is in order and a rethink of the web-specialising ships wouldnt go astray too."
5/30/2010,"makes scram+web even more powerful at producing full stop results, but i agree disruptor+web fits could use the minor help of a 10% web boost."
5/30/2010,"i disagree.if anything, they should remove mwd-disabling effect from the scramber, replacing it with efficiency reduction one. say, applying a scram reduces your mwd speed boost by 50%. shutting it off completely basically brings us back the old 'zone of death' ccp whined about."
5/30/2010,"rapier, huginn and keres should get a x1.05/level bonus to web effectiveness (would make a 60% web in to a 75% web at level 5)"
5/30/2010,i would agree with this as long as it came with a slight boost to web strength (especially as dual prop is now 100% more usefull than web scram on frigs) and also some kind of bonus to interceptor and af usage of them as so many cool frigs only have two medsit seems every faction ship and his sister has 90% webs now anyway.
5/30/2010,"i love my rapier, and personally think it needs a little love. 70% webs are not overpowered at all, especially in the day and age of dramiels.supported."
5/30/2010,"i'd say just the keres and huginn, not the rapier. the combat recon needs to be more effective than the force. but yeah, that's the only web strength bonus needed(aside from the serp/blood/marauder ships that get the 10% bonus, ofc)."

5/30/2010,so... you want fw rewards without the fw risk of pvp?
5/30/2010,"nice troll, but whatever i'll bite.fw mechanics is, other then the big happy wardec, entirely pve based, (much to its detriment). so basicly all you want is to move it to high sec where it's nice and safe? are that afraid of low sec? or are you just some sort of mentally challenged hunch-back?"
5/30/2010,"this is a genuine, proposal.- ok, for the achievement of gaining ranks, it could a ratio, in favour of the pvp fw- from my understanding of fw mechanics, you accept a mission from a npc agent, but your opponents could be real players, when they find you.many people say that eve is a pvp game. but it does have a pve element. why not increase the pve content?"
5/30/2010,"haha, no."
5/30/2010,"i think it's workable, but your ""all rewards and ranks to be the same as the pvp based fw"" butchered it, hard."
5/30/2010,"i subscribed to eve a little less than 15 days ago so i have very little skin in the game and very little to lose should i decide to leave...which is something i'm mulling over at the moment. those that wish to tell me ""if you don't like it leave"", save your breath!i decided to subscribe to eve on the promise, or expectation that the game was open-ended and that a player could do whatever they chose. i thought i could make a living in-game as a salvager/explorer, it was only after having subscribed that i found out salvaging is not considered an honorable profession in eve and so why it may be so heavily penalized, but heavily penailized it is. why am i here? i filed a petition and along with the helpful response from the gm was given two links, one here and one to the designers/developers. they are next. below is an excerpt of the petition filed.one of the definitions of salvage most appropriate to eve is:""...;something extracted (as from rubbish) as valuable or useful""it does not make sense that out of 7 of 10 ship wrecks i would receive the message that my salvaging attempt was successful yet there was nothing to salvage. that is what just happened! in the last few days i've seen this message pop up 50% or more when salvaging wrecks. i'm not sure whether it has anything to do with the training of the skill but as i have just advanced that skill i'm finding more occurrences of coming away completely empty handed which seems backwards to what one would expect if they look at it logically. in fact, if one has the proper equipment and training every ship wreck should be salvageable and only the time it takes to perform the task and what is being salvaged tied to the skill level itself. every ship wreck should at least yield scrap metal....eventually that is, regardless the skill level. it is becoming very annoying to have a skill trained and not be able to benefit from it. as i said, this message suggesting the salvaging was successful but nothing of value remained is one i never saw until just recently, and if not tied to the advancement of the salvaging skill then it seems likely there has been a game algorithm change to address some other issue. i've recently become aware from reading old posts that there has been some controversy over salavging wrecks so maybe the game designers are trying to address that issue? i would like to have explained to me the purpose for this message and whether the salvaging skill level is supposed to affect its occurrence.i just spent 1.5 hours salvaging 14 wrecks...my wrecks, and to my discouragement not only did i get the ridiculous message for 7 of those that the salvage attempt was successful but there was nothing of value, i also had a message...a message i hadn't seen before for 4 of the 14 wrecks saying the salvage attempt failed because the wreck had already been salvaged. there was no one around to salvage the wreck but me. so out of 14 shipwrecks created by my hand, 3 yielded anything of value. i use the term 'value' loosely because it was all crap! this game is obviously tailored to those wishing to mine, do combat missions, or haul goods. decent living can be made doing all three. a player can go out and mine ore from an asteroid that is right in front of them, not unlike a shipwreck, yet never have to worry about receiving a message; ""you successfully mined the ore but the ore was of such poor quality, you got nothing"" such a message would at least be equitable to what a salvager faces. the mining profession even has tools safeguarding against mining depleted asteroids.only allowed so many characters here so quickly 2 suggestions:1. revise the code so that successful salvage attempt = salvage, failed salvage attempt = no salvage. increase the % of failure if it needs to be more difficult. 2. provide tools to prescreen shipwrecks. tools exist for all other professions, why not salvaging too."
5/30/2010,maybe lets keep the discussion in the features and ideas cross post. it isnt really an issue that the csm has to push.
5/30/2010,"also cross posting is bad, mmkay?"

5/30/2010,"i admit i didn't read all that wall of text. but i think you say ""**** this, this is worthless, no isk in this, taking too much time..blah blah blah""here are things that will make you a good salvager1. use a destroyer.2. fit 4 tractor beams and 4 salvagers on it. add a cap recharge and a cargo expander as well3. after your done with a mission, salvage it.4. if its not ""fast"" enough, use salvage rigs. those rigs will give you more chance of success.5. don't forget to train salvage to level 4 at least so you scream less at your computeroptional: in my opinion, only salvage wrecks that are from blood raiders, sansha or the angels. the rest are worthless in my opinion unless you buy the blueprint and make some.if you want to know more about this stuff, contact me ingame and i will gladly help youfor your post, only thing i agree is if theres nothing, just say it. dont say its succesfull but with me, i don't even look each time i succeed or not."
5/30/2010,"ships in certain missions yield little or no salvage ('buzz kill' is a good example of this), while others yield quite a bit (i've salvaged almost 50 titanium bars from ae4 a few times). judging by your post, you're probably only doing lvl 1-3 missions atm. these are not worth salvaging imo. get into a bs and start running lvl 4s or find a system with lvl 4 agents and salvage there.salvaging is not a great money maker unless you're willing to put the time in. there's nothing wrong with it currently so just find another way to make isk if you're not happy salvaging."

5/30/2010,"ok, before we go off the handle here about modifying the ui. lets take a minute to think about it.please read my argument. i'm not asking for mods to be introduced. i'm asking for ccp to allow the community to develop the ui for them.argument:players who can modify their ui will have an advantage.if the ui's are housed in a central place which can be controlled and monitored, it would allow for nobody to have an advantage. a central place for players to download other ui's.the current iteration of the eve ui is dated and needs a lot of work. it's not customizable at all and is clunky. if you look at most other mmo's who have a functional and user friendly ui, they have an api for the user to interaction with and allow for the user to change the ui completely. the developer then takes these changes and implements the good ones directly into the game. other mmo's have benefited from this by allowing the players to assist in the development of the game. instead of focusing on changing one problem and putting a team of developers on it, you can put the entire user base on it and ccp can just develop an api for players to interact with. they, ccp, can then strip the ui down to it's bare essentials. leave a very basic ui then provide the community an api to make changes to the elements which each person whishes to see. you could also implement a way to add images. now, by using evegate to show off the ui, you'd attract players to use evegate and you'd further keep the game ""fair"". a basic upload and repository would be added to evegate. this would be monitored by ccp engineers to ensure no executables were added or scripting which interacts adversely to the new api."

5/30/2010,"this is a ankh thread, and she believes shooting people in eve is immoral."
5/30/2010,"hello new eden,i<U+FFFD>m here to tell you a little story about the true mechanics behind the formation of the csm council. let it be known first that i<U+FFFD>m not claming hax, devs or ccp for anything i<U+FFFD>m going to reveal. every vote was (as far as i can tell) submitted and counted as intended.the story:back in 2008, after the first csm was elected, i was wondering if it would be possible to rig the election towards a certain candidate. when csm 2 elections where anounced, i cheked the applications and wondered how the thousands of voters who know none of the candidates would decide for a candidate. when browsing the assemly hall, it hit me:nobody would read all candidate topics, they would rather read the ones on page one and the ones with the highest ""read"" and ""replies""-count. as it wasn<U+FFFD>t possible for me to use 10 alts to answer to a topic (as ankhesentapemkah did), i wrote a little prog to raise the ""read""-count of my chosen candidate (vuk lau btw.) when the results rolled in, it turned out my candidate had won, with 10,1% of the votes he became chairman!now i know you are all going to scream ""but he<U+FFFD>s the leader of a big alliance, he was bound to win because of the northern block giving him all the votes"". i thought about that, too, and tested it by using csm 3 and delaying my ""reading-session"" until voting had already started. this time, vuk got only 7,3% of the votes, also the nc had grown and despite vuk beeing the only true ""nc""-candidate this time (vily of rzr was a candidate for csm2). at csm 4 i ""supported"" elvenlord, also late, but i still wasn<U+FFFD>t sure about the actual impact i made. than something wonderful happended: for csm 5, all candidates where allowed to run for csm again!now i could simply not support vuk, thus making the actual drop in votes visible:without my support, vuks results plummeted to a meager 4,2%, less than half of his first results, despite the larger numbers the ""nc"" can muster in game atm.and even more important, i found somebody else using my principles: while f5ing the eve-o forums i saw ankhesentapemkahs topic getting a few hundert hits in less than a minute (and she had a super high reply count, coincidentally a ****load of peeps who never post on the eve-o forums except when it<U+FFFD>s csm-time.a. missed the chairman-position, but that might be because of all the less friendly comments in her topic, and she still more than doubled her results from last time, despite being an annoying spammer in jita local.conclusion:-a lot of people vote by popularity-a lot of people who don<U+FFFD>t know who<U+FFFD>s popular make their decision based on the ""answers"" and ""read""-count of the candidates topics in the assembly hall-people have used this to rig the election (and will use it again)-eve players are like a herd of sheepwhy have i written this wall of text?-to amuse myself-to make isk (send isk ingame, please)-to ensure that next time, every csm-candidates topic will have a few 100k reads (it doesn<U+FFFD>t even matter if my assumptions are right, people will do it (or have already done it, see a.)tl;dr:to get into csm, write a little prog to up your ""read""-count (or destroy your f5-button), use a few alts to up the replies of your topic and stay on page one, and spam jita localbest whishes from spacecamp and a happy csm term."

5/30/2010,"oh come on, this is not about discrediting ankh. in fact, if my assumptions are anywhere close to the truth, she might actually win some of the ""e-respect"" of the ""eve is hardcore, scaming is cool lolololol""-fraction that is crying about her ideas all the time.what was done was not forbidden and is no exploit, it just shows how eve players are easily manipulated, not just by a."

5/30/2010,maybe you should read the op before u comment.
5/30/2010,"i did bro, and it was all about sexy serbs, not dutch wymmenz"
5/30/2010,"as in what the results would be if we only counted users older than 2 years and so on?unfortunately, giving such information is not possible. the csm elections are anonymous - who someone voted for is not logged at all in our systems. when a vote is cast, a vote is added to that candidates tally and then the account is flagged as having voted to prevent it from being able to vote again. we have no way of looking back and seeing who voted for who, all we can see is who voted, and who received the most votes.any ideas for further demographics/stats on the users who did vote would be appreciated though."
5/30/2010,how about completing a questionaire just before voting next time ie 5 quick questions which could incl answers to question to get insfo not readily available
5/30/2010,i don't think it's up to ccp to find out who voted for whom.if the eve playerbase would like to know more about what kind of player voted for whom they have the option to start something of their own and add a poll in it.ccp gave more than enough information about the average age of the account and such.for more detailed information just do your own footwork.
5/30/2010,"you can capture whatever demographic information is available about the voter at the time the vote is cast, and store that anonymously with their vote...then you can mine the data all you want (i wrote the anonymous survey, such as employee feedback surveys, etc., software at work, so i kind of understand the pitfalls and the user concerns about privacy). you give up nothing, and gain a lot, statistic-wise....it just takes some prior planning is all."
5/30/2010,"you did a breakdown of times votes were cast, how about a per-candidate breakdown of these times? it would only really be interesting for me this time, to see how many a certain candidate got before the candidate selection page was shuffled."
5/30/2010,"out dam'd troll!(been awhile since i had the pleasure of trolling you - couldn't resist!).as for the op...ahnk is elected, and in. get over it.htfu.(p.s. - this is not an alt, and no alts were harmed in the posting of this anti-alt post, post... or something like that!)."

5/31/2010,"not just one csm supporting it, liang.the issue has been discussed before, but never pursued by the csm since it was an issue raised by ankhesentepemkah. they preferred to argue with her about wording, rather than discuss the issue at hand.i'd settle for ""finishing"" rather than ""excellence"". ccp, commit to finishing what you started rather than jumping to the next new thing and building up a huge technical debt.this thread is a duplicate, by the way: [bracket] urging ccp to work on current issues next expansion, ccp and ""implement now, develop later"","
5/31/2010,"agreed, quantity seems to be how they want to lure new players in but quality will help them retain players. if you get people here and they find that everything is half-finished they are just going to leave."

5/31/2010,yes and yes
5/31/2010,i fully support this proposal
5/31/2010,"strongly supported.it makes sense that releasing new content helps to market the game and invite new players. however, i think that if the players are happy with the game, marketing through word of mouth can be just as or even more effective. and, unlike, other mmo's, this game doesn't need to release new dungeons just to keep the existing player base. pvp plus improvement of existing content would work just as well.look at blizzard, a hugely successful company, some of whose games released 10 years ago are still being played today. there are not known as leaders in innovation. but every one of their games is very very polished. i think that is what really helped to set them apart.i am not trying to pick on you, but i think that this overly pessimistic attitude is not helpful. i see this from many people on the forums. over-dramatizing things makes it easier for the devs to dismiss the issues as ""just grumpy players"".the new pi content and dust does sound interesting and there were of speed improvements, lots of small fixes and tweaks in the last patch. a lot of work went into the patch and it made the game better. we should be trying to convince ccp that they should strive to make an excellent game, not tell them that everything they ever do just makes things worse."

5/31/2010,"supportedleaving a lot of the core features unfinished will cause a lot of problems for ccp in the long term as more subscribers leave (not just because of :bittervet: but also because they kept getting frustrated by the game). ccp will then be forced to attract more subscribers by adding new features, neglecting the other parts of the game even more. this can lead ccp into a vicious cycle of having to chase new subscribers while losing slowly the long term subscribers.high subscriber turnover, a poor quality game and developers with short term ambitions is not what i want to see."

5/31/2010,"mea culpa - caldari is the one race i don't fly, so i forgot that the nighthawk loses a mid compared to the drake. stupid ferox hull. so yeah, the nighthawk actually has less ehp than the drake, at least if you expect it to have the speed mod and point that the drake can carry. mind you, if you ditch the point, a heavy missile nighthawk has 6k more ehp and 11 more dps than a ham drake, not to mention 4x the range. the ham fit has no range or missile precision advantages, but it beats the drake by 66 dps instead of 11. i'm not going to pretend that ditching the point isn't a serious failing - it is. losing the sixth mid hurts. and i suppose it does wreck my previous claim. but the nighthawk is the worst field command anyways, and my objections to your changes were primarily based on the three good field commands. i mean, boosting the nighthawk is a reasonable thing to ask for. the csm already passed that one. but boosting the sleipnir? really? that's the part that made me laugh at this thread. as for cost efficiency arguments, just ask yourself this. does the dramiel need a boost? after all, it's 200x as expensive as a rifter, and it's certainly not 200x as effective."
5/31/2010,"small gang pvp which these ships are designed for means ham's work perfectly fine. actually the astarte in my opinion is even worse than the nighthawk. and the absolution barely better. i agree the sleipnir is decent, but it is definitively not good, it is simply the better of the lot... which really does not say much. it can't fit a half decent active tank with mwd and a point (808 dps tanked, cap lasts just above 1 min with mwd off, needs a cpu mod as well, 830dps), or it can do a ''bigger vagabond'' kind of fit which brings it to same dps, 71k ehp, aligns slower than a tempest, but a gang mod actually fits now. <- a tempest does the bigger vaga thing better... thats saying something! if you play around with fits and consider my proposals (and we cant really give some of these ships slots and not the others), you will find that they are very balanced in comparison to what their niches are supposed to be (2 each (staying power in small gangs and the ability to give gang bonuses while utilizing a proper fit (astarte being a pure dmg dealer instead)). in no way whatsoever would any of these ships become overpowered. and as for the last part, the dramiel and the daredevil are what i always have considered the lvl of efficency pirate ships should be at, i find those 2 ships perfectly balanced (the others need a little buff). 90m fitted vs 3m fitted = 30x as expensive btw ;)"
5/31/2010,"i didn't say that hams were bad. i said that a nighthawk with low-dps weapons outdpsed a drake with high-dps weapons(even before you take the explo velocity bonus into account). as for the case of the sleipnir, it's not a vaga. they're kind of similar, but not really. with similar fits(ambit-rigged autocannons, designed to hold orbit out of web range, in this case) the vaga moves twice as fast, and the sleip has 3x the ehp and 50% more dps plus a gang link. how do you compare those? as for the tempest, i really don't know wtf you're talking about. putting the tempest into a similar fit, it moves 300 m/s slower than the pest and takes 50% longer to align, though it gets about 50% more range, 20% more ehp, and 30% more dps. did you put a 1600mm on a sleipnir or something? as for the dramiel, i agree that it's a fine ship, though i'm more of a daredevil man. but on the cost side, i've seen plenty of rifters that cost under a mil(because really, why are you putting t2 on a ship that cheap?), and a few dramiels that cost a whole lot more than 90(t2 rigs and rf gyros do that). fitted cost is a function of how much you're inclined to pay. but if you agree that even an x30 cost bump should get you x2 capability, what should a x4 or so cost bump like a field command ship get you?"

5/31/2010,"realistic objectives? eve online pve developers/designers should take a short sabbatical, get copies of x-wing vs tie fighter & x-wing alliance, play them through several times, and learn what good pve content involves. convoy interception/interdiction. strategic strikes against specific targets. defending convoys against interdiction. preventing key targets leaving the battle. all of these ideas can be incorporated into missions to help pve content train up mission runners in the use of pvp fittings and tactics.dynamic content is good - players should not be able to refer to cheat sheets (mission survival guides, for example) to succeed in combat.competitive missions sounds like a great tie-in for ""live events"".having npcs using fittings similar to what pvpers would use, makes sense to me. no more ""chance to webify"" - an angel webifier will use its webifier, end of story. the angel rogue will use it warp scrambler, end of story. it would be nice if ewar such as neuts worked effectively against npcs too, so mission-runners could gradually learn to use the tools of pvp."

5/31/2010,"full support.to the naysayers: armor already gets the bigger buffer, slave sets work on capitals (crystals don't), shield x-fers are stupidly hard to fit compared to rr. and now you want this bug to stay 'cause shieldtanks on fleetlevels are totally overpowered."
5/31/2010,"supported. we do quite alot of roaming in small mobile shield gangs, having your bonus disappear every time you go to a new system is really annoying and should be fixed.this, along with the stupid-stupid cpu reqirements on shield transporters is probably why this is not as popular as armor buffering."
5/31/2010,"agreed. having to navigate menus and click 2 or 3 times for common, straight forward tasks is a bit daft."
5/31/2010,"mission load balancing woesin tyrannis, ccp corrected load balancing, which should have resulted in mission runners being sent into less-populated systems. unfortunately, the feature renders many agents invalid and negatively affects lowsec missionrunners. the following problems are a result of this feature:being sent into lowseca disproportionate amount of players are being sent into low-sec from highsec systems several jumps away. this results in players abandoning agents near lowsec systems and balling up deeper into highsec, overloading the few good agents that are left.lowsec runners sent out of systemlowsec missionrunners are being sent out of system much more often, increasing risk considerably, or forcing them to decline too much missions and running out of agents. in addition, they are sent to highsec more often, where players with low security status or faction standing cannot go.solutions* highsec agents should never pick lowsec systems as destination, as lowsec missions will always be declined anyway.* lowsec agents should strongly favor the current system over neighbouring systems, as lowsec missionrunners will likely decline missions out of system."
5/31/2010,"what makes you think they arent monitoring lvl5 mission runners? they monitor everything else.this 'idea' (makes a change heh) only makes missions worse than they are, when people decline missions they have to decide if its worth it for example they may have that boring mission coming up within 4 hours, a courier mission or something that sends them into lowsec.your idea just allows more rejects, plus as a lvl 4 mission runner i hope that ccp make it so that 50% of lvl 4 missions do take you into lowsec but also increase bounty / meta item drop rate./not supported, as a (temp) carebear i am already shocked at how easy mission running is.oh and if you are in lowsec you know the risks anyway 'limit to the system' wtf, theres no bubbles in low sec making it impossible to get paranoid dockers."
5/31/2010,"""load balancing"" should only be applied if there is actually significant load. thus agents in systems such as dodixie, motsue and emolgranlan will end up sending people out of the system more regularly.as it happens, vir honn in emolgranlan is sending me to ammold more often now, which is a good thing. there are around 80 people in local when i'm running missions during australian peak time (ie: two hours before/one hour after downtime). apart from being sent to ammold more regularly, i haven't noticed any change in mission locations.i don't feel that level 5 agents should ever have given out missions in hisec."
5/31/2010,"agreed, this is going to lead to more concentration away from lowsec borders.l5 missions is a sad casualty. most of us were running them as a break from the tedium of the never changing l4s, and as they take longer to get and run the rewards are not that much greater over time, if at all, than l4s. an unnecessary nerf imho. the infrequent highsec l5s were also a viable option for less frequent players with limited hours of play."
5/31/2010,"i agree that there should be some limit in how far afield the agents expect you to go. but highsec agents never, ever sending you to lowsec? even if it's an agent in a pocket? that's just absurd. put 90% of missions in a 1-jump radius, and let people use their cancellation on the other 10%. the bit about lowsec missions being concentrated more strongly in the same system does make sense to me. but that's not enough to make me support this."
5/31/2010,"do you agree that the issue bears further discussion?that's what ""support"" means - you support the discussion going on, if not the idea. enough people ""supporting"" the discussion means the csm get to pick it up as an item for one of their meetings."
5/31/2010,"all l5s should be in lowsec exclusively. they should never be allowed in high sec. ever.second, all lowsec agents should never send a mission runner to a high sec system. ever.third, if mission runners are 'balling up' around agents that are so deeply embedded in high sec that they don't send players to lowsec then simply move all l4 agents around so that they're evenly distributed near large sections of lowsec so that every agent will send players to lowsec equally well."
5/31/2010,"if low sec agents should send you to high sec, then the other way around it should also be true.load balancing should indeed only be active in high load systems."

5/31/2010,"you really don't get it, do you? if people are missionrunning in highsec, they will not go into lowsec with their expensive pve setups because the risk then is far greater than the possible rewards. you will never get more players in lowsec by force, it has to be by choice.so to correct your third point: all highsec agents should never send a mission runner to a low sec system. ever. if someone running missions wants to do so in low sec, they can easily find themselves an agent there.on the topic of l5s, i think it would be a good idea to have l5s available in highsec so players looking for just a pve challenge can find one without having to deal with a significant pvp challenge on top of it. make these agents q-20 for all i care, just give us the challenge."
5/31/2010,"this is common sense, now to figure out a way to teach ccp this most beneficial of skills.when two different security rated systems are used, why not let reward for a given mission be based on the lower of the two?would make high-to-low missions a lot more viable (ie. less need to decline) while having only a minor impact in high->high and low->low scenarios.lvl5's to high-sec should be a big no no, huge oversight if they do indeed exist."
5/31/2010,"well, i'm going to support this since missioning is something of a cluster **** right now. but, l5s should never have been in high sec.-liang"
5/31/2010,no more safe l5s
5/31/2010,"in theory, perhaps. in practice, ankh is a csm and can raise whatever issues she wants to. i don't think she has ever created an issue and then not raised it at a meeting in the year she was on csm(the same as most other csms), so i assume it'll go on and get discussed further no matter what i say. hence, i'll just throw in my two cents on the topic generally."
5/31/2010,"i'm supporting this, because as it is now it makes the game less fun. also, i'm not particularly against lvl 5's in highsec. my attempts to get highsec lvl 5's resulted in 6 days of farming an agent and it only turning out a mission that requires a rattlesnake supported by an basilisk, or a good sized fleet. maybe more important than lvl 5's in highsec, what's needed is some interesting pve. and no, 'making it require an interceptor and throwing you into camped 0.0' does not count as interesting.i want to throw in a request for a dev blog documenting how many missions of what type are run for each faction, including the epic arcs."
5/31/2010,"i think it's completely fair to have all level 5 missions be run in lowsec. highest mission, and if i'm correct they have capitals in them? anyways, it makes sense for them to be run in lowsec.level 4 agents now kinda suck if they are anywhere near lowsec. if my border agent doesn't send me to egghelende, it sends me through egghelende to odette, or stegette. it just isn't feasible for me to take my ships through egghelende. i know the pirates there and know what they are capable of. people saying""get over it"" and ""get protection"" are full of ****. it is very difficult to run a mission and avoid pirates who have probes out at all times, or at least a probing alt in system. they will be on you in no time. it may be possible to successfully defend against pirate attacks in lowsec, but it's much more cost efficient to just go further into highsec. with that being said, the risk goes up, but having to either split the reward with other pilots, or hire help, causes the reward to go down. risk vs reward there is borked. much more efficient to just go to highsec, do them solo, and get it all to yourself."
5/31/2010,i support this partly.the load balancing in lowsec is total crap. if 14 people in local is considered to be such heavy load that i get 8 missions in a row 3 jumps away then there is definitely something wrong.l5s should only be in lowsec. they were designed to be a boost for lowsec and if it was intended that there where highsec l5s then there would be agents in highsec.for high agents 1-2 jumps from lowsec border i think they should still give you some missions in lowsec and not only missis in high.
5/31/2010,"stop trying to piggyback bad/contentious ideas onto otherwise innocuous proposals. while some parts of what you want are reasonable, your proposals are insufficiently granular. the complaint about lowsec agents sending people out of the agent system is somewhat justifiable, but i will not support highsec l5s. and while i can see a case for highsec agents primarily giving out highsec missions, people go to agents near lowsec in part because of the superior lp/isk payouts associated with running missions for agents based in 0.5 and 0.6 systems. if these agents will never send you into dangerous space, it's rather hard to justify those superior payouts, no?"
5/31/2010,i keep getting this fw mission. couldn't they at least reduce the frequency. this mission comes up at least 3 out 4 times. it's getting frustrating constantly receiving a mission i have no desire to do.

5/31/2010,"i'm asked to do this...issue with eve skill training model: + too rigid. there are only so much you can do to min/max your training speed. none of which would make you feel involved. + too linear. everything else considered equal, you shall never catch up to a currently titan pilot if you just joined in the year 2005 + too slow. this is very objective. i have played korean games where they have 6 digits behind the comma on their ""% to next level"" counter but no one complain. thus, i make the assumption that the ""too slow"" feeling is caused by the frustration of not being able to do anything to catch up, a combination of eve training being too rigid and linear.this suggestion would solve all these issues at once, as well as open up many interesting endeavor:allow us to use plex to double training speed for a month (instead of extending subscription.) applicable only if you are not one of the 10% characters with highest amount of sp and if you are not already receiving any kind of skill training bonus such as the new character bonus or an already existing plex bonus.why plex? + plex can be used by anyone, not just people with a fat bank account. + plex is already equal to one month game time. you are already paying for sp with your subscription, it makes sense to be able to pay double. in fact, by paying for boosted skill training you are already missing out a whole month of watching roid spining, red + flashing or your freight aping its courier contract.why does it make skill training less rigidyou now have an option, that isnt free to be active, to speed up training. the extra consideration of taking this option stack on and go along with other existing options to speed up training, making the whole process more flexible.why does it make skill training less linearnot everyone will and/or can tackle on this option thus your skill difference with your peers will no longer stay constant. especially if you are one of the many people borderlining the 10% highest sp mark.will training feel less slow?casual players wont feel a thing and most likely wont bother. most harder core people will still take forever to get anything trained, but they will definitely train faster and make them a little more happy, i guess.bonus points: + boost the plex market. more money to ccp. + keep people logged in, many will have to log in twice as often ""to play the game from time to time"" now, cause of the increased training speed. + the snobs of 100m sp club will quickly find themseves not very exclusive + encourage people to skill their char instead of buying from the bazaar. + ccp get to ban bots more frequently."

5/31/2010,"character limit killed much of the quotes.edit: wow, i'm tempted to thumb up my own idea. never noticed that tick.if you dont pay, you cant play past trial. the more you pay, the more sp you can accumulate. $ already has obvious value in eve.who?you are one of the casual players i have mentioned. doesnt mean no one shouldnt have the choice because you dont use it.please first read my proposal. it stacks on those methods, just like playing one more month does. how's playing one more month hurt your control over your learning rate? this feature (double learning rate) is available to new characters. you are free to ask the newbs if they anticipate new unlocks. paying for the game is already paying for sp. character bazaar, created later, thus is a reinvention of the wheel in your own logic. maybe we should remove it.where was it proposed before?lycosa rabida's law: 90% of the time, people read less then 10% of your post before replying.this is not an objective argument, no matter how much you say it is. feeling of ""fun"" or ""enjoyable"" are subjective measures and has no business being in a logical argument.in all given situations, a titan pilot does not always fly a titan. thus while it's possible for a new character to perfect titan piloting, he'd fail flat in any other situation not involving the titan comparing to the older titan pilot. it's like when an ambidextrous person and a right handed person both get the right arm chopped off then have a duel. i know who i'm going to bet for. in reality, more sp always give more options and that matter.try not to play on eve so much and try to save money for more logical, meaningful endeavors. you might see your pension sooner that way."
5/31/2010,"roughly once every 10-15 days for the last 4 years some bright spark has come up with the idea that players should be allowed to buy sp. the posts have 3 things in common: they always seem to think they're the first, they always propose a incredibly low isk price, and they are always by people who just can't understand why anyone would hate their wonderful idea.search out some examples for yourself. there are plenty.and no, before you say it, the fact that quite a few people have posted the idea on these forums does not make it a good one.to cut to the chase: your idea would allow rich, high-sp players to convert a small fraction of their wealth in to have an even greater sp advantage over the new players. plus it would devalue the achievement of playing your character for long enough to have high sp, plus it would create the classic mudflation scenario where new players would have to spend $$$.in short: enjoy your yearly stat respecs, cheap implants, initial training bonus and all the other nice things that new players get that older ones didn't. they are enough and more than enough."

5/31/2010,"ok so i had a wacky idea last night.why not do it so when your in warp to somwhere you can stop your ship so you end up out of warp in middle of the 2 celestiels, its basicly same as stop ship when your moving or before warp but its for when your in warp, your ship will slow down like normaly coming out of warp not just stop dead in space.there are a few rules for this 1. you cannot stop ship 2au away from each celes this stops pple from warping and hitting it asap to get as close as possible to celestial.rest i dunno yet lol xdiv forgotten most of idea but that weas basicly it and i know it can be overpowered/overused but at same time your fleet needs a prober at all times to find the ships just stoping. but at same time it can help you very well.allso another idea was that since warp scramblers block your mwd why not have bubbles stoping cloaks or hics points stoping cloak allso that way if someone is caught in one they cannot cloak but if there in a ship designed to cloak it may be able to get away still, and if the ship warps to ass (from belts or from a gate or whatever) they can still cloak because they canot be found straight away if they just cloak so it doesnt break the mod. but in my eye's the cloak is abit overpowered as there isnt anyway to stop this mod part from 2km away which as we all know is sometimes if not all by luck.so i just thought of something that uses in-game item allready here more usefull and its just for 0.0 for bubbles but you can bring it to low-sec/high-sec by using the hic point, maybe make a new script for it for just cloakers or something like that .allso for the stop in warp idea do it so that even if there is a bubble up on gate/station/whatever you carnt stop warp so your auto pulled into bubble from moment you start warp"
5/31/2010,that way dont slam the door on the way out
5/31/2010,"ow my brain. so if i'm reading you right, you want to change warp mechanics pretty fundamentally for no apparent reason, and you want to make it so that covert ships can't run bubble camps any more, because at present they're hard to catch. no, no, a thousand times no."
5/31/2010,well the warp change doesnt have to happen just a random idea but if you thought for a sec the helios and all other ships designed for cloaks like curse and such could be given another bonus that stops there cloak from been affected there for they can still scout and sucheasy fix
5/31/2010,"reposting my reply from f&i:1. i am not sure the cancel warp works rp wise.and for me it seems a bit like ""they took me my logging of mid warp, now i want another mean of avoiding gate camps"". and you can do that already a good job on avoid drag bubbles and such with bouncing on planets so you get a slightly different angle.2. you can lock a ship. suddenly it cant cloak anymore. just in case you didnt know about that yet.so .... just a thought ... put a can on the side of the bubble where you expect people to it your bubble. voila they get decloaked or a ship.(cross posting is bad)"
5/31/2010,true on both parts but most ships can just cloak before you get a lock (that arnt meant for cloaking) and with a burst of mwd you can be gone from spot fast as hellbut yea i posted in fandi because the first person said it goes there :pfgyi i dnt live in 0.0 or travel to 0.0 anymore and its no whine just clearing things up just a wiered idea i had lol

5/31/2010,"problemcurrently, i believe eve gate is too focused on receiving updates from eve, while out of game. in my opinion, eve gate needs better access in-game. this proposal isn't about introducing new features to eve gate, per se, but increasing accessibility to eve gate's current features from within eve itself.currently, there are two main features in eve gate: broadcasts and the calender. currently, only one of these two features can be seen in-game, and that is the calender. to make a broadcast or view the broadcasts of other characters, you must log into eve gate via. the igb or an oog browser. i know several people who do not use the igb because they don't trust it for security reasons, so they'll never be able to access the broadcast window from within eve, given the current setup.ideabasically, i would love to be able to log into eve and check broadcasts from members to quickly get a glimpse of what they're up to or what they've been up to. yes, i could ask in corp chat, but sometimes it would be nice to skip the formalities and get straight to business! imagine if you could send a corp/alliance-wide broadcast, telling people what you're up to, e.g:maybe i'd log on and see a broadcast sent 30 minutes earlier saying:as people log on, they could pull up a broadcasts window and quickly get an overview of what the active members are up to, see whether anything is going on locally and then ask to join in. i believe this is, in part, what broadcasts were designed for: to allow people out-of-game to see what people are doing while in-game. the problem is that it's currently too cumbersome to send a broadcast from within eve.on a side note, i guess this would, in effect, allow broadcasts to be used to advertise impromptu events, while planned events would be advertised in the calender.solutionwhat i propose is that a facility is introduced to allow players to read and make broadcasts from within eve, without having to visit the eve gate website. this could be done through an expansion of the calender window, that currently exists within eve.the calender window could include a second tab at the top for broadcasts. from this tab, a player could send a new broadcast or view existing broadcasts.furthermore, the button (in the bottom left corner of eve) that is used to open the calender could be highlighted, blink or pulse when there are updates, be it a new broadcast or a new event on the calender. at the moment, the only way to see if there are new events is by randomly opening the calendar or by logging into eve gate.to expand on this in the future, possibly allow people to create broadcasts that expire and link said broadcasts to fleetsedit: formatting and colours"

5/31/2010,"i like it, this seems like a good extension of the original idea."
5/31/2010,supported. seems to be a good idea :)
5/31/2010,"no, i don't believe you can. i'm just saying, that would be a better solution than what you propose."
5/31/2010,"i know that it is currently available as a podacst via itunes, but it's cut at the end.my proposal is that ccp sell a full version of this absolutely awesome song via itunes, and donate all proceeds (minus the apple cut) to childs play.this is a fantastic track, clealy a lot of work has gone into producing it, and i would love to actually own an entire copy on my ipod to listen to in it's entirety.in future fund raising events, ccp could simply point ot this track; i'm hopeful that ccp could get apple to waive thier 'costs' on a charitable donation argument. but won't hold my breath.please support this notion."
5/31/2010,interesting idea. i like it.
5/31/2010,yes
5/31/2010,also make the calendar light up like evemail icon if you have new events
5/31/2010,"current sov systemok currently it takes almost 6 days to take a system with a station, ihub and tcu. i personally think this is way to long especially now with they decreased costs in building stations soon 0.0 will be riddled with stations everywhere. the current system requires a 2-3 day timer on the initial taking of system or when it is put into reinforce, so this means you half to individually shoot/rf the ihub, tcu and station. then you must come back and put it into reinforce again then wait another 2-3 days for everything to come out of rf again then you can blow it up. problemthe problem with this in my opinion it takes way to long to take a system a defend has week to come defend it and does not half to come defend it till the very end. and if you screw up while taking a system and have a bad day it starts all over again so you could fight for weeks and never accomplish anything yet you have put this particular system in reinforce like 8 times just werent able to finish the job due to lag or the other side just had the upper hand that daysolution lets get rid of the double reinforce timer if we did so it would:1)only take 3-4 days instead of 6-8 days to take a system.2)would make it easier for smaller alliances to take sov from bigger ones.also in other thought reduce the the over all size and hit points of any ihub:1) by reducing the size of the ihub it would make it easier for smaller alliances to get an ihub to 0.0. instead of using current method of getting a freighter and then praying it doesnt die on the way up.2)reducing the effective hit point it would take smaller alliance less time to take down the ihub and wouldnt require dreads to do so or sitting there forever in bs.discuss plz no troll."
5/31/2010,"suggestions welcome?ok.....formatting is a good thing, you should use it."
5/31/2010,"this invasion if anything has taught us that we should be allowed to join pirate factions and conquer empire, not just sansha but all of them.i believe we should be allowed to physically conquer space currently owned by other factions on behalf of another faction.this would certainly make fw more attractive and a little less like bgs from wow, it will directly affect everyone too and would promote rp who imo are the most creative in game."
5/31/2010,"i agree, pilots should be able to join the milita of pirate factions, not just the four empires.lowsec should have claimable sovereignty, in effect being an npc-claimed ""nullsec lite"". infrastructure hubs maintained by the militia, with limited upgrades available (cyno jammers, but no jump bridges or outposts, for example).note: this is a feature suggestion, not an assembly hall issue. see the thread ""pirate faction warfare"" in f&i forum."
5/31/2010,"not sure about the sov modules but yeah this would be an excellent and interesting way to groom people into 0.0 living, it will also increase lowsec population.it is a follow up on an old suggestion of mine a while back which i sadly lost but no matterpeople in empire dont have much experience with sov related stuff in 0.0, fw is a brilliant way to get into the mechanics ofc with sov being limited to a few powerblocs"
5/31/2010,"to get more people out into lowsec, we need more security. how much fun is it to deploy a pos and invest a few billions in reagents for reactions, only to have some fool from the pandemic legion ""rapid response"" team take your pos down by force with a dozen dreads and supercarriers while you're desperately trying to man the guns and rep the shields with a couple of basilisks?the step from hisec to lowsec needs to be more graduated. sovereignty agents (ie: folks who invest in the infrastructure to claim sovereignty for the npc faction) should be able to control whether capitals or supercapitals are allowed in their various lowsec systems.so we might have ""carebear empire"" who decides to build sov up to the level where they have sov 5 in the hisec-lowsec bridge system, with no cynos allowed at all, then in the neighbouring systems they allow capitals (so jump freighters can get from eg: vuorrassi to taisy, but no nalvula), and in systems surrounding them they allow supercapitals, but also have a heavy hired police presence to ensure that any hostile supercapitals will be met with 25 police squads - laughable, i know, but the police will remote rep each other and keep the supercap infini-pointed while broadcasting notice of the attack to the respective channel (eg: ""carebear empire police notifications""):aggression: police forces in [system name] have engaged [player name] who is piloting a nyx.ultimately, getting folks out to lowsec should be driven by more opportunities (for entrepreneurs, vigilantes and pirates alike). the biggest opportunity for carebears is security while pursuing profit.i'd like these sov upgrades to be available for everyone. thus every hisec system would have tcu and ihub in place. mission agents would be controlled by ihub upgrades, with folks living in hisec able to influence their local governments to determine the mixture of industry vs military upgrades, strength of local police force, etc.the difference between hisec/lowsec/nullsec would then be (a) who hold sovereignty (hisec and lowsec: npc sov, nullsec: player sov) and (b) who polices regulations (hisec: concord, lowsec/nullsec: players & hired npcs).then we could have players working with guristas (for example) to upgrade guristas systems and expand guristas sovereignty claims, fighting against big nullsec alliances at the nullsec border and other npc alliances at the lowsec borders.let's get the chance to play the bad guys :)"

5/31/2010,"i sincerely hope this is a troll, because otherwise it's one of the worst ideas i've seen in a while."
5/31/2010,"so i have a couple characters, ive been playing eve for a couple years, got a couple billion isk in the bank, couple dozen ships laying around, ive always thought that i was an average eve player, that is until today.. just moments ago i warped into a belt to find two unsuspecting angel frigates floating about some roids so i took it upon myself to bring safety to the 'verse and lock them down, after initiating the afterburner on my ishtar as well as my active hardeners i checked that i was within my optimal range for my turret/ammo and began to fire, in mere moments the armor of the first frigate was melting away, not wanting to waste my time launching a flight of drones i launched another salvo at the first frigate to see it lit up in a flash of light ""now i can focus on his"" i thought to myself as i locked my guns on my next target.. wait? what? it was charging out of my optimal fast.. i fired a quick round at the target and it glanced off the shields, loading up my long range ammo i continued to fire but alas the frigate had turned and escaped, making good use of its mwd and pointing directly away from me i chased it until it was around 300km away and it then warped away (or maybe despawned)obviously as of today i have become such a fearsome opponent that common npcs are re-writing their own code as to flee from their own imminent death.. or its a bug.. i propose we either install the npcs with a hearty dose of courage.. or fix said bug.. and overall i would like to propose that this thread be used to discuss the idea of new mechanics for our npcs, and that ccp and the development team look into making more interactive npcs.. i for one would like to see the big boss of a mission run away with your mission loot if you leave him for last.. or npcs that launch drones.. npcs that use varying strategies.. etc."
5/31/2010,"i like your thinking, ankhesentapemkah.reducing the variety of items sold through any one corporation's lp store & reducing the proximity of high-quality agents for any corporation should be enough to spread mission-runners out to some degree.improved possibility for trade is good too: by creating scarcity of items, the need for trade is generated."

5/31/2010,"most fps and the like use a cheat detecting app like punkbuster and while i'm mildly annoyed with such applications they do server a purpose. i would however have to say no on using something like that. there are creative alternatives that do not involve scanning anything. most of which are advanced data mining techniques that could be performed server side. many of these are used all the time by law enforcement and intelligence agencies for similar things. i'm not going to go into any detail in case they are being used, no reason to give the macro miners, real money traders, cheats, or other various scum that muck up the game for the rest of us any tips on how to avoid getting busted. if anyone from the csm or ccp would like to have a more detailed breakdown on my idea please send me a message in game."
5/31/2010,"i'm all for canning macros, but running software on the end user's computer is not going to solve the problem, in the same way that draconian drm doesn't stop people violating copyright.if you don't trust the end user, how can you trust their hardware? the more sophisticated hackers will just disable the ""warden"" and mock up a program that sends the server the ""all clear"" message.the less sophisticated people (eg: those who are just playing the game for fun) start finding that their computer runs slow, the disk is always active, the machine never enters ""sleep mode"", random software crashes for no reason, and they're banned from eve because they ran adobe cs5 which ""warden"" didn't recognise as being legitimate software.no, the way to crack down on macros is multi-pronged: first map out those pilots who have incredible stamina and can repeat mundane tasks with unerring accuracy for hours on end, second remove the mundane tasks that have to be repeated.turn mining into something a little less predictable. asteroids that spawn in different locations, are identified as ""barren"", ""interesting"", ""rich"" etc on overview, and require scanning with a survey scanner in order to identify which one is the one we want to mine today.perhaps require the pilot to enter ""asteroid view"", scan the asteroid for resources, and target the mining lasers at the appropriate part of the asteroid to extract the richest ore. we do this for planetary interaction already, after all.then remove the click-sink. allow the orca and rorqual to run ""cargo links"" which vacuum ore out of the mining ship's cargo hold at some rate (dependent on meta level of the cargo link, and cargo transfer skill level of the orca pilot, for example). removing click sinks will reduce efficiency of a macro compared to a human.so mining then becomes: survey asteroid field for interesting rocks, analyze asteroid to generate mining laser targets, start mining. an asteroid might consist of, eg: patches of barren (no minerals), large patches of ""veldspar"" or ""scordite"", smaller patches of the richer ores, etc.as we progress from hisec to nullsec, the asteroid gets bigger and contains a higher proportion of the richer ores. this replaces the current system where every ship's computer can tell the difference between rich and poor ores, and the random respawning will reduce the efficacy of having a bookmark near an asteroid that one mines on a regular basis.for missions, i'd prefer to see smaller fleets of harder npcs, with npcs always using their racial ewar along with webs and scramblers - right from level 1 missions. teach folks how to use pvp tactics the moment they get into their capsule, so pvp isn't so scary for them."

5/31/2010,"interesting theory, but i have to say correlation does not imply causation..."
5/31/2010,"back on topic, agreed. it would be however nice if, prior to the next elections, you picked a candidate at random on which you will unleash the exact same methods you did previously (the name would of course be kept from the public but stored with a third party for verification), and then show whether you can actively influence the outcome of the elections."
5/31/2010,"i think annoying + no publicity = lower votesoverall there were more votes, trying to correlate votes from previous csm and this csm is pretty hard.i think drama ( hits ) benefited a few candidates. probably people rallied behind certain candidates to contra as well. basically the net loser would be candidates with low visibility.its possible that some of the votes come this way. ( popularity only ) but most wining candidates have multiple avenues to garner votes. i reckon a strong campaign and broad appeal would be most important factor. imo highest votes in this csm was garnered in this manneras for the impact of long long threads, alot of it is garbage so unless someone is ( a ) forum denizen / ( b ) actively posting in said thread / (c ) vested i doubt they be motivated to read all that.personally i am unlikely to read up on a csm candidates with a thread with low hits. i just look up some site that would summarize stuff. like the csm comparison thingy etc. but that's just me.that might hurt those particular candidates with low visibility. if said candidates have no developed base & track record they would definitely have been impacted in this particular race.if someone starts garnering alot of attention, they could also leverage that to speak out to their base. fear is a great motivator. the apathetic ones would then probably be inclined to actually vote if they feel there is a threat.the irony would be delicious here.herd of sheep could be based on perception ? it could be construed as voting for someone because everyone in your block ( alliance / gameplay ) is voting that way. it might not be true 100% but the perception remains. or are you talking about sheep in another locale ?"
5/31/2010,the guys that are roleplaying girls vote for female candidates.just my 2 cents
5/31/2010,"i know, and i would have waited another term to perform some more tests, but as i<U+FFFD>m not the only one who does it anymore (if i ever was, i think bumping your own threads with alts is something many of the candidates do, i just took it to a somewhat higher level), it wouldn<U+FFFD>t be a real test anyway.still, i<U+FFFD>m going to compare the view counts of the upcoming csm election to the view counts reached this time, and if there is a big difference, i<U+FFFD>ll know i had some impact on the serious world of internet spaceships."
5/31/2010,"i agree. beeing invisible is the worst thing you can do as a csm candidateagain, i agree. the chairman of this csm won because he is popular in game, performed a good campaign and got some kind of block vote (and is a girl irl).your second point is exactly what i<U+FFFD>m talking about. you are unlikely to read a low hit thread. as you are not reading it, you are not going to vote for the candidate in question. so by rising the hit count, i raised the possibility for the people in question to get a vote.<<i<U+FFFD>ve cut something of your post away here>>i was talking about a sheep blindly following the herd (aka the threads with high view/post counts). i<U+FFFD>m far from claiming every eve player votes because he is in block a or becaues candidate b<U+FFFD>s thread had the most views, but i<U+FFFD>m claming that a significant amount of votes can be influenced by simply changing the view/post count of the candidates threads."
5/31/2010,anhk had highest readsmynxee secondand me thirdkorvin fourth (i think?)wheres my seat? or am i just especially ******ed.-t'amber
5/31/2010,"sadly, i havn<U+FFFD>t written down all read counts before i posted, so it might actually be possible that you perma-f5ed your own thread to prove me wrong.another possibility is the use of coloured writing in your candidate post. after playing eve-forums for years, you should have learned that this is a foolproof way to get people to hate you.edit to clarify:i<U+FFFD>m still not claming that a high read/post count is everything, i just claim that it helps. looking at my op, you can see vuks relative share go down (against the developement of nc numbers in game) with the read count of his csm threads. he still made it because of the block vote (i guess).the only things i actually know are that i did what i wrote, and that others did/do it, too, and the only thing i want is to imagine a bunch of nerdy eve-geeks mashing f5 the next time the csm is elected."
5/31/2010,"it was probably the colours, i didn't change my read amount or even click it to raise my count. i posted the stats in the jita speakers forum under irrelevant statistics or some such name.-t'amber"
5/31/2010,"capturing demographic data and relate it to a vote would lessen the anonymity. to my mind it should not be implemented within the voting systems. if you want demographics, poll them outside of the vote on a voluntary basis."
5/31/2010,"this is a game guys, it's not iranian politics where you have a risk to be hanged."
5/31/2010,blasphemy!!!everyone knows internet spaceships is serious business.
5/31/2010,"nope, but internet privacy is, even if it only relates to a game."
5/31/2010,"i worry that doing this might remove some of the support the csm has among players. partisans of a given candidate are already annoyed when that candidate loses, but how much more annoyed and bitter would they be if the results come in ""you finished #3 among old-timers, but didn't get a seat""? it seems likely to be nothing but divisive."

5/31/2010,"even though apparently i messed up my allpication and the e-mail i sent never arrived. i was never added to the election and i just saw i lost by a wide margin. to say that i am crushed beyond recovery i shall endevor to carry on the crusade for truth, just, and freedom for all! or at least the right to arm bears. yet again a pitafull small voice caling from the wilderness of the ""oppesive man"" is drowned out by the establishment. and crushed like a bug. ( on the plus side is that i avoid what is likely going to be a lot of paper work and chatting.)i would add that hose who did not vote (for what ever reason) don't get to complain about who did or didn't get elected. if you don't stand up and be counted then things will never change. all it takes for evile to prevail is that good men(woman) do nothing. (can't remember the author of that quote and i aploigise cause it isn't mine.well done and good luck to all that did run and to the winners. good bad or indifferent. at least you all stood up tried to be counted and took your best shot. that is and of it'self commenable. again well done fly well fly freeelf lord.ps some of you have noooooooooooooooooo sence of humour at all and need to learn how to chill out. personnally i recomend ludes or xanax maybe a valium or 2 or with your favorite taste beverage minus the pills. what ever floats your boat but realy folks you need to lighten up before you give yourselves a stroke. if there was an olimpic event for tight asses some of you would clean up on the medals. back to mining have fun and good luck all."
5/31/2010,"tldr, once the poor, abused platitudes are stripped away: you're too dumb to fill out a simple form properly, but it's the establishment keeping you down. and anyone who calls you on your idiocy is an olympic-class tightass who needs drugs.right."
5/31/2010,"thank you ever so much for proving my point for me. what no one seems to understand is that i asked and asked very nicely for a simple answer to a simple quetsion. the moderater could have settled the entire issue simply by answering my question. i also sent an e-mail as asked and that went no where. i was not the only person saying they had problems with the apps and e-mail.. there was no need to turn this whole thing into a flame war but since you started it i figured what the hell i was bored just mining so i defended myself and my beliefes. you and your pals instead of droping the subject and letting the moderator of this disscusion settle the issue you simply went ahead and contniued insulting me and just ****ing me off. are you wrong? i say hell ya. am i wrong? i say ya i suppose since i could simply have let you and yours bully me into going away. are we both wrong? damn skippy. is the moderater wrong for failing to control his/her forum damn straight.and if you loooked at what i wrote all of what i wrote you would have seen that unlike yourself i was gracious in my congradulations to the winners. pointed no figures, called no names, made light of the mistakes we all made in this and simply was willing to end things then and there. and wished everyone well in their endevors. you on the other hand simply see that yet again i am not fitting into your mentality and so attack me with no regard for the truth or letting sleeping dogs lay. god bless you and yours because i know there is a special place in heaven waiting for you and yours. of course since i am jewish i allready have a spot reserved in the hecklers section so i hope some day we meet in a bigger universe than this one.fly well but fly freeefl lord"
5/31/2010,and so did the voters.
