8/1/2014,"you're not a fan of alts or multiboxing, but you are pressing for the matter to have isboxer banned outright. hmm.. seems to be you're not just ""not a fan"" but outright hate the thing with a vengeance.if you won't try it out yourself, it means you're talking out of your ass. talking about stuff you've only seen or heard about and at that, you've only seen people who successfully do stuff. you don't see videos of people who failed miserably at using it, just like there aren't many pvp videos of people losing battles. same will killboards. there's a ton of kills missing so certain corporations killboards would look positive.isboxer looks simple, but it's not. you need to take a good lot of time to set everything up. that's the basic thing that is also pointed out in the readme. set it up first. it's not like windows explorer, install and it works. hell no. you need to set it up. try it. tweak it for different toons, etc etc. and like i told you in the quotation above, nobody shows the videos of how they failed with isboxer. nor are people willing to admit they spent 3 real time days to set everything up properly, so it's just net profit from now on."
8/1/2014,"isboxer ain't really just an simple alt is it.yea sure defenders of isboxer say how hard it is to set up. i guess people get that program for losing isks, right? oh wait, thats not true they get it cause they can get tons of isks by its help or blob someone solo. so for 3 days you have a bit rough time with it but than you can easily do anything solo. why playing multiplayer game anyway? just find yourself some nice sci-fi strategy. crying how bad is the isboxer when everyone knows for little trouble it gives you a huge advantage. just wow. why not make ok trade bots for example? i'm too lazy to trade properly so i'd like one. you also need to set it up so i guess it would be ok, right?"
8/1/2014,"3days till forever. i'm still tweaking my setup and i've had it for years. i also still have to deal with every single thing i stated above. if i can go a day without having to restore from backups then it's been a good day.i can get tons of isk a lot easier without isboxer. i actually isbox for the challenge. the isk i make in the process is enough to cover losses (which happen frequently) with a tidy profit left over. you can ban isboxer and i'd still multibox. people would still get blobbed soloed. eve isn't about fairness and almost no one really looks for a fair pvp fight. like i said earlier some look for ""fair"" fights but what they want is the illusion of fairness not an actual fair fight.bot that's where you should of stopped with your inane trade bot comment.i'll be back for the silly post by ltcol rtbutts later. it always cracks me up when someone claims they are the sole expert on computer systems and networks. bonus points for claiming to be an expert with a program and activity that he clearly has no real experience with."

8/1/2014,"forcing players attempting exploration to gimp their ships with hacking & archeology mods instead of a point/web does nothing but encourage the delineation between pvp players and pve players. if they weren't forced into dropping points and webs for otherwise useless modules, most would still be easy kills for experienced pvpers. however, this change would allow experienced pvp players to fit for both exploration and pvp...on purpose...without losing ship functionality for pvp. this would enable people to explore when the pvp is slow, and pvp targets of opportunity when they present themselves during explorationthere is no real point to insisting that people gimp their ships before exploring. anyone should be able to fly a t1 frigate into an exploration site and if another t1 frigate shows up and wants to fight, be able to actually bring a ""good fight"" instead of running away or just dying.why should be there pvp-only and pve-only mods at all?"

8/1/2014,little goon is scared of 1 little web and scram?
8/1/2014,"hello.because of this, i will propose a new idea to have an option in the popup window (after you press the 'declare war' button) where you have to search after corps or alliances to war dec and add an option to set -10 standing to everyone that we war dec. as we also want to have the standings back to what it was before the war started, ccp can also add another option that sets the standings back to the default ones when the wars is over.by adding those 2 options there, it will make it available to those who want's to use that (like us who don't have the time to set each corp / alliances to -10 in standing each weeks), and it will still work like it should for others who doesn't want to change the standings.this changes nothing for the corps or alliances that gets war dec'ed as they can still use the normal overview settings as normal. it will only change standings for those who uses those options. by doing this, we can just use check the 'pilots have terrible standing' option in our war targets overview tab. then we will only see the war targets there, witch is the thing we want to be able to do to sort out only the war targets in a seperate overview tab.those who have few war decs against someone can just set standings manually the normal way (like it is now) against those who war decs them (takes them some few minutes to change this for those who have few war decs going, so it's not an issue this way) without having to send out a war dec witch costs isks to be able to add a -10 standing in an easy way to be able to see only the war targets in the overview tab.so this is more of an option to those who does houndreds of war decs every weeks that needs to set the war targets to -10 in standings in an easy way to be able to correctly see the war targets on the overview.i'm sure the mercenaries who do war decs simply don't cares about the standings getting changed under a war against some corps or alliances as those who are getting war dec'ed are going to fight us anyways and will be blinky red no matter what.what do you think about this idea. will this works as a temporary solution or will this create other problems in the process?"
8/1/2014,+1. i approve of this message.
8/1/2014,"first problem i see is that not everyone wants to set -10 to their war targets. a war target doesn't inherently mean your standing is terrible. you may have differing degrees of war targets, so you may want to set your serious war targets to -10, and your low threat war targets to -5. groups like rvb for example may want to set their rvb war to -5.the second issue i see is that it wouldn't just be changing the aggressors standings, you'd be allowing the aggressor to trigger standing changes on the defender. this may mess up other standings based mechanics they have set up when they didn't want them to, like the use of pocos for example.most people have been happy with the current workaround of adding standings when a war is declared, leaving them complete control over their standings situation. i would suggest that the issue here isn't the workaround, but the number of wars a group is able to declare simultaneously for a trivial sum of isk. if the number of aggressive war declarations were limited or scaled in cost exponentially, it would prevent situations like this occurring in the first place, leaving no need for a further workarounds for the handful of corporations affected.edit:fair warning to any csm members planning on reading this: be warned that any time nightmarex was challenged in this thread, he reacted by screaming ""you don't understand"" and hurling personal attacks. most of what you will read will be repetitions of itself, and all in all the idea isn't worth championing as it would cause more harm than good."
8/1/2014,"again, it's a temporary fix (that actually works) until ccp have fixed all of the issues with the overview in the future.for those who does empire wars, this temporary issue will make perfectly sense as it doesn't mess up anything else for the war dec'ers.edit: you said this: most people have been happy with the current workaround of adding standings when a war is declared.that's because they don't do many war decs. try putting 230+ corps or alliances to negative standings manually every weeks and you will realize how troublesome this is."
8/1/2014,"it's still a temporary fix that would negatively impact a lot of players just to make it easier for a handful of groups. why should ccp push out a temporary fix for just a few people which would cause problems for others, when the existing workaround have been accepted by most for a long time? if you find that you have too many wardecs to use the existing mechanic, then reduce your number of wardecs.edit:exactly. most group don;t have 230+ wars (a rather ludicrous amount), so you want most people to accept a change which forces standings changes on them which they may not want and that may cause them problems, just to help a handful of groups who have declared too many wars. it seems to be unreasonably biased."
8/1/2014,"how would a -10 standing negatively affect those who are war dec'ed to begin with?the -10 standings wont go active before the wars is going active anyways. so once the war is active, it doesn't matter what standing they have as they will be blinky to us and they will be blinky to us. and when the war is over, the standing goes back to the normal standing we had before the war.so it wont matter at all.edit: good to see that you are on-topic so far. keep going that way."
8/1/2014,"some people use their standings, and would probably want to be able to set arrays of standings. some may hold pocos and not want to automatically deny usage to anyone that became involved in a war dec with them, especially since being at war doesn't necessarily mean aggression. wars can be transferred, so standings would transfer with them, even though they might not actually want to be at war with the group who it was transferred to.""it won't matter"" for you, but it may matter for other people. you have to look at a change from the perspective of others, and not just from the benefit it would provide you. i certainly wouldn't get behind an idea that removes choice from players just to help out a couple of groups."
8/1/2014,"how would it affect those who are war dec'ed when they will be attackable once the war goes active?yeah, they gets terrible standing under a war. why would that matter to them when all of their stuffs can be attacked anyways then?a -10 standing wont matter to them under a war, only outside of a war."
8/1/2014,"sorry, but i've already explained it. i don't know how i can explain more than some people do not want their standings set to -10 when someone decs them or when they dec someone else. some people want the choice of setting their standings and holding their standings the way they set them, and it's not only the overview that would be affected.your idea would remove that choice purely to help a couple of groups manage their overview settings because they've declared too many wars and can't manage their standings anymore."
8/1/2014,"what differences does it make to have a -10 standing under a war or not while you are blinky red anyways?if someone is at war, then the standing doesn't matter as everything they have is attackable anyways. this just changes some standings ingame to someone while someone is at war. it's simple. it doesn't change a single thing except for some numbers.and peoples are smart enough to figure out the differences by getting a negative standing to getting negative standing when they gets war dec'ed. it can even be described in the war dec mail you get that once the war goes active, your corp or alliance will get a -10 terrible standing.how hard can it be?edit: incase you are misunderstanding. the corp or alliance who gets war dec'ed by us isn't getting their own standings towards us / the war dec'ers adjusted. the standing will only be set / adjusted to those who war decs someone."
8/1/2014,"how can i explain it more? some people don;t want to set the standing to -10. some people want to filter their war targets. take for example rvb. they might want to have their other alliance set to -5, so that if they get attacked by a real war target,they can all switch to see only that war target rather than seeing each other too.also, again, standings affect more than just the overview. people don't necessarily want to set -10 to all war targets automatically, especially if the war is the result of a transfer.i understand that for you, it's a no-brainer, and would only be a positive change, but for other people it would have negative consequences and limit choice, so no, i do not support the change."
8/1/2014,read my edited reply in my earlier post.my idea doesn't change anything at all except for some standings that doesn't matters for us who war decs under a war.edit: i even edited my first post to cover this that this only applies to those who sends out war decs. those who gets war dec'ed wont see any differences or changes at all. they will just get an eve-mail where it says it takes 24 hours before the war goes active. the only difference here is that the eve-mail will say that they will be set to -10 to the war dec'ers once the war goes active.
8/1/2014,"even so, that would mean you can only wardec someone if you want to set -10, so again, how would groups like rvb with ""fun wars"" manage this?also, how would this work where wars are transferred, would it still not set to anyone but the initial aggressor?then further, this would then create an inconsistency, where a ""war target"" overview would suddenly not show all war targets if those war targets decced the defender instead. so people would now set up their overview, and they would show all their war targets fine, then suddenly someone that's not on their overview blows them out of the sky. this is would argue is even worse than it currently is.and again, this is only a good change for a couple of groups who have too many wars. this isn't really a great benefit to the majority of the game. why can't you just have less wars and manager your standings like everyone else?"
8/1/2014,"it's simple, you don't understand the proposal i'm talking about here.and if i want to war dec someone, does it matter if they are neutral or -10 to us then?and if i want to kill someone and war dec them, they will be as much dead as before with a -10 standing and those who are war dec'ed by us will still see us as blinky red as normal.so it doesn't matter at all as they will be my / our targets anyways then and will be blinky red no matter what then. the war for both parts will be the same war as before even with a -10 standing. this is the thing you don't understand.so what differences does it make except for a standing (that only get's adjusted for us who war dec) that doesn't matter to us or to those who gets war dec'ed under a war?if i get the marmite to set your alliance to -10 in standing, what does that change on your side?exactly, it changes absolutely nothing for both parts.i have played eve enough (since 2004) to not understand those things 100% in and out."
8/1/2014,"right, i do understand, so please don't be so rude. i understand that for your purposes a -10 standing with your war targets would only be a positive, and you wouldn't require any other standing settings, but that's just you. other people would not want to have their standings set in every instance. i've already explained why rvb would not want it for 2 totally different reasons for example.you have to look at it from other people's perspectives. not everyone has a black and white approach to war targets like you do. the freedom to choose the standing is important to some people, and you want to strip away that choice because you don't need it.i could do the same: why don't we just take away wars instead, i don't use them so why would it matter if they didn't exist? see how that makes absolutely no sense because it's completely biased to my view and neglects the needs of others? your suggestion has the same problem."
8/1/2014,"alright, when you finally have understood what i'm proposing, then can we all agree that i'm making this topic to see what kind of response i will get back independent of what you think of the proposal?you don't know how many that will support this or not. i know alot of peoples who are tired of those issues i'm talking about here and would gladly support this idea. so all i will say, give it time."
8/1/2014,"indeed i can see that. i however don't just think the idea has low support, but am actively against the removal of standing choice and am making that clear. other people can weigh in, but if i were you, i'd rethink the proposal altogether."
8/1/2014,"as this proposal only applies to the war dec'ers like i'm saying, i'm sure it doesn't matter if the war targets to us are neutral or -10 in standing. so it doesn't matters. so it's not about the freedom to choose standings as the standings for us doesn't matters under a war, but the freedom to be able to see our war targets the right way on the overview.that's the thing here ."
8/1/2014,"it doesn't matter to you. it matters to other people with war decs (example, rvb). you would be able to see wts in the overview like everyone else if you didn't have so many wars, or if you set standings yourself. so it seems like you could already resolve your issue though in-game means, by either spending the time sorting your standings (the bulk of which would only need to be done once) or by reducing your number of wars."
8/1/2014,"if we war dec rvb, it's only us who gets the standing adjustment. that wont affect rvb in any ways. so via the war dec'ers perspective, it doesn't change a single thing.if rvb is war dec'ing us, then rvb will get their standing to us adjusted to -10. and we will just see them as normal war targets. so what differences does it have to have a -10 standing under a war for someone?having -10 in standing or just be a normal war target, what changes does it makes except that your standing changes and you will still be able to fight as normal?again, nothing changes as those who actually have a -10 standing to begin with will be blinky red to the war dec'ers anyways and the other way to.so a neutral, +5, +10 standing towards someone will still turn up as a blinky red one a war goes active. once a war goes active, you turns blinky red independent of what standing you have to begin with."
8/1/2014,"if red decs blue, then they will be set to -10. if red then decs you, you will be set to -10. now if you attack while there are blue in system, they can't hide their ""fun war"" to focus on you, because you both have -10. and that's not the only reason you might want to change from -10. for example rvb might want to dec bni, but might want to still allow them to use their pocos at a normal standing.so again, it's not just how it affect it from you view, and again i will suggest: it seems like you could already resolve your issue though in-game means, by either spending the time sorting your standings (the bulk of which would only need to be done once) or by reducing your number of wars.standings don't only affect the overview. other mechanics are affected by standings. who are you to determine that all war targets should be -10 for all standings purposes?"
8/1/2014,"if red decs blue where red adjusts the standing to -10 to blue, then they will just see each others as normal war targets, aka blinky red. setting a corp standing to someone to -10 doesn't change anything on how someone sees someone under a war. under a war you are supposed to kill each others no matter the standings.when the war is over, you will automaticly gets the standing adjusted back to the default standing you had before the war, witch means that you can use the poco's in this case at normal standing and so on.if marmite sets your alliance to -10 in standing, what does that changes for us and you when you will turn up as blinky red (witch is the point of a war) anyways?"
8/1/2014,"yes, so while they are at war with both you and blue, they are completely unable to set up an overview that only shows you. see how that might be an issue? some groups prioritise targets by setting different standings and setting up different overviews to show those standings.and what if they want bni to be able to still use the poco before the war is over?"
8/1/2014,"if red have blue as -10 or the other way, you can still override that by getting everyone to show up correctly for them on the overview easily.when it's about the poco's, can't you just set invidual corps or alliances to be allowed to use the poco's even with a -10 standing by overriding the standing?as for rvb, they would only have to adjust this towards one single corp between each others witch takes seconds to fix.for us / others with over 100 different wars every weeks, it's a different story. it will takes us many hours to fix that. going from seconds to many hours is a big difference."
8/1/2014,"so this basically boils down to: because you can't be bothered to set your standings, other people will need to mess around with their standings when they get automatically set by war decs, not to mention that if the change were put in, it would create a clear inconsistency between aggressors and defenders?i think not. just sort your standings out like everyone else or cut down on your wars if you have too many. no temporary fixes required, you can do that right this moment if you wish."
8/1/2014,"you didn't read what i said. i said for rvb's case, they only have to adjust something towards one corp to each others inside the rvb.rvb wont allow others outside of them self to use their poco's anyways, so it's only between red and blue it's not the same case for us who have over 100 different wars every weeks where we have to change standings to each of the 100+ corps or alliances we war dec every weeks.yeah, rvb have to change some very few settings a single time towards red and blue to see each others the right way while we have to adjust those stuffs over 100 times each weeks. not hard to figure out that this isn't an issue at all when it comes to rvb.edit: ***** just got real, a massive amount of mercs (including us) in empire have war dec'ed rvb now."
8/1/2014,"yes, i did read, and it was basically along the lines of, you don;t want to adjust your settings manually, so you want them done automatically, and anyone that doesn't want that will have to set their manually instead. basically you want to make your problem everyone else's problem instead.and rvb pocos are open to anyone they have set red as far as i know.you only have to adjust yours so much because you choose to have too many wars. you put yourself in the situation you are in, so you can resolve it yourself. the system shouldn't be changed so that you can have an easier time while other people have to mess about. it's a selfish change.and why do i care if you decced rvb?"
8/1/2014,"again, why would someone care to adjust one thing a single time?we are comparing 1 time vs us who have to adjust this kind of things over 200 times at most every weeks. and rvb doesn't have to adjust this every weeks either. see the differences?it's about changing things for the better under a war. for rvb it wont matter to change something that takes you 1 minute at most while it will takes us half a day to adjust those things every weeks.just because we decide to have alot of wars, we shouldn't suffer to a broken overview. eve is a free game where you can do whatever you want and you should not get punished this way just because you have another playstyle than others. it should be as easy to play for everyone.what if our war target would bring in 100 neutrals / alts (that is blue to them so they don't appear on their overview) just to disrupt our ability to lock our war targets correctly just because the overview are broken for the most part for war dec'ers?that's the same as gaining an unfair advantage over others by a bad game mechanic that is broken just because someone decided to war dec alot of corps and alliances where others could use neutrals to disrupt us by messing up the overview."
8/1/2014,"but it;s not ""1 time"". it's ""1 time each time anyone who doesn't want it change declares war"". the fact that you have so many wars is your problem. you chose to have those wars. look, i'm not going to argue this all day with you, because as usual, you have absolutely no idea how to look at things for any perspective than your own. so this is the last post unless others chime in, and heres the list:1. it's a selfish change, which would benefit you at the detriment of others.2. it creates a divide between the settings of aggressors and defenders which is likely to lead to people not realising that some targets will not be shown in their overview (worse than now).3. the change is only needed because you have too many wars and you can't be bothered to deal with the consequence of doing that.4. it's automatically adjusting settings which people like to control manually, which affects far more than just the overview, eliminating choice and potentially causing further issues.3 is a pretty big one. you want hundreds of wars, complex management is your consequence. why should it be made even easier for you just because you can't be bothered to put in the leg work for the situation you chose?"
8/1/2014,"1. no, it only makes the war targets shows up correctly on our overviews, so it does denefits everyone who does wars.2. once a war goes active against someone, they will turn up blinky red to the war dec'ers independent of the standings they have before the war decs are sent out.3. war dec'ing should be as easy for everyone. there shouldn't be any differences just because you decide to have more war decs than others. so ccp fix the issues so this can be as easy to manage for everyone. just because issues appears for those who does alot of war targets, we shouldn't be punished for that because ccp are lazy to fix the issues. yes, those issues are fixable and should be fixed. why shouldn't ccp fix the issues with the overview to begin with?4. peoples who sends out war decs doesn't cares about what the standings is at as i have clearly explained earlier in this topic.because once the war goes active, they will turn up blinky red witch is the whole point. so they don't care what the standings are before the war as they are going to shoot the targets no matter what.for rvb it's only a one time change on how red appears to blue and the other way. once that is done, they will still appear like they should towards each others when they start a war against each others.this proposal doesn't change a single thing except that red and blue have to change some few settings one time."
8/1/2014,"ok, so 1 more 1. no, it makes it easier for groups like you. groups who like to vary their standings - even on war targets - have more to do.2. yes, except you states it doesn't change for the defender. so if i am in a corp that has started war decs, i set up a wt overview. now if someone declares against us, they will be invisible on my overview if we don't set their standing. that's inconsistent behaviour, which is bad.3. no, it shouldn't. if you choose to have 200 wardecs, you should have to do 200x the work. you can't be bothered and want it to be automatic so you can wardec as much as you like effortlessly. well tough. choices have consequences, and you made your choice. personally i think there should be even more downsides to having hundreds of wars.4. not all of them. you explained how you feel about it. you are not everyone.and that's it./thread"
8/1/2014,"1. explain why it doesn't benefits others who does war decs when all who does war decs want to see the war targets correctly in their overviews in the same way as they see neutrals the correct way in the overview?2. if marmite war decs your alliance or the other way around, you / i will now appear as red blinky war target on the overview in the same mess with another 1 million neutrals if you are fighting in empire. this applies to everyone who just sends out war decs.with my proposal, you can now sort out the war targets only in a seperate overview tab as you can just activate 'pilots with terrible standings' in that overview tab and wooosh, you will only see the corps and alliances with a -10 standing / terrible standing or those who are at war to you. this benefits both sides as it eases up the fighting as you can now concentrate on clicking on the war targets you are going to fight instead of messing around with another 55739579 neutrals where you might misslock someone and have to unlock them and so on.3. if i decide to have 4 wars or 500 wars, it should still be the same in war decing someone. or let me take it this way. would you like it to have it so the bigger your alliances get, the longer times it takes to build capital ships / pos'es or stations?would that be fine as a punishment because you decided to join a massive alliance that are bigger than others?no, it wouldn't.4. to be fair, i would make another easy solution. when you press the declare war button, you should get a popup where you can search after those you want to war dec. when you press the corp or alliance you want to war dec, you should get a new option in that popup where you can choose to set the corp or alliance to -10 before you sends out a war dec to them.this way, rvb can choose to ignore the -10 standing and rather let those who want to use that temporary fix to use that to ease up the fighting in overview."
8/1/2014,"i edited my first post and also changed the subject of the topic to the new proposal here (it's pretty much the same with some small changes).this new proposal with 2 new options under the popup window you get when you are pressing the 'declare war' button is optional to everyone. if you decides to use the 2 new options, it will only affect you who sends out war decs and no one else. if you don't decides to use it, you can just keep doing what you are doing as normal. this wont affect rvb at all as they have the option to rule out the -10 standing when they sends out the war decs to each others.so what do you think about that lucas?"

8/2/2014,"i'm complaining about the eve client and the servers. unless somehow it's been decided that the eve client is a third party program. if anyone is ignoring how servers, systems and the internet works it's you. it's blatantly obvious you've never tried to use isboxer to manage a fleet. also you have either never used more then one client at the same time or you're just pretending everything was perfect. i'm going to assume you're not a willful liar trying to make a point through deception. as such i'll attempt to help you see what really happens when you multibox.you know how when you're running one eve client that sometimes the game will freeze for anywhere from a microsecond to many seconds? don't try to claim that eve never lags on you. i've seen top end i7 systems with solid ssd setups exhibit the system lag/freeze (albeit very briefly). this momentary lag is even more likely when you're in a fleet combat situation. since many times more assets are required to load when fleets are fighting. now take that times however many clients you're running. when you're running a fleet overall system responsiveness decreases greatly compared to a single client. so it's extremely easy for the mouse cursor to lag just enough on one or more clients to cause the wrong target to be selected or for the wrong warp off destination to be selected etc. since you're forced into using the overview for target selection even a slight lag can result in you shooting yourself. then there's the whole issue of having to wait on the slowest client in your weapons/ewar/etc setup before you can fire again. even with a boss system you will experience varying levels of system and internet/server lag on each client. that is why you're forced into making slow deliberate movements of the mouse and why you're required to delay clicking up to several seconds. compared to a single client you're moving muccch slower and clicking a lot slower as a multiboxer.speaking of a problem that afflicts us all (server/internet lag). i can't tell you the number of times i've had partial socket resets on my fleets. anywhere from one to the majority of clients can just socket reset for no apparent reason. the pings between ccp and i can look absolutely beautiful and yet a client or more will d/c out of 10 clients. hell i've had two clients running on a beautiful day and one client will just be sloppy when it comes to responding. these issues hit multiboxed fleets harder because we're just one person trying to get however many clients to agree on doing the same thing. the more complex your isbox setup the more vulnerable you are to crashes and such.i follow the kiss rule in life when it comes to many things including computers. i keep my isbox setup simple because going complex just leaves me more vulnerable to various things. granted my complex setup does run sites a bit smoother assuming everything is going well. once something minor goes wrong though that complex setup can be difficult to recover with. being an oldschool multiboxer i'm very skilled in the handling of multiple clients with none of the fancy stuff anyway."
8/2/2014,i like this!
8/2/2014,"there is only 1 fix for null-sec: fw sov mechanics, but then on bigger scale.complexes should be: medium, large and x-large (for capitals)pro's:1. in fw sov mechanics there are no timers.2. you can still use your supers to bash the i-hub once vulnerable3. if people are not defending their system actively even small alliances can make it vulnerable.4. there will be a lot of traffic in 0.0 to run the complexes for either offensive or defensive plexing.this will bring a lot of pvp in space. ( and no you wont be able to run the plexes in stabbed frigates.) you will at least need a cruiser sized or a very well fitted dessie for the medium complexes, the larges and x-larges will need cruisers and up.people wont be farming for lp, instead both offensive and defensive should get a preset amount of isk out of the alliance wallet that is determined by the alliance itself. pilots that are not in an alliance can not run the complexes. that way the alliance can reward the pilots that are working for them to get sov. the more sov an alliance would have the more they would have to pay to their defending pilots. so holding more sov would mean more costs. this would mean small alliances have a chance too at a smaller scale.pilots will get paid for defending and offending systems and you dont need srp anymore since people can pay for their ships with the isk made from the sov war.the better they are at pvp and the more systems they take the more isk the pilots make.that way pilots can make is fighting for sov.making isk with pvp. ideal world."
8/2/2014,"if i had a dollar for every time some customer was wrong, i'd not have to work. good doesn't mean giving in to stupid demands.i'm glad you got your **** back though. that's nice."
8/2/2014,"wait, this rage was over a stealth bomber?lol ""ccp gief back my pocket change naow!!!!"""
8/2/2014,"what about fw?ccp wants people to move out of high sec and try low and null. baiting them out there with pve is a good idea. fw accomplishes this but if we want to go exploring, we must gimp our ships to pvp-fail level before going into what is basically a ""pvp zone"". it sends a mixed message. ""come to the pvp zones for the exploration pve! (but first, gimp your ship's pvp effectiveness so that you won't stand a chance in a 1 on 1 fight against the same hull.)""to participate in exploration in something other than a t3 outside of high sec we can only bring ""victim"" fail-fits? pass."
8/2/2014,"i can't say i like this idea. i get your issue; you have a lot of wars and a lot of standings to manage. the problem is more the amount of wars you have, not so much the system. you just have too many to handle; that's your problem. don't make it ours.groups like rvb don't want to auto -10 every war target, for the reason lucas explained. perhaps marmaite doesn't use the standings system for anything else than overview convenience; but rvb for example uses it a lot more extensively. i know of plenty of other corps that have done the same. first things that come to mind is access to pocos, infrastructure, .... being at war doesn't mean you want to block people from using the facilities you have available.i don't think something which works as it is; should be changed. if you decide to send out 230+ war decs, you deal with it."
8/2/2014,"i don't think you fully understand what the problem is. it doesn't matter how many wars you have. before you can get the war targets only to show up on the overview in a seperate overview tab, you have to set 1) personal -10 standings to everyone you war dec, 2) set corp standings to -10 to everyone you war dec or 3) set alliance wide standings to -10 to everyone you war dec.it should be enough to just war dec someone to get the war targets only to show up correctly on the overview if you have edited a seperate overview tab to show only war targets. why do we have to mess around with standings for many hours each weeks to be able to get them to show up like they should for us?you can create a seperate overview tab to show drones, wrecks, pos'es and so on only, so why can't we do the same with war targets?the fact is that you shouldn't have to touch the standings at all to be able to see the war targets correctly on the overview. so the only easy way is to temporary fix this like this until ccp fixes the issues with the overview by adding those 2 options in the 'declare war' popup window as i did write about in my first post. by doing this temporary fix, ccp can relax a bit more and use more time to fix the issues with war targets in the overview and make sure they fix the issues for good this time.here you will rather get an option in that popup window where you can enable the 'add -10 in standing to active war decs' where the standing automaticly will be added to -10 when we sends out the war and the war goes active against someone.as we don't really want to have everyone at -10 in standing after each wars, you will also have an option called 'automaticly sets the standings to those you war dec'ed back to the standard standings you had before the war started when the war is over' or something like that to see the non-wartargets as normal again.those 2 options wont change anything except for doing an easy workaround of the issues with the overview when it comes to the war targets there. those who doesn't needs to use them doesn't have to use them if they don't have many war targets and can handle the overview as it is. but it's also available to those who do alot of war decs (like us in marmite) to be able to see the war targets only on a seperate overview tab without having to change a million things ingame to be able to see them correctly.so this is nothing more than just the best workaround option to date to fix the issues with war targets.now, the war targets isn't the only problem here in the overview. the criminals, suspects, globals and outlaws does have the same problems to. but they are usually few in the same overview, so it's not an issue to handle that.so it's most important to be able to fix the issues with war targets first of all."
8/2/2014,yeah the overview settings with respect to wts has been borked ever since i can remember. i don't get why fixing a bug has to be so contentious.
8/2/2014,"my response,lawl!!! take 5 minutes and make a wt overview like everyone else. when you do more than sit under 1-2 stations, your standing levels actually mean something. to you, wt's come to you because you are only in jita, amarr, and 1-2 systems in its pipe. for us larger alliances you wardec we have more important things to do than visit the hubs, we have active reds to fight. the odds of seeing you in our systems are exactly nil. therefore the change in standings are just a pain that does not need to happen. standings are for a reason, you have different icons for wt's in overview for a reason. create a filter and don't be lazy."
8/2/2014,"ok ladies and gentlemen. here we have a player who have never done wars in empire, lol.what you say here sarius doesn't work bro. you have to enable the 'pilots with no standings' option under the overview settings to be able to show the war targets in your overview. there is no ways around this. and everyone knows what happens when you enable that. yes, you wont only see your war targets then.you have to add personal, corporation or alliance wide standings of -10 to those you war dec to override this. and it's here the problem is as you shouldn't have to set standings to be able to sort out the war targets in an overview tab.come back when you know what i'm talking about."
8/2/2014,"i see you modified your original post to something like this:when putting in a wardec, it would be cool to have a little check box on the popup screen that reads 'automatically set this target to -10 for the duration of the war'.alright, that makes more sense. it leaves the option for players to leave the standings as they are and it offers a 2nd option for entities who would like -10 for their war targets instead. this i can understand. that said, rather than adding in this; i would like to see an overview tab with just war targets; regardless of standings. that would pretty much just sort everything out. what really needs to be done here is fix the overview, not add in new features to go around current shortcomings.cva is also one of the oldest alliances in the game, i wouldn't exactly say they don't know what empire war is like. :p"
8/2/2014,"yeah i totally agree here.well, someone seems to not have the ability to read my topic, so someone missunderstands totally what i'm proposing here. not a suprise that someome might take them as complete noobs."
8/2/2014,what bounty do those reds have? 1...2 mil
8/2/2014,"they usually do not have any bounty because in nul when you battle you fight, you die, and you say gf in local without setting bounties like a damn fool (and yes i understand you meant npc rats)."
8/2/2014,"agreed. *stares at nightmarex*the problem here is still that you have too many wars. you should have to put in 200x the effort to set yourself up, because that's the consequence of taking on way too many wars. if ccp are to put in a change to make it trivial for you to do your setting up, then you should be restricted on how many wars you are allowed. it seems pretty silly to allow you to declare war on every nub industrial corp in the game, and not have any downsides at all."
8/2/2014,"or maybe the problem is that you don't have iq enough to understand the issues with the overview?if i war dec 5 corporations, it shouldn't be any different from war decing 200 corporations. war dec'ing is war dec'ing in the same way as isk whoring is isk whoring and shouldn't be any different on how you see it in the amount of war targets or isk you get.edit: there is nothing in eve that's called to many wars or whatever. or does it says somewhere that you can have to many peoples in your fleet to or what?eve is an open game where you can do exactly the things you want. you are completely free to war dec one corp or 500 corps. it should't be any different from sending out 1 war dec to 500 war decs.you are an idiot (sorry to say it, but it's the hard facts) if you believe there should be differences how we see the war targets on the overview just because someone decided to war dec more than others."
8/2/2014,i'll ask about it.
8/3/2014,"helloduring discussions with my corporation, we have come up with a couple of ideas that we think should be added to eve.1) an alarm that can be set for a full ore bay on a mining ship. like the tones that can be set for shield and armor damage, we would like to have tones that warn when our ship's ore bay becomes full.2) war declaration and cool down periods on the corporation calendar. all corp members receive the eve-mails sent when the corp is war decked. we would like to see this information our our calendar as well. we already see calendar posts automatically made for pos tower fuel issues.thank youmarcus vannosh"
8/3/2014,"hi there,they sound not crazy, the first one poeple will complain that it promotes afk mining, but i get what you mean, and the second one u can do manually ofc, but i get the idea. there is a ideas and suggestions forum section , maybe a forum admin can move this one there"
8/3/2014,my soe frig is a beast in pvp and it has the ability to hack/scan. i dont consider it gimped and nore do the people that thaught they had an easy kill...at the end of the day if you want the loot in the arc/data can then go fitted for it. also mobile fitting hanger is your friend
8/3/2014,"first, pirate frig. so much for exploration with a realistic pvp fit in a t1 frigate. isn't exploration supposed to be new player friendly?second, mobile fitting hangar as an answer kills the idea of a fast-paced game. ""oh, a frigate on d-scan, landing on grid... take the fight in seconds? nope. i'll go refit, and hope this frigate is still on grid in a few minutes."" *yawn*your work-arounds are a) buying a pirate faction frigate hull for 85 million isk, and gimping it, but it can still (shockingly) beat 1 million isk t1 frigs, even when gimped or b) losing fight opportunities to go refit. how are either of your alternatives to my suggestion better for the game?"
8/3/2014,"see, and you leap straight back to personal attacks. and you really expect people to take you seriously?i'll make it clear. i completely understand that the current state of the overview makes it difficult to set up overviews showing war targets as you need to set up standings. for most people this is not a problem. if it takes x about of time to set up a corp, then a corp with 5 wars takes 5x time to set up their stuff. a corp with 10 wars takes 10x. so a corp with 200 wars should take 200x time to set it up. the game shouldn't be made easier for you just because you want to do 200 things at once. i can't set up trading orders 200 at a time either, so it takes me more time to set all my orders in comparison with a guy trading a handful of items, like it should.so yes, it's should be vastly different between setting up 1 war and setting up 500 wars. if you want to do more, you should have to work more, not be aided by automatic mechanics. it's really that simple. so yes, you should be able to do what you want, but you should have to live with the consequences of those choices.and no, i'm not an idiot (nice personal attack again) just because i disagree with you. your idea is badly thought out, and designed to fix a problem that affects only a handful of players (who have made a choice to declare hundreds of wars) while introducing a number of other issues.now if you can't be civil, keep your mouth shut."
8/3/2014,"the simple fix, would be for ccp to actually enable the overview to work correctly as in the past.why should they waste time creating this fix and making life even harder for others?destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
8/3/2014,"i imagine that since the bug is so old it's probably built into the old codebase making it less simple to fix, which is why it's been an issue for so long.the thing is though, very few people would actually use it, most people just set standings anyway, and if they did fix it, we'd probably have a period of ""oh wow, where'd everyone on my overview go"" and ""why does my overview not seem to want me to know i'm shooting blues?"" for a while. so is it really worth the time to fix at this stage in comparison with all the other improvements that would have much more impact?"
8/3/2014,"and you haven't already done that like a million times already?and you expect that someone will take you seriously then?no, it takes you more times to war dec more or sending out the war decs. it shouldn't take you more time to set up something that will make the war targets to appear the right way on the overview when a war target is a war target on the overview. a war target will still be the same war target on the overview independent of how many we war dec. war decs is a part of the game and sending out 200 war decs should take you 200 times more time over just sending out 1 one war dec. that's how it is now and it should be like that. it shouldn't be 200 times harder to find the war targets in the overview over how you just see the war targets with just one war dec on your overview.or would it make sense to make it harder for players to find npc's or rats in the overview as more npc's or rats there is in a mission?that would be awesome, right?that would absolutely keep new peoples to this game aaaaaaaaaaaaaaal the time.there should be absolutely no need to do a setup of how you see the war targets in overview. it should be as easy to see the war targets in overview if you war dec 250 corps or alliances as it is easy to see the war targets by just sending out one war target. it should be an option in the overview settings that will enable a seperate overview tab that will show only the war targets.having complicated setups in eve isn't really there to make eve an intresting game for new peoples. before the game will be more intrested for new players, the game needs to be more easy to get into. and as far as i know, the overview is a complete mess and a big confusion to new players. the overview setup as you will see it the first time you undock haven't been changed in many many years.it needs to be changed for the better and not continue to stay messy just because someone have huge understanding issues to see where the issues with the overview is. luckily, the overview settings have got a pretty nice overhaul on the test server already, so keep saying the overview wont get fixed bro.no, making things more difficult just because someone decides to war dec more corps or alliance than others, or to make the game harder for peoples just because they just want to be in a bigger fleet is driving peoples away from the gane and not into the game. you have to be somekind of a genious to not see this. seriously.when it comes to the knowledge about eve, yes you are that, by a long shot. because i don't know someone else that are as clueless about the overview as you are. because you have shown it here times after times (or in my earlier topic about this) that you have never ever done empire pvp or war decs at all and don't have an iq enough to figure out how the overview works and don't know where to look to see where all of the issues are in the overview. those peoples who don't find issues with the overview the within first 3 hours they are playing eve and are using the overview is not changing anything on the overview at all.it's that simple.well, you can't expect others to be nice with you when you have a massive tantrum trolling fest here where you cries like a mofo. don't expect others to be nice with you when you simply don't understand eve and just spews out stupid troll arguments."
8/3/2014,"ccp have done some pretty nice changes to the overview settings on the test server now. so i will be testing it out now to see if there is any fixes or improvements there. who knows, they might have fixed the issues with the war targets on the overview already?oh also, how is adding 2 optional options when you are going to war dec someone gonna make it harder for others?it doesn't, as it makes it easier for players to see the war targets correctly on the correct overview tab on the overview.edit: yes ofc ccp should fix the issues with the overview. that should be their first priority. but as i believe that they might be using another 5 years to finally fix it, i'm rather proposing a temporary fix (that is easy for ccp to add in eve) that ccp can add in the next major patch or something. as this is an easy fix to put into eve, it will actually free up ccp a little with this temporary fix to let them use more time to actually fix the issues with the overview where they can make sure to use more time to really fix the issues in the overview for real this time."
8/3/2014,"please point out where in this thread i'm attacking you.any time someong disagrees with you, you call them stupid. your opinion isn't automatically right because you said it, so get over it. if you can't stop throwing around personal attack,s then go back to c&p, and troll on there. i'm pretty certain the csms aren't interested in watching you call the rest of the player-base idiots.at the moment, when you set up a wardec, you set up the standing at the same time. so yes, that should take you 250x more time if you want 250x more wardecs.it should be more difficult. you choose to have 250 wardecs, so you choose to take on the challenges that brings on. the problem is, you want the game to do it all for you. you want to reap the rewards, but don;t want to put in the effort. tough.look mate, people aren't idiots just because they disagree with you. i don't agree that you should be given all of the automatic help you ask for. i don;t think that choices in this game should be without consequence. that doesn't make me an idiot. now keep your damn tongue civil.how am i trolling? i'm putting across my opinion, and you are attacking me. so who's the one trolling here, huh?"
8/3/2014,"you are attacking me because you refuse to accept that there is alot of issues with the overview and think that it's normal to be like it is now. that's where the problem is.and that's where you have massive issues to understand that you shouldn't have to setup any standings to see your war targets correctly in the overview.do you have to setup standings to see npcs on the overview?no you don't have to, and that's my point.and answer me this. would you like it to be 250 times more harder to see your enemies on your overview correctly by being in a fleet of 250 peoples over how you are seeing your enemies on the overview by being alone in your own fleet?it shouldn't, and it shouldn't be any harder to see your war targets just because you war dec more than others. it isn't any harder to see your enemies the more that joins your fleet either, so why should it be more difficult to see our war targets correctly the more we war dec?oh also, standings has nothing to do with wars to do. a war is a tool that goes outside of the standing system as they will be blinky red after a war goes active independent of what the standings are. you shouldn't have to change anything with the standings to see the war targets because of this.or do you want me to put up a new proposal here that makes it harder for you to find your enemies in your overview the more peoples that joins your fleet?that sounds like a good idea. do you want me to create it?ahh damn, that's a genious idea as that would probably reduce the blobbing in eve to.ok, let's make a new topic about my new proposal where we can make it harder for you to find your enemies the more peoples that joins your fleet. deal?yeah, you want the game to do it all for you. so why not change the game for the better and make this harder for everyone?dude, disagreeing that there isn't any issues with the overview when it comes to war targets is like being asked to be called an idiot. it's your choice to be taken as this as you don't understand eve. if you don't understand eve and don't understands the problems, then why are you in this topic to begin with?the fact that you don't see it yourself makes it even more obvious that you aren't playing this game bro.it's not an opinion that there is issues with the overview as it have been bugged for alot of years now. anyone who disagrees with this haven't used the overview for anything."
8/3/2014,"wrong. i accept that the overview doesn't work entirely as it should, i just don;t think it's a priority change, i don't think your temporary fix is suitable, and i think that when it is fixed, there has to be another change to restrict people from effortlessly wardeccing hundreds of people.why shouldn't you have to? it's part of wardecs. you don;t have to set up npc, because that's a completely different mechanic. you can't take 250 missions from the same agent at the same time, so for each one you have to redock, hand in, take new mission. for you wardecs it's the same. for each wardec you have to set it up, then at the end unset it. if it was automatic and effortless like you want, then there would be no downsides to declaring wars on hundreds of noob corps.go ahead, see how it does. you are making comparison where comparisons do not exist.when have i said there's no issues? i've clearly stated that there are issues, they are just low priority, and will need to go hand in hand with changes that restrict war declarations, to add consequence to groups making decisions like yours does.again, just because my opinion is different from yours does not suddenly mean i'm wrong and that i'm not playing or i'm not paying enough attention. you need to learn to accept that other people have opinions too, and that those opinions are just as valid. if you can't accept that, you have absolutely no right to be posting in this section of the forum. your behaviour here certainly isn't going to encourage a csm to champion your idea."
8/3/2014,"and if the overview doesn't work like it should, then we should be able to apply easy workarounds until ccp have fixed the issues with the overview. and my proposal here is the easiest temporary fix so far. it's easy and fast to put this into eve.you are free to disagree on this, but at least give explanations on why it wouldn't be a good idea to do this. if not, no one is going to listens to you. i have given many valid reasons why it's a good idea to put this into eve.ccp have used alot of different temporary fixes in eve before that goes around the problems until ccp have properly fixed the problems. so they are fully able to do the same now, so my idea is a good idea as it makes the war targets appear the correct way on our overviews, like it should.you say you think it's a low priority change to fix the overview settings?ahh, so that's why ccp have given the overview settings on the test server an overhaul already?you aren't really genious to say it that way. because if you had spent at least 5 mins to do some searching, you will see that the issues with the overview is a high priority for ccp. the thing is that it takes times to fix those issues and it can appear to be a low priority because it takes so long time to fix it. but it's not the case as the test server shows now.standings have nothing to do with war decs. as the standings is overrided by the war decs anyways, then it doesn't matter what the standings is, so why should the standings matters in a war then?explain this, smartass?sure. it will do great as you will support it and many of your carebear friends will like it. yeah, making eve a harder game to play is what you want, right?yes, there are issues with the overview like i have said, then why are you refusing to get the issues with the war targets to appear correctly on the overview to be fixed then?everyone knows there is issues with the overview, so why are you still trolling and saying standings should matters in a war when it shouldn't. you can have your opinions yes, but as it's facts that there is tons of issues with the overview settings makes your opinion here invalid bro. you have your opinions while i have the facts about the overview settings. because it's a fact that there is issues with war targets in the overview.opinions vs. the facts i have. it's not hard to see who's right and wrong.lastly, i have an opinion that you don't use the overview at all. does that makes me to be right about it when you know it's not true."
8/3/2014,"first off, yes it should be fixed, when there is capacity to do so and when it's a priority, which it isn't.secondly, your ""easy fix"" contains automatic standing adjustments based of an option placed when a war is declared. i'm pretty sure that isn't as simple as you think it is.thirdly, i and others have given you several very good explanations, and you've simply ignored them. you can;t just ignore everything other people say because you don't think it's valid.if it was a high priority, it wouldn't be a bug that is years old, and you would have people here supporting you.well obviously standings do have something to do with wardecs, since everyone using wardecs is using standings.because that's not the topic. the topic here is that you are too lazy to put in the legwork to support your hundreds of wardecs.lolso once again, you've jumped to the conclusion that what i say is opinion, and what you say is fact. even though other people here agree that your idea is terrible.you are not a special snowflake, what you say is no more valid that what anyone else says. stop acting like you are somehow more right than everyone else. your idea is terrible, several of us have explained why, and you need to accept that you aren't right purely because you think you are."
8/3/2014,"i'm not going to keep getting into these wall of text arguments with you, so either be constructive, or i'm just going to tl;dr your posts. i've had quite enough of you throwing a tantrum, and lobbing personal attacks around every time someone doesn't agree with you. if you want to do that, head on over to gd or c&p. don't waste the csms time with your utter inability to see things from other people point of view and your selfish desires to make your own playstyle easier."
8/3/2014,1. it's enough priority that ccp is already fixing / changing stuffs with the overview on the test server.take a look at those pictures.
8/3/2014,"i'm more special than you as i know where the problems / issues is and i know that those issues are affecting the overview on how it shows the war targets. and as i know how to temporary fix the issues, i'm also more special than you as you can't even figure out that the overview have issues that needs to be fixed.edit: i will give you one more chance to stay serious here. now you are just trolling. be warned."
8/3/2014,"so quit crying and see if they fix it. when they do you can be damn sure i'll be pushing for change to wardec mechanics to make it harder again for you guys to just wardec everyone.and it still doesn't make it an easy fix. it also still creates a divide between behaviour in an aggressor corp and expected behaviour for others. if people expect the war target stuff to just work, because their corp leader sets it, then if they are in another corp that doesn't set it, or if someone decs them, their overview suddenly won;t work the way they expect.grow up. just grow up. me not agreeing does not mean i do not understand. do you get that? do you know how that works? do you understand what a difference of opinion is?here it is as simply as it can be put:stop assuming people do not understand simply because they disagree with you. your opinion is no more correct that anyone else's."
8/3/2014,"no, you clearly do not understand the issues as well as you thought you did. clearly people have posted issues with your proposal here, and you've just ignored themand give me one more chance before what? what are you going to do, report me for not agreeing with you? good luck with that one.this is a serious forum, designed for people to lay out serious proposals and for people to discuss their merits. people are allowed to disagree with you. just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's trolling. what makes it even funnier is that you have thrown several personal attacks at me throughout this thread, calling my iq into question, calling me an idiot, calling me stupid and repeatedly telling me that i just don't understand."
8/3/2014,"no, because as i have said, the more peoples who complains about this the faster they will fix the issues. you can't be old in this game if you haven't figured this out yet.it's an easy fix as it 1) fixes the issues with war targets in the overview for those who want to see the war targets correctly on the overview. 2) is optional to use, so no one is forcing you to use the options. again, it's the easiest fix possible as a temporary solution and it's easy to put this code into eve. 3) doesn't gives any drawbacks or other issues back for using those 2 options. it will only affect the corp who sends out war targets, so it's only up to them to choose how they want to run their corp or alliance.saying it's not valid isn't an explanation, it's an opinion.this guy gave an explanation:"
8/3/2014,"if someone doesn't understand the problem, they can still disagree with me, but don't expect me or someone to agree with peoples who doesn't understands the issues. therefore, i'm right in disagreeing with those who have no clues."
8/3/2014,"except there not ""more people"", there's just you. you throwing personal attacks at people and expecting that to make the csm take you seriously.there clear are drawbacks, as have been detailed at great length, you have simply ignored the concerns. and regardless, it doesn't make it easy to put into the game.wrong. i do understand. i honestly don't care if you think i understand or not. several people have explained why your idea is terrible and you've simply ignored them. but that really doesn't matter. what matters is the csm will take one look at you attacking people and screaming ""you don't understand"" and they will realise that you are not to be taken seriously. i call for a thread lock, since this is not going to go anywhere."
8/3/2014,"1. and what issues have peoples posted about my proposal here?saying it's not valid isn't giving explanations on what the issues with my proposal is bro.2. no, i have already reported you for trolling and for not discussing what the topic is about as you brings in that my proposal automaticly forces standings upon someone when i have clearly stated in my subject of the topic and in my first post that those 2 options are optional to use.therefor, you are taking the topic off-topic. so yes, you are reported for these reasons.1. trolling.2. not reading my topic.3. taking the topic off-topic.3. my proposal is pretty damn good here as long as someone can't give a good explainations on why it would be a bad idea."
8/3/2014,"you can't expect someone to take you seriously when you are....1. trolling.2. not discussing what my topic is about.3. taking it off-topic.expect to be flamed back.what are the drawbacks?that they forces standings upon someone when it's optional to use?i'm mean, come on.you don't, because if you had been understanding it you would figure out where the issues are.your post is again reported for trolling and for taking it off-topic."
8/3/2014,"people have explained in great detail, myself included. just because you haven't bothered to read it doesn't mean it's not been explained. i'm not going to copy paste what you can go back and read now.we are discussing the topic. the only time it goes off is when you start personally attacking me or when you start telling me i just don't understand. that's not a constructive way to post.clearly you are unable to take criticism on any level, so perhaps posting proposals in this part of the forum is not the best idea for you.1. i haven't trolled at any point2. not a rule, but i have been reading. seems you might need to do the same.3. not the case. the only person dragging this off topic is you with your personal attacks.so report away.it's good in your opinion. other people clearly disagree, and you can't accept that. any time someone explains what the problem are you just start telling them they don't understand, as if your ideas must be infallible, so therefore everyone else must be wrong."
8/3/2014,"proof or it never happened. you use this excuse to not bother to go back because you can't find any explanations. therefor, you will get reported the 3rd time for trolling.no, you are discussing forcing automatic standings towards war targets when i'm talking about something totally different. i'm not talking about forcing anything towards war targets as my proposal is about adding 2 options that is optional to use. so yes, you are taking my topic off-topic. so, you are reported.with pleassure.1. see quote 1 and 2. yes you are trolling.2. even though you ""might"" have been reading it, it doesn't automaticly means you will understand it.3. that's your opinion. i'm just posting this stuffs because you are.1) trolling.2) posting about something that my topic isn't about (yes about forcing standings towards war targets when it's not forcing to add options).3) taking my topic off-topic.it's good reasons as i understands the problems and have explained how the issues is and where they appear. you haven't explained why it's a bad idea.so because you can't explain this, you are taken as a troll. so like i've said, you are reported."
8/3/2014,"lol, grow up. the answers are already in this thread. even if i were to go back and link it all here, you'd still complain it's invalid.and you realise you are abusing the report function if you are reporting me fro trolling simply because i don't agree with you, right?no, that's not at all what i said. what i stated is that by having it an option and by having it only on the aggressor side, that you are creating inconsistent behaviour that is likely to lead to targets not showing up on the overview. when that happens, it will be worse than it is now, and the complaints of ""that guy didn't show up"" will pour in.yes i have, you simply haven't read it. and enjoy abusing the report feature by reporting me disagreeing with you. i'm certain that will end well for you. especially when they read the thread and see the many times you've hurled personal attacks at me while i've tried to keep the thread civil."
8/3/2014,"i can't find the answers in this topic. can you?i'm free to use the report function as much as i like when someone is trolling, talking about something different than my topic is about and for taking it off-topic. you are just mad because i can report you for doing those 3 things.no, the only thing those 2 options is doing is to make sure the war targets appear correctly in a seperate 'war target' overview tab. you creates a new overview tab called 'war targets' and only enables 'pilots with terrible standings' for that tab. by doing that, you will only see the war targets in that overview tab witch is the thing we want to see. you are missunderstanding what i'm trying to explain here.go back and read my first post 5 more times and you ""might' understand it.when you understands what i'm talking about here, then you can come back and discuss here. and no, saying 'it's a bad idea' isn't giving explanations. and the other thing is that you think it's a bad idea as you missunderstands the whole point of the topic and what we want to see fixed.now you are just trolling. want me to report you the 4th time?"
8/3/2014,"i'm not ""mad"" about anything. fact is that no trolling is occurring. i disagree with you, that's all. while you can report whenever you want, they'll frown upon you reporting people because they don't agree with you. now since you are taking this off topic by talking about reporting, i'm done discussing whether or not you think this is trolling.no, you are misunderstanding what i'm responding with. if a guy expect to see his war targets in his overview, because his corp leader has always ticked that box, then the times they don;t tick that box, or the times a corp decs them, the overview wont; have the behaviour that player expects. that's called inconsistent behaviour and it's not a good thing. i've explained this like a dozen times and you just come back and repeat your idea at me. i get it, i understand your idea, and i think it's a bad solution.i do understand, and i can discuss it whenever i want. you don't get to choose who is and isn't allowed to discuss it."
8/3/2014,"you are mad because i use the report function. you are mad because you think you can just trolls away here without getting consequences back. remember, this is not general discussion forum section incase you have forgotten that.nope, you fully missunderstands me, and it can't be said more clearer than that.if you think it's a bad idea, then explain why it is that?you think it's a bad idea as its forces standings upon war targets even if it's optional. but mate, it's up to the corp / alliance leaders if they want -10 standings towards the war targets or not. their members have to adapt to how the leaders want to run their corp or alliance. this options only applies to those who sends out war decs. those who gets the war decs will continue as normal as they will just see the normal eve-mail about getting war dec'ed. nothing changes that way. it only changes standings for those who sends out war decs. but like i said, it's up to the corp or alliance if they want to use those 2 options.so what was the problem with my proposal again?nope, i have explained in great details on why you don't understands the issues or what i'm trying to get fixed. it's in this topic. i'm not gonna bother to find it as it's easily available to find in this topic. use the search function if you are that lazy."
8/3/2014,"i'm well aware, which is why i'm discussing the merits (or lack thereof) of your idea, while you throw attack after attack at me.i left my quote in since that in itself is a reason it's a bad idea. you literally just quoted me explaining it then demanded an explanation.that is not at all what i stated. please go back and read it again. at no point did i call in to question the fact that it is optional.and i've explained in great detail why your idea would be bad for the game."
8/3/2014,"no you aren't discussing as you puts out your opinions on something you haven't understood yet. there is a difference from telling your opinions on something you understands and to saying your opinions when you haven't understood the issues. the last thing here is the case.again, you don't understands what i'm saying. peoples who doesn't changes anything on the overview will see the war targets like they appears now like normal. they willl be blinky red no matter what standings they have on those targets. the war dec system overrides all standings, therefor it doesn't matter for a new player that haven't modified anything with his overview settings that they will have the war targets as -10 as the corp decided to have them at that.or can you show some evidences that a war target for a new player will appear different with a -10 standing than how he will appear with just the war dec?no you can't as i know how this system works. there is no difference on how you see the targets from having -10 standing to be neutral once someone is a war target. that's why my idea is really good as it wont matter to anyone except that it fixes some issues with the war targets in the overview.you should be more educated in this before you spews out nonesense.look at my quote over on why you are wrong. i don't have to say more than that to figure out that you don't belong in this topic as you don't understand the whole case here.you claimed that my idea with the 2 options are forcing standings or whatever upon someone. this is not what my topic is about. it's about having the freedom to choose to use those 2 options for those who sees the needs to use it. where are the forcing here?and as i explained in my 2nd quote over, you don't understand the whole case here. so you are talking about something different than what i'm trying to get fixed or get into eve.where are those explanations?i can't find them."
8/3/2014,"right, so people in those corps, the members, will have their overviews set up and will expect to see their war targets. but in certain situations, their war targets won't show up (ceo forgets to tick box, defensive war dec), which is inconsistent behaviour. those people would now have targets shooting them that they can't see.i'm just going to go ahead and ignore the attacks that make up the rest of this paragraph.no, that is not at all what i stated. please go show me where in that post i stated anything about people being force into the option. you can't because that's not what i said at all."
8/3/2014,"no no no, again, you missunderstands. if you don't modify a single thing on the overview as a new player or whatever the war targets will still appear on the overview like normal. the differences is that the war targets here will appear in the same place as you see all other neutrals or those with no standings. this happens no matter if the war target have neutral standings or -10 standings. and this is what i have been trying to explain to you for ages. because of this, it doesn't matter for anyone that the war targets gets a -10 standing.there will be no changes this way as i have said a million times to now. once someone goes war target, the war dec system overrides the standings, so with my proposal, a new player will still see the war targets together with other neutrals in the overview (as long as they haven't changed anything on the overview) like it is by default.the proposal here will only apply to those who only want to sort out war targets in a seperate overview tab. those who decides to not do that will still see their war targets like normal.as i have given you an explanations on this case now over in my quote, it's pretty obvious that you didn't take my points.you should understand the war system and how the overview works before you speaks about something you don't know. i'm just sayin."
8/3/2014,"no, you misunderstand. if you do change you overview, you will expect to see war targets on it, but in certain situations, you won't see them. that is inconsistent.i'm not talking about new players, i'm not talking about people who never modify the overview, i'm talking about people that have not getting what they expect.well you keep explaining something i've not called into question. you keep re-explaining your point and ignoring what i've actually stated. so what do you expect?"
8/3/2014,"nope. either you use the default overview setup or you will just modify your own overview tabs. if you leave the default overview tab as default, nothing will change on how you see your war targets on the overview no matter what standing they have. that's the thing.if you modify your own war target overview tab, you are supposed to sort out war targets only in that tab. nothing except for the war targets will appear in that overview tab. if someone sets their overviews up so they don't see their war targets when they should, then they have set up the overview tab wrong. you can remove everything you want from showing up in your overview settings.you can add a seperate overview tab that only shows stations and poco's for example. so why shouldn't you be able to sort out your war targets to only show up in your war target overview tab then?this is what my proposal is all about.if they expect to see the war targets in a seperate overview tab, then they have to modify their own tab to be able to do that. they can't expect things to automaticly appear up better in an organised overview setup if they don't have to change settings in the overview.i have explained everything on what happens right now if you tries to sort out war targets only in a seperate overview tab. it get's messy. i have also explained that you have to be able to choose those 2 new options i have proposed if you are going to be able to sort out your war targets only in a seperate overview tab.this only applies to those who want to have that. this doesn't changes anything for those who sends out wars as the war targets will either appear as normal with this idea, but they will also appear correctly for those who want to have a seperate overview tab for war targets only."
8/3/2014,"right, so there yo uare, with your wt overview all set up right? so you can see all your wts. now what happens is someone decs on you, or your ceo forgets to tick the box? what doesn't show up in your wt overview under your idea? oh that's right, wts. all of a sudden, invisible people can shoot you.it's not hard to understand why this behaviour is inconsistent, so i don;t know why you seem to be struggling.no, you haven't. because you don't understand what i'm saying and so you keep just repeating yourself.mate, it's a bad idea. this has been explained at length. you don't get it because you actively refuse to look at anything from any point of view but your own."
8/3/2014,"still no, because the war target will just appear on the normal / default overview tab you have with all other neutrals then. so no war targets will be hidden bro.like me now, i have the normal overview tab as you can see here:"
8/3/2014,"but you won;t be looking at your normal overview, you'll be looking at your wt overview and expecting to see wts. what is the point is having a wt overview if all you are going to do is look at your normal overview anyway?at the end of the day, your idea would result in a wt overview that people use to look at wts, sometimes not having some of the wts on it. that is worse than it is now, by a huge margin.sigh... i've explained the reasons to you why this is a bad change. you still seem to just repeat yourself over and over claiming that i don't understand. when will you get it that i do understand. i'm not sitting here blindly staring at my screen screaming ""how do overviews work?!?!?!"" i'm simply pointing out the glaring flaws in your idea.honestly, i've had quite enough of repeating myself just for you to attack me and tell me i don't understand. so until either someone else posts or you learn to grow up and accept that you are not the oracle of eve, i'm done with this thread for now, since we'll get nowhere. no csm would take someone like you seriously acting the way you do though, so you might want to review your behaviour."
8/3/2014,"if you are supposed to see your war targets in the 'war target' overview, i have told what the corps or alliances that gets war dec'ed can do to fix that. as most corps or alliances rarely sends out more war decs than 30 each months, it's a small case for everyone to manually adjust the -10 standings to each corps you are getting war dec'ed by as most corps or alliances usually don't have more than 20-30 war against them at thr same time at max.lets say we gets war dec'ed by your alliance. as it's the only war dec'ers who can set this -10 standing at the same time as the war decs gets sent out, we that gets war dec'ed can't choose to use that option. so we have to manually adjust our standings to -10 towards you to be able to see only the war targets in the war target overview. and as i said, as someone almost never gets war dec'ed from more than 20-30 corps / alliances at the same time, it's a small thing to fix this way.if you war dec, then you can choose those 2 options to automaticly set -10 standing, as you do see much more war decs getting sent from an alliance than you have war against you, it will just take 10-15 mins max to manually adjust the standings to -10 for those who are getting war dec'ed that doesn't have the ability to use those 2 options when you sends out a war dec. no, read what i wrote over in my quote. you are still wrong.oh, now when youare done with my topic again, will i see you in a new corp tomorrow ?"
8/3/2014,"no, in fact, you are wrong. and you are too self-centred to see it. luckily for me, people that matter can see it, so your inane ramblings and incredible rage posts won;t get taken seriously, so they won't screw up the overview with your dumb ideas..certainly not. just much like the earlier point in this thread when i left it for a bit, i see no point in wasting the csm members time with you repeating yourself. the whole thread is already a waste of their time, and i'd rather keep your walls of text to a minimum."
8/3/2014,"nope, you are wrong, because my proposal fixes the issues with war targets in overview. it also fixes the same issues by manually setting the corps / alliances you get war dec'ed by to -10 to take advantage of the proposed fix that makes you see the war targets in the correct overview tab you have configured.there is absolutely no problems with my proposal at all. it just makes it easier for peoples to be able to sort out their war targets only in a seperate overview tab if they want that. if they don't want to change on somethings on the overview, then they can't expect to see the war targets sorted out in a seperate overview tab either.so to sum it up.1. for war dec'ers, this will only fix the issues with sorting out war targets only in the right overview tab for those who want's it.2. for those who gets war dec'ed, they can still manually adjust their standings towards the war dec'ers to -10 as you rarely comes over that someone gets war dec'ed more than 20 times at most every weeks. so it's super easy to modify standings to 20 corps / alliances every weeks for those who gets war dec'ed over adjusting standings to over 200 corps or alliances each weeks as it is now for those who sends out war decs.3. those who doesn't bother to change anything will still see their war targets on the overview exactly the same way as they do for them now in the default overview tab.4. this change is for the most part meant for those who sends out war decs so they can more easily decide to put their war targets to -10 standing as it's a pain for alliances to manually adjust standings to over 200 corps / alliances that get's war dec'ed (like from us).5. as most corps or alliances almost never gets war dec'ed from more than 20 corps / alliances as the most, my proposal will rule out the need for war dec'ers to struggle with the standings just to be able to sort out war targets correctly in the overview while it still will be easy peasy for those who are war dec'ed to manually adjust standings towars those they gets war dec'ed by.those who gets war dec'ed now have to adjust their standings anyways to be able to sort out war targets in a seperate overview anyways now. so it wont be any more hassle for them with my proposal. it will only take away one thing for the war dec'ers that makes it a better experience to war dec someone and to get a better way of sorting out war targets in the overview.profit???"
8/3/2014,"those 2 quotes don't make sense together. how can there be ""no problems"" if you have to set things manually. your whole complaint now is that you have to set things manually, so you are fine with other people having to set things manually, as long as it's not you. selfish.so to sum it up.1. this is only a fix for marmite2. the existing workaround works for everyone else3. you are too lazy to use the existing workaround4. your idea would create inconsistent behaviour and cause issues in several circumstances.5. you could just have less wardecs instead.6. the amount of effort for this temporary fix is probably on par with a fix for the real behaviour.7. you are unable to take criticism on even a basic level, and so shouldn't be posting in this section of the forum.so no. bad idea.back later!"
8/3/2014,"nope, as you compares those who gets war dec'ed who have to manually set standings towards like 15-20 corps / alliances as most to fix the issue anyways, it wont change anything for those who gets war dec'ed as they have to do the same thing anyways today. and because comparing those who gets war dec'ed by like 15-20 others at max against someone that sends out over 200 wars every weeks doesn't belongs anywhere.for those who gets war dec'ed, nothing changes from how it is today. and for those who war decs, my proposal will only remove one issue where you have to put in -10 standings to 100-200+ corps / alliances you are war decing to be able to sort out the war targets in the overview.in the end, only one bottleneck gets removed while everything else stays the same as today.so you still don't understand the core issue here. that's pretty freaking insane considering i have been explaining every details to you on how this things works pages after pages.you can't be genious."
8/3/2014,as an indy pilot with little interest in pvp i find the whole wardec system very unbalanced. it gives pvp'ers the tools to play their style of game while completely stopping indy ppilots from playing at all. how is this in any way fair? does ccp only care about pvp'ers enjoying eve? to hell with the rest of us?so i don't join a corp and play solo and miss out on the community experience of eve so i can actually lpay the game. not a great solution in my view. i'm sure the smart folks at ccp could come up with a way so pvp'ers can enjoy the wardec system and still allow breathing space for indy pilots - for example a corp can only be at war with one corp at a time - not 25 like one of the corps currenty wardec'ing us. if a corp has been wardeced then there could be a 3 week cooling off period before anyone can wardec them again. this would 'spread the love' more evenly across the landscape and allow everyone to enjoy the game the way they like to play it. right now i feel i am forced to play the game the way ccp want me to play it and that contradicts all the noise they make about it being an open sandbox. with a wardec in place - my game is over until the war dec is over. unbalanced.
8/3/2014,"i think you misunderstand the term ""sandbox"". it does not mean that you will get to do whatever you want whenever you want. it means that you can try and do whatever you want. just like everyone else in the game.your greatest opposition to your attempts to succeed in the sandbox are other players also attempting to succeed.however, the fact that you make the active decision to stop playing because of the actions of other players is in no way ccp's fault, not is it their responsibility to ""fix"" this non-existent problem. the wardec system does have some issues, but you cowering in the corner is not one of them."
8/3/2014,"you miss the point 100%. i am wondering if you expect me to fight back with my awesome indy skills that i've trained? or just mine anyway and loose an orca every day? or abandon mining and go do something else (see point about being forced out of my game play). it seems an indy pilot can't raise any point without someone like you accusing us of being wimps? how about, i'm not interested in pvp? how about my toon is not skilled for pvp? how about 3 or 4 people cant defend against a fleet of pro pvp'ers no matter what they do?the issue here is an unbalanced system that favours the pvp pilots and you don't need to be a genius to see that's exactly what it is. stick to that facts and leave the shallow 'coward' comments to the preschool kids."
8/3/2014,"no... de'veldrin has it spot on. you are most certainly allowed to do what you want to do... but others are allowed to do what they want to do even if it runs counter to your goals. moreover... you are allowed to avoid it using the mechanics and your adversaries are allowed to pursue you. and you are allowed to hire mercs to defend you the same way they are allowed to get their own industrialists to supply them with ships and equipment.eve is a ""rat race."" there is no ""quiet corner"" for anyone. if there was one... then everyone with half a brain would use that to their advantage and set up supply chains that cannot be war decced."
8/3/2014,"your opinion is one sided, and thus you don't actually know what balance is.yep. if you can't be asked to defend yourself, or even bother to train combat skills, then you can stay in an npc corps with the rest of them."
8/3/2014,"you guys are missing the fundamental point - i understand and appreciate what you are saying and in part i agree with your views, however, the mechanics do favour the pvp'er and it would be very easy to make it less brutal on the indy corps. : your opinion is one sided, and thus you don't actually know what balance is.^ that's pretty pathetic and childish - don't waste my time. i expect all the anti indy sheep to start making a noise, i expect anyone who's income to be affected to make a noise - so be it. i've put the idea out there for people to chew over - have a great day folks."
8/3/2014,why hello there op.all you did now was make your corp an even bigger target with your one sided approach and whine. if a corp is unable to protect themselves it is not ccp's fault. there are many corps that can bite back and do. but you are effectively asking ccp to fix your inability to do something about it. incidentally this is one of the ways i make isk ingame. helping helpless corp on how they can make life difficult for aggressors. you only achieve and progress if your willing learn.all i will say now is... see you soon.
8/3/2014,"let me shine your ""balance"" complaint in a new light.you feel that as an industrialist you have little power to fight back against pvpers... this is the exact feeling many pvpers have when they buy new ships and equipment.pvpers must either learn how to perform some industry themselves (despite having lacking skills and knowledge), make friends with an industrialist who can make them stuff (in return for isk and/or protection), or just shut up and buy stuff at the prices that others set. as said before... you are allowed to play the way you like... but so is everyone else. and no one is guaranteed to get what they want. you are not guaranteed to be ""left alone"" any more than i am assured getting a killmail."
8/3/2014,"the problems with the wardeccing systems is not due to the amount of wardec a corp is limited to. the wardec has it's problems, but the fact that your little indy corp, being wardecced by a few asshats, (the asshats could include me, sometimes it's hard to keep track of the people i'm shooting at) is not an imbalance issue. combat in eve should never be completely limited. eve, and i'm sorry if you think otherwise, is a player versus player game. if you don't like that, then htfu or go play some other mmo. wardecs are a means to an end, if that end means padding killboard with stupid indy pilots who think it's okay to go afk mine, autopilot an indy ship to jita, say going through the udema pipeline, or using a bs to try and fight a character that is hilariously more skilled than him. is nothing, and i mean nothing but the pilots own fault. you die in a wardec because you do not have the skills to deal with it? hire a merc corp, forsaken asylum, sovereign infinity, marmite, break-a-wish, so on and so forth. then once you have your ally. move your silly little hulk, to where they camp the most. the majority of wardeccers will not cross paths with another wardeccing alliance. you say you don't have the ability to deal with someone like that? that is your own choice, you choose to invest time into getting a tech 2 mining barge, you made that choice, and now you must deal with the draw backs. you willfully remain ignorant of how combat works in eve, and you arrogantly splutter into the eve forums demanding for change because you think it should be different because of your own ignorance. i've seen plenty of indy corps fight back effectively. i've seen hundreds of pilots people deny kills for the aggression corp. here's a few tips, have a merc corp ready and able to ally into wars, have safespots, undock points, dock points, scout points, around your entire system. use alts to watch neighboring systems don't afk mine, don't autopilot, don't running around in a raven expecting to kill a thorax, more so if you an indy invested pilot who has little to no sp in pvp. learn how to pvp, it's a lot to know and you need to know it if you want to win. don't be an nitwit and post in an open forum where someone like kane, kane of all people will see you. or you can sit here, and splutter about how unfair it is, which will get you nowhere fast, and somewhere soon, that somewhere is buried with wardecs and probably a few wardeccers who are way too happy with mlp, and kane, and if kane is there, may god have mercy on your soul.#deletetheweak"
8/3/2014,"danger will robinson, danger will robinson!!"
8/3/2014,"while i don't agree with the op in that he seems to expect total safety to a degree, you do have to admit that wardeccers have it pretty easy. it's incredibly cheap to throw out wardecs like there's no tomorrow, and a lot of groups do so to the point that highsec becomes their safety version of nullsec, where they have loads of carebears to shoot but never need to worry about those pesky neutrals attacking them. then when they get overwhelmed they can dock anywhere they want. so imho, it does need to be made harder to build up large wardec lists than the way it is now. there needs to be more consequences to making that decision, and those consequences need to scale up as you enter into more wardecs. not to make it impossible but to make it a choice you have to be dedicated to and work for.to the op, i'd suggest you go and take a look at what people run wardecs for, and take a realistic and balanced look at it from both points of view and come back with a solid proposal for how it could be changed to make it more engaging for all sides."
8/4/2014,"my opinion.i don't worry about what or how others want to play their game.it is a game right?if they spend more time and money, then they have more. isn't that life too?all the power to them. and i move on with my game. it's just that simple.if i'm not having fun playing a game. whats the point."
8/4/2014,"exactly.but there's people complaining what all ruins the game in their perspective, as everyone ""should be on equal footing"".if you want everyone on equal footing, go complain how the t2 bpo's are no longer obtainable and how people who have them are making a fortune with little to no effort."
8/4/2014,"i love that this argument is still going on.listen up guys: isboxer is here to stay. even if the csm championed this idea, there's no way in hell ccp are going to go forward with a ban of isboxer. aside from the enormous amount of effort it would be to tell if people are using it, the loss of accounts that would result from the banning of isboxer would be staggering. we're talking thousands of accounts here, not a handful of disgruntled players.if ccp wanted to ban isboxer they would have had to do it right at the beginning. as they haven't, and people have built whole isboxer armies, it would be too devastating to ccps income to go back and remove it now.at the end of the day you just have to live with the fact that it exists, accept that it affects most players pretty much to the sum of zero, and move on."
8/4/2014,isboxer makes money for ccp. more accounts simply put. this is poor idea.
8/4/2014,come on guys. having people read isn't enough. get them to add their opinions and other comments.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
8/4/2014,+1 on this. i agree. however i am curious for the cost on one of these ships. as there are mechanics in game to go around this already from courier contracts.

8/4/2014,"if you're actively playing the game you're not going to need this because you can see it's full. if you're not actively playing you have bigger problems, like the fact that you're begging to be asploded because you're not paying attention."
8/4/2014,lost it. was thinking the same thing.
8/4/2014,"if you are fitting a ship to do exploration and also want to pvp, then just fit it for pvp, replace the scram with your chosen exploration modules an huzzah, you are ready to go. sure, they will be able to warp away, but then that's the price you pay for also being able to pve with the same build.and exploration is new player friendly. exploration while dual fit to run competent pvp is not so new player friendly."
8/4/2014,"a scram or point/web does more in a fight than just ensuring the other party does not warp away. for most frigate fights, range dictation is critical. giving up range dictation means the chances of a win are extremely low, and as you said, even if things do still go your way, the enemy can just warp off. so you have little to no chances of winning the dps race, and even if you do, you won't get the kill. that is nothing to huzzah about in my book. extra modules that gimp your ship's pvp ability are not required for fw site farming. and fw is the most successful mix of pvp and pve in the game. why should they be required for exploration? ccp should do away with pvp-useless mids and fold them into either the ship hull attributes or into pvp mids. for some reason this game feels we should offer ourselves up as hobbled sheep if we want to explore outside of high sec."
8/4/2014,"because exploration isn't pvp. why can't fleets of exhumers strip mine the hull off of aggressors? in this game you have to make choices when you fit your ship. if you want something fully competent in pvp, then do pvp. if you want to do pve as well, then you have to accept that you have to make decisions that will reduce your pvp effectiveness. it doesn't mean you wont win any fight if you need to, but it means you won't be able to leap into any battle with the same level of readiness.choice is a good thing to have, and we shouldn't take that away by creating more ways for people to do everything at once.edit: and 1 module off the mids isn't making you ""hobbled sheep"". it makes you less effective, sure, but it certainly doesn't make you defenseless."
8/4/2014,"so i thought that this would have come up already since the kronos release, but the last thread i could find was from 2012 (reference: old thread)it would be nice to be able to toggle between preset/saved broadcast settings vs doing them on the fly in the middle of a fight. this mainly applies to hot swapping logistics and dps ships and implementation could range from drop downs to toggle buttons, whatever is easier. this isn't a big request afaik but would be a nice tweak to the changes from kronos."
8/4/2014,i always forget to check the settings are correct until the moment before the fight :s
8/4/2014,yup and then you're stuck following overview if you're set wrong
8/4/2014,i agree. however the some of the drones need an overhaul on their speed. for example web light drones go so slow. a bit hard for a webbing drone to keep with a nano cruiser or a frigate.
8/4/2014,thread closed due to heavy off topic posting and attacks.
8/5/2014,"another bump, as the sov thread in f and i is still going strong. thanks for the read"
8/5/2014,"i disagree wholeheartedly. exploration in low sec and null sec is pvp because jumping a ship into low or null is pvp. even if your only goal is to avoid getting shot down by other players it's still pvp. technically, just undocking in high sec is pvp as well. you can have a large mining op with multiple ships, which implies multiple pilots, which means some of those players could be tasked with security. however, exploration is a solo activity. bringing 2 ships in and splitting the (already minimal) loot between two pilots would be unrealistic. does anyone do this? requiring a pirate frig at an absolute minimum to protect yourself from even a single pvp-fit t1 frigate is exclusionary, and screws with the isk/reward ratio. right now, newer players wishing to venture into low or null for exploration face two choices: 1) fly more than they can afford to lose or; 2) bring a ship that literally any properly fit solo t1 frigate should be able to trounce. if ccp wants new players to have fun and go exploring in low/null then they shouldn't require them to gimp their frigate before heading into ""dangerous territory."" isn't that exactly when you want to arm up? instead, they strip down, and put on a module that serves no purpose toward a ship's defensive or offensive capabilities. isn't it enough of a disadvantage to have them distracted by the hacking mini-game and having to haul a probe scanner? do we really need to strip them of 1, 2, or even 3 mid-slots (data analyzer, relic analyzer, cargo scanner) on top of that as the price of admission for engaging in exploration?"
8/5/2014,"basically, what you want to do is have two advantages on the ship for no disadvantage.you want to be viable in pvp.you want to be able to do exploration sites.seriously? dude, give it a rest. you want to do exploration sites as an alternative money source? fine, that means you'll gimp your pvp fit as opposed to people having un-gimped fits which doesn't allow them to earn isk via exploration."
8/5/2014,o look this thread again.
8/5/2014,"your idea is terrible. it's so simple to just create a corp with just your own characters in it. hell i did that for a while when i started playing this game. ccp cannot possibly monitor this. regardless of what happens with multiboxing software (which will be nothing because this debate has been going for years, and nothing ever happens), there is no way for them to actually monitor and enforce something like this.just move on from the fact that multiboxers exist. it's not that a big a deal really. if your system's belts are getting chewed up by a multiboxer, move on to another system. gank them. do anything except whine about it."
8/5/2014,"give it a rest already. stop with these sensless threads about multiboxing. it's a big universe, nobody is forcing you to stay in ammamake all your life."
8/6/2014,"the problem i have with mulitboxing and isboxer it gives players an advantage, and that advantage is clear when we think of how they are using the accounts.a few things are taken for granted when we are talking about gaining an advantage: (many senarios can be concocted to legitimize the use of this type of gameplay i suppose)all isk or ores from any character that is not the main account is sent to the main account and assets across all accounts are assumed property of the main account. i.e. this is not someone roleplaying with 2+ accounts and treating them seperatly.isk generated is used to make the life of one highly skilled pilot, known as the main, much easier than the game was intended to be and much easier than anyone not using isboxer.did you know a 10 char multiboxer can afford to lose a 2bn isk carrier ever 6 hours of mining at only 35m per hour.this didn't have to be done i created a spreadsheet just to show how one human can take advantage of eve's economy by multiboxing. ive set it up so you can see how much advantage they can get per character up to 10.screenshot of spreadsheetif you want to play with the numbers to see how much you can make with other factors u can get the spreadsheet heregoogledrive spreadsheeti like how 1 guy mining at a moderate rate at only 4 hours a day can net over 30bn isk each month. i think im gonna give this multiboxing a try"
8/6/2014,your spreadsheet is awful for many reasons. the primary being you're not going to make a solid 35 mill an hour across all characters for 6 hours straight in highsec (not even ice miners pull in 35m an hour solid). if you're not in highsec then there's a lot more things you could be doing to make better isk per hour on one character. last time i played in whs and such i was approaching 500m an hour with two accounts. are you going to demand that whs and null be nerfed now?you should give multiboxing a try. you'll quickly find out your theoretical income is absolutely ridiculously overly optimistic..make sure to say hi to the gankers when they come.
8/6/2014,"i am not demanding anything be changed as i like the game as it is.here is some crappy highsec income for ya.nuf saidi don't need to try it as i know people that use it and 35m/hr came from them and is a standard 0.0 anomoly mining income for a t2 mackinaw pilot with fleet boosts using t1 strippers. about 1600m3 per 88 seconds.as far as wh, i dont know about that and yes there is many other things you can do to make more isk per hour.i know ratting can net u 90m a hour easy in a carrier and military 5 index with only 1 char.as to my spreadsheet being crappy. haha yea prob a bit yea, i didn't go to spreadsheet design school so sry for that.ganking yes thats a real threat but is easily paief for with just another hour of mining each day.we can assume if your putting enough effort to multibox eve you can be most likely expected to be putting in more than 1 or 2 hours a day doing ""your thing""."
8/6/2014,"there is nothing scientific or factual with that spreadsheet screenshot. you might as well put in random numbers.you're running fleet boosters yet you neglect to include them in your account total. you present this as an easy possible income rate for all yet you're using numbers from a nullsec anom. you're not accounting for the rent or other costs of keeping said nullsec anomaly either. you're like the industry type that doesn't take into account the worth of the minerals they used because they mined them ""for free"". meanwhile in highsec your numbers are wildly better then the average miner could ever hope for and you will find gankers in in most systems with good ice or ore. granted most of the gankers do tend to rotate across several systems so it's possible to avoid them if you move enough.edit : i just wanted to get it clarified that your numbers are bad."
8/6/2014,"it is very simple to trace commands from one ip over several accounts and compare the timestamps for that commands on the server. the argument about the lost accounts was also made years back when ccp ignored boting more or less and ignored tons of petitions that i and others did about a 0.3 system called ingunn with like 200 l4 distribution mission bots in it(yes we did petition them, we killed them for hours, we made vids about them, we seen ccp staff in polarises around taking a look on the system and it took over a year to swing the ban hammer). plex prices went down big time after it and the player count did stabilize and grow back to the old value over time after the big ban.ccp always will try to allow something that gives more revenue till a point where it becomes a problem or better put more and more people become aware of it and notice it as a problem. it was one thing having a couple of bots in the drone region farming in ravens where 1-2 people pass by during the day, it is a different one having 200 in front of you every day, it is a different thing if there where some people using it in whs compared to having often more is boxed vg fleets in high sec incs than real player fleets right in front of you. it is again a difference between a couple of hulks mining somewhere in a 0.0 dead end and seeing like 50 skiffs at a gate or station in high sec, all with the same name + a number. same goes for pvp applications, where is boxed bomber or gank fleets become more and more common instead of being the exception.in the end, there will be one day when ccp will disallow the usage, people will sell off a couple of chars and everybody will look back a few months later at the game and agree that it was a change for the better and ccp should have probably taken the step rather sooner than later. same as with the bots, at one point you will rather lose a limb than damage your game further and it is not that every single account is lost forever, most people will simply downsize a bit and others will reactivate a few old accounts with the lower plex price so the drop will be a lot less heavy as you think, similar to how it was back then with the bot banning."
8/6/2014,"i just want to clarify your complete argument is bad.my numbers are easily achieveable with a small time of training. your idea and re-refferenceing that highsec is such low income doesnt really matter much as the people not making that type of income prob arent multiboxing. you seem to be a very uninformed player and/or just a time wasting troll. you say ""you're running fleet boosters yet you neglect to include them in your account total."" are you talking about heavy water usage? why include such small expenses? u can run 8 hours a day easy for only a few hundred million a month.i do not count the cost of the toilet paper i'll use in a few hours into the meal i'm eating now.with all your question/comments only leading away from the obvious point that really can only be argued with nonsense, ill let you ""insert your awful comments below""."
8/6/2014,"otlichnick wrote:did you know a 10 char multiboxer can afford to lose a 2bn isk carrier ever 6 hours of mining at only 35m per hour.this is the flaw that invalidates all that work you put into your argument, and every other anti-isboxer argument i've seen.eula states that there shall be no advantage given to any account. nowhere does it say anything about advantages given to players. until you can differentiate between the two, you won't be able to form a valid argument.on a side note, i recently tried isboxer to manage two of my accounts and found the setup time each time i used it and the issues i have with desyncing actually caused my income to drop, so i stopped using it. the slow, plodding method i had to use was far slower."
8/6/2014,"some issues:-when you're running your accounts in their own virtual environment its a small step to have each use a different proxy. isboxer users already pay for their tool, so it's likely they'd be willing to put the additional money for dedicated proxy slots on the table.-large number of people using the same proxy would result in large comparison overhead, opening the door for all kind of node killing shenanigans...-online games will rarely process all commands on the server side but rather will compute the effect client sided and send the results of the commands to the server. the server will then perform a sanity/consistency check. this is why stuff like speed hacks etc. exists; the client sends updated positions that are wrong but set up in a way that fools the sanity check on the server. i'm not familiar with the details of eve i/o, however to just assume that the client sends something along the lines of ""player pushed button x at time y"" seems unlikely.so no, it's not simple."

8/7/2014,"simple in theory hard in reality. setting up the system to track every single button press and compare every single button press on every single account in existence would suck up so much server power that every system would be in tidi constantly. even if you limited those comparisons to just accounts with matching ips you'd still have massive overhead from isps with nas setups, apartments, condos, dorms, schools, etcetcetc..plex prices never dropped big time after a banning ever. just a quick look at the history of plex prices confirms my statement. small time of training? you're saying getting into perfect mackinaws with perfect refining skills while being able to setup a pos, have a rorqual, have a jump freighter and rent a nullsec block is a ""small time of training"".. you say my argument is bad but your numbers are awful. you're ignoring the usage of booster characters. you're ignoring time spent moving product to market (including the character training time required). you're ignoring rent costs. you're ignoring all kinds of time and isk sinks involved with getting the income in your spreadsheet.i'm talking about training time for characters. costs of ships costs of structures and the costs of running the boost. you're all like but brah you can get a carrier in like 6 hours with 5 characters!!!! while ignoring the booster alt(s) and the other stuff going on.this highlights your lack of seriousness more then any other statement here. rent costs are not toilet paper. jump freighter costs are not toilet paper. pos costs are not toilet paper. booster/jf account costs are not toilet paper. i can keep going but if you haven't gotten the point by now then there's really no hope in you seeing why your numbers are awful."

8/7/2014,"well, thats the point and this is actual contest between hunter and its pray. if pray stays vigilant and see a warning sign in time, than she will be ok. thats still implies you will have to press dscan all the time, while cloacker still can safely stay in passive afk mode indefinetly. that means pressing dscan, like, for hours, in any system you will see someone in local, but not in dscan. this thing is tedious, i mean, sometimes you will be distracted, sometimes you will just forget. thus cloaker will preserve his role of hunter waiting for careless enough victim. and you still can disrupt your enemy's activities, like, demonstratively going into active mode conveying to all who cares that the system is now under your and your friends' control. so they will either will have to look for cover, or will gather some meeting party and cloakers will get some content, which - as it's usually claimed - they are actually after.you probably missed this piece - according to this idea, dscan never will tell you direction or distance to cloaking ship, there will only be some additional indicator which will light up when there is cloacking vessel in active mode in d-scan range. usual techniques, like narrow-beaming, won't work in this case. it will be pretty hard to triangulate it without those in most cases.but in case if you stay at one place in active mode - yes, you will be scanned down. but if you'll be switching spots on regular basis, you'll be mostly safe even while staying in active mode - thats actually what i intended to achive. if cloacker want to really threaten his victims and disrupt all operations in the system, he have to be atk, in active cloaking mode, switching spots to evade cloak-busting scanning equipment.so both these main applications of afk cloaking - disruption of operations and hunting - will still work quite well, but now they require active participation from cloacker to work as intended, and they allow those victims who are vigilant enough to evade being caught - which actually leads to more content for hunters as numbers of those who will just go out and try their best will increase. because, as today, if you don't have big guys backing you up atm (or at all) with their jump drives fired up, and you see some familiar face in local whom you know as 100% cloaked hotdropper, you just safe up and wait, or jc somewhere else. so, no content for hunters, and distruption of operations of any entity smaller than you with no actual effort for other party.edited: but it will be even more intresting contest if ""hunter"" could get some method of checking is his ""pray"" diligently scans her surrounding, or not. like some kind of radar system which registers any dscan attempts in dscan range (dscan probably implies active radar system, so it should radiate some energy that can be registered by other party, lore-wise). so you can wait for some oblivious victim in passive mode, just checking this ""d-scan meter"", or you can study her ""d-scan pressing patterns"" and find some holes in them, in which you could switch to active mode and get her.this new feature could be made available only to ""inherently cloaking"" vessels (and mb even only when they are actually cloacked), like covops, recons etc. so hunter can register each victim's dscan attempt, but victim - can't."
8/7/2014,"actually, i am quite good with this, and i understand perfectly well what you explained in context.the additional burden by needing to d-scan for protective reasons is exactly the kind of effort we are currently missing.i believe both sides need more risk. i never meant to imply this idea could not be capable of meeting the need.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

8/8/2014,"i think i'll try to post it in these forums too.ui for setting pi infrastructure needs some attention desperately. this clickfest is mindnumbing. four little things would greatly ease life of production planets' owners (i'm shure someone already has mentioned all those, but can't remember where i saw it and who did it):1) stop binding routes to specific type of product, manufactured at some factory. let it be just generic route, going from this factory to some storage - so if you change the product next month for some other, it would start to use routing scheme already in place. currently we have to go to each factory and set all routes anew every time we decide to go for some other product.2) add ability to set a common routes' destination for products created in several factories. like, you select several factories, then press some hotkey, then select storage - and all the products from all selected factories now are routed to this storage. again, atm we have to click each factory, then click some buttons, than click storage - 16 times per planet.3) add ability to set production scheme in batch. like in previous one, you select several factories, press hotkey, select a scheme from dropdown - and all these factories seeded with this scheme now. again, clickfest atm.4) ability to set up routes from some storage to input lines on factories in batch is also in dire need. but this one is somewhat more tricky, as, unlike in case of routing the single output product from factories, we have 1 to 3 input lines on them. i see the most straightforward way to implement it as that: first, you select several identical factories at once; upon doing this, new control panel appearing, it has three buttons: ""route output product to one destination"", ""set production schematics"" and ""route input product(s) to selected factories""; you click batch-set production schematics button, dropdown list appears and you sellect some production scheme; then you click ""route input product(s) to selected factories"" button, select source storage facility and select some material which is stored, or being routed here - and ui creates routes to all selected factories, that has schematics that need this material; then you are using ""route output product to one destination"" button to finish the setup process.by implementing it this way, switching to generic route approach, as proposed in 1), may become not necessary, as reestablishing routes will become much easier. but still, would be nice to have it too.of course, previous ""one facility at a time"" way of setting scheems up should be preserved too."

8/9/2014,"keep the support/questions/comments/suggestions coming! it is clear that we have the attention of the csm, so let's get more of the community's eyes on this and get ccp to know we as the players want and need this!!i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
8/9/2014,"the problem is that afk cloacker in most cases is an atacker, and other side plays the role of helpless victim, a harmless pray, in most of the cases - this actualy why most cloakers are here, and not in the, say, goon or nc. space - they need easy kills, devoid of risks. so there is no such thing as ""afk cloaker risk"" or ""defense of victim"". when victim sits at outpost/pos she isn't ""has taken defensive position"", she already lost battlefield for cloaker without him contributing any efforts.simply because of cloaker's presence any ratting activities start to not worth time spent on them. you could go do some missions, but you can be easly caught on gate as you don't have a slightest hint is cloaker active or not, and with current mechanics he can attack anytime, almost instantly. and even if you have reached mission site in one piece, you can't guarantee you will finish it untill combat probes will apear. and after you've seen them even once and managed to warp out, you have to drop this mission immidiately, it isn't safe anymore to return here - because if hunter managed to scan it down, you won't see any warning signs next time you will try to return here and continue, and will be caught. and that also means that you have to stop running missions for an hour, at least, to bore him off your tail. or call it a day. or jc to hs to run incursions (most probable outcome) - you have your operations effectively disrupted, even if cloaker went to bed soon after that, you either already far away from here, or you just don't want to bother and try anymore, as you feed up of this games and spending your times for nothing without any gain, while losing your standings with agents. so again, the problem of hunter having all the initiative on his side.with combat sites it even worse - those can be easly scanned beforehand, so you just won't even try if local shows familiar face. in best case you will be allowed to spend some time to clear most of the rats and then they will overtake site from you. this is so at least for smaller entities, which don't have developed logistics and srp to ease their losses. loss of ratting ships for them is a big deal and often means hours and days of waiting for another one, efforts spent on buying and assembling all the parts by players themselves etc. and they don't have any counter-hot drop defense parties ready to save them anytime and to create any risks for cloaked hot-droppers. thats why my idea from before adds this new pre-atacking stage when cloaker must transfer from passive to active state, to at least issue some warning signs to its pray. if i knew that i can at least do something to protect myself after my mission complex was compromised, or while running [probably prescanned] combat site, i could actually try to accept the challenge and risk my ship - because in this case i at least have some chance of winning. without that i won't even try and jc to empire to run incursions. which takes us to current situation in nulls.the problem is not that some people can't tolerate some risk - they can - the problem is that only a few want to participate in ""fights"" they have no chance to win at all (and by ""fights"" here i imply not actual fight between cloaker + his friends against ratting pray - which will end bad for pray almost always - but contest when pray tries to stay vigilant and aware and hunter tries to find a loophole in her awarness). they don't want to spend hours and hours on reassembling and delivering new ships and for additional ratting to cover their losses, just to deliver some easy ""fast-food"" ""content"" for other party."
8/9/2014,"this is a game.drop the mockery of logic being represented by a misplaced survival instinct, and think like someone playing a game who actually has nothing to lose by taking a risk.do you feel the game has too much penalty or risk?don't blame just one side. for both sides to have tactics available that allow both to frequently survive, balance exists.boring, yes. unresolved, yes.noone said balance made for fun play, in the absence of resolving playing a game. it just shows a problem with the design.the pve ship needs to be able to not just fight against it's cloaked opponent, it needs to be confidant the cloaked opponent can't be a cyno equipped wtf-wildcard with a fleet inside of it.as a miner in null, one of the most aggravating things i ever faced was needing to dock up, or go into a pos, because the expectation that a cyno would make a good fight into a joke / gank was simply too high to ignore.if my mining ship was equal in combat ability to the typical cloaked ship, and i knew no ganking hot-drop would happen, the problem to me would not exist.i would actually look forward to seeing a hostile show up. in case anyone missed it, grinding roids get's a bit dull after a while. a nice shoot-em-up would be a great change of pace for a few exciting minutes.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/9/2014,"you missed the most important point while quoting yes, this is a game, but i repeat again: most people just don't percieve a game in which you have zero change of winnig (like in a typical situations happen under rules of current mechanics i've descried in my previous post) as fun enough to play, they just don't want to waste their time. because a time is a very limited resource - the most limited resource, i would say. and this is especially so for eve with its older-than-average playerbase. if i know for shure that i can't protect my ship in any way possible against this one 100% cloaked hotdropper staying in my local for days aside from stop playing at all, why shoud i even spend my precious time trying to do anything? what will i achieve? i will be granted, all expenses accounted for, with the same income i could get running lv4 in highs, but i will have to spend much, much more time on most boring things eve can offer - logistics and mindnumbing clickfest implied by buying and assembling new ships. moreover, as i need isks for any my activities in eve, i need to earn them somehow. and i can't do it reliably in nulls because of afk cloakers have upper hand in our contest, forcing me to spent more and more time on recovering from these losses, both spent on logistics and earning additional isks, forcing me to effectively run in circles while filling someone's kb, so i again have to switch back to do it in empire space, or just to drop from game for some time (i don't count plex buying as source of ingame income, sorry) as i could do many other fun things either in different regions of space, or in other games, or irl, and i will.you have fun in the game when you compete and overcome some difficulties, when results somehow depend on you wise/unwise decisions. you have almost zero fun if you just being smashed every time you try to do something, unable to do anything about it. so it isn't important was your decisions correct or not, you just lose your ship and penalized with additional time you need to spend to recover. so only reasonable and wise decision you can make is stop playing, in the end. or go play somewhere else.i repeat, i saying all these from a point of view of solo player or member of small entity, as i don't like to be part of bigger ones. those entities in most cases (because of small numbers and thefore bad tz coverage, lack of their own hotdropping forces, low level of combat preparness etc) expose zero threat for even lamest cloaked hotdroppers. and those hotdroppers perfectly aware about it, thats why they chose to hotdrop them in the first place. i only writing all these as power projection and need to find a place and means for small entities to survive in null became a hot topic recently, so i though this could be useful input, as afk cloaking is an issue of power projection too.in most cases pve ship can't fight with hotdroppers. if hotdropers will think it can, they will get more people to enshure it now won't. and knowing that it's cyno equiped won't help you in cases i described - if there will appear a way to check for this, most of them will become cyno eqiped - it needs a couple of weeks to aqure all the skills needed, one month alt can be trained to be cloaked cyno-dropper. the battle between cloaker with a powerfull support and member of small entity happens before any shots fired. when shots fired it's almost always over already, for ""prey"" party. thats why additional safeguards, threat indicators and tools for both parties are needed, which will allow them to compete with roughly similar chances, thus adding some sort of additional gameplay layer which takes place before cloaker will even uncloaks. the cases you are describing implies that risk comes with uncertainty wether or not some cloaker is a hotdroper. what i'm talking about is about cases when big enough entity (or player(s) with a lot of alts) can disrupt opertations in vast region of space by doing effectively nothing 90% of the time. you know for shure they are hotdroppers, and you know there is zero chance you will evade them if they want to go after you. so you stop any attempts as you don't want to engage in ""thrilling"" parts of eve's gameplay involving recovery from losses, without any option, all the time."
8/9/2014,"the disadvantages of engaging in exploration include being required to fit a probe launcher, data analyzer, relic analyzer, and cargo scanner. this proposal would free up 2 mids out of the 3 mids and 1 high currently required. so it hardly removes all disadvantages from exploration in terms of slot usage. if you want to do it in low or null, then it is also relevant that you are required to be unaligned, in a hostile pvp zone while engaging in a mini-game. ghost sites are a good step toward reducing the overhead of modules required by allowing data or relic analyzers. my proposal simply goes one step further and lets explorers keep an effective pvp fit while exploring in ""dangerous space"".i have to wonder if those arguing against it are really just afraid of seeing their supply of kb padding ****fit explorers armed with a point."

8/9/2014,"problem: whenever you group your weapons, the icon seems to move to a random open spot. solution: design it so that when you group a weapon, the grouped icon is displayed in the first available spot."
8/9/2014,"ya know, when your ideas are shot down on f&i, it's a violation of the forum rules to post it here too."
8/10/2014,"as a college student, i have a simple solution for you all, or for the ones that are complaining about this. in college, or at least in american colleges, i don't know about other world colleges, but if a student wants to get something in the college or in the community changed, they have to write a research paper. this research paper can be any length, though longer and more compelling it is, the more likely it will get considered. anyways, moving on, here is what i suggest. if you feel that this program. isboxer is such a bad problem, why don't you collect data on it? write a research paper with a compelling argument along with supporting data and facts, and submit it to ccp, and cms. the worst that can be told to you is the same thing that is already happening in this thread, and that is they don't agree with your argument.instead of fighting on the forums, and making the thread more and more unlikely to be read, why don't you try my suggestion out?"
8/10/2014,"these key statements i made already answers your response.to clarify:the point is that the pve ship be made fully capable of an encounter, where it could expect a reasonable chance of fighting off a cloaked hostile.this means the pve pilots have an option for practical mining / ratting, in a fit that also is competent to fight against a cloaking ship.two other things also need to happen here:1. gatecamps filter out pure 'front-line' pvp ships from being able to penetrate pve space, by sheer blocking or intel channel warning. this already happens, in many cases, and simply needs to be maintained.2. hot dropping vanishes as a threat potential. noone is going to risk a fight against a possible fleet by cyno.to solve this, i suggest a spool up delay of 30 to 60 seconds, where the cyno ship is locked down, but no beacon appears except on grid to it until the spool up completes, so the systemwide beacon appears at the same time ships can travel to it.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/10/2014,"well, concerning my idea, i took for granted that dropping mechanichs will stay as they are, so tried to find a way for a ""prey"" to avoid it before it even happens and before cloaked ""hunter"" will be given chance to lock and point her - if she plays proactively and stays aware of surroundings.your approach will work too, shurely. if hotdrops will get nerfed, i mean.but there are a couple of problems. first, what do you mean by ""spool up"" and ""locked down""? will the cynoing ship be totally harmless during this spool up? will it be able lock and point, use propulsion? if it will, than how this spoolup will help if you are caught by tanked force recon vessel while flying typical ratting ship (hac/bc/bs/t3)? he will simply point you for a minute, than droppers will finish you. second, it could be easly circumvented by an alt. like, you first send cloacking tackler to your victim. when it gets into position, ready to uncloack and point, you either fly another character in the system, or use prepositioned one, and initiate covert cyno. the moment beacon appears or local starts spiking, tackler locks victim and she is doomed now. this approach won't help small entities to evade oppression of large ones in situations i described."
8/10/2014,"can i provide an opinion. isn't cloaking in someone's system the reward for making it there? i mean... i'm a noob, but from what i gather.... from gatecamps, interdictors, bubbles, legitimate anti-cloaking tactics, and the fact that if you are locked, you can't cloak, and cuppled along with that problem, with insta-lockers and you can't cloak right away when you break gate cloak.... i would think that making it to someone system out in the back arse no where a great reward! the ability to sit there.... or maybe it just a consequence for those that are unable or simply to lazy to proactively protect their systems?"
8/10/2014,"this misconception already is many years old.no, it isn't. nulls actually floodded with a 2 weeks old noobs doing relic sites. to get in particular region is somewhat tricker, but no, it's not even close to hard. assuming that any real hot dropper will fly at least covops, he won't be stopped even by most tightly camped gates, if determined enough - update your clone, buy another ship, retry. but such tightly camped gates quite rare and easly visible on map statistics, so you will just find a detour. or you will simply jump into couple wh, until you will come out <20 jmps from your destination, than fly through mostly empty sov space. if you choose time right, like at day hours, or near the dt, nothing will stop you.and in case of big entities, this is all you need. when you have one alt with covop cyno here, you can flood it with others anytime you want. so, logistics and getting their deceased (if any) members back to positions is a piece of cake for them, generally.and, if you would have read discussion actually, you saw that npc nulls were mentioned, and from perspecive of smaller entities. you hardly can control npc nulls, do you? especially if you are member of some small entity here. you could only evade big threats, but in current mechanics you can't do it at all, aside from stay docked/at the pos, i.e. afk cloacking hotdropper will disrupt your operations with no effort 90% of the time. simply because you have no means to be warned about something cloacked already near you and ready to tackle, and when it uncloaked and locked you, it's already too late to do anything, and droppers start to fall from the sky. as you are member of small entity you can't have a rescue party all the time ready to save you nearby, you also don't have any dropping factilities. that constitutes the problem, and similar problems drive the sov space to its current stagnation, on a bigger picture.thats why afk cloaking is a part of power projection problem and should be dealt with if ccp want to give smaller entities some place to live in nulls without joinging blue donat."
8/10/2014,"i honestly don't understand where you are going with this, 2 week old alts doing relic sites? what does this have to do with cloaking? wormholes? i'm pretty sure their wormhole spawn is a bit spastic, and shouldn't be used as a way to get into someone else's sov. that being said, if you have a large corp, i guess you can break holes until you get to the place you want. something that you see they are changing if you read some of the threads in the suggestions areas...big entities? so they hold a lot of sov space? so shouldn't that have the people to protect the gates of that sov space? if you can't protect it, then maybe you shouldn't own it? or maybe they own it because of the problem of power projection, which has nothing to do with cloaking at all, which breaks your argument that cloaking is part of the power projection problem. which doesn't seem right that cloaking should receive the blame for power projection, power projection seems like a problem with cynos, so maybe you should take your beef with cynos instead of attacking a symptom instead of the cause.... if you are a smaller entity then maybe you shouldn't hold sov space till you are ready to beable to defend what you hold, even if cloaking couldn't bring in hotdrops, what stopping someone from building a wtf speed fit and just fly so fast that by the time you scan them, they are off grid when you get there? what stopping them from power projecting right on to your front door and kicking it in?you have so many flaws in your logic that is really laughable to be honest."
8/10/2014,"well, you have only one - you try to post opinnions without even caring to study the topic you are postin in. or mb have a problem with comprehending a writen text. or just don't even intend to and came here for trolling. you choose. it shows how laughable such ""arguments"" are, and always were. it takes close to zero efforts to get to any part of null space in covops if you can use map and mwd+cloack trick, period. i don't count spending 30-60 minutes jumping gates and burning out of bubles as effort significant enough. wormhole is a universal way to nullsecs these days. all those newbie scanners use them without second thought. you find any leading to nulls, than you just traverse semi-empty systems without any hindrances untill you get to your destination. you either don't know the game you are playing, or deliberately pretend you don't know a thing."
8/10/2014,"you are pretending to be clueless again. no one can create a 24/7 working firewall on every gate in their sov space it's a game, no one will care to such extent, it's reality. and single alt with covops cyno will bring in another 100 of them in a minute. so cloakers will be in any system of any space in any numbers they wish, it's a simple reality, proven by years.i won't repeat to you arguements layed out on last 2 pages of this thread, you will have to read it yourself. at least refrain from answering if you don't even familiar with the ongoing state of discussion.my example concerning npc null space, what you would have knew if actually were intrested in the discussion and read at least latest posts, but you don't."
8/10/2014,"i'm sorry, i didn't know i was arguing with someone that used so many fallacies, clearly from the search of forum topics has already had many people like you, complaining about afk cloaking, and clearly, no one has agreed with you. you claim zero effort, i claim bullshit, there is no such thing as zero effort involved when you are flying such heavily nerfed vessels.you claim mwd+cloak trick, that is not the cloak's fault, attempting to pass the blame on a symptom without attacking the cause is a tad silly, don't you think? as for you don't count jumping gates and burning out of bubbles as effort? i sure do, specially when said bubble full of drones and there is an instalocker sitting on the edge of the bubble ready to lock you so you can't recloak. hey, i guess that is not effort either. mmm silly me, i guess my definition of effort is different from your's. wormhole is a universal way to nullsec these days? according to whom? you? clearly your experience is much greater then... you know everyone else that been saying you are wrong. guess that's okay, you are some kind of god with god knowledge about topics that we don't understand. mmm, i did study the topic that is called in question. though i fear that because my opinion doesn't agree with your own you attack me and call me a troll because... i don't agree with you, clearly my own study has result in much different opinion, or you studied different data from me, which my data says that cov-ops is... not very easy to get into. the nerfs that a ship receives for being cov-ops able, the fact that they can't ever fit a tank.i also studied that cloaking was also design to help people make sneak attacks, sadly because of local, whenever you enter a system everyone docks up, making you unable to get a kill... so people must sit /afk/ for days to trick people to come out so they can get that kill. days of their time is wasted when they could be doing something else to attack a supply line. i don't study the system? my friend, i think i understand the pains that a cloaker goes through all to well... a understanding that you seem to lack. i'm attempting to make a point for you. a point that you don't seem to understand, and that point is that why should my gameplay get nerfed so that your gameplay can be better then mine?"
8/10/2014,"no one can make a 24/7 work force? sure you can, get people across the seas, don't limit yourself in one time zone. and a single alt with covops cyno can bring in another 100 of them in a minute, so they can bring in another 100 heavy nerfed ships? or did they changed it to allow things other then covops only ships able to lock onto a covops cyno...i think that was another simple reality proven by years, was that only covops able ships/blackops battleships can use covops cynos. however if they use a normal cyno other things can lock onto it, of course that also means that their position gets broadcaster to who knows whom. thus allowing anyone in the system to jump in for beef! :d repeat the argument? i don't need you to repeat it, the cause for power projection is cynos itself. there really nothing to argue about. your example is conern about npc null space. i don't understand what point you are trying to make? are your concerns about cloaking? cynos? or 2 week old alts that are doing your relic sites because you were to slow to get there yourself?"
8/10/2014,"theoretically it's possible to run ""6"" 1000 times in a row on a dice. irl it, like, never happens. no, ppl won't be guarding all the gates in the sov space 24/7, it's just a game, they came here to have fun. and no camp aside from those counting dozens of ships and having enlisted pilots well trained in unclockin things will stop a covops, most of the times.more than enough to terrorize smaller entities in npc nulls, for example, because their members will often find yourself being alone at some time of a day, and can be easly overcomed with 2-4 those ""nerfed"" cloacking vessels, with blops hotdrop if needed as a support if some friend or two will try to rescue them. no, power projection is also an ability to buy and subscribe a bunch of expendable cloaking alts (and sometimes even share accounts to extend tz coverage) using iskies from moongoo or ratting in you well defended home space, place them all around constellation and effectively disrupt any activities of any entities in said npc nulls arn't capable to counterhotdrop you anytime, while effectively not playing those alts 90% of a time - simply because of the fact current cloaking mechanics won't penalize you for staying afk in any way. no risk, no lowered combat efficience - you can immidiately swich from tottaly afk and safed up state to fully combat capable and point a victim, than bring in others from nearest system. so the only sane decision you can make is don't even try to do anything; or join some powerblock. this leads to the same problem - large entities forming, other ppl leaving, stagnation rising."
8/10/2014,"well, then probably there is still chance you are not a troll and just so bad at this game that even me, humble nullsec carebear, have absolutely no problem travesring nullsecs and wh space any direction i need. and i haven't lost even one covops last year doing this. i even run relics while at it, sometimes when local is not empty. there is somethign very wrong with your vision of the game, when it was when you logged last time?oh, sorry, i'm doing it like hundred times a day, and i would say that efforts i spend to do one lv4 mission are much, much greater than those. while flying covops i don't note any efforts on my side like 95% of a time. and in case of camp, 95% of them are easly evaded. according to, like, every and each single guide for newcomers on nullsec exploration. i'm myself told the basics to some of them, and it didn't take more than a forum post to do so. and of course those who pvp and cloaks in nulls don't have like slightest problem with getting here. your lack of basic game's knowledge is frightening. the local actually is the only thing which still allows the like of you to have even those scarce opportunities to kill something. if not for it, even those hard boiled carebears that still stay there, would move out. the problem why you can't hunt and get kills without afking for days in local is in awfully plain and imbalanced cloaking mechanics itself. it's devoid your ""prey"" from any opportunities to save yourself, because the moment you uncloacked it's too late for her, and your friends cloaking in neigbouring system come to assist you in their ""underpowered"" combat ships. because your ""prey"" have like zero chance of surviving, she won't try to do anything at all and will stay at pos/station - no one like to have too many visits at eve's logistics and shopping ""exciting"" side. so you don't have opportunity to attack her at all. if she could at least somehow predict that attack is imminent - if she is ready to contribute some effort to it - than she would try to go out and risk more often. you don't want to understand other players' needs in your selfish pursuits for kills - no one want to be there for your fun, if they can't do their thing, if they are devoid of chance to survive or win - they will stay out of it.no, our gameplay should be equalized, forcing both parties to stay atk to be affective at what they doing, allowing the hunter to catch, and its victim - to evade. i layed out my concept here"
8/10/2014,"clearly arguing is pointless with you. i sall leave it to this. if you wish to change cloaking, then you will have to change local as they keep each other balanced. until local is fixed, i doubt we will ever see a change to cloaking. :) maybe i should of lead with this one."
8/10/2014,"you can't argue with me because you don't care to read what others say thus you can't actually present any arguments. and if cloak will be redone the way i proposed, i don't mind if local will be removed. should we call it a deal?"
8/10/2014,"actually, i kinda didn't read your last post because of you performing personal attacks, if you wish to ""argue"" then you should keep personal attacks out of it.i'm not arguing with you, i'm arguing with the fact that people are demanding changes to something that doesn't need to be changed in it current state. if you wish to change cloak, then you have to change local, it really that simple. i didn't say remove it, but it must be changed if you wish to change. next, i argue with your claims of cloak is the cause of force projection, again, that is not true, i find that such people using such lack of information to make that claim appalling.i've read how your cloak will be redone how you proposed, and i disagree with it. if you are going to change something, then you are going to have to change all the systems that it effects and is effected by, what is so hard to understand about that!? i'm sorry for the all caps, but i felt that it wasn't getting through your skull, like... at all."
8/10/2014,"thats actually example while me calling you a troll isn't a personal attack but merely calling a spade spade. in this board you have to post constructively. saying you are disagree with something, or that something isn't broken when you presented with arguments that it is isn't a constructive at all, you have to state your reasons, and you have to name those systems which will be ""irrevocably broken"" by those changes i proposed. i hardly can name one. if you don't intend to do that, than you are here not to contribute, but to ***tpost and will be reported."
8/10/2014,"i am posting constructively, i'm disagreeing with your implantation or suggested change. it called constructive criticism. look it up. report away, just shows how immature you are.as for your suggested system, there really no need for it. you already can't do anything to others cloaked, saying you can is frankly stupid, and you never flown a cloaker before. next. adding two modes to cyno? again why? what function? it allows you to be scanned down while having this second mode being activated? so basically why don't you just ask, covert ops ships can't use cynos, it would be so much easier, and again, you will still run into problems with people having super fast fits that you can't scan down. so here what i say about your suggestion... it provides no value to the game, what so ever, thus it should be disgarded, it not so much as it breaks stuff, as it makes thing more un-neededly complex when asking for cloakers unable to fit a cyno would be easier to implement.so what does it break? covert ops ships ability to be covert ops with a cyno.and it still doesn't fix the problem covert ops vs local, and it doesn't fix the problem of force projection. a interceptor, or speed fit ship would just fill the role instead. so the real question is.... my trollish carebear.... what does your suggestion actually fix?"
8/10/2014,"you showed again that you don't care to read or contribute, only troll and misguide. it was two modes for cloaking, not for cyno. and it was clearly stated so, btw. the reason: to penalize ability of those cloackers backed up by powerfull entitiy (so able to hotdrop significant cloaked forces small entities can't cope with) ability to disrupt operations of others while being afk. if you afk in active mode, you will be scanned and busted. if you afk in passive mode, than when you will return back to keyboard next morning and will find someone you want to hodtdrop, you won't be able, as it is now, to just come to where he is, point him and fire a cyno - you will need to switch to active mode first. and if your victim do her job diligently - like, dscan surroundings - she will be able to evade you, probably. if not, you will get it. atm you will get it unconditionally, she will not have any chance to survive, so when she see familiar face in local, she won't come out of pos protection. if she won't see local one day, she will leave nulls.the problem won't go if you won't be able to hotdrop. you still will have your covertcyno, so you can bring enough covert vessels to any system you want beforehand, and let them hang there. then if you point someone in one system, you can bring others from neighboring systems here. this is powerprojection, as characters and subscription are bought for isks, so do assets you'll need to cyno covert alts you bought to any system you like, thus allowing any large entity to stomp unconditionally on small enough ones."
8/10/2014,maybe you should reread my post.
8/10/2014,"i read your post intently, and it's full of ""it breaks, it's not needed, it's bring nothing"" stuff wihtout a single argument, thats why i reported it already.your other ""concerns"" answered in my post on this proposal itself: no, in active mode you won't be scanned right away (like you try to imply), it says that it would take considerable time to do so, so would happen only if you just left eve running and went to bed. if you changing your spots regularly, you won't be scanned even in active mode. and you don't need to stay in it forever to light your cyno. you just need to switch to it, which will take 20-30 seconds, and if your victim was oblivious and didn't check dscan, now you can do anything you could before - point, drop etc. then you can finish it and switch back to passive."
8/10/2014,"i honestly don't think you understand, the ones that are determain if we should back your ideas should not be the ones that have to bring a supporting argument on why they should, or shouldn't change itthat job falls under the task of the person that is attempting to make the change. as a player, and someone that you know, puts money into the game like everyone else, my only job is to tell you if i support or don't support your idea.at the moment seeing you haven't provide in compelling argument or evidence on why the game needs the change, my support is directed to the not supported group. any other misconceptions you wish to bring to the drawing board?"
8/10/2014,"i'll leave it to isd team, please delete this useless attempts to educate too."
8/10/2014,"and i clarified my views many times. your suggestion has no value at all, and i suggest you rethink your suggestion and make something more usable. you are like a kid, a kid that kicks and screams when he is told no. it sad really that people now have to post in the assembly hall to prevent their suggestions threads from being locked because they failed to use the search function in the features and ideas forum section."

8/11/2014,"multiboxers aren't bots. their efficiency is nowhere close to that of a bot, and they aren't normally grinding isk for rmt, like bots often are. and bots were never allowed, thus didn't become a widely used thing. isboxer on the other hand is allowed, has been stated as such, so a lot of people have them. if it was suddenly disallowed, thousands of accounts would drop. and all for what? so a few people can cry a little less while the mineral index doubles?"
8/11/2014,"i promise i'll read the whole thing later, but just skimmed bits here and there, is the tl;dr for this an activity based sov? so use it or lose it kind of thing?if it is, how would you overcome a large group being able to hellcamp a group out of sov?also, how would you deal with sitaution where groups just take the key systems and leave the pipes sovless? no small group could take that sov, since it would be logistically impossible to live in a space between 2 systems owned by a coalition."
8/11/2014,"afk cloacker can rise risks of anyone operating in the area while contributing neglectable effort to the levels those operations lose any sense. this happens because current cloaking mechanics won't penalize afk behavior and don;t allow to discern in any way can it attack atm or not, until he uncloaks, which is too late. afk gameplay is heavily penalized and made unfeasible in any other pvp-related tactics in eve what makes afk-cloaking stand out so much."
8/11/2014,"the part where he can't activate any modules while cloaked. besides, afk gameplay is not exactly ""penalized"" in a lot of situations in eve unless it's done so by the players. afk mining is only bad because other people will gank you, for example.a player who is afk cannot hurt you. this is not a problem.a player who is at his keyboard is legitimately hunting you. this is not a problem either. the only ""problem"" is that people feel entitled to have zero uncertainty, to not have to make a judgement call. which is, to be quite frank, tough ****."
8/11/2014,"the part it is too late when he uncloaked. which means additional tweaks are needed that will create competition after cloaker got to the keyboard but before he uncloaked.so it's penalized, in the end. you can't in any way gank afking cloaker while he can at any moment go from afk to combat state (with 0 delay in case of sb, and neglectable delay in case of force recon) and point you, then bring a support either from other afkers of from droppers and gank you.but he rises cost of operations in the area - thats the problem. if profit doesn't justify the risks than operations stop. he does it while staying mostly afk, because of huge element of uncertanty he able to create. as reiterated many times, uncertanty is so big and being ganked if cloaker is atk is so certain outcome that any entity not large enough to have rescue party online all the time will have to stop any operations in the area."
8/11/2014,"let's look into the problem from another level.what makes you vulnerable to covops hunters? three things combined: you can't fight back. hunters can easily track you and land in a close proximity to you whilst staying cloaked and without having to use any special tools, e.g. probes. you are not aware of where exactly the hunter is located at this very moment and what is he doing. those who propose changes to how the cloak functions are addressing the third point. however, this is actually a minor issue compared to others. a pvp vessel (or a bunch of them) disrupts moneymaking activities; having the cloak, not having it. it doesn't really help knowing where this vessel/fleet is and what it is. you can try to fight back but odds are you will end up being hotdropped by a larger force.first two points can be dealt with using the current mechanics. there are tactical and strategical solutions.first point. the tactical solution: use ships that are able to fight back. pretty much any cruiser size vessel equipped with 10mn mwd and weaponry that is effective in close range is able to fight back against most covert cyno ships. stealth bombers can insta lock you upon exiting the cloak, but they are stationary (due to cyno) paper-thin frigates that can easily be popped. force recons can't be killed that easily, but they have a reasonable recalibration time plus the time they need to lock a cruiser. you have more than enough time to overburn mwd and get out of cyno's point range.the strategical solution is the one members of gsf enjoy. :) no, it's not about having a large friendly fleet ready to help you. this is an option when you want to punish a shiny black ops fleet once, but it's an extremely ineffective way to protect ratters in long run. what i'm talking about is afktars that are cheap, effective and reimbursable, so you don't really care about losing them every now and then. you can argue that you don't want to join those big coalitions. well, the game is designed so you need to prove yourself worth of some isk faucets. and to prove yourself worth you need to either be an extremely good playeror to join to a large force. this is how eve is, and whether it is right or wrong is not this topic's subject.second point. the tactical solution: move around. all covops gankers can confirm that it is very hard to catch a ship that is constantly moving with high enough speed and unpredictable trajectory. a cloaked ship has a limited speed and needs to avoid wrecks and other objects. again, a 100mn ab/10mn mwd cruiser is what you need. make bookmarks around the system you are ratting in and warp to them first and then to an anomaly at a random range instead of warping directly from anomaly to anomaly. if you use an immobile ship to run anomalies - you just ask to be ganked, and it's not the cloak mechanics to blame.the strategical solution is to switch from belts/anomalies to some other isk-making activity, but it's not really relevant in this discussion.tl;dr use the current game mechanics to deal with either the first or the second point, and nasty afk cloakers will not be a problem for you. no need to change the way the cloak works."
8/11/2014,"the base environment does not exist just because of cloaks, or just because of local.as diametrically opposed facets of intel, they are the key players.a genuine solution to this would require both to be compromised.i find the assumption that hot dropping would remain unchanged, or that local being absent would somehow be drastically in favor of gankers, to be shortsighted and guilty of assuming too many details.local being absent would, in fact, be far more likely to entrench groups of players like alliances, because the second best alternative to local is something they already have.intel channels networked with players able and willing to relay critical information.hostiles entering foreign space do not have anything to replace local, that is comparable to this intel network.the cyno effect is unchanged, with the specific exception already described.the cyno ship cannot move, but it can still perform any task the same as any other current cyno ship.on-grid, the field visual and beacon would appear during the spool up period, but no ships could travel to it. their would be no system wide beacon at this stage.(if a ship executed a cyno off grid to other pilots, noone would know their was a cyno spooling up, as the system wide cyno beacon only appears once the cyno is active and ships can travel to it by jumping)now, in theory, a cyno ship can put a point onto the target, who would then be able to either make a run for it or try to attack.if they wanted, many ships could possibly run while attacking.i specified 30 to 60 seconds for the spool up as a balance point, since this would likely need testing.(maybe only the force recons could do 30, while all others did 60?)upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

8/11/2014,"so why can't every non-pvp module double up as a pvp module? why is exploration so special that you want to have 2 specialties at once?oh i see, so miners should have to split their loot, but exploration pilots should be able to do everything solo? i don't really see why. if you are an exploration pilot solo, then you can run away from combat, nothing stopping you doing that. but you don't want that, you want to explore, then suddenly be pvp fit if someone shows up. i honestly don't understand how you can't see why this is heavily biased.or 3. evade combat. if you are there for pve, you aren't there to pvp."
8/11/2014,"first off, a cargo scanner isn't required. it's a choice. secondly, most exploration ships have an extra high for a probe scanner specifically, so you didn't lose anything. thirdly, you are stating relic and data analysers, so you are talking about a dual exploration fit, for exploring both types of site. so you want to be able to fit for both types of exploration and you want to be viable in pvp.no. make your choices and live with those consequences."
8/12/2014,"yes, tl;dr - this is a sov based on you use it, or you lose itthe mechanic i've included in this scheme is that a larger group trying to take sov from the system owners have to play by the owners' rules. in this case, losing sov points (or gaining attacker points) can only occur if the attacker participates in activities that are based on the ""class"" or sov level of the system. sitting with 20 titans and 50 super's blapping everything out of existence does not gain the attacker any points (or cause the sov holder to lose any points) unless the class of the system supports the owner's use of the same ships. in that case, you'd need the titans/supers in order to break the activities of the system owners. you'll also have to remember, the attackers had to get their system sov to the level that they can make/use supers and titans. and if they've all run off to attack your system, then they are defenseless. i'm sure that there are some intricacies that i haven't figured out, but at least thats the idea i'd like to see happen.as far as pipes are concerned, if a group only takes ""key"" systems and leave empty space, they'll only have a small ability to upgrade the system they've taken. in this way, another group could push through the key system to take up residence in an adjacent system. this is actually a way to limit a different groups push to increase class (sov level) because you need adjacent systems at a certain class in order to upgrade the ""main"" system to a higher classthanks for the questions and the read!"
8/12/2014,"intel channel are useless without local, since people moving though a set of systems would be invisible. without removing power projection, the only thing that removing local would do is kill off pve, since nobody would sit around in a ship that wouldn't be able to fight back, able to be dropped on in a heartbeat. even the interceptor change nuked a massive amount of interest in doing anything non-combat in null, since it's so easy to get tackled now. removing local would be the final nail in the coffin. the only reason to be in null after that would be pvp, which would be dominated by whichever group can drop the most on people quickly. the quality of ratting and mining in any given area would become entirely irrelevant, since nobody in their right mind would want to be a pve pilot in that environment. hell, even i'd start running around nuking ratters, and i'm an indy pilot.when you talk about these type of changes, your problem is and always has been that you don't take into account the fact that people's behaviours would change. you treat it as both the hunted and the hunters would act exactly the same as they do now. that's not the case. the hunted would be exposed to increased risk and decrease activity, which the hunters would use the advantage of invisibility to increase activity."
8/12/2014,"lucas, i believe we would all appreciate polite logic, and the ability of all involved to be willing to question their own assumptions.please keep this in mind, as i know you to be quite passionate on certain topics.no, they would not be invisible.they simply would not be known so easily, as seeing the name listed in local chat.this is not equal to being invisible.also, it is only easy to be tackled, if you let a hostile on grid with you.once you have intel on an approaching hostile a few systems away, it is reasonable to expect pilots to align and prepare.expecting a scout to monitor gate traffic is also reasonable, and grants more than enough time to react.you are claiming that people's behaviors would change.allow me to point out how i agree with this statement:1. intel would not be reliably gathered from players docked in an outpost.the changeplayers would instead be needed to sit in proximity to gates, most likely at bottleneck points where traffic flow reliably needs to pass. this is not excessive effort, since it grants leverage to those players downstream who benefit from this intel.2. hot dropping loses value when other options exist with comparable results.the changesending a ship on grid with a target is one thing, especially if you need to hold a point on it.having a cyno pop, especially if a spool up is involved, becomes less than optimal.you can bring in the same ships outside of scan range, and have them warp to the target instead.this allows all involved to load the target system, and warp together.it also eliminates the vulnerable period of being locked down by a cyno field while having a hostile on grid.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

8/13/2014,"won't work in npc nulls, and in lows too. and it has meaning there - like, you have set some logistical facilities and keep market full up to your needs. but there are your reds around, living fence to fence with you and you don't want to sell them weapons they will use against you the same night. yes, they can still infiltrate your ranks to have access to market, but at least this will take some effort, and sometimes hopefully can be tracked."
8/13/2014,"two reasons - the simplest is because it would make it far to easy to (try to) disguise rmt as legitamate market activity, making it that much harder for ccp to hunt down. now, if you want to use the market to help run your rmt operation you have to go to out of the way stations without much traffic, and that makes it easier for ccp to find.second reason is because that's just not how the eve market works. it's not a store where you go in, look around, and if you don't like the product, the price or the owner, you go to a different store. it helps to think of the eve market as a commodities brokerage (because that's what it is). sellers indicate what goods they have and the lowest price they will accept for them. buyers indicate what goods they want and the price they are willing to pay. the market service, acting as a broker, matches orders on a lowest price out per station system. if two orders have the same price, the oldest order wins (iirc).the system doesn't need to be changed because, frankly, there's no compelling reason to do so. it works, and by working the way it does it helps limit rmt potential."
8/14/2014,"ok, so say a small group had and levelled a system. a large group then moves a fleet in and camps them for an extended period of time. surely that act alone, preventing the owners from continuing to use their system would reduce their hold on it. then again, a larger group could just bring the right class of ship for the system, just in numbers that blot out the sun and nuke the system into submission. they wouldn't then need to hold it, they could just cause enough disruption to make sure that nobody wanted to live there.i see, so it would promote holding clusters of systems i supposed, but it would still be pretty impossible for a small group to hold systems between clusters. it also then raises the question, does that mean that a small group that can only hold a system or two would be unable to grow a system to the max level? surely they would be better served to just rent from a group which can push and hold max level, much like they do now."
8/14/2014,"true, but that can happen in any system even now. this sov mechanic isn't designed to remove that particular war tactic, its designed to force system owners to use their system in order to own it, rather than the current ""pay for it once and keep it forever"" mechanic.also true. the point here is that if you want to have a small group, then you can expect to be able to grow to a certain amount (space-territory wise). if you want more territory, then you'll have to form a bigger group in order to support the space that will then support you.it doesn't bother me (personally) that goons have figured out a way to run a 12k person coalition. it does bother me that they've gobbled up all the space in the game. i'm in favor of a mechanic that can scale up and support as many people in the system as are willing to work for it."
8/14/2014,remove sov completely. see my signature.
8/14/2014,"they would effectively be invisible, since you'd have to treat any presence as hostile, meaning that they get hidden within false positives. you'd be constantly reporting ""someone"" in systems all over the place. which finely leads onto the next point.intel is only useful if it's accurate. with the names not showing, you'd have lots of false positives, so you'd spend a lot of your time running from nothing. in addition, you'd need people in all surrounding systems, since people could bust in from all over the place including wormholes (especially with the k162 change) and empty systems. without people to report, intel channels are useless.it's a game. not a career. why would anyone play a game to stare at a gate all day? be serious mate, the game has to be fun. i know you don;t care since it wouldn't be you doing it, but you can;t reasonably expect someone to just sit and do nothing all day as entertainment.so what you are saying is that people would have to turn the game into a career so other people in their alliance can play. in addition, those people who are sitting on gate would now need to be paid by those not sitting on the gates, thus reducing income. so your plan is reduce fun and income while increasing risk, and you think that's a workable plan?except you could still send in a tackler to lock down the target for the short time it takes for the cyno to spool. most targets would be soft targets, ratters, miners, etc. holding them wouldn't be a tough task.overall it's just an unreasonable and pointless change that would only serve to move more people out of nullsec, pretty much the opposite of what needs to happen. people need to be given a reason to go there, and not just the people that like to run around and gank everything, but everyday players who currently sit in highsec grinding missions because it's safe and nearly the same income."
8/14/2014,"some of my own quotes have been restored to original, for the purposes of context.i see no reason why you would expect a false positive.when on grid to your scout, who can just as easily be sitting on an exit bottleneck, that icon showing it's either blue or green is not hard to notice.if you miss the id, for whatever reason, alert your downstream post to verify friendly.also: in all seriousness, why wouldn't a friendly pilot simply announce their presence when passing through?most changes at least leave local in some delayed form, and that assumes the friendly is not answering unknown reports in the intel channel by volunteering that they were passing through.bonus point, why shouldn't a solid alliance have an advantage by having better quality intel?you always needed those people.they simply need to undock, or leave the safety of the pos shields.unless it is a central hub for travel, most systems have only one or two possible gates expecting traffic.if they were docked or hiding inside the shields, they had no way of knowing travel direction before.seriously, you are implying players close enough to be aware of gate flare, but unable to notice if the other guy cloaked up or showed on grid as hostile.unless your allies hide from you ...?point one, if the effort is too much, you are not cut out for the responsibility.point two: like a gate camp, someone in your alliance should be willing to step up. perhaps they have a second account they can pve with.null is built around team effort, and whoever does it better should expect better results.oh, i think you missed another change here.if the risk increases, so does the reward.in addition, your claims that people will be making a career out of doing things, (that they are implied to not like).let me point out how mining is so immersive, that people are documented quite often as being afk while performing it.how ratting has people min maxxing their ship fits so they can get it over faster, even despite how this compromises them towards pvp concerns.ultimately, anything described as a means to grind isk, is like this career you have mentioned.you may have noticed the other threads that suggest ways to make them less tedious, perhaps.next post!upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

8/15/2014,"your comments make it quite clear you have absolutely no experience running pvp isboxer fleets. as stated before if isboxer made you so godly then why isn't your corp running roughshod over everyone?i've shot myself with none of my ships being on the overview. the times i've done it were when i was in an incursion site killing npcs. during all the earlier incidents the overview was setup to show only the sansha npcs (and the gate). despite this some how i will find myself with a capsuleer combat timer. what usually gets me to notice though is the sudden decrease in hp of one of my dps. due to a recent run in with a fleet attempting to gank me i've changed my overview to include the typical gank ships. filters are setup to only show ships outside of my fleet etc. analyzing my setup there should be 0% possibility of targeting myself yet it still occurs. even under ideal situations isboxer's repeater doesn't place the mouse perfectly in the same spot on every screen. add to the misplaced mouse tendencies other problems like internet related lag and system related lag and you get all kinds of unintended actions(not to mention isboxer/eve interactions with all the low level drivers and such in windows). i'm pretty sure that's how i'm targeting myself once every +3 hours of gameplay. i'm not terribly surprised as i'm sure that when ccp was programming this game they had no plans for people to be running +10 copies of the game on the same machine. unintended actions and such are to be expected in such a complicated and unexpected setup.as for running incursions there's basically two different ways to target sansha. one is to use broadcasts on a non repeater ship and then using repeater to have the other dps target the broadcast. i find this method to be slow and very clunky for my setup. i personally use the overview and there's two ways to run that. you can run with tags which once again the act of tagging means you're not targeting your ships for reps or shooting sansha while you're doing the first set of tags on each wave. i personally have filters and a specific sorting method that allows for me to achieve singular targeting at least 90% of the time. it's much faster then dealing with the hassle of tagging (for my setup). as mentioned earlier isboxer's repeater function doesn't place the mouse perfectly on every screen and system/internet lag can further exasperate the problem resulting in incorrect targeting. so i'm generally slow and careful when it comes to important targeting. fortunately in vgs i can be kind of sloppy when targeting the tamas/niarja since they don't require much to explode. even so i have to be careful in otas for obvious reasons.watching isboxers run incursions on youtube you can see how they are moving much slower then you would controlling a single client. the very design of incursions allows for these slower movements to occur without penalty. pretty much every single site has the incursion ships appearing +30 km away which gives time to do targeting. if they are closer you're going to have to wait for your webs to slow them down anyway. my logistics aren't tied to isboxer and i've said that many times over. i've also said the reason they aren't tied in as part of my isboxer setup is because i like operating them at normal speed. also when something goes horribly wrong with isboxer or eve the logistics are unaffected. so i can at least keep characters alive till they warp off. like i've said many times i prefer my simple setup over the all in one complex setup because it's more robust and the logi are much quicker to react with. i will say though that the all in one setup is much lazier to use.i refuse to humor you're incredibly open ended nonsensical request to explain how a high end computer works. if you don't know how the 1s and 0s work or how the electrical pulses flow i'm not going to sit here typing out a paper explaining it for your. stop being lazy. io systems always have a limit in capabilities and when you're running 12 clients on one system you're hitting everything hard. inevitably there will be some burps on some clients. explain how to setup this magical ""good overview"" then. instead of continuing your usual posts full of vague assertions and outlandish claims. how about you actually explain something for once instead of ""because i said so so it must be true!!!!"". also while doing this keep in mind my earlier statement that i setup filters so that it's impossible for my fleet members to appear in the oerview"

8/15/2014,"i think that's what needs to change though. for the little guys to stand a chance, there need to be some way to make it less worthwhile to troll them out of their space. it doesn't really matter if someone owns the space or it is unclaimed if one group can still push everyone else out of it. i think this change would lead to people clustering their activity, but still dominating large areas of space, especially since renters would still be feasible. a 30k coalition would have no troubles smashing out the activity to hold all the space they need at the same time as bullying people out of their space.do you think your idea would change that though? the coalitions could still gobble up the space. realistically the idea needs to be adapted, so that there's no reason to bully people out of their space. just off the top off my head, and by no means well thought out, but perhaps it could scale reward based on average regional levels as well (regardless of owner), and scale base on the average owner level. this way, it would encourage people to try to hold all of their space at a high activity level (preventing the ""hold these system at a minimum level to stop others using it"" issue), as well as encouraging multiple owners in the same region to allow each other to prosper. that said, it would likely just result in those groups being absorbed into the coalitions and creating even bigger blue doughnuts.it's definitely a tough problem. i think force projection needs to be looked at at the same time as any sov change."
8/15/2014,"because it's hassle. do you want to have to type in local every time you jump? eve online is a game. a game. do you understand what a game is? it's something you play for fun, not to give you work to do between work.no, you didn't need those people. people who happen to be about post in intel, and that is all. with the change you suggest, those people would become a requirement, and they couldn't be doing their own thing, they would have to be employed solely to run intel.no. point 1, it's a game. you are suggesting they remove fun from a game. you are smoking something special if you think a game developer is going to seriously consider taking fun out of a game so people are forced into ""responsibility"".point 2. and it's still a game. i really don't get how you don't understand what games are made for. you can't honestly expect people to ""step up"" and treat the game as a job to be able to progress in the game.if reward in null was scaled up, you would never hear the end of the complaints from highsec. you'd also run into the issue where a group is able to game the system to earn the rewards with minimal risk (like what happens rights now) further creating an imbalance. and the majority of people would have too much increased risk, meaning that the level of reward is irrelevant. basically null would only be populated by the most hardcore isk generators and thousands upon thousands of gankers looking for easy kills (since let's face the truth, your suggested change is only going to be positive for that single group of people).and yes. pve is pretty boring and is due a lot of improvements. that doesn't mean adding risk to it makes it any less boring. all that does is mean you do the same thing but risk losing it all a lot more often.by perhaps 1 ship? yes, i'm sure the hotdroppers will cry themselves to sleep over 1 additional ship in exchange for near invisibility. it's clear what you want from this change, easy kills. you don't hide your intentions very well. but please, proceed to tell me i'm wrong and that's not at all what you want.and pve ships are soft targets. that's a well known fact. that's why people gank them. you don't have to be fail fit for a pve ship to stand no chance against a pvp ship. and the intel channels may show absolutely nothing, since there's not going to be a fraction of the population in null if your suggestion went through.and i'd like to see more people of all types in null. that's why i don't support ludicrous ideas like yours which would effectively make null empty. why don't you just head off to wh space where you can have what you want and stop trying to nuke the fun out of the game. you might consider eve your career, but most of us don't."
8/15/2014,"stripping out all the opinions you stated, this is the only fact you actually posted.yes, it is a game.here are a few more facts:games are the means we have for competing against each other.some are simple, and require little effort. tic-tac-toe or rock-paper-scissors are good examples.but the degree of effort you put into playing, also translates into the amount of satisfaction you feel when you succeed in playing.winning at a chess match, against a skilled opponent, can be much more satisfying than the same two players playing checkers.sure, not everyone is up to challenging efforts, or complicated strategies.the sov null section of eve is not for them, in many cases, unless someone else can shoulder the burden of micromanaging them to compensate.if you do not want to work with a group, as part of a larger effort, null is probably not the best fit.occasional solo play is fine, but you must accept that you are still relying on group effort to do this, and this lack of group connection during play will always be a weakness others can exploit.your opinion that bringing in more players, who by your definitions do not seem interested in group play, is contrary to what i believe are the games best interests in null sec.here are my opinions:just like we don't all get trophies for participating, sov null is not a welcoming place for all play styles either.otherwise high sec would be nothing more than an extended tutorial, and low sec just the buffer area.cloaking is not a finished product, as in this context the game ends in stalemates too often for player satisfaction.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/15/2014,"lol?so everything you posted was fact then? just carefully disguised as your opinions.but you aren't talking about ""more effort"". you are talking about making it so that someone has to sit staring at a gate in order for their friends to play a game. there's a difference between making a game more challenging, and making it tedious.totally and utterly disagree. your premise here is that chess is inherently more fun and rewarding than checkers, which is not the case. they are two different games, both of which can be equally fun and rewarding depending on taste.not to mention, you're not talking about chess and checkers, your talking about chess and wall staring. if you changed chess so that each side had to have someone sit staring at a wall, you'd have a hard time finding people to do that part for fun.i don't think you are the person that gets to decide what type of person sov null is and isn't for. until ccp employs you to make such calls, you're just a peon like the rest of us.and again, it's not to do with working as a group. you want to force people to perform dull, tedious tasks to replace a current game mechanic so it's easier for gankers to come in and destroy null players, thus increasing risk. there are other ways to increase risk which don't involve players being required to turn eve into a career.who said they aren't interested in group play? all i've said is that the current risk to reward ratios in null and high sec keep them playing in highsec, and that nullsec is underpopulated. it would be nice for people to be able to make the move into nullsec without feeling like they will instantly lose everything if they try. sure, players that don't want anything to do with anyone else probably won't like nullsec, but then no change short of adding concord would encourage them to move. i'm talking about moving people who are borderline. what you are talking about is creating gank heaven and nuking the current population into oblivion, forcing null into a state of ""pvp only""."
8/15/2014,"you are spinning this to one perspective of the game.you are putting forth the presumption that scouting, as in maintaining a post, is beyond the possibility of being even a part of acceptable play.you are suggesting that any players in a system are all responsible sources for an intel channel, despite the fact they may be afk or otherwise too busy to pay attention well enough to report such.(one would hope they took at least some form of protective countermeasure, in case hostiles did enter)you seem to re-define effort to exclude anything that involved persistent effort, such as watching a gate.and this, in combination with so many examples of players dual boxing with low attention demand tasks like ratting and mining already.these are observations of what you have written.please, feel free to correct me if i missed something.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/15/2014,"maintaining a post is beyond the possibility of being part of this game since it's boring as sin. nobody wants to pay a sub to sit around doing nowt. have you ever even remotely been involved in game design? pointless mechanics with no gameplay aren't a good idea.where did i suggest that?erm, no, persistent effort isn't the problem, but it has to be gameplay. a mechanic that has no gameplay put in just so people like you can feel that null sec players are having to work harder has no place.and you can't build mechanics based around multiboxing. multiboxing is not a requirement of the game, so they have to treat all characters as individual players and build mechanics for that. otherwise they risk blocking out all players who don't multibox.this is obviously going to go on for all eternity, since you are dead set on your idea of tuning null into wormholes with force projection being something amazing, so i'm going to leave this here. hopefully ccp aren't silly enough to blindly follow ideas like this which would ruin nullsec in the blink of an eye."
8/15/2014,"oh, now we are talking about game design! bout ******* time! first, lets talk about this, lets assume you know something about game design, first you will know that in many cases it takes more the one game mechanic to make something possible, but at the same time it could only take one of these mechanics to make something unfun. now if we are talking about afk cloakers. have you ever thought that it might be like this, not because of the mechanic of cloak, but due to the omnipotent intel? thus emergent game play has evolved to make that omnipotent intel.... lie? hmmm.... that the thing about a sandbox game, you have to look out for every possibility. something you learn about that in game designing, just saying. while yes, developers don't build mechanics around multiboxing, they have to look in the perspective of. how will someone abuse this mechanic? can it be broken by say... someone that is multiboxing? first i would like to ask. how do you know that will ruin nullsec in the blink of an eye? if wormhole was all that bad, i doubt we would of ever have seen this expansion pack that is purely design just for wormhole sec. as for ideas in general. the mechanic that is null sec needs a complete rewrite. to remove local we need new and better intel tools that while requiring work doesn't have such a steep learning curve that no one but a few can use them. intels tools should be like probes. almost anyways can do probes, but only the good few can narrow down that target in 10 something seconds! (exaggerated analogy, but it there to get my point across.) next, once real intel tools are put into place, and local remove then you will most likely see tools design to hunt down cloakers. next, we need a few other changes as well before such change can take place as well! power projection should be looked into, i don't feel that moving 10 titans, backed up by hundreds or even maybe thousands of ships should beable to be done at a drop of the hat. however that is just my opinion. until such changes are made. these three facts will remain factscloak is broken, local is broken. by both being broken in direct inverse to each other, they remain in perfect balance."

8/16/2014,"you don't need to ban isboxer, all you need to do is limit how many active accounts can connect from a single machine or ip (or both)."
8/16/2014,that's exceedingly a bad idea for so many reasons. there are many many non multiboxers that share the same ip. everything from a family or room mates that play to dorms/schools/apartments/condos/isp firewall/etcetc. one of my internet providers actually had a setup that made everyone that used their service have the same ip to those outside of the network.of course defeating your proposal would be easy as mac spoofing is possible and proxy servers exist galore. virtual os installs and multiple machines also bypass your one client per machine concept.ccp doesn't want to make it one client per machine as they'd lose at least half their subscribers. null/lowsec movement for non nullblock members would become a nightmare as cyno alts would be harder to use since few have multiple gaming computers at the same desk........
8/16/2014,this has already been addressed (in this very thread) on multiple occasions. it's a terrible idea.
8/16/2014,"um... i am an it guy, and you are 100% incorrect.andccp already does this if you use a trial account. try it. it will only let you log onto that one account on the same machine.people share a sub-net ""mask"", your ip is unique to your singular connection (whether it is a random or static one every time you connect). if you hook 2 computers up in the exact same room on a router, both will have different ips (i should know i have 3 in my apartment as i build them for a living). your ip is how the internet determines where to send and receive information from.each connection is unique. it is however possible to get a second computer to mimick the ip of another, but this must be done manually and causes a shitload of network issues. so you can have 20 computers in one home, and each will have a different ip.also the eve server client can determine which machine is hooked up where and how many clients are running on it, it's how they restrict account that are trial. try it, open a trial account then try and log in on a normal account, it will not let you as long as that trial account is logged in, but hop on another computer right next to it and you can log on all of them, as long as no trial account is open on that computer.if they shared an ip this would not be possible. (not to mention you can look at the ip yourself of your own computer).my specific tech degree is in internet security and network forensics. so i know for a fact you can easily do what i suggested with 0 issues, and as i stated above"
8/16/2014,"just want to fix something for you mr. i have a degree in internet security and network forensics.the patcher client system, you know that little thing you log into. can always see that the account you just logged into, is a trial account, thus it can have a command set into it to prevent you from logging into other accounts on that computer with that client and patcher open. of course you can always try to open a different patch, but a command can still be stored to ""read"" if there is another patcher open and pull data from it... that is not something bound by your ip, but a simple script/programming put into the client and patcher system itself.... so mr. i have a degree in internet security and network forensics.... why did you fail to think about that part? as for your ip, or internet protocol, the address assign to your router is provided by your internet provider, it specially bound to your modem....of course the modem itself can assign it own address to your computer as a way to keep track of the inbound and outbound data, but that address can't be seen by the outside world, it can only be seen by that router/hub/modem and your computer. it also why when you attempt to assign the same internal address to two or more different computers, bad things happen, because your router/hub/wireless sees all inbound traffic and outbound traffic from those two or more computers as the same, so in theory if a two computers open up an app that connects to the same server, they both will receive copies of the packets from each other. thus where the bad things happen. my own degree doesn't have special name attached to it. according to my college i am a cis major, which also stands for computer information systems. my side isn't really specialized networking, but i do have some general knowledge of it, because well.... i have to learn about it. :)"
8/16/2014,"this falls along the lines of your claim to be a 7yr bittervet on the thread you started along this same line. i'm not even an it guy, but i can give half a dozen ways to bypass any way you can think of to run more clients than you deem to allow me to. hell, when i was deployed to afghanistan years ago, i was able to connect to eve even through all the methods used to keep me from playing games.i'm also old enough of a gamer to remember connecting to various mu*s from university computer labs, having to explain that the five characters coming from the same ip were my friends and myself, not just me."
8/16/2014,"so, did you get that degree after sending 50$ to a nigerian ""university""? lo and behold: the wonder of proxy serversvirtual machines are also an interesting topic, when you ponder the question of how in the world those evil hackers managed to crack the top security measures that prevent logging in a regular and a trial account."
8/16/2014,"first off, it's not about unfun mechanics existing. some mechanics are not particularly fun, and they are optional. the issue here is that with the suggestions placed, you'd not be able to survive without someone doing the job of staring at the gates, since that's the only way you could see people coming. people do not want to make a job out of playing games.and no, i don't believe afk cloaking was born out of omnipotent intel. it was born out of people realising that they can cause disruption while they are asleep. it's a joke that people have gone back and tried to make up this backstory to cry about local. and you can whine about how strong local is as much as you want, but the fact is it's been around too long, there too many other mechanics that wouldn't work well if it's gone (force projection mechanics pretty much across the board) and would have to be rethought out at the same time, and nearly no gameplay benefit to it's change. basically the only people that would be happy with the change are gankers and wormholers. yes. you have to look at that as a potential pitfall, but go back and read what nikk wrote. he wasn't saying that multiboxers might break it, he was saying it's ok to make a boring mechanic with no gameplay since people just multibox anyway. so no, you can;t build a game mechanic under the assumption that the only people doing it will be multiboxing. wormholes are pretty bad. their population is quite low, there's a small core of people who like it. seriously, go to fanfest, they had graphs and stuff.but then again, we're not talking about wormholes are we. wormholes randomly link, so you can't easily get to a specific hole, they have no force projection, they restrict ships based on class, they have no stations, you don't have to pay or place modules for sovereignty, and when you mine and rat, you don't have a public facing index and api stats to show that's happening. you're talking about taking one mechanic from wormholes, dumping it in null, massively increasing risk and expecting that not to just force isk generation back to highsec quicker than you can blink. do you actually understand how small the gap is between null and high sec income? sure, power projection should be looked at, as should several other mechanics if you want to turn null into a fixed set of wormholes. but consider the benefit gained from such a massive undertaking. what would be the result? do you honestly think it would be worth the development time over other smaller changes which wouldn't alienate the existing null community?and no, those are still opinions, not facts. cloak and local are working exactly as intended. you don't like how they work, but that doesn't make them broken. i in fact see the good use of cloaks quite often when we are out on an op. seems to me the only problem is you try to use cloaked ships as tacklers, and get upset because people don't hang around to get ganked. use the right tool for the job. drop the cloaky nullified tengu and use an interceptor if you want to catch fully aware and prepared pilots."
8/16/2014,"where did i say that? i just would rather live in null. if i wanted to live in a wormhole, i would."
8/16/2014,"i greatly enjoy cloaking, as a blockade runner, i get by poorly prepped gate camps and laugh at them, some gate camps are a challenge, but you will be surprised what a little intel will do, and finding a clever book mark to avoid those bubbles places at the back of the gate. however, i'm not daft enough, to not admit that cloak and local is broken. yes you are right, they are working as intended, but they are still broken. :) i agree with a few people on the forums that i think cloaking should work very much like submarine combat. you either don't know the submarine is there till the last moment, and they come and bomb your ass... or your always vigilant, managed to scanned the said submarine down and either a ready yourself for him to come to you, (get those smart bombs ready!) or go to him and attempt to catch him while he as the advantage ""ie cloaked"" however that is my opinion on the subject how it should work. of course with how the current iteration of omni-potentate local intel, power projectiong, and so on, lots of things need a rework. if things will stay the same, and that these three no four facts if you include my job, will also stay true until many things, which will take time, and hell of a lot better suggestion quality from the community. like you all should be suggesting tools that don't focus on hunting cloakers, but help you make local irrelevant if you put in some work into said tool you get a much better reward. cloak is brokenlocal is brokenby both being broken, they are balanced.and i will continue to fly my blockade runner and laugh at poorly prepped gate camps."

8/16/2014,"with the current ice system, an is boxer 20 man fleet (which seem to be in every single system with ice in it) can strip the belt in less then 10 - 15 minuets, meaning no one else can get any ice, or very little of it.some might say gank them, well that would be a great idea except they are now using skiffs with larger tanks then battleships.now while i am fine with 2-5 people isboxing, and mining, i think that ""due to the low quantity of ice in each spawn"" in each belt something needs to be done.suggestions:1.) remove the ice belt spawn timer.2.) put more ice in the ice belts.3.) limit the amount of accounts you can have logged in from a single machine/ip at the same time (10 maybe?)4.) go back to the stationary belt system.5.) 1+26.) 1+2+3anything else anyone suggest which solves this issue. i was hoping this would be addressed in the industry update this summer but it wasn't."

8/16/2014,"actually my main probably has more killmails then you do. i'm 5 year 0.0 veteran, 2 year wh veteran, and one of the veterans from the bob/tri war during trinity.a problem is a problem. and many as individuals do not have the resources to gank a 20+ man fleet of isboxing skiffs. many others do not visit these forums and have no idea who code is or how to contact them.for a blanket issue that permeates the eve universe, you need a blanket solution. not a pinprick here and there. you need a solution that will force them to stop. not simply inconvenience them for a few hours.and in case your wondering if you gank their fleet they simply go buy an entire new one, an isboxer ice fleet makes upwords of 20-30 billion per day with current isotopes prices. you ganking them only makes them laugh and shake off what amounts to a tickle. this is not an issue that can be solved by force of action in game randomly with the occasional gank. unfortunately it is too big and must be delt with at the source. which is an individuals ability to connect that many clients from a single ip. ccp already restricts your connections if you have a trial account active, so this is easily doable."
8/16/2014,"considering your inability to solve this problem or to find people to help you solve this problem without crying on forums, i'm going to call bull**** on this one. post with main, or you're just who you appear to be.i have it on good authority that 2 oracles can take out a skiff. surely someone with all your experience can find enough people to gank a skiff fleet.as i see ice fields in highsec empty of miners, not to mention all the ones in null that you aparently don't have as much experience with as you claimed prior, this isn't a problem in need of a blanket solution. what you are asking for is for ccp to forcibly reduce another player's ability to make isk, for no reason other than it cuts into how much isk you can make.so do it repeatedly. their income will drop drastically if they have to stop mining and buy new skiffs a couple times a day. you were able to come up with an arbitrary number for how much they can make in a day, but that assumes they can mine all day. if there is enough ice for them to mine for 23.5 hours, then why aren't you in there mining alongside them. again, you asking for dev intervention in what is a personal probllem.how can a localized issue in one small section of the available game play on this game be so big you must attempt to force an entire segment of the playerbase, that spans all the different activities, to change their play style simply because you can't think of another way to make isk, even with all that experience you aledgedly have?"
8/16/2014,"ummm, hmmm... i was thinking about answering this one nicely, but i really can't... so, basically you are a bitter vet that can't handle someone stepping on your profit margins? mmm, maybe you should find ways to step on their pofit margins instead of whining on the forums? mmmm, i would like to get where these numbers are coming from that you know said multi-boxer is making 20-30 billion isk a day, do you have proof of this? see, the problem we are having with people making ""please ban multi-boxing software like isboxer"" is that, that all it is, is a whine thread, people fail to provide proof that they are gaining an unfair advantage over other players. i mean, if you have proof, true numbers, statistics, screen shots, and ectra, then you may have a working case for you.... however if you don't have these proof, well, you are sorta-s.o.l.and this is how the thread will go about, you will whine, other people will join your whining, and then others will join in to whine back. then this thread will become nothing more then a whine thread, till at some point people get bored and stop whining on this thread and make a new thread with their own whine.... so.... if you want to build a strong case vs something, make sure you bring your proof at the start.... ""claiming you are a 5 year vet experience so what i say is right"" has the same meaning as me making a claim that my own bitter vet experience makes demands that all neutral objects be protected by concord once again. and they take away that stupid fing safety button so i can truely can-flip gank noobs again."
8/16/2014,"you appear to be labouring under a false assumption.the csm doesn't get to make ccp do anything. we can ask them to look at things. we can give our opinions on things they ask about. that's it. we talk to ccp. nothing more. it's a useful thing to be able to do, but there's no power there.anyone who says 'i will do this' is misguided at best."
8/16/2014,i never implied that the csm can make ccp do anything. save your talking points for election season.

8/17/2014,"i just wanted to weigh in on this too!as far as i know, this is done on the pc, not on server side. when you launch a client, it looks at the other running clients and disallows multiple clients if a trial client is running (or a trial client if non-trials are running). if you ran 2 machines on the same ip, you can run both (on different machines).yes and no. when you connect 2 machines to a single connection, they will have separate internal ips (the 192.168.x.x or 169.254.x.x addresses, among others). whether or not they have multiple external ips is based on the network they are connected to. with a home network, you will generally only have 1 ip, and businesses often have a single ip for the general traffic with separate ips for servers and the like. larger universities and such may own a large block of ip addresses, allowing them to distribute more external ip addresses to individual machines, but most smaller universities will be limited on how many they have, to the point that they have to share. the public use networks they have will often be limited to a few.consider that under ipv4 addressing there are only 4.2 billion unique ip addresses, and you'll see why it's unreasonable to think that every internet enabled device in the world would have it's own unique address.again, internal addresses, perhaps, but external, generally no. and connecting them to a single external ip is as simple as plugging them into a router/modem configured with a single outward facing address. when a packet is sent by the router, it uses pat (not exclusively but let's simplify here) to alter the local ports so it knows which internal machine to forward responses to.you might want to check if you took the right class. it sounds like you might have accidentally taken a bakery class instead."
8/17/2014,looks like someone is echoing your concept for missioneersmmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>
8/17/2014,"it can't really be both.the thin is, it's still your opinion they are broken. basically they don't wok in the way you think they should, that isn;t the same as being ""broken"". it's just a mechanic you don't like. the way it is, cloaks are useful for disguising the type of ship from d-scan, preventing people tracking your movements within a system and for providing on grid intel and surprise attacks. that's what they are designed for, and they fulfil their purpose very well, so well in fact that there's no null group that doesn't use covops cloakers.i don't suggest tools for either. i think cloaked ships are huntable enough. sure, afk cloaking provides a little too much benefit to the effort it takes, which is why i'd take a look at the being afk element (not just for cloakers), but cloaking in general is a good mechanic, as is local intel in it's current state."
8/17/2014,"clearly, and your opinion of my opinion, is still your opinion. anyways, moving on. i'm a strong believer in asymmetrical balance, if you don't know what it is, then i suggest you watch this video here:"
8/17/2014,"lol. moving on because you want to deem working gameplay as ""broken"" because you don't like the way it works.i disagree. i don't think it create perfect balance at all, and where you say it results in unsatisfying gameplay is because you are trying to use cloaking for something it's not designed for. you want to make cloaking even more powerful by further removing cloakers from intel, requiring even more work on the part of their victims to evade them in addition to their already powerful benefits. that's not producing asymmetrical balance, that's taking a game mechanic and buffing it well beyond that of any other mechanic creating a massive imbalance. cloakers without local would replace anything else. there would be no reason to ever use a non-covops ships for hunting people down solo, just like in wormhole space right now, where cloaky t3s are the standard choice for anyone nipping into wormholes to score some ganks.so in essence, your issue is you don't think people work hard enough for what they currently get, and yet the parts you would like to change would only negatively affect people wanting to pve in null. honestly, what gameplay benefits do you think it would have to anyone beside a ganker? you want to jam in some sort of chore, or a tedious configuration game just for people to be able to get enough information to even begin playing the part of the game they actually enjoy.i very much doubt it. they've worked as they have for years, several other mechanics are built around them, and any significant change to them would likely result in a mass exodus of nullsec. and all for what? so a handful of gankers that want to tackle with cloaking ships can get their wish granted?out of curiosity, who are you? since you've chosen to post with an alt, it's not even clear where you even stand in this entire discussion. it certainly comes across like you are someone that has little idea about how people that actually live in null interact, which is why you are happy to toss around ideas which would literally destroy and entire class of gameplay, to replace it with what effectively already exists in wormhole space."
8/17/2014,"who am i? i am a person that has been playing off an on, for a number of years. i am a person that frowns when people say i have little clue how people actually live in null sec. you are right, i don't know how other people live in null sec, i only know how i live in null sec. i am a blockade runner, i bring high value, but low cargo space costing things down to null sec and sell it to a prem. i am a person that has to constantly deal with gate camps seeing i don't exactly have an alt that is fitting with as a blops alt, nor do i specially care about setting up a cyno alt when i'm willing to ship to just about any null sec alliance, unless said null sec alliance ends up in my black book. i am a person, that is bored with their job of doing this, constant, and no real change to the meta when it comes to attempting to capture covert ops ships. i recieve no challenge or even have a reason to step out of my comfort zone. where do i stand on the issue? i stand in the future. i stand in a position, that i believe if we can get something really ******* creative, then we can improve game play for both sides....where do i stand? i stand at a position that can look upon a subject and can see that there is more then just four corners to this topic, oh so many more.... and you my friend... are literately only looking at one corner. my friend, destroy an entire class of gameplay? i'm trying to do everything but that! it is why i keep trying to suggest to people that maybe it time to take a step back, lets not look at the problem as a problem, instead lets look at it as an opportunity. i am the type of person that will give someone a hint, then allow you to develop the solution. i am the player that believes with all of their blood, and willpower, that with all the players that play this game, surely there is someone that can come up with a creative idea for the problem that doesn't exist.... i want to believe with all their might, that only a small fraction of them are like you lucas, and don't bother to read the entire post, the entire subject before forming their opinion.... i believe, that you are only the vocal minority, and that the majority want new and initiative ideas for not just this, but for all sections of eve online. what is my stance? what is my opinion? who am i? why, i'm like you. i am a player of eve online. and i believe, that eve online can be much more then what it is now."
8/17/2014,"lucas, i have keep up with this thread i started and i have read each and every post. i suggest you do the same. you are still missing the point, i think you may be arguing for arguments sake. the issue raised is that (not broken, not not working as intended) is that current mechanics revolving cloaks and afk gameplay are not fun. please do not put more into it than that, if you want to argue more, please feel free to start your own thread.that being said, you do make a lot point that echo others, that does not make it a fact, it makes it a popular opinion. facts are not always popular, and sometimes a popular opinion is a good idea, most times it is not as it has not looked at the crux of the issue only the symptoms. if you go back and read some of your arguments and opinions, you will see that you desire a change or lack of change that would make living in null sec easier. no one here is suggesting making things like wh space.we have discussed modifying current intel gathering into something more involved that takes activity to use. currently local is local, it is used for many things including spam to seeing who is in system. to be honest having lived in null for quite sometime i do not see how it is tied to force projection as cyno's show on your overview not localin practice, even in null when you see new face in local you hit dscan to see what they are in. dscan is not ties to local.i digress, this thread is not about abolishing local, nor about new intel mechanics with exception of finding cloaked vessels.this thread is about how to change existing mechanics to make it possible to hunt cloaked ships in a manner that would dissuade afk play.please stop derailing this thread, start your own. or stay on topicthank you."
8/17/2014,"so long story short, you don't understand how 99% of the null population plays. so change your gameplay. i receive no challenge mining rocks in high sec, so i don't do that. i don't leap up and down screaming about how it should be changed for those that do. and i'm not really sure how making it harder to track covops ships would provide you with more of a challenge.certainly doesn't seem that way. seems like you want to take an enormous dump on anyone that wants to actually live in null. perhaps it's because you trade in null and are worried that with the industry changes your margins will be cut short, but if you push for a change which annihilates pve in null, then you won't need to worry.lol? so you are looking at it from the point of view of a covops hauler, not even considering how covops ships are already used in null and not looking at people who live in null every single day, and yet i'm the one who's looking at just a single angle?and yes, destroy an entire class of gameplay. you want things to be the way you want them to be played, and everyone else, who might i add actually lives in null sec, can go die in a hole. people don't want to sit around staring at gates all day to be able to report who's about. it's boring. and you don't care because you wouldn't need to do it. so if we aren't on board with your ideas of ""turn null in wh space"", then we aren't creative? because some of us think of ideas that don't start with ""nuke local"" we're somehow below you? get over yourself mate."
8/17/2014,"this impiles using alts for survival, not only scanning/scoutin alts, you have to control 2 windows in real time, one you are ratting with, another on some gate. if atm you can afford some delay after hearing gate flash from scout window - as whoever initiated it will still be shown in local - now you absolutely have to alt+tab to this window asap - even if you under the heaviest fire from rats, applying tremendous efforts just to survive - or you will lose the intel piece.need to multibox just to sustain reasonable amount of income in nulls/wh is what signifies rather twisted game mechanic, imo. i won't say for wh space, but in nulls cooperation with other players which includes delegating scouting and intel gathering to separate party (which implies sharing your income with them), won't be profitable for you enough to justify ratting here, all risks acounted for, as you still have hs as a solid and almost risk-free ratting option. and lucas kell already mentioned moral ambiguity of game designer's decisions forcing people to stare at gates all day long just to allow somebody play his game.if it will be automated function, like you just set some option and become visible to all your blues in local - then i agree with this point. if you will need to do it manually in every and each system you traverse - this is another bad design decision which contributes to quantity of mindnumbing clickfest activities, and we have plenty of those in eve already, please, don't.point one: if effort is too much, you will have mostly empty nulls as of today and anyone still operating here do it mostly only because he at least has a local chat which will allow him to get to safety long before threat will knock to his door (which is usually means you are deadman). so less targets, less content. point two: by restricting nulls only to team activities you are doom it to stay sparse-populated again. it's obvious that many people prefer to play solo, or stay out of big entities. and they will keep their tastes whatsoever. banning them from here you are again devoiding yourself and other null dwellers of content. i don't agrue that collective gameplay should be rewarded heavily - i argue your vision of ""you are either play collectively and in big entity, or you will have no chance to survive"". this is horribly wrong game design, imo. it should be ""being a member of small entity will allow you to survive for shure and have a decent income, not less than you would have got from incursions in hs, but you could got much, much more if you have joined something bigger"" - this is the aproach that will drive more people to nulls, making everybody's life more intresting.thats what my proposal of splitting cloak into two modes stems from. having it this way you don't need to have 5 alts on all wh exits in the systems to survive anymore, you only need one character and you need to stay vigilant (which is serious challenge in eve's reality taking into account hours and hours of repetitive actions during everyday pve activities). now you don't need those infeasible aproaches with delegated human guardians at gates, neither you absolutely need to have a big entity backing you up just to survive, or become a seasoned multiboxer (which, again, imo, is a bane of all mmos and ruins immersion greatly), you just have a solid mechanics using which you can play with you character and survive cloackers' attacks in most cases if you manage to maintain situational awarness all the time (mind the proposed ability for cloackers to monitor dscan activity of a victim, which allow them to exploit loopholes in their dscan patterns)from the first glance, one can say it will leave hunters with even less kills then before. but you are missing very important point, a psychological one. most people are reluctant to lose ships - you won't change this, take it for granted. they know that if cloaker gets close to them, they are most certanly busted - aside from the cases when you have backup force always ready to react to your disstress call (i.e. you are member of big entity). staying aligned won't help much, there are many cases when your actions will be predictable and hunter know them too. thats why they will safe up and stay such untill threat are gone. if you just give them a hope, it will be enough for them to go and take that risk - because of this elusive sensation that their fate is in their hands. they still will make mistakes, and will lose their ships, anyway - no one (aside from bots) can dscan indefinetly for hours, without missing a beat (remember, proposal to grant cloacker with ability to see dscan patterns of the victim). but this will trick them into thinking they can change something, if they put some efforts, transforming them (in their minds) from helpless victim to slick and tidy elusive proficient ratter of all belts. that is the mindset they need to feel good.this will stop driving solo players and small entities out of nullsecs, and as their numbers will grow, your chances to meet some totally oblivious victim, or find some loopholes in defenses of less oblivious ones will grow in tandem."
8/17/2014,"i understand what the post is about, and i've seen it many times over. it's not like this is a new concept. and yes, afk gameplay is a little bit of an issue (though less than most claim). it's solution is simple, attack the afk part (both with and without cloaks). that can be toyed around with without having to mess up any other mechanics.certain people though like to dive into any conversation about afkers with ""kill local, it's the only way!"". they'll do it without fail, every single time. the problem with that idea is that almost every other null mechanic would need to be destroyed and rebuilt to facilitate that, and the net benefit would be... about zero. it wouldn't be any more fun for the majority and in fact would add the requirement for people to have meaningless chores within the game (something ccp have explicitly stated they are against) just to obtain the ability for their mates to have fun.while it wasn't about that, it's pretty much turned into that, since that's always the argument tied in with adding ""hunt cloaked ships"". you aren't going to be able to have a conversation about hunting cloaked ships without the usual crowd chiming in with ""waah, local intel must die"". it just doesn't happen. history shows us this."
8/17/2014,"i honestly don't think you yourself know how null sec works... just saying, everything you say... like conflicts with what most null secers do in null sec... delete local? i never said that, i did however say make new tools that might beable to take over for local and even be better with local if you became skilled with it. however, you know what else i said? i said that that would most likely take a lot of time, and ******* effort to even come up with ideas for these tools. you recieve no challenge from mining rocks in high sec, so i don't do that, okay. that fine, not every game play type is for everyone, but clearly someone wanted to make it more exciting, just look at the current changes to industry. they made it hell-ova more challenging and more engaging, but you know what else they did? they made it so that that it still easy to access. next, i want to get something off my chest, cause clearly you also know nothing about null sec. local works for both the prey and the predator, without local and no true tools to take over for local, a predator will have to stop at each and every system that shows activity on the map in the last hour, then take time to scan down that system and hope they are still there.which they very as well might of moved on, or not even be there. and they have defender advantages. you know, something called safe spots. though hey, i know nothing about how null sec work. so i clearly didn't know any of that information. certain doesn't seem like i'm helping both sides? well, because i have noticed that you don't even read the entire subject, you just take key subjects, out of context, and attack me. that's fine, just shows how much knowledge you have on how null sec works. ""lol? so you are looking at it from the point of view of a covops hauler."" you ******* right i am, and my view seems to be more educational then your point of view, of someone that i highly doubt, that you even put your big toe into null sec, let alone low sec.finally ""so we arn't on board if your ideas of turning null in wh space."" clearly you still can't read, and your lack of comprehension skills is starting to get frustrating. once again, i never said nuke local. what i said was both local and cloak are broken, but at the same time, because they are broken they are balance. what i said was that if you want to find ways to ""change cloak"" then you also have to look into ways of ""change local"" there is no if ands or butts, *you may now laugh due to the word butts. hahahahahah* with your next post in which you respond to my post, if you do, though i can already see the pattern you will, please actually read not only all of this post, but also all of the subjects that came before it."
8/17/2014,"like what?or are we supposed to just assume from you saying that that you must be right? yes, i understand. you want to replace local with tools, which would involve removing local as it currently exists, and ends up with people performing tedious tasks just to get a level of intel high enough to do what they actually want to do. it's like having to play a game you hate to be able to play a game you like. they change industry because it was mind-numbingly boring. a whole bunch of repetitive clicks to accomplish simple tasks. the ideas you put forward, for effort based local, this is putting in exactly what it is they removed with the industry changes. they want people to spend more time actually playing the game, and less time fiddling around with the ui to get there. the scan probe changes were the same. they started off that you had to manually fly around dropping probes around people. then they moved it to draggable probes where you could drop more with skill. now you can always drop 8 in predefined formations. except the predator will not change. they have to fly to systems with activity, and scan as it currently stands to see if people are undocked and outside of a pos. and no, you seem to no nothing about how null works. i'm wondering if you know how cloaking works too, since you still seem to be acting as if a covert ops ship should be used as a tackler.does it? seems like that would be an enormous no to me."
8/17/2014,"lol, the arrogance is overwhelming here. you are in university or college, right? you still seem to have that ""obviously i know best"" attitude that kids tend to grow out of eventually.and once again, no they aren't broken. they just don't work the way you want them to. i don't want to change cloaks. and no, if you were to change cloaks it could very easily be done without changing local. again, you just think they must be changed together, and that's your opinion."
8/17/2014,"didn't anyone tell you?! clearly hot dropping works exactly like a tackle, ending sarcasm. you seem to circle jerk the problem. do you have a real opinion on the subject? you just argue, for argument sake? how do you know the predator would not change? you clearly are placing all the blame on one side, and honestly are not thinking about both sides of the subject. sad really, i'm poking holes in your argument, and you don't seem to like that. you have no value to add to the subject anymore, and i shall be ignoring any future post from you. you have no clue how null works yourself. you also seem to lack understanding in human nature. please, troll, go to a different corner of the interwebs and cry there, there is no use for you here."
8/17/2014,"arrogance? i'm sorry, i didn't know simple fact was arrogance. i am in college, you will be correct there. also, as for my opinion, you are right, that is my opinion, and just about everyone else as well. i mean hell, if you know how to use the search function, you will see that every thread like this dies in roughly the same manner. people demand change to afk cloaking because they can't find him, or they got hot dropped. other people say, you can't change cloaking until you change local because cloak is the number one balance to local. and the thread dies, and a few days down the road, a new one pops up... and it continues that way over and over again... this is why i keep telling people, if you want to get something changed, then you must be really ******* creative with the idea you are about to post."
8/17/2014,"i've already said there is nothing wrong in changing it. may be you have an actual proposal then? or may be at least you want to share your vision of how exactly these connections between local and cloacking you are keep talking about work? i.e. start to be constructive, at last. yea, you made a good point, i give you that. like, 3, or 4 times already. i got it, so everyone else did. now what?"
8/17/2014,"now what? i gave suggestion a while back, it not something i can just whip out of my arse, it something i'm willing to work with others to produce, sadly, i have a hard time working with others in threads because people comes along and says. ""this is bad!"" and starts trolling, disrupting my work. basically again, i've said once before, that if you want to create new intel tools, you can to create intel tools that don't just target one group of players, they must target all groups of players. providing new ways of gathering information, be it (now this just an example, nothing to be taken to ******* seriously.) have tools that work based off of your signal type, and strength, and have certain signal types be a counter for other signal types. this is turn can bring in a new class of ships that are design purely to gather intel, and a new job focus to gather said intel. for example, lets take the minmatar ships, they tend to gravitate to the ladar sensor strength, have it set so that higher your sensor strength is, the easier it is to detect other ships around you and in the system with you. however, higher that strength is, the easier it is for them to detect you as well! so it will also give new fittings to have as small sensor strength as possible to stay hidden as possible, of course the cost to that is that if you are captured, e-warfare would wreck you. set it up so that the ships can detect other ships using the same sensor type as them much easier to ships using a direct reverse sensor type from them are harder to detect! i could give like detail stats on how it could work, but i simply threw this idea out as an example, something that targets more then just cloaks, something that targets all of the player base as a whole."
8/17/2014,"we aren't only talking about hot dropping. you are talking about flying cloakers around to find targets. and i explained why the predator would not change. go ahead and read it.lol, really not. you are repeating yourself and when you get yourself lost you seem to just stop responding to what i've actually said and go off on a tangent. you are yet to actually poke a hole in anything. it's not facts though. it's your opinion restated as if it's gospel. and generally it's the same people. it's the same reused argument that's been around for years. and it's ridiculous. and no, you can very easily change one without the other. you bang on about being creative, yet you can't even separate those two mechanics."
8/17/2014,"lol, grow up. in the real world mate people disagree with your ideas from time to time. that doesn't automatically mean they are trolling, and the fact that you dismiss valid arguments as trolling will not get you far in life.i see, so you could give details, but you'd rather chuck out half an idea, then complain that other people aren't being creative?at the end ofthe day though, your idea boils down to ""take something that works, and replace it with a minigame, which aside from being pointless would only really work for small groups of people and would fall to pieces when you had hundreds of people in a system""."
8/17/2014,"i want to note something to you, regardless of your constant attacks, and in fact, adding no content on what happening. you act, like one of those people, no i wouldn't even say people as that stereotyping, but you seem like a person that just wants to argue for argument's sake. you my friend are the classic example of a null-bear, you want all of the reward, but none of the risk that comes with the reward, i'm sorry, but that has to change. the ability to gain reward without risk goes ageist everything this game stands for. so i provided a suggestion that would increase risk for both sides. you provided why predators wouldn't change. i clearly disagree with you on that subject, but instead of taking my disagreement with thoughtful action, you called me someone that doesn't understand how null sec works. now, i'm sure a man of... 15 years of something experience knows the ins and outs of how every single person lives their life in null sec, despite the fact that each corporation technically has different goals they wish to achieve, thus will perform and work differently from each other, will be structured differently, and have different set of rules. i myself will make no claim that i understand every single aspect of null sec, making such claim is ludicrous, and i will not believe someone when they make such claims they do. as for the i'm not poking holes in your argument, what making it so hard to respond to you is because even after poking holes into your argument, you just throw insults at me. how does one argue with insults? it pointless, and your attempts to continue to throw insults at me, are...well...relatively pointless. it's not facts? it your opinion of course, right?as for your response to, for separating the mechanics. yes, you are right, they are two different mechanics, but they kinda go hand to hand with each other. i do bang on creativity, and game design, but hey i have yet to see you listen, or you know, provide any creative suggestions. again the statement still stands, if you want to change cloak, then you have to change local, there is really nothing else to argue about with that topic.as for the real world, i think you need a reality check, yes, people will disagree with ideas, and i'm perfectly fine with that, it when people disagree with ideas, then proceed to insult said person is the part that in reality, that will most likely land you without a job, specially if you do it to your boss, or have a law suit placed on you, if you are the boss. and other questions about reality that i need to bring you up to speed with as someone that not only goes to college, but also works to help put themselves through college? oh, and finally the last thing, oh i want to chew you threw with that comment. ""were you interested in that topic, and did i make you mad when i chucked it out?"" did you even read the first part of that post? after all i did say, that making new intel tools isn't something that one can do at the drop of the hat and expect people to be nice and receptive about it. hell, look at your response to it. you didn't even look at the possibility of said new intel tool, you just scream about how it won't work if you have hundreds of people in a system, yet i never fully fleshed it out, i only provided it as an example to someone that asked ""now what?"" something to build off of, something, you didn't do. now, can you stop derailing this thread, and maybe do something useful with your time here? i don't know, maybe provide a suggestion of your own... ""mr. i know how all of null sec works so i'm the only real authority here!""you call me arrogant, yet in turn, you make yourself look just as arrogant.... it funny really."
8/17/2014,"again, i'd ask you to point out where. all i have is a different opinion to you. you seem to think i'm trolling and attacking when i don't agree with you. that's just simply not the case. i think your ideas are ill thought out, narrow minded and would be damaging to the game as a whole. that's not an attack, that's a simple statement of my opinion on the matter.except there's plenty of risk already. an interceptor is now fast enough to catch all but the most prepared of pve players, and cannot be slowed down by the usual methods. null pve is far from risk free and provides a low enough income that many people stick with low-risk highsec. and no your change wouldn't increase risk for both sides. at most, an afk cloaker would be able to be caught. an active cloaker would still be able to evade as effectively as anyone else can, but would rarely be seen coming.actually i called you out on lacks of knowledge of nullsec before that, and was right about it, since you have barely a working knowledge of null. you fly a hauler though it. that's your entire experience with null.i'll ask again though. currently a cloaker finds activity on the map, flies to the system, and d-scans the system to see if a ship is undocked and out of a pos. under your idea, the cloaker would find activity on the map, fly to a system, and d-scan the system to see if a ship is undocked and out of a pos. how is that any different? local is irrelevant to a predator right now, since it doesn't tell them if they are a feasible target or untouchable. since you'd be able to see how many people were in system, you wouldn't even lose the ability to quickly spot empty systems.then stop trying to make suggestions which would fundamentally alter nullsec at a core level. if you don't understand nullsec, you have no right to make suggestions on changing it. and let's face it, it's not just that you don't know all of nullsec, you don't understand even the basic facts about people that live in nullsec. have you even considered how your ideas would work with hundreds of players in a system? thousands? try probing out a specific ship in a populated system, and you'll understand why being able to scan people out would be less than useless in those situations. and that's just the beginning. look at all of the things people do in nullsec beyond ""fly covert ops hauler from a to b"" and it becomes much more complex. lol, except i haven't insulted you. i've questioned your knowledge and rightly so, but rather than respond to actual points you've basically just said ""nope"" and supposedly that's poking holes in things."
8/17/2014,"they don't have to go hand in hand. like at all. they are totally separate mechanics. and again, i'll make this clear. i don't want to change cloaks, i think they work well as is, which is evidences by their constant use.well you'll need to grow some thicker skin if you've been taking these responses as insults. at the end of the day, i've explained pretty clearly why i think not only your ideas but the basis of your ideas is flawed, and yet you just repeat yourself ans say ""and these are the facts"" as if that's suddenly going to make you less wrong. you need to take a step back and realistically look at the situation. you are putting forward a fundamental mechanic change which negatively affects a large group of people which you are not part of while positively affecting you, and you are refusing to even consider another viewpoint. worse still, you consider your admittedly limited knowledge to be the facts. this doesn;t even make sense to me. is this a response to me or someone else?and no, i don;t look at the possibility of a new intel tool, since there's absolutely no point in turning a working mechanic into a minigame so gankers can gank more and pve players have to do more work just to be allowed to have fun.my suggestion? leave cloaking and local alone and focus on the real problems of nullsec: sov mechanics favouring massive coalitions forming and force projection allowing groups to operate on all sides of nullsec with little effort."
8/17/2014,"clearly, your ability to read sarcasm is quite low, maybe you train it up a few levels, come back another time when you level it, to i don't know, level 1 maybe! i'm sure all you need to do spend at least an hour in the real world. that you claim i know nothing about. hahahahahahaha."
8/17/2014,"is this supposed to make some kind of sense, or is this just a standard derailment post, since you picked out the single paragraph which had nothing to do with the topic of this thread and ignored everything else?i accept your concession of defeat."

8/17/2014,"lol, then point out where they are logical fallacies. you keep saying how wrong my opinions are, yet when asked for specifics, you suddenly can't. it's because you are talking bullshit, and anyone reading this thread can see that. basically you are upset because you want to nuke nullsec, a place you don't live and occasionally visit, and someone with actual working knowledge of null, who has lived and breathed nullsec for years, has called your idea out for being badly thought out from other angles.let's face it though, if i bored you you'd not be here crying every few minutes.and the owner also statedsomething you seem unwilling to drop."
8/17/2014,"proof you didn't read the thread either, look at the front, guess what else it says. so yes, a new system is required. hey, i totally agree with him on that point. crying? about what? want me to point out some of your logical fallacies, sure. here we go! lets dive into the world of fallacies. starting with! the slippery slope fallacy! this fallacy states that if a happens, then z will happen as well! thus we must prevent a from happening! let me quote a few of your's. this is a slippery slope fallacy, because you assume that in my defense of changing how local works, without even provided any infromation, on how i migh suggest the change, that it will become tedious! that is a slipperly slope fallacy as you have no proof that if a happens (removal of local, and replaced with real, and good intel tools) that z will happen (it will be tedious!) moving on, lets pick another fallacy for you! this is a strawman fallacy! you have purposely misrepresented my argument, which through the use of break quoting to make my statement easier to attack! this is called a strawman fallacy. never once did i suggest a covops ship would be used as a tackler. lets grab another one! i want to see how many different types of fallacies you commit. this is another fallacy we like to call it the composition fallacy. we are talking about two mechanics that are not just including in null sec, but also a wide range of different other systems. however, you assume that because that one part is most strongly represented in null sec, that it applies to all of null sec, the core of null sec you will. this fallacy is also the hardest to explain, so let me take a direct quote for you. the fallacy of composition arises when one infers that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole (or even of every proper part). for example: ""this fragment of metal cannot be fractured with a hammer, therefore the machine of which it is a part cannot be fractured with a hammer."" this is clearly fallacious, because many machines can be broken apart, without any of those parts being able to be fractured.do you really want me to continue?"
8/17/2014,"lol, i can't help it if he changes his mind. i quoted him directly, go ahead and look on the previous page. that's not a slippery slope fallacy at all. do you even understand the meaning of that or did you just look at the graphic, read the wikipedia page and guess it must be a fallacy? you want to replace local with an effort based mechanic, which will have the sole purpose of generating the intel that is currently available. it won't be integrated into the existing gameplay it, and yes, it will be a tedious activity. it's not a slippery slope fallacy to point out the direct result of a given change. wrong again. i didn't misrepresent anything. i simply stated that the predator activity would not change. i also pointed out that the steps you claimed a cloaker would need to to are the steps of a tackler. wrong again! lovely! i claimed that it would fundamentally damage the whole of nullsec. at no point did i claim that nullsec would be the only part of the game affected, i am simply challenging your idea from the point of view of null sec. if a lowsec player wants to come in and represent their views, they can, but i won't, because unlike you i accept that a lowsec player knows lowsec. i know nullsec, so will represent only that view. from a nullsec perspective, your idea is terrible. go ahead though and try to convince us all you were really aiming this at lowsec. you can if you want. college kids are funny. you'll pretty much scream fallacy at everything said against you, regardless of if it contextually makes sense. and the result of your hilarious screaming is what? it doesn't suddenly make your terrible idea any better."
8/17/2014,"the post in the devblog on burner missionsmike i agree with you on the whole stable concept and raise you one noctis for those of us with an ocd type need to loot and salvage most everything. problem is moving that stable if you end up locking up your local agent is a nightmare. how many round trips should we have to do to run missions?my idea for you to broach to the devs is for a combat transport based on the orca. 25-30k m3 cargo hold for holding ammo, fittings and loot. ship maintenance bay large enough to fit 1 bs, 1 noctis, and enough space for a few frigates. no ore hold or fleet hold needed. since the ship wont be used for boosting the typical slot layout should give enough options for tank. skill bonuses should go towards speed and tank and maybe even combat ability to fight of gank attempts.to use your words, is it an extra expense? yes, but one i am willing to pay for some variety. well at least a change of scenery.the floor is now open for accolades, suggestions, criticizms"

8/18/2014,1 plex per neural remap would be expensive. i would like to be able to convert a yearly remap or a bonus remap into an item and sell it on the market. though i don't think you should be able to convert to the ones you start off with.
8/18/2014,"this proposal will cover two interconnected subjects:1. sov mechanics2. ratting participant expansionbefore i go on about sov mechanics the topic of individual system player capacity needs to be addressed.one of the main reasons sov holders have/need so many systems is that they need them if they have a larger number of players in their organization. currently, only a handful of players can be optimally supported pve wise in a single system. this causes an alliance to need quite a few systems to support their large group of players optimally. this is why this topic needs to be addressed before one can even look at changing sov mechanics.so it has been established that the number of optimally supported players per system needs to be increased, what do?as i see it there are two different options to accomplish this:1. an increase in the number of optimal anomalies in a given system.2. create a new type of anomaly that optimally expands with an increase of participants.i believe a combination of the two may be in order. first, a system may be full of optimal anomalies for individuals or small groups to complete. however, when an anomaly has too many players in it the rats in the anomaly will receive reinforcements from the other anomalies not currently in use also, the rats may call upon the local belt rats as reinforcements which would cause any faction or officer spawns to join the fight.all of this would need to be balanced out with server performance of course. perhaps the number of optimal anomalies could be viewed as the optimal player saturation point.i view this as an optimal solution to individual system player density. this may cause larger alliances to need less space to support their players.also, fun additions could be made to this system as in ways to increase rat bounty/quality by adding the option to offer various items to local rats to make them more dangerous and valuable. give them a web or ecm mod they just might use it against you and others.now that topic 2 has been addressed it is time to move on to the true topic: sov mechanics.just like the previous topic i believe a simple and robust solution is in order to change things for the better.so what is the basic breakdown of current sov mechanics?the answer to this is that current sov mechanics revolve around structures and arbitrary timers as to when confrontation will take place so as to decide ownership of a system. this allows for players to play the system by using such structures and arbitrary timers to their advantage. i believe the solution to this situation to be fairly simple. instead of sov revolving around structures it should revolve around player activity in a system. in other words, you must use a system to own it. i believe the only activity suitable to this would be ratting (pve). in the old system this would have been seen as monotonous, but given the previous topic this could be seen more as a battle than basic ratting. as for the subject of arbitrary timers the new system should be arbitrary. in the current system timers are used as waiting periods and at the very end of the waiting period hostilities can commence this just won't do for the new system.the new system will have a simple one week timer within which the two or more opposing parties may compete for a system by actively suppressing the local rat faction. when an opposing alliance wishes to compete for a system they must first enter the system and begin suppressing the local rat faction. after committing this act the competing alliance will be asked if it wishes to formally compete against the owning alliance for ownership of the system. if the competing alliance accepts then the battle begins for ownership of the system which will be determined at the end of the week long timer.the various structures in a system will keep their arbitrary timers and will be disconnected from sov mechanics altogether (you will no longer have to take the station first to take the system). upon claiming of a system by a new alliance all sov dependent structures will cease to provide their function (cyno jammers, jump bridges, etc.) and all sov upgrade timers will be reset."
8/18/2014,"this is definitely the first time this has been suggested. honest.and the issue is still the same. group a blobs and camps group b out of their system. see the problem with this idea in all the hundreds of times it's been raised is that it assumes the the current sov holders first off wouldn't be able to keep up their activity, and secondly that they would be too preoccupied with ratting in their own systems that they couldn't come beat up the little guys.if this came in, the bigger coalitions could simply rat on their own hub systems, leaving pipe systems unclaimed, and periodically go and smash out one of the little guys claims to sov in other regions. anyone trying to claim one of the unclaimed pipe systems would be committing logistical suicide by setting up an actual home there.just a hint mate: the reason this subject has been an outstanding issue for such a long time is because it's a massively complex situation with a lot of mechanics which will require consideration. if you are ever thinking about a solution and your sentence starts with ""the solution is simple..."" then you should probably just throw that idea in the bin, as it's not going to work and will be a repeat of a previous ""simple"" idea someone put forward."
8/18/2014,"what is the best way to handle a long term cloaked hostile, who may or may not be afk?possible options:1. a grid buoy: like a proximity alarm, it notices when something passes through it's energy field. should a cloaked vessel cross this threshold, an alarm goes off.(method: a penetration contact with no corresponding signature on grid)options: could have a counter that spoofs it.options: could be an energized particle field, that like a nebulae cloud, disrupts a cloak passing through it. the character trying to use it for protection would need to see the new name on overview before the hostile cloaked again.would a sacrifice be needed here? would this require a trade off?2. hunter probe: launch probe, and it begins to take ping style energy burst readings.it would eventually isolate a grid with a hostile on it, but be unable to narrow down the location further.(there is a cloaked ship there somewhere nearby, the value here is that you also know where it is not located)options: possible to have the probe emit an alarm should the cloaked ship change speed or course, or go into warp.(it may not be able to pinpoint the ship, but it can detect the more obvious changes in emissions signaling active navigation events)options: the probe may have a limited life expectancy, and require periodic replacement in order to maintain this coverage. how often, and would it need to reestablish a brand new search, are balance points.3. the hunting module, linked in my signature: this one is a mirror image for requirements based off the covops / regular cloak itself. it is intended to require equal effort to use as the cloak it seeks to locate.this module would be capable of fully hunting the cloaked ship, so would trivialize cloaking if local advertised a cloaked presence as freely as it does now.options: have it unable to pinpoint the cloaked ship, the same as the hunter probe above. this would tie up an account the same as the cloaked player does, in order to counter the cloaked player.do any of these sound promising?upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/18/2014,"with the addition of the prospect and more ore anomalies in low sec, i would like to see the trend of more ships to mine in hostile environments continue by adding a t2 miasmos. increase the power grid to where the nereus is at, so you can fit a 10mn mwd and use the mwd/cloak trick. add a high slot and remove the turret hard points and give it the ability to use 2 warfare links and room to fit them. as far as requirements and other bonuses i am not sure. if its cost were similar to other t2 industrials, around 200 million isk, then it would be much more viable in hostile space than an orca, and it would fulfill the role of boosting mining and hauling ore somewhere else."
8/18/2014,take a look at the support tug thread i posted mate. i'm sure it wouldn't be too far a cry to allow it to have a loaded industrial on board. but that'd be up to ccp.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
8/18/2014,"cool, so it looks like i am not the only one thinking about this.as for having a loaded industrial, not sure ccp would go near that. i could easily see a player packing as many fully loaded miasmos as possible and using the thing to haul ore. using the same restrictions as the orca seems more likely.just having one blinged out incursion runner in the bay will make the thing a freaking loot pinata. hence the need to give it reasonable tank and maybe light combat capability or people will never use it.now for the important question,mike, can you sell the idea?"
8/18/2014,"not to put words in mike's mouth as i can't account for what he says in closed forums, but he supports it. also, a buddy of mine who helped come up with the idea behind this ship has spoken to other members of the csm who also liked the concept. patience and faith will keep this going. if you want to help, pass the thread about it around and help garner it support.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."

8/18/2014,"while i don't think isboxer is an issue (like at all), i think ice spawns could be changed slightly to be a bit more entertaining, and a side effect would be marginally decreasing the effectiveness of large isboxer fleets. the idea would be to randomly spawn the ice belts, instead of them being located in the same system every time. the timers would remain the same just the anomaly would spawn somewhere random within the regions of that sec status that contain that type of ice. so a caldari ice in otela might be depleted and respawn in ekura (after the 4 hour timer). the amount of ice in the anomaly would vary based on security status of the system.i think that would make ice mining a little more involved, a little less predictable, would create variance in supply (due to the security status affecting the total volume), and as a side effect would make it harder for the larger multiboxers, as they would need to move around a massive fleet if they wanted to chase ice (which is not as easy as you might think)."

8/19/2014,"well i'm not going to be running quote out, but i think you underestimate how much activity a null coalition busts out. at the moment we stick to handfuls of systems, but only because we don't need to spread out. should we need to spread out, it wouldn't be difficult to do.requiring activity in a system isn't some magic bullet to resolving the issues, all it does is make it easier for people to do without having to have a confrontation. and the thing is, it's easier for a big group to stop a little group being able to run that activity that it is the other way around. the end result would be that big coalitions and rental groups have the best sov, while small groups are constantly losing and having to reacquire sov in the handful of systems they can get to.the only way to change sov that that the little guys stand a chance, is to reduce the effectiveness of force projection and make holding more sov increasingly detrimental."
8/19/2014,"there have been many good suggestions in this thread, although it is getting quite lengthy, several have taken form of proposals, this big deal with most is how to change things to where one side or the other does not get an overwhelming advantage. now, as to local as explained by ccp and chronicles. every pod pilot and ship has a becon, similar to the little black boxes on modern jets. now concord uses these to find and monitor everything from sec status to aggressive combat and respond accordingly. thus local. now in every suggestion about changing local has included adding a new form in intelligence gathering system. whether automatic or active by player. this new intel system has been tied to finding cloaked ships. the effect of local on cloaky is that you know he is there. in the submarine analogy basicly the cloak does not block the black box. thus giving intel that a pilot is in a given system, just not his location or ship type. past that there is no relation to local and this thread. as i have time i plan to go through post by post and make a summery of all the suggestions for changes to the cloaked vrs pve. i will post it here at the end of the thread and in the front. once i have done that i would hope that those interested would just discuss the pro's and con's of the suggestions, not get hung up on other mechanics and whether or not they should change.i thank everyone for their efforts and time in this thread"
8/19/2014,"i know there's a sort by last updated option, but on occasion i've had a number of current open tickets, and i noted the strange deviation from the standard threaded (or otherwise) messaging system. it should just be consistent, like bolding the lines in the ""my support tickets"" window."
8/19/2014,"well, maybe they should fix that, provide feed back, numbers man, numbers! provide proof, ectra."
8/19/2014,
8/20/2014,guilty as charged.i had no clue this thread existed when i came up with my own similar concept. there are a lot of good ideas here that even i didnt consider.
8/20/2014,"i do have a new suggestion.this is not to take away from the excellent work on the proposed four racial variants, but depending on ccp dev thinking, a single race tug might or might not be an easier sell.since it cant be ore for all the reasons already mentioned, why not soe? they are very much involved in exploration and mission running, which are some of the people who will use it. or as a secondary possibility couldnt concord feel a need to release a ship in order to help combat sansha incursions along with piracy from all the other pirate nations."
8/20/2014,"soe would not directly get involved with the production of a vessel which would be utilized to transport war ships. they are one of those entities that likes to maintain their neutrality. as for concord, they have had bad experiences with capsuleers, and would not want to run the risk of allowing movement of war ships en masse in a transport ship.personally, i believe they would be best suited to be produced by each racial faction as each race would seek to have a vessel better suited to hauling their unique ship designs and shapes. and they would most likely run with a corporation that has an industrial background that could benefit from building things for military application. i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
8/20/2014,"on a personal level, i have no issues with where you are coming from. i much prefer the four racial variants as it will not make us jump through hoops to obtain one.i made my suggestions to give the devs an option that requires far less design and coding work. 1 ship is far less work than 4 and therefore may make it easier to get them on board. once we have them on board and behind the idea, then there is nothing wrong with using lore issues to get the racial versions out of them."
8/20/2014,to save some work they could even utilize modified freighter hull models as a starting point and then tweak them to make them unique.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
8/20/2014,"introduce a new company, maby trying to wedge themselves into the ship building business in the freighter department. the support tug acts as the flagship of their product line with a couple of modified freighters to round out their sales catalog each with it's own faction bonuses. ( no idea what the other freighters would be geared toward though. )"
8/20/2014,also a good suggestion. secondary product could be jump-capable variants. or make a modular exploration platform ship which could effectively serve as a mobile command post which could improve life for wormhole dwellers or dedicated explorers.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
8/20/2014,"i understand that a coalition/alliance can put out a lot of activity in a given time. however, i don't think they will be able to effectively keep their current territories even with the activity you espouse. also, i wouldn't call 32 systems a ""handful"" and that's just the alliance you are apart of. in the new system it would be even easier to spread out as you don't have to deal with arbitrary timers anymore and you would be able to expand in a more natural fashion over time.the main issue seems to be blobing which will always be an effective strategy in terms of fighting one's enemy, but it usually is used temporarily during battle and not for prolonged periods. and yes a larger group will be able to stop a smaller group's activities and really that will always be the case given both groups have similar knowledge or skill. indeed, larger groups of active players would be able to keep a greater number of systems. also, there may be a case for changing how truesec works as for determining a system's quality. the only thing that could reduce the effectiveness of force projection would be to remove jump drives and jump bridges from the game entirely. anything else is just adding to the cost of force projection which is not a detriment to the larger coalitions due to their deeper pockets as they have stated before. as for making sov increasingly detrimental i don't think that should be the case if you are talking about just making it more advantageous to not hold sov than to do so. there wouldn't be need for sov mechanics if such was the case. now, if you are talking about making it exponentially more costly as you gain more space then that is also foolhardy. as others have already explained, if one implements such a system it is easy to get around as a sov holding entity can split itself up in order to mitigate the exponential effect. remember, the main points of activity based sov are:1. no more structure grinding for sov2. no more arbitrary timers3. blobbing no longer necessary 4. a more organic sov system for a more organic nullsec5. greater group bondage/cohesion the idea exists to make sov better and not to somehow prevent blobs.blobs will always be there if people wish to use such tactics.perhaps it will be less effective in the future, but that requires significant changes to pvp in general.i still want something at least similar to empress jamyl sarum's super weapon created by the terrans but, i could just settle for more remote aoe weapons and modules."
8/20/2014,"no, 32 systems isn't a handful, but what i mean is currently we don't use probably half of those systems at least for anything other than passing though. but only because we don;t need to. under an activity based system, holding those wouldn't be a challenge, so what would you expect to change? rental space would be kept active by renters, so it's not like we'd need to go there and grind rats. short of making the activity bar so high that it excluded small groups anyway, you simply wouldn't be able to demand enough activity to push the blobs out.so how would yoru solution resolve any of the issues people have with sov? other than not grinding structures, there seems to be no benefit to the changes, and in fact adds a new bar of entry to sov space or having to have ratters in your alliance (which not all alliances have).or reducing the range that they can operate and add time between jumps. right now you can go across the entire universe in a few minutes, so there's nothing to discourage people dominating both ends of the universe. if it took you an hour or two to get across it would encourage people to cluster up.indeed, they could split up to hold the space though that makes it more difficult to run. 1 and 2. pretty much the same thing, and while it is positive to me, as it would mean less grind ops, it would also mean that larger groups have less boring stuff to do to bully people out of their space. we'd just need to turn up ratting and ganking.3. while they wouldn't be required mechanically, they'd still be required to defeat the opposite teams blob.4. i'm not really sure about that. you're just replacing grinding a static structure with grinding red crosses.5. not really sure how the idea would change that at all."
8/20/2014,double post. i hate the eve forums.
8/20/2014,"ah, i found it, i would like to leave this here."
8/20/2014,"i suggest putting the multiple character training feature in the new eden store and having it cost 1/2 the aurum value of a plex.it doesn't make much sense to have it be ~more~ expensive for people actually paying to train 2 characters on one account. especially when having a character on a second account is both more useful and cheaper (or the same price if you are using plex).i'm new but i don't see any true downside to this. i am not paying for a second character training slot because of this fact. if it was i might pay for 1 or even both of my characters to be able to train.for anyone saying it encourages things like gankers or using alts - you can't be on both characters at the same time. it actually encourages such things by making it more monetarily sensible to have multiple accounts.on a slight aside: i played eve during retribution briefly but it was painfully inaccessible. features such as safety, the mission drop down menus, isis, tooltips on the aggress timer and certificates all show that ccp wants to make the game more accessible. we all want new blood whether it's to gank, foster, exploit or just because you're tired of everyone else's ugly mug. this would (in my opinion) be a small, but important, step to making the pricing scheme more available to new players.it is also well shown that the more someone has invested in something the less willing they are to ~stop~ investing in it and 'cut their losses'. so the more appealing and smaller charges should help new players buy further in to the game faster and make them less willing to leave.look at how successful power of 2 was.that's all! interested to hear opinions on this and sorry if my noob speak was painful."
8/20/2014,"no, for all the reasons it was no before.it's a niche product.it does not remove cheaper choices you already have available.it actually costs less initially.multiple training was never meant to replace existing choices, it is what it is and should remain the same price.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
8/20/2014,"though i feel that jita local needs some kind of control, i don<U+FFFD>t like tradeable blocklists. idea itself is good, but i have seen it already been used wrong. one day one person made list, put it on internet and traded it. first free, then she asked isks for it, which is not problem. problem was, that she put many honest traders in that list (including one of my alts) (yes yes, how many honest traders there is in local, heh, anyway) and it really harmed marketing as there was no way to correct things (as being blocked).so i believe that tradeable blocklists can become just tool to manipulate and block persons out of chat, even without their knowing.real scammers just make new character, but if you are honest, played with toon long time, it really hurts if you can<U+FFFD>t use it on local anymore.it is very easy to block. just use that and make your own decisions."
8/20/2014,"based on the tone of his response, i am willing to believe he supports this behind closed doors.i think that the ""burner mission"" concept from ccp opens the door for the idea of a ""tug"", considering one of the main complaints against burners is that most lvl4 mission runners do not always have easy access to a frigate. now that i have your link, i will happily add it to any posts i make where it would apply."
8/20/2014,
8/21/2014,"well, now i don't understand ccp anymore.people that died to a character using isbox have their ships reimbursed.so what is ccp's position on this?"
8/21/2014,[citation needed]
8/21/2014,that does not at all sound like something that would be abused to hell and back if it was even remotely true (unless we're talking about some kind of rookie protection).
8/21/2014,"sov should not be conquered by shooting npc rats. that is terrible. while i'm a huge fan of ""occupancy"" altering sov, i think it needs a balanced approach. we already have a military index (for shooting npc's) and an industrial index (for mining). use them to measure system activity. then add some additional indexes for pvp (player ships destroyed in a system) and for logistics (jumps into/out of a system). these cover the 4 basic flying in space activities, and we can add more if we want. take the average, rounded down, of all system indexes that involve flying in space, and that is the number of rf timers your ihub will have. remove owning the station from the ""taking a system"" equation. if you don't own the system, your station is vulnerable. now, we'll have lots of systems with no rf timers on their ihub, so their system can be directly attacked. reduce the online time for sbu's (5 minutes), and reduce the ehp of sov structures (to 10% of current), and suddenly system claims can be quickly destroyed if the system isn't being used. creative defining of the pvp and logistic index will prevent abuse of these indexes too. (i.e. these could be based on ships killed/jumping per hour, with a cap on how many ships destroyed and/or jumps committed in an hour.). one of the design goals should be to have pilots flying in space as much as possible. and pvp'ing should count just as much as shooting red crosses!"
8/21/2014,"i don't agree with this, i will now quote you a reason why."
8/21/2014,"i love a good story.as a writer, i can easily recognize an arbitrary backstory element, like this.i have no doubts ccp can modify the explanation for why local is not available to everyone, just concord, in regards to this quasi intel function.like concord ships, it gives too much of an advantage.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/21/2014,"yes, some of the devs have, for years in fact. yet it still doesn't change. why? because it would be commercial suicide to take a fully working feature and nuke it for one of your biggest market groups. there's simply not enough benefit to changing it to make it worthwhile. the only group that would benefit are people who like to hunt pve players in null in cloaky ships, which sorry to say is a small group which offers little in the way of income.you can say that, but it doesn't make it true. there are ways to change each without affecting the other, you just aren't willing to consider them."
8/21/2014,"i have noted your opinion many times, that you refuse to consider anything that would represent a change to the current game mechanics in this context.you state you believe that far more 'strictly farming' style pve players exist, than 'farm & fight' style pve players.but your line about 'commercial suicide to take a fully working feature and nuke it for one of your biggest market groups', that really does assume far more than we have reason to believe.to begin with, fully working? if the quoted devs are against it, and hoping to find alternatives, that makes it improvised or simply a work-a-round at best.you don't look for a replacement to a system that meets your needs exactly the way you envisioned, which i feel should be the implied meaning for fully working, in this context.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/21/2014,"mmm, the fact that you can't accept the fact that maybe it is broken, and even a dev agrees that the system needs a rework. is it a commercial suicide? well, i have to agree with nick on this. now, arn't you the one assuming a little to much? do you have proof that this will be commercial suicide, or is that.... let me quote. and again, if it was fully working feature, why does said dev agree that they want to take away the intel feature of local, they want to keep it, as a chat channel, not an intel one. once again, i think your assuming that it will only benefit hunters of pve characters, which is a blunt lie. if intel part of the channel is removed, and real tools are put in place as a replacement thus players have to do work, then those pvp players will have to do just the same, if not more work then the pve players. as with null sec, not only do you have defender advantage. you know the person that has all their gear in the system, extra fits of ships, for different hostiles that you can change right off the bat for, and far quicker then if someone that is wandering into your system will beable to do, short of bringing an entire logistic force with them, and if they have an entire logistics force with them, and i'm pretty sure they are out to do more damage then to eat one or two pve bots that are camping around in a belt. i don't know if you forgotten this, but eve online, is a pvp focused game. the more chances that pvp will happen, the better. eve the pve is technically pvp as your corp will still be competing with other alliances and corps to hold that slice of heaven, market games are pvp as you have to compete with other players, and ectra. as for consider changing one without changing the other, taking them into consideration, sure, i've seen many change suggestions by other players, most of them targeting cloaks, and in turn makes their system safer for them with them, while in turn allowing them to do less work. i'm sorry, maybe i don't agree with your mind set that ""null sec, you know the most dangerous section of space, is suppose to be safer then high sec."" i out right think this mindset should be change, null sec should be the lawless wild west, where the players are the one that must do the work to make the laws and do the work to enforce said laws. i guess we have different mind sets for each other, you may disagree that eve online is a pvp focused game, while i look at it as a pvp focused game, hell. take a look at the recent fan fest, their dream is by some point, make everything constructed and destructible to the player base."
8/22/2014,"i have no problem with the idea of changing some mechanics about, but local is simply not one of them. i don't see the benefit in taking a system which has worked for so long and stamping on it just because some gankers want easier kills, especially when it would mean a complete revamp of 20 other systems at the same time.and yes, in null, more farm pilots exist than ""farm & fight"", especially since there's very rarely anything that qualifies as a fight. people get ganked, there's no fighting involved. if local were removed and replaced with some other system, that would not change. people would simply have to do more prerequisite stuff just to get a chance to play the part of the game they like. how about we add in a pve minigame before people are allowed to online their turrets?pvp players are always happy to force pve players to have to play their way, but would flip out if the tables were turned.yes, the quoted devs are against it, and much like how some devs were for wis, and some devs were for loot spew, that doesn't mean change and it doesn't mean it's the only dev opinion. officially ccp have made no remarks about it, only a couple of devs stating their personal views. the fact of the matter is that local was designed the way it works, and it has worked that way for a long time. you can't say it's broken just because you like it. it's not a bug, it's a feature that was written into the game.i don't look for a replacement because i don't see any benefit in changing it beyond making it easier for cloakers to sneak up on people. i wouldn't consider that as a positive change."
8/22/2014,"that's because it isn't broken. you seem to misunderstand that word. you not liking a system doesn't mean it is broken. it works as it was designed to work, ergo it is not broken.as i've said above, a dev not agreeing with it does not mean it's broken, it doesn't even mean it will change. it's a dev, not the whole of ccp. there are plenty of devs that have had ideas which don't make the cut in the game. you guys claw pretty hard at the couple of quotes from years ago where lone devs have stated their opinions, yet it hasn't changed. why? because it's a bad idea.total an utter bullshit. pve players will need to know if there are hostile players around. gankers will not. the only thing a ganker will need to do is exactly what they do now, they will need to fly to a system with activity and d-scan it to see if the pilots are in space and out of pos shields, let me say again for clarity exactly like they do now.yes, the advantage of sitting in a ship incapable of fighting a pvp fit ship. and what you want to do is take away their ability to see people coming so by the time they realise they are in trouble, it's too late to react.i didn't ""forget"" that, because it's not true. eve is a sandbox game, a virtual universe. it's no more pvp focused than it is pve focused. in fact, the nosy gamer recently had a couple of blog posts about this very subject.at the end of the day, you want there to be more pvp, so you are happy to take away other people's choices to play the way they like to achieve that. some people like to pve, some like to pvp, some like a mix, all valid choices. you deciding that there's not enough pvp involved in the pve aspects of the game means less than nothing.lol. i'm not sure which part of this is the most wrong, the part where you misrepresent my views or the part where you subscribe to the moronic notion that space should be tiered from high through to null. newsflash: null is not and was not designed to be the most lawless of space. it's a place where players can own the space, and nothing more. it was not designed to turn the game into a three tiered system with highsec at the top end and null sec at the lowest.the funny thing is though, nullsec players do make the laws, and do enforce the laws in null, they just do so efficiently enough that you pee your pants and cry like a little girl about it. at the end of the day, your ideas wouldn't make the game more fun, it wouldn't add entertainment, it would simply add work. i don;t disagree that there should be more play in the system, more destruction and creation, more player control, but nuking local and giving gankers an easy time isn't going to do that."
8/22/2014,"an opinion is something that lacks a foundation of provable aspects, with which to verify it with.it is most commonly associated with statements that may be sincerely held, but lack this foundation otherwise.you can say local is not broken and should therefore remain untouched.we have no proof of this point. claiming it as a fact fails, since this test cannot establish a foundation for it.a developer does post public comments, as quoted above, citing an interest to have options to replace this with.can you give us anything solid to support your argument, beyond statements which we cannot provide a foundation for?the only statements we have from ccp either admit we have local right now, (admission of status quo is not meaningful, but observational for context), or point out they want something better.it could be equally pointed out that any game aspect for which a better replacement can be found, is therefore suspect and should be considered.your effective response that it should not be considered, needs something stronger than we are showing in favor of this.can you help us on this point?upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/22/2014,"it's your opinion, and the opinion of a developer that it should not work in the way it currently does. that does not make it broken. perhaps you need to take a look at the definition of the word. the mechanic as it is works exactly to the specification of which it was designed. you not liking that design does not mean it's broken.the only statements you have from ccp are also personal statements from those individual developers. they do not represent the view of the whole of ccp. the fact that the game still has local in it's current form is evidence enough that there's no serious push to change it within ccp.""better"" being the operative word. you want ""better"" for gankers, but that doesn't mean ""better"" all round. ccp want ""better"" for business, and spitting in the face of pve players probably isn't a wise decision in that regard.my response is that it works as is and that any change that leads off with ""remove local"" (and yes, a replacement to local leads off with that) would be detrimental to the game. it is simply too much work for very little gain and has too many negative consequences.i don't need anything stronger, since like in the past several years of a handful of gankers whining about it, it's never going to change. it would simply be too damaging to simply remove a whole segment of players to support some cloaky gankers, and you and a burnable alt aren't going to suddenly change that, even if you do try to put forward ludicrous claim that you are in fact fighting for the side of more fun pve, by making gankers lives easier."
8/22/2014,"i am sorry, lucas, but i am not representing gankers.nor am i pushing to give these types of players undue advantage, as you seem to imply.your continued claims that this will mysteriously benefit hostiles in space foreign to them, perhaps, is one of the points that would need clarification.could you please address these:how does a 'ganker' know a target is specifically present, in order to be hunted?(are you using the game map for recent activity here, or could you be implying awoxxers provide this to them?)why would the intel channel not be significant in granting local forces an advantage?(are you suggesting players do not change or adapt, and would not be expected to scout or report from gate camps?)why would a 'ganker' hot-drop a target, if they could bring in the same forces beyond scan range and surprise their target directly?(i would find it conflicting to expect a target to persistently scan, but noone else who might contribute to an intel channel)upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/22/2014,"your idea would have that effect, and you seem to disregard any idea that people other than gankers would have a say in the matter, so you don't really show this well.the exact same way they do now. they find activity, either on the map, though the api, spied info, common knowledge, sov levels, etc, then they fly to said system and run a d-scan. local is irrelevant to them now as it doesn't mean there's targets, since they could be docked, in a pos or cloaked up and afk.the intel systems as they are now as sketchy at best. there can be misinformation as well as missing information which is the biggest issue. your suggestion would make it even harder for people to gather intel so the reliability of these intel channels would go down. expecting people to have to sit on gates and constantly scan all day is utterly ludicrous. this is a game mate, even if you seem to take it way too seriously.i didn't say they would hot drop. a cloaky t3 can easily rip 99% of pve players to pieces solo."
8/22/2014,"you are assuming the ideas here would have this effect.i am still waiting for you to demonstrate this point, beyond simply making the claim itself.you make it sound so simple to reach this system, just described.are they not forced into using cloaked ships here, or some other means of bypassing a gate camp?i believe it will take significant effort to penetrate a system in sov null, where these targets exist.to ignore this as a time sink, and how this ages the intel they used to pick the system, i believe should be kept as a consideration.actually, i treat it as a game. i expect that a player cannot get out of the game more than they put into it, and you are defending something that keeps player efforts quite low.it also sounds misleading to me, suggesting things will be harder, as it implies a level of significant difficulty exists already.i mined in null quite extensively. noticing a new name appear on local's list or hearing an intel channel report was a trivial thing.being able to avoid these threats became equally trivial, as i had made no significant effort for which to reward.the difficulty in getting something, be it a bowl of soup, shelter from the storm, or protection from a threat, is what gives the thing it's value.that which took no effort, is replaced equally with no effort, and thus has no value in game.a cloaky t3 has two failings:price: these ships are expensive. replacing them is no trivial task for many, so many avoid using them for that reason.compromised: having the cloaking system in place, along with very likely the nullifier for gate camp avoidance, leaves little fitting room for both dps and tanking.in order to ""rip 99% of pve"" as effectively as you suggest, they would probably not have room for a meaningful tank.and most of all, let's not forget players adapt and change.how long do you believe it would take, for players to figure out a half billion isk cruiser was poking their alliance, before they organized a response?upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/22/2014,"lol, aka the ""nope!"" defense. you are the one that wants change, the onus is on you to prove that it wouldn't damage the player groups affected. it most certainly would make cloaking easier to do undetected, and thus would make it easier to sneak up on pve players. i don;t have to prove the current system works, since look around, the game still exists and the existing system has been in place for a long time. further, the one place local doesn't exist is the least populated area of the game.lol, gate camps. yeah, because all throughout null, people are just sitting on gates, waiting for content, right? it is trivial to fly through nullsec since gate camps are boring, so you never see them. the addition of the mobile depot has made it even easier to travel fit your ship until you are deep in enemy territory too. the removal of local would make this even easier. you seem to be under the impression that people would then be sitting on all the gates, because again you seem to not understand this is a game, not a career.that really doesn't sound like the definition of a game to me there. a career rewards effort, games are designed to entertain. game companies that can create more fun with less player effort succeed more than those that can't. now i agree that to a degree more effort can be more fun, but that isn't a rule. more effort doesn't automatically mean more fun. it's only more fun if the activity it'self is fun to do, which this would not be.and so you mined a bit. you made slightly more isk than a highsec ice miner, and for that you had to constantly be at your pc and aware of what's going on. now you want to make it so that no matter what you do, without having alts posted at every gate also being looked at 100% of the time, a savvy cloaker can sneak in and win without the pve player standing a chance. clearly, you don't understand the majority of the population of null.you are simply pushing for too much extra work with very little gain, and an incredibly one sided change, since it will be all gain on one side and all loss on the other.first off, they aren't that expensive, especially when you consider how powerful they can be.secondly, you don't need to nuke your fitting to get about, but fortunately they can be refitted at a mobile depot, so you can be nullified for travel then swap out for ganks once in space if you aren't a very good pilot. that is if you even see a gate camp which is rare, and if you can't bust through a gatecamp without being nullified, which is easy with any covops cloaker.and thirdly, it wouldn't happen. people simply don't pursue t3s in nullsec, it almost never happens. t3s that die are usually due to pilot error. if a t3 pilot doesn't want to et caught, he's not getting caught. pretty much the best way to defeat a t3 is to dock up and go afk, since he's only leaving of his own accord."

8/23/2014,"summary: the plex reseller system is still valid and valuable. coherent policies are required, now. shared oversight and a trust system is required, now. no side-deals between ccp employees and fansites/resellers. dear fellow eve player:ccp's plex system remains one of the best mechanisms for players to fund their game play. and when operated within both the letter and spirit of the rules, it's been the chief way that many community sites have been able to afford to build cool stuff for the players. in those respects, it's been a win-win for all involved.recent events clearly show what happens when the hunt for that revenue on both sides --ccp's and site owners-- goes too far. and understandably, it raises questions about the legitimacy of the entire program itself.battleclinic calls on the csm to consider the following:1. reseller promotion guidelinesthe csm together with ccp's sales, legal, and community management departments, and together with representatives from the major resellers and wholesalers of plex, should draft acceptable guidelines/rules for reseller promotions.2. csm oversight of reseller promotions, with certificationthe csm together with ccp's sales department and community manager meet to review reseller promotions on a regular basis. resellers earn a ""trusted reseller"" certification with a link to an official ccp page. resellers who comply with promotional rules will be continually re-certified, each time the csm meets.3. coherent, proactive, and community-based 3rd party revenue licensing modelthe csm together with ccp's sales, legal, marketing (branding) and community management departments together with representatives from the major resellers and wholesalers of plex and major fansite operators, should immediately convene to review the 3rd party licensing scheme that's currently underway, to determine if the standards and oversight are sufficient to prevent/deal with future controversy. and further, to require any plex reseller and fansite operator to file a business plan which describes how they will conduct promotions, sales, and marketing, which will be subject to approval by ccp and potentially the csm.4. relationships between ccp devs and fansite operators/resellersthe csm should request a review of the policy which clearly defines how ccp developers who are not part of sales, legal, or marketing may make contact with fansite operators and resellers. if one does not exist, request that it be created and reviewed. these rules should clearly articulate the type of interaction between the groups, and how communication will be monitored for adherence.finally, this:we at battleclinic have watched recent developments very closely. we believe that it's time to bring appropriate oversight to resellers and when they create deals or promotions with fansites, hold them accountable not only to contract standards, but also to community standards and expectations. because clearly, internet spaceships are serious business!chris c.""sghndubh""founder, battleclinic"

8/24/2014,"this is interesting, i never would have thought i would be compared to a ganker. hmmm lets look at something here. it has been skirted but lucas brought it to light. targets are found by map reporting, api ect. hmmm where does that information come from? .... think hard now ..... you almost have it ... yes! it comes from local local was intended from the first to be just a chat channel where you had to speak to be seen. you also have constellation and regional chats. most close them out early on in the game. both of these channels work as intel as well. a delayed response yes but can be used. all the stat reporting is why local has not gone away or been changed. ccp has a large piece of work to redo where all the collected data comes from. now back to the little black boxes. if concord stopped reporting local intel from ships. there would be no api checks, no map trends exct. oh and by the way, the map is a minimum of 30 min out of date on a good day. as a pve pilot, i would not mind seeing would be gankers not see me in local and give me a few seconds more to dock or run or fight! however to be fair, the intel we use needs to be changed. it needs improvement.i think this is we well researched and written article"
8/24/2014,"uh what? no, it doesn't. the api and map data is independent of local. no, it wasn't. that's why when they developed it, they developed it as is. it wasn't an accidental bug that they haven't been able to figure out for years, it's working the way it was designed. this argument gets raised every single time, and it never ceases to be ludicrous.that's not a local thing, so what you want is to remove all data sources for any types of intel. i assume watchlisting will go along with that too?and you wouldn't be able to react. unless you had alts on all the gates, the first time you would know a ganker was there was when he deacloaks on grid and points you. good luck evading that. right, so in your mind dscanning 10 systems takes an additional 22 minutes on top of travel time? i'd like to see the math on that. for the most part you can dscan en-route.and lol, so yes, your ideas mean that people have to run multiple accounts just to be able to pve at all. and you don't see a problem with that?i say it isn't broken because it isn't. it is working exactly as it was designed and developed to do. it is not a bug. understand that? it not working in a way you agree with does not mean it's broken.as for the qualifications, nothing i say you would believe, since everyone on the internet is an ""expert"" at some thing or another (so when i say i'm a software developer with experience with games everyone simply says ""yeah right""), but my main point of reference comes from the fact that i've lived in null for years. i've been a member of rental alliances, small gangs and now a massive coalition.one thing i know for sure is that the risk of destroying local in null would far outweigh any reasonable rewards that could be implemented without being open to abuse. so the pve moves out of null leaving null rather empty. all you have to do is cast a glance at wormhole space to see how it would work out, and it would be worse in null, since there's fixed travel paths through null (everyone knows how to get everywhere) and there's force projection to contend with too."
8/24/2014,"lol. i've explained time and again why i think your idea would be bad. you and nikk are looking at this from a single point of view, refusing to even accept that other points of view may exist. i have to ask, have you even considered what large scale combat would be like, with the complete inability to even remotely see who's got what in a combat system? seems to me like that hasn't even crossed your mind.from my point of view, after taking in all of the ideas that have been presented over the years, and looking at the state of the game over the same time period, my idea is to not change local or cloaks. they both work fine as is. your suggestion that my idea is invalid simply because i don't believe a change is required is idiotic.and nowhere did i say i'd rage quit. but you nuke null pve, and there's plenty of accounts that would become completely irrelevant.lol? like what lack of knowledge? they are extremely versatile, powerful and can refit in space. nearly every null ratting build would be annihilated by them in short order, and flown correctly they are virtually uncatchable.and yes, they would probably get into a bit of trouble against multiple pvpers, but then they get to choose who to engage, don't they? generally speaking, most ratters are at the very most in small groups in null. being supported by even a single pvp player would put your overall efficiency at less than high sec, and flying a massive group of pve players is like screaming ""hey come gank me!"" at the top of your voice. and regardless, the design decisions will need to factor around small groups at most, otherwise you're basically asking for ccp to stamp a minimum membership count on null sec. i tell you what, i'll continue to say what the **** i like wherever and whenever i want. this is a discussion forum, not an ""op decides what opinion is and isn't valid"" forum. i'm not going to just go away because you don't like that i disagree with your insane ideas to destroy nullsec by tuning it into wormhole space. i tell you what, why don't you just move to wh space? that way you get what you want and us real nullsec players can continue to play the game we like."

8/24/2014,"i think it's more an issue of having an known established standard (as stevie explained that there is) and having the csm be made aware of any 'non-standard' agreements (as covered by their nda).the csm shouldn't be dragged into daily operations, just informed.and if any of them objects they have the targets to yell at, all the to internal audit if anyone of them would feel it necessary.which btw, is quite exactly as it already is.(except when stuff is slipped behinds the backs of the community team, and thereby also the csm.)"
8/24/2014,"the questions in the op should have been answered after the somer nonsense last year. if they had been, it is unlikely the latest incident would have occurred.the questions in the op should be clarified openly to avoid similar occurrences in the future."
8/24/2014,"whilst i may be glad and agree that somer should of been / was banned, your post suggests that you are trying to past 100% of them the blame at somers feet. what i see is a failure of communication within ccp. it shows to me that there was no directive to state that all 3rd party enquires should be passed / discussed with x person / team.i hope that this has been rectified so we do not have a repeat of this latest fiasco. it is a little troubling to think after what happened the last time that nothing was put in place to ensure that issues of this nature, 3rd parties having personal / favourite contacts and getting preferential treatment, being stopped."
8/24/2014,"unfortunately this is the dark side of companies embracing social networking to talk to their customers. as long as people have ccp folk on their skype, or their personal email addresses, and those people willingly engage with players on matters they ought to channel elsewhere (as per somer and ""lisa in sales""), this is always going to be a problem. where is ccp internal affairs these days? the whole iscorps dished out to somer team on the down low got brushed under the carpet and it seems once again nothing was learnt from it. as counter intuitive as it sounds ccp needs to learn that directly engaging with third party developers is fraught with risk, especially when it's casual and informal on external channels like skype, email, etc. there shouldn't be anything being proposed or agreed upon that either party wouldn't want the community knowing about. if there is - chances are it's another somer waiting to blow up. transparency has to be foremost in all dealings, and if that means eschewing cool new ""direct access to the devs!"" tools like skype in favour of communication on forums that at least the csm can supervise, if not the community as a whole, then so be it. i realise though that's probably just a fantasy and devs and other ccp staff that have swapped skype etc details on previous pub crawls are having all kinds of ""wink nudge you didn't hear it from me but keep an eye out for x"" convos on a regular basis. at least, events like somer that seem to keep happening over and over without important lessons being learnt would suggest they are.i actually feel sorry for the people that are respecting the rules to the letter, or don't have a dev batphone, as they're the ones that seem to suffer most from it through no fault of their own."

8/25/2014,"greetings. after playing with drones and loving it i would like to propose a list of improvements to the drone ui which is vitally needed! some are simple improvements, others are suggestions or ideas.- pressing f without a target would send all drones do their respective function. combat drones would pick a target and engage, salvage drones would salvage a wreck and mining drones would mine an asteroid. by default each drone would pick a separate target unless the ""focus fire"" option is selected.- the ""focus fire"" option should be separate for each drone type: combat, ewar, salvage and mining. i want my salvage drones to pick their own separate targets instead of all going for the same closest and wasting time.- the health bars should show on unrepackaged drones in drone bay.- undamaged drones should auto-stack/repack in drone bay to avoid long lists of drones, thus reducing the size of the window.- the drone interface window should auto-resize to the list of drones displayed.- the drone decription tooltip should feature the 2-4 most important stats for drones to avoid scrolling the attributes tab and comparing (which takes so much effort).- all tooltips (not just drones) of items should feature the skills affecting said item and how much time it takes to be able to use it (or get all to 5 once usable).- all icons (not just drones) should feature the meta level of said item.- rightclicking a target should give two options: one to send a drone and another to send all drones to perform the relevant function. enemy ship = attack/ewar, friendly ship = logi, asteroid = mine, wreck = salvage.- rightclicking an overview wreck should give an option to send a/all drone(s) to salvage it.- a new hotkey to send the most damaged drone back to drone bay.- icons similar to fleet broacasts for drone deployment commands: launch drone (+shift launches all drones), cycle drone - replace this drone with another one from the bay, return all drones to bay, {interact} - name changes depending on the target (mining, salvage, attack) that performs the drone's function.- a new high-slot module that services orbiting friendly drones. each cycle services a single drone with either a full refill of shields using cap energy or a moderate armor repair using nanite repair paste.- new drones:point defence drone - orbits the ship and shoots down [some of the] incoming fire. these drones can only orbit your ship and can't be ordered to go elsewhere. i tried to maintain faction flavour: light amarr - used against light projectile and hybrid shots. it uses lasers so it's best for this. medium amarr - used against medium projectile and hybrid shots. heavy amarr - used against large projectile and hybrid shots. gallente - used against missiles. uses a railgun to shoot them down. minmatar - lasers. uses a shield around the drone to intercept and deflect shots. caldari - drones. uses rockets to destroy attacking enemy drones. tractor drone. just like the salvager - it brings whatever wreck to the player's ship.scout drone - a heavy tech 2 drone. can warp to a celestial body and give a report on the local grid based on your overview settings at the time of launch. you must warp to it and reconnect lost drone to recover it. takes 10 seconds to give the report (enterprising pirates can shoot it down before that happens).blockade drone - similar to the scout drone above - it jumps through the gate and gives a report on what's on the other side. it does not benefit from gate cloaking. again - if it gets destroyed on the other side before it gives its report you won't know if it's a single troll or a fleet.decoy drone - activate to pretend to be another ship. it is equal in every way except physical appearance and healthbars. used to fool the scanners of other players since scanning down a player's site may reveal a tengu and a catalyst when in reality it's just a catalyst with a decoy drone.tug utility craft - in the same category as a fighter or bomber so can only be used by carriers - it boosts the target ship's speed. compensates for web.ecm burst drone - an expendable drone that projects a very strong ecm burst to briefly break the enemy's targets and modules. can be used to escape a single ganker. the drone is destroyed upon use.i'm a newbro so some things might be wrong or silly, sorry in advance."

8/25/2014,"i'm suspecting the op was locked out a site that doesn't allow stealth bombers but allows the covops frigate (anathema, buzzard...) and he is therefore mad that the covops skill is not the equivalent of flying the covops frigate, a different frigate than the stealth bomber frigate.or i might be wrong and the op just has difficulty reading."
8/25/2014,"as somebody who often flies a cloaky ship looking for targets to hot drop you would think i would love local to be removed, well i wouldn't.the reason being very simple, the amount of targets would be greatly reduced and in turn the amount of hot drops which do create content will drop off dramatically. there is no getting aware from the fact that as people we are all risk adverse to some degree. when you ever you perform an activity in eve, most people will look at the risk v reward. at the moment the risk v reward for mining or ratting in null is okay, one of the reason is because of local. even if somebody cloaked comes in system you know their in system which gives you a small amount of time if you are paying attention to gtfo.for many people local gives them a sense of security which means they are more likely to rat, to mine, to do their pi, etc you remove that security blanket and you will see a dramatic drop in these activities in null because you have increased the risk massively but you have not increased the reward. how is that good for the game?as me needing local, i don't. how many people in system is irrelevant , what is relevant is how many people are in space and in what ships and where.there could be a hundred reds in system but if the majority are docked up or at a pos then a hot drop can easily be achieved. local does not give me any of that information."
8/25/2014,"ok i am unsure as to why this was not made simple enough. 1. i have never stated that local is broken.2. if you read dev blogs over the past years and csm minutes on the subject of local, working as intended. yes, 3. the same pull for the api check does feed all the sources i mentioned. over the last year and a half, ccp is making changes on the back end. 3. this thread is not about local !!!!since i think you have a hard time reading my post i will say it again. this thread is not about removing localthere are many many threads about local and intel. all that was supposed to be discussed here was how it affects cloaking and afk gameplay. we have discussed different methods of changing how we get intel. lucas kell, this is especially for you, you are grandstanding, do you want me to look that word up for you?it does not matter what our qualifications are, we both are stating an opinion. i tend to reference where i get my information and use valid sources. i have yet to see you actively reference anything.you look at the headlines of post, quoting them, maybe you should try reading them first?you are deliberately trying to derail this thread, for subject matter that while discussed here, is not what this thread is about.you are a forum lurker, that does not mean because you have lots of post and likes that you know what you are talking about. and yes, everyone can tell from just reading your post. what you know and don't know. post all you want. i for one am blocking you. therefore i will not have to waste my time with you."
8/25/2014,"you say that, but then nikk and maria refuse to accept that cloaking can be changed without local, and you yourself keep referencing local as a thing that needs to change. lets face it, this thread is about local, you just don't like that there's valid reasons to keep local. just look at prince kobol above. he's right, with local removed null would be way too empty, regardless of whether or not a handful of people found it more fun to have to have 12 alts and a bunch of button clicks to get intel. and all of those changes start with ""remove local"". you can't have an effort based local intel system without the removal of local as an intel source first.lol? you reference sources? i've seen you reference other people who share your opinion and you then restate it like it's fact, but i'm yet to see you provide anything beyond that. and let's face it, it's not something that a lot of data is around for, since we'd need to see null with the proposed system in place to see it's effect. one thing i can cite as a source is wormhole space, which is dead. that's what you want null to be, but a more dangerous version. wrong on all 3 counts. amusingly, there's several points i've mad in many of my posts which you've totally glossed over, so who isn't reading here?i simply have an opposing opinion to yours, and you can't take it.and yet, you'll still read my post (or at least parts of it). that's right, you're reading this right now."
8/25/2014,"sounds like an outstanding idea to me. my alt is an orca booster, but due to the incredible speed of interceptors nowadays, boosting anywhere outside of highsec becomes an off-grid, sit-in-your-pos bore. a t2 miasmos would be an excellent option for ninja-mining wormholes and even be useful in low/null. it would also go nicely with the prospect as a covops booster/hauler. cargo should be slightly larger than standard miasmos cargo, maybe closer to 85-90k m3 so the orca is still much better at hauling. 3 high slots, 1 for covops cloak and 2 for mining links. links should provide boosts that are about 50% that of the orca, scaling with skills and implants. would still make orca better, rorqual still the king, but have a third option with the smallest yet stealthy capabilities.sorry if i kind of directed your thread, just thought i'd throw out some options. really like your idea, surprised nobody has said anything about it in a week. maybe we're strange....also to piggyback on this, right before i read this i was thinking that a rig to add a fleet hangar to haulers might be a good idea, so they can be used as legitimate haulers instead of a jetcan cleanup machines."
8/25/2014,"pass.simply put, what you suggest would eventually allow dreads to engage interceptors and hit. with that said, this idea is horribad beyond needing more weapon types.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."

8/26/2014,"yes, i've seen that, and as i've stated before, and suppose i will again since you seem to be unable to read: a single dev stating his personal opinion does not mean that ccp as a whole wish for the mechanic to be removed.it is clearly a fact that one dev has a personal opinion on the matter. it is also a fact that its been whined about by people like you for years, and yet still exists, thus ccp obviously don't want to remove it that much. do the caps help? since you are simply repeating what you've already stated as if i'm supposed to suddenly say ""oh gosh, you must be correct! let's destroy nullsec then!"".sure, i'd like to say grow up, stop whining about working mechanics, understand that you opinions are not facts, that you have no clue what you are talking about since you don't even live in the space you want to change, and that nothing you say is going to suddenly make me decide that your insane ideas to ruin nullsec in a heartbeat are any good.the reason you think your ideas are good are firstly because you are an arrogant child that thinks he/she can't possibly be wrong, and secondly because you don't live in the space, so if it becomes uninhabitable you'll just shrug and move on. i and many other do in fact live there, so until you have a clue what people living in this space actually do, take your dumb ideas, scrawl them on a sheet of toilet paper using your own faeces and flush them.l o lyour bar on proof seems to be a little low (for yourself at least). according to you, a single screenshot of one dev stating his personal opinion is proof enough it should be removed, yet it's creation and existence for years with no change is not enough proof it shouldn't. the proof that local works is simple: immediate local already exists, and both cloaking mechanics and null sec are widely used. give me proof, categorical evidence that it will not ruin nullsec to have immediate local removed.and seriously, grow up kid. if you can't have an adult debate and actually bother to read other people's posts, then don't bother responding."
8/26/2014,"the first line is funny, considering the context that you are asking for proof of something that requires testing in live conditions to establish.now, add to that the idea that we have players complain that ""x has ruined the game"", on such a frequent basis, that it has the meme about having all their stuff as a given reply.and lucas, that second line?you are notorious for cherry picking post elements, and not just for shorter replies.many times in the past, i have seen you asking for an explanation which had already been given.can you simply give us a concrete point as an objection, rather than a blanket statement implying we have to read your mind and guess what you object to?a simple ""please no change"", posted once, is a rational reply.otherwise, please specify an objection which can be answered directly.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
8/26/2014,"yes, of course it does. which is why no proof could possibly have been provided, yet maria seems to think that enough proof has been provided, funny that.and that could be said about a lot of things. gankers, active mining and concord to name but a few. there will always be things that a constant swathe of people are going to complain about, but the fact that there are complaints means nothing in itself. with the current mechanic, i've yet to see a balanced and well thought out proposition which has been looked at from all sides and considers the existing nullsec playerbase and mechanics.immediate local as it stands does not ruin the game. the game is not currently in a state i would consider ruined, and things like force projection and sov mechanics will need to be looked at long before kicking everyone out of null so coovert gankers can thrive.am i? haven't noticed that. i mean i've noticed you whining about it, but coming from a guy that part and misquotes posts, and repeatedly fails to answer simple and direct questions, it really means nothing. perhaps you are misunderstanding. often i'll ask a question again when the original answer given was complete and utter nonsense. you and maria seem to have a small enough amount of knowledge bout the space you want to change that i wonder if you even play eve at all, let alone play in null sec, yet you think your idea is fine. i notice you totally ignored prince kobol's response to the ideas too.i've stated my objections multiple times. you are doing the exact same thing you did in a thread about this before, where you completely ignore those objections, then ask me for them again, then state that i must not have any when i refuse to repeat myself. then when i do finally list objections, you ignore them again for a few pages then ask once again.i'm not here to play forum games with children, i'm putting my point across plain and simple. your ideas are not well thought out, they are unbalanced in favour of cloakers, they do not consider force projection, they do not consider large scale fleet battles, they do not consider the effect on pve mechanics in nullsec nor the logistics of holding sov. pretty much the only thing you've considered is the point of view of a cloaked ganker and a solo pilot hunting him. the current mechanic works well, has worked for years and a change would be unnecessary and cause more damage than good."

8/27/2014,no. its a final skill required to fly a ship. covert ops allows you to fly the bombers and the scanners.but on the mission screens and guides it says covert ops frigates. im saying change the fking skill to stealth bombers so there is no more confusion
8/27/2014,this is an english speaking forum.
8/27/2014,"argues with people that provide proof to their points.provides no proof of his own.calls others children.seems like a 10 out of 10 score from me, good job. *golf claps.*"
8/27/2014,"so show me that proof. show me the proof that your ideas won;t break null sec. all you've shown is that one dev had a personal opinion that local should not be used for intel. you seem to think that if you can prove a dev posted that one twitter once, that there's no further arguments to be had. in your mind, that's categorical evidence that your ideas are sound. it would be laughable if it wasn't so sad.and i've provided proof. look around you, the game still existing is proof that the existing mechanic works.you realise people can read the previous posts, right? you realise they aren't just going to take your word for it that i'm sitting around dismissing your ideas on a whim, they are going to look back in the thread and see that all you are providing is your opinion, restated over and over.and yes, you are a child. when someone disagrees with you, you attack them, start shouting in caps, repeatedly misquote them, ignore what they are saying and restate yourself with no further clarification. that's not how an adult has a discussion. luckily for me, the csm members are unlikely to back ideas when people like you are championing them, so your response themselves help guarantee that the bad ideas you push forward will never come into fruition.edit: just as a quick thought though, exactly what is it you want me to provide proof of? you keep whining that i need proof, but proof of what? since i want nothing changed, i need provide no proof that the existing mechanic works, since it's clear as day that it does. you however do need to provide proof that your ideas wouldn't break the meta, and show that it's been considered from multiple viewpoints. i asked you once before (and you ignored the question) how the intel mechanics would work in a huge fleet battle, with thousands of people in the system for example."
8/27/2014,"honestly, i hope they do read my previous responces, and see, i've posted my proof, not once, but two times, that the dev(s) are not happy with the current system. as for if my systems working, i'm sorry, i don't recall me providing any systems that could replace local, infact. if i recall correctly, i have stated, a number of times, that such systems take time to create, then they take time to test.you are assuming that i just want to see local be snapped out of existence, yet you continue to fail to see me post about saying, instead of local that provides all the intel on the fly, i would like to see a system that instead provides a way to gain more out of it, if one is skilled enough, and puts in enough work into it, or provides less intel if they don't want to even bother familiarize with the system. i don't missquote anyone. i never have. i think you argument is breaking down as we bring more attention to your own flaws. infact, i think nick already brought attention to your own misquotes. next, shouting... right... you mean ""drawing attention"" to sections of text. it a cool little trick that one actually learns on high school level english classes, all capping certain words or sections of a sentence tends to cause the eye to snap to it. thus bringing the reader's attention to that section of that paragraph faster. can't you tell, you noticed those all caps, now didn't you?as for others being called a child. i think the only one that is being a child is you. you are the only one throwing insults around. restating what i said is a great way to reinforce what i'm saying, not only that, it also a great way: to bring the topic back at hand, you have this small habit of derailing topics. as for the proof that is required, you keep claiming that changing the system is would be commercial suicide, we require proof there, that would be a nice start.here another one, you are saying that the systems are working as intend, however i provided proof that it wasn't with this. :"
8/27/2014,"that is *a* dev, and it's a personal opinion. it's not an announcement that ccp is behind it. if ccp wanted to change it, then why have they not made any official mentions of doing so?and i'm not assuming anything. you've made your opinions clear. you want to replace local which would require removing local in it's current form. you can dress it up however you want, but that is what you want. and for what? an effort based system would be no more fun for 99% of the playerbase. the only people that would enjoy it are those who want to hunt.you've misquoted me multiple times. often, you simply truncate the quote, then go off arguing at things i haven't said.and typing in all caps isn't drawing attention. the fact tat i break your posts down piece by piece shows that i'm reading them, so no further attention is required. what is required is for you to read and understand what is being said to you in the response, which you have no interest in doing. and sure maybe capitalise some of a sentence, but i doubt people get taught to ragepost whole paragraphs of text, especially when you are capitalising something i have responded to directly (with quotes) no less than 3 times. i'll even do it again here. that is one dev, not the whole of ccp. it's his personal opinion, not the development direction of ccp. is that clear enough now, you know, with the caps? the ""i know you are so what am i"" response. you are completely incapable of accepting that your ideas might be flawed, and you respond by getting irate, ignoring posts and attacking people. i'm not even the first person in this thread to point this out to you. and funnily enough, you are posting on a disposable forum alt, so you can behave however you want safe in the knowledge you can just burn this one later. it's pathetic.so you require proof of something you know full well can't be ""proven"" without actually implementing the system.understand this: i opt for the system to remain as is. we know from being able to play the game right now that the current system works, so no further proof is required for that. you want the system to change, so the onus is on you to prove that it won't be commercial suicide, and that that majority of null players won't just unsub their ratting alt accounts and move to highsec.i don't believe any of the ideas presented so far are any good, and the main thing i question here is your experience in what you are talking about. you want to make a change which would heavily affect null, yet you don't seem to have first hand knowledge of how most of the null mechanics work. how would force projection be affected? how would large scale battles be affected? what would be the economic impact of introducing extra risk to miners who obtain the bulk of high end minerals?you seem to think that people will be willing to sit alt accounts on gates all day to fetch intel. prove that. being that i live in null, i know first hand that most people would find that unacceptable and tedious. if it's not requiring that and is just skills, then it's surely just a nerf to noobs. how would you ensure that covert ops t3s don't just become the standard pve ganker, like they are in wh space?i ran out of space for your link to the same dev from 2012 again, but i'll just reiterate what i said earlier. that's one devs personal opinion. some devs thought keeping loot spew was a good idea. some devs though keeping drone assist was a good idea. some devs even want to work on more wis mechanics. just because one dev says it does not mean it's the design direction for the game. developers on my team disagree all the time but we generally end up working in one direction, with some developers ideas not being used. you need considerably more to push your case than a nearly 2 year old conversation between a single dev and a guy who rmted all of his isk and quit."
8/27/2014,"what you're missing is that there are many cases to which it is valuable to have multi-training on 1 acct. lots of ppl make alts that have a specific role and only need to be trained so far. why pay and extra plex or $15/month from here to eternity just to keep, say, my trading alt, hauler alt, cyno alt, etc etc. its an excellent deal for folks who really think about how and when to use it."
8/27/2014,i'm reposting this in it's own thread because we're past crius and moving on to the next expansion and this is still broken. this was a good feature and shouldn't just be silently cut.
8/27/2014,"::bring back the fins::do eeet.seriously. why would you do this? stop this (overt) malfeasance targeting our beloved space tadpole. we forgive mistakes, but this is just malice... lol. really tho. bringm back. you have 48 hours. ;)"
8/27/2014,it's a bug.
8/27/2014,... and there was much rejoicing!
8/27/2014,
8/28/2014,"the real issue here is not people useing 5-10 accounts, it's guys like memory-alpha who have 300+ and actively use 50-80+ at a time to both pvp and strip every belt in a system in less then 2 hours. and an icebelt in less then 10 minuets.my alt warped into an icebelt earlier today to mine some ice, and he was sitting there with an orca 2 freighters and 40+ skiffs all bunched up in a ball.i don;t think isboxer should be banned persay, but this is getting ridiculous. when one person can control 50-100 toons ""simultaniously"", there is a severe issue.besides, we all know these massive fleets are isk farmers selling isk and rmting anyway.40+ man isboxer fleet mains i have seen:* memory-alpha - operates out of yoma* lucutus-borg - yoma, elonaya, a few otherscome csms, put your collective intelligence together and do something, enough is enough."
8/28/2014,"exactly, so there is no reason the server or client can't check to see ""how many"" accounts your computer is running and if its say more then 10, refuse to allow another one to run."
8/28/2014,"cept it so easily defeat-able, that it really laughable. so, why waste the dev time on it?"
8/28/2014,stealth bomber is a subclass of covert ops. the mission doesn't support stealth bombers (the subclass of ship) so fly a covert ops frigate. fix't. now quit shitposting.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
8/28/2014,actually it was fixed with patch#rekt
8/29/2014,"which wouldn't work, since virtualisation makes that pointless. multiboxing tools could easily bypass a client side check. they might already do so to be honest."
8/29/2014,so? stop space lawyering and do something about it. he consents to pvp every time he undocks. just imagine if those two would be doing that in a rented 0.0 space. nobody would notice and there wouldn't be any complaints from your side. so what's the problem?
8/29/2014,"we tried ganking his fleet already, he warped in 15 logies and 20 vindis then laughed in local just to prove a point.i don't have a 40 man fleet to engage him with. and you can't kill a skiff wihtout at least 3 full dps fit talos's (let alone 40+). i also don;t have 100 billion isk to blow up all the ships i would need to gank his entire fleet just once. (and successfully kill it). its a 40+ skiff/proc fleet. he also has logis and vindies on standbuy when someoen attacks him that he warps in,.your essentially telling me i should undock in a shuttle and attempt to kill a battleship. with concord on the battleships side. (since he in an npc corp.like i said earlier this problem will require several corporations if not several allainces, to simply deal with ""one single player"". because he can multibox 50-100 toons at a time.ccp mine as well introduce admin shields as available on the market, and let the carebears have orcas that will strip belts in 3 cycles and are unkillable without an entire alliance backing you.because thats basically what he is.but it's cool, as soon as they get greedy and set there eyes on nullsec (which they will because more and more of them are apearing and eventually highsec will get too crowded), and when the nullbears start loseing space and sov to 100-200 isbox fleets daily and hourly, the nullbears will demand change and lo and behold, isboxer will get banned. (or some restriction put in that disallows the controll of more then a reasonable amount ofaccounts at a time.)."
8/29/2014,"i know most of you on the csm council hate highsec and wish it were not a part of the game, that's cool, but it's pretty sad your not willing to help stop a problem until it spreads like a plague into your area of preferred space."
8/29/2014,"oh get over yourself.1. you are not that important. the guy that pays for a hundred accounts has a hundred times the influence you do, because he pays for it. he'd have the same influence whether he used isboxer, a hardware system, or old fashioned alt-tab to multibox. that is a fact of life for eve, and always will be unless ccp totally bans multiboxing in any way. don't like it, gtfo. i'm willing to bet the number of accounts run by isboxers outnumbers the number of accounts run by people who hate isboxers.2. if you're so certain a multiboxer is engaged in rmt, report them. ccp has ways to determine if someone's doing rmt, and they take it very seriously. if you've already reported a multiboxer, and they're still there after a while, you can probably bet they're not doing rmt. coming onto forums and pointing fingers just puts you into the whiney, entitlement set.3. there are thousands of systems available in eve that you can fly to. limiting yourself to the systems where the evil isboxers work is just inane.4. simply because the csm isn't bowing and scraping to your every petty demand doesn't mean they hate highsec. isboxers are in every aspect of eve. trying to guilt trip the csm is some truly prententious posturing on your part. why does it seem everyone hates highsec? this is because highsec is represented by people like you. you have no killboard, no evidence you actually play the game, yet you insist your way is the only way to play. you refuse to adapt to the game, you demand the game adapt to you./rantnote, i am neither for nor against isboxer. i tried it. didn't like it. what i am against is anyone, outside of ccp, telling anyone else that they can't play the way they want to."
8/29/2014,"well, that can be a problem, but really, that is extremly rare. do you have any idea how much hardware you need to run +50 game instances at once? my laptop can run 2, my main pc rig can run 6 without lag if i turn the graphics down. if i tried to run 20 or more acounts at the same time my rig would crash. while i can agree massive isboxing could be a problem, i would say their are mayber 10-12 players doing it out of the 600,000 or so active accounts. not really a big problem. the average isboxer only runs 10-15 accounts. i personally run 4 accounts, but not with isboxer, i do it all manually. but still, i really don't see how the problem is big enough to justify the resources that would be required to track and stop it. isboxer is basically a keyboard emulator that copies actions across multiple clients. there is no way to prove if a client is using isboxer. except for maybe scaning the machine running the client for known third party programs. but even then, the programers responsible for creating those programs could find a way around it. besides to do so would require ccp to add a clause to the eula allowing them to scan clients computers activities outside of the eve client. that would likely get eve banned by most large countries due to privacy violations. it just can not be done, at least not legally."
8/29/2014,"i like all of this, but i think you are missing one key part (and let me know if i simply missed it)""inactivity in a system"" should degrade the system back to non-sov, after that same 5 day period (or the level below whatever it is currently at if that same levels requirements are not met every 5 day period). if the sov requirements are not met continuously every single 5 day period.otherwise you end up with the same problem of afk empires simply doing what is needed to get sov 1 in a system and then simply ignoring it.there needs to be a severe threat of losing your system if you are not ""useing it"". keeping sov should be a lot of work in every aspect. currently it's just a joke about who can pay the most isk to the nether gods of ccp."
8/29/2014,"i mentioned in the 1st or 2nd post that the system level is based off of a 5-day rolling average of system points gained (by activity) compared to the max possible number of points that the system could support. the max number of points is determined by what level-dependent structures are placed that serve to increase the available content producing opportunities (either increasing the value of each opportunity, or the total number of opportunities). system levels are lost/gained by passing certain thresholds of the points gained/points available ratio.quick example: (point values are theoretical...too early for math and cross referencing my other posts!!!)system level 4, total available points: 2mif the system dwellers gain 1.5m points on average for the 5 day rolling period they keep their sov levelif the system dwellers gain 1.8m points on average for the 5 day rolling period they are eligible to increase system levelif the system dwellers gain only 1m points on average for the 5 day rolling period, they lose a system level, and the structures that were placed that depend on the system level are offlined (the workers go on strike?).new ""downgraded"" system:system level 3, total available points (because structures were forced offline) is now 1.25m points.if the dwellers can maintain their 1m points per day average, then they will keep level 3. if activity continues to decrease, then each new day would have a decreased activity/available ratio, causing either maintenance or loss of level. without doing some spreadsheet calculations, this would cause system level to drop (possibly) daily over the course of 5 to 10 days (depending on how steep the stop in activity is) until the system level is 0 and the system is back to neutral. this also gives the defender the ability to resist an activity siege. as long as activity level is maintained to a necessary minimum, the system level won't decrease, or will require a bigger investment by the attacker to steal system points.hope this explains things a bit. thanks for the bump!ced"
8/29/2014,"i like the idea's, but it seems to me a little over complicated, and would still allow blob warfare to domitate. personally i do not see any way of addressing blob, or numbers win, issue we currenty have in null. this is basically how civilization works. the most power enities win, those looking for security join those enities, making them even bigger and more powerful. we see this even in the real world. in fact if it wasn't for human morality, and human rights affecting the powers that be, it would continue until there was only one super powerful entity ruling the entire world. we do not have those things holding us back in a game. we are free to be as evil or imoral as we wish, with no morality or fear of punishment. eve is a game, not the real world. people play to have fun, world peace thru dominace is not a good thing in a game based on warfare and fighting. such a state is not fun in a pvp centric game. sov definently needs a rework, but i believe smaller steps addressing one issue at a time would work better. a massive single change like described in to op would hit current sov holding enties like a huricane causing more destruction and collapse than repair. that could be a good thing, or it could be the end of eve as players quit after seeing all they worked for collapse. however, if done in small steps, over several updates, allowing players to adapt to each change before getting hit by the next would be the best course of action. the most crucial step, at least in my opinion is the issue of all the sov held space that is not used. that is starting to change on its own, with more power blocks now renting out unused space. but this does nothing to curb the power of those coalitions, and does not take the space out of their control. why are they able to hold space they do not use in the first place? the op's idea could solve this, but a much simpler system could be implemented much easier. based on a system we already have. i believe the last sov rework was a step in the right direction, it just needs a few more iterations. it is like the changes were never finished. we already have a system where indexes degrade in low activity systems. but they degrade down to 1, and that is all, sov is still held. what if indexes continued to degrade right to nothing. and once all indexes reached zero, all sov structures would automatically offline and sov would be lost. these structures would still need to be destryed before new ones could be anchored. which brings me to the next point. i beleive all structures in the game should have most of their ehp in sheilds, not in structure. and when they go offline shields should drop to zero. how is a sheild maintained without power? it shouldn't if you own a structure, it is your job to keep it online, if you don't, it should not be as hard to destroy as an online structure. this goes for all anchored structures, including starbases. if you let your structures go offline, they should not auto unanchore, or be available to steal, at least not without significant effort, but they should be way easier to destroy that when they are online. with these changes sov holding enties would automatically lose systems they do not use. as enties grow and become more powerful, they will push to claim better systems. as they do so, older less valuable system will fall into disuse, and eventually sov will be droped. sov entities will remain the size needed to sustain their population, not the size they can actively defend with their blob fleet. the boarders may constanly move as better systems are claimed and useless systems are droped, but the size, or number of systems they hold will be dependant on their member based, and activity. as new enities enter null sec, claiming these abandoned systems, they will slowly grow in size and power, and move into better systems, they will die off, or they will be absobed by larger groups. either way those entry level systems will be opened up for new groups to claim. it is very true that this would not elinimate the ability of coalitions to dominate, these new small enities could be forced to either join a coalition, or become targets for their pvp roams. however, with this system you can not simply join a coalition, and go use their space leting your home systems go idle. if you do so sov will be lost. new groups joining the coalition are not going to be happy staying in these crap systems while their brothers are making 5 times as much in their better systems. if they suport to coalition, they will want to be rewarded with better space. it wil be much more difficult for coalitions to keep underlings happy. this will cause a great amount of instability in those coalitions. if you want to live an rat in the good systems, you will have to earn member ship into the alliance that holds them, not just be in the same coalition. this will likely cause the size of corportations and alliances in null sec to grow, and the popularity of coalitions to fall. but no matter how the ball bounces, groups will not be able to hold sov in systems they do not use. two very simple fixes to make this happen. -allow sov to degrade to the point of sov ihubs and tcu's going offline on their own. -and slightly revamp structures so sheilds or at least resists, are gone when the structure is offline. making structure bashing of abandoned strutures much easier. this will not sovle near all the problems with nul sec sov, but would be a very big step in the right direction, at least in my opinion."
8/29/2014,"yes, that is possible, but to ""hold these system at a minimum level to stop others using it"" under the op's idea, would require your members to participate in these activities in a lower class system, when they could be doing the same, with higher rewards in their home system. who is going to want to rat, or mine, or run a pos in enemy teritory just to slow their claim to sov? not when they can make much more doing those activities at home.not to mention, spending time preventing smaller groups from claiming sov, takes time away from the activities needed to upgrade your own systems. this system th op describes, your activity in you own systems is what keeps those systems at a level that suports your member base. if your members are off pesering other smaller groups, your home systems will suffer due to the drop in activity there. what you say would be possible, but you would be hurting your own system, by not getting point their, while you are off preventing someone else from gaining points in their home system. these smaller groups trying to claim systems you have not bothered with will generate a lot of smaller scale pvp, which is one thing current null sec is really lacking. even if they get stomped out, at least the targets will be there. as long as you do not stomp to hard, it would bring small scale pvp in large volumes, back to sov null sec."
8/29/2014,"thanks for putting words to the concept!!! this is a good way of explaining the idea behind my proposal. stay at home and make isk in your own systems, or spend time and resources harassing/attacking another group! sounds like content to me :)"
8/29/2014,"@ bugsy:my intention with this idea isn't to eliminate blobs, instead it minimizes the need for a blob. if you want to harass a smaller group with your thousand-man blob, go for it. unless they also have their system upgraded to support their own equal si"
8/29/2014,"i am all for this. eve is too small as it is. i should see vast swaths of unclaimed space. what i see is 100% claimed and occupied 0.0 space.which is well.... completely unrealistic. space is huge. not a tiny finite area of a few thousand systems.""but this might cause an issue with memory and people on lower end computers!""so? eve is a game you shouldn't be playing without a modern rig anyway. and if at some point a player has to dedicate an entire 1tb hdd to just houseing and running eve, so be it. if it fixes the issues and makes space as big as it should be i am aok with that.0.0 should be so vast that when you go deep enough your in a wilderness of space so far away from everything you feel tiny, alone and vulnerable. and so large that the 10,000 man alliance that owns 2000 systems, is a particle of dust compared to the rest of the eve universe...."
8/29/2014,"many, if not most null sec residents make their persoanl isk from ratting. who is going to want to give up ratting in the good systems and go to a system several jumps away, where they will make significantly less isk for their time? it is just not going to happen. sure for a large alliance to hold 35-40 systems will not be to much of a challenge, but some currently hold hundreds, maybe not by the main alliance, but through holding and renters alliances. those things could become a thing of the past. could a large alliance with 1000's of members hold hundreds of systems? sure they could, at least it would be possible. but then some members would have to live in those low value systems to maintain the sov there. and speading out activity like that would make it very dificult to max out core systems. these extra systems can be held by renter corps, belonging to a holding alliance, much like is being done now, but would require a lot more organisation, and the renters would be fully responsible for maintaining their own sov, with less control by their overloards. basically they would just be paying a protection fee, old gangster style, in order to be permitted to live their. with much less control or infocement. the point is, occupancy sov would require a lot more work to hold onto large blocks of systems than the current system. while it is completly possible to do so, nobody is going to put in the effort to hold more systems than they need. especially if more benifit could be gained by keeping core systems at a higher level. someone in another thread commented that sov does not need to be held in these systems, they can simply be patrolled, and forcibly be kept empty. again, that is completely possible. however, the time and effort to do so would take away from the activity in home systems that could contribute to higher levels making the home systems even better. groups will have to choose between focusing on improving their home space through focused activity, or sacrificing some of that activity to spread out their empire to control other systems, they maybe do not even need to control. eventually holding extra space, they do not use, will become to tedious to bother. there are a lot of good, and some great ideas going around. but whatever is done, the only chance of sucess is not to try and force groups to hold less space through restrictive mechanics, but to implement a change to game mechanics that will make it more profitable to focus on maxing out fewer system, than holding more systems at a lower level. think of this. if we could have the same power blocks, and large powerful alliances we have now, but say 4-5 systems(a constellation) with enough activity, could be upgraded to suport 2500 members. at max activity level, available upgrades could easily suport 500 members in a single system. groups like gsf with +12,000 members would need only 20-30 systems to suport all members at maximum income. holding anymore would mean they would not have enough activity to keep them all at max level. they would have the option to spead out, but would make far more isk staying grouped tightly together maintaining max levels in their systems. at the same time small groups of 50-100 members, could hold a sov system, but would never be able to produce enough activity to max out even a single system, encouraging these players to form into larger groups, to gain the advantages provided by higher teired systems. for this to work a max level system would have to make it possible for players living their to make significantly more isk/hr than living in a system even one teir lower. plus the alliance would have the added advantage of all available pilots being only a few jumps from each other making home defense very easy. and mobilizing for an assult even easier. no more planing 3 days ahead to move assets to a deployment system. home base could be your deployment system. maintaining a max level system would give members the maximum possible income on an isk/hr basis. the more they spread out, the less valuable their systems become, as their member base is only capable of so much activity, spreading out would result in less isk per hour for that activity. upgraded systems would have to be able to suport the number of players required to maintain the activity level at the maximum without putting to much load on the server nodes. basically the balance of how many members are required to maintain the maximum level would be completely dependant on what activity level the nodes could handle without the threat of tidi kicking in. this would need to be combined with a bottom up finacial suport system for the alliances. this could be as simple as an alliance level tax. this would be in addition to corp taxes. say you could easily make 100m per hour ratting in a fully upgraded system, you pay 1-10% to your corp, and an additional 1-5% to the alliance. perhaps add the tax to other things as well. if you reprocess anything, you pay a fee for the reprocessing, it would no longer be free. in high sec the fee would be 10% of the value of the ore being reprocessed. in sov null sec, the tax would be set by the sov holding alliance. say this activity index was a 1-5 like we currently have for each activity. a truly maxed system, would need all indexes maintained at 5. say that would take, on average, 500 members living there to maintain easily, or whatever number the servers could handle without tidi kicking in. the available content would have to be enough to suport those members, and would have to provide them enough of an increased income to make players want to live in maxed out systems."
8/29/2014,"i don't beleive making it detrimental is the answer. but making it more profitable to focus activity on maxing out fewer systems would allow members to make far more isk/hr holding less systems, than spreading activity across more systems than they need."
8/29/2014,"this is a coment i have a big problem with.you are in null sec, i.e. dangerous space. the threat of being jumped, or dropped on is, and should be there at all times. as far as i am concerned, the need for a cyno alt to be able to move a capital ship should be removed. let capitals jump to bookmarks, with no need for a cyno at all. this would be balanced by the fact that you are jumping blind, unless you have an alt or freind at the destination. cloaked campers are not doing anything to you. you say any smart player will not be active in a system where there is a claoked camper. i say, that does not make you smart, it makes you scared. as soon as you go into low, null, or w-space you are consenting to pvp. why should you be safe in sov null just because you are ratting or mining. you are in a pvp area, and are subject to the dangers of unexpected pvp. you don't like it, move back to high sec. that being said, i do agree that afk cloaking maybe should be addressed. not cloaked camping, if a player wants to actively play a character cloaked, sitting in a system just watching, that is a perfectly acceptable tactic. phsycological warfare has its place in eve. however, back to the true afk cloaky camper. all that is needed is a mechanic that prevents players from remaining cloaked while afk. i would say remove the ability for cloaks to autocycle. you could make the cloak cycle longer, say up to 5 minutes if needed. but you click it, it cycles once and shuts off. perhaps a 5-10 second buffer after the cycle completes before the cloak actually drops. allowing an atk player to reactivate it for another cycle before the cloak drops. this i believe would acomplish what is needed. any afk cloaker will decloak after one cycle. eliminating the ability to set your character in a system cloaked up, and go off to work, or bed, while still affecting your enimies. even players semi afk would be affected as it is very easy to not alt/tab back in time to restart the cloak. you get busty, and just forget, or fail to realize the timer is up. this would allow for even semi afk players to have a chance of getting caught. the only truly safe cloaky camper would be one totally atk, and that would be far to boring for most players. but would allow for this phsycological warfare to still be used if desired, just not while afk."
8/29/2014,"it wont matter anyway, have you looked at the blueprints? they decreased ineral income through refineing nerfs, then double and trippled material costs for tech 2 ships.then to top it off they stealth modified the bonuses so they do not apply to planetary components required to build things like.. pos's. so not matter how high your me is on the print the material cost will always be the same. (i know i have a 100 me bpo for a caldari pos tower, and it's material costs are the same as a 0 me one at perfect industry skills on my indy toon).they essentially just insured the your about to pay through the nose in a few months for pos towers and anything that even remotely uses planetary commodities."
8/29/2014,"that really doesn't have anything to do with the issue i'm posting about, but thank you for the reply."
8/29/2014,"uh, as far as i'm aware, it's still in there. it's just rolled into the system cost index."
8/29/2014,"really? because that doesn't match what i've seen. there's a restriction that you can't drop something below 1 unit per run for a material, but that's it.do you have screenshots?"
8/29/2014,they were given as 2 different modifiers to job cost in the two blogs i linked and again in the blog about 3rd party api endpoints in crius.
8/29/2014,and here is the api info on the way it should be calculated. spreadsheet this out and compare it to in-game numbers and you'll find a giant discrepancy where facility bonuses should be.
8/30/2014,hi everybody. just hoping to see more people express their opinion on this.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
8/30/2014,"this is good. and if you have multiple or a group, then split the monitor.also some decorum would be nice. bring able to personalize one's quarters. medal case, potted plants, et cetera.and why not let us walk around our hangar?give us something to increase immersion. an office or conference room for corporations and alliances!i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
8/30/2014,"i have been thinking...some points going forward:1. you must realize that 80% to 90% of all industry is done in highsec, including mining.2. people do not want to mine in lowsec, or they would. this is mostly due to the fact that mining ships are ""defensless"". and mining in low sec is a guaranteed death sentence (which falls on you pvpers). so why would a miner do it? they wouldn't.3. the eve economy is fueled by highsec miners and industrialists. ccp has stated this on numerous occasions. without the hoighsec ""carebears"". the economy would collapse. you would be paying 1 billion isk for a single round of ammo.only 5% - 20% of minerals, ships, and goods on the market come from 0.0 and lowsec, according to ccps manufacturing, marketing and industry charts.4. pvp emergent game-play is the real factor in a miners or industrialists decision not to go to low or null.lets look at number 1:ccp has already confirmed that the vast majority of industry in eve takes place in highsec. the goal of the latest industrial patches was to attempt to shift the focus to null and lowsec, but failed miserably because industry in and of itself, is not the issue.the issue is the emergent game-play itself. specifically, the pvpers. and the way industry happens from the back end ie: mining.a miner must get into a defenseless ship, in order to have a mineral income sufficient to supply a markets demands for minerals, which are then used to build ships, ammo etc with. an individual with any intelligence is not going to take said ship into a sector of space where the chance of loosing it is almost 100%. even if you offered ore that was worth 1 billion isk a unit that an npc station would buy. very few would take you up on it.why?because retrospectively, pvpers would 100% camp these materials and gank every single miner who came within 1 au of it. making the addition, pointless. (where the focus is concerned,( ""getting miners out of highsec"").---so reward, has nothing to do with how one should approach this issue. because the reward in this case to a miner, is never worth the risk, due to the multiplier of emergent pvp game-play.this is why the vast majority of everything is made in an area of space that has a worthwhile risk (the occasional suicide gank) rather then in an area of space where the risk is: ""you will die almost 100% of the time"".the other reason is because mining takes ""time"".. a long time.... to gather sufficient minerals to build even a single ship, your talking hours, if not days. (depending). null, and low do not offer the ""time"" availability to do this. sure you can ninja mine, but it will take you 10x the amount of time to gather the same minerals the high-sec miner does.why? again because of ""emergent"" pvp game-paly. miners make easy to kill and juicy targets. pvpers want easy to kill and juicy targets (for the most part). if this was not the case, there would be a lot less dead miners.point 2:people do not mine in low or null (usually) because it is time consuming, and too risky. in lowsec combat and pvp is part of survival, so it is asinine to expect someone to go to said space, knowing they have no ability to defend themselves in the ship ""required"" to mine ore in the vast quantities needed to supply a stable market. give miners ships with fat tanks and the ability to pump out dps, and miners will start going into low and null to mine. but then many pvpers would have an issue with this, because then it would be a risk to them to try and kill them. it is blatantly clear that many pvpers only enjoy pvp when they are not at risk.for example look at the old battle hulk, used by many miners in lowsec and null once it was discovered that it could kill a battle-cruiser if fitted properly. pvpers sent an outrage of 1000's of posts to the forums ""demanding ccp nerf the hulk so it couldn't kill them anymore and they could gank in peace again""....i mean really people..... really.... either you want miners in low and null or you don't... which is it? i think you just want easy kills.point 3the economy in eve is a fluid monstrosity, fueled by players from everywhere right?.... wrong.80% of everything created, built or made in eve, is exported from highsec. ccp already confirmed this, and again was the reason for some of the industrial changes which those of us who are actual industrialist and deal witht he eve economy, marketing and such things every day, told ccp would not solve the issue, we even told them what issues it would create, and yet ccp went ahead with it. lo and behold...we told you so never says it enough.what did we tell ccp?* it would not make miners and industrialists move because industry was not at the core the issue stopping them from going to null and low to mine and do such.* it would cause prices to skyrocket (which it has).* pvpers would still ***** about how highsec miners need to get into 0.0 and lowsec. (which they do f).> continued"
8/30/2014,"* ccp was told that the main core issue had to do with the way eve handled emergent pvp gameplay. and that industry and mining did not mesh enough to allow industrial/pvp emergent game-play to compensate for the difference.ie: defenseless mining vessels.point 4:the real issue is emergent pvp gameplay.well what is this? compared to industry it is when ccp gives industry a boost by placeing better refining rates or materials in more riskier space as a motivation for miners to mine there, and pvpers also take advantage of said changes in order to gank gank gank.which has the effect of making all of ccps work.... pointless and a waste of time since no miner will care that he or she can get those minerals because it's not worth the risk, since they can;t defend themselves.but eve is an mmo!!! work together.it's a good idea. however 0.0 and lowsec alliances would rather kill miners then protect them. which again while part of eve makes the changes pointless since miners and industrialists will not take advantage of the changes due to such.bottom line:if the player base of eve want miners to go into lowsec, or null. you need to change your own behavior to encourage them to do so. atempting to create game mechanics which force miners into low and null will not work, all you will do is cause your ships to cost billions of isk per frigate.what you do not seem to understand is that industrialists don't care what minerals are available where. we can buy every thing we need. and you those in low and 0.0 must accept our prices for such. and you also must accept our prices on the market if you choose to ""buy"" anything.so all these changes do is increase our prices for your items, they have absolutely no other effect.because industry.. is not the issue. pvp is.that being said, give miners the ability to defend themselves, and they will move to null and low."
8/30/2014,"and your post shows you're not used to doing that.1. because it is cheaper to build in highsec. this is the only reason, and had you a grasp on how the economy of null works, you would know this.2. there is nothing in lowsec you cannot get in highsec or null a lot safer. this is not the fault of the pvpers, this is because there's nothing special to mine in lowsec. the day ccp adds something to lowsec that can't be mined anywhere else, people will start mining there.3 and 4. these should not have been two seperate points as 4 is the point while 3 is just supportive. first off, lowsec and null are two completely different entities, which you would know had you ever left highsec. i've already covered why there isn't more mining in lowsec.the reason there isn't more mining in null is really the fault of the coalitions. do not take this as a grrr goons post. try joining any of the major sov holding alliances as an industrialist and you'll know what i mean. the main coalitions already have their industrial base, and don't want to let anyone else in. if you want to mine in null, you're relegated to the renter corps, which live in the poor systems that are constantly patrolled by neuts and reds that know the sov holders don't care about their renters.oh, about you little comment about less dead miners, here's some numbers for you:hulk: 10mackinaw: 20skiff: 4covetor: 14retriever: 62procurer: 6total: 116this is the number of mining barges and exhumers zkill has listed as killed in highsec in the 24 hour period of august 29, 2014. this is a bit under half the total number of mining barges and exhumers killed total in the same time period, and a minute fraction of the total kills.you've been doing a lot of posting lately trying to get every method of gameplay you don't like banned. unfortunatly for you, the more you post, the more it becomes obvious you really don't know what you're talking about."
8/30/2014,"1. um... no it isn't. corps and alliances in null do not pay any taxes or anything at all (or much) for building and can tax minerals and lines themselves. it is actually profitable to build in 0.0, or to simply ""host a station"" which allows such for others. i should know my mains corp owns several and makes billions a month simply by owning them.2. actually, you can not mine abc ores in highsec, not even from the anomalies. however you can in lowsec, and with the new changes coming (if you keep up with these things), you'd know lowsec ores are about to be super buffed.people still wont mine in lowsec however, again because pvpers will camp the systems waiting for this. (which is fine), and miners are not going to take defenseless mining vessels into a slaughter, despite what many pvpers think about carebears, they are not stupid.so my point about emergent pvp stands here as valid.3. i am aware the few industrial individuals in some of the sov ""super"" alliances are perfectly safe, however this thread is not about the rare few, but about the vast majority that do not.4. i have not posted a single thread asking for content to be removed or banned. isboxer is not ccp content. and therefore does not count. it is a 3rd party program which enables a single person to control 100's of accounts at once. which a single individual would not be able to do at all without it (logistically or feasibly), and thus since it is artificially emulated is therefore in my opinion : botting. which is against the eula which clearly states that any action which could not be facilitated by a single person at the keyboard without using an artificial program is considered by the eula, botting. and banable."
8/30/2014,"from that rant, it's quite obvious you haven't.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
8/30/2014,you make a lot of assumptions that are (laughably) wrong.
8/30/2014,"1. now we get to the 'my main' post. i call bulls**t on this. post on your main, i do. i've lived in null, both in sov holding alliances and in renter corps, something you have no experience in from the way you post. then again, you also claim to be an it guy...2. train another level in reading comprehension. note the phrase i used, ""..you cannot get in highsec or null a lot safer."" again, there's nothing you can mine in lowsec that you can't get elsewhere. this supposed emergent pvp of your's would not stop the intelligent miners if there was anything worth mining in lowsec. as for your claim lowsec ores are about to get buffed, prove it. i read the devblogs and have seen nothing to support your claim.3. the vast majority that do not mine in null do so by choice, wether misinformed on the danger, because they don't want to be in renter corps, or simply don't want to live in null. it is still their choice and generally not the fault of the big scary pvpers.4. since you want to bring in your ban-isboxer thread, know this. it is your opinion isboxing is botting. since this is ccp's game, it is their opinion that matters, not your's."
8/30/2014,"my point with that post is that if you give mining ships the ability to defend themselves, more miners will participate in the whole null/lowsec areas.bonuses to defense are not enough, it does no good to simply ""survive"" until more people show up. they need to be able to neutralize their attacker so they can either warp out or continue mining.i do not see an issue with that. in fact it accomplishes and fixes some of the issues so many complain about. and hey the pvpers should be happy, as care-bears will finally be pvping.. i mean really it's win win for everyone.oh, and i am not allowed to post on my main. it's alliance/corp policy. there are obvious reasons for this, both strategic, and political.again, on isboxer, according to the eulas definition of botting, it is exactly that, and ccp wrote the eula which defines very clearly what botting is. yes it is ccp's decision whether to enforce it, or not. but it is, what it is."
8/30/2014,"armed mining barges have already been covered in f&i to death, so no, for all the same reasons as previously posted in those threads.the reason your alliance doesn't let your supposed main post on forums is because they don't want to be associated with shiptoasts like your's. your alliance probably also has a rule saying you can't post with alts either, most with that rule do.lastly, it's ccp's allows isboxer because what it does can be done with pure hardware, this was demonstrated to get isboxer unbanned in the first place. bet you didn't know isboxer was banned from eve at one time. had you read that entire thread, you would know this. your whiney examples are the oddities, not the norm for isboxer users. but that's another thread, and since alll of this thread has already been covered in other threads, time for it to be locked."
8/30/2014,"isboxer is software, not hardware. there is no chip you plug into your computer that lets you multibox. its a program that automatically launches your accounts through inner space of which you can log every single one of them in simultaneously. and then control all of then simultaneously (meaning with one pw entry of the keyboard or mouse) also with a single click.controlling more then one account or character at a time with a single click or press of the keyboard is the very definition of botting, according to the eula. the eula clearly states all accounts and characters must be controlled independently and individually.any simultaneous control of multiple characters through non-independent methods is botting."
8/30/2014,"but back on topic, please enlighten me as to why armed mining barges are a bad idea? to much of a risk to the ganker? poor pvp pilot afraid to lose his ship.... to a carebear?"
8/30/2014,"[procurer, lol-tastic]drone damage amplifier iidamage control iimedium shield extender iiadaptive invulnerability field iiwarp scrambler iistasis webifier iistrip miner imedium anti-em screen reinforcer imedium core defense field extender imedium core defense field extender ihobgoblin ii x5hornet ec-300 x5i use this in low-sec for ""bait mining"" (which often turns into just ""mining"" because few people want to engage this ship by themselves).now granted... the procurer has a narrow engagement envelope, but it works way better than it should for a ship that is not designed for combat. get 2 or three of these working together and you can give most small gang pvpers a run for their money. get a logi ship as back-up and you can actually hold the field pretty well against spectacular odds.also... people do mine in low-sec. you just don't see them often. which is rather the point. because if they are seen then people will start hunting for them.but the real reason not many people mine in low-sec is because it requires real effort and vigilance. in high and null-sec space you can semi-afk while mining and still remain relatively safe."
8/30/2014,"because it is already armed. every mining ship has a drone bay, what more do you want for a mining ship? a skiff can tank so much that some people use it to gank gankers, several kills on the killboards to support this, many without concord being involved. really, this thread is nothing more than a now unstealthed nerf ganking thread.by the way, a pvper is never afraid to lose his ship. if he was, he wouldn't be a pvper."
8/30/2014,"bugsy, while we can agree to disagree on one or two points, you will find that we have many thoughts in common. however there should also be a mechanic to hunt active targets as well. it should be fair, but both parties should have an equal base chance of success. now as too jumping to bookmarks, that would be severely overpowered. i am sure there are threads on that specific issue. your idea of removing auto cycle of cloaks is sound, but has issues as well.good points, please keep posted to this thread as i am working on a summary of ideas to address this and would value your input.thanks"
8/30/2014,"and it still doesn't solve the problem on why cloakers go afk in systems in the first place, specially if they are pvp cloakers, and that because targets tend to run away as soon as they land on the gate... so, yah...many times, they have to be afk for days to get that target to come back, so that they can get a kill."
8/30/2014,"ahh another person who would have her prey sit with all modules off and say ""kill me please"" so you would have me believe that your answer to afk cloaking is that everything undocked is instantly scrammed and webbed until such time as you choose to open fire?"
8/30/2014,"this proposal would eliminate overview clutter if a lot of ships that are currently not piloted are in your overview, this can be the case in wh posses as well as when doing probe scans in a system, you can eliminate un piloted ships from showing up and knowing how many hostile pilots are active or at the very least, logged in. this could be very important for whs, since local is does not show anyone."
8/31/2014,if anything the csm should pressure ccp to encourage more people to use isboxer.
8/31/2014,moar ships!i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
8/31/2014,"saying a mining barge is armed is laughable. they have enough dps to kill highsec rats, maybe lowsec rats (depending on system sec status) unless your willing to sacrifice your needed mineral income for about 30 more dps and it's still no mach for most gankers.a ganking frigate can do about 500-700 dpsa mining vessal (well go with a skiff) can do about 150 tops.it's not even comparable, pvp wise. if you flew one and tried to kill someone with it you'd know what your saying just isn't true. the skiff is the only mining vessel even remotely close to being able to hold it's own against frigates. and like that other guy posted it's window of usefulness is slim, and you have to severely gimp your mining capabilities, because it is obviously not designed for combat in any way form or fashion.ccp will most likely eventually add an armed mining vessal, simply because it is a role and niche industrial pilots simply do not have access to in game, and is one thing the game is really missing to help merge the 2 more fluidly."
8/31/2014,show me a ganking frigate that does 500-700 dps.
8/31/2014,"not even my full-gank enyo goes that much over 400 dps. but yeah... op should just go with my procurer fit. it easily gets 55+k ehp and, when properly skilled, can handily kill battleship npcs in low-sec.also... lily... procurers and skiffs when fit for combat are doing ~200+ dps. not a lot mind you... but nothing to sniff at either. it's the average dps of a tech 1 frigate (with a battlecruiser class tank behind it)."
8/31/2014,"what? you want a mining barge capable of entry level battleship damage? battlecruiser? apparently the concept of mining barge simply eludes your grasp. what you're asking for is the equivalent of putting this on this.your errors are further compounded by your apparent lack of comprehension as to how combat works in eve. according to you, dps is everything, and being able to tank incoming damage is meaningless. i put shahfluffers procurer fit into eft and my lowest skilled mining alt can get 64k ehp out of it. how long do you think it'll take a full ganked fit frigate to deplete 64k ehp? keep in mind a full ganked fit frigate has no tank to speak of, so will be very vulnerable to the flight of light drones unleashed by the procurer.yes, this is exactly, right. not only that, it's how ccp ******* designed it after the most recent change to mining barges.right. let me say it again, because you're obviously having difficulty understanding this simple concept. it is a mining ship, not a combat ship.no, they will not likely add an armed mining vessel. the mining vessels currently designed to actually engage in combat are very well done, when you consider that they're not combat vessels."
8/31/2014,"while maria may have meant what you inferred, it may also be less drastic.while i admittedly assume much by this, i like to think players want a balanced play experience. too much or too little chance of success, and the game becomes too predictable.i feel a good trade off for cloaked vulnerability, would be matching vulnerability on the pve side.both sides capable of more than compensating for this vulnerability by making proper efforts.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
