9/1/2009,"i like the fact that insurance issues are heating up more, but proposed changes so far are pretty horrid. insurance in this game is a good thing. people should be encouraged to insure ships because it does promote more pvp activities. that said, people should not be unjustly rewarded, and loopholes in the insurance system should not be exploited. insurance is the single biggest inflationary pressure on this game. daily, isk are being flooded into the market due to insurance without any player driven effort. if i build a beam and i die, i likely loose the beam. but if i build a ship and it get's blown up, i get rewarded. main issues:insurance scamming - i build and insure a ship, 2 months and 29 days later the ship is still alive. it's better for me to blow the ship up and get a new one than it is to insure this one agian. why? if i build the battleship for 85 mil of mineral cost. i insure it once for 30 mil meaning my total investment is 115 mil. if the insurance runs its cycle, i have 2 options. 1 is i can insure again, meaning i have to invest another 30 mil for a total of 145 mil invested. the other option is i can have it destroyed. if i destroy the ship, lets say i receive 110 mil of plat insurance. i've lost 5 mil. if the ship that's been insured 2x get's blown up by comparison, i've lost 35 mil. leading me to blow up the ship i own, buy a new one, rather than insure the old one twice. no place for secure space: currently, with the smallest of exceptions, there is no distinct difference between a .5 system and a 1.0 system, a .4 system and a .1 system. why? aren't we taught that a 1.0 system has a much better safe zone than a .5?clumsiness: lets face it, people make mistakes. it happens, it sucks, that's the beauty of insurance. but why should someone be rewarded equally for the same mistake over and over and over again, especially in a short period of time? screw up once, and hey, it happens, but do it 10 times in a week, and well, maybe you might just be a risk. ===================so what can be done to fix these problems?no insurance, no reward. 40% base pay needs to go. you shouldn't be rewarded if you don't insure. it's an unneccesary burden on the economy when isk flows in without a good drain, and insurance needs to be a small drain. insurance needs to be more dynamic. no more 3 month insurance cycles. change insurance cycles to 1 to 2 week intervals, and reduce insurance plans base cost accordingly. additionaly, add in a tracker. player statistics need to have some role on insurance. to insure a ship of whatever type, the insurer must consider what your current performance rate is with that ship. so your weekly stats will show: i've lost 3 battleships, 4 cruisers and 1 frigate. based on the previous 7 days performance, battleship insurance cost will increase by 1.3times the base cost, cruiser insurance will increase by 1.4 times the base cost. frigate cost will increase by 1.1 times. please note the tracker will only consider recent events. meaning if you have a run of bad luck, it won't hurt you forever, but it will mean you need to be more cautious in the short term. base insurance cost. if we're going to lower the insurance time to 1-2 week cycles, the cost cannot drop at the same rate. it would just become way way to cheap to insure. so rates should drop to about 1/2 of their current cost. this means players who have no expectations of losing their ships can make the choice, do i pay immediately, or do i wait for a more risky scenario. secruity levels cost and payouts:a player who loses a ship in a high sec system should garner less penalty for repeated offenses with the exception of wars. so if the scale of losing x amount of ships per 7 days were 10% extra cost per in 0.0, then in 1.0, maybe it would be 5% more cost. again, excluding war targets where the normal 10% would apply."
9/1/2009,supported
9/1/2009,"finally, remove insurance payouts for 3 task. self destructs, death by turret guns, and death by concord. removing those 3 payouts adds an element of risk to crime. lowsec isn't hurt horrendously, because honestly how often do people lose ships to gate guns. but high sec gets a bigger hit. it also removes the desire for people to self destruct ships in losing scenarios unless they want to prevent loot drops. self destruct removal also prevents forms of insurance scamming. all of these features together should provide an adequately friendly pvp insurance system, protection for empire players, and a revamp to a desperately poor and exploited system."
9/1/2009,"that's...a lot of stuff. on the face of it, i like some of what you have in there.however, i have a problem with this bitspecifically, the flawed assumption that the system where i insure my ship is necessarily the system i use it in. i could just as easily fly four jumps over to a 1.0 system, buy the ship i want because it's the only place i can find one, insure it there, and then fly back to my 0.5 system, while paying 1.0 insurance rates.i'm not ready to support this idea yet, because it's got so many moving parts, and i want to see how they shake out as more people post, but i like the overall thrust."
9/1/2009,"that's exactly where the 2nd part of system security comes in. losing a ship in a less secure system penalizes me more than in a higher sec system creating more balance to the scenario. what that does is promote more travel between systems, which in high sec is more opportunity for piracy and war decs.remember, it's very hard to move unpackaged ships in high sec in bulk. if you're talking 12 mil to insure a teir 2 bs in a 1.0, and it's a 3% reduction per sec point, then in a 0.1, it's only going to cost about 15 mil. 3 mil in savings isn't a huge deal to a lot of people, but it does create a small incentive to move that ship to another station putting you more at risk."
9/1/2009,i'm with de on this one... everything seems to be ok except that one bit just utterly does not make any bit of sense to me.oh and i'm not supporting this unless concord voids insurance.... amongst other things that are obvious.
9/1/2009,i'll remove it until further review and thought.
9/1/2009,"she does specifically mention that in her second post (after the first support post - i think someone got thumb happy). self-destructs, gate guns, and concord deaths no longer generate insurance payouts, which i have wanted for a long time.i mean at least a month, which for me is like nearly forever. i am going to give this a tentative thumb at this point, and we'll see what shakes out of it.edit: thumb failure."
9/1/2009,"while from a ""realistic"" pov (if there is such thing, as it does not make any sense at all) insurance should be cheaper in hisec than in 0.0, from a gameplay pov the contrary probably should apply.insurance is there to promote pvp, and pvp is (arguably, i know) more risky the lower the security status (well, hisec > lowsec > 0.0). coupled with dynamic price due to ""clumsiness"", it all should even out (as you're supposed to lose more ships in low/null than in hisec).anyway, supporting it, it's time for a review of insurance and so far i like your propposed changes except the mentioned issue.nijaedit for support, damnit"
9/1/2009,yeah i know... but i'm making it clear that is my pet peeve at this point...tentative support.
9/1/2009,"this is a historic moment.2nd part of post got cut off by a damn rainbow warrior from ff wouldn't you know, but it does deal with concord/sd deaths."
9/1/2009,"removing payouts from self-destructs is pointless. it seems sensible, but faces the same problem as bounties: it's impossible to accomplish its intended goal when there are no negative consequences for fraud. i can easily self-destruct without ""self-destructing"" by setting autopilot for amamake and going afk.the argument that ships inject money directly into circulation is a bit of a flawed one too: procuring the material to build ships takes time, time which could be spent doing missions or killing npcs which also injects it into circulation, but at a higher rate. nevermind the countless ships in highsec which have not been destroyed and may never be, especially freighters.regardless, insurance does have issues, but you missed what they actually are. the entire premise of the insurance system is flawed:1.) there is no way to effectively model risk. without that, it is impossible to determine appropriate premiums.2.) there are no negative consequences for fraud. real-world insurance companies have ways of avoiding issuing policies to people who are just trying to file a claim. they will either refuse to cover you, or it will be illegal to deliberately force a claim. in eve, there is no way to detect that sort of thing, nevermind punish for it.3.) bearable losses don't warrant insurance in the first place. nobody insures things they can bear to lose, except maybe extended warranties which are still subject to point #2. insurance is there for things that have low odds and are devastating to lose. people buy policies as a shield from financial devastation, not to gamble with the insurance company that they will be able to file a claim."
9/1/2009,"it's an interesting concern, and i think it does address some real problems, but on the whole i think it'd wreck a mostly-functional system. basically, you'd be transforming the system from added security for the person who loses the occasional ship to free money for people who lose ships regularly, even more so than it is at present. a week or two is not a long enough insurance contract for the scrubbish missioner, but it's plenty long enough for a 0.0 player who loses three ships in a fight. furthermore, while you solve the problem of people self-destructing on day 89, i think you've created a far worse problem of self-destructing on day 6. instead of buying 100 mil of coverage for 30 mil, you'd be buying it for 15 mil in 0.0, or 10.5 mil in 1.0, but the payout would be the same. that makes flipping it over even more profitable, and it means it'll happen dramatically more often. essentially, what this proposal would do in the end is nerf insurance for people who are actually using it as insurance, and buff it for people who are using it as free isk(bar suicide gankers, but they're minor). i can't support that."
9/1/2009,"i like this proposal i do. but to interfere with drake a bit here.i don't think that concord should void insurance.what about this.two timeframes and one period of paying the price..timeframe 1: 7daystimeframe 2: 30 dayspaying the price: activates after timeframe 2.ok, so, if a person for whatever reason trigger concord. timeframe 1 and 2, 7days. if a ship is illegally fired upon, tf 1 will engage, if a ship is illegally fired upon again within tf 1, void insurance. if a ship is shot at after tf 1, but whithin tf2 ,(note that it can only fit 4x tf 1 within tf 2) reduce insurance payout to 50%. if a ship is illegally fired upon after the 2nd tf 1, withing tf 2. reduce to 25%.(tf2 (tf1 100%)(tf2 50%)(tf3 25%)(tf4 void))(2nd period 30days void insurance)(tf2 (tf1 void)(tf2 void)(2nd period void insurance)(tf2 (tf1 void)(tf2 50%)(tf3 void)(2nd period void)with this system you can void yourself all insurance payouts from concord related death for two months!4th tf 1 withing tf 2. void insurance. this is important. if a ship is illegally fired upon 4 times within tf 2, void insurance globally for death by concord for a certain ammount of time. say 1 month, and then the process starts over again.effects. only once a month can you have 100% payback on insurance if killed by concord or whatever reason. if you continue to do this, you will not receive any insurance payouts.if this is implemented in the idea, i think i'll actually support it!we all have lost at least one shiny ship (relative to character age) to concord. don't void the insurance totally!"

9/1/2009,"no insurance payouts in 0.0 and lo-sec space, which insurance company is stupid enough to pay out on a claim like that?!and no insurance payouts when you get killed by concord.shiplosses don't mean enough right now."
9/1/2009,"this is a non-issue. ship prices are driven by demand. if people thought ships were worth more to lose after insurance, then their prices would be higher.removing insurance would simply result in a massive crash in t1 material prices until they settled around the same post-insurance values, because ships are the main thing keeping t1 material prices where they are. it's a flawed system, but it is not one that is causing any sort of problem, outside of disproportionate representation on ships that are generally uninsured, i.e. capital ships.removing insurance payout in 0.0 is a terrible idea. increasing the difficulty of replacing losses only results in more risk aversion and less action. look at anything that is disproportionately expensive to replace for a nice example of this, i.e. command ships and supercapitals."

9/1/2009,"it needs more add, you mean. not votes.1. socialising is not an argument. it is a social paradigm which stands independant of mechanisms or even features. if there were not a single communications channel in game, people would still communicate and socialize.2. macro's would florish, since as long as the current scanning mechanisms remain unchanged all they would have to do is adapt on a technical level, something which most of the newer generations of macro software already do, for example for w-space mining.3. the tactical argument is invalid, since it is solely based on individual perception, and not on either mindset, best practices or the need of human beings to seek shelter in herds.truth be told, the proposed ""change"" would only drive the player groups with such mindsets (and unfortunately they are the majority) to overcompensate. it's why this ""proposal"" comes across almost as an old time structural mistake ccp has often made, underestimating the insanity of its players.bellum, just think for a moment. imagine someone up north having to run ice mining operations because the isotope prices in empire are going silly. picture 50+ mackinaws in a belt. now with these proposed changes, they would throw anything into the belt from orca's to logistics to even titans, since people are crazy about not wanting to take uncalculated risks.you are thinking that because of the changes you suggest you would be able to get in with a small group, do a few ganks, and force them to engage with similar smallish fast ships to defend their losses.in reality they would just pump as many people as they could into the belt, the system, and the constellation. both to prevent the risk of getting ganked, and to mop up afterwards should anything get through.but wait, this is not a theoretical example. this is a common appearance. this is actually already a standard doctrine in a lot of places. the changes you propose would only drive them to go even crazier.but, to add insult to injury, in spite of all that blobbing and paranoia displayed, they regularly get their behinds spanked, losing dozens of ships in the process, regardless of local as this imaginary realtime intel tool, regardless of having titans and logistics in the belts, regardless of having multiple blobs running around.how? a few people running around with black ops and bombers.brainpower. effort. result.4. a compromise is only a compromise if parties or ideas meet somewhere in between of respective viewpoints. your proposal is not a compromise, it is an attempt to pick up on a playstyle which got traumatised by blobbing and blobs being far richer then the ganker groups. in the mean time plenty of people have picked up and adapted, getting not only results in spite of what those rich blobs throw at them, but having a ball doing so as well.anyhow. i'm sorry, but this i just can't support. i agree that changes are required, there is a structural need for eve having a degree of ""fog of war"", but not by introducing good oldfashioned kneejerk changes. scanning as a mechanism has technical limitations, as visible in the recent changes to the scanning interval. the idea of even half the rich blobbing bears and macro'ers starting to hammer the scanner every two seconds affecting the cluster is rather unnerving, considering ccp had to change that interval already. thus forcing people to adapt in their own blobbish ways is neither promoting fun gameplay the way you want it, nor is it promoting stable gameplay the way you want it :pif the technicalities of scanning are changed, perhaps this can get looked at again. eve does need a different mechanisms in my humble opinion however.until someone comes up with a concept which would not be counterproductive to fun, by not taking (disfunctional) mindsets into account, we are going to have to make do with local and scanning as it is."
9/1/2009,yes
9/1/2009,"it's amazing that there until you disable them, there are warning windows for every single little thing you do in eve, yet there isn't one for an action, the only thing that will potentially cost you a month of irrevocably lost training time. maybe it's a concious decision by ccp to get a sliver more cash by making people with podded alpha clones play for longer - either way it's really terrible and lame.yeah, you might think ""i'm careful, forgetting to update my clone would never happen to me"" - until it does. the pace of getting new ships for big battles can be frantic, you might fly several accounts and forget to update some... so in reality, getting podded in an alpha clone is more likely than you think.ps: there isn't even a quick way to telling whether your clone is up to date - unlike in any other window in the game, the information on the character screen appears slooowwwwlly one character/line at the time, and the current clone information is at the very bottom. coincidence?"

9/1/2009,"currently, you only get security status gains for one rat every 15 minutes.now let's say you're at -10. you've decided that being a pirate had its charm, but not you want to get back into high-sec wars, or possibly even veldspar mining in the comfort of high security space.the best rat for sec status i know of gives 0.4%, which, compared to other rats i know of, is absolutely enormous.however, if you're at -10, you'd have to kill one hundred and twenty seven of those rats to get back over -2.0 and have access to high-security space.""fair enough"", you might say. ""he chose that route when he podded and attacked all those innocent carebears in low-sec"". while that's a legitimate opinion, surely you agree that if he has to kill 127 rats, the least you could do is grant him the possibility of shooting them all in a row.if he has to wait 15 minutes b/e each rat, he takes over 31 hours to have access to high-sec.that's over the top.i suggest that ccp find a way to solve this. some examples are:* make rats with bigger sec status boosts, as well as a helpful page on the evelopedia where players can find the places to rat for sec status, in high sec, in low sec, and in null sec.* get rid of the timer* make the timer shorter* make high security status work correctly so that someone with -2.7, for example, can actually go to high-sec, so that having a low sec status is less harsh.if i need to make myself clear on the last suggestion, here's the explanation.currently, a person with, for example b/e -2 and -2.5 should be able to go anywhere except 1.0.however, if they have to travel through a 1.0 system to get to a 0.9 system, they get an agression flag for passing through 1.0, and then get shot by the navy in 0.9. this is ridiculous and makes the whole security status / system security rules useless, because as soon as you're under -2 you're unable to really travel through high-sec."
9/1/2009,"supporting this, as everyone in their rightful mind should.nb: i'm not a pirate myself. i podded one person because it was the first time i had managed to caught a pod and have lived in high-sec ever since.i'm posting this for two reasons:* i'd like to be able to go to low-sec from time to time and not farm for ages to recover sec.* i'd like it to be easier for people to decide to live in low-sec as -10s. the current penalties are extremely harsh. there are many other sources of unconsensual pvp (high sec wars for example) in eve and they're not penalized at all."
9/1/2009,"under the impression that a -10 pirate can grind his way back within 31 hours (theoretically), sec status should update only once a day."
9/1/2009,"having done the -10 to -2 grind on three pilots, its not all that bad tbh.i would prefer to see them remove the faction police spawns for outlaws in high sec. as an outlaw in highsec, any other player anywhere in the game would be able to freely attack you. and concord would still spawn if an outlaw attacks someone else first illegally."
9/1/2009,"making it harder to pvp in low-sec than in high-sec doesn't make sense.a high-sec war decc is even harder on a carebear corp than a travel through low-sec.traveling through low-sec can be avoided at the cost of a longer journey. with a high-sec war decc, wherever they are, they're vulnerable.yet we don't lower the sec status of members of a corp that deccs another corp.while i believe that the whole sec status mechanic, for the previous reason, makes no sense, i think that a step to fairness would be to make grinding sec status easier."
9/1/2009,"31 hours to grind from -10 to -2 sounds (nearly too) easy, considering the impact on the game."
9/1/2009,you mean that people who were partaking in unconsensual pvp would be able to go to high sec easily.but wait! they can! look at those who use high sec wars! so why shouldn't low-sec pirates be able to?

9/1/2009,"i don't understand how any of your proposed solutions address the problems you declared. instead of requiring somebody to spend a lot of time in an ice belt with a mackinaw, you instead require them to spend a little time in a belt and the rest of the time logged out while their ice gets processed...?"
9/1/2009,and you think the wait times are long for research slots.
9/1/2009,"the problem atm is that to mine ice (which everyone needs) you are forced to mine for hours upon end just to get a small amount even in a large group. this is mind-numbing gameplay and requires no interaction at all from the player but pushing a button every so many minutes depending on the ship used.if the processing is moved towards a structure, ship or bpc then the mining part will become not the long slow process which promotes the use of macro's but it will become more of a logistical and production matter.the process will become more player involved due to the fact that the cubes need to be transported to the refinery, the refinery needs to be maintained and defended and the end product must be delivered. it may in fact lead to less time being spend on the entire process but the time spend on it now just to get enough fuel for a tower is by far not realistic."
9/1/2009,sounds much more interesting than the current system.
9/1/2009,supported!
9/1/2009,"i think to make the belts more realistic (yes yes i know this game is completely unrealistic) not only should the roids contain all the ores as akita suggested but also ice... if we look at the roid belt between mars and jupiter u can bet that there is a mix of ore type roids and ice type roids the same would apply to both the kuiper belt and then oort cloud. so instead of just ore only belts i think all belts should be a mix of ice and ore roids. also a new ship that could be added to the game is the terraformer/colony ship.... as players fly about in 0.0 they can scan planets and find uninhabited worlds and terraform them... level 1 terraforming allows you colonize earth like worlds level 2 allows u terraform desert worlds and then colonize them level 3 allows you terraform ocean worlds, level 4 allows you terraform volcanic worlds, level 5 allows you terraform ice worlds. these new colonies would count towards sov in the system and could then be linked into dust 514 for planet side battles. also once a world is first colonised the alliance that colonised it gets to name that world. much like the way outposts get renamed. only gas giants cannot be terraformed or colonised."
9/1/2009,"zydrine and megacyte frequently drop to 50% below peak, and ore value frequently drops to 40% below peak for months at a time. at the low point this year, a max-skilled hulk would be pulling about 35m/hr off of arkonor, minus time spent hauling, which is kind of mediocre, especially considering that it involves several months of training that are utterly useless for anything else."
9/1/2009,"the best solution i've ever seen to the moongold bottleneck, mining unprofitably, and 0.0/hisec balance (by seriously increasing the value of access to high-value ore while only effecting the tiny minority of players with serious moongold access negatively) i've seen.this is a simple and elegant solution to a lot of eve's current economic problems and imbalances. well thought out, kudos to you op.although frankly i have no clue if the numbers are right; i don't do either mining or t2 production."
9/1/2009,i think ccp should handle the numbers but this sounds like a sweet idea. i like the idea of forcing it to be compressed. this might push me over the edge for getting a rorqual.
9/1/2009,this sounds fun and interesting.
9/1/2009,"mixing dysprosium and promethium into other items isn't really a great solution because it's uncontrollable and could do anything from very little (if they don't make their source worthwhile) to crash the market for them (if it causes a glut of unneeded supply, i.e. certain salvage items and thulium).ideally, there should be choice involved: either produce just dysprosium/promethium via some mechanism, or don't produce it at all. doing that means their supply can be easily scaled up or down to meet demand without unwanted byproducts."
9/1/2009,"this is excellent, and will be added up top. while i might differ somewhat on your implementation (e.g. i'm not sure that requiring rorquals is necessarily the best solution) the general concept is solid."

9/2/2009,does make sense this way to have more r.o.f rather that a specific dmg type. like you said when your in pvp with missiles you always try to get the best dmg type which is not always kin in any case.better than the system we got now. i personally dont like to have 1 specific dmg type for a ship since it penalize you with other types. pve or pvp ofc

9/2/2009,"not supported.kinetic damage is caldari racial flavor, it needs to stay that way."
9/2/2009,"in that case would you support the following.amarr only get 5% bonus to em component of damage from laser + 5% to em dronesgallente only get 5% bonus to thermal component of damage from hybrids + 10% to therm drones onlyminimatar only get 5% bonus to explosive component of damage from projectilescurrently only caldari suffer from a racial bonus, other races get damage bonuses to all damage types they do with exception of the 4 ships listed in the op.get your facts straight before you post."
9/2/2009,"not supported. lasers have mostly em, with a little therm. hybrid is mostly kinetic with a portion of therm. projectile is mostly explo. yes you can get other damage with proj, but then it is projectile (low rof, low optimal, low clip size). any damage bonus on hybrid or lasers is quite similar to the 5% kinetic bonus, and the damage bonus on projectiles is well . . on projectiles.every weapon system is limted. if caldari got rof accross the board where would the drawback be? my phoon gets rof, but then it is trully split weapons, and only 4 launchers. but, those 4 launchers consistently outdamage and outrange their gun counterparts similarly bonused.edit- missiles can still be swapped to address a tank focused on one or two damage types. gun damage type (again except projectile . . .) cannot be swapped out to address an opposing tank."
9/2/2009,"if caldari got rof accross the board where would the drawback be?no other ship has a drawback for training the skill level up.why should caldari missile users be expected to lose there ship damage bonus when other races do not ?if your using proj on a proj bonused ship you always get a 5% rof or damage bonus for every level you have trained on that ship type.this is not true for caldari missile boats , when a players switches out ammo type to ( em missile / thermal missile / explosive missile ) the damage bonus for traing for example lvl 5 caldari cruiser goes missing.the damage bonuses for mini/gallente/amarr ships are allways there."
9/2/2009,"the drawback is that if we use any other type of dmg, we got no bonus. while other weapons usually get 2 type of dmg. (excluding proj which have 3 sometimes.) thats why it would be better with r.o.f.also, like you know (if you don't you'll know it). missiles + pvp = not so good because of dps. so having more r.o.f should be better. i dont have the numbers but guns are win in pvp compared to missiles usually and most of the timeedit: ^ thats another way of saying it lol. you beat me to it"
9/2/2009,pure damage bonus rather than 'kinetic' would be preferred... i'd take rof though
9/2/2009,"there is wonderful thing called falloff (i.e. paper damage is not always there) and missiles tend to outrange their gun counterparts, excepting on certain range bonused ships. again though, you have the option to switch damage if your damage type bonus is essentially neutered. a gun user does not."
9/2/2009,"i'm caldari. i fly almost exclusively caldari. i don't support this. caldari missile boats do just fine. other races don't get to pick their damage type -- they're stuck with one or two types, and it is always those types. you'll never find a ship in another race that has ""+5% damage per level to any weapon you fit"". caldari is the ""kinetic"" race -- their resistances are high in kinetic, and their damage is primarily kinetic. that's the way the game has been designed. and it's perfectly fair.this has been done on purpose; if you need proof, just look at the kestrel which gets a good bonus to kinetic, and a sub-standard bonus to every other missile type. there are some ships which already have rate-of-fire bonuses instead of damage bonuses -- if you must choose your type, fly one of these ships. (hint: half of the cerberus' damage bonus is an rof bonus; all of the rook's damage bonus is an rof bonus)if you think a ship is vulnerable to a specific type of damage, use that type of missile; most ships these days are tanked evenly across the board (or at least as much as possible). if anything, kinetic has an advantage because of all the people mouthing off that caldari (the ""kinetic"" race) has some sort of birth defect when it comes to pvp."
9/2/2009,and drones? how about fighters? shall we make it so that amarr carriers get to deploy an additional templar per level instead of fighters? either way works for me.i don't use missiles btw.

9/2/2009,"look, if ccp did this would there ever be a reason not to use a drake in pve? an afk drake for all seasons. you ignore the further imbalancing of pve if this change were implemented for a pvp bonus. you think you see a lot of drakes and ravens etc in mission hubs now!let me try to find some common ground as i will never support your proposal and i highly doubt ccp will do what you want. a change should be made not to the ship bonuses but to the missiles themselves. as things are now all missiles have the same stats. a thor torpedo is no different from a rift torpedo except in the type of damage. how about if kinetic missiles as a class had a better max velocity? wouldn't that make them more useful for pvp, and take more advantage of the caldari kinetic bonus (as well as being scientifcally consistent). then explo missiles could have better stat for explo radius, em missiles better stat for explo velocity, and thermal a slightly better base damage. this would make missiles similar to drones, particularly as to sentry drones and light drones, where the type to use has factors beyond the damage type. so if you want slightly better range or speed to target and the benefit of the kinetic damage bonus use kinetic. if range or speed to target is not an issue you have a second damage option, thermal. if the speed or sig radius of the target is an issue . . ."
9/2/2009,"if i come off with a ""it's that way now, so it must always be that way"" tune, that's not the way this is intended. i used to think that they should get a bonus to all missiles; but i thought about it for a while and came to the conclusion that a buff like that would unbalance the caldari ships.and the different types have a different range and do different amounts of damage; if you want the maximum damage output, you have to chose the close range ammunition which is explosive/kinetic. again, if you want maximum range, you have to choose the long-range ammunition which is also explosive/kinetic. a minmitar's choice is more about the range they want rather than the damage type they want to deal. caldari get the same range and same damage output from each of the four missile types.i'll give you that one; but there are penalties the gallente pay for that: their dps can be destroyed and for maximum dps they still have to use the thermal drones as the others don't quite do as much damage. also, you can't carry five lights and five heavies from each race (unless you're an ishtar and you can fit a whole carrier in your drone bay) whereas missile users can fit as many different types of ammo in their cargo hold as they have room for.isn't that what i said? missiles just get one type of damage; it's different, but it's not unbalanced.giving the caldari a bonus to whatever damage type they want would push them too high. we already get to choose to have a weapon system that concentrates all of its power in a single damage type -- if we know where the hole is, we can take advantage of it. if an amarr pilot knows that the target is vulnerable to explosive, he doesn't have much of a choice about what to do."
9/2/2009,"fail. i don't even fail like explaining why because it shouldn't be that hard to see. racial bonus should stay as is.edit: i'm bored so i'll take a stab at it.yes but unfortunately you only do em and thermal.you do multiple damage types but not in the same way missiles do, your damage is spread between 2-3 different types.you only do thermal and kinetic.with missiles you can therm/kin/exp/em and exploit the racial tank holes of the other races easier. sure it's not as effective as if you were using kinetic but you can do explosive damage where hybrids are stuck with therm/kin..."
9/2/2009,"as a caldari/minmatar combat pilot, i understand the frustration of that damage bonus - but i also understand the reasons for it.missiles have too many disadvantages to ""balance"" their two advantages - damage type selection and 0 cap use. with the exception of hams, all missiles do noticeably less damage than their counterparts (rockets and cruise missiles in particular are very poor weapon types), and their damage boosting mods require more cpu. while their range is typically better than blasters and autocannons of the same size, this was intended to compensate for the time it takes for them to hit their targets. the fact that one of their advantages - damage type selection - is negated by the ship bonuses of the majority of ships intended to use them just adds insult to injury.i would say either give us a rof bonus or buff missiles across the board to be more effective damage dealers, in line with blasters and autos."
9/2/2009,"yes it would make drake a bit better at pve , ravens dont get the kin bonus atm they get r.o.f. and are fine.nh would also benefit for pve, other races also have good pve ships. i personal like the ishtar as it is ecm/damp proof and can salvage as it goes , even if its a bit slower than drake/nh.re-engineering of missile combat might be a solution, as long as i always get a damage bonus on dps bonused ships for each levels of that ship class skill i have trained.but i dont think missiles are broken to the extent of requireing a rewrite.whats broken imho is the kin bonuses.because having a bonus which increases dps only on one damage type is incompatible with combat tactics that require you to change damage type in order to do significant damage on target.i'm not trying to make missile boats op.if the bonuses did get changed and it did make cmb's overpowered then a small change in base missile damage would be enough to rebalance that.but after both changes we would be left with a situation where a lvl5 pilot is 20% more effective than a lvl1 pilot.a situation that other race pilots take for granted.class for class cmb's are generally not as useful in solo/small gang pvp as the other races and this could be the shot in the arm that they need."

9/2/2009,your gallente so you must be refering to drones yes ?this is a thread about missiles and missile bonuses on caldari ships
9/2/2009,one last thing i need to point outi dont ever remember anyone saying the sacrilege is overpoweredit get damage and rof bonuses to short range high damage missilesif the sac is fine then the same bonuses can be applied to caldari missiles boats without issue.
9/2/2009,"things do not have to be the same to be balanced.the sacrilege also has no range bonus which limits the usefulness of it's heavy assault missiles. note also that it does not gain a bonus to heavy missiles (which have a very long range, and which have long-range ammunition that does as much damage as its close-range ammunition).you can't pick one example and hold it up as a shining beacon of light and knowledge all by itself; look at all of the ships in relation to one another.the ishkur has drones and it is accepted as balanced; why don't all assault frigates get drones? all assault frigates should get drones and they will all be balanced.heck, why am i arguing? please make my missile boats more powerful."
9/2/2009,"the reason you feel missile boats are sub par is because you don't understand how to use missiles, not because the weapon itself is lacking. missiles get many bonuses that the other 3 races do not. missiles always hit, even if for little damage, they always hit. on ships of even size and larger, that advantage becomes more pronounced when tracking fails. missiles also get more average range and consistent damage at all ranges where as turret ships have to swap down to lower dps ammo and less varied damage on those ammos. lastly, missile boats do consistently better damage or near equivalent damage to their turret counterparts if you compare apples to apples. you can't for instance compare a heavy launcher cerb to a blaster deimos because one is set for range, the other for cc. add to all of that the fact that missiles get 4 flavors of damage, you're always likely to get the best damage results shot for shot if you understand statistics.for instance, you say to use exp ammo on armor tankers.... that's actually not true. depending on the class, ship and platform on that ship, there are different ammo's to choose each time. regional affects also matter. if i go to war with someone in caldari space, i'm likely to have a different ammo in than if i go to war with someone in amarr space. why? because there's already an inherent chance that they're not even fit for pvp, which means there a high likelyhood that they're tanked a certain way. knowing where and when to use what type of ammo gives you that extra advantage.gal, min, amarr, none of them with the exception of drone or missle boats get that same luxury. the only issue missles really have atm is their damage vs speed. even ships like the nighthawk, that get bonuses to cope with this struggle a lot with even mild speed."
9/2/2009,"/support - because missiles need some love. already low paper dps, plus damage reduction from anything not webbed make it (theoretically speaking) the lowest dps in the game, and almost unviable in pvp, plus drones can do the same job almost as well./no support - as aforementioned, racial bonus problems. plus any pvp'er worth his weight knows that paper dps means nothing in the world of eve, as it assumes perfect conditions.all in all, i have used both missiles and turrets in pvp, and they both have their problems. im no great war hero but seems to me that kinetic damage would only have a great impact on t1 pvp. most t2 fits ive seen have had strong omni-tanks.

9/2/2009,when trying to free up a very small % of the server at the cost of compromising gameplay (including but not restricted to the new fail scanner) it will annoy a lot of people. and a few things to think about. 1 being the change annoyed 90% of eve (bar the ret-rded people who just wish they could live in a box and rat all day in 0.0) and we have gained something unnoticeable to the players it has affected. that something is an extra 0.0000000001% server efficiency or w/e. i think i can speak people for everyone (bar ret-rds like yourself) when i say i'd rather that 0.0000001% of lag for the real super scanner back.if you're getting killed all the time because you're a moron and can't make money go ebay.if ccp want to make a real change to the server they should do it without compromising pvp (i don't have the solution in my hat) wheres this super computer that will 'kill all lag' i've heard about so long ago etc.(p.s. i do not support nor am i involved in any form of isk selling.)

9/2/2009,"i will say i'm running under the assumption that market prices are floored because of insurance in it's current state. i'd expect ship prices to rise after these changes went in. if they didn't, i'd fully expect the payouts to be tweaked downward just so that wouldn't happen. self destructing is a non factor as there would be no payout for it. if you have someone else destroy your ship for you, then you're increasing your premium. i set the increase at 10% cost for shear example sake. it could easily go higher if not much higher depending on testing. numbers imo are always arbitrary on this forum til testing, it's the concepts that matter. numbers can always be tweaked. the whole 7 day system is the best way to limit how many ships people can lose or fraudulently destroy. if 7 days isn't enough, maybe make it 14, or 30. whatever it takes for the system to work.do people lose ships in 1 day, yes. but under the current system, they're basically insuring any ship they get upon assembly and then housing multiple ships in their hanger ready to go. if it's a matter of constant insurance updates, then insurance would likely be forgotten or run out far more often, making it financially cumbersome on people who were not cautious enough to keep their insurance up to date. there is no way to take drastic measures in insurance imo. i think this system works as an adequate base to build on base on my 0.0 and empire pvp experiences.i fully understand the arguements that are being made against this, but i think they are based on too litteral of translations of the post. understand that it's a base to work off of, not the final solution."
9/2/2009,yes sir.........i like it.

9/2/2009,i love seeing my logs show 1100 damage in 2 volleys and consulting the killboards to find it only registered 400 of it!

9/2/2009,"one thing thats been overlooked and everyone still seems pretty clueless about is... the moon mining exploit that affected one of the reactions... cant remember which, but basically allowed infinite amounts of some major t2 component to be produced without any of the required items to do so, after 4 years of this bug going ""undetected"" and some mass ban-hammering, prices for t2 naturally went up, because one of the items dropped in supply by an astonishing amount.ccp has changed the supply of this, subsequently changing the prices, which after 4 years of getting used to buying hacs/recons at 50-80m is not going to go over well with most people.also, lol at pl in this thread, you guys damn near control t2 prices what should happen imo is the material requirements for t2 should be tweaked slightly, just enough to reign in t2 prices a bit..."
9/2/2009,"not supported. because the price on all tech ii is symptomatic of other problems. there are two causes. if you read the latest quarterly economic report it is the dominance of tech ii bpo due to much better me lower build costs in the tech ii ship markets (try inventing ships and producing, it's mostly not economical, not to mention the hastle of gathering the components). also, as has been stated earlier in this thread, it is the static r64s and the increasingly napped cartels that control them that are the root of the problem with prices.solutions, boost the base me on invent jobs, and remove static moon mins. why can't static moon mins be removed as static complexes were? make them deplete and respawn elsewhere. no reason to have them stuck in one place in perpetuity. if they periodically get reshuffled then everyone has to explore and consider territorial moves on neighbors instead of the boring static borders we have now with 2 powerblocks (possibly soon to be essentially one). 0.0 with two ""sides"" is already dull enough. imagine it with one. isn't this what happened to the chinese server?"
9/2/2009,heres a reason... naptrains are boring!
9/2/2009,"how so?are you onboard? get out of the corp/alliance.are they your enemies? more to shoot!are they somewhere else where you don't even go? why do they bother you?in any case, you cannot and should not force people not to be friends.if the game doesn't allow it, they'll simply use other methods.maybe there will be more ""friendly fire"", but surely not more hostility.intel channels will have to do more out-of-game checks, that's all."
9/2/2009,it's called clicking the undock button.
9/2/2009,"how about we just make a skill called diplomatic regulation which adds one additional high standings slot for every level (except level iii), and then a skill called advanced diplomatic regulation that adds one more per level. maybe an implant too?"
9/2/2009,"before beginning, i warn my suggestion will seem unimportant and effectless at first sight, so please hold your ""bs!"" reaction until having read to the end.i propose that market order prices should all be ""sufficiently round"" numbers. my specific suggestion for the interpretation of ""sufficiently round"" is 3 valuable digits, i.e. prices below 10 isk can contain cents like 1.23 isk, prices between 10 and 100 isk should be like 12.30 isk (i.e tens of cents are allowed), prices between 100 and 1000 isk should be integer (whole) numbers like 123 isk, and so on.this is easy to implemet and can be done in a no-hassle way: if you enter an improper price when creating/modifying an order, it is automatically rounded (with or without a warning message).already existing market orders can be updated by a once-run automatic process, or simply left untouched until they get filled or expire.first, why is it not bad? one can easily counter that it is bad idea because it limits choices as you can not set whatever prices. i counter that you can still set prices in increments that is between 0.1 and 1 % of the value, which should be enough for all normal trading purposes. clearly, human mind tends to like round numbers. fex, imagine haggling for a $50k family home - who in his right mind will ask for a discount to $47 642.73? you will clearly suggest 47k or 47.5k. or imagine a salary negotiation situation - an offer of $5k/month can be seriously countered with $5423.79 or $5500? think you got my point.side note (can be skipped): market system of eve exactly mimics an orerbook-based exchange, which is the model followed by vast mayority of exchanges in the world (including stocks, derivatives, commodities and currencies). and most of these exchanges follow a practice that is somewhat similar to my suggestion: there is a prdefined tick value, and an order must be a multiple of that; the tick value is usually larger for more expensive products. (example: the price of us dollars is quoted as a 4-digit number vs. euro, but as a 2-digit number against jen. why? b/c a real eur/usd price is something like 1.2345 while a jpy/usd price is like 123.45).side note ends.and now finally, what the heck is it good for? as a direct consequence, when entering a market order, one can not beat the already existing best order with 1 cent, if he/she wants to achieve that, then has to under/ovebid by a meaningful amount. as a side effect, this in turn eliminates the 0.01 isk ""turf wars"", a nuisance for many of us, however this is not the point here (bet i can expect half dosen ""no supported"" from the cent-snipers, nonetheless :d). now imagine that many ppl want to sell the same thing, and quickly. now that can not be done with using the 1-cent exploit. if you want to be first is line, you have to settle for a bit smaller price. some will decide to accept that trdeoff, resulting in the ask (acronym for lowest sell order price) to sink. the same holds for the buy orders, and so the bid (highest buy order) will rise. even possible that both happens the same time if the bid/ask spread (difference beetween best buy and sell order price) was too large initially. this mechanics strongly works towards narrowing the bid/ask spread.now imagine that the market is in equlibrum and suddenly a sell pressure emerges. no time is wasted on the cent games as it would happen today, and so the ask price immediatly start sinking. as the b/a spread was already narrow, soon many seller will hit the bid instead of entering a sell order, and thus the whole market starts sinking until a new equilibrium is achieved (or even healthy panic/crash is possible). similar can happen - mutatis mutandis - in the case of a buy pressure (the extreme case here is the so-called bubble). this mechanics results in a market that reaacts faster to buy/sell imbalances and more voltile in genreal.continued..."
9/2/2009,"these two mechanics can (i expect they will) bring the following benefits:- smaller bid/ask spreads, i.e. better prices for each and any buyer and seller, including those hardcore pvp-ers who spit on such a carabear thingy as a market mechanics- markets that are more adaptive and react rapidly to changes in supply and demand- thus markets become more volatile, bigger differences between regions and time (significant intraday price fluctuation becomes possible)- resulting bigger geographical arbitrage possibilities and more variable prices in time enable new profession: the speculator- speculators generate more turnover as they trade, resulting in a much more liquid market - do not have to travel all the way to jita just to do your business (pun intended :d)- possibility for exciting, spectacular market events (crashes, bubbles) as seen in rl (educational purpose, anyone?)- who knows, maybe we develop our own notorious manipulators and robber barons in the end..."
9/2/2009,"this is a very good idea.market trading needs to kill off those 0.01 isk order undercutters.but i would suggest 4 digits of significant.i need to price my dreads at 1,495,000,000 for example.edit to support , you might wanna support your own topic too"
9/2/2009,not supported.because i like it when people fight over me for business.
9/2/2009,"drake, if you like figth for business, than you should rather support. the 1-cent game is for kids, real figth starts with bidding by the 100,000 :dbut really, the new rule would *force* those penny-pinching pretenders to put up a real fight or resign their place in the arena to a better gladiator."
9/2/2009,no... the solution is to get people to bid differently.forcing the issue is a waste of time.penny pinchers get stomped on by 10/100/1000 bidders easily... without the changes you propose.
9/2/2009,"i like this idea a lot, but i agree with gilbert when he says that the first four digits should be counted instead of just the first 3. in any case, supported."
9/2/2009,"drake: cant agree, in my experience if i am overbid by 0.01 and in reply i overbid by 10,000, in 5 mins my new order is overbid as well, guess what, by 0.01. however i do not really want to discuss the penny-pinching, as i stated, disabling this exploit is only a side-effect, not the main purpose of my suggestion."
9/2/2009,i like it
9/2/2009,"this. my trading has basically come down to running through all my market orders, not even checking what the sell price is, and lowering everything by a few dozen isk, because i know everyone else is doing the same thing.even if i make a significant undercut, someone will be right there ten seconds later undercutting me by a hundredth of an isk, so i might as well not undercut by any significant margin."
9/2/2009,"there another solution you know : sell your things in another place than jita.jita is for shark, but jita has the best price for seel and buy on immediate.if you want to place a bid :1) play thier game2) place the order in another systemwhen i want something quick i go to jitawhen i want to make profit with an order i go to another hubi'm not sure your idea is goodit's really dangerousas said someone will make a little bit less/more than you on a short timenot a problem for the market if it's 0.01 isk, but if it's 1% it's something else... 1% is a buseness for some trader, if they can't do it anymore, they will lost their gameyour idea is good for the buyer as it's quicker, and for a seller who want something quick, but for someone who want to play the order game, it's a real problem.sure i don't like when someone crash my order by 0.01 2mn later, but i don't like the one who set - 100 0000 isk 2h after.and with your rule the first one won't exist anymore, but the second will... and that's really dangerous.now :we can buy something on a place and sell it on atnoher at a best princewe can buy it at a place and sell it on the same at a best place... with patiencewith your ideathe first one will be more intersistingthe second one will be less intersitingso for people doing a lot of this, for example when doing something else at the same time (mining, lv4, or working mid afk) it's a big loss."
9/2/2009,"i've written the quoted one in at7 forum, but now i copy it here too.this could also make a place for more public sporting events, and possibly a new industry to grow out of this (like gambling, and/or advertising industry)... i mean, if it's done for the at, it could be rented out the whole year for corps/individuals to let them use for their purpose (whatever it is) or profit (however it is made).so what you say?"
9/2/2009,"as everyone knows, the current bounty system is pretty much a joke. players constantly exploit it by having their buddy / alt kill them and collect the bounty themselves. it's insult to injury for the players that they have griefed in the past.i propose to make it more difficult to exploit the system, that collecting a player bounty should require you to have a certain amount of positive security status. also, i believe there should be a ""bounty hunter"" skill/certificate that must be trained/obtained to collect a player bounty (leave rat bounties the way they are.) in order to obtain this skill/status, the player must have completed requirements to obtain ""civilian law enforcement status."" in addition, i would make it so that an unlawful attacking or killing of any ship in secured space results in immediate revocation of your law enforcement status and bounty payouts. also, if you pod any pilot anywhere in the game including 0.0 space, you lose your ability to collect bounty also, since concord does not approve of killing players even when they are wanted criminals. an unlawful ship killing results in the temporary suspension of your law enforcement status, and a pod kill / murder results in indefinite revocation unless you reach a sec status of +5.0 or higher and complete re-certification requirements.i think this feature / addition would make the bounty system more viable. of course it would still be flawed, people would still be able to create an alt and complete the requirements to collect their own bounty, however, it would make it more difficult to accomplish and it would give the rest of us a cool profession / hobby in bounty hunting. best of all, it will really make people think twice about the consequences of their actions. is it really worth it to pod kill someone if i wont be able to collect bounty in the future?i'm sure this topic is a dead horse, so my apologies if this a duplicate thread, but i feel strongly about this issue so i thought i would throw my hat in the ring.i would appreciate everyones thoughts / input / constructive criticism. im sure that this community will be able to build upon and improve this basic concept."
9/2/2009,"i've always thought the best way to make bounty hunting legitimate is to not let anyone but the bounty hunter know who has a bounty on their head. you give the capsuleers that have a certain number of qualifications (ala the op post) a bounty license, which lets them collect bounties. then, instead of the bounty window in station showing just the most wanted and give bounty tabs, it also shows a locator tab (similar to a locator agent) and a tab that shows all bounties in system and 1, 2, or 3 jumps out (depending on how much power you wanna give the bounty hunter).from then on it's a hunt for people who have no idea they're being hunted."
9/2/2009,"make it so the bounties are issued by an agent... the agent randomly assigns a player that is currently on-line and not docked that is in your region as your target for this mission.in the event that the players goes off-line, you will receive an evemail letting you know so you can stop trying to find him.this would prevent the current alt-abuse and make life a little more interesting."
9/2/2009,tradeable kill rights would fix 90% of this.
9/2/2009,"any t1 hull can be flown recklessly because of insurance, there is no meaning to losing a t1 ship. that in itself is flawed game design.wars of attrition are virtually impossible, thus making this no more than counter strike in space where endless respawns make the only way to kill another party to grief them out of the game or lower their morale.economical victory should be possible and would solve a lot of the problems in 0.0 warfare."
9/2/2009,"nah, platinum insuring that aeon would've meant i would've spent more isk on insuring it than what i would've gotten as a payout. remember you have to renew insurance every 3 months."
9/2/2009,"dude, wth is this? insurance does not pay enough! there is no replacement for the time it takes to get all the parts together and properly set up a ship. losing one out in the middle of nowhere can completely leave someone out to dry. even in high-sec, it can take a day sometimes just shopping for parts!ok i feel better now. :)if anything, make insurance more realistic, like having a car. in eve, have fees taken out of your wallet every month for each ship you have insured, based on a scale that adjusts for the class of ship."
9/2/2009,wowzers sooooo many numbers!how about ships are free and you just end up paying for mods
9/2/2009,fit a ship for 150mil and compare it to what you got for that last year -.-but let's see how far the rig intervention carries us. it's just another short-term remedy to distract from the static moon mineral supply yet again...
9/2/2009,yes high sec needs a buff! and low sec obviously needs a nerf!
9/2/2009,"campaigns have frequently been won and lost via repeated capfleet obliteration, showing that there is already plenty of room for victory via attrition.supercapitals are frequently held back from deployment because of the risk of severe loss. i'd rather not see the same apply to battleships. people generally want to fight each other, not hide in a pos unless they are really sure they can win.this is ignoring the fact that ships are the primary price support for t1 materials. t1 material does not have a fixed cost of procurement (unlike t2 material which at least needs tower fuel). value is demand-based, so removing insurance would drive the value of ships down tremendously, resulting in a massive depression of their price and t1 materials in the process."
9/2/2009,supported.battleships and even capitals are too cheap to lose.also i don't understand why everyone should be flying battleships anyways.
9/2/2009,"the only reason capital fleets are less easy to rebuild is the fact that the supply is way more limited because they're harder to build. and not many people insure their capitals, it simply gets too expensive because cap ships have too long life times. you can be pretty sure that you lose a battleship in 3 months if you play actively, so insuring it isn't a risk, it's a given.trit used to be 1 isk, pye 2 isk, mex 16 isk, iso 64 isk, nocx 128 isk, zyd 1024 isk and mega 4096 isk. things will balance out, it's actually capital ships which for a big part dictate mineral prices."
9/2/2009,not supported. its a bad plan.
9/2/2009,"i do not support this!insurance payouts allow players like me, who do not have the free time to spend 4 hours a day earning isk to activeley participate in pvp, factional warfare, and even 0.0 warfare.eve is a game which encourages people to scale fleetbattles in numbers.you are often faced with the fact that in a battle between dozens (sometimes hundreds of people) you loose assets in seconds. im talking about 150-200 million isk worth in ships, mods, and rigs.to afford this sort of participation you need either to earn isk in large numbers (time investment) or buy and sell multiple gtc a month, driving the monetary investment for playing eve up to a level people like me simply are not willing to spend. eve is a game and not a money / time sink. it should be easier to access and less time draining. thus allowing people to focus on having fun instead of wasting their time grinding missions for money."
9/2/2009,vagabond - 200mill rig+mods+shipinsurance = 17milli still fly everynighthappy?that i understand*******s total *******st2 fitted rupture = 25mill total 35mill with medium trimarks
9/2/2009,"don't fly what you cannot afford to lose. there's no-one forcing you to fly 200-250m worth into pvp.also, funnily enough, the ship you're trying to buy will be cheaper if there wasn't something like insurance."
9/2/2009,"what annoys me is people self destructing their carriers before the insurance runs out, and then they buy new carriers. its rediculous imo, it just ruins game mechanics for me."
9/2/2009,"true, losing a cheaply fit t1 ship doesnt hurt at all.would also be an indirect boost to t2 hulls, got my support."
9/2/2009,"no. eve is about pvp, and pvp should be viable to everyone. a fully insured raven with cap controls and a semi t2 fit is still going to be around a 60 million isk loss.tech ii insurance is already worthless, and good tech i ships already take up a decent amount of isk to fit properly.lowsec endeavors already became far less viable for new players, after the wcs nerf, we really don't need to take away their only silver lining when getting ganked for the zillionth time.and on top of that it isn't like people are just going to run more missions and get their ships blown up more often, they are going to keep their ships in highsec, stay away from pvp, and make the game more boring for all parties involved."
9/2/2009,kay... heres the sekrit gaiz1. get in the ship2. save the fitting3. get out of the ship4. ctrl + shift + f and open the fitting5. ???????????6. profit
9/2/2009,"110.44821002981 percent agree icing on the cake [/yummy] would be having the ability to at least remove mods this way. yes, repackaging can do this, but if i just want to use a weapon that i know is mounted on another ship, the session timer can be very annoying in this circumstance."

9/2/2009,so this is when your in station then right ! <-- obviousam i going to far if i request this while your in space so you know what your vict... enemy is equipped ? without using the ship scanner of course.p.s: last time i used this module i was disapointed.
9/2/2009,oh yesso i have 3 hauler on the region... which one are fitted ? need to go see it... not this one... *waiting* not this one...got a mission to do... but do i have the good fitting on the ship 10 jump away or do i have to buy some ? dunno...
9/2/2009,"why hasn't this been done yet?go, do."
9/2/2009,supported.
9/2/2009,"is there any reason we should not be able to fit assembled ships as well without boarding them? maybe even let us be able to autofit using a saved setup if all the needed modules are in our hanger? i don't know about these, but i fully support this."
9/2/2009,taking a stand against meaningless content injection! fix the bugs and bring back the epic font!
9/2/2009,"while at it, allow us to rename them as well.give us full access, if we have full access.(though i'm sure the answer will either be ""too much work"" or ""the holy database does not work this way"", as it's with blueprints...)"
9/2/2009,bump
9/2/2009,"i sorta agree but not enough. i don't know if 8% accross the board is right, possibly less. muninn ok with that change. ac ok. tempest bonus change no to the role bonus. it is a tech i ship. leave the slots as they are but maybe add one turret hardpoint, and make the falloff only affect arty, just as the apoc's optimal should be made to affect only beams, the rokhs only affect rails, and swap the mega's tracking bonus for a rail falloff bonus (increase tracking on blasters to compensate gallente and help cure the blaster boat problems). this will make the tier 2 battleships (except the raven, where the rokh swaps places) the snipers of each racial fleet. and, it would preserve the utility of the other tiers for the short range weapons and pvp, or missioning."
9/2/2009,"let me get this straigh, minnie ships that uses arty use no cap, can swap to any dmg type and now you want more dmg ?uhh no lmaop.s: did i miss something here ?"

9/2/2009,up for more tickage
9/2/2009,nerf cargo containers im sick off seeing*****some fother mucker is recruiting to a dumb corp that can't get player unless the leave 1mill can's out side hek*****now i'll go and read the rest of your post. rant over these should only be aloud in the the cargo hold packednothing stranger than a industral with 6000m3 space carring 8000m3 of stuff because he put it in a box. what happend to that extra 2000m3?not that is ^^^^^ /signed
9/2/2009,"so basically you want to increase your cargo capacity without any penalty (like in too lazy to open five containers and have to split the stuff).if you don't like the stack splitting, then just don't use them and live with the less capacity.so, no!btw.: you could have asked for faction cargo expander ... drichter, hauler-pilot."
9/2/2009,not supported...need a bigger can? get an orca.: o pyes the can system is screwed... but this makes it worse.
9/2/2009,do you enjoy stack splitting - stacking ?is it fun for you ?are there better things like umm.. i dunno pvp ? we could spend our precious ingame time on rather than d#cking around with cargo cans ?
9/2/2009,works for me.
9/2/2009,"i don't stack/split/or any of that crap.i have no problems here... i deal with what i got... and i don't ""exploit"" the gsc cargo can trick because i don't want to have to deal with the stupidity of ""stack splitting""i've always thought the way they did the cans with them taking up such and such space and providng ""more space"" than the can takes up was always screaming exploit to me.this just makes it worse."
9/2/2009,"ive pondered this in circles many times myself... mostly while moving my 5+ rigged and fitted battleships 25+ jumps. moving my ship hangar takes 3 days, moving my items about 30 minutes with a crappy skilled badger mk2what ive come up with is a ship transport or whatever it would be called that can only hold sub capital ships, only unload and load in stations/directly from ship maint arrays. being able to carry 6-8 battleships should be more than enough to satisfy anyone with a ship collection really... for storyline's sake, it can be developed by interbus or something... cause really we dont need 4 versions of the same ship, just one made by a neutral party.seeing this ship put into the game would make me infinitely happy to train for and buy."
9/2/2009,"i agreeif ccp don't want us to use capital as freighter, they need to give us something else.at least a big thing in 0.5+capital industrial ship are only for ore now, why not creating one as a real industrial ship ?or change something existing, i don't carea t3 module is an idea ; like a version for cargo and another for assembled shipeven if it's expensive, it will sell well in empire space at least"
9/2/2009,"a ship called the ""mobile deployment transport""for highsec, it can move around your craploads of ships. for null/lowsec, it can be used to unleash a crapload of bs, and then when yourr bs explode, get back in another one. it would add a whole new dimension to warfare."
9/2/2009,"with a limit on the total number of ships that can be carrier.so that when you get suicided the server does not explode.so 15 ship limit and teh bay size you choose, cant carry capitals./me gets t1 fitted raven and 15 corpies in same."
9/2/2009,"i was actually thinking that since the ships you're transporting are rigged onto the hull of the ship (so's that they don't move), that they are all wrecked along with your ship when you get blown up."
9/2/2009,"this imply an important change : the limitation of 3900 m2 will deseapear.it's important for example when hauling big modules (like pos structure), cause we can't use container with then, and we lost a lot of space.i'm for, but dunno if ccp will accept allowing that"
9/2/2009,sounds like fun (more fun than managing containers that is).

9/2/2009,"this would not work for freighters unless the volume of capital ships is increased, because as it stands any freighter would be able to haul a packaged dreadnought or carrier into highsec given a small percentage boost in cargo storage.or freighters could just be excluded from the cargo boost."
9/2/2009,"yeah fon, my week long discussion amounted in being told that in order to avoid losing a ship to this (im calling it exploit out of logic and ccp's very own definition seen here) i had to stay docked, and potentially log off for several hours... which even then didnt garuantee my safety. i learned after the fact that there was a neutral party killing the rats in my mission to generate wrecks for the gankers to aggress.for extra clarity, this is what ccp's exploit defenition is:ive also heard that using known exploits is a bannable offense. with the help of a friend we found a post of a dev stating that the context in which i was killed is a known exploit. i was told that the dev was simply ""misinformed"" although we searched for and didnt find any evidence of the contrary.bumping to give this a chance of being looked at by devs and fixing an important issue that everyone gets snagged on at least once."
9/2/2009,this is clearly an exploit : o pa possible solution is to get concord'd for shooting someone else's wrecks but i'm quite sure that would go over really well like a lead balloon.well you get concord'd for shooting a friggen rock in a mission so why not keep to the same wacky train of thought?ps: no it wasn't me... member of my corp set off a smartbomb in mission and got concord'd for nailing a rock... it was funny as hell but not so funny after you think about the stupidity of it all.
9/2/2009,ha ha ha i know what you mean!
9/2/2009,"i remember hearing that shooting a wreck to update aggression was an exploit something like two years ago, now its an intended game mechanic? i never knew someone shooting one of your wrecks updates gcc timer too, thats even more messed up."

9/2/2009,"hi all,ok - just *what* is the point of the csm?there's a thread going on in the assembly hall regarding the competence of gms and the seeming failures of the petition system. it's over 350 posts long yet ccp feel able to not bother with any form of official response.there are multiple threads going on the the issues, workarounds and localization forum regarding people bringing hack attempts on their accounts to ccp. they subsequently get locked out of their accounts for weeks on end and are left high and dry by ccp in the meantime with not a single scrap of feedback on their issue while still being charged for the ""privilege"".ccp seem, from the lack of an official response to these threads, to feel able to ignore these threads too.so just what *is* the csm doing about this and *can* they do anything about this seeming endemic failure within ccp?or is the csm simply a tipping of the hat towards player concerns about eve while nothing *actually* gets resolved?"
9/2/2009,it's purposed is to generate some press interest and act as a lightning rod for forums whining.
9/2/2009,"there have been some changes that were made because of the advent of the csms, i think the most recent was the faction warfare lp payouts. so, yeah, from time to time ccp does listen to them.sometimes though, you'll have a dev in the ccp group that will not for the life of them will see things the players way and have often sabotaged various attempts to get things through. add to that, csms just wanna play the game too and stuff can get dropped. or, as what happens in real politics, you sometimes vote in an idiot."
9/2/2009,when is the next csm meeting?
9/3/2009,"cerb can get 550 dps from 0 to 41km with heavy assaults and kinetic rage. or it can do 440dps with any other damage type.deimos can get 635dps at 3.4 optimally and can hit out to 8.1 with falloff or it can do 499dps at 4.9 with a max range of 17.6 (not even half of the cerbs range)to that, the diemos has to consider tracking and only 2 damage types.the one saving grace the deimos has is it's drones, which can add another 158dps tops if you've trained those skills also, but can be shot down, smart bombed, lost and forgotten or whatever else. deimos has to give up 3 slots in it's tanking zone to do that damage.cerb has to give up 3 slots not in it's tanking section.explain to me where the problem is with those 2 ships.2 unique platforms that complement each other with strengths and weaknesses.missles fill a role, part of that role is racial kinetic damage for certain ships. live with it."
9/3/2009,"so who should be the one complaining? i could care less about 'combat ranking' i play eve to shoot stuff and be shot at. as i've said on just about every other buff thread- quit f*cking whining and play the game. this forum is here for game development ideas- not rebalances. while i salute ccp for coming up with the idea for the csm, i want to slap them for succumbing to the 80,000 whiners posting thread after thread asking for their race to be buffed.shut the hell up and play the game."
9/3/2009,"my response to that would be: i would still put my money on the deimos. 3 possible situations in a 1v1 (which almost never happens anyway)cerb tackles deimos -> deimos is already in tackle range and counter tackles -> deimos wins due to higher dps assuming same e-hp, tanking, and all lvl 5 skillsdeimos tackles cerb -> deimos in optimal and does higher dps -> cerb tries to run and cannot due to bieng tackled by deimoscerb at optimal and engages deimos -> deimos warps out due to no tackle at that big of a range -> cat and mouse game ensues with either pilot getting blown up, or logging due to boredom side note: why are we arguing about 2 different ships? different stratagies and gang tactics to both of them. caldari and gallante pitted against eachother, as always."
9/3/2009,"i agree that kinetic missiles being the only bonus on caldari ships sucks, but what you are proposing is not the way to fix the issue. a more reasonable solution would be for missiles to have more than one damage type. for example, a missile can deal 25% kinetic and 75% damage specific, giving kinetic missiles 100% kinetic damage. this would keep caldari the kinetic race, but also allow for a more uniform damage increase. that is the only solution i can see for an issue such as this."
9/3/2009,"i want amarr ships to fire explosive, kinetic and thermal (more of it) laser beams!!!!!111!!111 seriously, missiles do not have a optimal range and you can drive right up the face of another ship and torp it to death. or cruise him from afar, even with my ****ty missile skills, my cruisies can reach out and smack someone at 200km+ or come close and torp them at <30km.on top of hitting your target 24/7 with no minimal range and a range my apocalypse struggles to match is the flexibility that missiles offers. what's that? he's down to armour? switch to expl or kin or therm or em.gallente, minmatars and amarr are restricted to exp, therm/kin, em/therm. caldari has access to all 4 with amazing range and no tracking.wishing his abaddon can shoot explosive and kinetic laser beams, stormie."
9/3/2009,if you think missiles currently need this buff do us a favour and go fly a missile boat or even better get on the wrong end of one.
9/3/2009,"no.because that would mean i always ""have"" to take all missle-damage-types with me and test what dmg type is the best ... would take too long in a pvp-scenario.with bonus to one dmg-type i just carry 2 or max 3 dmg types with me. and i at least get the feeling that although kinetic may not be the best, it's not the worst either because of dmg-bonus.also, every race is somehow predictable what damagetype they'll deal. from a megathron i only expect kinetic and thermal, from zealot em and thermal, vagabond mostly explosive ... and from caldari it's kinetic. but while the other races have to stick with their damagetype, caldari can switch to something different.if u want to change something about caldari weapons, complain about rockets."
9/3/2009,"while i do not agree with the op, i found this very interesting:perhaps not balanced in the way suggested here, but more flavour to the different types of missiles sounds awesome."

9/3/2009,not supported.
9/3/2009,"you say you carry 2 , 3 damage types ? your happy that you lose your damage bonus when you switch ammo ? when this doesnt happen to any other ship than a caldari missile boat ?"
9/3/2009,"i fly all races , i'd like to fly cmb's but i cant because they have bonuses which are incompatible with there combat tactics."
9/3/2009,i can and do fly khanid.it doesnt solve the problem that cmb's have damage bonuses incompatible with there combat tactics.
9/3/2009,"your completelly missing the point.this is not about ship x verus ship ythis is about player x versus player ywhere player y has trained level 5 and player x has only trained level 1take a caracal as an example.put 2 pilots against one another.all other skills and mods are equal.player x has caldari cruiser 2 , player y has caldari cruiser 5who wins that fight ?youd think it should be player y who has done 20 days extra training, but thats not so its actually a draw as they both have to use em missiles. so nither is fighting with a damage bonus.this only happens with cmb's.the damage bonus is not compatible with the combat tactic.all other races ships that get damage bonuses allways benifit from those bonus."
9/3/2009,"this is not about ship x versus ship y. read the op.you talk about damage switching as and advantage.yet tou fail to comprehend that a level 5 pilots does not more damage than a level 1 pilot when ""the advantage"" is used.sacs are not overpowered , even though they get double damage bonus to all damage types.why do you think it would make a caracal or cerb overpowered ?"
9/3/2009,"the stupidest example is the kestrel (and the inquisitor and breacher) which gets a 10% kinetic bonus and a 5% bonus to the other damage types, meaning you can never take advantage of both hull bonuses at once! but yeah, it does suck that a bunch of caldari missile ships only get one of their bonuses while using a particular ammo type. imagine if the megathron only got its hybrid damage bonus while it was using uranium rounds, or if the geddon's rate of fire bonus only worked with standard crystals loaded. seeing as the supposed advantage of missile launchers is the ability to swap out damage types, its silly to force the player to sacrifice a hull bonus to do so. its like arguing that amarr players do have the ability to do variable damage types after all because they can always choose to take off the lasers and fit artillery!"
9/3/2009,"flawed analogy. anyway, you appear to not have experienced the wonders of the 10% reduction in cap use on lasers or the piddly 5% rof bonus on the deep in torpor arty which basically make the weapons useable at level 4 and sorta ok at level 5. so you see other races are stuck with one meaningful bonus as well. additionally, you appear to not have read the entire thread.again flawed analogy. you can't in the middle of a battle ask everyone to wait while you dock up and swap guns instead of simply reloading your already fit launchers."

9/3/2009,sucky game mechanic
9/3/2009,"yes, when there are things you can do to the same effect. take my issue for an example. you try to hunt a ratter in an empty system. the moment you jump into the system you have a few seconds to locate him before he is safe from aggression. even then he will very likely escape, if he pays attention. it was already very hard to catch him. as a forum ***** you notice the lack of any whines about how overpowered the scanner was. i for one can't think of a single one.please tell me how to adapt? i can't train a skill to do it faster. i can't use a different fitting or a ship, since they are all equally bad. no implants or rigs will help me. the only thing that i could do was to try and learn to how to scan the target down faster by training my real life skills. ccp has now put a hardcap on this, that i have no way of compensating for. the competition between target and prey was between time and it favored the prey already. ccp just decided it wasn't easy enough for them and didn't allow other ways of achieving the same result, so there isn't a way to adapt to the change. the only option is to have them change it to something more reasonable, so it doesn't affect gameplay so much, but still prevents constant spam of the scanner. this thread is full of acceptable compromises."

9/3/2009,"public petition to take back the spanish tutorials.when apocrypha expansion was deployed at begins of 2009 the spanish tutorials (and some other already translated tutorials) stoped working. some days ago, we started to send petitions protesting for this issue, and the answer that we received was that this isn't an issue, that ccp doesn't support non-offical languages. after that, they encouraged us to write a public petition on the forums... so, here it is.we want that ccp bring back us all the spanish tutorials that we had before the apocrypha expansion. first thing i would like to say is that we are not after a spanish client, we are only after the spanish tutorials. spanish is the 3rd more spoken language in the world. ccp is a company, and we are almost sure they deeply studied this and if they decided to don't make a full translation they will have its reasons. but we don't think that translating the tutorials would be a huge issue since they were translated before. the first question that new spanish people do is if the tutorials are translated and lot of them are discouraged to continue playing when they find tutorials are not translated.there are some spanish communtys trying to cover this hole. and would be a huge help if ccp supported us a bit since we are ready to help ccp in all we can in this aspect.note: this is not a discussion thread, this is only a petition. you can find a discusion thread about this here discusion threadthanks for your attention,tokp lotas"

9/3/2009,/signed
9/3/2009,"here are my personal initial thoughts. changes should be gradual so you can look back and fully grasp the direct and indirect affects of a change. some of these are too steep and conveniently leaves out factors that do benefit matar. i think a slight nerf to amarr would be of more value as they got the ships with stats so out of whack.all autocannons: +35% falloff. hit quality reduces the damage at optimal + falloff to 38.6%, tracking independent. this is a very steep loss of damage and ambits are practically manditory on every ac ship just to get decent damage.- so a straight up 35% falloff increase? so my vaga can then hit from outside point range and still do pretty good damage. would have to see a graph to compare it with other race weapons, but seems a little overpowered.tiered falloff: keep the falloff the same for the middle tiered autocannons. reduce the falloff of the lower tier by 10%, increase the falloff of the upper tier by 10%. - you do currently have an incentive of 5% increase damage. maybe take tracking penalty off then you will see more people switch between the different tiers. so on top of the 35% you want another 10% i am guessing for tier 3? would have to see this in comparison to others (factoring tracking, cap usage, ammo bonuses, and ammo types)artillery: increase the base damage modifier by 50%. compensate by increasing the rate of fire by 50% as well. this gives artillery a bit of it's bite back, but not all of it. increase clip size by 50% as well. finally, increase optimal by 10% across the board. the result is a higher alpha but the same dps, and a little bit less pain from reloading. - so you want a 10% increase in optimal on top of the tempest optimal bonus? couple that with a 50% alpha increase on guns that take no cap and have a nice falloff compared to the other guns? the tempest: increase speed and agility by 15%. change the bonuses as following: damage bonus to 10% per level, 5% falloff per level. this gives it a little bit of seperation from the maelstrom which currently overshadows it in nearly every role. it makes the tempest a much better pirate boat and gives it a good anti-support role while staying mobile. it has the option of sitting nice and close with a large alpha from artillery, or being a mobile autocannon and neutralizer machine. it will still suffer from a confused mid/low slot configuration, so it won't be the next gank/tank battleship like the mega or geddon. it will actually lose dps in favor for some true versatility.- so 25% falloff increase plus the 10% increase you want to give guns? the tempest does have 2 utility slots so it can quickly turn into an rr/neut bs without any sacrifice of slots and it has the unused cap to use them. why not just have a total of 2-3 bs in the game as they are all turning the same.the muninn: move a highslot to a midslot. utility highslots don't belong on sniper hacs, nevermind two of them. increase speed and agility by 10%. combined with the artillery changes, i think it will be just fine. it may not reach the dps/tracking of the zealot, but it will have a seperate damage type and be faster and more agile. there is no reason why the amarr hac should be faster than the minmatar hac.- hmm. this one i am on the fence with. we have 2 utility plus drones that are both useless for a sniper. i would almost be fine taking away a utility plus the drones for a mid. the one extra utility could possibly be used for a neut (though you won't have grid for it)the typhoon: switch armor and shield. give it some more fitting room (+1000 pg/40 cpu)- more grid would be nice (i would be willing to make drone bay smaller for it). and then a double dmg bonus for just one of the weapon types (missile or arty) (like you did with the naglfar)."
9/3/2009,"that doesn't make any sense. ""don't increase my base range, i don't want to have to fit rigs to increase my range."" ??why do blasters get a falloff increase and not autocannons? also remember that falloff is only about 38.5% as strong a mechanic as optimal. the tempest does not have an optimal bonus, nor is astro calling for one. even with his proposed changes, artillery will still be the shortest long range weapon. his tempest proposal actually lowers its dps, below its already lowest-in-class dps. i'm against his tempest-specific changes, but for different reasons. i support the rest.still far, far less than the 90km optimal you get with an apoc using pulse lasers.no, he means give it more armor than shield. right now, it has 7 lowslots and more shield than armor - a very confused ship. it doesn't have the grid for an active armor tank either... but i feel the phoon is pretty decent already.---given these clarifications, would you support his changes?"
9/3/2009,"i updated my post and where i do support the changes i noted it. i don't support all of it (especially all at one time). though, if you did get this all in, it would definitely benefit me."

9/3/2009,"supported, although im thinking arty may need something more... the increase in alpha will help artillery instapop things, but will only be helpful if instapopping things. and even with 10% more optimal they will still be the shortest range and have by far the worst tracking. for sniping against targets that you know you can not kill in one volley, artillery would be even worse besides for the much needed optimal boost"
9/3/2009,supported
9/3/2009,"the intent wasn't to make them a better fleet weapon, the intent was to give them more of a role in small gang combat where they excel while keeping around the same performance in a fleet. the optimal nudge plus the falloff bonus of the pest will make it a little easier to use arties in a fleet setting, but the big change is small gang and hit and run mechanics. i want people to say ""oh ****"" when they see 4 tempests sitting on a gate. right now it's ""lol""."
9/3/2009,"i don't know what you call ""pretty good damage"" as the vaga has mediocre to poor damage at optimal. i'd love to include some graphs but i don't really have the tools necessary. the falloff increase would make the graph look somewhat like the eft graphs. currently eft graphs don't account for hit quality, so a 33% boost would make more or less identical.other guns have scaling optimal and damage, i don't see why minmatar should get the shaft here. another 10% ontop of the 35% proposed is very little when considering dps at range, honestly. that's what, a single ambit? the equivalent of a 3-4% boost in optimal if my math serves me right.yes. you fail to note the abysmal dps, optimal, rof, fitting reqs among other things.i don't know what you're talking about here. the proposed change will actually make it do less damage than before (9 effective turrets vs 10), but instead give it a larger alpha and some extra range. it will continue to be paper thin with a crap medium/low config, low sensor strength, low lock range and other things. it will basically turn into an oversized bc.i think the bonuses and slots are fine, and will be fine especially if the changes applicable to autocannons go through."
9/3/2009,"signed, minnies need some fresh air as it's getting kind of musty and dank inside our old rust buckets. some caveats though: i don't see the need to reduce the minnie long range ammos damage (carbonised lead, titanium sabot, proton etc), since they are about the only counter that minnies have in long range engagements with caldari, for instance (unless you want to really use tremor, which wasn't even mentioned here, because just about no one uses it because its dps is so anemic).personally, i don't like the arty rof changes either. what arties need are better optimal, higher rof and bigger clip sizes. (and they'll still be worse than either missiles or lasers at long range)but the rest of the proposals, yes."

9/3/2009,i pleaded for this when they announced the change to stasis webifiers in the feedback thread. supported.
9/3/2009,"gods yes... the speed nerf was needed badly, but the changes to webs completely gimped pretty much every ship when trying to hold a target at all. it completely castrated the minmatar specialized ships (hyena, huginn, rapier). it also rendered one of the paladin's bonuses completely pointless.as it stands now i can lock a fleeing interceptor at 20km, and it can still run out of web range (even overloaded webs) long before it slows down appreciably (that's 35km of running away while triple webbed and still outrunning an mwd fit hug/rap)."
9/3/2009,i like tiramisu.

9/3/2009,fix it please
9/3/2009,"easy to supportalso remove the killmails where the top damage dealer did all the damage, and everyone else did 0"
9/3/2009,"not really. a hac can do certain things a lot better. for example, the muninn or zealot will always be better at anti support and kiting than any battleship of battlecruiser, becuase they are smaller, faster, more maneuverable and possess a dps parity to battleships against smaller targets. my muninn would at the moment probably cost me (including fittings) about the same as my fleet tempest did. for that i get a ship with considerably more utility and as much dps, that is nominally less likely to survive an engagement (due to ehp differences). you could easily ask why use a titan when you have jump bridges or commandships or fleets of battleships or whatever. the answer would be the same; the shinier ship is genuinly more useful in certain circumstances."
9/3/2009,and apparently it's not working well enough for the original poster.i actually use that mechanic quite a bit; more than you it seems.
9/3/2009,"why? what are you trying to solve? someone mentioned nap's - well...aren't those your allies? so really what you want to be able to do is shoot at people your alliance has decided are off limits for shooting at.if you don't like it, leave the alliance. then you/they can shoot them/you all day long.or, and this is just me blue skying here, fly a little further from home and shoot some people that aren't blue. this mecahnic isn't broken - you're just not happy with the target selection."
9/3/2009,seriously... if you don't like it.. go fly off into some distance 0.0 space full of reds or nuets and blow im to hell.problem solved.
9/3/2009,posting in a caod thread
9/3/2009,this came from someone in the nc? o.osupport for the madness it would make in eve
9/3/2009,"seems everyone wants to talk on the penny-pinching. ok, i yield in lots of cases, yes, but far from always. first, pennying is a phenomenon not limiteted to jita. second, some items have a usable market only in jita. anyway, if you check my op posts, you can see that among the expected positive effects i listed improved market liquidity, which will probably help with the second issue.and let me reiterate, my proposal is not aimed to simply eliminate penny-piching.i dont think it works this way. imo, the main issue here is how many orders are inserted into the line before yours, and their exact price is less important. the competitor who is willing to underbid by 100 000 will underbid you, no matter what (the only difference is that now he may choose to do so by only 0.01, wich will change). however, the competitor who is not willing to really underbid, just wants to jump the queue, will no longer be able to do so. at the end of the day, it means less orders unerbidding you (however some of those will in fact have considerably lower price).but just the opposite is true for the second one (i.e. an attmept of selling the same place at a better price)! i agree that narrower bid/ask spread menas that you can earn less if you are playing market maker (i.e. if you try to buy at the bid and sell at the ask). however recall, that the markets are expected to become more volatile: larger price fluctuation and swings will be on order. you dont play such a market by trying to sell at ask level (and check back in every 5 minutes if you have been underbid). you enter your sell order on a higher but realistic level and dont care to be the best seller - you wait for the market to cometo you. as it flucuates rapidly, changes are, it will do and soon. this way you pocket more money with each winning trade, not less."
9/3/2009,so basically you want to increase the cost of bumping in front of the queue. i have no issues with .01 market warriors it decreases the cost of bumping myself in front of them when i tweak my sell orders. as a related question why are you calling that an exploit?
9/3/2009,"tellenta, your question cuts to the point. what i intend to increase, is the effect caused on the market by the event of someone bumping the queue. true that it also increases the cost of bumping (or i'd rather say that from now on it *would* have a cost), and while not the main purpose, i consider the elimination of 0.01 under/overbidding (aka penny-pinching) as a beneficial side effect. i readily admit that pennying is not declared officially to be an exploit, that is only my personal jugment based on the argument below (which you may or may not accept):if your order is the best in the order book, that means it is the first in line, and so the first one that gets filled when a matching immediate transaction is initiated by someone. so you can be more certain that you can make the deal at that price, and it also will take less time - these advantages clearly have economic value. as a basic priciple, to gain something valuable you are required to give something in return (""there is no such thing as a free luch"" is almost a mantra in some schools of economics ). indeed, in this case, you are expected to pay by offering a better price, i.e. forfeiting a portion of your profit. however the system mechanics allows you to under/overbid by whatever amount. when cutting price by 0.01, you take advantage of this mechanics in order to gain something valuable for practically free, and in my book that constitutes for an exploit."
9/3/2009,"just 1 bump for this thread... i wasn't aware it was such a lousy idea, but perhaps someone will answer: yes it is! :d"
9/3/2009,"i'm pretty sure the only broadcasting of the tourneys these days is on youtube. that's not exactly suited to what you had in mind. it's an interesting idea, but i expect it to be quite a lot of work, and i'm not sure the end result would be a big improvement over just having someone fraps it."
9/3/2009,"wow,where to begin. ever tried to fit a caldari ship for damage before ? if you did, i'm pretty sure you had trouble. not enough pg to fit that last weapon slot right... without sacrificing that low slot for an rcu or a pds to get it online. if you did fit it with an rcu or something similar..well you guessed it, you made it less useful in some way.i dont think i need to go in details but caldari ships really need more pg. im pretty sure the caldari community will benefit from that change.advantage : - more pg = usually more dps which caldari ship is not really good for now.- more pg = more usefulness for low slots (more dmg mods ;)instead of using it for an rcu.- people will probably be using more caldari ships a bit more useful since it can fit some real weapons lol.- pirates will have a good challenge now and will stop laughing p.s: i can feel the flame coming lol"
9/3/2009,"i have a hard time accepting your argument that caladari ships are weak in general when the most popular mission running ship in the game is a caldari battleship.""fill all the high slots with guns and shoot anything that moves"" isn't a strategy, contrary to popular belief."
9/3/2009,train up engineering.../me not supporting epic fail thread
9/3/2009,1. you are too unspecific.2. not all fits should work without fitting mods.and i dont have any issues to fit all my caldari ships without any fitting mods so far.not supported. try to make more specific proposals.
9/3/2009,"4 turrets, 4 missile slots. 5% rof boni to both.fair enough ccp has a hardon for split weapons on minmatar ship as they are at least in theory flavoursome as 'versatile'; which is dev speak for outperformed in any specific role by other ships in the game and requiring more sp invested to even hope to compete!the problem comes when we consider that you effectively get half the benefit from any damage mods you fit compared to any other battleship.this topic always generates replies from eft warriors, if you dont fly tyhpoons please dont venture an opinion as to why the typhoon is fine as it is already.the clever chappie that does the qen expressed suprise as to abysmal phoon sales compared to all other bs. people that play this game and fly minmatar know why this is the case.i would like to propose:either,changing the boni on the ship to 7.5% rof per level for both weapons, compensating for the issues with damage mods.orgiving the typhoon a 5% damage bonus to large proj (which already have a high fire rate) and 5% rof to cruise/torps. then giving it 8 missile hardpoints and 8 turret hardpoints.let people choose how to fit it- really choose."
9/3/2009,"first, for the love of god, it's bonuses, not boni.that aside, there's not much reason to change the typhoon - it's an adequate ship.(and yes, i fly one). i don't pvp in it, but then, i don't pvp anyway, so that's no real surprise. i do run level 4 missions in it, and haven't ever looked at my screen in horror wondering why the ship was failing abysmally. it works well for my style of flying and play.perhaps the problem is not the ship, but that that particular ship does not fit well with the way you play and/or fly. and i mean that with no saracasm or mal intent. we all fly differently - some more agressive, some more defensive, some favor tank, some favor dps, speed, resists, what have you. the real problem may be that the typhoon just isn't the ship for you - nothing wrong with that. but it works just fine for me, so i see no rason to change it when there are a 11 other t1 battleships in the game to fly."
9/3/2009,"i personally love the typhoon and the challenges of fitting one i think are just part of it's character. you can do some very effective setups with it. all that being said- it's a teir 1 battleship! i do not believe it is in proper balance with the other teir1 ships. it requires entirely too many sp to fly effectively to be a starter bs. i think any changes made to it however need to be very minimal. otherwise it will either become way overpowered or just completely non-interesting and fun anymore. i think that maybe a 6/6 highslot layout would be more balanced and would still give it two utility slots. i support a ""re-evaluation"" of the balance of the typhoon compared to the other teir1 battleships and the sp needed to make it effective."
9/3/2009,"while this topic is new, exiting and isn't already well discussed, i will still comment to object to the 8 omni slots solution. even a 5/5 or 6/6 would be preferable, since it would still maintain the flavor of the phoon. but i would prefer this issue looked at as part of the whole minmatar package. you tend to get better long term result, if you step back and look at the big picture before starting to make individual changes to existing ships."
9/3/2009,this.<---typhoon pilot/thread
9/3/2009,"not supported. it needs minor fixes at most. see the large projectiles/tempest discussion for my proposed changes. even those are wishful, it's quite a decent ship as it stands."
9/3/2009,the geddon also has only 5% rof bonus. let's boost that too.
9/3/2009,"i'm going to be a bastard and sign both this and astro's other proposal. the 6/6 high slot chage to the phoon would be a very good start (but only atart, mind you, as the other issues raised are very important to minnies). remember, this is serious business!"
9/3/2009,not supported.typhoons already rock as is. maybe you just lack skills?
9/3/2009,ok so big battle happens. people use faction ammo. the fed navy antimatter stacks back up nicely and gets back on the market. faction crystals on the otherhand are damaged and cant be put back on the market. so there is a large amount of waste happening.the xl crystals are far worse because there is no amarr navy crystals. thusly there is no mission runner supply of them. so there is practically no faction ammo for revelations.barring any issue relative to if the revelations need the faction ammo or not.proposal: be able to stack them... say you have 20 crystals all damaged to 50%. when stacked you could have 10 crystals at 100%or simply introduce amarr navy xl so that supply can be produced?
9/3/2009,faction ammo is not the only thing in the whole damn game.there's standard ammo for crying out loud.is it such a bad thing to be forced to use standard ammo?
9/3/2009,all xl ammo are limited to pirate factions. not just crystals.

9/3/2009,"it's unusual to say the least for a t1 ship to get this sort of bonus, but it is not without precedent, though the other example that comes to mind is a faction ship (nightmare). despite that, this is a very elegant solution to the tempest problem. proposed tempest changes supported."
9/3/2009,not supportedi agree with almost all ipod said.
9/3/2009,"so the idea is to introduce a new shiptype with frigate or destroyer sized hull (i particulary love destroyer hulls and would very love a new one with that size :) ) with sole purpose of intercepting and tackling fleeing enemies.my brief suggestions :*ship should have a warp speed which is significantly higher than any other ship*ship should have moderate combat cabalities (corvette < assault ships , corvette < interdictors , corvette > t1 frigs , corvette > t1 destroyers , corvette = interceptors ? ) *ship should have good tackling capabilities (maybe a minor bonus for warp scrambling or stuff like that),!!no bubbles!!*there is no need for this ship to be faster than t2 frigates on regular speeds ( basically its purpose is to gain advantage while warping and wait for the enemy on the other end of the warp tube, where enemy has a chance to escape with regular drive if he is faster)what do ya think?p.s: mostly i'm interested in a ship with such capabilities either than this particular name or ship hull,so even if it would be just a new tier of t2 interceptors = its fine."
9/3/2009,"so, it's basically another interceptor?with current warp mechanics high warp speed is nearly useless as acceleration and deceleration take up most of the warp time"
9/3/2009,actually t2 frigs are not that fast these days. and having a dessy on steoriods with tackling and guns.you do realise that it'll die to quick to make use of that tackling bonus?i'd suggest td bonuses insteadt2 dessy that wreak havoc to gunships <3
9/3/2009,"in irl navies, the corvette is a bit smaller than a frig, which makes it faster and more maneuverable. which just gave me an idea, what if motherships can fit corvettes in it's drone bay as a sort of ""interdictor"" drone with warp and bubbling abilities to stop other ships from warping/cynoing off? you could assign them just like fighters but they have a bigger tank and stronger guns. it wouldn't be filling any missing role shipwise, but it'd be really neat to know they're warping constantly towards the fleeing bogey wherever it goes in system, it'd give motherships a huge role as defenders of whole star systems.oh, and to make them op, give them the availability to hold names and become warp-in points for the rest of the fleet."
9/3/2009,ain't current interceptors already filling that role ?
9/3/2009,here's the real problem with this idea.we already have a ship class that does what you're looking for. there's no reason to add a second one.
9/3/2009,"no support.you're trying to introduce a redundant, non-nonsensical role.also, bad nomenclature: a corvette is smaller than a frigate, which is smaller than a destroyer."
9/3/2009,"i admit, i would like to see a corvette class ship, but not as a intercepter clone.i always pictured it being something like a t2 newbie frigate or t2 shuttle that is designed as a courier boat. something along the lines of the interbus shuttle. a little more cargo room, fast align, fast velocity, fast warp speed, t2 resists, maybe a bonus against scramming, but that would be about it."
9/3/2009,"take medium ammo for examplerange bonus laser/hybrid projectile0% - 16dmg - 16 dmg-25% - 20(+25%) - 20 fusion (+25%)-37.5% - 22 (+37.5%) - 20 plasma (+25%)-50% - 24 (+50%) - 22 emp (+37.5%)why? zealot/eagle was boosted +20% damage (1 turret was added) it put them in line with minmatars on long range and give advantage in close, but minmatar ships stay same. minmatar ships with autocannons almost always fight on faloff so never deliver 100% damage, minmatar ships with artileries lose to other race in damage with close range ammo. how about to put them in line with others?"

9/4/2009,"this is less a issue on how the things should be and more a issue of ""i don't use missile anyway because i pvp so let them be as they always were"" this thread is not about boosting missiles, is about ship bonuses and the worthiness of training that to level 5.anyhow supporting or sending the supporter back to missions ain't changing nothing. ccp has a history of implementing changes that were never proposes by the players and complete ignoring others with tens of pages of support posts."
9/4/2009,"i support this if i get crystals with kinetic/explo damage.seriously, kinetic is not a bad damage to deal, and you still have the option to switch ammo type. being amarr, your limited to em/thermal."
9/4/2009,"again you are crying on the tune of: ""fix the game to dav varan combat tactics, dav varan should not adapt his tactics to different ships and weapon systems""."
9/4/2009,if the op is after parity with other races then the solution is to replace kinetic damage bonus with a generic damage bonus. then remove all missile types except kinetic.simples!
9/4/2009,"i do not find any problem with the damage emphasis on missile ships. it is even more intresting this way, and does not stop me from using these ships, like some ships that suffer from broken weapon systems for real. (rockets, projectiles)no. they do less raw dps to compensate for the lack of tracking, range and cap issues. (hell, you could throw in even locking issues) kinetic emphasis compensates for that missile ship can choose its damage type.missiles have so many inherent advantages that you, who never flew other ships, forget that other ships usually have bonii just to try and cover up for these issues.yeah, make drake even better than the best solo pvp bc (with all of these winning 4) out there and i will have to stop flying it, just to not look uncool flying obviously the best ship of its class. argue if you want, but i am more happy with drake than other bc's. (yes, i know that sounds like ""but you have vaga!"", but so what. it always works against minnies.)"
9/4/2009,"to bring about parity , one of two things should happen.either no races should have racial damage bonuses orall races should have racial damage bonuses.there is no parity atm.i went through and counted the ships that have racial damage bonusesthere are 18 caldari ships with racial bonuses3 gallente ships with racial bonuses2 minmatar ships with racial bonuses2 amarr ships with racial bonuses.rof & damage to guns are not racial bonuses.lasers do em/thermal , thermal is not amarr racial damage type , yet amarr get 5% bonus to this damage type through rof & straight damage bonuses.hybrids do thermal/kinetic , kinetic is not gallente racial damage type , yet gallente get 5% bonus to this damage type through rof & straight damage bonuses.projectile do all damage types depending on ammo loaded. em/thermal and kinetic are not minmatar racial damage type , yet minmatar get 5% bonus to em/thermal/kinetic through rof and damage bonii.drones do all damage types , amarr and gallente boats get 5% or 10% per level to damage types which are not there racial damage types.now look at the disparity , caldari do not get any damage bonus on cmb's to anything other than kinetic.either racial damage bonuses should be applied , gallente only get bonus to thermal damage they do,amarr only get bonus to em damage they do and mini only get bonuses to exp they do.or caldari have there racial damage bonus replaced with a non racial one like the other races currently enjoy."
9/4/2009,another solution might be to take away 25% of raw damage type and replace it with 25% kinetic.so a heavy em missile becomes 75% em 25% kinetic when fired for a cara for example.this would give cmb's the kinetic flavour and then a 5% per level rof bonus for each level a player skill up the hull.
9/4/2009,"thermal is not amarr racial damage , you still get 5% more thermal for every level your train on a hull with a rof or damage bonus."
9/4/2009,"missile have a tracking type paramater, its called explosion velocity.i dont have a problem with kinetic emphasis as such.its having a kinetic emphasis that depends on player skill level thats the issue.the more you skill up a cmb the more tied into using kinetic you are, so every time you skill up the less of an advantage swapping damage type becomes.if it was a straight 25% kinetic for 25% of missile damage type to give a kinetic bias, then add a 5% per hull level rof or damage bonus there wouldnt be an issue."
9/4/2009,"the quote is messed up. true. but this ""tracking"" is different and not as critical factor as with turrets, for several reasons.this leveling thing makes some sense, though there is no real problem......but this does not. in short, to not make too drastic changes to ships that are already good or decent, you would have to plan all the bonii from the ground. and your all-around suggestion would blow balance to hell."
9/4/2009,"there are allready ships in game which have rof bonii to missiles.the raven has a single rof bonus ( no racial damage bonus ). this is generally not complained about as overpowered.the sacrilidge has double bonii to missiles ( rof and raw damage ). again its not really seen as overpowered.yes the ships will be boosted somewhat , but not to the point of being overpowered.non of the ships in the list can be considered best in class for pvp.missiles are someway behind guns atm for pvp usage and could do with a boost."
9/4/2009,"the irony of this post is overwhelming. anyway, this isn't the proper way to fix missiles. want to fix missiles? fit a tp. reduce the explosion radius penalty if you have to. missiles are the only weapon type that always do some damage unless you can outrun them (difficult unless you have a fast ship) or you get enough range from them."
9/4/2009,"well im sure all races have ships that could use the best possible bonii for them, like drake with 25% rof and 25% resists. guess which bc would be the only one you would see out there after that.the damage bonus is made as it is for a reason."
9/4/2009,"i'm not seeing the irony.this post is not about missiles , please read the op , its about the bonus on caldari missile boats being incompatible with tactics.its about a lvl 5 player getting the shaft for all the training he did.its about the racial damage bonus that cmb's get being equivelent to 1/4 of the bonus that the other races get through there racial weapons systems damage bonii.if amarr get 5% rof to lasers andgallente get 5% rof to hybrids andmini get 5% rof to projwhy shouldnt caldari get 5% rof to missile launchers.just trying to level the playing field here.imagine if tomorrow ccp changed the mini damage bonuses to only apply to the exp component of the ammo choosen.you would here the wails from 1,000,000 lightyears away"
9/4/2009,"would you post the exact ships you are comparing here? also remember that you are comparing different weapon mechanics.drake: 5% resist, 5% kinetic dmg / harby: 10% cap use 5% damagecane: has double bonus, in practice just about making the projectiles usable. myrmi has is its own story.cerb: 5% kinetic dmg, 10% missile velocity, 10% flight time, 5% rofsacri: 5% ham damage, 5% resists, 5% cap recharge, 5% rof...and so on...now why do i still fail to see the problem?"
9/4/2009,your not seeing the problem because you are comparing ship versus ship.do this.compare a level 2 caracal pilot versus a level 5 caracal pilot in a small fleet shooting at an ishtar.imagine that both players know what they are doing.neither player will fire scourge because an ishtar starts with an 85% kinetic resist.the level 5 player does 0.0 more damage to the ishtar than the level 2 player because both players fire em|exp.the player who trained level 5 got no advantage for training level 5 in this scenario.now look at any ship other than the ones listed in the op.mini damaged bonused ships get a rof or damage bonus ( not a racial bonus ).a level 5 mini pilot will allways do more damage than a level 2 mini pilot in the same ship.same is true for gallente and amarr and caldari rail boats i might add.
9/4/2009,"you are right about caracal, but only because the second bonus is also a bit ****ty. fixing that would be more of an idea."

9/4/2009,"it should be 3 hours reduction per lvl making you have a 5 hours timer when maxed, long enough for you not too use it for forth/back quick combat, but short enough to use it to get out of your expensive implants and in a pvp clone and back after the pvp'ing, make you lose a lot less and thereby motivating players too pvp more"

9/4/2009,"supported due to potentialnice idea, though when reading the whole thing my brain melted and is now in a puddle on the floor. has great potential, but probably needs to be simpler to work and be coded into the game. maybe have crew be equivilent to t3 subsections with fuel needs?"

9/4/2009,i support this.
9/4/2009,"signed, supported, loved, touched and kissed."
9/4/2009,supporting all but the tempest changes. i don't believe any concessions need be made to justify boosting that ship. ecky's tempest changes seem superior. all of astro's other changes i fully support. signed x2.
9/4/2009,"this seems to be a recurring theme. i'd love to work on the tempest some more (to be completely honest this whole list was from the top of my head written in 10 minutes), but i have no faith in ccp using a 100% role bonus on a tech 1 ship. i do quite licke ecky's change, but i don't think it's realistic at all. i think we should come up with something easier or more concrete, perhaps something as simple as 7.5% rof/5% falloff. this gives it even more dps than 10% damage/level and doesn't have quite the overwhelming alpha. i'm open to suggestions, always."
9/4/2009,"there are a number of equivalent ways to boost the tempest. 100% role + 25% damage + 10% falloff is the same dps with battleship v as:6 turrets, 8 highs8% rof per level (gives 10.00 effective turrets) + 10% falloff -same dps, less alpha than current but better range6 turrets, 8 highs13.5% damage bonus per level (10.05 effective turrets) + 10% falloff -same dps, far more alpha, better range---but again, the above changes would make the tempest very heavily dependent on battleship v."
9/4/2009,"7.5/8% rof and 10% falloff sounds pretty acceptable to me. yeah it would pretty much demand bs 5, but i think i'm okay with that. the maelstrom is by far the easiest minnie bs to fit and use, especially for pve and that type of thing."
9/4/2009,"i love minnie and my first bs was a typhoon... great fun and loved it to death (litterally, lost 3), but not flying it again until i got better skills. i'm cross training atmo because i feel kinda backwards for being a minnie flying minnie bs d:what i like most would be the change to getting a better alpha while retaining dps. thats what i expect when i hear 'artillery' - slow to reload, but when it hits, it does make your ears go 'pop'.so, good ideas - signed :d"
9/4/2009,"while it wouldn't bother me personally in the slightest, i'm sure most who'd disagree with this proposal don't read this forum, so i will speak for them:no./ben"
9/4/2009,"are you guys forgetting that you dont get back your insurance for yours mods? or do you fly around in empty fitted ships? which really no one doesi can buy a bs for 90 mill and easily spend 100 mill on mods...thats 190 mill invested..i have insurance gives me back say 80 mill ive actually lost 110 mill...wake up!!anyway i wish they would allow insurance on t2 ships, why they dont offer this is crazy, yes prices vary but make insurance percentage based on cost and perhaps insurance claims..the risk you guys want is there in t2 ships, you can lost a 130+ mill ship and not get anything back, you train up all that time etc for t2 and then poof its gone no money - now theres your risk..and if you fly alot of t2 ships, and t2 fitted then if you pvp alot then you lose money very quickly.... jeez what more do you want...blood!!"
9/4/2009,"while you personally may lose a lot on fittings, a lot of people don't. people exploit systems like t1 loot drops, smart bombs, or cheaper solutions to fit their ships. in addition, modules are simply a transfer of money, not a removal of it. you may spend 20-30 mil on guns, but ultimately, someone else get's that money. insurance you pay into, and nobody get's the money. there's always fixes to the module problem you mention, and they are natural and expected, and need to be influenced more. not everyone should be in a battleship 24/7.if you can't afford to fly a bs, fly a bc or a cruiser, or a frigate. if you can't afford insurance + mods for a big ship, go down a scale, learn to fly it, and expect your fc's to addapt to that fleet.insurance negatively impacts economic warfare in it's current state. it's why corporations are so easily willing to toss battleships out like candy to their members, it's why the proliferation of battleship heavy, and cap heavy fleets has occurred. i personally prefer diverse fleets that show of all types of ships and abilities, but in todays game, it's hard not to expect 90% of a fleet makeup to be battleships, and the remainder hacs. it's unfair to the alliance leadership because w/o bringing these ships, monetarily members are considered a waste, it's just too easy not to afford one or the other. it's unfair to the members, because it rules out whole fields of ship styles for a majority of fleet types. and it's unfair to everyone because warfare get's dumbed down to it's most simplistic form, which is point and click warfare.believe it or not, in the past, warfare had an element of artistry to it. individual pilots had roles, and everyone from the guy with the most expensive fit navy mega right down to that guy who brought the t2 crow were all capable of doing amazing things."
9/4/2009,insurance needs a change.stop the faucet.stop the payouts for concord
9/4/2009,"this.on another note, t2 ship insurance could use a slight boost...but that's a different topic."
9/4/2009,"insurance is more or less built to encourage pvp. pvp is the basis for a lot in this game, especially driving the market. no insurance = less pvp (not no pvp, just less).any ""fix"" in insurance needs to address that issue or it won't happen.if you want a virtually ""no insurance"", then use tech ii ships.equating real life with a game is usually not a good idea. in real life, insurance factors in whether you are often driving long distances or live/drive in bad areas. but again, the reason for insurance in-game isn't to support you in case you lose a ship and can't make it to work without one, it's to encourange pvp. (to actually compare to real life, military assets aren't insured, at least in the same sense of the term, because they are built to go into combat and are expected to blow up at some point.)for the ""insurance scamming"" section, let's actually go over that math. assume you are correct. first off, you don't consider the price of the battleship to be mineral cost, but how much you could sell it for. if it's 85 mil of mineral cost, then it is 90 mil of actual cost. but anyways, you pay 85 + 30 mil for 115 mil.nearly three months later you could blow it up and receive insurance. however, platinum insurance is for base mineral price only. if base mineral price was 85 mil, that's what you'd get back. you blow up your ship and receive 85 mil. now you have to buy another for 85 mil and insure it for 30 mil. you are out the 30 mil of insurance, not the mere 5 mil that you rated.now, if the insurance isn't working correctly and actually repays more than price of minerals, you might try to fix that mechanism."
9/4/2009,"i'm not sure you even read the first sentence of what i typed, but let me correct you on one thing. insurance payouts have always been flat rated. for instance, the raven insurance has always payed out at 108 mil max (off the top of my head). the reason it currently cost between 72 and 85 mil on average to build a teir 2 ship depending on region and if you do buy orders or if you buy off sell orders. you have to consider build cost, not market cost because market cost isn't accurate for the ship, it fluctuates based too much on demand in a region, and any buyer can always circumvent that if they so choose.so what you get is essentially the floored out cost of battleships or very close to it. 108mil - 32 mil cost to insure = 76mil floor. that means that beyond the bad mechanics insurance has on players getting new ships, it also has a horrible effect on markets. mineral prices cannot drop lower than insurance floors. that means that tech 1 ship prices will always have an artificial build cost floor, and mineral prices will ultimately always averaged out to whatever the floor is. sure zydrine price might fall, but somewhere else the price has to go up once that floor is met. changing the insurance system helps the economy of this game as well as the warfare of this game. the trick is to still keep it pvp friendly, not stupid friendly."
9/4/2009,i smell an alt.
9/4/2009,"maybe tweak alchemey from the x10 time and resources crap fest that it is, to something more reasonable like x5 or x8? but that is a solution for themoon minerals. as for omg hac prices are to high. f-off they are not back in my day (mumbles) *walks away waving a cane*"
9/4/2009,"ok, look, i would like to address the 'back in my day' comments.this is not your day. back in the day hacs could fly 10,000 m/s, kite missles, shoot out 800 dps of fast tracking blaster pain, and web for 90%. today is not your day. subtle and small nerfs to the hac over the last few years have slowly eroded their cost effectiveness. there's nothing wrong with this, so long as ccp knows that they need to balance the cost of an item to their usefulness. specialized ships do not need to cost 200 mil. what's rediculous is that command ships (just as specialized) are now costing as much as certain hacs.that being said, i find that yes, in fact the problem might lay more with r64 moon distribution. likely the loss of delve to the nefarious goon swarm has driven the costs up because resources are scarce as they acquire sov 4 and build their large poses on now empty r64 moons. i think the discussion ought to shift to fixing hac (and t2 production in general) dependency on r64 minerals, and work to balance the cost of all t2 ships and equipment more towards rational levels."
9/4/2009,"ok, then maybe i will paint you a picture and maybe you will understand that the cost effectivness of the hac has very little if anything to do with the actual price of the damn hac. get it through your brainskull, hacs cost as much as they do because the cost of actually building the things is going up. using the fluctuations of the market as some sort of gauge to decide if a particular ship needs a buff or nerf is not only stupid, but criminally so*. if you think there is an issue address the issue it self. if you think the hac has been nerfed to much and needs a boost, say so. do not hide behind things that you do not understand like markets, and breathing** as an excuse to get what you are going for. in following, man up and stop **** dancing. post what you want not some half assed excuse for what you want.picture as promised red = invention costspink = mineral costsblue = moon poo costsgreen*** = profits* i don't actually think criminal charges can be pressed** i am reasonably sure op understands breathing.*** special note the scale for profit increases or decreases according to individual inventors and the cost of materials.edit: to clarify what determines the cost effectiveness of any ship is the pilot, and those he flies with, anything no matter how cheap is not cost effective if you do not know how to use it properly. unless of course somehow insurance pays out more than the ship+fittings+insurance costs."
9/4/2009,"i don.t but then i dont paint a big blue dot on their foreheads, either. idea would be hilarious if implemented, but i have to say no."
9/4/2009,"not supported. nap trains are merely a symptom of a greater problem, that being: projection of force in 0.0 is too easy thanks to jumpclones, jump bridges and capital ship logistics.people will blue each other as long as they feel there is a mutual benefit to be gained. nerf large-scale logistics and there won't be a benefit to having friends on the other side of the galaxy anymore, and the nap trains will break down naturally./ben"
9/4/2009,"fine, then the market value bottoms out at value x, anyone but a moron will not go under value x as this cost is barely a % above cost. now you have sales queues stacked on top of each other, how do you determine whos items get purchased? is this who placed the order first based? skill based? what if all the sellers have the skill to 5? if you say this will not happen, i ask you to recall one of the first lessons you learn in life. other people are idiots.with .01 isk 'wars' i still manage to sell my goods despite only manipulating my orders once or twice a week. barring a high volitility market like jita this whole proposal is a solution to a non-problem in my book. or maybe you didn't make your case properly i'm not sure. maybe i don't see this as a large enough issue to validate changing everyone's game play experience."
9/4/2009,"now this is only possible for two reasons. first, if the product is in vast oversupply - in this situation the market will fall to the level of production cost no matter what. granted, it will fall quicker if my suggestion is adopted, but in current system, pennying can only delay the process so long. second possible reason, if the market is unhealthy and cant rapidly react to changes in supply/demand, and that is precisley what my suggestion would improve. oversupply situation? the price can easily fall to production cost in a hours notice. even below, if sellers (some of them not producers, but speulators) panic or just bail out to move their money to a greener pasture. but prices can skyrocket for the same reasons, placing huge extra profit into the producers' pockets. in the system that i have in mind, momentary supply/demand plays bigger role, than today, and production cost counts to a lesser extend. (what production cost, anyway? raw material and semifinsihed goods prices will also fluctuate. )yes, that's precisely the rule employed by orderbook-based exchanges worldwide. anyway eve also has a time-based precedence rule to prioritize orders that are on the same price level, so no need to reinvent the wheel here either (however, i suspect that in eve, the order with the less time remainig to expiration stands first in line) i am not solving a problem, rather, proposing to adapt an idea (based on seeing how well it works in rl) that i think will make the game better and more exciting. also i hope other regions will have thriving and volatile markets then agree, its not a large issue, but the consequences for the average palyer are commensurately modest as well. however, for ppl playing around the markets, new dimensions will open, or at least so i hope."
9/4/2009,"well, i'm going to disagree based on your original principle, and not just the 0.01 isk wars.who would want to do that? um... i would! yeah, i would ask for a discount to 47k, and the seller would respond by offering me 47,750, and i would counter with 47,640, or something. happens all the time.and yes, paychecks often get paid in ridiculous amounts like $5,423.79 dollars. you would tell your friends that you made $5500, if you care to talk to them about your salary, but the truth is different.ever buy gas? i don't know if you can say $0.01 any better than that. but walmart does, they cut their prices from 1,089.99 (other store) to 1,089.78 (walmart) it happens, and it works on some.but on your original idea, a ""sufficiently round"" number, well, what makes it sufficient? some might buy and sell out to 5 or 6 significant digits because that counts to them. who gets to say at what point it no longer matters? if inflation continues in eve and you are selling something in the tens of billions, does the million spot no longer matter? i would think millions still do.the reason why this might be more important in eve than the real world is because in eve you are selling the exact same item. in the real world you can convince people to buy from you because of your charming personality, or some kind of guarantee, or because you keep flowers in your shop window. the only way to stay on top of an order in eve is by small tweaks in the order so you come out on top."
9/4/2009,"ok so i proposed a way to solve faction/t2 crystal issues.but it was not very popular because of the random nature.so heres another solution based on crystals shattering that removes the randomness.replace the damaged attribute on crystals with a hidden attribute on the player himself.this will be a counter that gets reduced as a player fires his lasers.when the counter reaches 0 a crystal is destroyed and the process starts again.to the player this will look like crystals shattering occasionaly during use.crystals would only shatter occasionally and never all at the same time.detail.player has an attribute called crystalpop ( this is server only and not visible to player )player starts of with a crystalpop of 1000. ( 1000 used for example only )1) player fires lasers2) if a faction|t2 crystal is fitted in the laser then [..3) crystalpop = crystalpop - ( damagesetamount + damagevolatility ) * groupsize...4) if crystalpop < 0 then [....5) consume one crystal.... [ if a spare crystal of the same type is in the cargo hold then the consumed cystal is taken from there ].... [ if there are no spare crystals , then the group is reduced by 1 ].... [ if the group size becomes 0 then the weapon shuts down ]....6) reset crystalpop = 1000 ]]crystals will get consumed at a steady rate as they do atm.pro'sall crystals will be brand new.all crystals will be stackable.ships with faction crystals will be contractable , because there will be no damaged crystals.[ unwanted | looted ] crystals will be resaleable on the market.all issues related to damaged crystals go away.conplayer will have to carry 1 spare crystal minimum."
9/4/2009,.
9/4/2009,"this idea, i think, is much better. i would support this idea.one problem i see with this is, and i haven't worked out any math, but wouldn't this increase the supply of crystals on the market (since they can't be destroyed except when ship goes poof and people will resell), therefore price would crash? not sure if this matters much, just throwing it out there. crystals become more of a module that is destroyed once and a while than ammo that is used. although, can't you reprocess damaged crystals to get all the minerals back anyways? i thought i read somewhere that you can.but yeah, much improvement on the idea!"
9/4/2009,"don't double post.quote your original post then edit: it with your new idea.p.s. it still won't work with weapon grouping. during a fight do you want to ungroup your guns and find the one that is broken, replce it and re-group them?/ still not supported second time around"
9/4/2009,"this way people who thumbed up in another post aren't supporting what essentially is a completely different approach to the matter. where we can support the topic, a new thread makes sense.p.s. with weapon grouping it can work the same as missiles and ammo recharge do, a replacement of the same kind automatically being taken from the hold if a replacement exists. if non exists... well, how does that work for other ammo types. i don't see that as a prevention of this idea."
9/4/2009,ok i never thought about the support button. i do beleave you can unsupport (need to try at some piont)yeah if you reload the whole rack that alot of isk to carry around in cargo hold.8 guns = 8mill @ 1mill for cystal (guess) + 8 spare crystals = 16mill isk in ammo not that i would mind the kills mails on that but thats alot of isk just in ammo
9/4/2009,"yeah, just inconvenient/impossible to make everyone to do that.except with this idea, it only happens every so often for the player, not for each crystal. it could be modified so that it happens rarely enough that you should only need to carry one spare crystal, maybe two for an especially long battle, or something."
9/4/2009,what happens now if you use grouped weaons with crystals with different damage levels?i never live long enough to find out what happens when a crystal pops :)i would support the popped crystal being taken directly from the cargo hold if spares are available.guns would keep firing without interuption.edited op with crystal consumed from hold ..
9/4/2009,"except the fact that it is 1. realtime and live2. interactivewhich is quite an improvement in my eyes.i agree that these days the only option is youtube, but for the next at? i'm not a programmer, that's true, but the more i think about this, the more i think it's not that hard to implement. the client already contains almost everything for it... the rendering engine, the ships' outlook data, and also the window that's capable of showing a new ""layer"" of 3d visuals (that is ""look at"" in show info).but -for the devs' luck- it seems, that there's simply no need for it... :d"
9/4/2009,please give me 10 billion powergrid and 10 billion cpu for every ship; that way i won't have to think about my fit!
9/4/2009,"you're going to have to be far, far more specific to save this thread from the rolfires of lolhell. pg issues? nighthawk? definitely. drake, onyx? hardly."
9/4/2009,"i'll add another to your list, rokh. that thing is ridiculously easy to fit. try fitting amarr ships and discover the real need for fitting mods. and as to the nighthawk, i have no experience with it, but it sure seems popular and there are no lack of sellers and buyers of it. and what's all this about using it to tank level 5s? must be indicative of it having insurmountable fitting problems? oh, maybe it could easily flip to quite overpowered if buffed. but i wanna peeveepee wit it.why are there so many caldari flying crybabies? (not at you gypsio, at the op)"
9/4/2009,"nighthawk suffers when trying to fit a gang link, heavy assault missiles (ya know the close range high damage ""pvp"" ones), mwd, and tank. other command ships can fairly easily fit the above, only with specific weapons of course.when it comes to passive tank + heavy missiles the nh is a fine ship other then that caldari is pretty much fine."
9/4/2009,"the nighthawk doesn't have any fitting problems when used for carebearing. but for pvp, it needs a gang mod and mwd, and with hmls it just doesn't have the pg, not even for a basic single-lse buffer tank. don't even think about active or a dual lse buffer. the great thing is that adding pg won't affect the pve capabilities, because the carebears have no use for more pg on their passive bricks. but tbh, all the field cs need to be redone, the nh isn't alone in having unnecessary fitting problems."
9/4/2009,"i'd trade 10% cpu for +10% pg on ferox and eagle any day, maybe even 15%.if you need more then 1 rcu/acr to fit something is obviously wrong."
9/4/2009,just because you cant fit all neutrons?
9/4/2009,"the problem is that they are mostly hard to fit compared to other ships when it comes down to pvp.my believe is that this is mainly due to the fact that caldari already has high demand for pg due to the shield mods and launchers. couple with that the ew mods also have a high demand for pg, caldari ships run into trouble fast.however this topic holds no solution or idea whatsoever except a demand without argumentation, therefore no support."
9/4/2009,"are you serious? i think you are. have you much experience with other race's ships? i have experience with them all, and caldari ships are possibly the least difficult to fit. sorry you can't have your ridiculous passive shield regen, point and web, range, speed, and damage all in one bundle. learn to sacrifice some tank and range ability if you want to do high damage and tackle."
9/4/2009,"just because i can't make a fit with all 250s or even 200's without powergrid mods, and have 100 cpu left unused after fitting. wtf is with this cpu? am i supposed to fit cloak in spare high?the problem with those is they seem to have pg/cpu balanced like a missile boat with more cpu and less grid."
9/4/2009,you mean the way it can't even fit a rack of 425s and nothing else?
9/4/2009,"actually i am, what seems to stand out is that caldari ships are low on pg and consume high amount of pg which is what my post was about especially in pvp fits. take a drake for example i for one don't fit it with as huge as possible tank but max out on damage mods and ew and it tends to run into a heap load of trouble because the little tank i have is also consuming loads of pg especially with 7 heavy launchers this is going to be a tight fit. i can name a few others but i wont start a whole list here.there are a few ships of each race which tend to stand out due to fitting issues but i know none so many as the caldari ship lineup.with my experience as mainly a minmatar first and caldari second pilot i have run into less trouble with my minmatar pvp fits than with my caldari pvp fits."

9/4/2009,"supporti cant quite see any normal player needing to open a new topic more than every 10 minutes, so wouldn't affect normal forum functions. if its not a bot, the person doing it is going to get real bored real fast. (always a plus)also, wouldn't an ip ban, or even batter a mac ban, be a reasonable solution to caught isk sellers? (i say sellers because i know a friend in wow whos account was hacked and used for gold spamming by the hacker)"
9/4/2009,agreed; for legitimate posters it's a price worth paying i think./ben
9/4/2009,"the mack is a great ship for mining ice. however, its cargo capacity w/ two large cargohold expansion i rigs is only 7,935 m3. this unfortunately is 65 m3 less than the 8,000 which would be required to store two ice mining duration cycles. mack pilots are faced with the choice of returning to station with 4 cubes after one cycle or waiting for the second cycle and seeing one of the next 4 cubes disappear in space because the cargohold is full. putting an expanded cargo module in a low slot solves the space problem but at the high cost of not having an ice harvester upgrade in the slot.simple fix: increase the base mackinaw cargo attribute from 6,000 m3 to 6,100 m3. this would be in keeping with similar recent increases for the orca and some of the capital ships.global enhancement: add a new skill to either industry or trade - ""cargo management"" prerequisites industry v and trade v. attribute +5% increase in cargohold capacity for all ships.thanks for your consideration / fly safe"
9/4/2009,"i'll leave it up to csm/ccp to decide whether to do this. it might make sense, but...you could instead fit two cargohold optimization ii rigs and/or two expanded cargohold iis, which would bring your total cargo hold space up to 14,045. not bad. now you can do three cycles instead of the one for your fit.edit: yes, you may have to give up some upgrades or armor resists or something for those low slots, but eve is all about choices and the consequences. which do you value more, your current low slots, or increased cargo space?as for cargo management skill which increases cargohold capacity for all ships, i'm going to suggest a no to that. this would unbalance existing industrial, transport, freighter ships, as well as give mission/salvage boats more room for loot and all ships more room for ammo, and other mining ships more room for ore."
9/4/2009,"i think i've seen somewhere that such a skill existed at one time, but was either never released or removed from the game. mack's dont need more cargo space, you just need to not mine alone, or afk."
9/4/2009,"yes, eve is all about choices... here is one where less than 100 m3 would make a huge difference in the performance of a specialty ship. probably the 6,000 m3 was an arbitrary number. ccp has changed the orca and the capital ships fuel, why not a minor tweak to the mackinaw?"
9/4/2009,"reduce base cargo to 1000m^3, add 8000m^3 ice bay, and (optionally) allow people to mine directly into the ice bay."
9/4/2009,"basic reason not to support this idea: you will get plenty of amarr players changing races or quitting the game because their crystal shatters on the first try.random number generators, or chance, is a funny thing. even if the chance is 1/1000 you could still buy 1000 crystals and have them all break on your first use. the average is not your average, it's the average of every crystal used in the game. of course, someone else will buy 1000 crystals and end up never having them break. such is the nature of chance.for invention, this might be fine, as the end result that really matters is overall supply and if you have a bad streak of luck you can make some money missioning or producing, or something. for something like pvp, if i were amarr i wouldn't find this acceptable to rely on."
9/4/2009,"i posted an improved solution which does not involve randomness, it should still be on the first page but could do with some support."
9/4/2009,"this. who the hell counts the number of shots they make in order to figure out ""oh, my luck's running out, better get more spares!"" as an amarr pilot? any other pilot can see exactly how many shots they have left. also, with 7-8 weapons, each with a 1/1000 chance of breaking, you're down to ~1/200 chance. so, a crystal that costs more than 1k of hybrid ammo can break on the first shot or will very likely not live to fire 200 times? i'm thinking this is a stealth nerf to amarr more than anything...and i don't even fly amarr ships."
9/4/2009,"deal with it minmatar have to carry ammo, 1000 rounds of medium barrage 250k to 400k deppending where you are. battling a bs in my vaga can take 1000-2500rounds so amarr having to carry ammo and reloading during battle welcome to wonderfull of minmatar pvp."
9/4/2009,"read the thread before posting. dav wasn't complaining about having to carry spares. this thread was his idea, he was just pointing out the pros and cons and having to carry spares would be a con, even though he doesn't consider it a very large con."
9/4/2009,my moros uses guristas or shadow antimatter xl depending on what i have in my hangar.looks like you'll have to find a supply of blood or sansha multispecs wont you?have a good day.(p.s. try jita)
9/4/2009,"you do realize it takes billions of isk in skillbooks and almost a year to train a titan parking alt....right? i don't fly one, but i don't like that so many pilots are just trapped in their ships simply because metagaming keeps them from using other methods."
9/4/2009,"not supported. it's a players choice to fly in one or not. supercaps can turn the tide of battles, so not giving them safe haven is an acceptable drawback."
9/4/2009,"metagaming is up to them. their choice to stay in their titan. non-docking is the designed drawback to titans.this channel should be for making suggestions for the game to run better/smoother, not to get around designed balances, so... /not supported."

9/4/2009,"hey,i've posted an idea to the features and ideas discussion forum regarding the use of live events to introduce changes to eve such as new tech being introduced. i was hoping for some feedback but that forum moves a mile a minute and overnight it's dropped to page 3 without a single reply. and even ideas on that forum which get dev attention have consistently resulted in absolutely nothing being implemented. i'd like to know what the csm's positions are on this concept and whether or not it's something that should be pushed for. the thread is below:"
9/4/2009,"i think the icons representing bpos and bpcs should be improved. there should a color difference or include bpo or bpc in the name so that it can be easily and quickly identified as such. so that players with hundreds of bpos and bpcs don't have to waste all that time figuring out whether the icon is bpo or bpc.font size is a huge problem in eve. it is hard even for people who has great eye sight, like myself, to read anything on eve. font size should be able to go up to 20pt for everything...not just chat windows.icons such as the character sheet, eve mail, etc all should minimized to their icon instead of the bottom of the screen.chat interface should be changed to where you press enter to type in the channel that you're on, so this way all keys on the keyboard can be used as hotkeys instead of having to use: shift, ctrl, or alt....i think that was the dumbest idea ever."

9/5/2009,you keep saying the same thing over and over. your brain doesn't seem to be able to process the logic.my zealot can only do em and thermal. unless i stick autocannons on it and then i don't receive any bonuses.your raven can do em/therm/kin/exp damage equally across the board. even the cerberus can do decent dps doing non racial damage. have you ever tried putting lasers on a vaga?
9/5/2009,my damage-bonus is the resist hole on the other ship. i won't use kinetic-missiles on an ishtar for example because it has natural high resists against it. i would load em or explosive.

9/5/2009,"aye, it was a nerf to far. 75% with maxed skills seems about right"
9/5/2009,"not supported.the: mine -> build -> insure -> pop -> isk, thing is a 'problem', but you are creating a lot of other negative effects in trying to deal with it in the way that you are.also the minerals -> isk conversion, via ensurance, is not all that bad. it helps set a price floor for minerals."
9/5/2009,"i could address your examples like saying that 47640 is just a bit less round as i like (4 digits of value rather than 3) or a 5423.79/mo salary is probably resulted from a combination of a negotiated (originally round) yearly salary having been divided by 12, undergone some percent-based raises and bracket-based taxation. (thogh the walmart example really baffles me. )the main question here is, whether, based on your experience, you feel like these cases are rare exceptions or a general rule. my experience suggests the former, however, if you feel the latter is true, i cant argue with that, and respect it as a valid reason for your voting against my proposal.it is never easy to draw a boundary, but that is no reason to go limitless. anyway, the current fixed 0.01 precision limit is just such a boundary, only it is drawn not where i think it should be.based on the contributions made to this topic, those who supported my idea either did not critize the 3 digits of value rule, or suggested just a bit more, 4 digits. it seems, at least so far, that a compromise would not be difficult to achieve.just on historical note, in our country we had a massive inflation after ww ii, the currency ""pengo"" practically entirely lost its value. during this process, first ""milpengo"" notes were printed (in which name mil standsfor millions) and later ""bilpengo"" notes (the word ""billion"" menas 10^12 here), and then nobody cared for millions any longer. or for those bank notes, anyway, as the paper they were printed on, had more worth than the money .i can not agree, because eve market system is, both in purpose and implementation, the replica of an rl orderbook-based commodity exchange, not any arbitrary kind of business conducted in rl in general. when trading on a rl exchange, you are trading just the same item, and naturally only the price matters. these exchanges, almost without exception, do have tick rules, and it works for them."
9/5/2009,so pretty much the current system only you can't tell how damaged it is (stupid) and the crystal always remains packaged (good)? sure. at least it's not as stupid as the other ideas you've had.
9/5/2009,"nvm, misread a very importent point in the idea."
9/5/2009,"no support for caldari. nerf them, if anything."
9/5/2009,"what should be specified is that most caldari gunships are almost impossible to fit within pg. rokh, ferox, eagle, ect. all struggle to fit a full rack of guns, never mind fitting a full rack of guns and a mwd. utility highs are pretty much impossible to use. perhaps the most glaring example of this is the eagle; even with all level 5 skills, the eagle is short over 100 pg with a rack of t2 guns and the 10mn digital boosters, the cheapest mwd in the game. this is even more ridiculous considering the general lack of low slots on caldari ships.just to give a comparison to its counterparts at level 5 skills:muninn, 1450pg, 5 lowszealot, 1475pg, 7 lowsdeimos, 1237pg, 6 lowseagle, 1093pg, 4 lowsso yeah, i support some more grid for caldari railboats at the least."
9/5/2009,"umm, you know you can fit a full rack of 425s and doomsday tank a rokh, without rigs and still hit further and harder than most others. i'd say its pretty ok."
9/5/2009,neutron blasters? it's a railgun platform. and it needs two grid mods in order to fit 250mm rails. i'd say it needs some <3
9/5/2009,blaster ferox is a nice solo ship.
9/5/2009,signed.
9/5/2009,do you fly a frig in your fleet if the orders are to bring a battleship or logistic cruiser?the point is that todays pvp is very costly thus requires people to plan their isk loss in advance thus insurance helps you to prevent going bankrupt to fast.also i think the buildcost of ships is not determined by insurance but by material prices.a bs wont cost 5 mil overnight just because theres no insurance anymore. don't you think so?
9/5/2009,"i'm for insurance reform. certainly no insurance for concord caused losses, would like to see ""premiums"" based on frequency of lost ships (like rl) so the insurance mineral price ceiling is less predictable."
9/5/2009,"that would be in keeping with the changes to the orca and other ships, mack is a specialty ice ship so he gets an ore bay sized to ice. good idea!"
9/5/2009,i dont see any problem/me hugs his t2 cargo rigs
9/5/2009,"mack is a mining ship, with mining bonus and 2 ice mining bonus, not a ""ice mining only"" ship.if you substantially remove the mining roles nerfing the cargo space into oblivion you are making a 15% yield in ore mining useless. btw: with kazuo suggestion mining in the ice bay should not be ""optional"" but a automatic feature as the main bay will be incapable of accepting even 1 cycle by one of the ice harvesters (in a mack 1 cycle produce 2 1.000 m3 ice cubes) of 1 cycle by one stripminer. the initial suggestion of increasing the main bay to 6.100 m3 seem the more sensible one and so i support that suggestion."
9/5/2009,"i like the idea of a dedicated ore bay in the mack. however it should not be for ice only as the mack can be used for mining other than ice. probably nerfing the regular cargo bay would be a good way to balance the change, but not too small.would support the original suggestion to add 100 m3 to the existing configuration. simple and straightforward, could probably be done in a routine patch."
9/5/2009,an ore/ice bay would be reasonable- i suppose it's not as if all the ice would melt.
9/5/2009,"changing the base cargo capacity from 6000 to 6100 m3 is probably updating one attribute in the mackinaw object. should not be a big deal. dedicate ore bays would be nice, but that might take a lot of time and effort. go with 6100 and declare victory."
9/5/2009,"covert jump portal generator uses 1500 power. that is 10% of the total amount of power availeble on a black op. black ops would be much better to fit if it should get a bonus on this mod. lets give it a bonus that reduces the power output by 99,9%."
9/5/2009,umm....why? its pg requirements aren't that bad considering mega pulses or other related weapons take up far more pg space. no support for an issue that doesn't exist.--isaac
9/5/2009,probably already mention/worst idea ever but whatever.in real life when you keep getting your car trashed over and over... what happens? the rate goes up.how about scaling insurance or something based on how ofter you lose your ships. if you keep cashing in on insurance left and right the rate goes up and if not then it goes down?i am sure there would be more to it to make it work well but would bad?flame on.
9/5/2009,honestly why? how things work in real life isn't a reason to do anything in a game. you need to provide an actual argument with reasoning why this should be included in the game.
9/5/2009,"especially since there are several other threads about this topic already, including at least one on the first page of the assembly hall.please learn to read for comprehension, not just speed."
9/5/2009,i like the idea so long as with the allowance of docking supercaps in this manner. you actually lose the ability to control who can dock at the station.so you gain the ability to dock supercaps; more or less safely... but you lose the ability to control who can dock... which open ups worlds of lame for docking games. which given visual confirmation of supercaps... add in the future changes of sov. very cool.

9/6/2009,"no. ac falloff is already twice as much as blasters and pulses. a 20% increase to dps is probably needed, though.fixed. and yes!!no. ccp must have been on drugs when they created the ammo for minmatar ammo. mixing it with this will only make it worse.instead, ccp need to re-create minmatar ammo from scratch.fixed, and yes. as for the rest, i disagree.are you high? i don't even know where to begin with this one. the 66% dps bonus already makes this ship a beast. and you want to make it better than a tier 3 battleship??i don't know enough about the muninn to say.the phoon is arguably the best tier 1 vessel in the game for the sake of versatility. it doesn't need any changes imo."
9/6/2009,"please limit discussion on this issue to the ships and modules thread that is currently running at 32 pages now.in addition, here are some following points:tempest: even ccp has acknowledged that the ship is no longer viable. if you can't see that yourself, you have no business making any posts about solutions to any minmatar issue. the ships and modules thread goes into great detail why the tempest does not measure up to even tier 2 damage dealing ships. please read it.muninn: see suggestion above or make a new thread.typhoon: there is another thread on ships and modules on this very subject. again please read it, and make your points there."
9/6/2009,"supported.i didn<U+FFFD>t sent in my own sugestions since i was afraid of a long eft\numbers war.good job orakkus, keeping the thread clean.aks:agreed.tiered falloff:argreed, with the extra base falloff for aks it is actualy preaty nice. i had a more linear progression(0->10%->20%) in mind but then again with the extra base falloff a very good idea to.amno:make it so! the damage lose is only on nuklear and carbonized lead and it is not a very big one(9% weaker). even in pve where nuklear has a use for artillery the new fusion is a very good tradeoff for it.artillery:would work, even if i would prefere a bit more dps+tracking over a bit more range. 40% more damage and -25% rof would keep the dps on the pest nearly the same(a little higher actualy) while still having a alpha close to 5.7k. tempest:with the increased ak falloff yes. 5% falloff per level are good(7.5% would still be awsome). since you can deal more damage with the changed faction amno the dps lose is not this big in the end, and barrage gets a lot more falloff to help it.only drawback i see that you will end up with with a to low dps number in general fleet fights(on top to the range issues, shooting in falloff, low base dps, low tracking), but this is more related to the artillery change than the tempest.munin:agreed."
9/6/2009,"i'd like to point allen to the discussion thread currently held in ships and modules. please if you're going to discuss, do it there."
9/6/2009,this thread must stay on the front page imo its not just the tempest that needs help all the minmatar battleships do. as well as guns
9/6/2009,support this all the way. -soloi have flown a rapier alot. and true with some fancy flying and good skills you can damp a cruiser stay out of range with webs and shoot him with artys. but your dps is **** so unless he is plated you most likely wont get the kill.-fleet taking of damps and fitting more webs and shield extender or plates mwd ext ext still leaves you having to concentrate on one maybe maybe 2 ships depending on targets. and having the worst survivability of all the recons.-i would like to maybe see some sort of bonus to its tanking ability ie extra mid or low for plate or shield extender -pg bonus as well would be nice
9/6/2009,supported. scrap the painter bonus; it just doesnt fit.
9/6/2009,"considering the number of them in the game now and the fact they they destroy the gfs(if lag hasn't) i see it as a good thing to convert them to a super dread. the battle-ending dd was never a good way to regulate subcap super-blobbage. maybe also give the supercaps some ew that can alter the numbers wins situation with cap battles, i.e affecting dreads in siege.the super-blobbage is a creation of the two-sided political devolution in the game. address the political dichotomy by changing sov mechanics, and having moon mins deplete and reshuffle. that will reduce the multihundred on each side blobbage better than a dd."

9/6/2009,we should be allowed to have as many friends as we want.
9/6/2009,did you read the op at all?
9/6/2009,"yes i did, i only misread the part where to store the info. my apologies for this.well i still see some issues:- extra data(ok minor with only one atribute, but not any player uses lasers)- you will need a spare crystal any time since the damage carryies over between ships- you will lose more isk in pvp with it, since you lose 1 crystal any 10 minutes instead 5 after 50 minutes -> if you lose your ship after 40 minutes firing you allrady had to burn thrue 4 crystals, in the corrent scenario you are still with your first set of crystals - you could fire some shots with a s crystal to prevent your xl crystal from getting destroyed(ok comedy issue), since the price diffrence between scorch and faction amno isn<U+FFFD>t this big no real issueon the code level you could simply destroy the crystal in the gun after firing, if the value hits zero, then reset it. since there are no unrepacked crystals any more you could even use the block standard reloading like other weaons do while ungrouped(if the gun runs out of amno it realoads automaticly with the same amno type if it is stored in the cargo, what isn<U+FFFD>t possible with unrepacked amno atm).overall a ok idea, even if it has some minor drawbacks in pvp.suported."
9/6/2009,"you can unload and reload when that happens, no need to ungroup and regroup. i like this idea a bit better then the other one"
9/6/2009,"frankly, no. the shatter chance idea was far better than this one - hidden information about your ammo state is silly, and the random chance whining was only because most people don't understand statistics worth a damn. this is harder on the server than your first proposal, conveys even less information to the player than the status quo, and is farther removed from your original purpose. no support."
9/6/2009,it needs one reactor control for a full t2 250mm snipe fit.
9/6/2009,call me crazy but how about this thought:requiring a fitting mod on the shield tanked ship is a compensation so you dont have all lows full of damage/tracking mods?
9/6/2009,tradeable kill rights sure does sound interesting...that would be a better version of a bounty hunter. if you could hire someone to kill someone via trading your kill rights through eve contracts. they bring the corpse back to you and keep the loot etc. implementing this skill you are talking about as well so you have to train for bounty hunter rather than having someone on -10 racking up all the kills.another question... does killing people with bounties give you a security boost?
9/6/2009,the op is just wrong wrong wrong. not all of us have all day to make isk. we have real jobs. t1 ships should be cheap to fly and to lose. t2 is where its at anyways.
9/6/2009,"i think insurance is a good idea...without such insurance payouts if you were to pvp, murder someone in cold blood the chances of them making another attempt is significantly less. therefore less pvp will occur because carebears like myself will refuse to participate due to the huge isk loss, possibly running myself and others into the ground."
9/6/2009,technically someone once payed for it so the gametime itself isnt actually free
9/6/2009,"i agree with this. the plex is bought and owned by the character making the conversion. if you need to sell one somewhere you cant get to, use one of the spare character slots on your account and send him to jita or wherever, convert, sell, give isk to main char.i personally tend to sell within my alliance and ask where the buyer wants the plex. flying around isn't that bad of a thing to do as shuttles and interceptors are fast. besides why risk transporting it and loosing it when you can fly to your destination then convert it."
9/6/2009,"there are no real legal issues i can see developing- an individual has not bought gametime when he buys a plex.he has bought an in game item that can be exchanged for gametime. as can gtc. as can anything with an isk value in eve.a plex really only represents its isk value as much as gametime.if someone blows up a freighter carrying faction bs and sells them, they can buy gamtime with the isk.there is absolutely no functional difference if someone were to blow up a hauler full of plex.allow people to transport plex. give piracy a boost ffs, its about damn time for one."
9/6/2009,"agree to this.plex market is really strange ; look at the price at jita, then look on other system, you can see a 50m difference sometimes...a way to transport then is neededotherwise, the day people will stop gambling on them, the price will fall... a lot.and i don't think ccp will appreciate a little price for this :)"

9/6/2009,"armor resistance is currently 10/25/35/50 plus 10 toward the racial opposite's damage type. however, shields have an unconditional 0/20/40/50 resistance as a base on all ships (not including bonuses). i would like to see shields having the same base resistance model as armor. this would be either:10/20/40/50 + 10 where appropriateor10/25/35/50 + 10 where appropriatethat is all. flame on."

9/6/2009,"in your own words, why? are you somehow suggesting the 20% base resistance deficit for shields is a good thing?you can have your cap/cpu hungry omni-tank active mods too, if shields can have the not-so-cap/cpu hungry passive omni-tank mods."

9/6/2009,fixed.
9/6/2009,"since the best argument you've yet to offer is ""i don't think it's right"" not supported."
9/6/2009,"look at the tournament. small gang pvp shield tanks and caldari ships are dominant (along with ecm). and before someone says ""but those shield tankers don't need to fit a point"", there are dedicated tackle ships being used this year because the scrams can stop mwd-ing.not supported. shields regen, armor doesn't. and for the person that said armor repping is more efficient, yes but it does not rep as much raw damage per cycle as a shield booster. shield transfers are preferred for small fast engagements. remote armor preferred for larger fleet battles. the two tanking types are different and they are relatively balanced in dissimilar ways."
9/6/2009,"shield tanks are unpopular in pvp for two reasons: 1) missiles are bad, and the number of gun/armor ships in fleet far outweighs the gun/shield ships in practice. because of that, titan, command ship, rr, and other such fleet structures push people to armor over shield. 2) mid slots are more valuable than low slots - ew, sensor boosters, tracking computers, ab/mwd, cap injectors, and tackle all take up mid slots, as opposed to just fitting and damage mods in the lows, and aside from ecm ships there's virtually nothing that has more than 1 extra mid compared to its lows. in terms of raw numbers, shield tanks routinely outperform armor tanks at burst tanks, and are on par for sustained. the problem is, it's almost impossible to actually make use of that in a practical setup for 80% of pvp roles. until you fix that, resist changes won't make a difference - shields already have an advantage there anyways, because invuln > eanm."

9/6/2009,"it's a legacy workaround which shouldn't be necessary. a suggested replacement is a session-change icon that persists for as long as the session change needs to complete with no mistakes.this timer takes little chunks of time from you continually, in absurd places like switching positions in a fleet (often leaving you stranded on the wrong side of a gate) or when switching ships you have no intention of undocking, in an unoccupied system in the quiet and cold reaches of 0.0.depending upon your play style, and a conservative estimate of how much time is actually wasted on the timer compared to the actual session change (i.e. 30 seconds wait, ~15 seconds of client/server activity) you could be looking at spending almost 1 hour out of 10 waiting unnecessarily.there are some chunks of text floating around somewhere explaining the reasoning behind the timer with regards to stuck petitions. but with the recent, supposed fix to desync, it seems like a good moment to slot this in as a measurable target for the dev team. a box to tick, as it were.for those that don't know, the current explanation is that without the session timer, people were getting ""stuck"" and the gms had to free them. the session timer allows the client/server to interact until some unknown process finishes its calls safely thus preventing any race conditions from occurring.however, it's quite unnecessary since a modicum (lmao ccp wordfilter)of good coding puts error checking in place, and the amateurish workaround of relying on an arbitrary timer would go away.i've also seen several people argue that there are gameplay implications to these timers, but that's mainly because people have gotten used to them and since the change would apply to everyone equally, the pubbie motto of ""adapt or die"" seems apt for setting aside this irrelevant worry.so vote yes and get back that wasted time!"
9/6/2009,"i have to support this! if it goes through, it will cause sooooo many lol-highsec-station-camper tears, i think i'll have enough to fuel my pos for years to come!two thumbs up!"
9/6/2009,"ship switching, clone jumping are both affected negatively by this, i'd like that reduced as much as possible.it's not like ccp doesn't know it's cumbersome, they know it's required, but even if we can shave of 10 seconds, it would be helpfull."
9/6/2009,"session change timers feel like an artificial limit hacked into place to make someone's job a bit easier. maybe i'm wrong about his and they're still needed, but it's certainly something worth asking ccp for."
9/6/2009,"it's a role that is sorely missed, in my opinion. would add a lot of diversity to frigate gangs and be a lot of fun for everyone."

9/6/2009,i dislike the proposal for a dedicated ore bay - feels too much like trying to remove the ability to increase your cargo space - but the original 6100 m3 proposal makes perfect sense. let the mack do its role better.
9/6/2009,"four ships can fit this module. all four of them were designed to fit this module, and have their fitting levels calculated for fits including this module. i see no good reason to ask for this. yes, black ops can't fit everything at once. they're not supposed to be able to, just like every other ship."
9/6/2009,"your math sucks. 8 guns at 1/1000 is 1/125, 7 is ~1/143, it's only 1/200 at 5 guns. and a crystal that costs a little over 1000x as much as hybrid ammo will not ""very likely"" fail on the first 200, that's actually rather unlikely. one shot out of the first 125 volleys, yes, but that uses 1000 rounds of hybrid ammo, not 125 like you seem to be implying. remember, it's not a full reload when a crystal breaks, it's a single new crystal used, just like it's 1000 total rounds used in the same number of volleys of hybrid. and no, it's not a ""stealth nerf"" at all, except for applications where a ship won't ever live to fire a lot of volleys(e.g., suicide ganks), but suicide ships maybe wanting to carry an extra crystal won't exactly cause me to weep. and given that it dramatically clarifies the pilot's ammo situation(an issue you specifically identify - status quo, amarr pilots have no idea of their ammo situation, under this proposal they would know exactly), and it greatly simplifies logistics of ammo by allowing used crystals to be traded by means other than a station trade. for the average amarr pilot, i think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages."
9/6/2009,i always carry some spare crystals in my amarr ships anyways. so yes
9/6/2009,"1) carry spares. crystals are tiny, bringing 50 mostly-dead ones into battle shouldn't inconvenience you too much. 2) if you want to propose an actual game mechanics change, the crystal shatter chance thread seems a better bet than crystal merging."

9/7/2009,"at first, i was highly annoyed with this change as i had been in wormholes before i moved to 0.0 and i realized what kind of nerf this was. then, i went and watched a certain pvp movie and realized why this was nerfed. said movie showed first a rifter and then a typhoon engaging in some very interesting low/null-sec combats. i realized though that as they moved in to attack a player, the person controlling the ship would be constantly jamming the button to scan almost nonstop. this, to me, seemed like the reason ccp nerfed it. i can imagine there would be some server-based performance issues with someone constantly jamming said button to scan the area. also, it puts in a tad more risk to those who attack targets just as much as those who are getting attacked. is this nerf too much? maybedid ccp need to nerf the constant hitting of the scan button? yesdid ccp need to make a stupid message that annoys the crap out of anyone? nowill this affect me? no. (since i didn't hit the button every .001secs)should it be unnerfed slightly? again, maybe. it seems that ccp has decided it should be 2 seconds. i'm more of the opinion it should be 1.0-1.5 seconds per calibration. thus, no support for this. --isaac"

9/7/2009,"it is actualy not, it is even a lot more simple as you think. the damage simply carries over if you switch the ship or crystal(this is why it is mentioned in the op you need spares). even if it looks bizare, doesn<U+FFFD>t matter this much in a bigger picture. for faction amno any 4k shoots you lose a crystal, no matter of size or ship you are in at this point, since you can<U+FFFD>t see this value you can`t exploid it(and the price diffrence is not this big that this would make a lot of sence to beginn with). t1 crystals don<U+FFFD>t got the atribute that discribes the damage to them, so they can<U+FFFD>t affect the value."
9/7/2009,"i see no big issue to using the same value for both.since any crystal atm takes damage seperatly, the checks are done atm to, there is no change in the needet calculations. you simply merge all the seperate stats into one and remove the crystal that caused the value to drop to zero. all what changes is that you lose the crystals linear, one by one instead all at once if the reached her capacity. so basicly you need to replace one crystal every 3h for mining instead 3 after 9 hours. the t1 crystals or no crystal use would cause no change to the value at all, since the atribute that describes the damage a crystal would take is on the crystal and missing on t1 crystals(or zero, this is why they don<U+FFFD>t break)."
9/7/2009,"can we ""develop"" new technology to scan out cloaked ships with tachyon probes?"
9/7/2009,"after years of playing eve, this needs to be addressed, this game has been out long enough for this to be changed.recently we engaged a guy sitting outside a station, we got him down to almost no armor. 6 people from his corp joined the battle immediately after logging in. the reinforcements (instant logon fighters) saved the raven by jamming our ships and forcing me and a friend to retreat.in eve the strategy is about assessing the situation to determine whether or not you can defeat the enemy with the given intel which the game provides. i determined that we could kill the raven and i was correct, until his buddies logged on and joined in the battle and changed the entire situation. that is unrealistic and ill thought out.to prevent this unrealistic strategy the following should be considered.upon logging in there should be a stasis period for your ships targeting systems and weapons systems. a period of time which would prevent people from logging on and joining a battle. the people who are logged on are basing their judgment on the current situation, and deciding to engage on that information. creating a stasis would prevent the log on fighters from manipulating the game. this is not part of the strategy the game was designed for.reinforcements:its understandable to expect reinforcements, but to have an army log on and instantly appear all around you and fighting you instantly makes no sense at all. if anyone has any other helpful solutions please post them."
9/7/2009,"i can think of a fight or 2 if that was active then i would be able to kill that mofo. yeah, i support it since it makes lots of sense to me anyway."
9/7/2009,"while log-on traps are not a method i've used with any frequency, i see no reason why they shouldn't be a valid strategy. if someone really has the coordination to pull one off effectively, then good on them for working as a team. part of eve is knowing who you're fighting- and if they're the type to try a log-on trap, then you need to factor that into your strategy, and not just go in gung-ho and try to gank their ravens."
9/7/2009,"no strategy is foolproof, and reinforcements is a valid tactic. there are no guarantees in eve. nothing says two battleships must defeat one, variables are what makes the game fun for long time players."
9/7/2009,at this time it is a part of the game and any smart corp would keep that in consideration.log on traps are not realistic and manipulate the foundational strategy of the game. a stasis period would simply force battles to be more realistic and embrace the overall strategy aspects.
9/7/2009,"reinforcements are of course realistic and should be part of any game. perfection is a life long goal my friend and this is just one issue which would step eve that much closer to a simulated battle which doesn't consist of log on instant reinforcements. variables are welcomed in a battle, that is what the strategy plans are created for. you plan for contingencies. the issue here is when you create a plan of attack based on a current intel and it is manipulated by ships being added instantly due to being able to jump into the game with no stasis.stasis period should be embraced to create a more realistic simulated experience."
9/7/2009,"while we're at it, should we put rpgs on our ships and use steel armor? eve isn't exactly based on reality. again- if this was something that was legitimately broken about it, you'd have my interest- but the fact is it's a part of the game. if you get tricked by a log-in trap, then so be it- you lose a ship and buy a new one. i've come damn close to losing ships to log-in traps on multiple occasions- and you don't see me complaining."
9/7/2009,"it's odd, really. most pvpers seem to be gung-ho about removing local, which would make traps of this nature far more common and far easier - you wouldn't even have to log off, just get off grid and align. for that matter, most pvpers fly in 0.0, where a single high slot on a frigate can spawn a couple hundred dreadnoughts, and frequently does. and yet, here we have a pvper who claims that traps are unrealistic, immoral, and should be nerfbatted. at the end of the day, traps will exist, and traps should exist. this particular mechanism for a trap is unrealistic, but plenty of realistic mechanisms for traps are impossible because of gameplay issues. balance > realism, and given the limits of the tactic, i'd say it's pretty balanced. no support."
9/7/2009,your suggestion wouldnt prevent this kind of traps. it would just delay them. and as herschel mentioned. with the wh style local you wouldnt even notice that.
9/7/2009,"that is the point.instant log in trap is not supposed to be part of the game, it is something that people discovered and manipulate. part of the game it is unfortunately, however, i dont think the dev's intended for it which deems not a function.pure and simple, a delay is exactly the point, a stasis period that creates a realistic combat scenario. yes this is a game, and the goal is to simulate as close to reality as possible.i hope the dev's take a good look into this, that is the purpose of this post.a stasis delay would reinforce the strategy aspect of this game and allow the people who actually plan their attack based on the enemies who are logged in, not the hundreds of other people who ""might"" log in."
9/7/2009,"you missed a point right there. when you remove local, you still see them in your address book and if your not sure where they are cause local is gone let say, they you still got the agent locator which should help you alot.what he's asking for is a simple delay in loging on. i could say 30 seconds or so which could give time to ""finish"" what he was doing in the first place. this is just to give a ""fair"" balance. log on traps will always exists if you ask me.again, read it one more time, he's not asking to prevent it. just delaying the log on. which should in turn give a bit of a fair advantage. as some other said which i can't remember who.it might be called complaining but its still argumentative for the simple fact that lots of battle could of been won or saved because of the log on trap.in short, i find the log on trap unfair."
9/7/2009,"not really, most caldari ships can fill their lows with damage mods and have t2 weaponry. at least if you have awu 5 and that skill has to count for something.however, there are certanly some caldari ships that do need some extra pg, the craptor comes to mind, perhaps even the nighthawk, but the rokh and eagle is not one of those that suffer from pg shortage."
9/7/2009,"if by full t2 250mm snipe fit you mean fit with no hint on tank then yes, it can. and every other sniper hac can fit same without that extra 15% pg from rcu"
9/7/2009,you're crazy. this would effectively mean that shield-tanking ships would have fewer slots than their armour-tanking counterparts.hang on... nerf minmatar!
9/7/2009,just as an example. my cerb has 3 bcu. show me any sacri normally featuring 3 damage mods.
9/7/2009,"true i didn't give any details on the fit. im sorry about that but theres too many and people who fly caldari ships (especially gunboats) will know about the pg problem.for example, the rokh. try to fit 425mm x8 a mwd and some others mods which i can't remember cause im at work. its impossible . theres almost 100-300 missing and i could have all mods online and running. at most i have to take a gun off and everything else fits. but if i do that i have less dps which most caldari gunships have problems with since it gives a distance bonus instead.i could use the named versions but still..again i lose some dps...but i could get it back with some faction ammo but those arent cheap in pvp after a while. i could be really specific over the setups but soren already started to do that here anyway.p.s: i'm talking about pvp, no pve since pve don't have any problems with pg..well i dont anyway"
9/7/2009,"you really, really need to train some fitting skills. as i mentioned, the rokh can fit an all t2 sniper fit, including a full rack of 425's and a mwd and still tank a doomsday, even without the use of rigs. now where does that imply a need for more pg?"
9/7/2009,"ohh, ffs, ok. sorry again. doing 2 things at the job and writing in the forums is not a good thing to do.anyway, it wasn't 425mm. it was blasters. sure, sniper is fine. thats cool and i got no problem with that. also to note, i got all skills max to fit a ship. the only things thats missing is the implants which im not ready to buy.heres the setup that i'm trying to get to work[rokh, ion blaster pvp rokh]tracking enhancer iidamage control iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iiheavy capacitor booster ii, cap booster 800x-large shield booster ii100mn microwarpdrive iishield boost amplifier iineutron blaster cannon ii, antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii, antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii, antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii, antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii, antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii, antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii, antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii, antimatter charge llarge anti-em screen reinforcer ilarge anti-thermal screen reinforcer ilarge capacitor control circuit ihammerhead ii x5=============as you can see, that doesn't work. if i remove a blaster, it works. but i don't want to remove it. theres also the fact that i could use ion blaster instead and have 8 of them...but i don't want ion, i want my fock'n neutron blaster grrrr edit: i tried using named for everything except cannons and it doesn't work. still not enough pg"

9/7/2009,"rather than redirect with a link, here's a direct quote:las vegas, nevada, sept 3 (reuters life!) - gamers competing against rivals around the globe in online multiplayer games have a new force protecting themteams of virtual detectives.while some companies cause havoc with pc users via e-mail spam and viruses, a new type of spam company is targeting the huge worlds of massively multiplayer online (mmo) videogames like activision blizzard's ""world of warcraft.""in-game characters controlled by individuals working for spam companies infiltrate these virtual worlds and bombard players with unsolicited ads for the sale of in-game virtual items like swords and even playable characters.this type of activity is forbidden by all game publishers within their player rules of conduct so sony online entertainment (soe), which oversees mmo games like ""everquest,"" ""star wars galaxies"" and ""free realms,"" is flexing its online muscle.soe has created the norathian underground gnome investigation team or nugit, which refers to the fantasy world of norath in ""everquest.""this nine-member team focuses on in-game fraud, working like detectives as they police soe's game worlds in search of spammers and try to uncover their entire operations.""people get very frustrated when they see spam. it's the equivalent of junk mail and you're getting this in-game and it's very frustrating,"" said john smedley, president of sony online entertainment.to date, soe has closed 295,000 subscription accounts across its mmo games as a result of nugit's patrols.brad wilcox, director of customer support at soe and manager of nugit, said these ""farming"" organizations are very organized. where there's a demand...companies hire players to log online and build up in-game characters and accrue virtual items and gold by performing mundane activities.these items are transported via ""mules"" to ""runners,"" who sell these items to players for cash through third-party sites.players looking to upgrade to better characters or access more powerful weapons can buy these items directly, saving themselves hours of playing the game to get these upgrades.game publishers don't like third-party companies making money off their in-game worldand many legitimate players don't like dealing with these interruptions to gameplay.""once a player reports a spammer or farmer to nugit, we watch the individual account and track other accounts of the mules and runners associated with the organization,"" explained wilcox.""rather than closing down one account, we'll follow the individual and end up banning as many as 100 to 200 accounts based off one tip.""smedley estimates the worldwide take of farmed virtual items is $2 billion a year industry via these third-party companies. ""a lot of them are offshore. it's very difficult to stop somebody that's in another country, particularly one where the laws aren't friendly to the united states and it can be very challenging,"" he said.soe does offer an alternative to its players, letting them convert real cash into virtual cash to purchase in-game items from the publisher legally and safely.since mmo game publishers rely on monthly subscription fees from players, ensuring they keep enjoying the game is key but this does open up cash opportunities for farmers.""as long as players want in-game items so much that they're willing to spend real-world money on them, this is going to be a problem,"" said chris baker, videogame editor at wired magazine. ccp already happily employs people in isd and lets us elect this csm thing... why not employ some of the more ingenious contract hounds to prize apart these organizations within eve?i've seen 1 person track down an entire organization once in the past, and pointed it out flatly to ccp... which did nothing (so far as i know the controlling characters at the head of that 300+ hierarchy are still active)."

9/7/2009,"consider what images are conjured when one thinks of a titan. it may not even be a ship, but one of the mythological titans whose power was exceeded only by the gods. alas, assessment of battle does not paint as daunting an image. to be sure, in their current state a titan is a good asset to an alliance as they can move capital fleets using jump-portal generators. but on the other hand they by no means on the same scale as mythological titans where save, perhaps, the scale of their size. despite this size, titans can be easily out-tanked by dreads and mother ships. though a titan's main offensive weapon, its ""doomsday,"" has a myth logically intimidating name; lets face it, it can't take down most battleships if fitted properly. in its current state a titan does not fill the role that ccp originally intended. here are some proposals.currently a titans doomsday will do about 70000 damage of a specific type. now with any ship you are not hard pressed to get 80% resistance. this brings a doomsdays damage down to around 14000. all battleships can withstand this and even some cruisers leaving capital ships almost unaffected. to try rectifying this by simply boosting the amount of damage that a doomsday inflicts also presents a few problems. 1. friendly ships on grid will also have to take this damage. not to mention that having a weapon that can wipe the grid of all but capitals would be considered too powerful by some. be that as it may, one solution to this would be to set the doomsday on a timer. the timer would be visible to everyone on grid and would count down until to doomsday activates. this would give friendly and enemy ships alike a chance to warp out (unless bubbled or pointed). 2. alliances with multiple titans would essentially be able to destroy every thing on the grid by warping in multiple titans. solving this would be easy by not allowing the pilot to activate their doomsday while another doomsday's timer is active. hence, there would be a 10, 20, or 30 second delay between doomsday's. color this with some back story on how a black hole will open if two doomsday's activate at once or something along those lines. nowadays titans usually don't fit guns, which in and of itself isnt a problem. but as a compensation titans should get a remote rep and cap transfer bonus. additionally a titans tank is disproportionately low. with faction fittings there are battleships that can almost tank as well as a titan. to fix both of these problems titans could have a siege module similar to the one that carriers and mother ships can use.constructive criticism is welcome. so post away"
9/7/2009,"1. the timer is stupid. you can already warp out when you are not tackled. your timer wouldnt change that much.2. titans can be tackled and killed aswell. shown regularly. doubld dd is not nice, but well part of the game. and its not like we have 24 titans on 1 grid regularly. so most cap ships are fine with 1-2 dd.3. imho rr bonuses on the titan isnt really going to help. they already give huge bonuses to your fleet.4. titan tanks: imho the real problem is that people learned how to kill them and bring the right amount of ships.last but not least i can say you mix too many topics into one and i cant really support the thread."
9/7/2009,"fyi, dominion brings titan changes, they get a single targeted dd now and moms get fighter-bombers"

9/7/2009,"shield tanks already have plenty of advantages over armor tanks- as do armor over shield. they are each regularly used, and have their purposes. for the reasons already outlines in this thread, i do not support this change."
9/7/2009,"no, invul = active, meaning it requires lots of cap.eanm = passive, no cap needed.shield doesn't have a passive type of shield take gives resist to all without sucking cap. we need that. besides that, this thread is not supported. usually, shield users are here for support...nothing else. its a good balance in my opinion. if you want a better tank use an armor tank...honestly..no pun here"
9/7/2009,"depends what you fly. for smaller ships, invuln cap use is very relevant, for big ones it really isn't(unless someone is neuting you and it turns off). i suppose my answer was a bit more skewed towards bigger ships, but that's what needs to be balanced for the most, given that they're what's flown the most. and no, you don't need to have everything armor has, just like armor doesn't need to have everything shield has. balance can be achieved without everything being identical."
9/7/2009,"you do realize it's a tier 1 bs, right? that it has 8 hardpoints at all is a major advantage over other ships."
9/7/2009,"from everyone i've talked to, the typhoon is at or near the top of the list for rr roles. it's also a great solo ship as it can dish out good damage with nice speed, and have extra highs to play with for other uses.it's a great pocket tool that's cheap and fun to use. it's also very versatile as it has the ability to use drones, guns, and launchers, all with nice, but not insane dmg, or it can go straight gank and dish out insane damage for low cost but high skill requirements.in all honesty, i wish more ships were like the phoon in it's very unique role. it's definitely not a point click bs like most, but that's what makes it so awesome.there are 11 other t1 bs out there, there are faction bs, soon more faction bs, and t2 bs. there are also bc, t2 bc and a slew of other ships to choose from if the phoon doesn't suit you. if you want a double damage bonus to turrets, take the tempest, if you want tank and gank, get the maelstrom. the phoon is in an ideal 3rd slot.oh yeah, and just for the record, any ship with a rof bonus gets more of a boost than a ship with a %dmg bonus. so while it might be split weapon, it's also getting more dps per gun/launcher than any ship with a straight dmg mod bonus."
9/7/2009,"typhoon pilot here and i like the setup. sure it's an oddball, but so is the scorpion (well, a primary target and an oddball!). personally, i use it as a giant logistics ship thanks to all them tasty lowslots to keep the power flowing. while it may not be the best for dps, it is definitely a versatile and useful battleship (which is the point of the ship)."
9/7/2009,not supported. a typhoon with 8 bonused torpedo hardpoints would be able to dish out over 2200dps overheated and with some implants.
9/7/2009,big big mistake i hearby request rollback

9/7/2009,i agree completely.things like changing ships or fleet positions should not start an unconditional 30 second timer but instead take only as long as actually required.i wouldn't mind keeping some timers as actual game mechanics (eg the earliest you can undock is 30 seconds after docking; but you may change ships as often as you manage to do during those 30 seconds).
9/7/2009,i support this product and/or service!
9/7/2009,"there is no good reason for a hull like this to exist. not every niche demands a specialized ship to fill it - sometimes, you just fit the relevant mods on a usable ship and go from there. it's not like frigs lack for utility highs, after all."
9/7/2009,"tbqh, if they were at all usefull, they'd be overpowered. in general, the smaller the ship, the higher the resistance- thus, the more effective remote rep is on it- not to mention they have lower sig radii- so they're harder to hit. a cool idea, but again, if it was worth sacrificing a dps frigate, it'd be overpowered. afs are already stretching the limits of being overpowered as is."
9/7/2009,afs + logistic ship.otherwise use the logistic highs of your afs

9/8/2009,"i can't believe the people against this idea.in fact, i believe that when you buy a character, changing the name and portrait should be mandatory.as soon as you buy a character, i think ccp should force a name change and a new portrait.i don't believe you should be able to change your name if you aren't selling, unless it is fairly soon after you created it. have a ""cooling off"" period during which you can correct a horrid naming mistake, but otherwise only for sales."

9/8/2009,tempest needs fix. projectiles need fix. arguments have been made by others and there is active thread going on where need for fixes is made clear.
9/8/2009,usually when people refer to another thread they post a link to it. care to indulge us?
9/8/2009,supported
9/8/2009,"agreed.just look at this. tempest no firepower and no tank.6 mid slot for shield? sux. no mwd/no web/no scram/no cap booster/no sensor booster/no eccm and resist same time. (no shield bonus like the other shield tanked ships and shorter med slot withdrawn raven) dominion patch slap more the matar pilots in face -1 mid slot to the fleet pest.ok try with armor. 6 slot too but, all armor user ship have minimum 7 low slot, like dominix,armageddon,megathron,phoon,hyperion,apoc, abaddon.so.. maybe you will shorter with 1600 plate, or damage mod or anm than enemy. mid slot cant help you, because a sensor booster or other modules cant give to you plus damage or plus defense and the enemy pilots will using (mid slots) same modules cap booster,mwd,web there.firepower ? tempest damage in short range is very bad , the other armored bss make it better than.so... you have a worst tank and worst firepower tempest against better ships.just see the killboards and market. just few pilots want to fly with tempest, because he has bad tank and bad firepower and always he is the primary (because bad tank). fleet battle ? small amount of tempest, maybe few snipership in 0.0 but most pilot using rather apoc, mega there.why primary always the tempest ? good fc always know, because you could be kill them faster than other ships.and never top dd when fleet have amarr,gallente ships and starting shot same target in same time."

9/8/2009,"even if i think this should be a role bonus instead a repalcement of one existing bonus, it is a ok idea.also it is actualy 7.5% per level, not 5% if you want to reach 75%.supported."
9/8/2009,"yes - its truly annoying. ccp really dont seem to give a toss about minmatar, and the rapier got b***f****d badly by the web nerf.when are ccp going to fix at least the rapier? balance my a***.minmatar recontarget painters ... never used! can train skills to improve them, no modules can modify their effectiveness. a single rig can help. single ship force multiplier. using more than one tp reduces effectiveness!webs ... cant trains skills to improve, cant improve with modules to modify effectiveness. no rigs can help. single ship force multiplier (3x webs needed to stop anything). using more than one web reduces effectiveness!gallente recondamp + point ... skill them, cant amplify their effectiveness with modules, amplify partly with 2 rigs, can force multiply on one, maybe 2 ships. using more than one damp reduces effectiveness!amarr reconneut + td ... skill them, cant amplify their effectiveness with modules, amplify both with 3 rigs, can force multiply on one, maybe 2 ships. using more than one td reduces effectiveness!caldari reconecm... skill them, amplify their effectiveness with modules, amplify with 2 rigs, can force multiply on several ships. use more than one guys, stack em high!please correct me if i'm wrong, red mist forming."

9/8/2009,insurence should be permanent
9/8/2009,"this... is really detailed and well thought-out. i've taken advantage of insurance scamming myself so it definitely needs to be fixed (how often do you hear someone say that?) some of the details probably need tuning, but you have my support."
9/8/2009,"interesting that this is trying to solve a problem and not just screw over pvp, and that is encouraging.i agree with this, but points need to be made:many pvpers in 0.0 lose as many as 10 or more ships a day and kill many times over that. a short-term tracking system could give them a needlessly bad record.also, a tracking system is going to task the server, which ccp is constantly fighting to cut lag. we should avoid adding to the problems.payment per cycle (30 days might be more stable) should be automatic. don't know about you, but if i choose to insure something i don't want surprises unless i want to stop coverage voluntarily."
9/8/2009,"if you setup a small delay in insurance where it happened on 20 minute cycles much like npc bounty payouts do, i think it would help cut down drastically on lag."
9/8/2009,not supported. i like my suicide brutixs tyvm
9/8/2009,bumping and supporting.gm incompetence is a major issue. sometimes they even fail at squashing ingame isk spammers.

9/8/2009,"actually you can just use the device's for those you have secured with it and log the rest in as normal, you use both codes, with the device-personally after being hacked and lost a large potion of my items that will not be replaced i have become insanely paranoid, i don't even wanna use my code after reinstalling my computer (sadly no way around it hehe:p )i want something that could give me the security when ccp don't want to replace lost items, so i wouldn't have to beg them to replace things lost due to evil hackers :)"
9/8/2009,i will start with twoeosscorpionnothing major just a little someting to make the flyable again would be nice.
9/8/2009,typically when someone makes a ship [whine]fix post.... they make suggestions.
9/8/2009,"then don't fly themedit: although i would like to see all t2 ship prices go down, as it is now they are a bit on the extreme side ;)"
9/8/2009,it is not about the cost of hacs but the cost and performance of battlecruisers being way too good.. hacs need sort of a special skill over bcs to make them worth the their cost today again.
9/8/2009,agility. speed. better base resists.
9/8/2009,"qft, not supported."
9/8/2009,tried t2 stasis webs? they are 60%.
9/8/2009,"use 2 t2= around 83% speed reduction.no 1 web shouldnt be a ""i win"" against anything speeding"
9/8/2009,"point stands, 1 t2 scram is equal to 3 t2 webs. not counting how long it takes for a ship to slow down with webs."
9/8/2009,"this. scrams also don't work on afterburning targets, so there is a clear drawback when using them. if you are so butthurt about your rapier, suggest changing one of it's bonus to web strength increase. the new webs are much better for the game as a whole."
9/8/2009,omg! i just realized you can fit a scram and a web!!!!i think i just won eve!
9/8/2009,"you are dumb and completely don't understand ship roles. the idiocy is strong in here. yes, a long range web ship should get within scram range, genius."
9/8/2009,tryed page 2?
9/8/2009,do i need to point out how rediculesly op rapier etc was against fast ships before the change?.didn't think so..it's balance don't f with it ;)
9/8/2009,"no. webs slow down the target, nomatter if they're abing, mwding or just slowboating, scrams only work on ships mwding. in addition to that, only 1 scram has any effect what so ever (for speed), add a second scram and it doesn't reduce speed any further, and when you web a mwding target, he goes slower, but keep his high sig radius, so he's easier to hit then someone that got scrammed since sure, his speed dropped, but his sig dropped porportionally.web the target so your friend in an arazu/fast ship can close in and scram."

9/8/2009,in iceland some of us read this thread and laughed about how dumb it was
9/8/2009,this might be the worst idea in the history of lousy ideas.... and i have to deal with anderson williams........
9/8/2009,"normally, this kind of admission would irritate me, since i tend to think our elected represetatives should be able to put themselves above (admitting to) this kind of behavior.in this case, however, i will overlook your good natured frivolity and blame on it being in a place where the sun never sets surrounded by servers of eve goodness. and tbh, this really is a crappy idea."
9/8/2009,oh yay... so instead of 0.01 undercuts we get 0.10 undercuts and no one can choose the actual price they want.the market moves that fast because people want to sell fast.if you don't like competition then move out of the market hubs.not supported.
9/8/2009,"not the least. on a 250m cs, you get million isk undercuts (or 100,000, if 4-digits becomes the rule, not my orig 3 digits). it would have been really fair you at least read my proposal before voting against it.neither can now, you cant set 1/1000 of an isk . my argument is, that for normal trading purposes you dont really *need* that fine price steps. the question is, how fine is enough. why dont you make a suggestion?i have no problem with the market moving fast, quite the contrary - i want to move it faster and further. however i think a market moves when the price moves. if lots of orders are placed at practically the same price, thats a stalamate, not a healthy, moving market.sorry a dozen offers differing only in 0.01 i cant call competition. imo competition is when buyers do overbid each other and sellers cut prices by meaningful amounts. i like competition, thats precisely why i made my suggestion.any chance you really read what i wrote and think it over?"
9/8/2009,as said in this devblog:

9/8/2009,larkonis is a cool dude
9/8/2009,yea he's pretty chill but some would call me biased
9/8/2009,he should just be happy that he didn't get a permanent ban as far as i'm aware.

9/8/2009,still supporting glorious leader. we all have our moments of derp.
9/8/2009,"if it would have been a ""carebear"" who acted inappropriately i wonder how many of larkonis' loyal supporters would have been willing to forgive and forget."

9/8/2009,for anyone to think they are infallible... must have some serious issues.
9/8/2009,there is nothing to worry about afk cloakers. but a coverts ops with a covert ops cynogen is your real nightmare.
9/8/2009,"this has been brought up not once but many times. there is a small subset of the playerbase that actually considers this a problem. let's be honest - psychological warfare only works if you let it. the fact that an afk cloaked ship is in system doesn't change one whit if you know he's there or not. if you didn't knopw he was there, you wouldn't care if he was afk and cloaked. without local, the all infallible intel source, you wouldn't have clue that he was in system. if local was removed, the only thing that would change is your perception of the situation. ergo, the issue is not the fact that he's cloaked and afk (how do you know they're afk anyway, and not simply laughing at all of you for hours on end?) but in what you choose to do with the information you possess.not supported."
9/8/2009,"my helios has no form of defense or offense fitted, aside from one small drone for lulz purposes. my entire existence relies on the fact that i can get in and out of your system and watch what your doing with you not being able see what i'm up to. i'm supposed to get you on your toes. when you get scared, you make mistakes. that's my job. if i am able to be scanned and probed out, i've lost my purpose, since i'm pretty much the equivalent of a fly waiting to get swatted when i'm uncloaked.now if you want to nerf cloaks on ships that aren't designed to use one, then by all means, do it. make that ratting raven's cloak ""unstable"" or something, that makes it much harder to probe out but possible. the only way a ship like that can be ""safe"" is by multiple safespots or hiding in a pos. op's idea kills the entire design and purpose of covert ops ships. not supported.this, this, this, this, this. good to see other people who think like this."
9/8/2009,"no support. when i'm ratting in station-less systems usually null sec my only defense against ganking opportunistic pirates is to cloak and go afk and p1ss them off - its fun coming back after 10 minutes of a coffee break and reading local: ""cloak-raven isk-farming *****!111!!"" their tears fuel my cloak"
9/8/2009,"given the latest example of corruption by the csm, it is imperative that their role in the development of eve be re-evaluated.from the original post:""inside knowledge such as this can and will be used to the advantage of the csm and their alliances""no amount of posturing and trolling from the regular assembly hall pseuds can deny that this is exactly what has occured.the csm was envisaged to keep the development team in check after the t20 incident. by the time the first vote was cast, this role had been downsized to that of simple player liason. ripe territory for an opportunist to exploit, proving themselves no better than those they were charged to watch.people get the representation they deserve, so it was only a matter of time before corruption would come to light. how many more economic deals have been made based on insider information? how can we trust any decision made by the csm in this light?the charade must end."
9/8/2009,given that the last time you posted in this tread you obviously have no idea what your saying or doing.your charade must end.

9/8/2009,"you can't make a post, containing an actual argument, worth reading in 5 minutes.this post was written in 30 seconds. it's crap, but makes the point."

9/8/2009,^ this
9/8/2009,hahahhaa this is the best way out there idea ever
9/8/2009,i happen to like hearing the booms of my artillery cannons. i got a surround sound system that plays it crystal clear with base and as i am running missions it just turns to nothing.fix it.
9/8/2009,eve has sound?
9/8/2009,"yes eve has sound +p haha. and yes i turn it off myself while running missions. it's rather annoying to hear the shield hardener sound going over my missiles firing, and me being hit by missiles. imo that the shield hardener, and scan res sounds are quite a pain."
9/8/2009,"i flew a few missions yesterday and turned on sound for a change of pace. i wondered if i forgot to turn it on initially, since i couldn't hear anything different. apparently you need stare your battleships rear thrusters to have sounds in this game. it is sort of sad, that the ""eve has sound?"" crap has turned to be an accurate description of the current sound system.you are better of playing without sound at the moment. it gives a performance increase and if you like using a more tactical view, you won't hear anything even with sounds turned on."
9/8/2009,"no worries, ccp is not ignoring eve's sound"
9/8/2009,welcome to eve :)
9/8/2009,"think about it. the buddies who logged on he could have been in contact with the whole entire time. via vent or cell phone. and if you take into effect that if the game was real, his buddies are just sittin' in the station doing nothing (loged off). when he calls for help, the rush to their ships (log on) undock from the station and join the fray. adding a delay to locking upon log on will cause more issues then not having it.i'm sorry you didn't get the kill, but that's eve.edit: fixed to think from thank =p"
9/8/2009,yeah and even delaying is stupid.want some tissues?
9/8/2009,i'd never thought i'd see the day a pvp'er is ####ing about getting out-ganked by a bunch of clever pilots.hell they logged on... they didn't run.and your throwing a damn fit?seriously... that's messed up.i can get log off's... station camping games... but that?this is normal for eve.... don't like it? gb2wow or something.not supporting yet an another whine thread.ps: this is no different than pilots who are logged on and a system over.
9/8/2009,"you guys do not value real strategy, its seems you value taking advantage of game mechanics so you can feel get off some cheap kills and then brag that you did it so well.what would you all do if you couldnt sit at your computer at the log in screen waiting to attack... perhaps you would have to fight toe to toe and figure out a real strategy.i do not expect anyone to understand this except the dev's, which i hope take this to heart. yes, we have heard it all, crying, whining, that is nothing new for an insult. i have been playing since march 2004, so honestly tell me somethign i haven't heard, or better yet, dont!this thread is meant to help the dev's realize that there might be something to fix.try not to cry on this thread and be helpful, or dont post."
9/8/2009,"strategy |'stratje| noun ( pl. -gies) a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim : time to develop a coherent economic strategy | shifts in marketing strategy.  the art of planning and directing overall military operations and movements in a war or battle. often contrasted with tactics (see tactic ).  a plan for such military operations and movements : nonprovocative defense strategies. origin early 19th cent.: from french strat<U+FFFD>gie, from greek strategia generalship, from strategos (see stratagem ).for someone who is crying over losing a battle... you sure seem to contradict yourself.it is common sense to have a communications line to other members in the corporation seeking to set up an ambush.they don't even need to be logged off! they can be 1 jump away from you.i suggest you take a step back... or better yet... take a week off."
9/8/2009,"you can't change the ""logon trap"" without making some serious change to the game. problem with statis is:pilot x logs in after an op deep into enemy territory. and suddently he's is a blob! he can't lock, he can't target back. the blob can *poff*. or if the blob can't well, we have a serious issue of ships escaping situations they really shouldn't be able to escape.please, stop whining about a game attribute so widespread evryone should know how to use. including you!"
9/8/2009,"buildso, let's put it another way.you said ""in eve the strategy is about assessing the situation to determine whether or not you can defeat the enemy with the given intel which the game provides"" and i totally agree with you. some people claim that eve is about numbers, it is not, it's all about intel. when you know they have more and that you can't engage, just don't engage.in your case, you did the right thing considering there was only a single raven.you also did the right thing by retreating when you realized they had more in system!if you knew that they had a lot of people in the station, would you have engaged?it seems like you didn't, so just consider it a lack of intel and next time be aware that they probably live in that station.basically, logging off is another tactic to hide numbers, just like waiting in a nearby system does. player shouldn't be displayed in local anyway, so always be ready for that situation. as far as i know, it hasn't been considered as an exploit and obviously will never be, so get used to it, it's part of the game and it ""makes sense"" when we consider local not to make any sense."
9/8/2009,its not the lack of intel which is the problem. its just the fact that if you attack someone and then all of a sudden you get 3-5 or more guys coming online to help him. myself too find that....exploitative in some way. if they were online and waiting 2-3 jumps over i believe i wouldn't mind killing that raven myself but log on and be ready right away. there just seems to be a problem with that.so the point is not the fact the intel was missing its the fact that people can get online and be ready immediately.
9/8/2009,"well this is a game, so some differences to real life are to be expected. the metagaming being something you just can't remove and any attempt to do so only shows the lack of thinking of the one who thinks it is possible. you are more likely to hurt the actual game then metagaming with changes, that are designed just to limit metagaming. it isn't that big of a deal once you adjust your thinking to consider it.that said it is a lack of intel, since proper intelligence gathering would have aided and can help you defeat them. you just have to consider more then just the single situation when you consider intel and think as a gamer, not just as a character. if the one lonely raven sitting there was everything you knew, you would have no real intel, but only some situational awereness and possible capability to assess that ravens fighting capabilities. one basic way to gain intel on hostile organisations is to engage them solely for the purpose of measuring their reaction. attack a normal resource gathering site to see what their backup is, so when the real offensive begins you know to attack them too. attack one of their ships and measure response time, ships used, tactics used(log-on traps belong here), active players vs those just logged on, ect. the list goes on.the op didn't have much intel. he just saw an opportunity and took it hoping for the best. it didn't work as planned, but the whole situation propably helped him to gain a lot of helpful intel on how that organisation operates. he can now avoid similar engagements with them or set a trap to counter their log-on trap, if he has the resources to manage that. the intel game is constant and can be turned to your advantage, if you put effort into it."
9/8/2009,"this isn't an issue that is solved through a stasis period.a stasis period just punishes people who were disconnected for whatever reason.instead this is part of the ""remove local"" argument.local is one of your only sources of intel. this is the source of this technique."
9/8/2009,not supported for all of the reasona already outlined.
9/8/2009,"that raven sitting outside station had ""trap"" written all over it. even a dumb grunt like me would have seen that. you should have brought more firepower to the party to take him down within seconds. and if you couldn't do that you should have waited outside system on a gate he would likely go through.remember now: when a wt is sitting outside station 9 times out of 10 it's a trap."
9/8/2009,"and the other 1 out of 10 it will turn into a trap faster than you can say ""it's a trap!"""
9/8/2009,"is it realistic for a pilot to have lag in a battle?is making me have to wait 30 seconds after d/cing to continue a fight fair? even when i d/c multiple times?if you guys can complain about your problems, i'll complain about mine. i'm not blessed with 8 meg internet and no lag like you are. i lag, i d/c sometimes. with your idea, you have effectively crippled me as a pvper. you get to gank that raven, and i'll never get to pvp ever again. i think that is unfair. i will gladly have my most expensive ship ganked by a logon trap and loose all of my wealth before i allow my ability to enjoy the game crippled.if you want to make eve more realistic, fix the problems of those who lag and make the game more realistic for them too. if i can adapt with my unrealistic problem and enjoy my game, then you can adapt too. your proposal does not put in account everyone's situation and fails.not supported."
9/8/2009,"you can, at least if you go for a buffertank with extenders and harderners. ofcourse you have to put one power diagnostic on there but that leaves room for three magstabs and a dcu. if you have tackler support, load null and enjoy that 17km optimal."
9/8/2009,those are pretty expensive ways to die to a dominix
9/8/2009,"you honestly not going to put an mwd on that?anyway, to the op, its balanced, try getting a full rack of neutrons on a mega and see what kind of things you have to compromise on. oh, and train awu 5."
9/8/2009,"for empire and low sec it is not absolute nessesary, and the extra range + null helps a lot to be usefull without one in small gangs."
9/8/2009,you also see amarr and (shield tanked) minmatar ships without mwd often.
9/8/2009,"i agree with null, i just know from experience that not having an mwd will get you killed :) it's not about range to target, its about a lot of other situational things.you should really consider fitting one."
9/8/2009,its dumb to attempt to use a rokh like this
9/8/2009,until you get scrambled. no more mwd in that case and since i got blasters im gonna be pretty close in some way.
9/8/2009,"it's a better idea, that if a char with bounty is podded he will lose security status. so every pirate is avoiding to be podded."
9/8/2009,"i like the suggestions that are going on in this thread. if someone wrote it up into a coherent single post, i'd probably support it."
9/8/2009,"i think there is another way to fix the problem of people collecting their own bounties with alts.currently, having a bounty on your head is a bad thing unless you have an alt collect it. but what if having a bounty also had benefits? this would mean that people who want those benefits would actually try to keep the bounty on their head as long as possible and will even try to raise it. if they are shot, they have to start all over again with zero bounty. this means that collecting your own bounty may not be as tactically sound as keeping it there. this is well in-tune with the 'risk-reward' philosophy, as having a bounty on your head is a dangerous thing.the type of benefits a bounty gives you might include things like access to certain agents that require your bounty to be a certain amount or higher, or having a bounty-version of an lp-store. you might even go as far as having npc pirates not attack you if your bounty is high enough (as they start to 'respect' you) unless you fire at them first. the reward needs to measure up to the risks involved, and it may be difficult to find the right rewards for this, but i think it's a good solution if you want people to keep their bounties."
9/8/2009,"another thing you could do is to remove bounties on players and instead do killing on contract. the contract is created for one specific bounty-hunter by an investor. only that one specific bounty-hunter can fullfill the contract and collect the reward. bounty-hunters would need a specific bulletin board where they offer their services, a board that can be browsed through from anywhere in eve. so investors can pick their bounty-hunter, who may have specified a minimum fee, and when the investor picks one, the bounty-hunter receives an eve-mail with the target's name and the amount he can gain is also specified in the mail. contracts have a time limit. if the 'victim' is not killed within that time, the investor gets his money back from the unfullfilled contract, and the bounty-hunter nolonger has killrights on the target."
9/8/2009,"i don't like this idea, and i won't support it. my main problem is that for some reason people seem to think only trustworthy individuals (high security status) should be allowed to be bounty hunters.i know it's not the same universe, but it's probably still comparable: in star wars, many bounty hunters such as boba fett were not necessarily good, law abiding people (he worked with jaba).this idea sounds like turning bounty hunters into cops with very stiff mechanics and, on top of that, much better suggestions have been made regarding the bounty system in the past. go support those."

9/8/2009,great idea.
9/8/2009,"i have been thinking of proposing an idea roughly like this but with some small differences that i'd like some feedback onthe corp ceo could flag items as ""corp items"" that anyone in the corp can use however they like but they can't be sold given in a trade to someone outside the corp or put into contracts outside the corp. however when somebody leaves the corp, the game searches though their belongings looking for corp items and all of them have to be put back into the corp hangar before they can join a new corp.this could also work for the corp wallet where eve keeps a tally of the isk going between your wallet and the corp wallet, you can get as big a debt as you like, but when you want to leave you have to repay your debt to the corp wallet. this debt can be reduced by the ceo if they feel happy about the ex-member leaving before the debt is paid.that wouldn't stop people just trashing your corps assets, but then you just be careful of new players which could be alts.what do you think?"
9/8/2009,ccp already has devs working as investigators and proudly exclaiming they hold the record for 'highest number of bannings'.
9/8/2009,"speak for yourself. more seriously, make sure the limit isn't too draconian. someone might legitimately want to make two new topics inside an hour."
9/8/2009,"perhaps this has simply not been implemented due to the tediousness of the task, but it seems to me that factions which are not amarr/minmatar/caldari/gallente do not give out storyline missions. (i.e. ore, the syndicate, interbus, servant sisters of eve, thukker tribe, and pirate factions.)now i haven't checked them all, and haven't done missions for pirate factions since 2 years ago or more, but i am pretty certain that interbus faction (for example) does not give out storyline missions.that means that these factions (which do give out missions, unlike the jove empire and the society) can only have standing with them raised indirectly via the major factions. however since the caldari only like interbus to 1.50 that is the maximum that one would be able achieve, and at x0.15 times the rate at which caldari would increase, it would be very slow to get there anyway.there seems no major reason to specifically deny these mission (but not storyline) giving factions storyline missions. since they are liked only to a small degree by most major factions anyway the indirect increases would be small and max out at 0.25 to 3.00 anyway.personally i would love to see an additional mechanic added to the game that allowed faction standing increases besides storyline missions, especially since it is so easy to destroy faction standing. obviously the idea to make faction standing increase with agent and corp, but to an even smaller degree, has been thought of, probably by the designers who worked out the current standing rewards for missions, so we would need some ingenious new mechanic."
9/8/2009,"eh?ore, the syndicate, not sure but i think they have storyline agentsinterbus, they have no storyline agents because they are on good standing with all the empire faction and raising all the empire faction at the same time is a no-noservant sisters of eve, thukker tribe, and (all the) pirate factions have storyline agents."
9/8/2009,"with the proliferation of titans i think the proposed changes in dominion will not be liked by larger alliances or people with titans. the leak of this information before the pax conference also explains why titans have dropped in price and are being sold and raffled left-and-right.hopefully they will also provide another function for them in fleet warfare. the ""cost"" to manufacture titan's including minerals and 10% profit on the required bpo's is in the ballpark of 49-51b /w current mineral prices. you are taking a ship that is very expensive to build and removing it's primary ability that is unique (black ops have covert bridge). i can only hope that there will be something added to the strategic capabilities of the most powerful super-capital in the game."
9/8/2009,that is the problem it never was 1v1 a dread could kill a titan
9/8/2009,"yes it has, but it hasn't changed the fact that this is the wrong proposal for a comparatively minor problem. yes, the system is broken (t2 ships not working plus only 3 month limited coverage). however, this will only force people like myself who have a rl plus eve to buy isk. i don't have the time or the patience to farm isk like some kind of zombie... no thanks."

9/8/2009,"i do understand the wardec system and all. the good and bad points of it. i read some threads regarding the changes and all but i believe theres one thing thats missing and now wondered.just out of curiosity, if a corp (the wardeccer) doesn't attack at all. shouldn't that constitute the violation of the yulai convention (from the evemail i get thats what it says anyway). in other words, since they dont attack for x number of days why should the wardec continue ? also to note that in this situation even thought it may be wierd, the wardecced started the wardec, there intention is to almost never attack...just terrorise i guess; or always have the feeling they might. i don't mean to change anything just to get some feedback on this."

9/9/2009,"show me a ship other than a caldari missile boat that losses its damage bonus at any point when using the racial weapon systems designed for that vessel.you may not mention helios,inquisitor,breacher,eris or any of the stelth bombers.they are included in the op."
9/9/2009,"i seem to be in the minority on this: i think that dust 514 is a brilliant idea.i don't think that sovereignty will be solely in the hands of a bunch of 12-year-old mouth-breathers. the winners will be those alliances that work closely with skilled groups of dust 514 players. they will have an impact, but they can't do it without us."

9/9/2009,"while lower insurance (and fewer rr bses, for that matter) means less pvp, it also means much higher quality of pvp. reduction of insurance will mean more diversity, and it will reduce the desire for pilots to stay away from purchasing t2 ships. it will also remove the incentive to make the all-too-common disposable battleships we all love to see.supported.(oddly enough, my proposal had way fewer supports, even though the changes were fewer. i wonder why )"
9/9/2009,"one reason i support this is because it increases costs for griefers in highsec. now, griefing is pvp, but there are many of them who are purposefully in a noob corp so they cannot be war-decced, which as you know is also part of pvp. there should be repercussions for every action in eve, and the additions yaay has added will increase costs for griefing regardless of corp. these are my reasons for supporting yaay's additions, but it could very well be that insurance is the wrong way to do it, in which case those additions should be removed."

(also, it's buggy, this leads to a cyno that never dies until downtime and your spawning in your medical station, but you still keep your clone which is awesome when you have a ton of skillpoints)"

9/9/2009,"i will not go into complete detail on the mechanic of this exploit, but after talking to several sources and testing, we have conclude yet another instance of pos bowling exploiting.similar to one that occurred about 6 months ago, after the ban hammer threat was tossed out, it is now time for ccp to take legit and harsh action against this.i want to be the first to say, i fully endorse meta gaming, and the actions that result from it. what i do not support is exploiting the game mechanics beyond fair rules. pos bowling is one of the lamest tactics ever invented, and sadly i have a history with the founders of it. yet up until it was deemed bannable, i accepted it's use. what irks me greatly is that an outcry from a large portion of the game and a resulting stiff warning from the devs has not resulted in any real action since, even with multiple cases petitioned and confirmed.under the most recent incident, it was used in a manner to prevent the pilot from having a chance to log off or recover from the action and warp or move to a safe spot in the shields in time. had bowling not been used, i'd consider the kill fully legit.screenshots, petitions, and convos have been recorded confirming the foul play which will be dealt with through proper resources, but action needs to be taken swiftly and harshly to make the statement to players that this will not be tolerated.idle threats towards my past alliances should not be discriminated only against the bob ilk, it's time to call an exploit an exploit and not discriminate simply because we didn't like one alliance for doing it.there are 3 confirmed ways to ignore intended game mechanics to prevent bowling. 2 of them do not require a pos pw at all, the 3rd way requires an exploit of the pw system that does not involve the pos owners at all. all 3 ways directly counter mechanics placed in game to prevent bowling. bowling is not bumping. having a pos pw and bumping a ship out or having the tower pw changed to create ejections results in bumping. bumping is an avoidable mechanic that gives both parties options on using and avoiding it.bowling creates artificial unattainable speeds resulting in extraordinary physics outside of normal game mechanics. it is done compeletely against the will of the pos owner, meaning no pw change. bowling results in actions that cannot be countered by the tower owners."

9/9/2009,"no pos pw change occurred. it involves direct warp into the tower and instant bounce out of the shields. capital ships were used, but not required for the effect. beyond that, to go into the exact pos exploit mechanic is i believe against eula and to talk directly about a petition content is the same. i do not care about the loss of the ship, the guy who lost it had it coming. i only care about the exploit itself."
9/9/2009,"my heart bleeds over this, really, it does."
9/9/2009,you've just discovered this now?this thread is bleeds of irony.
9/9/2009,ummmm
9/9/2009,"mazz isn't really a girl, and got on csm for that reason only.... i'm petitioning thatedit- game-over respeckt supports"
9/9/2009,"ooo, my own assembly hall thread.pretty simple, mazz. it's a far cry more simple than your exploiting of the training multiple chars several months ago while it existed. (ps - tell us how you're not an ugly girl so i can link to contradictory proof)"
9/9/2009,"be smart.perhaps you need a button on pos, ""anchoring my ship here"" and that's make it immobile like the dread in siege.need anchoring iv and 1 minutes."
9/9/2009,"there are a lot more than three ways to pos bowl illegally under current game mechanics, most if not all of them have been bugreported for over six months now."
9/9/2009,"what's most frustrating is that with petitions in, they get closed with the response that an investigation is underway. this should be a public knowledge issue. there is so much gray area in rules because gm's and devs do not open up the issues to the public. with a close petition, how can i keep an open flow of information to see if action was taken, or if the incident was passed on. how do i get the option of escalating what i think is a perma bannable offense if a regular gm does not handle the issue adequately.the reason threadnaughts happen is because the gm policies are total garbage for things like this.i can assure you if this is not handled properly, i will take every opportunity to repeat the incident until we have another goonesq response to the outrageousness of this bull****. at the very least, information on par with the pos indy exploit needs to be handed out. types and numbers of bans need to be listed for exactly what the offense was on issues such as this so that players can reference them in the future, and a database needs to be compiled on previous history of bans for said actions.i would petition or have petitioned all groups friend and foe alike for actions like this. i strongly discourage it even though i strongly encourage metagaming. viper:pl was petitioned on the basis of using the borked capital mass bumping issue to the extent to create pos bowling mechanics. same effect, same unintended feature, different cause.that issue was resolved when ship on ship bumping mechanics were fixed.had i been aware of bob using them as i've been informed they did and publicly educated members on very recently, they would have received the same treatment. i'm all for winning at whatever cost, no matter how gay some tactics are, but i do expect tactics to be within the rules and that the rules apply equally to all parties.the eula clearly states that knowingly using bugs to your advantage is a bannable exploit, and that is the issue addressed here."
9/9/2009,irony overload!this incident wasnt bowling and the nyx owner died of his own mistakes. that being said ccp did not fix the bowling concept i agree and it should be looked into. you should probably have posted this with a alt as people will accuse you of hypocrisy and just because of that many will not suport this idea.
9/9/2009,"i support this,pos bowling is pr0 g*y-good thing we didnt do that"
9/9/2009,"so... what your saying is we killed your nyx alt?pos bowling... suuuuuuuuure.please take those tears to jita 4-4, snot shot needs more water to wash windows."
9/9/2009,"yaay? a hypocrite? say it isn't so!pos bowling should be fixed though, but as far as i can tell the ms kill in question was nothing of the sort."
9/9/2009,not supported because yaay dying is hilarious.
9/9/2009,"that whole comment kinda makes you look a little stupid. i dont know the story of how he died, the way he flew it was bound to happen eventually. but i am supporting it as the issue at hand does need to be looked into"
9/9/2009,"phreeze, i love a good yaay loss as much as the next, so much so that i think we need to post our favorite yaay losses. however, this wasn't yaay. yaay can't afford motherships."
9/9/2009,i personally love that one where yaay is in the covops...
9/9/2009,"i have fraps of ze mothership kill in question, you can have it for 20 billionz isk!"
9/9/2009,"i am interested in seeing this for posterity, and posterity alone; therefore all i can offer is this smiley face and knowledge to help better inform the public and the csm"
9/9/2009,"i vote to reinstate it as a proper mechanic, i mean its good sport"
9/9/2009,no.and fyi those speeds are still attainable in game through conventional means.
9/9/2009,"i hear the recording of you emo raging that you missed the kill is almost as funny as the build-up to what happen next. if you listen closely, you can almost hear the pitter patter of your mom's steps coming down to the basement to assist you in a southparkesq manner. i'll leave it to the gm's to decide that isolated matter, but for the game mechanic as a whole, i'd like for clarity and consistency of rule."
9/9/2009,we have a screenie of the gm telling a posbowl exploiting tri nyx pilot to quit it and leave system a couple of months ago.
9/9/2009,you mean when you engage warp to tower with correct pos pw in then change while in warp ?
9/9/2009,so? do you mean to suggest that that means this was a bowl incident aswell? if one person did it then the whole alliance must do it? by that logic all of kia are made up of scammers since eddz scammed evebank.
9/9/2009,"it's -esque, you twit."
9/9/2009,"so what you're saying is that rapiers are solo ships and should never, ever fly with an arazu beside them? because if you are, i'll just point out that a rapier can pretty trivially slow a ship down by 87.5%, which is a bigger penalty than a mwd is a bonus. would you rather turn off a mwd, or turn off the bonus and keep the penalty?"
9/9/2009,using an afterburner instead of a mwd is kind of like perma-webbing yourself.
9/9/2009,"abs are fitted to make tanking easier rather then to move fast, and frigs with ab is pretty common now. the small sig combined with high speed and no scram effect really is nice."
9/9/2009,when you died with a ceptor due to the 2pt scram multiple times you put an ab on to counter those.
9/9/2009,"oh i've read it, i just don't agree with you.what you're suggesting results in exactly the same underbidding except people would be forced to under-bid by 1 tick instead of 1 cent.so now every 5 minutes i miss out on 0.10 or 1.00 or 100.00 or 10,000,000.00.i still have to under-bid if i want to sell fast, your proposal changes nothing in that respect.currently if people want to sell *now*, then they have to baby-sit their orders, while those who can wait are able to set a price and walk away. the market moves a great deal each day and for most products it's possible to sell low volume at high margin or high volume at low margin depending on your choice and the availability of time.yes your proposal would make things move faster and further, however this would be forced by the tick rather then forced by the market. things move fast enough with 1<U+FFFD> increments, if you want to sell *now* then adjust your orders to suit like your competition is.edit: formatting... long lines are harder to read"
9/9/2009,"that would be true only if each and any of those cent-cutters would be willing to cut by a full tick.i think only a small minority is really willing, most are doing their undercutting only because it is free.can't you see how abnormal is that? in a funtional market, if you want to sell *now*, you have togive a sizeable discount. as tick rule is part of an analogous real life market (like a commodity exchange), whatever is forced by the tick is forcedby the market. but seriously, if there is a sell pressure, then the natural logic dictated by the market is that the price goes down. ppl cutting by the penny do nothing else than prevent the move that the market would force on the price. ok, not really preventing, just slowing down. however, there are buy pressures as well. normally prices wouldmove up and down, up and down, as the wind blows. with pennying hidering the price movement, a sell pressuremay have not enogh time to see the price plummet, because soon a buy pressure kick is. similarly, a buy pressure probably cant raise the price either, because sooner or later a sell pressure kicks in. we are missing a lot of volatility here.what is volatility good for? it provides a lot of opportunity to make good bargins for clever buyers and sellers alike, also for speculators to make quick kills. naturally, this money comes out from the pocket of ppl who are greedy, panicked, desperatly need the good/money, or a just plane lame. taking advantge of others situation or stupidity is as old as the stock market. in eve, call it ""market pvp"" if you like"
9/9/2009,"supportedbelt marker is a virtual object, only perceptible through the use of superimposed hud simbology. there's no corresponding physical object (like a beacon), hence there should be no decloaking.only workaround is to have belts displayed in overview, toggle tactical display on, click on belt marker at the end of the warp, and try to fly away from it. this way you avoid decloak 90% of the time even warping to zero."
9/9/2009,"warp to zero on other celestials like stars, planets, and moons don't trigger this, nither should an asteroid belt."
9/9/2009,get rid of it.
9/9/2009,this very bug makes me very very sad as a dedicated recon pilot.
9/9/2009,"make non gallente rookieships more in line with their roles.i'm sure i cannot be the first to make this proposal, but i can't be bothered with searching for them.needless to say i think this has been one of the biggest sources of imbalance in eve for as long as i have been playing. the velator has, and always will be king of rookieship battles hands down. with it's massive drone bay and ridiculous gun bonus, it can't be ignored when on a battlefield of many.some people disagree citing the reaper as an obvious speed tanker, but when it's dps is so laughable that it can barely solo an industrial, who out there can really claim it to be one of the elite hulls in frigate warfare today? not only that, but should you use the ship for that purpose, you sacrifice your shield and armor for something that cannot even outrun a drone.the ibis is just a joke. clearly intended as a mix between a sniper and a shield tanker, it barely has the pg to support these vital functions. it obviously has an issue with tanking and maintaining transversal at the same time, unlike the armor based variants, causing it to become overcome mercilessly should it encounter a frontal collisionlastly, i'd like to bring up the imparior. it has a well spread distribution of armor resistances making it a solid choice when you don't know what you may encounter. however, like so many amarr ships, it has a critical flaw in it's bonus list. the reduced capacitor consumption of it's racial weapon variant. it causes one to make the choice between using a decent midrange weapon with no damage bonus, or go all out on dps with a full rack of light ion blasters.i now present to you the velator, in all its solopwnmobile glory. not only are it's weapon systems the most lethal in game, but as mentioned earlier, it has a drone bay 100% larger than that belonging to any of the other ships mentioned. that, my friends, it 100% more dps that has no way of being jammed, neuted, or disrupted, making it an unstoppable onslaught of raw power. the tank, as with many gallentean ships, can go both as an armor tank, shield tank, or hull tank. endless configurations for each. this makes it not just tough to crack but unpredictable to even the most wary pvper.when we get over those shock inducing realizations, we take a look at the ship bonus. 5% bonus to hybrid damage right? that's per level folks. while many have not the skills to maximize the damage potential, select few have indeed invested into training this juggernaut to the fullest. ""facemelting...raw carnage...rocket chainsaw"" all phrases used to describe the ferocity of this ship, thus concluding my segment on the velator.i'm not going to say i know the best way to get around this crippling game changer, unless to suggest raising your children as gallenteans, but i do know this. one day it could be you staring down the twin barrels of this behemoth, as it's hive mind wingmen cascade upon you with hellfire, and then you will realize how disturbingly true this problem really is.tl;dr, boost non gallente gratuitous frigates"
9/9/2009,"this is a tragic and highly frustrating imbalance, and should be treated with the highest priority possible."
9/9/2009,sure. but first introduce a reason to fly an eris. or a phobos. or a hyperion. and a better reason to fly a thanatos. or a nyx.
9/9/2009,you must be kidding.1. eris ok. not so nice. but try a pure missile dictor for real pain. or even one with rocket bonuses (rockets are the most useless weapon system in eve atm).2. phobos. lowsec gate campers best friend? good active tank with place for 2 sensor boosters to catch everything that passes through.3. hyperion. may i recommend darknesss videos? nice solo/small gang ship with a very strong active tank.4. thanatos. yeah i would also hate to have the carrier with the highest damage output. same goes for the nyx. it sucks so much to have 25% more damage than all other carriers/motherships.i give you a big box of tissues and the op a not supported.whine about rookie ships *facepalms*
9/9/2009,you should have put this as topic:because your topic is really too complimentarily racial equalized amongst itself.
9/9/2009,"i find the biggest issue i'm having with the 2 second delay is having to hover over the button for 2 seconds before hitting it again. it may be cutting down on lag but to those operating in wormholes or outside of highsec, this thing is your eyes. and it's just tedious. so, how about having a tickbox next to the button that when clicked automatically hits the scan button every 2 seconds while the scanning window is open (and putting in a 5 minute auto-switch off so people can't just leave it running afk and adding unnecessary scan lag to the system). maybe even put in a bit of animation so it at least looks like it's sweeping the entire system and reporting every 2 seconds instead of the 'scanner is recalibrating' nonsense. basically ccp has made it appear that the scanner is slower and stupider, and that should be easily rectified. hell, the ""dradus"" scanner on bsg sweeps the area and updates every couple of seconds, but at least it looks like it's working as it should"
9/9/2009,supporting my own post yeah
9/9/2009,"""[idea] balanced fix for directional scan""nice topic. the only down side to it is that it isn't actually fixing the scanner is it. you just automate the scanner and leave it just as broken as it is today. read the threadnaught on this forum about it and you can see how this would not actually fix the issues people have with the directional scanner. i also fail to see how this is a balanced solution, since you didn't balance anything. as for the idea of an option to automate the process, i have no strong feelings either way. it would be pretty useless for actually trying to determine the location of someone in a hurry, but if you are just doing a 360 degree scans to see who is around, it would remove the need for constant mouse clicking and let you focus on playing."
9/9/2009,"every character would have the attribute , as at some point they might use faction/t2 crystals.thats a non issue , characters have hundreds if not thousands of attributes allready.its just a counter to prevent randomness destroying all crystals at once.i would go for just the one attribute for all crystal types, but that would be a dev decision if they thought it would be a good idea to implement.it would be checked with the exact same regularity that crystal dmage is applied to crystals at present.all the idea does is move the counter from the crystal ( crystal damage attribute ) to the player ( crystalpop attribute ).server load would not be affected.the attribute would only be altered when a volatile crytals is loaded as is the case atm with crystal damage."
9/9/2009,i prefered the random shatter method too.but it was not garnering enough support though and i'd rather see some solution for crystals than non at all
9/9/2009,"what happens to your 'timer' when you change crystals from one type to another? .. nothingwhat happens if i have a high 'crystalpop' value and change from a bs to a frigate? does my small lazer get a high pop to begin with?..the ""crystalpop"" attribute is on the player not the laser.changing ship would not affect it.even funnier, what happens when i change from my miner with t2 mining crystals to my bs with faction crystals...again no change to the player attirbute crystalpopand what happens if i exchange a t2 crystal for a 'normal' t1 crystal?..the counter ""crystalpop"" would not change if t1 crystals were fitted as per the op."
9/9/2009,"thanks for the support.just to answer some of your concerns.- extra data(ok minor with only one atribute, but not any player uses lasers)each skill a player has can be considered an attribute, i'd bet there are other hidden attribs as wellrelated to booster and other stuff. i dont think adding one extra is gonna be an issue at all.and for every attribute that is added onto a player , there will be hundreds of attributes ( crystal damage ) removed from the crystals in play , so overall the dbase will probably end up smaller.- you will need a spare crystal any time since the damage carryies over between shipstrue this is the con.- you will lose more isk in pvp with it, since you lose 1 crystal any 10 minutes instead 5 after 50 minutes -> if you lose your ship after 40 minutes firing you allrady had to burn thrue 4 crystals, in the corrent scenario you are still with your first set of crystals cost to pvp is hard to guage, yeah the loss of spare crystals will be a small cost , but is ofset by the fact that you dont have to discard badly damaged crystals and also any you get in loot will be new , so you can use them or resale.- you could fire some shots with a s crystal to prevent your xl crystal from getting destroyed(ok comedy issue), since the price diffrence between scorch and faction amno isn<U+FFFD>t this big no real issuepossible , but i think players who are this concerned about losing isk generally dont pvp in the first place.seperate counters on the player for each crystal type would remove this possibliity although i dont think it would be worth the effort.on the code level you could simply destroy the crystal in the gun after firing, if the value hits zero, then reset it. since there are no unrepacked crystals any more you could even use the block standard reloading like other weaons do while ungrouped(if the gun runs out of amno it realoads automaticly with the same amno type if it is stored in the cargo, what isn<U+FFFD>t possible with unrepacked amno atm).destroying the crystal in a gun would be an issue as pointed out by a previous poster.currently lasers keep firing till all the crystals blow more or less at once.i wanted a method that would keep lasers firing without interuption as only this would be acceptable to most amarr as it is what they have atm."
9/9/2009,n1
9/9/2009,"i read scrapheap, it tells a different story in his own words. he's a ****, i'm for extending his ban permanently.that said, ccp are ******ed for giving the csm any kind of info they can abuse."
9/9/2009,permaban him
9/9/2009,15 days - 30 days? thats a joke he should be permanently banned period. what he did is the samething equivelent to what t20 did. he needs a permanent ban.they also should investigate everyone who is posting in this thread that seem to have a vested interest in getting larkonis unbanned. how far does this breech go? we the eve community deserve answers.
9/9/2009,oh go phone someones home or post personal information in local about it..... oh wait.
9/9/2009,"another csm member breaking the rules?<U+FFFD># warnings and bans are not to be discussed on the forum. such matters shall remain private between the ccp and the user. questions or comments concerning warnings and bans will be conveyed through e-mail or private messaging. likewise, discussions regarding moderator actions are not permitted on the forum. if you have questions regarding a post or thread, please file a petition."
9/9/2009,"ban him, and keep him banned. it's bad enough we have corruption in rl politics."
9/9/2009,u mad~
9/9/2009,<U+FFFD>u mad
9/9/2009,i agree banif lark did care about this he would never of done it in the first place and he knew what was happening so he messed up and he needs to pay for it
9/9/2009,"supporting this because it was p. hilarious and made me giggle. you can't just ban a man that made you giggle, u kno? well, you can, technically. and i suppose him being banned is kinda funny, too. so i'm good either way."
9/9/2009,"ccp goes too easy on these people.people that cheat are one thing, people that cheat and use their position to cheat are another.perma ban is in order.... never to return."
9/9/2009,"not supported. a permenant ban is necessary.or are the csm oh so lofty that they are above the rules?edit: it's hilarious that the support for this is from other csm members. afraid the rug is about to pulled out from under you, eh?"
9/9/2009,"30 days from game, and what i hope is a lifetime from csm? sounds about right to me. anyone acting that fundamentally stupid deserves no less. he shouldn't have been flying what he couldn't afford to lose."
9/9/2009,"lol its just a game, unban him and reinstate him. only ***s and queers think that this is a ""loss of trust"" blah blah. its not like he will do it again. i guess it was probably just a brain fart."
9/9/2009,and real life harrasment is not worth being perma banned for?
9/9/2009,ahahahahahaha
9/9/2009,free my beloved malarky.
9/9/2009,"so let me get this straight...we have a csm breaking the rules - a csm everyone knew was an asshat and a pirate when he got elected. uh. who else saw this coming? ffs people what did you expect?i am also not surprised that the request to unban him comes from the member of the csm who's campaign slogan could basically be reduced to ""vote for me, i have boobs.""disband the csm. it's lost it's meaning and sense of purpose - we are officially better off without it."
9/9/2009,this minus the disbanding bit.try elect people with brains... like hersch and company. : o p
9/9/2009,"i agree.. and i think maybe (as much as i hate to admit it) that when the cosmos social networking stuff arrives we might be able to get a better read on what candidates are really like. honestly, the current csm group has not performed well at all. some of the ideas i've seem our precious csm reps post this term have been dumber than the ones i post while ****ed off, half asleep, having a nicotine fit, and going through a caffeine withdrawal migraine.time needs to be served, and while i somewhat respect the openness thats going on about the case, i really expected a longer ban than 30 flipping days."
9/9/2009,first of all... if you think lark is dumb you don't know lark.secondly..... the csm can't do anything that is not ccp aproved. so their hands are tied....
9/9/2009,"lark's a good guy, and a smart one. supported.itt: negative ten and their alts qqing because they want to ease the burden on themselves by keeping their primary rival banned..."
9/9/2009,"well, goons were the ones least willing to forgive bob over the t20 stuff etc. we are your nemesis ingame, and had your exploit worked, your corp standed to gain tens if not hundreds of billions of isk. in one night, 2 chars in your corp had put 5 b into it...how much more would be in it before the patch came through. that money would have been used to offset the war between us....and any future competitors.i feel that ccp would have permabanned lark if he were in any 0.0 alliance because of the pressure from the competitors of that alliance over the outrage of them essentially cheating in the race. as much as you want lark to come back to hold your hand ingame again, im angry that he tried to pull this ****.....so yeah everyone in this thread is playing from their point of view, including the girl that lark ""bought a drink""...lark wanted their to be more attention to be paid to low sec, in that spirit his cheating shouldnt be looked on as less of a game changing exploit that would have ruined the game for others. try for a little integrity ccp instead of giving in to some smooth talking douche thats gloating on scrapheap right now about your impotence in punishing him."
9/9/2009,how is he smart again?
9/9/2009,"after reading what this person larkonis trassler did, i must say i am surprised he didn't get a perma-ban. he is well deserving of it in my opinion. he used inside information to try and gain an advantage, he also signed a non-disclosure agreement which he violated, and from what i've been told his main character was banned from the forums for 6 months for inappropriate posting. i feel this person is non-rehabilitative and should be banned not only on principle but on his past digressions. integrity is something i feel ccp should show in this matter. my vote is a permanent ban of larkonis trassler and all his accounts as well as a permanent ban from the csm.ban him we don't need people like this in eve."
9/9/2009,just enforce the rules in place without any bias or favoritism. /end thread
9/9/2009,"where to start where to start.... well, t20 kept his job. the money was not going to the neo spartans corp. i have seen far more serious offenses be overlooked by ccp so a perma ban would be out of the question if you look at those. thirdly, how has this effected your game experience in any way, shape or form? if lark was able to make a profit and not get caught your experience would not change at all, you would still run whenever there are more than three of us in a group. and also, about integrity. **** off. you are in a corp controlled by a man who has gone as far to make three harassing phone calls to another player and has posted personal info of players in local chat."
9/9/2009,"i like your logic, a perma ban would be out of the question because of vague references to worse things you have seen go unpunished....well sir i would suggest you file a petiton to help resolve those unpunished offences and help ccp to have a more fair and consistent policy for enforcing rules.do your part."
9/9/2009,this.
9/9/2009,him and all his known alts should be perma banned.
9/9/2009,spending a bit of isk on some insider information is clearly worse than rl threats and harassment right? just too bad ccp cant/wont act on things that happen out of game.
9/9/2009,"we are discussing the cold hard facts of what lark did in iceland this week, and whether he was deserving of a lighter punishment. i responded that i do not feel that he deserves a lighter punishment, infact it deserves a harsher punishment. pls stop responding with off topic replies about different incidents/ and or/ make another thread/ and or/ file a petition.you were more than happy to talk about the topic at hand when everyone was supporting lark's punishment being halfed, why the smokeshow now?"
9/9/2009,"it seems to me there is alot more to this than meets the eye. while we sit here reading this thread larkonis is gloating and bragging in the scrapheap challenge forums about how he pulled one over on ccp. how he basically wiggled his way into a measely 30 day ban. after reading his comments on scrapheap i feel he hasn't learned a thing from his given punishment. i also see from his posts that he thinks it's funny, he has no remorse for what he did. he even makes a comment about how he hopes that ccp doesn't notice that his statement was actually a troll.i think the ban-hammer needs to be smacked down on this guy like the hammer of thor on loki's head.here is the link for all of you that want to see how unremorseful this guy is:"
9/9/2009,"i don't see anything out of line in that shc thread. he seems pretty reasonable and genuinely sorry about what he did. you, on the other hand, come off as a stilted united alt on a quest for blood. get out."
9/9/2009,maximum irony overload hahahahahahaha
9/9/2009,"remorseless? everything i've seen him post has been along the lines of ""i screwed up, ccp was merciful, i think we got some good things done.""i don't have a dog in this fight, but you're flat out lying."
9/9/2009,"who's lark, ban anderson williams imo."
9/9/2009,"you sir, must have been reading a different thread than i do at the exact same link.to the topic:30days is already easy on him as he could have been perma banned, so sadly i have to vote no to a reduction to 15 days."
9/9/2009,"i strongly disagree. despite of truly liking lark on nongay way i was advocating permament ban of all his accounts for the ""stuff"" he did. but thats just me"
9/9/2009,"sorry, but that's well worth a permaban."
9/9/2009,permaban the cheating ****
9/9/2009,"pointing towards specific posts may be more useful. hardly anyone is going to read the entire thread, and at least the first few pages seem harmless enough.anyway, what he did deserves what he got.it would set a bad example for others if the ban were rescinded. you can bet that soon others would follow, knowing that they'd merely have to fake repentance to get off easy, if caught at all."
9/9/2009,permaban account & trash the character for good measure. end of discussion.
9/9/2009,"initial response, page 2 page 4page 4i only read the 1st 4 pages and found enough evidence to prove that were dealing with an idiot, who cant handle their drink, that after their initial reply has quickly resorted to using slang and personal attacks.csm is a wonderful thing, no?"
9/9/2009,"as you can read in the blog, larkonis used insider trading, it was quickly discovered. his accounts were then frozen for investigation and whatever assets he gained from the transactions have been stripped from his accounts.there was no significant effect on the market as a whole, and ultimately no personal gain. that is how far it went."
9/9/2009,"this is pretty hilarious in a way. anyways, lark fulfilled all my expectations except for the getting caught part, that was just stupid. supporting this.(also, kinda nice to see ccp actually monitor certain things a bit closer than expected, which we wouldn't know if it wasn't for lark)"
9/9/2009,"while i have no personal intereset in larkonis trassler being banned i think ccp should set the tone right to prevent further cases like this.if the worst people got to fear is a 30d ban, it is highly likely someone is gonna try it gain. maybe a bit better prepared, with a few friends actually do the trading instead of himself.therefore i think it was bad decision not to perma ban the character."
9/9/2009,"not at all. it was clear like the sun that he was breaking the law. he got our votes, and tried to take an economical advantage from this, and that's a shame.ccp discovered him and he said ""i'm sorry""? oh my god, you are sorry. and what if ccp didn't discover him? he was not ""a man"", he was a chairman of the csm and must behave.his attempt was stupid and bad. he deserves a permanent ban. he should have sent his characters to the biomass prcessing queue for the shame."
9/9/2009,"no disagreement on the bolded parts. or the rest, actually.but overall i think his replies are decent enough. maybe i'm too used to reading internet forums by now, and filter too much.to me it reads as if he simply acknowledges that he's an idiot, not trying to cover it or play it down."
9/9/2009,"he got caught so he has to pay, be smarter next time it's sad because he was oen of the few interesting candidates this term bringing issues and stuff. 2.5 bill is pocket money too, a shame."
9/9/2009,"he has complicated my life beyond measure, kept me from being in iceland when the sun came up and kept the discussion of fixing low sec, my favorite topic without a champion, so i vote perma-ban!trak! you owe me a nonnies lamb sub!!!!!issler/ellan thrace"

9/9/2009,"in his defence, she was hideous."
9/9/2009,abusing trust given should be harshly punished.
9/9/2009,"ban.many pilots just want to use tricky and dirty play in eve, because the ccp, csm and others left them.corp stole, ally disband, afk cloak, cloak mwd, no cloaked ship scanner, scammers, corrupt alliance and corp leaders, station huggers, thiefs, pos bumpers, logoffsky etc.many players will tell this: ""this is the part of game."" realy ? dishonour. lolpart of game, when he got a high position and accepted a contract he forget the rules ? this is not the part of game.what happend now, csm want to bring back a member who, cheat,stole etc.that was the second mistake and not first, but csm member who wrote this petition dont want to told for common players this.he bought an alliance tourny slot for isk and when got the money , he dont give to customer the slot.looks so a reliable csm member.dear mazzilliu why dont tell this information for the players too ?for you the most important thing ""good behavior he demonstrated by buying the rest of us several rounds of drinks"" lolfirst thing not the honour and the players of game in your position ? (if we talk about the game and not from the real life)"
9/9/2009,"unban larkonis! this game needs more metagamers and cheaters!but seriously, did anyone expect anything different from this dude? a c&p clown elected by c&p clowns and their alts ."
9/9/2009,"what? we didn't buy any at slot for isk, we got into at fair and square. we sold it for isk but then kept the slot, which is known as scamming. if you have a problem with scamming, you might want to go find a different game to play, as there's no problems with it here."
9/9/2009,"hideous or not - spit roast? wtf? we're not slabs of ****ing beef. normally i don't play the feminist role very well (i like to cook, and i actually enjoy cleaning as long as someone else does the laundry) but if some guy actually said this to me in a bar i would plant my foot so far up his ass they'd have to amputate it at the knee to get it out.ffs, ban him, ban all his alts, ban anything that's ever connected from his ip address, and biomass the lot. he's a repugnant cad."
9/9/2009,"calm downsome people enjoy that, you dont speak for women everywhere..."
9/9/2009,"posting again in a thread that by rule should not exist and started by a csm. just remember the lesson we learned today children, if you buy fat chicks a drink, sign legal documents and break the agreement, use insider information for personal gain, you too can suck enough icelandic **** and get away with it."
9/9/2009,"now that it has been proven there are exceptions to ccp's rules i have an idea. every time any you lose a ship to lag or desync and you petition only to get the ""we show nothing in our logs"", simply reply to the gm with a link to the dev blog, this thread and offer to buy them a drink. according to recent events, you should promptly receive your ship back."
9/9/2009,"he's honestly lucky he didn't get permabanned tbh. what he did is a gross exploitation of ccp and every legit player in this game. the more important question here is ""why is his ban only temporary?"". i don't understand what makes him better than the average player. if i betrayed ccp's trust and exploited the market and playerbase like he did, would i get the same treatment? you guys don't know me, and i'm sure the op of this thread would be tossing a torch under my stake just like the rest of you. it doesn't matter if he was in the csm, or if he makes you giggle, or is a good guy. he's a paying customer just like the rest of us. if a world leader is convicted of murder, should he/she get a reduced sentence? this doesn't seem right to me.favoritism fails.not supported simply because no one is better than the rest of us."
9/9/2009,he did something he was not suppose to. he got caught. now he needs to do the time. let the ban run its course.
9/9/2009,and some women will let you get away with anything for a round of drinks.
9/9/2009,"does this mean you now support the thread to disband the csm instead of wanting it locked?if the initial tone of that thread offends you, feel free to start your own - which i would happily support.unless, of course, you'd rather be represented by populist manchildren whose attitudes to life and personal relationships have barely left the playground."
9/9/2009,"i support a permanent ban of larkonis trassler! i would like to see a csm proposal of permanently banning larkonis trassler and his accounts. larkonis trassler disgraced himself, the csm, ccp, and the entire eve community. his permanent ban should be in order."
9/9/2009,"he never bought the rest of us drinks... who he truly ****ed over with his massive betrayal. until i taste a beer paid for by him, i'm voting against this."
9/9/2009,"mazzi you're a joke, the csm is a joke, and that fat iceland chick told all her fat friends your **** is a joke."
9/9/2009,the message that the csm is giving us is that... hey... we can manipulate the game when we want... cause we only will be banned for 1 month... so...
9/9/2009,ticket to fanfest.harbor.???profit!
9/9/2009,epic fail on using your main account for the insider trade. come on you should have known better than that.
9/9/2009,why don't you post on your main maddog?
9/9/2009,"my only question.will this be dealt with?larkonis trassler, best trassler. free lark."
9/9/2009,the thread you mention was a proposal to disband the csm for doing what they were supposed to be doing (assuming they knew anything about dust 514 to begin with). this is a completely different can of worms. please don't confuse them.
9/9/2009,because my main is banned another 42 days for using the word tampon in a humorous way.
9/9/2009,im not supporting until i get some isk sent my way.isn't that how things work with him?
9/9/2009,i shall hold your support ransom for 5 billion isk.pay up or get your forum privileges podded.well that's how you chaps normally do it... right?
9/9/2009,while i could believe that he wasnt thinking and he couldnt remember where he knew that tidbit. so when he acted on the information... he then got banned because he was abusing knowledge.i sure as hell wouldnt support unbanning him though.
9/9/2009,such a fuss over just a couple billions...geez. get the poor guy out of the ban.
9/9/2009,ban the whole csm!
9/9/2009,"+1 for acting quickly to capitalize an opportunity-1 for not realizing it was an inside opportunity+1 for open honest confession-1 for not confessing till after it was discoveredlooks even to me, let him back into the game there is work to be done.edit: p"
9/9/2009,"wasn't too unexpected. i'd still vote for him, he still seems to get the game better than most out there. lets give him another chance (this time do an epic haul, 4-5 bil is pretty meh)"
9/9/2009,impersonating a ccp employee is bananble free lark. he's like nelson mandela but a pirate as well as a terrorist.

9/9/2009,"f*ck off and learn to use forums...besides that, its not an issue."
9/9/2009,"are you kidding me? the csm was never designed to be the ""ccp internal investigation squad"" (they have a human resources division for that reason) that everyone says they are. the csm is supposed to be the players voice to the devs of ccp. that is all. nothing else. they bring up ideas, suggestions, bug problems and more to the attention of the devs. given the fact that ccp is willing to work with players is saying a lot since many companies ignore their player base completely. --isaac"
9/9/2009,you have an extraordinarily large forehead.
9/9/2009,"i really hope they aren't thinking of centrally hosting a server farm for an fps game.you can play eve with a 500ms ping.you can not play an fps effectively with a ping above 250ms.local servers, hosted by community members, with a system for safe & secure transmission of play data back to eve's servers is a must. as an australian i can tell you i've never successfully played an fps game on a overseas server. they *must* be geo-located."
9/9/2009,"yes, a member of the csm used insider information to try to make money. he got booted from the csm and a 30-day game ban within 12 hours of doing so. the system seems to have worked just fine in this case. so how exactly do you have a fight between, say, bob dusters and goon dusters, when one is 90% euro and the other is 90% us? if they're fighting each other, it has to be on a single server, and if they're not fighting each other, the whole thing is a farce. that said, i agree with you. they're either going to have to make a non-twitch fps(good luck), regionally segregate it(wtf?) or have issues with ping(ugh). that's one of a few structural concerns i have with dust. i'm not going to chicken little it up like people were doing when it was announced, but i do have concerns, and this is one of them. we'll see."

9/9/2009,hell.. he should have been perma-banned... if not that.. should have had his ass sued for breech of nda at that rate.
9/9/2009,"yes. the 0,0 members conspiracy. just look at you and to others csm members. all is 0.0 members like vuk lau, you and others.the csm members just 0.0 puppets who it was made compulsory for their alliance members, that it is possible to vote for just their delegated members only, not for anyone else.when the other playerbase (low sec,high sec) want to change a positive thing in game, this 0.0 it is not allowed and it is voted down.like afk cloaking + mwd cloak, logoffsky, and other dirty,tricky and cheater things. just see it what the first thing what to want to do it.vote for more isk to 0.0 and lot of 0.0 idiotism.csm a 0.0 b*llsh*t nothing else."
9/9/2009,"i have no real interest in 0.0, other than as source of targets, but you are either not very bright, or you are an alt of some one who is not very bright."
9/9/2009,"i'm pleased to state this is something we can both agree on. we both care deeply about the cause of user representation in online spaces, otherwise your participation in this thread would not be so involved.so, drake, in the interests of debate; how do you feel the csm can be redeemed?do you feel that ccp will be more eager or less eager to share future design decisions with the csm in the wake of this betrayal? and if the sharing of this information is withheld, then what purpose could the csm have in the future?we are starting to approach the limitations of a player-run democracy. is there a way forward?i'm very interested in your opinion."
9/9/2009,"goodthe sooner we get people to stfu and stop whining about the csm needing to be disbanded the sooner someone will get the balls to stand up and push for more intelligent representation and less egotistical e-peen waving popularity crap.i may be a troll at times but i only do what i do because i am sick and tired of people posting stupid little whine fests waving ego festered e-peens all over the place all the while having there hoards of even more foolish pilots showing up.i don't hate the individual... i hate the fact they are so dimwitteded and narrow sighted that it makes one scream when it comes to rationality of the situation.no i'm not an expert or a know it all.. and i apologize if i come accross as such... but no one can deny the massive population of people who make assumptions and quick conclusions without thinking things through... 9 times out of 10 i see people posting posts for one single reason... they lost something... or they failed to do something becuase someone did something somewhere.eve online is a game ""ffs""! people are so damn greedy they lose focus of that fact.who the hell has the right to dictate what ccp does or say? yes i'm a paying customer... yes i'd like to know what to expect when i log into the game each and every day... but i couldn't care less about what ccp does beyond that point.dust 514 (or whatever its called) is just an another game... yes it may affect eve online in some form or fashion but what we have are nothing but assumptions... and if there's one thing i've learned... people who make assumptions on assumptions are making themselves out to be an ass ""outa u and me"".i'm sorry but that's the harsh cold reality of it.until ccp fully discloses the details... we literally have no right to dictate or guess or judge something that literally does not exist.there are far more important things to worry about over some stupid opinion over some game that may get canceled or not even affect the grand scheme of the game in the long run.hell i welcome it! the idea of interacting with people on the ground with people in space has my corporation (clan rather) rejoicing... some of us cant really afford to play this game... but they can afford that game. 0.0 is stagnant... its the same ol tune next verse... this disrupts status quo.i refuse to deny such a new thing because it just might make the game even better than before.heck you guys have had it too easy... whats wrong with a little challenge? i'm a small potatoes ceo of this corp... we have to struggle to survive...rome didn't last forever... it fell in time... times change...there is no such thing as a true democracy. someone has someone's pocket lined in some form or fashion... its nothing more than a stupid popularity contest. whose got the largest e-peen and whose got the most isk.that said... the csm will never fully satisfy everyone and it will surely continue to generate people just like you.<cont.>"
9/9/2009,"the csm will continue to have my support as there will always be at least 1 rational thinking individual in that bunch who will see us small time guys and say ""hey... he's got a good idea"".my idea (skill injection) was carried to the top 10 list to be delivered to ccp.even if it gets shot down... my measily little troll voice got carried up to the ears where it needed to be.that means the csm is doing there job.am i assuming they are doing so? no.i have faith they will do there job... because there's not much else to do.the csm may not accomplish a great deal but there job is not to change this game... or change policy... or do the things over half the people demand.the csm's job is to represent the player base and talk to the dev's... whether ccp accepts them or not is ccp's decision... not ours... not csm.i realize its such a contradictory/halfassed way of thinking about it... but until you get there.. the csm will never make sense nor will it work in your eyes.you wanted my opinion? you got it.whether you accept it or reject it is none of my concern."
9/9/2009,"while i'm obviously rather annoyed at this(as anyone who has seen me post here can imagine), my guess is that ccp's craptacular forum software can't differentiate between new threads and new posts for the purposes of time limits, so they just hit both. or, failing that, they figure spammers would just start replying instead of posting, which has the disadvantage of being harder to spot and kill. in any case, new forum software is coming soon, and it'll hopefully be less bad, and capable of doing things to better deal with this nonsense."
9/9/2009,its a good thing
9/9/2009,there's no way

9/9/2009,"i despise everything about the login trap. it is by every definition an exploit. as of now, we are limited to certain ways of collecting intel. local is one, surrounding systems is another. we have no way of identifying which ships are waiting in space. hell, we don't even know if they exist!on the other side of the coin, the pilot who is not logged in uses out-of-game means to receive in-game intel from the battlefield, and make a decision to login (which is quite different from undocking or jumping in system) based upon this intel.this exploit needs to be addressed. whether it be a 5 minute login flag or a login delay, something needs to be done to fix it."
9/9/2009,"well, eve is a persistent universe, after all.. logged off players arent really gone, they've just shut their ships down to be off the neocom network. the time it takes to login is long enough, if they had timed it wrong, you still would have gotten the kill after all. its just ppl sitting in hidden ambush positions waiting for a signal to light your ass up.there, thats all the rp reason you need for the login trap.. sure most of us dont actively rp, but its still part and parcel of eve. if it wasnt, then ccp wouldnt bother with all the chronicals and such."
9/9/2009,since when does privateers accept such whiner?any kind of delay is just stupid. i would have lost multiple ships to fw lag if i had any kind of delay on logging back in.someone has been smarter than you. cope with it.
9/9/2009,"maybe everyone should remain in-game regardless of login status.............sure it means a bunch of people in local who aren't online, but with local removed as it likely will be at some stage, that would no longer be an issue.ships could persist, you leave it in space, it's modules stay active, if you're not careful in where you leave your ship you may lose it.......this would make eve truely persistent on this level.with improved scanning and intel systems besides local this could work well."
9/9/2009,god what a terrible idea.
9/9/2009,"i'll make this easy, you jump into an est camp that has three (yes 3!!!) nyx. they get a long range point on you. you try to slow boat it back to the gate because you thought you didn't need an mwd...but we're getting way off topic, fit one, don't fit one, caldari gun fittings are still balanced."
9/9/2009,"contract based bounty-hunting shouldn't require high security status to get the desired effect though. if i understand the innitial thread-starter correctly, the only reason for changing the system is so that people won't collect their own bounties with alts if they get too high. and i also don't think security status requirements would really change that phenomenon anyway, it's not that uncommon to have a missioning alt with high security status.i wouldn't want bounty hunters to be turned into cops either, but even if it was the only way for bounties to work it'd be better than it is now, as bounty hunting currently isn't nearly going to cover your expenses. few bounties are high enough for that.currently i'd go with the option of making it beneficial in some way to have a bounty on your head, so that you have to make a risk assesment: keep a high bounty for the benefits and live with the added risk of getting shot, anywhere and at any time, or cash the bounty yourself and lose the benefits.if this where implemented, i think some people would even put bounties on their own heads to gain it's benefits, risking to lose their own money if they get shot. it'd be a little bit like taking a bet on your own life."

9/9/2009,"if the last couple csm/ccp iceland minutes are anything to go by, your looking at a +3week wait before the sanitized minutes get posted.i for one expect them to sadly be further delayed because of ccp focusing on getting the finishing touches on fan fest that takes place in less than a month.if we are real lucky, the minutes come out before ff, giving those who are able to attend a basis from which to form smart questions to the ccp qna panels at ff. i suspect this is just wishful thinking on my part."
9/9/2009,i'll see what i can do to speed things up
9/9/2009,"you can read an account of the csm experience here, with everything covered by the nda redacted, while you are waiting.mazzilliu's iceland trip report~edit: or you could if ccp didnt censor url's !smart people can quote the post and g to the linked address manually after trying to navigate to www.xxxxxxxxxx.com thanks to the censors."

9/10/2009,totally for supporting more bonuses for t2 frigs.my hawk is being out dpsed by a tech1 ship in eft with all lvl5 skills and the other one with basic noob skills. *sigh* why even bother getting it except for the range bonus. even that isnt that great.
9/10/2009,assault frigates lacking 4th bonus
9/10/2009,"it's not a matter of people agreeing or disagreeing even, it's part of status quo.all t2 ships get 4 bonuses and assault frigates are t2 ships and should thus get their 4th bonus.originally the assault frigates' 4th bonus was the racial resist, which is now built into the hull like all other t2 ships.however, they have yet to recieve their new 4th bonus.supported all the way as afs not having a 4th bonus is breaking the current t2 ship standards."
9/10/2009,"supported. there is no reason to have one bonus removed from the ""frigate"" bonuses. for example, incursus +10% small hybrid falloff, +5% small hybrid damage per frigate level - becomes enyo +5% small hybrid damage per frigate level. wtf?!"
9/10/2009,supported
9/10/2009,"+1 yeah lets get enough people on here to make ccp give the 4th bonus once and for all. seriously t2 frigs are too fragile to bs neuts + light drones. bs's shouldn't be able to use light drones anyways.i just insta pop each time i fight a bs, cus i get ca"
9/10/2009,"in our little chit chat with ccp on this they told us the reason that ass frigs only have 3 boners is because the damage resistance that is innate to the hull was supposed to be the 4th bonus. yet they did agree that ass frigs should be looked at again, and i personally suggested an afterburner speed bonus anyways i know this isnt a resolution or anything i just want you guys to know it was on the agenda and was duly raised as an issue"
9/10/2009,"maybe this will help: think of kinetic missiles as the caldari weapon system. missiles are really a weapon system all by themselves, the launcher is just a thingy you stick on the ship so they have a place to launch from.so, any time a caracal pilot uses the caldari weapon system (kinetic missiles), a damage bonus applies; any time the pilot uses a non-caldari weapon system (em, thermal or explosive missiles), no damage bonus applies.this is analogous to a rail or laser ship using projectiles -- there's no damage bonus.problem solved."
9/10/2009,"supported. you make perfect, wonderful sense."
9/10/2009,"you'll find missiles under the ammunition section on the market cause erm there ammo not the weapon system.thinking about it in a bizarre way does not change the fact that caldari mb tactics ( damage type swapping ) is not compatible with the damage bonus given per player skill level.i have demonstrated xxx times that against 2/3rds of targets you either damage switch and get no bonus , or stick with kin and do even less damage.players who have trained up caldari cruiser 5 have no way to get extra dps against these targets than a player who has only trained level 2.if you can show me a way that a pilot who has level 5 cal cruiser can get more dps against an ishtar ( example ) than a level 2 cal cruiser pilot while flying a caracal ( example ) i will agree there is no issue."
9/10/2009,i agree- having the bonus only for kinetic also makes it easier for pvpers to predict what type of dmg caldari pilots are more likely to do.
9/10/2009,supported. something must be changed to separate level 5 pilot from the level 2 pilot.

9/10/2009,"again you fail to understand that you have the option to damage swap. a laser or hybrid (to a lesser extent projectile) gunboat cannot. it must keep shooting it's racial/bonused damage type(s) at resists no matter whether they are advantageous or disadvantageous. whereas a laser or hybrid gunboat has to ""stick with"" his bonused damage type(like your kinetic) ""and do even less damage"" than if he could reload with antoher damage type. so you see the missile boat comes out ahead on that count. as to training level 5 in ship getting you no benefit, it is a flawed premise upon which you base the argument. a harbinger pilot with bc 5 is still doing +5% to lasers(mostly em with some thermal) damage per level more to his target, just as a drake pilot is still doing +5% to kinetic missiles damage per level more. the extreme resists of certain select tech ii ships to their backstory enemy's bonused damage type is a different matter. and in that the drake comes out ahead because he is not stuck with his bonused-but-negated-in-this-situation kinetic. at an ishtar all he has to do is use em on shields and then swap to explo on armor to do way more dps (unless the ishtar pilot plugged and overcompensated for either resist hole). in contrast the harbinger pilot is still stuck doing em/therm at a vaga with insane resists to those damage types.regardless, i doubt you will understand the counter arguments that have been presented by many that have replied here. i would simply point out that for the number of pages and replies in this thread you have a paltry 17 supporters. and, the majority of those are undoubtedly pilots who fly only caldari ships and cannot look at the ship bonus situation with much overall perspective. your suggestion is going nowhere. please read up the earlier posts. i for one think some creative things could be done to missiles(which would mainly benefit caldari ships) and i gave one set of examples. your suggestion is not good for the game, it would imbalance it. every race is for the most part stuck with one meh ship bonus (for example 10% less cap use per level to simply make them not cripple your own ship, 5% rof on lol rof arty and falloff afflicted ac projectiles). caldari should be no different. and in fact your meh bonus is the least limiting."
9/10/2009,"op's argument is based on the sophistic principle that balance is determined by the nature and utility of bonuses, rather than comparisons of the performances of ships.try again with a proper argument."
9/10/2009,qftthis post is about bonuses and the pathetic worthlessness of them on cmb's.if i have included other ships in post it is to demonstate the effectiveness of there bonuses as compared to cmb's bonuses.
9/10/2009,you've just agreed that your own thread is stupid and based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how game balance is determined.
9/10/2009,"noi have just agreed that this post is about bonuses and not ship v ship balance.unfortunettely lots of peops dont seem to understand that yet , but they will."
9/10/2009,"this post was bound to be contentious, when i made it i never expected it to be an easy ride.the issue is not immediatelly obvious especially to those who have never flown cmb's.as expected most ""arguments against"" have been of the ship v ship balance nature by people who have not read and understood the op.plus anytime anyone dares to mention anything that might boost caldari there is gonna be resistance.i am more than happy with 17 supports at this point this thread is still relativelly young.your quite correct i think in assuming that only cmb pilots will support this thread.this is due not to them misunderstanding balance but to them understanding the contratictory nature of cmb bonuses versus battle tactics.i have deligentilly read every post.if people want to make suggestions about missiles to make them more like guns they should do so in there own topic.this suggestion would not imbalance the game.if that were true then everyone would be flying the double damage bonused heavy assult spewing sacrilidge.this suggestion would bring more balance to the game.instead of virtually all experianced solo roaming cruisers pilots being ( thorax | vexor | rupture ) we might be able to include caracal in that list too.( yes i know there are some solo cara's out there , but these are flown by newish pilots who have not had chance to cross train to something decent yet ).your argument about other bonuses is off topic and irrevelant cmb have ""other"" non damage bonuses too.this post is about damage bonuses on cmb's and there woeful* nature.*by woeful i mean a damage bonus that averages out to no more than 1.6% per level over all encounters when ship is flown by a competent pilot who knows which missiles to fire."
9/10/2009,"like i said before, you will not understand the bonus in relation to the overall backstory and the bonuses(and concurrent limitations) other ships receive. you ignore my harbinger-drake example. you are fixated on the fact that your kinetic bonus will not always do wonders for you. everyone faces similar bonus/limitation situations.the only thing i will respond to about your last post is you pointing to the sacrilege for a this-is-not-fair argument. the cerberus, like the sacrilege gets a double damage bonus, rof and kinetic damage. the sac get rof and damage(for heavy assault, i.e. short-range missiles only). so, both hacs get a situational damage bonus in addition to their universally applicable rof bonus. i do not see them out of balance, they do different things. were the sac's damage bonus to apply to heavy assault and heavy missiles you would have something to complain about.really, look at the bonus in relation to other racial ship bonuses. try flying all the races. i do. if there is any race that at this time has a right to demand alterations it is minmatar and projectiles. well, aside from all racial recons but caldari, where the ecm boats can't even suffer a nerf like the damp, web, and nos, boats suffered without getting a simultaneous buff. do i agree that each recon needed some change? yes. do i think ccp did the right thing in each situation? no. but this is a different subject.the kinetic bonus is fine, and as i said the least restrictive. someone mentioned giving all missiles a kinetic component to damage. not sure what i think of that, but it a hell of a lot better suggestion than that in your op."

9/10/2009,"the problem with this ""proof"" is that the sacrilege is still very limited by its range. you're advocating a pick-your-own-damage type out to the 100km plus ranges of a caracal.if you want to look at this as a bonus-only problem and not draw balance into the equation, then you'll need to change it to something that is not a damage bonus -- but since you've kept it as a damage bonus which changes the way the caldari ships stack up against others it is intrinsically a balance issue.damage-type swapping is, as you've said, a valid tactic; but so is putting small weapons on a vexor (no bonus), putting lasers on a vengeance (no bonus), and any number of other commonly made choices that would seem to negate any bonus you get from increasing your racial ship skill.again, i am looking at this suggestion as a caldari pilot; i fly a lot of missile boats. i'd love for the bonus to always apply, and would support something like what was suggested earlier to change the bonus to apply to explosion velocity or explosion radius. but then i'd be sad that my damage output had gone down. on the caracal i'd even take a bonus to targeting range, as you can't fire out to your maximum range without sensor boosters.but, i'm happy with the bonuses the way they are now."
9/10/2009,"sure the sac is short range i concur.is it overpowered compared to other short range ships ?.i cant point to a cruiser hull that does 100km missile damage with non-racial bonus as an example , because i'm pretty sure there isnt one in game.i can however point to the raven a bs hull.a cruise raven can hit out to 100km with ease.a cruise raven has a r.o.f. bonus of 5% per level.is a cruise raven overpowered when compared to other battleships ?please ask yourself the above questions.do you still believe that a r.o.f. or damage bonus on other cmb's would make them overpowered.personally i can only say that i rarely get to fight a sac , and have never fought against a cruise raven that i can recall, this leads me to the conclusions that the eve population in general does not consider r.o.f. or dps damaged modded missile boats to be o.p."
9/10/2009,"caldari are currently the worst pvp ships in the game, because most ships have no ken hole, plus missiles are currently in a fail state. rockets need to be fixed. what else is new? fix caldari bonuses, boost missiles. it would be about time."
9/10/2009,i talked about racial damage types in reply [60]sure gallente/amarr are stuck with 2 damage types from there turrets.no way on gods green earth can you argue that mini are stuck with 1 racial damage type.gallente/amarr gun boat tactics do not include damage type selection.when an amarr pilot fighting with lasers or a gallente pilot fighting with hybrids enters combat the choice of ammo depends upon the range which the gallente/amarr pilots wishes to fight.hence gallente/amarr tactics are based on range/tracking/optimal and falloff paramaters.the bonus to damaged bonused gallente/amarr gun boats is either a r.o.f. bonus or a dps bonus.these bonuses work at all ranges/tracking/optimal and falloff configurations of a fight no matter which type of ammo you choose to fire.therefore it is true to say that the hull damage bonuses are compatible with the combat tactics that a gallente/amarr combat pilot is expected to employ.if 2 pilots of equal competency are compareda level 5 pilot in a gallente gun boat firing optimal ammo out of hybrids will allways do 15% more dps than a level 2 pilot all other things being equal.now compare to caldari cmb's.caldari cmb tactics are based on damage type selection not on range.a caldari mb pilot does not have the option of selecting a more damaging ammo based on range / just as a gallente/amarr pilot does not have the option of selecting a more damaging ammo based on resists.if a cmb pilot changes ammo the hull bonus does not apply. hence this post.caldari missile boats bonuses are not compatible with caldari missile boat tactics.if 2 pilots of equal competency are compareda level 5 pilot in a cmb boat firing optimal ammo out of missile launchers will do 15% more dps only in 1/3 engagements when compared to a level 2 pilot.
9/10/2009,"looking at the worst case scenario for both shipsa level 5 harbinger pilot will do 15% more dps against a t2 mini ship than a level 2 harbinger pilot when both pilots are fitting there bonused weapon systems.this i calculate from 10% more therm/em for the level 2 pilot.and 25% more therm/em for the level 5 pilot.remember lasers have ammo which increases damage based on max range of the ammo. ( range based tactics ).a level 5 drake pilot will do 0% more dps against a t2 gallente ship than a level 2 drake pilot when both pilots are fitting there bonused weapon systems.this i calculate from 0% more em/exp for the level 2 pilot.and 0% more em/exp for the level 5 pilot.remember missile do not have a range based damage increase based on max range of the ammo.they have equal damage to one another but in 1 of 4 flavours ( damage type selection tactics ).i am only interested in discussing damage bonuses in this post.gallente damage bonuses are allways beneficial during combat when gallente pilots fit gallente weapons to gallente boats.amarr damage bonuses are allways beneficial during combat when amarr pilots fit amarr weapons to amarr boats.minmatar damage bonuses are allways beneficial during combat when minmatar pilots fit minmatar weapons to minmatar boats.i agree with all of the above , i acknowledge its as things should be.i wish i could say the same thing about caldari , but that would be a lie.why should i consent to second rate bonuses for caldari ? or cover my eyes and pretend that the playing field is flat.a bonus to a single type of ammo is not equal to a bonus to a weapons system."

9/10/2009,"i don't get this. how can they not understand how horribly this gimps even the most basic functioning of the pvp in their game?what can we do, seriously?i enter a system and see a few ships on a 360 scan, now to pinpoint them i need to click for 90 degree scan, then 60, then 30, then 5 degrees several times for different planets, belts, gates, stations, to see if there's a pos at the planet or not, etc., and heaven forbid they are in a mission and i need to pinpoint their location in empty space with numerous clicks.......add the 2 second delay to this equation and the chance of actually catching someone shrinks at an alarming speed. and in the most torturous fashion i can even dream of. each time there's that beeep and the message telling me to wait 2 seconds, i get a tiny ulcer from knowing that the target now has another 2 seconds to realise he's being hunted and gtfo. 2 seconds - a long time in a game where a fraction of a second can make all the difference.i'll spend a lot of time most days thinking about fittings and strategies, i come home and do some basic testing on eft, looking forward to seeing if the ideas work out...but then i log on to test the new setup for real. beep. beep. beep. a few minutes of this, and i've had it. so i dock up and log off. no fun. and, more and more often now, i just play something else instead, rather than logging on to disappointment yet again.and worst of all is knowing that - however significantly this change improves the lag situation - the game was working before. it's not like everything was lagged to hell and nobody could do a thing until the 2 second delay was introduced. because now, even though there might be less lag somewhere (i haven't noticed it myself but i'm sure theyre not just plain lying) the game does not work at all. now it's broken. at least for those of us who like fast paced hunting-style pvp - the core of eve's gameplay.it's like playing call of duty 4 with a 1 dpi mouse. try getting some headshots with that. that's how pvp is in eve at the moment.1500+ replies and the only response from ccp is a second hand reply through a csm telling us to just forget it. what the hell is that?ccp, please?"

9/10/2009,"0.1 seconds and no more.the reason it's used so much is because you used to be able to check stuff constantly.it's also a nerf to interceptors and covert ops ships (and solo pvp) checking out the system mid-warp.in addition, it's annoying as hell when reducing the angle to constantly get that message.so out of the blue, rather than trying to discuss or introducing a tiny delay like 0.1 seconds, you kill off the functionality of one of the primary pvp tools in the whole of eve without any discussion?spam clicking it was the way you could remain aware of your surroundings and check up on ships in warp.inties and covops ships had a role in this as a cloaked covert ops ship or an inty in warp could quickly roam & scan around the system.everybody always brings a directional scanner but not everyone brings a (skilled) prober, but now we're being forced to use probes if we quickly want to check out a system for targets?i'd rather live with the lag and keep the directional scanner as it was.not mad, just confused and somewhat dissapointed that such a huge change to the dynamics of pvp happens without any warning or discussion, as it would've instantly been revealed to you that 2 seconds is way too long a delay.spamclicking was the primary function of the directional scanner, not a problem that needed fixing.the fact that was it being used so much that it was causing a load on the server should've already told you that it's not something you should remove so easily.what's next? 10 second delay in fetching market orders for tritanium?"

9/10/2009,"shouldn't some ships who are designed for speed be able to get away from a huginn by design? otherwise the tactic of slowing ships down would work against every single ship-type, which doesn't promote varied gameplay.this does however mean that alternative tactics should be available to take down really fast ships. currently the only alternate tactic i can think of is to have a really fast ship of your own, and that might not make too much sense. alternatively you could say that webs are designed especially to be used against the really fast ships, and therefor should be largely uneffective gainst other ships.i mostly support the proposed change, exept that i wouldn't want the huginn to be effective against every shiptype. otherwise you end up with huginns everywhere."
9/10/2009,i support this thread but not at it's current value. i feel a 90% web bonus for recon 5 is in order.the web strength for both minmatar recons and the hyena is way out of line. it should be 90% for recon 5. if you choose to keep it the way it is then every other recon also needs there bonus reduced to come in line with the current iteration on the minmatar recons. why this wasn't correctly when the web nerf was instituted is beyond me. it makes absolutely no sence and makes the minmatar recons utterly useless for it's intended purpose.

9/10/2009,"on my opinion, the problem is pretty easy to solve, actualy.insurance contract length, places where you do fly, etc etc aren't that meaningful.though, just consider this:- wreck x ships in a given amount of time, and you'll see your insurance fees increase. wreck none or few, and expect fees cut.you tend to play too much with the insurances stuff ? you give your insurer a call every two days ? no clue he will end telling you he will insure you no more...for a while.so the maths here are easy to compute:- much ships broken= more insurance fees- few ships broken= less insurance fees- way too much ships broken: no more insurance.what do you think about that ?"
9/10/2009,this old old bug / exploit has been abused by many player over the years and frankly is kinda of redundant.the whole emergency warp feature is also an out dated feature that is more than redundant.my suggestions is simple.hard code the coordinates of the log off location and until the player reaches that location via the re-entry warp (which should also still be in effect even if the player logs off again) should only warp into that location.loosing kills to poor judgement is one thing but seriously this is the oldest of the old sort it out.
9/10/2009,was raised by csm a few days ago i beleive
9/10/2009,"the first time i heard about this mechanic, it was from a guy talking about how he killed the guy anyways. any idiot with a scan probe launcher can find the person trivially, since you know he's within a million or two km of where you saw him last. this doesn't seem like a problem to me - it's a tactic more interesting than it is powerful. i like it, personally."
9/10/2009,i hate having this happen.
9/10/2009,"just make logging in space unsafe.noone should be able to log undocked and disappear, no ship should disappear magically. if one logged unsafe in space the ship should never disappear but stay there (scannable) 1 mio. away from the spot he logged.further, no emergency warp or disappear while scrambled within 15 minutes or some longer time...i.."
9/10/2009,"that proposal is just stupid for all systems without stations (0.0, w-space)you would be mostlikely ganked every money and back in your med clone station.before your propose something else think it through."
9/10/2009,"this seems like a problem i currently know and lots of people know and use. ""the log on trap"" dun dun dunn. sure not the same thing but it made me think about it.just some guy uses the log off log on method to gain an advantage to the game either by using it for escape in warping or by the log on traop... for me thats an exploit."
9/10/2009,i have a feeling you dont like it because its not stupid but because either your using that method yourself a lot or because you know you'll become very vulnerable yourself. maybe people should try to use another tactic beside the log off/log on
9/10/2009,"well, ok, make logging in a pos ff safe besides logging docked. nothing else.that should be enough. if you fly to a hostile region, you have to come back for logging or you will die..."
9/10/2009,lets assume i am roaming in 0.0. it is getting late and i cant get home. so i log out but my ship stays in space and i get killed by a prober passing through a few hours after i logged?how is that useful?
9/10/2009,"i gotta agree with ""no way"" on that. we're not all station huggers, some of us roam deep space many, many jumps from a friendly place to dock. for some of us logging out in space is a normal way to end the day. it has nothing to do with hostiles or agression, it's just like pulling into a dock."
9/10/2009,why does it have to warp you away? couldn't it just log you out/in where you are currently located without warping you?
9/10/2009,"until you realize that if they do the logon-logoff quick enough (like using 2 computers / clients) they are invulnerable when you land right next to them, and you cant put a point on them.had it once with an obelisk, the guy kept logging off and on, we probed his e-warp spots like 15 times and had a whole fleet sitting right next to it, but nobody was able to lock it."
9/10/2009,"i can respect the frustration of having this tactic used against you, however i think that this aspect of the log-off mechanic is currently balanced. the reason that it works the way it does is because more often than not, people logging off in dangerous space happens by accident- their client crashes, or something goes wrong in their network. and believe me- problems like that occur a lot more frequently than the people who abuse this mechanic.i don't support the idea that you should stay in the same spot you originally e-warped to on log-off, however i do strongly support that the 15 minute aggression timer should be reset if you are aggressed and logged out."
9/10/2009,"because if you lose connection in the middle of a fight, you'd generally prefer that the game at least try to get you out of danger."
9/10/2009,"this... big time.the one thing that keeps me from supporting any sort of ""logging"" proposal is my expeince as an information technologist....the science of internet dictates that you can never ever know the real reason for someone ""logging off"" in the middle of anything.you naturally assume they did it... but how do you know it wasn't joe schmoe driving his damned backhoe over the ####ing backbone fibre optic trunk in some obscene random location knocking out internet for the region (true story >.<;;; )?you don't... and yet you say ""well its there problem""ccp however ignores you... regardless of your wardrum bangin.like it or not... this issue is not likely going to resolve in anyone's favor."
9/10/2009,"do it already! not even asking for modal windows and stuff. i just want a possibility to set where my ship/centerpoint is displayed, move it to the right or left. now my ship is split in half when going dual screen...."
9/10/2009,yes please.
9/10/2009,like it and want it
9/10/2009,"currently, many players spam their directional scanner in low/nullsec to look for the probes that could be scanning them out. while strongly i agree that low/nullsec needs a buff, i don't think that giving low security and no-security systems the extra security of scanning out probes is the answer. probing is meant to be a covert activity, and used as a tool to surprise someone. remove probes from the directional scanner- we can work on buffing low/nullsec in other ways."
9/10/2009,that's seriously not funny.please tell me your on space crack.
9/10/2009,you needed to ask?
9/10/2009,well the last few posts he's done... or proposals for that matter have been refreshing... that is until today.
9/10/2009,"consider my arguments, and give me a legitimate counter-argument before accusing me of drug abuse!but seriously- checking the d-scanner for probes is something done primarily in low-null security. to the guy who is paying attention, it buffs that space by making him virtually invincible. i don't think that adding security to low/null sec is the way to buff it- that just defeats the point of the systems in the first place.i'm interested to hear you counter-arguments."
9/10/2009,the game needs t2 shuttles asap.
9/10/2009,awesome. well formed idea!
9/10/2009,"as long as they can fit a covert ops cloak, and warp at 15 au/sec, with a subwarp speed of over 9000, and carry 5,000 m3 of cargo, i'm down.and then i woke up.why? what possible purpose could they serve that a t1 shuttle can't?"
9/10/2009,"epeen booster, duh."
9/10/2009,"i've been referring to speed ceptors at ""t2 shuttles"" for years now. they're like regular shuttles that go 20% faster, fit mwds, warp 2.25x as fast, hold 8x the cargo, have a fair bit more hp, and can even pvp in a pinch. skill requirements are a bit high for shuttles, but it's still not too hard. if you can come up with a ship better at the t2 shuttle role than that, i'm all ears."
9/10/2009,"right, so you're trolling. thanks for the confirmation.and here i've been using my firetail for that. ceptors you say?"
9/10/2009,"on a thread demanding t2 shuttles asap, you bet."
9/10/2009,agreed
9/10/2009,"lol. ok, you win. you made me laugh when i was having a craptastic day. troll away, you are officially my hero.at least until i get home and have some baileys."
9/10/2009,"i'm a gallente pilot, and the comet really doesn't compare to the ares in this role. firetails make a fine substitute for the duct-tape crowd, though. anything that autopilots from point a to point b faster than a t1 shuttle is fine, really."
9/10/2009,"yep, i would buy one."
9/10/2009,i would definetely buy one of these. sounds like a great idea. i'm surprised ccp has not implemented this yet.
9/10/2009,ok i have just been informed that ccp once again is getting weird ideas in there heads about how the game is played....read this:linkageso basically they are going to nerf the titan so that it can only be fired at a single ship - i mean come on nerfing the titan???they should be in fact upping the power of the dd device no nerfing it!if you support me on this and dont want ccp to nerf the titan then vote yes for this petition...
9/10/2009,"hey... chicken little... yeah you... mr. sky is falling.linking to an outside ""source"" is called rumor mongering.not supported until i see something from a local source."
9/10/2009,"i'm not quite sure i'd support this either. most of all because i don't know the design philosophy behind it. but i can guess that they want to get rid of the liniair 'bigger is better' dynamics. especially since resources are becoming less and less of an issue in the game. i wouldn't want to see titans popping up everywhere. making them more powerfull will increase the likeliness that i will end up seeing them everywhere. on the flip-side, i do want to have to be afraid of them, and i'm unsure if i would be when the doomsday device gets nerfed. either way i'd want to know more before i back you up on this one."
9/10/2009,titans are the worst ship ever introduced into eve
9/10/2009,"lol, nerf them to hell.ok, seriously, what's been hinted at seems pretty good to me. otherwise the game will eventually become titans online, because as it is now get enough of them together and it is."
9/10/2009,"ok i see your points are valid but the point of a titan is its meant to be big and epic and not many ppl can fly them because they are expensive etc so making them weaker isnt gd , i know why goons will like it cause nobody will be able to wipe out there swarms of rifters anymore in a single fell swoop lols"
9/10/2009,i hope this is a troll...
9/10/2009,dds do not a fun game make. i'm quite glad they are being rebalanced. titans are way too much iwin and not enough ilose. shut up and wait for the devblog before whining.--isaac
9/10/2009,well think about it this way they only kill glass cannons and not much else if u have descent resists so really its you who wins against titans and its alot of potential ilose for the titan pilot actually
9/10/2009,"problem is, the more time passes, the more people will be able to fly them. as i said before, resources aren't much of a problem anymore, and skills are a matter of time. if you want to make them strong but exclusive you'd need to somehow limit the number of titans that can exist in the game at any one time, which i'd prefer over making them weaker, but i reckon ccp would have thought of this, and their reasons for choosing to make them weaker are probably more complicated than 'there are going to be too many of them'."
9/10/2009,"titans need a boost to their defensive abilities, not their offensive. this is about the right level of offensive power...if they can survive on the battlefield. replace their laughable gun dps bonus with a 15%/level resist bonus(or more), and you might get somewhere. they'd still need to travel inside a carrier blob, but at least they'd have a chance of living in real combat if they did."
9/10/2009,did you ever consider that you shouldnt be able to fit the biggest of everything on every ship? often downgrading to the smaller turrets doesnt really harm you and frees up resources for other modules.fitting always be a matter of compromises.
9/10/2009,"i hear the scorpion excels in wh space against sleepers. in pvp situations not so much because it's primary target so often what i would like to see changed is the coveter. not the ship itself but the skill requirements. i believe the skill requirements for the coveter need to be lowered a little. the difference between flying a coveter and flying a hulk is 36 hours of skill training or less. alternatively, the difference between a retriever and a covetor is a level five 4x skill and a level five 3x skill.there's really no point in even going for a coveter due to the skill requirements so similar to a hulk.i propose the following nerf to covetor skill requirements:mining barge ivastrogeology iv"
9/10/2009,"and so on...this tbh, although the vigilant is a gank cruiser and setup as such works fine (see this -link-) gila needs a more solid tank and more pg / cpu.but i do agree with all this post and the op. the eos needs its drone bandwidth back, or the drone bay bonuses moved to drone damage like a domi. they are fairly pointless otherwise.edit was the link, i forgot to add it >.<"
9/10/2009,"not on an omen.it only has the pg to fit 5 medium pulses and an mwd (and no pg for a cap booster or a plate), but simply lacks the cpu for much of anything else.with a proper pg and cpu boost (enough to fit an 800mm plate with guns, mwd and dcu ii) it becomes a more viable ship.as a tech i cruiser, it shouldn't require a lot of skill to be fitted properly.vigilant needs to be able to do more damage in order to be a viable choice over a thorax.isk wise a thorax is always better as you can lose 4-5 of those for every vigilant if not more.and the times that your tank is tested to the point where it would die if it was a thorax but not a vigilant are very rare.generally you'll either get blobbed (in which case it won't matter what ship you're in, better cheap thorax then) or you'll win with some tank to spare.also keep in mind a faction ship (a rare one at that) attracts a lot of attention, negating any additional tank a vigilant might have over a thorax.with more damage however, it can kill targets faster and get out sooner, making it a more viable option.additionaly it might be nice to give it 25m3 more dronebay space (not bandwidth) so it can carry 5 meds and 5 lights, giving it more versatility in what it wants to do. (ecm drones or damage drones)"
9/10/2009,"i want a hotkey to drop drones... we have one to attack, to return and to scoop.we can assign drones to groups, so why not a drone group deploy hotkey?other than that drone ui is fine by me."
9/10/2009,the issue is the lag and drop down window. i agree with the above poster hot keys for all drone actions would be a better work around. something needs to be done for us drone users and making it easier to use them. loading them on the hud would make it fun to load them like a gun and launch them.
9/10/2009,"i wouldn't say no to the ability to assign hot keys to my drone groups so i can launch them. but i have never found myself saying ""omfg why the hell can't i do this?!?!""(and before the obligatory ""you don't use drones"", yes, yes i do. not to the extent of a gallente pilot, but you'd be silly not to use them on a typhoon - i mean they give you all that lovely space for them.)"
9/10/2009,1. never said you didnt uses drones. i would be lead to believe it is not your primary choice when using weapons by your response.2. adding features that allow drone boats to utilize thier hud instead of drop down menu would make drone use easier and more fun.
9/10/2009,"please don't misunderstand. that comment wasn't directed at you per se, but at the hordes of screaming flametrolls that will, eventually, descend on this thread using it as an argument.side note. my cynacism is showing today. it's been one of those days.this would be an accurate statement. drones for me are like decoys that happen to shoot back. they provide a distraction to the enemy so i can shoot them while they shoot my drones.that said, i'm not sure a hud addition is the way to go, unless it replaces the drop down box in some fashion (so i can move it away from my guns and stuff if i want to). i don't need additional circular objects cluttering up my gun display.hot keys i have no opposition to. i would probably actually learn them, if they included the one to launch a specific group of drones.for instance, if you can map a hot key combination alt+d+x where x is a number from 1 - 0. so i can can create a group called defense map it to alt+d+1 and another called reppers and map them to alt+d+2. then when i hit alt+d+1, it launches the defense group. if i hit the recall hot key or alt+d+2, it recalls the first group, and in the second example, autolaunches the second group once the first ones are stored."
9/10/2009,"/me stands on soapbox for ui moddabilityahem. while i like the sentiment, this is too narrow a solution to too broad a problem. i don't think it'd be the right fix, so i can't support it. decent idea, just not the right one."
9/10/2009,"despite the fact there are currently useful methods to split up large stacks in game, they can be quite time-consuming, or repetitive, this proposal is to offer another means that would complement the current methodology.the idea is to split a large stack with one simple request, into 2 or more stacks of approximately the same size per stack (depending on the size of the original stack, and the selected size of the new stacks).there would be two methods that a player can use, a ""basic"" and ""extended/advanced"" method. these additions would complement the existing methods that we all use today. i have summarized the discussion that has occurred thus far, and integrated most of the ideas into a single proposal.basic method:this method does not require a major change to the existing split stack window, but contains 2 minor additions.the addition of a ""split into multiple stacks"" check-boxthe addition of a ""show more options"" drop down arrow, similar to the one on the contracts window. this would bring up the ""advanced"" features of the split window, and would also default to the state the player last put it in.a player would then use the following steps to split a stack:select the stack that is to be divided into many smaller stacks.while holding down the shift-key, drag and drop the stack so the split window appears.at this point, enter the quantity that the stacks will contain, after the split has completed.before hitting ok, ensure a ""check-box"" option called ""split into multiple stacks"" is selected.hit ok.advanced method:this method contains an additional ""numerical"" component that the splitting mechanism would have to take into account. on top of the 2 additions made to the basic method, the advance window provides the following:the addition of a numerical entry box, for the ""total number of stacks"".the ""show more options"" is replaced with ""show less options"".a player would then use the following steps to split a stack:select the stack that is to be divided into many smaller stacks.while holding down the shift-key, drag and drop the stack so the split window appears.at this point, enter the quantity that the stacks will contain, after the split has completed.if the advanced options was not already expanded, the player would click the ""show more options"" arrow.ensure a ""check box"" option called ""split into multiple stacks"" is selected.a numerical amount would be entered into the ""number of stacks"" entry box.hit ok.some examples are:example 1:the player has a stack of 48 blocks he/she wants to split into 16 stacks of 3. they would simply bring up the split window, enter ""3"" into the quantity entry box, and ensure the ""split into multiple stacks"" options is checked. then they would hit ok. they would then get 16 stacks of 3 blocks in their hanger.example 2:the player has a stack of 50 blocks he/she wants to split into 16 stacks of 3, plus a single stack containing the remainder. they would simply bring up the split window, enter ""3"" into the quantity entry box, and ensure the ""split into multiple stacks"" options is checked. then they would hit ok. the would get 16 stacks of 3 blocks, plus 1 stacks of 2 blocks in their hanger.example 3:the player has a stack of 1,100,345,546 units of tritanium, and wants to created 10 stacks of 100,000,000. they would simply bring up the split window, enter ""100,000,000"" into the quantity entry box, ensure the ""split into multiple stacks"" option is enabled, expand out the advanced options (if not already done so, and enter 10 into the number of stacks entry box. the would get 10 stacks of 100,000,000, plus one stack of 100,346,546 units."
9/10/2009,uh... not an issue?i've never had any trouble with stack splits.i just hold shift and drag... put the number in... rinse..repeat.
9/10/2009,"aye, tis the rinse repeat part that can be tiresome on larger stacks. and i never really stated it was an issue, was more looking at it as an enhancement of the ui interface."
9/10/2009,"while i disagree with the motivation behind this idea, i agree this could be a useful feature.as for the feature itself, this could be implemented easily enough with an advanced button that opens the window up a bit more, like when you want to place a sell order. it opens it up to be able to specify how many stacks you want at the quantity specified. the computer would then attempt to split into that many stacks of that amount. any left over would be in another stack, or if you can't make that many stacks, like for example trying to split a stack of 50 into three stacks of 20, only two stacks of 20 would come out and 10 left over in the original amount.for the above, it's really just a heh, that'd be cool, rather than a real need.as to the ops need of putting ice into gsc cans, the current mechanic works pretty good. just drag the stack of 50 to the gsc can. you'll get a warning saying the whole stack won't fit and asking you how much you want to put in there, but the max amount (3) is already in the box and you just hit ok.so don't split the stacks first, just drag the stacks into gscs and hit ok to the warnings.edit for emphasis."
9/10/2009,"aye, a slight alteration of the basic idea, possibly more refined.aye, i know this mechanic quite well, and the ideas was to provide the player a means of optimizing that process. by providing a quick method of splitting a stack, all the player has to do is drag/drop the stacks, and not have to worry about another pop up each time he/she does so."
9/10/2009,"a sound idea.i would prefer 2 inputs rather than a checkbox.input 1) how many per stackinput 2) how many stacksif you have a very large stack of stuff , you may not want to unstack it all."
9/10/2009,"good call. keep the ideas/suggestions/comments coming, i'll re-adjust the proposal after some more discussion, and refine it with all the ideas presented."
9/10/2009,"while i don't have any strong arguments for it, i don't have any really convincing ones against it either. i'm not opposed to having it labelled a nice to have."
9/10/2009,"this is probably the best version, i think. just make sure that the second box is the number of stacks, and it defaults to 1, so that anyone who wants to use it like the status quo can. but yeah, sounds like it'd be handy. supported."
9/10/2009,"there are many ships in eve, too many even for an experienced player to remember. however, some ships are similar to each other: there are classes of ships, like destroyers, interdictors and such. it's easy to remember classes, as it's only a few of them (compared to the number of ships).having a ship class column in overview would help many players distinguish a titan from an electronic attack frigate before it's too late. this would bring the learning curve down considerably."
9/10/2009,kicking you guys out of 0.0 to lose motherships in low-sec to tri of all people is something i will tell my grandchildren about.i'll support it just because i feel so bad for you guys.
9/10/2009,"after a couple revisions, you've got a very solid post, yaay. think that's the first time i've ever admitted that. :pi do hope that anyone who knowingly implements or participates in the implementation of a known exploit receives the ban hammer -- regardless of their history or affiliation. actually, it was pretty funny. tri failed hard. after a semi-success ddos attempt, i switched computers and logged in at half armor after drifting outside the pos. i turned around, dropped a booster, overloaded the bottom rack and waited. i entered the shields at 6% structure and everything was burned up.afterwards, the fc emo raged on ts and proceeded to setup a fail pos bowl. then came back another more successful bowl. once out of shields, that was all she wrote. 15% armor and 6% structure later, i saw the pilot's pod for the first time in 2+ years. sad to think you can get under someone's skin so much they'd risk getting banned for using known and clearly denounced exploits."
9/10/2009,tri does not dos attack.
9/10/2009,"yaay was why insurgency failed.he thinks talking fast and saying alot of words makes him a good fc.i remember a time him doing his infamous warp in warp out, be aligned tactic, and whittled his own fleet down from 30 bs to like 3, and was still telling them warp in warp out with over 60 hostile bs on field.you should be publicly executed in a station when ambulation goes live and your biomass displayed on the bar."
9/10/2009,"according to the battlereport posted on shc, they got the pos password from a local member who mailed it to a fleet member, then they proceeded to warp into the tower at the nyx's position (with the password) so they entered the shield, and bumped the nyx out."
9/10/2009,please read this;
9/10/2009,"as much as this looks like a massive failthread, i sort of have to agree with the op's broader point. pos bowling was declared an exploit years ago, but without game-mechanic changes, that needs to be enforced pretty savagely in order to actually be a meaningful rule. i'm in favour of rules enforcement."
9/10/2009,agreed with hersch... op's rep is less than stellar at best... but the point is valid none the less.supported.
9/10/2009,"you're welcome to focus on my belief that i was d/dos'd instead of the facts. it just illustrates what you don't want the attention to be placed on -- the manipulation of a well known and documented exploit.as i said on shc, i accept that i could be wrong about the d/dos, though the connection issues and timing were suspicious. i like how the spin you and your chronies have been using is that i made ""bad decisions that day."" pretty hard to make a bad decision when you're sitting inside your personal pos at 0km from the tower, no?"
9/10/2009,"the irony of this post is, i mentioned no alliance names, no specific incidents, i kept it on the broad view specifically for that reason. i want rule enforcement, because to date, there has been none. tri outted themselves on that incident.anyone who know's skrypt, know's he's done some very crazy things in that mom and should have lost it quit a few times. i won't defend his loss because there are factors that were legit that played into it dieing that could have been avoided.what i do not want to deal with is pos bowling in any form. short of a pos pw change by the tower operators, the only bouncing mechanic that should be legal is manual normal speed bumping. anyone who know's me know's my number one rule is fair play. i don't mind ass hattery, i don't mind meta gaming, so long as it's within the boundaries of fair play. when people go outside those boundaries, i don't tolerate it.the insurgency guy, laugh."
9/10/2009,"since someone else already posted the mechanic... one of the 3 forms of bumping currently possible is as follows.set a warp point in or behind the shields. warp in at the appropriate range. during warp, change the pos pw again on your ship. this creates an immediate ejection from the tower of the ships warping in at the high speed velocities you'd expect if the tower owner had changed the pw.there is a mechanic the devs added to game to prevent this from happening. it is why you cannot change the pos pw once you are inside the shields. if you read the exploit rules, the most apparent part is that you cannot use unintended mechanics that prevent the victim from any sort of response to said action.if tri had warped into the tower, and manually bumped out the player, or had the tower pw changed, there would be no arguement for the bowling."
9/10/2009,"the title mostly says it all, i'm proposing that the entire production pipeline of eve online becomes transparent, so that we can see exactly what features are coming, how they are prioritised, how they are discarded or moved up or down the production pipeline, etc. etc. this will have several effects.1: it'll decrease the feature suggestions a lot because i suspect a lot of features that are being suggested are allready in the pipeline anyway.2: it'll make more clear to the playerbase what direction eve is going in on the long run, and players will be better able to anticipate on those changes and plan ahead.3: it'll make more clear how and why plans change or get canned, and what the overal design philosophy is.ccp has always made it a big issue to be as transparent as possible, and i think i'm not the only one who really likes this about them. it's not only very educational, it also creates a very 'human' bond between the players and ccp as a company. i can understand that marketing-wise, opening up the production pipeline completely, appears like a big can of worms but i really think that the community can handle it well. ccp has been quite forthcoming with upcoming expansions so far, and i think it could be taken to the next level.i'm sure there are cons i'm overlooking, but by all means, tell me about them.note that i'm not saying that making the production pipeline transparent means players should have more influence over it, just that they can see what's going on."
9/10/2009,"nope. ccp, blizzard, valve and many other companies have 0 obligation to do this. its called a ""you do not get to talk about this feature until we decide you get to"" paper. (sorry, forgot the name.) want this changed? good freaking luck. its how businesses have always been run. **edit** btw, how much more transparency do you want? ccp is incredibly open with what they are releasing and look to the player base for comments, suggestions and more. but this is still not enough?! geez...--isaac"
9/10/2009,4 wordswhenpigsfrakkingflygot it? good.why do you think they call it capitalism?please... go take your pipe dream somewhere else.
9/10/2009,"so.... regardless of how unlikely it might be, would you like to see it happen?"
9/10/2009,"maybe, but i'm not wishing for it. i'd rather that ccp focus on releasing quality products than worrying about those that are buying it. --isaac"
9/10/2009,the real question you need to ask is why we don't give a rip in the first place.in truth... i don't.i'm content with what i have/getting.ccp is doing fine... its the yahoo's who go emo over the hint or suggestion of some sort of change without much thought or thinking who have the problem.granted there may be some glitches or bugs... but so far i've not had any earthshattering omgwtf problems in the game. my experience has been mostly positive since i started playing eve... as far as customer satisfaction.granted i'm not saying 100%but i'm not going wacko/ape#### either.
9/10/2009,"i'm not saying ccp are doing things wrong, far from it. i'm just interested and would like to see more of how and why they do things. to learn from. making the production pipeline transparent isn't so we, the players, could correct anything. it's just intended to give additional insight.you may not give a rip about it because your interests aren't the same as mine, and why would they be? though would you lose anything if they did make the production pipeline transparent?"
9/10/2009,"me? this has nothing to do with me.i'm just a paying subscriber.this has everything to do with ccp.people tend to forget that ccp is in charge and ""at large"" when comes to eve.they choose to disclose or to not disclose... they choose to listen or to not listen.the only power you have is whether you pay them or not.your so called ""freedom"" ends right there.when you take that prespective... you'll suddenly realize that demanding anything to do with eve online that is not rationally within reason is pointless.the csm for example... people keep screaming disband because they are useless... they are shortsighted and refuse to accept the fact that ccp chose to pick a select few people to listen too on top of the thousands of players in this game.they did'nt say the csm would have any power to do affect changes... they just get a front row seat to chat... but it stops there.people can't be content with that... they want ""moar"" so they can complain/whine/gripe about any number of things.those who report bugs and exploits are never satisfied due to the fact that everyone has an opinion on the matter.furthermore... transparent production line? to what end? to complain more about stuff that may or may not get in the game?do you even have an inkling of an idea of how game development works?it's much like trying to build something from scratch... your going to run into a ton of mistakes... failed ideas...and other garbage.do you really want to add that kind of fuel to the epic fail-ness that tends to clutter up the boards?i apologize if i'm harsh... but like isaac over yonder... some of us ""thinker trolls"" grow tired of breaking of baseball bats when people gripe over the most stupidest things.point and case- the titan rumor... a rumor... no ccp dev logs.... no posts in the eve forums.just a referenced article that could have been painted or spotlighted to look like anything.and things can change rapidly in eve... we have no right to judge or predict.transparency would tempt everyone to become a serious pain in ccp's side.they have enough stress to put up with.they reserve the right to hide the greater intent of there plans.and don't kid yourself... they are in it to make money... and they know that ****ing off there clientele as a whole (not the one idiot in every crowd) is not a good idea.we got plenty to complain about as it is... ccp will not open pandoras box for satisfaction of full disclosure."
9/10/2009,"stop allowing trial account characters to post links in local and npc-corporation corp channels. then the spammers will need to activate the account before they can start spamming, or they will face cspa protection. either way, they will go broke in minutes.if the trial character will try to post a link where it would be blocked, the eve client would display a notification window, stating that the player may not post a link there before he activates his account and informing him that he can pass a link by opening a private converstation with a player he wants to send a link to, or he can send it via evemail.that way, we ensure no pilots will be harmed, only the new players who would insist on sending a link to large amount of people (sounds like a description of spammer to me).this issue has been ""kinda"" brought to csm over a year ago here, by pilot named adonis 4174, who said:pilot named tarminic then replied:and i agree, however ""www dot asshat dot com"" is not clickable, so it is much less effective for spammers.i also believe ccp devs and qa will make sure that replacing a dot with something will be impossible or extreamly hard (so also extreamly ineffective for spammers!)."
9/10/2009,while this solution is not perfect nor fool proof.it will make things a little more difficult for the jerks.supported emphatically.
9/10/2009,"case 1) undercutters aren't willing to undercut by sizable margins, and just fight for 0.01 because it's cheap. in this case, the status quo is fine - do a big undercut, and sell your stuff. case 2) undercutters don't much care about the price, and will follow any undercut you make. in this case, this proposal won't actually help you. in practice, it's of course a little bit of each. but if you want to undercut and sell your stuff fast, and find that you can't, it's not the current game mechanics preventing you from doing so, it's the fact that you haven't undercut far enough to drive out your opponents. a mechanical change won't help you."
9/10/2009,"after having to think about it more, i think that this could actually spell the death to almost any kind of margin trading, at least on more expensive items.you're just moving the problem from the winner being whoever last lowered the price by 0.01 isk to the winner being whoever put the price low enough so that one tick lower would be the buy price. might as well just start at that price and now marginal profit is cut down to the price of the tick.of course, thinking that through all the way, and many marginal traders wouldn't stand for that, would leave trading as a way of life (maybe eve?), and what you've effectively done is cut down. maybe you would see that as a benefit, but cutting out competition would actually be bad for the markets.anyways, it's all my speculation."
9/10/2009,"i dont want to sell *my* stuff fast, i want the market to move. and current game mechnics at least hinder that, because the effect of a supply/demand imbalance is soften by the possibility of 0.01 under/overbids instead of requerig meaningful under/overbids.on a side note, very interesting that almost anyone speaks specifically on selling stuff and unercutting. beleive it or not, i was pesterd by pennying mostly on the buy side."
9/10/2009,"dretzle, by ""marginal trading"", do you mean a trading strategy where you buy something quickly as a best buyer, and then attempt to be sell it quickly as a best seller? if so, please consider the following.i mentioned in the op post that i expect the bid/ask spread to become narrower and that is a benefit to everyone. you are right, i was not exact here: it is beneficial to all ""real"" buyer or seller (as opposed to speculators).now i agree to the extent that the narrower b/a spreads ruin the profitability of a ""marginal trading"" strategy. however, any speculator can easily find other, and much more profitable trading strategies, as the market also becomes more volatile - supposd he is willing to do a bit of thinking (cf. the last paragraph of my sep-3 post for an idea). (side note: a ""marginal trading"" strategy is not only not profitable, but also quite risky in a volatile market. the market can drop 10% percent easily just as you bought the goods.)one of my main goals with this proposal is, in fact, to create a market environment, where speculators has much more possibilities to profit than in today's market. this can even attract more player towards eve."
9/10/2009,"ok, this may be a small thing but when you create your own topic why should you support ? you already created the topic in the first place.also you shouldn't be able to use your alts to support your own topic too ?"
9/10/2009,"well, interesting thought.but the supports don't really mean much. basically, you are telling csm that you also like this idea. if only one man and all his 30 alts post all in support of a topic, even if they choose to consider it, ccp or csm will really only endorse it if it passes through their filters, as well.you don't need to do an extra post to support yourself. you already did by your topic. your extra post is because you like a thumb under your picture. alts giving thumbs up also means little. this is really a tossing proposals to csm channel, not a democratic, the most thumbs up wins channel."
9/10/2009,"how can you tell the difference between an alt and an account?granted most are ""obvious""but some aren't."
9/10/2009,"ironically, i support my topic loldamn i hate that 5 minute waiting.. come on ????"
9/10/2009,"the thumbs thingy and multiple alts support the topic could also influence the subject or matter in question. someone with enough knowledge with the public can bend it however he likes.like i said, minor problem but i feel like this should be addressed. this means 1 account 1 thumbs and thats it."
9/10/2009,this is a game breaking issue.please fix it.
9/10/2009,"oh cry me a river! you people won't support any changes to afk cloaking, why should we bother with a petty detail like this? working as intended, suck it up."
9/10/2009,"afk cloaking is a sensible, intended mechanic. being decloaked by incorporeal beacons is not."
9/10/2009,/me takes tears from said whiner and dumps into fuel tank for cloakkeep it coming.... keeeeep it coming./supported
9/10/2009,sounds like you're the one crying.
9/10/2009,not working as intended. good to fix.
9/10/2009,"still all this support, and no one has gone and looked for the beacon?it's there, if you show all. a little teeny box with a couple antenna sticking out.unless i've been flying into different asteroid belts than everyone else... i don't get why you're all claiming the beacons are invisible.but... i do agree cloaks should only be affected by larger, more substantial objects."
9/10/2009,"this is the real point. whether it is ""actually there"" or not, i haven't yet had the time to log on and even try to see. people just agree that warping to the center of a belt with only the teeny tiny beacon near you should not decloak.i don't think anyone really cares whether the beacon is visible. however, if this is ccp intended game mechanic, then they won't change it so no harm."
9/10/2009,you don't care because you haven't had the problem.it's there.... there are always beacons at any warp to zero point in belts missions and other various things.they just tend to not be on the overview.i've never had the issue as i tend to warp to a different distance as opposed to 0... that or a bookmark.but i'm not going to deny the potential pitfall it presents.
9/10/2009,"please reread my post. my first sentence might have been misleading, but i was referring to the part of the quote that i bolded.i do care, i do fly cov ops, and i would like this changed. what i was saying that i don't care about, and i think others in this thread don't care about, is whether the beacon is visible (and hence why would they bother logging on and looking for it)."
9/10/2009,"simple realy, like the corp hanger, i would like to see the station hanger have tabs that can be labled.currently to seperate drones, ammo, modules, and so on is to use station vaults and the sort.by tabbing the hanger you could make a tab for every type of object you want to store in that tab.this would make searching ur hanger that must faster and easier."
9/10/2009,"this is a complicated issue and really needs to be looked at:griefer corps get to wardecc industrial and mission corps, looking for easy kills and big loot, quite often against targets who to be honest are simply not capable of defending themselves. this is, lets face it, legalised piracy.i am not against piracy, in fact my main is a full on -10, lowsec bad, bad man. piracy is a perfectly valid career path with enough drawbacks to make it actually quite a hard path to walk, and rightly so, no pirate i know would have it any other way. we earn our reputation by being dangerous and hated and wear our -10 with arrogant pride.piracy is, in fact, not very lucrative, we dont do it for the isk...however, and here is the problem, a bunch of wannabe, and to be frank, often fail, pilots who are afraid of targets who shoot back, form a grief (or in their words empire wardecc) corp, they then have complete immunity form any sort of sec hit, or drawback related to piracy, and yet that is quite simply, exactly what it is...its gonna be a difficult one to solve, but i think the people on the recieving end of griefers who randomly attack non pvp corps deserve some thought here..."
9/10/2009,"no they don't deserve any thought until they can't evade wardecs without reprecussions either. this might be looked at as a part of an complete overhaul of the wardec system.i also don't see why do you bring pirating to this. you seem more like a pvp player who takes pride in a low security rating, then an actual pirate to me. pirates attack others to plunder them and make as much profit as possible. that is why they often try to ransom people instead of destroying their ships/pods. wardeccing a juicy highsesc target seems exactly something a true pirate would do.you compare wardecs to legal piracy and in a way that is true. in sort of the same way that taxes are just extortion money paid to the government or how murder is bad, but murdering people who have been judged to be guilty is okay. that -10 rating isn't there because you killed people and looted them. it is there because you disregarded and broke commonly agreed rules that govern such actions and as a consequence you are outlawed, since you showed your inability to abide by those commonly agreed upon rules.from my perspective i don't see a problem to be solved, or at least i don't agree with you what the problem is. i don't see any reason why certain corps should be exempt from wardecs just because they don't focus on pvp or aren't looking for a fight at that particular time. when you have to fight only when it suits you or only ""fair"" fights, we are talking about a sporting event not a war. do not want."
9/10/2009,"im not saying anyone should be exempt from wardeccs, i do think however that wars should be justified in some way, or failing that, there should be some sort of consequence for what is essentially piracy.it makes a mockery of the idea of concord etc, that a totally non aggresive corporation can be legally attacked without consequence, for no reason other than to 'pirate' it, either for the loot, or for an easily filled killboard.the only reason i brought up the fact that i also have a pirate, is so that no one can say im just shedding carebear tears, this is about consequences, not about stopping the possibility."
9/10/2009,"hire mercs.fight back- or learn to fight back.welcome to eve, where you man up and fight for the priviledge of doing something, against other players."
9/10/2009,"what i am essentially saying, is there should be no room for 'legal piracy'. and yes, war evasion shouldnt be possible. a legal war, should always stand. there should be the possibility of illegal wars being cancelled, the wardeccers suffering standings/sec loss or something. like war crimes basically, if there is absolutley no valid reason to have wardecc a corp, then it should be a war crime.like i said, it is a difficult situation. but at the end of the day you get this kind of scenario, someone pays their sub, spends all their time building a totally passive indy corp, gets decced by griefers, loses everything, pos's, isk, everything, and so quits the game. that is basically a loss to everyone except the griefer, who suffers no consequences whatsoever.i am all for pvp, including piracy, but piracy should be where it belongs, outside the law."
9/10/2009,"its not outside the law. it isnt piracy.there is always a reason for a wardec: you looking like someone that isk can be extracted from by force.if you dont like it go and play another game that doesnt allow pvp if you find such so distressing.at the end of the day, ccp have already given you the tools to defend yourself. if you choose not to then, well, you are going to die. a lot.the problem is with you. not the game."
9/10/2009,"ey check out the touchy griefer, look, i wasnt talking bout what is game mechanics, i was talking about what makes sence and what doesnt.clearly i am in fact a pvper, quite a successful one actually, i am just making a statement on here, about a mechanic that i think is geared towards making griefers (who actually cant fight a real fight)have an easier time of it than people who want real pvp.so, dont be touchy about it mate, just grow a pair and do some real pvp, against other pvpers. (yes the op is my alt)this is a forum for people to actually aire their views on things they think need looking at. i think the wardecc system needs looking at. griefing indies isnt war, its griefing.so unless yo have something constructive to say, rather than resort to insults, i suggest you go read c&p"
9/10/2009,you sure your a pirate?because it sounds like your a carebear who can't stop crying.seriously... if your such a badass pirate... why the hell are you whining about something you already know the answer too?yes... wardecs are broken... but whining about it is not a solution now is it.
9/10/2009,"this is exactly the placed to bring up things that you think need changing... or it was, perhaps now it is just a place for the forum warriors to vent their frustration...never mind, maybe ill just change the thread to 'what is the point of the csm?' since it is clearly now just a place for forum trolls to take their ignorance for a walk..so, since there isnt a single relevant answer on here, it may as well be locked. might as well lock the whole csm system while your at it."
9/10/2009,your not very bright are you?did you even bother to read? research? do your homework?or is it really you being the so called hated forum warrior whining about something.you know... most people who post here have solutions to the problems they point out.your's is just a side of cheese and crackers.man up for crying out loud... your pathetic.if you'd bother to search previous war-dec threads you'd see your just repeating every other sorry excuse of a whine thread.how about some solutions to the problem eh?
9/10/2009,"got to laugh, i just took a quick look across the csm forums, and you are on pretty much ever thread i looked at drake, and guess what, its an insulting post on pretty much every thread...i reckon someones overtired, got school in the morning? better ask your mum if you can have an early supper and glass of milk. oh and stop whacking off over anime pics too, it isnt good for you. dont worry mate, eventually, maybe after puberty ends you might get to kiss a girl, then you can join the adult humans that confuse you so much... we all know an angry teenager when we see one..."
9/10/2009,do you see me throwing a carebear fit over war-decs?do you see me acting like a total child claiming to be some hot shot pvp'er and complaining about getting greifed?who is it again that is wasting time here again? i seem to have lost track of that.hell i should be the one complaining... i'm the one getting greifed right now in a war-dec.but you don't see me complaining... why is that?if you can't figure that out... you don't belong here.
9/10/2009,"back to the topic...(a) you define ""griefing"" wardecs as those that are made against a corp that can't defend themselves (high-sec industry corp, for example). also, there is ""no reason"" for these wardecs (other than griefing).counter argument: (1) without doing away with the war dec mechanic completely, there is no way to tell if there is ""a reason"" for the war decs. here are a few examples that would look exactly like a ""griefing"" war dec, but are actually not: - industry corp a wants to reduce/remove competition from industry corp b. a hires mercenary/pirate/pvp corp c to war dec b. - industry corp a smack talks pvp corp b. war dec. - industry corp a sleeps with girlfriend of friend in corp b. war dec.especially the 3rd situation, there is no way to tell any of the above situations apart from a ""griefer"" war dec. not enforceable means not doable.(2) any industry corp should have a plan for war decs. this is an intended part of the game. some options are, 3rd party mercenary corp, part of larger alliance to help, combat wing, making yourself not appetizing for a fight. if it is not profitable or the other corps can't get their kicks from blowing up your fancy ships, they won't do it.(b) these corps have no drawback to their war decs.counter argument:(1) there is a cost to all war decs. you might argue that the cost is too low, that might be a different thread, but there is a cost in isk.(c) as the other posters mentioned, pointing out and discussing what you think is a broken game mechanic is for the other forums. on this forum, at the very least a solution should be suggested, though in the opinion of many here it would be a solution in search of a problem, as this is an intended game mechanic."
9/10/2009,solutions we've found in the past that worked -1: become difficult to pin down... they get tired of waiting for hours on end to kill someone.2: gather as much intelligence as possible... other corps are likely hunting them if your not able to hunt back.ultimately the popular solutions are -1: rookie frigate attack for lol's2: wait a week or 2.3: join an alliance.4: leave and stay put in a npc corp (frowned upon but still in use today) <-- we try to avoid thisi don't debate much in war-dec's other than blowing away the opossed sides because people forget there are 2 sides to every debate.if you don't reach middle ground you will never reach a rational conclusion to this.
9/10/2009,"t last, and rational replies, thank you.i have never posted here, and to be honest havnt really read the huge amount of posts, but a quick look showed up no thread on wardeccs. maybe i didnt look hard enough.anyway, thanks for the replies. yes i did get a wardecc, in another corp i also ceo, a 2 bit bunch of griefers, that we camped into their stations for a week. what annoyed me was they picked us from our recruitment thread, and thought us an easy target.turned out we basically won, with 1 bs loss and pod to their side. we lost 1 mining barge. some pvp.the argument is, basically it was attempted legal piracy, it failed, but nonetheless, i feel it wanted addressing. there should be some sort of penalty to wardeccing a corp just to try and get easy kills.i posted it here, to try and get ideas out there about it.. not to cause a n argument.i apologise for any insulting sytatements made, i just wanted sensible suggestions."
9/10/2009,"well i believe there is a problem with the wardec system. lots of holes in it. my thoughts on this is don't patch it the wardec system. just dump it and start a new one.here are some facts that doesn' make sense to me1. start a wardec for no reason ? just pure fun let say ?2. the price of the wardec. from corp to corp 2m ? what ? lol, thats way to cheap for a corp of any size.3. you can keep the wardec going, log off, log in to pay it so you continue, log off again and continue that for a whole year and its legal to do so. whats the point of that ?4. you start a corp 1 day old and you can get wardecced by let say a merc corp (i name noir. since there really good at it) and its legal ? <--- wtfsolutions: i could name a few changes here and there but its not going to serve any purpose here since the op just mentionned there a problem and peoplpe greeted him with a gunshot in the balls. my point is to name the problems and facts with my experience in case someone loses some of it in time. the op's point is to point out the problem so that someone else can find solutions or at least acknowledge there is a problem."
9/10/2009,"a solution to a majority of high sec war decs would be if people did not talk in local. all the war decs i have ever talked my ceo in doing, or having one be extended, has been when someone mouthed off in local. it is not my problem if they are a non-pvp corp, if they say something we find objectionable it becomes their problem."
9/10/2009,"for once i agree....more stupid reasons to add to the list -5: war-dec ends - 24 hours later they can reissue the same dec? wth?6: neverending war-dec potential as already listed but my specific pet peeve is there are no conditions or such things set.as to the fixes? hard to gauge considering most will argue that war-dec's aren't supposed to be ""restricted"".problem is.. such a freedom is severely abused."
9/10/2009,"uhhh lots of wardec in high sec (not all of course) are activated because they think there weak or a potential target. weak, fun choose yours. not always because someone mouthed."
9/10/2009,"lots of war decs in real life are also because the target was determined weak, fun, or because warring a vastly weaker target provided the warring country/dictator with a feeling of pride or some kind of riches.those real life wars you'd also label ""griefer"" wars, and rightly so. yet they happen. why try to prevent such in a game such as eve that doesn't even have laws/mechanics against scamming...."
9/10/2009,this is eve online... not real life.
9/10/2009,"granted. hence i gave my no in eve online terms in a post above. this was my random, hey, this proposal also doesn't make sense even for those that would want to try to compare it to real life.but i'll forgive based on the 99% probability that you couldn't help yourself and that's your knee jerk reaction to anyone that mentions the words ""real life"" on these forums."
9/10/2009,i'll take that as your 'oops' i forgot post and leave it at that.
9/10/2009,supported. nothing is so obviously wrong
9/10/2009,"no, nothing is so obviously a troll."
9/10/2009,"this would actually be even worse on lag than the old system, i'd wager. most people don't mash the scanner for five minutes at a time. if you want to address this problem, have any attempts to scan too fast just show a little timer(like a module) instead of forcing people to constantly re-click."
9/10/2009,"you know, we could just have no d scanner-unlessyou fit either a midslot module 'tachyon sensor array'or a electronics superiority rig 'tachyon sensor cluster'if you have either of those on a ship you have un-delayed d-scanner in the old style.if you dont, you have no d-scanner.oh wait, thats a bad idea. just like the one proposed in this thread.limiting the d-scanner was just feathered the nest for those that want to avoid pvp and punished roamers.roamers need to use the d scanner multple times in a very short time interval in a time critical enviromentfarmers in ravens, miners, haulers and anyone generally risk adverse in 0.0 only need to click it once on 360 degrees- and then they warp out before tackle has managed to narrow down which belt they are in."
9/10/2009,"funny thing about these threads, support doesn't really matter. you need a csm member to raise the thread, whether you have one thumb or a thousand. find a csm rep you expect to be sympathetic, toss them a convo, and ask for them to raise the issue."

9/10/2009,"supporting to offer constructive criticism and alternative solutions. i don't know about ""tachyon probes"". it just seems like it would be the preferred probe of pirates and defeat the purpose of cloaks.i suggested this idea below in another thread similar to this one.1) how about an anchorable device that needs to be anchored at a pos but not inside. this device, when activated, sends out an omni-directional pulse that decloaks everyone friend and foe in the system. this device also consumes fuel of some sort and has a 30 min cooldown to prevent spamming.if the enemy cloaker is truely afk, then he's going to be in trouble soon. if the player is at his keyboard or at least keeping an eye on his monitor, all he has to do is recloak.2) another suggestion is to allow directional scanners to pick up cloaked ships.3) and my final suggestion is for cloaking devices to consume a % of cap each cycle instead of a fixed number. obviously that percentage would have to be very low and dependent on the meta level of the cloak device, the ship type it's fitted to, and skills of the player."

9/10/2009,"look at it this way. if someone starts a wardec i really think they should attack. if they don't after some time, i really think it should be logical to think they don't want to fight. with this, why the wardec after a certain time ?i do undertand the point of station huggers and all and i do know this game well but there has to be a limit somewhere. thechnically speaking as long as the wardec pays the fee's, they could go on for months without almost no logging in and no attack ? this really makes no sense to me !"
9/11/2009,bump
9/11/2009,"i support this issue, and suggest;ishkur: 5% drone damage/hp per levelenyo: 5% hybrid rof per levelharpy: 5% hybrid rof per levelhawk: 5% missle rof per levelretribution: 5% laser rof per levelvengeance: 5% rocket rof per leveljaguar/wolf: 5% proj rof per leveledit: thanks for the update zastrow"
9/11/2009,"....well then by that logic, af's are the only t2 ships that only have 4 bonuses, and hacs, recons, cs's, etc. have 5 bonuses (5th being hidden, thats all)give assault frigs their missing 4th (or 5th :p ) bonus! :)"
9/11/2009,"technically thisbut yeah, still supportedhowever, a rocket boost should come first, then those utilizing them can get a range bonus or something"
9/11/2009,1
9/11/2009,/signed
9/11/2009,"i don't particularly care what gets done to the other af's but i do care about the jaguar and wolf.if everything is getting a rof bonus then fine, we're simply adding dps and not addressing specific issues. i don't want my ac's firing faster, i just want them to hit better, sure i can drop my speed in orbit essentially giving up the only thing a minnie af has going for it.and please, it's been requested for many months now, swap the optimal/falloff bonuses already."
9/11/2009,"fully supported.the amarr assault frigs , especially the one that lacks midslots, are really bad.also i love my harpy, some extra ship speed / tracking is needed.but not just that, like wang says, there the only t2 ships that dont recieve 4 bonuses. and you have to remeber, the assault frig is quite a lot of peoples first taste of t2 ships, at least it was mine. so you want to let them leave the ship feeling it is actually well worth the extra iskies and training."
9/11/2009,"what is this argument with the caracal anyway?-> thorax, it is missing bonuses to its drone damage (gallente weapon system).-> rupture, it is missing bonuses to its missile launchers and drones (minmatar weapon systems)-> hurricane, it is missing bonuses to its missile launchers and drones (minmatar weapon systems)-> cyclone, it is missing bonuses to its missile launchers and drones (minmatar weapon systems)-> stabber, it is missing bonuses to its missile launchers and joke drone (minmatar weapon systems)i could bring up a wide array of other ships, all of these dont see a complete 25% boost from lvl-5 skills for the hull on their weapon systems.as already lined out, kinetic missiles is the caracals (caldari) weapon system, nothing wrong with it getting the bonus for these. being able to use missiles of the other races is an added bonus, nothing more."
9/11/2009,"again you are comparing damage type switching weapons systems to range based weapons systems.hybrids are stuck with therm/kin. lasers are stuck with em/therm. missiles are stuck with low dps at any range.eve combat is based on more than just damage type.some weapons ( lasers | hybrids ) are range based.some weapons ( missiles ) are damage type based.some weapons ( projectiles ) are a mixture of both.i fail to see how a range based weapons systems inability to switch damage type has any bareing on the relevance of damage type specific bonuses for ships fitting damage type switching weapons.a comparable situation would be a range based bonus on a range based ship.i.e. a bonus that only gave extra damage to [ radio | microwave ] crystals.when i have mentioned sac i have done so to point to a ship that currently has non-racial missile bonii. to try to assertain the answer to the question would rof / dps bonii make a ship overpowered as it would get dps bonii to all damage types.sac is short range for sure, so compare it to other short range boats!is a sac overpowered compared to other short range boats ?would rof and dps bonii overpower cmb's ?for a long range example use the raven.is a cruise raven overpowered compared to other battleships ?by answering these questions you can start to see that r.o.f and dps bonii on cmb's would not overpower them."
9/11/2009,"no. i think a cmb that curently gets a 5% kinetic bonus , should get 1 bonus out of either ( r.o.f. or dps ) not both and the 5% kinetic should end up in the trash can where it belongs.e.g. a caracal should have its missile speed bonus ( complementary ) and a r.o.f. bonus ( damage ).... a omen gets laser cap use ( complementary ) and a r.o.f. bonus ( damage )yes.the 1.6% value is calculated from [5% per level / the number of engagements where kinetic is best damage choice and therefore the damage bonus is used ]doing this calculation converts ammo specific damage bonus to a dps equivelent.1.6% per player skill level is the extra dps a cmb will do over many encounter thanks to its 5% kinetic bonus.lasers/hybrids/drones/proj where bonused get bonuses to dps [ rof or damage ] so you dont need to do any maths on teh number its currently stated as dps."
9/11/2009,"emphasis added. ""let me illustate the issue another way.""you are comparing apples and oranges for the most part. first of all you are comparing missiles to turrets. there are 3 types of turrets in the game (with 2 subtypes, long and short ranged, each); however missiles is its own type. the difference between launchers and turrets is that turrets are varied and have distinct drawbacks.for energy the limitation is em/therm damage only. in fact, it is always mostly em no matter what crystal you choose, the crystal adjusts range and cap usage. there is no parallel for that in launchers. how would a range combat tactic become equivalent to a damage type combat tactic?for hybrid the drawback is that is uses both capacitor and ammunition. furthermore damage type is always a combination of kinetic and thermal, rather swapping ammo only alters effective range. a further drawback is that the long range hybrid turrets are very long ranged while the short ranged ones are likewise extremely short ranged. it can be suicide to enter a situation with rails or blasters and not have missiles or drones to fill the void (hence the caldari and gallentean tendency of turrets with missiles or drones respectively*). how would a range combat tactic become equivalent to a damage type combat tactic?for projectile turrets the falloff is long. they require constant reloading which decreases dps and the artillery are very low dps due to low rof. the benefit of projectiles is that they take no cap, but this is further balanced out by, honestly, how much suck they are. the only reason to use projectiles is if you absolutely need cap and can't afford other turrets in your layout. sure projectiles do different damage types but they all come in fixed ratios with fixed ranges. the only way to switch damage types with projectiles effectively is if you can control range since your damage type would dictate the effective range of your turrets. also there would be a 10 second reload time while you ""optimize"" for your opponent, which wouldn't be much of an optimization anyway since you still do a spread of damage types.how would a spread of damage type combat tactic become equivalent to a focus of damage type combat tactic?none of these compare well with launchers, which take no cap, do great alphastrike damage, are equally effective everywhere within their range, and can be focused into one damage type only out of all 4 damage types just as quickly as projectiles can be converted into a slightly more efficient spread.trying to compare the range/cap versatility of freq crystals or hybrid ammo is apples to oranges. trying to compare the damage type optimization of missiles to projectiles also fails miserably since projectile ammo is always spread and cannot be optimized. launchers already avoid most of the drawbacks of turrets, which are each a unique combination of advantages and disadvantages which give them character -- not opness.no one is arguing that. rather we are pointing out that the damage type spread of projectile turrets cannot be focused into one damage type only (but you come closest with explosive anyway) and that allowing launchers to do that without the range and tracking issues of turrets would be ridiculously op; particularly since ammo swapping for most turrets is a range changing mechanism that launchers never needed."
9/11/2009,"its not just about the cara dude, i have quoted cara in some instances for making an example.and its not an argument, its a difference of opinion :).its my premise that the ships in the op are underpowered in general compared to there class equivelents in other races, especially when it comes to solo / small gang pvp.this i attribute to the poor nature of the damage bonus they recieve.kinetic missiles are ammunition. the weapons system is the class of launcher concerned.cmb's recieve there ""damage bonus"" to an ammuntion type ""kinetic"".there class equivilents in other races recieve damage bonuses to the weapons systems and through that any ammuntion they choose to fire.using missiles of other races.what you consider an ""added bonus"" others including myself would consider ""a vital combat tactic"" especially for small gang / solo work.the ""vital combat tactic"" of switching to appropriate ammo means that a cmb recieves no damage bonus to anything what so ever !!! in 2 out of 3 fights.you can talk forever i'm sure about bonuses which ships dont get.i'm more interested in bonuses that ships do get , and whether they need replacing with something more appropriate."
9/11/2009,"supportedi fly caldari/gallente/minmataralas i don't think you're going to get a lot of support.and to those people repeating the same mantra: you can switch ammo type, you can switch ammo type, you can switch ammo type...why should i switch ammo type if it completely negates all the time and money i spent on training cruiser v, battlecruiser v, command ship v?? soon as i switch ammo type i lose the bonus to be gained from those levels.yes i do switch ammo type depending on enemy resists, but it makes me cry."
9/11/2009,and i cry every time i shoot something tanked for thermal. (ogre ii) quitcherbellyachin
9/11/2009,"rottan quote. sorry to much to quote.please read the op + follow thread.i know there is a lot there.apples and oranges , good phrase and you are quite right.i have not started any subthreads in here comparing the merits of different weapons systems.i have attempted to answer any subthreads in here comparing the merits of different weapons systems.but as you say there apples and oranges.you have gone on to start a subthread with about 25 different parameters to consider.the purpose of the op is not to compare weapons types to one another.the purpose of the op is to ask the very simple question.is it appropriate to have a 5% per level bonus to a specific damage type ( kinetic ) on ships that use damage type switching tactics cmbs ?"
9/11/2009,"i somewhat ran out of characters, so this one might be a bit shorter. perhaps since damage bonuses are all you're interested in, the following would be more appropriate:should be changed to:amarr damage bonus is not compatable with damage type combat tactics.gallente damage bonus is not compatible with damage type combat tactics.minmatar damage bonus is not really compatible with damage type combat tactics due to damage type spread inherent to ammo used and how ammo alters optimal range. caldari damage bonus is not compatible with damage type combat tactics.so no real problem there."
9/11/2009,answer: yes.answer: ships do not use tactics. players do. some ships are more efficient at certain tactics than others. when a player uses a ship outside of a stereotype they can set themselves up for a phenomenal fail or win.
9/11/2009,"so do i. but last time i checked, all my drone types benefit from my ""drone damage per level"" bonus."
9/11/2009,"this.dude i so know.gallente hate us , and would bite out there tongues before admitting there might be a problem.minmatar are too wrapped up complaining about there own ships that they might for a second consider others have issues too, they want there own stuff sorted first.amarr might occasionally throw us some support , but dont like the fact we get multiple damage types.75% of caldari just shoot scourge and get on with it.caldari dont complain nearly enough on these forums.i have loathed this bonus for 5 years.it made me train mini i hated it that much."
9/11/2009,"ah- but in case you haven't looked at their stats lately, the different racial drones have different damage modifiers. thermal being gallente's damage type of choice, ogres have the highest damage mod by far- why should i train heavy drone operation v only to use ogre ii's when there are 3 other damage types that should be equally viable? it's the same argument as yours- and you don't see me complaining."
9/11/2009,"i'll say i tried to quote you 6 times but the brower couldnt cope with char limit.you certainly had a lot to say on comparing weapons systems after chiding me for comparing weapons systems , which i hadnt even initiated if you bothered to read the thread.are you sure you wouldnt like to change it further to ?amarr damage bonus is not compatable with damage type combat tactics.luckily for amarr , amarr dont use damage type combat tactics.gallente damage bonus is not compatible with damage type combat tactics.luckily for gallente , gallente dont use damage type combat tactics.minmatar damage bonus is really compatible with damage type combat tactics due to damage type spread inherent to ammo used and how ammo alters optimal range. luckily for minmatar , they get rof and dps bonuses which grant more dps to any damage type they fire at whatever range that ammo works.caldari damage bonus is not compatible with damage type combat tactics.screw the caldari , i'd rather eat my tongue than see those squidies get a level playin field."
9/11/2009,"i'm afraid i don't see it as the same argument. it would only be the same argument if the bonus was:""drone damage per level to thermal drones only"""
9/11/2009,"if ""damage type combat tactics"" means using whatever damage type your opponent has the least resistances to, then the innate spread in damage types that is inherent to all projectile ammo denies the ability to specify your damage type. sure, you have all 4 available to you, but you can never do less than 2 damage types. i don't see how this makes something impossible by game mechanics ""really compatible"" furthermore any attempt to change damage type to find resistance holes will alter the optimal range of your turrets. therefore any ship flown which attempts to use these tactics must also be fitted to always control range in combat.also i'm not sure why you're bashing me so harshly for bringing anything that i consider relevant into the discussion. if you think it is irrelevant please show me how. otherwise you are flaming me personally, something that you slammed lili lu for earlier in this thread, and yet have commited both to her and to myself. honestly, if you're really looking for change, i'd suggest considering that the people with the power, if they read this thread, are going to read it in its entirety.i don't see how the differences between turrets and launchers is irrelevant to a bonus to missiles. a bonus to all frequency crystals (i.e. all laser turrets) has to do with giving a bonus to the whole spectrum of range. on the other hand all missiles of the same category have the same range, and damage type is what they modify instead. the correct counter-argument, instead of ""gallente drone bonus should only be thermal drones"" (which brings a 3rd type of offense into play) would be that certain amarr ships should only provide a bonus to infrared, microwave, and radio crystals while others provide a bonus only to miltifrequency, gamma, and x-ray crystals.to repeat what i just said, but perhaps a bit clearer, is that the ship bonus should modify the effect that changing ammo has to make all other faction ships come in line with caldari. thus, amarrian and gallentean ships have bonuses that apply only to short or long ranged ammo, not the whole spectrum, and minmatar ships have more specific bonuses that apply to ammo based on a combination of range and damage types.but that certainly isn't very feasible or well thought-out now, is it? after all, targets closer than optimal range are penalized by tracking and targets farther than optimal range are penalized by falloff, so there is no need to further penalize ships for mounting turrets based on ammunition. on the other hand launchers are not like turrets in this regard and thus their ship bonuses are not required to be as selective.i think i'm done for this thread, based on reading it i think you are being purposefully bull-headed, and no offense meant by that; it's just my honest opinion, which stems partially from your vehement and mocking reply.""screw the caldari , i'd rather eat my tongue than see those squidies get a level playin field."""
9/11/2009,"by joe, i think we have a viable alternative!"
9/11/2009,introduce new split damage missiles that do 50% kinetic and 50% other damage. would make the kinetic bonus useful while still retaining caldari kinetic racial damage flavor. although your idea is faster and better.
9/11/2009,"this is what i've been aiming to say, and apparently i've been missing.you can't compare a bonus on one ship to a bonus on another ship without comparing the ships, the weapon systems, and all of the ship balance considerations together. and you can't compare those assuming that a player will do one thing or another thing. balance in eve is an insanely complex web; and at this point i don't think there is anything inherently unbalanced about a bonus to kinetic missiles only on some caldari ships."
9/11/2009,"its really simple. to compare one bonus to another you just have to convert the bonus to be of the same type.e.g. convert a kinectic bonus to a dps bonus.damage and r.o.f are easy to convert to dps.5% damage is = to 5% dps5% r.o.f. is almost = to 5% dps ( you do have to take into consideration , reload time ).for a kinetic only bonus you need to make an assumption as to how often the bonus gets used.if your using kinetic in 1/3 engagements then you take the kinetic bonus value and divide by 3.people can waffle on endlessly about tracking,optimal,falloff,damage types or lack of them,range and whatever and before you know where you are your completelly lost.so keep it simple. theres no need to worry about the difference between guns and missiles its all irrelevant when you just want to compare bonuses.mini damage bonuses are 5% r.o.f. ( ~5% dps ) and 5% damage ( 5% dps ).amarr damage bonuses are 5% r.o.f. ( ~5% dps ) and 5% damage ( 5% dps ).gallente damage bonuses are 5% r.o.f. ( ~5% dps ) and 5% damage ( 5% dps ) and 10% drones ( 10% dps ).caldari bonuses are 5% kinetic ( 1.6% dps ) and 5% r.o.f. ( ~5% dps).on the further question of balance there are ships out there allredy with r.o.f. and damage bonuses to missiles , they arnt overpowered.so correcting this inadequate bonus on cmb's is unlikelly to create any hugelly overpowered ships.and if it does they can allways be tweaked afterwards.missile have been nerfered so many times now , its about time missile users got some love to help bring the ships up to par.the kinetic flavour of caldari would be better placed on the ammuntion itself , in the same way that the damage flavours of the other races are applied.then cmb's can have decent bonuses they dont lose during combat , and people who have trained up levels in these ships can benifit from that training."
9/11/2009,"there is a damn good reason for it not getting a damage bonus, and that is the convenience of being able to switch damage types freely. its the same with projectiles, if you want to use different damage types you lose base dps.lets take the caracal again, say you are shooting a thorax. by switching to explosive missiles instead of going against a 58% kinetic resist you go against a 42% explosive resist.all level 5 skills, 100 base dps for easy maths:kinetic: (100*1.25)*0.42 = 52.5explosive: (100*1)*0.58 = 58the simple fact is you dont need a damage bonus, your bonus is being able to switch to off-race damage. just be glad you have that ability at all tbh, unlike gallente and amarr.flying caldari, not supported."
9/11/2009,"well i'm glad you can see the issue , even if you dont consider it an issue.level 5 pilot 58 dps , level 2 pilot 58 dps.^^ your numbers sir , on which other races does this happen.a level 2 pilots doing the same dps as a level 5 pilot i mean.not an issue ?you may not care about it , but it is still the issue with cmb'sno other races lose there training time when in combat why should caldari ?"
9/11/2009,"no, not an issue, as they are deliberately choosing ammo types where the bonus doesnt apply.caldari doesnt if they use the proper ammo type.on the other hand, no race can freely switch damage types on their primary weapon system without penalty, why should caldari?"
9/11/2009,in your exampleif a level 2 pilot chooses his ammo exp.then the level 5 pilot has no way of doing more damage than the level 2 pilot.whatever ammo he chooses.25 days training for ?a bonus that does not work !minmatar can switch damage types without losing even 1 percent of there bonus.whatever ammo a mini pilots chooses a level 5 pilot get 15% more than a level 2.
9/11/2009,"if he chooses kinetic, he gets his bonus. again, not getting a bonus to damage types other than kinetic is the penalty for being able to switch damage types freely. you are supposed to use kinetic missiles.the bonus does work, if you deliberately choose to not use it its your problem.and if you want to compare with minmatar damage switching ability, caldari dont even need to train a skill to get the full benefit from a different ammo types, thats an oversight.but to pick up your concern, here is my proposal:convert bonus to a 5% rof (which is still a damage boost compared to a dmg bonus!), and add a 20% damage penalty to em, thermal and explosive missile damage to all the hulls. problem solved, pilots with lvl-5 skills are better off, and the racial damage is preserved."

9/11/2009,i lost hope... i am pretty sure that at this point this accurately represents ccp's stance on this.=)i would be happy with a grayed out button in lieu of an annoying error message.
9/11/2009,"so... perhaps we should take this to general discussion, as ccp seems to not read this section of the forums.everyone repost there! :doh and this change is less than optimal, obviously... doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure that one out."
9/11/2009,"i actually got a reply from a gm about this whole ""ccp not reacting"" and he said the issue should be written down in ""features and ideas discussion"" because this gets actually monitored by the devs. and to raise it to the csms ...if someone would open a good thread in faid it would be cool ... i won't, i'm bad at writing."
9/11/2009,"i see this is by a csm, and i think oh sh*t. but then i realize that he is a goon and i am like, damn i just got trolled.the sad part is ccp probably thinks that probing is a viable option to using an inty to search belts..."
9/11/2009,just poasting to say the csm and its attendant forums are about as effective as they have ever been..good luck with the initiative.
9/11/2009,"either improve the directional scanner so that we don't have to click multiple times to find our target or remove this 2 second limit. to improve it, you might want to add markers on the 360 circle relative to the ship scanning. this marker needs to be updated as the ship is warping. these markers indicate what is appearing on directional scan."
9/11/2009,why isn't this on page one? i'm still for this idea even if it takes an entire expansion to do it.666...anyone got some holy heavy water to cleanse my pod?
9/11/2009,"pos are a buggy mess and that's why ccp is moving away from them for sovereignty mechanics in dominion. i can venture to guess that with their removal from a central role in sov they now can be tinkered on without massively impacting alliance warfare. furthermore it sounds like the ""infrastructure hub"" that was mentioned in the most recent dev blog thread is going to incorporate these ideas."

9/11/2009,"i don't believe that folders are preserved across multiple installations of eve, yet the bookmarks themselves do reside on the server. i used to make folders for them and stuff, but then one day my hard drive crashed. when i reinstalled eve, i found that i still had all several hundred bms, but they were all lumped into one big folder - not organized into the many folders i had taken the time to put them into. since then i haven't bothered to try again, and my places window just gets slower and slower or maybe this was just an isolated incident...?"
9/11/2009,"anyone that actually not support, is doing exploration or live in wormholes ?.if they were temp bookmarks no one would make you use them.obviously supported."
9/11/2009,"ah, hadn't seen that before. that's not good.i don't use wormholes (yet) either, but i would have supported those whole-heartedly (if i had been around). i just think there's a better solution than ""temp bookmarks"" for his problem.i just didn't think they would be useful based on the problem lobster man was trying to solve in his main post. folders work better.as he pointed out, folders don't work if your hard drive crashes, apparently, but there's got to be a better solution than temp bookmarks for that. just mho."
9/11/2009,"lobster, yes, bookmarks are stored on your hard drive. yes, it's ******ed. might i suggest deleting most of those hundreds? jpc2, i do exploration and wormholes. i'm not hardcore about it, but i do fully understand why you would want this. i just don't think it's the right solution to the problem - like i said, ""time created"" would be much better imo."
9/11/2009,"supporting it because options are good. options help those who would use them, and they don't harm those who would not. i personally wouldn't use this option, i turn my old exploration bookmarks into ""safes""."
9/11/2009,"you are vey wrong1. even if setting temp bookmark is as much cliking as the deleting it , its so much better to set up proper bookmark at the beggining and dont bother with it anymore.2. time created table would solve nothing. some bookmark are usless just after finishing sites some are usless after several hours ( wormholes , or unfinished plexes you want to do,finish later )you would have to spend time thinkin : is it done already ? it this wh gone etc. it is as much pain as it is now.btw some bookmarks are static f.e insta undock = those are good for foldering not the temporarly ones."
9/11/2009,"i am aware of all of those things. this is why bookmarks have names - bookmark sites with ""1"", ""2"", etc. and clear them out in order, and use descriptive names for anything longer-term. and time created is just fine - yeah, it doesn't differentiate the stuff you were doing an hour ago, but it means stuff from three days ago you can clear out easily. that gets rid of most of the bloat, and given that the proposal was for a 36-hour timer on temporaries, that's all this proposal would let you do anyways. nothing automated is going to read your mind and clear out the bms you don't care about, so you're either going to have to clear them out by hand or use some sort of simplified rule. and if you're using a rule, time created is the same thing without all the ""my bookmarks disappeared!"" whining from idiots clogging the petition queues."
9/11/2009,"there's an idea i've had when adding my own personal bpos into the corp hangar.it would be nice if i could join a corp and ""share"" my bpos with corp members without the ability for them to be held to ransom should i decide to leave. at the moment the only way to do this is to allow them to be locked down in a corp hanger and hope that the ceo doesn't go awol or decide that he's not going to give them back to me.just a thought for when this is finally given some dev time."
9/11/2009,"can't support it.personally, if tracking were added to sentry guns, i'd consider that a more proper rebalancing - i still have reservations about that, as well.i knew when i started flying gallente boats that sentries would engage my drones if i had gcc - it has yet to stop me from flying them."
9/11/2009,if you're a gallente pirate and say you aren't severely hindered by sentries you're full of it. the whole global aggression system needs fixed period. why should two pirate corps in rr bs gangs fighting each other get sentry fire and lose drones. anyone against this is a carebear sick of getting killed because they suck.

9/11/2009,"when ccp introduced the nano/web nerfs i remember them saying something about how they were thinking of doing something to the rapier/huggin, but sadly they did not. it is about time they did something, although i don't know if i can honestly see ccp boosting a minmatar ship even if the whole forum supports the topic. ah well, worth a try *click*"
9/11/2009,add the percentage of kills too against the losses as profit :)that would help account for bad luck.
9/11/2009,"just do like lots of other mmo out there, you click on log off and the game makes you wait 10 secs. you have to wait that time while doing nothing and then boom, you disapear and get out of the game.for the disconnection. ccp could log these things very easily i presume. i think they can make that difference. if you click it, it gets logged. if he didn't click on log off then the game registers it as an accidental disconnection (my wife running her truck over the fiber optic cable cause she's sick i'm playing this game lmao)."
9/11/2009,"and how would that keep players from just unplugging their network cable for a second to get a quick disconnect?besides, if you drop with network issues, you already have a pretty long delay before the server even notices the client is gone.in fact, in laggy fleet fights i've had it many times that the server didnt even realized i dropped, ship was still where i left it, even targets still locked...thats kind of the problem imo, the current mechanic favors the logoff on purpose but doesnt really help if you have network issues in the heat of combat."
9/11/2009,you presume falselyyou cannot possibly detect a disconnect from a log off in any form of the manner.and as its already been pointed out.. just unplugging the network card or shutting off your modem would be easily accomplished.it's not a matter of getting the signal.. its the false positives that are the problem.
9/11/2009,i may not be an expert on this but i believe that 500 people (made up number. could be more or less) logging on in a short period of time will actually make the server lag... so by creating some kind of log off and log on delay mechanic should help this lag. that may be why your getting deconnected from the game cause of an ******* or more disconnecting either on purpose or not.and for the 10 sec... the delay. if it disconnect before 10 then its clearly not timed from ccp
9/11/2009,that is already in place it is called login queue. ever tried to login after server crashes?
9/11/2009,note added the exploit rule that is broken.
9/11/2009,"ive seen this exploited too often, its really stupid."
9/11/2009,giving support for this... seeing it time and time again being abused... it's sad.
9/11/2009,its sad when people have to do this to get themselfs out dieing. its a game who cares about dieing
9/11/2009,this topic is in serious need of attention
9/11/2009,i have to agree with cheeky here. what should be underlined here is the fact of rendering oneself *invulnerable* through the abuse of game mechanics.
9/11/2009,"supported, this bug is unacceptable as it is hard to prove, though anyone with half a brain can tell when it is happening."
9/11/2009,"this has to be taken care of. the problem is not the initial emergency warp out. the problem is yet another and another with every log out. probing ships with the new mechanics is already sucky, and the multi-log-on-off trick is mocking a persuing fleet.you don't even need to really wait to see if anything lands on you - you just open multiple clients and hit the login button on the extra whenever you're half way through entering space.*thumbs up*"
9/11/2009,"^ thisi have been caught at least once after dc (i logged out because my computer froze during a major fight), died, petitioned because i tought i didn't warp at all as i should. logs showed i did, it was my mistake, they killed me fair and square using probers. i have no complaints about this. the person that logged off / crashed is still lockable and it's possible to kill him. using multiple clients logging into same account to gain invurnability is the real problem."
9/11/2009,"characters using this bug to exploit their way out of losing ships really detracts from the enjoyment of the game. when you have a player logging in and out 4 times for instance, and probe them out immediately each time, and are invulnerable to scrams and bubbles and target locks the game is no longer fun.this needs to be fixed.qft1. exploitsan immediate permanent ban of an account may result if:* e. a player renders himself invulnerable through the use of a bug."
9/11/2009,"well, this is a problem in my opinion.further, its curious putting your usage of a questionable mechanic as a pro-argument for it. sure, you travel far away and just log in the hostile territory on the slightest danger because its safe, this is exactly the point and suggestion for change in this concern!!you will have to either come back from your roaming to safe regions or, simply, die if you cant. chasing the enemy must be rewarded, roaming into hostile space must have higher risks.logging in space safely where your ship magically disappears is just ridiculous..."
9/11/2009,"these are related issues, just saying there is more to fix then only the mentioned logoff-exploit"
9/11/2009,"ships should return to the point where they first emegency warped, before being able to do another emergency warp."
9/11/2009,off course randomly entering from a different spot is fine but s long as they re-enter the same location as they left.
9/11/2009,caladri navy drakegallente navy myrmadonrepuplic fleet hurricaneamarr navy harbingerplease.
9/11/2009,why?
9/11/2009,"cnd - 8 launchers and a black paint job please.because i want to fly them.because they would be uber.because they are currently mia. navy frigs v , navy cruisers v , navy bc x , navy bs vwhy not ?"
9/11/2009,"of the reasons you list above the only one that even applies is because they currently don't exist leaving a hole in the ships supplied by the navy that doesn't make any kind of logical sense. of course, by that logic, we should get navy destroyers too.that said, i'm not sure there's enough justification for bringing them into existence. what kind of role are they going to fill in the combat capabilities of the navies that a non-navy version doesn't? let's face it, the current battlecruisers fill that combat niche fairly well without creating navy versions of them.i'm going to go with a no on this unless somone can come up with some kind of role to justify their existence (besides they'd be cool to have)."
9/11/2009,navy ferox hell yeah
9/11/2009,"i'd support this, well, for the tier 2 bc's tier 2 bc's have no faction variant, nor a t2 variant, the tier 1's however do, so why not show the tier 2's some love?your comment about navy destroyers does have kinda a valid point, but destroyers do have a t2 variant at least, interdictors.i'd make 50 noobs ragequit eve for a navy myrm.and let's face it, a navy hurricane would be f'ing awesome.so, my reason in a nutshell:cause tier 2 bc's have absolutely no variant of any kind.frigs/as/inty/covops and stealth bombersdestroyer/interdictorcruiser/force and combat recon/hac's/hic'sbattleship/faction battleship/marauder/black opstier 1 bc/command ship varianttier 2 bc/???"
9/11/2009,"i support this.i would so love a 8/5/6 slot navy harbinger in black it would be my favorite ship.. its true, no lies!"
9/11/2009,i will fly dis ship.
9/11/2009,"if ccp had been on the ball, these would have been the rewards for the l4 epics, instead of seven pieces of vendor trash and some godly pos lab that retails for a third of a billion. i don't say that because they're especially necessary, but they are something people want, and they do have the benefit of being balanced across all four races. seriously though, i think ccp is waiting to release these. they know we want them, they know what they'd look like, they just haven't had the right occasion to bring them out. game design isn't always about bringing out every cool idea right away - sometimes you have to leave stuff in the bag."
9/11/2009,this x 1000000!!!!!1111oneoneoneoneoneoneone!!!11111one
9/11/2009,"curiously, i don't find your reasons particularly compelling. ""it would be uber."" is a reason you use when your 14""i want to fly them."" is literally the reasoning of a 3 year old."
9/11/2009,"already have a navy drone boat in the vexor, do want navy brutix."
9/11/2009,near invincible?yeah... right.no one is invincible... not even a cloaked ship.secondly... your going to get flamed to hell and back... starting with the wormhole space folks.never mind low sec/null sec.regardless... odds are by the time you see a probe... your not guaranteed to escape in time... that's not including alignment time and warping off.you still are fully capable of ambushing regardless.this would make the hunter-killers near invincible (in this case) and guaranteed to get gank kills without chance of losing there prey... with no warning what so ever... they have a guarenteed shot unless they are a total idiot.. and most pilots aren't when they are intent to hunt and kill.argument or not... you won't get support for this aside from blood thirsty pvp'ers.this is a classic pirate vs carebear argument... and we all know where those go.
9/11/2009,"i disagree- yes, it will buff pirating on low/no sec systems- however the smart carebear will adapt quickly by doing things like moving off the warp-in beacon, or pointing their ship in the direction of a celestial without moving towards it, to reduce align time if they do need to warp out.again- i think this change should be paired with a much needed buff to low/nullsec rewards- give people a reason to go to lowsec, and they'll find a way. maybe it'll mean doing things like i've suggested above, or maybe it'll mean traveling in larger, more protected groups- but at the end of it all, it will mean more reward in exchange for more risk.to me, it's not a question of how safe you should be in your safespot, or how easy it should be to gank someone in their safespot- it's a question of what probes are there to do, and i believe their function is a covert tool to get a warp-in on your target."
9/11/2009,you know probes are limited to the unfiltered directional scanner view already. pain in the a** from the start. you can easily overlook them with some wrecks or so in space. and now you want to remove them fully and buff ganking?
9/11/2009,this proposal makes me snicker
9/11/2009,"i agree that the current system is dumb- either you should be able to add/remove them from your overview & d-scanner, or you shouldn't. however, that doesn't change the fact that i think the system as a whole needs to be changed."
9/11/2009,your suggestion makes no sense. i would rather recommend you bump the thread with adding them to the overview.
9/11/2009,"i'm not sure what's confusing you-- d-scanning for probes is by far most commonly used by low-sec mission runners and 0.0/wh plexers- low-sec/0.0/wh are supposed to be dangerous places- anyone good at d-scanning for probes is for all intensive purposes invincible- because they are near invincible, there is little to no additional risk in low-sec --just more work in watching your scanner like a hawk- i believe that in the current system, the rewards and the risk of low-sec/0.0/wh space need a buff"
9/11/2009,"- d-scanning for probes is by far most commonly used by low-sec mission runners and 0.0/wh plexersuh yeah... so people can not be ""wtfbbgpwn""'d all the freaking time.- low-sec/0.0/wh are supposed to be dangerous placeswho said they weren't to begin with?-"
9/11/2009,"and what kind of intel method would be left for the mission runner vs a gang of recons? good probers already get a bs/bc in less than 30s.your workarounds with ""align out"" and ""leave warpin beacon"" dont always work."
9/11/2009,"again- to put it simply, yes, this is a nerf to insecure space. i'm not claiming that it's a buff. i am, however, saying that were this change to take place, it should be paired with a major buff to the rewards of insecure space versus highsec mission running.drake- my argument is that it's silly to force yourself to spam the d-scanner button every 2 seconds. i believe that this nerf to insecure space as paired with a buff to insecure space would improve the game. would you not agree that it's stupid to have to spam that button? i think that insecure space needs to be buffed to the point where people have enough reward waiting for them to outweigh the risk of not seeing probes coming their way."
9/11/2009,spamming the directional scanner button and removing proves from the directional scanner/probing sensor grid is a completely unrelated and totally different mechanic.hell at that rate you should take the frakking ds away all together because thats what your really shooting for.the ds will still pick up ships.... and even then most smart pilots will use cloaking devices to shield from prying eyes... never-mind that the ds is utterly useless as its limited range wont let you pick up much other than the immediate vicinity and not solar system wide with your proposed changes... they wont even use it anymore at that point... which means there's no incentive of a slight chance of survival in low sec/0.0.even if the ds was buffed with a 32 au range or some such... this idea is ludicrous.i'm sorry... but its warped beyond all reason.and with that i will argue no further as your just flat delusional./thread
9/11/2009,"not supported, using a directional scanner, whether for survival (making sure not getting probed down), or for hunting, is part of low-sec life."
9/11/2009,"exactly. low-security and no-security space is not meant to be secure. it is meant to be a place where there's no safe place to hide but the station. on the flip side of that, it's meant to have comparable incentives, that encourage people to enter the dangerous space by offering great rewards.once again- with the game the way it is, this change wouldn't make sense. i am proposing this change under the condition that low/no-security space received a major buff to justify the new danger.agreed- it is /part/ of low-sec life. and it should be. you'd still scan for ships- though the real counter to this d-scanner nerf would be better protecting yourself in the first place. the point of low/no-security space is to be dangerous. if you want to run a cap recharger fit on your navy mega and not get killed by a solo pilgrim, do it in high-security space. if you want more rewards for more risk, take a few friends to low-sec and run level 5's with cap transfers and rr so it would take a large pirate gang to kill you."
9/11/2009,hey hersch...i think i found your problem.
9/11/2009,"they're called ""interceptors"""
9/11/2009,trollstfu and wait till ccp says it before you cry.
9/11/2009,rephrased from something someone said in another thread:make a convincing argument for why titans as they currently stand are fun.then come back here and say they should be kept as they are or (lol) buffed.
9/11/2009,"don't come complaining when bad people show up every time with a few hundred for regular systems, and up to 2k pilots for important system, once the threat of mass losses is removed :pno other factors stop a blob than this really: big risk + big losses. not cost, not time, not even an opposing force of approximate or similar numbers. tbh, just think of it for a moment. ccp is restricting cyno jammers to station systems every other system, every cyno they use, every bridge they use, every move they make is subject to both conventional and capital hotdrops they're glass cannons now. one group of players throw them around in increasing numbers because they are afraid of risk, and will do everything to mitigate risk. the other group of players does use them, conservatively, in specific circumstances even, but still uses them as glass cannons ... it takes a normal non capital fleet under a minute to melt one, and under 30 seconds to catch one.boosting hitpoints is not going to solve anything, no siege mode idea will let these ships stand up. player populations increase and evolve in capacity and capability. removing the area effect dd is counterproductive, it takes away the only thing which stops blind blobbing. but there has to be a limit. privately i am surprised ccp have not used the solution already present in the storylines. granted, player titans are smaller then those of the empires, but the same danger of gravitational drama and planets going belly up exist."
9/11/2009,"buff stealth bombers, amirite?"
9/11/2009,"i was thinking roughly the same thing actually. blobs do need a counter, but wether titans should be it, i don't think so. bombers are much more accessible, and expendable. and the article did mention something about a new class of fighter-bombers. having a cheap anti-blob mechanic would do far more to combat blob frequency than the titan ever would."
9/11/2009,"not really. it remains a problem of scale. a fighter bomber won't in all likelyness one volley a fleet battleship, that would be really unbalanced as it would open up the door to excess once more. would becoem hilarious to just stack hictors all over the places and for the rest just remote assign from a pos. such risk bombs, well, yeah those are really effective in engagements of 400+ to 400+ i do not like the concept of the doomsday a lot, i have to admit. but in scenarios of 0.0 where the risk should be high as the rewards are rather very plenty, and where solid organisation is a key instrument on every level, it is not a big problem to overcome.it's the deterrent element of a doomsday that works, cause most of the time the pilots using them kinda suck and miss"
9/11/2009,save the titans?? kill the titans!!!!they are annoying like sh*t and should be removed from the game entirely!fffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu..|..
9/11/2009,"the doomsday is the single worst thing to ever happen to the game. yes, a single doomsday can easily be tanked by a bs, but only scrubs ever fire a single dd anymore. it's always double and triple dds now. the inherent problem with them is that they completely wipe the floor with the opposing fleet and are rarely on grid for more than a few minutes. literally the only way to kill a titan as it stands right now is if the titan pilot makes an absolutely horrible mistake. it just doesn't make for very compelling gameplay, either. over the course of the delve war, we ended up missing out on a lot of potentially entertaining fights when an opposing gang would get doomsdayed. you can't justify something like that just because it's expensive, everyone has money and titans are becoming less and less of a big deal. you'd have to be a ****ing moron to think that things are going to be fine the way they are as everyone and their grandmother gets their hands on a titan."
9/11/2009,"overview:currently, when fighting in heavily populated areas (whether that be in high-security trade hubs, or 0.0 pos-bash blobs), the loot often goes to the person with the fastest internet connection who is least involved in the fight (since they can focus on snatch & grabbing loot while the people fighting have to pay attention to their own ships).issue:the players risking their ships in pvp combat (or pve for that matter) are often missing out on rewards that should go to them.proposed solution:a short timer (the length to be determined by ccp- probably around 1 minute, to coincide with the aggression timer) should be introduced. this timer starts as soon as a ship- player or npc is destroyed. during this timer, the only people who can loot from the wreck are those in the corporation of the player who gave the final blow, or those in the corporation of the player who's ship was lost. after that appr 1 minute timer, the wreck is fair game. all the while, the same looting aggression mechanics are in play. (i do think that looting the wreck of a ship i've destroyed should flag the looter to me- but that's for another thread)summary: a kills b. for the first 1 minute, the only people who can loot b's wreck are members of a's corporation or b's corporation. that way, we still allow scavengers to loot & salvage- but the people who went through the trouble to kill the thing get first dibs."
9/11/2009,no. learn to salvage faster.
9/11/2009,"no. the wreck is owned by the person who died. so logically you should limit the looting time to them and their corp. not you.once ccp also gives you some kind of ownership (which implies loot thieves get flagged towards you), the timer would also block you.that said ... i dont want to wait 1minute to loot, when the scout already shouts ""reinforcements incoming"" => not supported."
9/11/2009,"why the #### would someone be interested in the loot in the context of a massive pvp blobb in 0.0/low sec?hell i'd be more interested in surviving the damn fight...i seriously doubt anyone is going to be interested in loot in a fight such as that.and in case you forgot... there are no bloody rules or mechanics to stop you from shooting back regardless!now in high sec?it already exsists... its called ""can tipping"" (wreck == can)salvage? its been clearly indicated by ccp that wrecks are free for all.. even if stealing the wrecks are considered theft to the majority of the population.all this mechanic is doing is making something a hell of alot more complicated than it is.and in 0.0... its pointless... as you can do whatever the hell you want when it pleases you.low sec.. same thing... just get dinged by sec hits."
9/11/2009,"this proposal was referring to looting- not salvaging.not sure i understand- so basically, you're saying that because under the current mechanic, the wreck is flagged as owned by the corp who lost it, you don't think it should be flagged to the corp who kills it for 1 minute? i can respect that- under the current mechanic, it wouldn't make sense- but i'm arguing also that the wreck should be flagged as owned by both the killed's corporation and the killer's corporation. if that mechanic were to be changed, would you support this proposal?specifically, there is nothing stopping a random passerby from taking your hard-earned loot. the problem is most prevalent in high-sec -where i can kill something, open the wreck immediately, only to find that the loot has already been taken by whoever had a better connection than me. should the people involved in the fight not get first dibs on the loot? (again- we're talking loot, not salvage)"
9/11/2009,under no circumstance i would support it. i just had lots of fun looting wrecks in lowsec from people chasing each around around in a few systems :dthey even tried to shoot me from time to time. speedy punisher for the win^^
9/11/2009,"prime example of why i made this proposal. if the wrecks are abandoned- sure, you're welcome to the loot- but to take from them in the heat of battle when other people are working for it just doesn't make sense."
9/11/2009,well you get the right to shoot me to get your stuff back. must be enough.
9/11/2009,"if its a gang member doing this and not shooting an assigned target, he should be podded and kicked from his corp. if its someone else (neutral), shoot him if your that worried about it, as previously stated."
9/11/2009,"1) i can't shoot him unless it was my corp member's ship that was looted- in other words, if i kill someone, and a random guy loots it, i'm not able to shoot him.2) even if i was able to shoot him, nothing would keep him from docking up, jumpimg out of system, or warping away before i had the chance to shoot him."
9/11/2009,"no.its not your stuff, its npcs stuff and should be free to take for every player instantly. the only issue there is the npc loot is assigned to any player at all."
9/11/2009,/me laughs at tortugan's whine about ninja loot/salvaging
9/11/2009,"god no , too many rules with salvaging / looting allready, the last thing we need is more."
9/11/2009,"ok- but why should the wreck of something i've killed belong to someone else? if you went out hunting and shot a deer, would that deer go to you, or some random homeless guy who comes out of nowhere and grabs it before you can get to it? you'd want to at least be able to shoot the guy for being a douche, wouldn't you? :)"
9/11/2009,"no, it shouldn't belong to someone else, and it doesn't. it belongs to nobody. now, certain kill rights may apply in systems with certain levels of security, but beyond that it's a ""you snooze, you lose"" situation.you can take steps to protect what you see as yours - just realize that the universe is harsh and cruel and if someone gets to ""your"" stuff first, it's up to you to respond. don't expect the game to do your work for you."
9/11/2009,"i'm not going to flame like half the rest of the thread is doing, but i will say that locking the can is not the right solution. the only one i've ever heard that i like is the idea to flag the can to both killer and victim, but that's been brought to ccp and rejected iirc. preventing looting is a bad mechanic. no support."
9/11/2009,"lol @ people who didn't read it and assumed it's a ninja salvage whine.i do not support because i believe loot is first come, first serve. i do however, believe that a thief should be flagged to the person that killed him.if any lag is thrown into the equation, that's called ""ccp fix t3h lagzz!"" and they do seem to be doing a fairly good job with that."
9/11/2009,reasonable. would you consider pairing this flagging with a 1 minute aggression timer during which the looter can't dock/jump?
9/11/2009,"no, because i don't really see the need for aggression just for removing something from a wreck or can. i do support a nerf of intan though."
9/11/2009,"um. no. if anything, all wreck ownership should be removed. looting should be free-for-all, same as salvage."
9/11/2009,"that would be why we see them all the time? come on at least back it up with a little more than a one liner.whats does in own in and why? i don't see it use full in pvp (rook / falcons are way better) and for ratting/missons? well i don't do many, but i cant recall the last time i killed one in a belt, so i don't think it is much used there either."
9/11/2009,"your all young, all ******s and you dont use drones... period.to hell with the hud thing. could be a good idea but its not enough. i say we go with shortcuts. i even want one that i can scratch my ass with. serious. i can get drones back to bay but not out ??? wtf. wheres my scan shortcut ? i want moar moar moar.the hell with the menus inside that drone ui. i want to assign buttons for all my drones to work with and assign shortcuts to it...thats it.p.s: i had a bad traffic day. sorry, your my victim today mwhahap.s: your all young cause for all of you who didn't think of shortcuts you don't know what dos isp.s.s: your all ******s...cause i said so.p.s.s.s: you dont use drones cause if you did you would agree that something as to be done and its not that complicated to fix."
9/11/2009,"an option could be to combine the two ideas, where my original post would be the ""basic"" variant, and the extended/advanced would allow for choosing the number of stacks + the size of each stack..."
9/11/2009,i would definitely like to see a more intuitive mechanic for splitting stacks.
9/11/2009,i'd support this as something for a dev to do if they need a break from a larger project to clear there head to come at it again fresh.
9/11/2009,"you can already add this column to the overview by opening your overview settings. however, i do support adding this as an option to the d-scanner."
9/11/2009,"no, you can display ship type, that says ""raven"". you currently can't display ship class, that would say ""battleship""."
9/11/2009,i wish ccp would dig a hole to put your posts in.
9/11/2009,"your logic is seriously screwed up.you say changing the pos pw is a part of the trick?that assumes someone is in power and responsible for the pw.by that train of thought... that is not an exploit.... that is abuse of power... and that is under the ""metagaming"" mechanic.that means someone put someone in charge of the pos that shouldn't have.course (assuming your even telling the truth to begin with) ccp may think differently but if i was a game admin <and thank god i'm not> i'd have to say the guy responsible is obviously the one controlling the pos.now i could completely be misreading... and that might be... but your words taken literally is a bit hard to misread."
9/11/2009,you understand the mechanic wrong.the ship pilot enters the password. they enter warp. they change the ship password again. creates a bowling effect. the reason you cannot change your ship password inside the tower is to prevent this effect.edited previous post for clarity.
9/11/2009,alright... retracting my previous argument then.
9/11/2009,"so basically the plan here is to use a known pos pw for an insane set of angles, luck, and guessing instead of just mwding at them and bumping them?(e: removed some of the pyramid)"
9/11/2009,"would it be worse if you tossed 30 caps at the problem rather than 1, or a titan? if you do it, if it works, even if it doesn't but you tried it, there needs to be some banning. look at the gm thread, #1 complaint is consistency of rules. this is such a prime example of that argument.bumping is only as good as the bumbers are, and sadly, logoffskis can prevent it. bumping gives the pilots time to react. bowling does not, hence why it was deemed so awful as so many goonies were blissfully ejected from shields and rightly doomsdays so many times in the past. i chuckle at the fact that those same people play the double standard now.insane angles don't matter in the end. tri proved that last night. from twinks battle report not too many ways to make those speeds happen in game."
9/11/2009,"well for what its worth i wasn't talking specifically about the incident this thread seems to be related to since i know almost nothing about it besides whats been posted, was more just trying to make the point that bowling with a known pw doesn't seem like an enormous issue, since you could just as easily use a different and equally effective bumping tactic.the big issue with pos bowling was that you didn't need a password to get people out of what is supposed to be a safe area, as far as i'm concerned if you have come into possession of a pw then it ought to be fair game according to precedents like titans with pw dding inside of the shield.bowling without a known shield password would be a different issue though.just my opinions anyway, not representative of corp/alliance/whatever ofc."
9/11/2009,agreed.
9/11/2009,karma's a *****.
9/11/2009,"it's pretty fun until someone does it to you, huh yaay?cry more."
9/11/2009,"one of the main problems is stolen ideas. although there are very few sci fi mmos out there, it still doesn't prevent other mmo developers from stealing core concepts and tossing them in their games. case in point: blizzard. blizzard steals just about any and every idea other mmos conceive of. they're not good at developing original content, only stealing and improving content from other games."
9/11/2009,i think what you want is to run for csm.
9/11/2009,"ok so ingame at the moment the tempest fleet issue is half shield tanker and half armor tanker it has so much different fits to it that its the most unique faction battleship which is the only reason that people buy the ship. i have bought this ship for its amazing shield tank capabilities but the changes ccp have anounced for it made me go abit green. lets look at the current chang ccp has installed for fleet pest:tempest fleet issue: new slot layout: 8 high, 5 med, 6 low slots, 7 turrets, 4 launchers fittings: 577 cpu, 17050 powergrid dronebay increased by 25m3, bandwidth unchanged speed: +10% max velocity and agility increased by 10%most people will say whats wrong with that?when in reality there is so much wrong with it, first why add extra high slot? i mean id rather have the extra mid than a extra high woundnt you?atm to me it looks like a miniture macherial after the speed nerf big useless but can do great pve. i propose this as a change than the current idea ccp hastempest fleet issue: new slot layout: 8 high, 6 med, 6 low slots, 6 turrets, 2 launchers fittings: 640 (or maybe to 700?) cpu, 17050 powergrid dronebay increased by 25m3, bandwidth unchanged speed: +10% max velocity and agility increased by 10%basicly i gave it +1 med slot - 1 turret slot -2 missles slots and alot more cputhis means the fleet pest still has the option to armor tank or shield tank depending on what the user has trained for, the -1 turret and -2 missile slot gives the ship a balance of 6 guns and 2 missiles to fill that 8 high slots or they could go with 6 guns and 2 nuets/nos or 6 guns and salvages/tractor beams or 4 gun 2 missiles and whatever you want in lows, basicly it keeps loads of ideas going for the mids giving the user and opponent (if used for pvp) thinking about what it might be a shield tanker? armor tanker? full proj with nuets? half proj half missiles rest rr? its endless.it might seem overpowered to most people which i must admit does seem abit to me but might be a good start but in my view the fleet pest only needs a cpu boost to fit a proper shield tank to it :dand oh yea they need to fix projectiles :pflame away :d or give your views on what it should be used for :p (no stupid ideas internet spaceships are serious buisness"
9/11/2009,"or put in other words, don't change anything except speed and agility. well apart from a bit more cpu for versatility's sake. shield tanks are horrendous cpu hogs."
9/11/2009,"so you want to take a ship with more lows than mids, and give it an extra mid as the faction ship bonus slot? that's kind of crazy, really. if you wanted to propose giving the t1 tempest 7 turrets and the faction 8, i might be interested. but this? no."
9/11/2009,"you do know the current fleet tempest is 8/6/6, right? and it's fine as is"
9/11/2009,thank you for that i was at work at time so couldnt commentthe fleet pest will allways have more cpu pgu and other extra bits and pieces you don't relise
9/11/2009,"yeah, i know. always seemed crazy to me."
9/11/2009,"when you launch drones, you have to drop down the ""drones in space"" - uh, widget, for lack of a better word - so you can look at their damage status.however, since there's a little delay between clicking launch drones and them appearing in ""drones in space"", you can't immediately drop down the menu, so you end up waiting two seconds doing nothing instead of activating modules, taking care of range control / overheating, w/e.i'd like to see it dropped down automatically when drones are in space so that as soon as i launch drones i can start worrying about sthing else."
9/11/2009,better drone ui. coming soon to an eve near you............i hope.
9/11/2009,"you can actually expand the folder of drones before you launch them if you want to see their hp in space instantly. i do, however think the drone ui could do with a major redesign and improvement- along with the rest of the ui."
9/11/2009,"you know you can expand that ""widget"" before you launch drones, right? first thing i do when i undock and warp off in a ship with drones. the status quo is fine, i think."
9/11/2009,"im glad its not automatic because my drone interface is close to my mods and will cover them up . id have to re-configure my screen , but im used to it how it is.on a side note: i had wondered if the name ""roland deschaines"" had been taken. i read all the books and used the name in another game .awesome character"
9/11/2009,"""internal"" network address? sure, you can ban 192.168.100.104 from the forums. since it is a non routable address, nothing will happen. the forums never see that address.as others have mentioned, nat, proxies, and dynamic ip addresses all turn this idea into a complete fail. it simply doesn't work. you will wrongly ban more people than intended, and the desired effect will fail for many. other people have tried this in the past, and it simply doesn't work.wouldn't it suck, for example, if your friend came over, jumped on your machine, posted some crap on the forums, and had your ip addressed put on the ban list? hmm, you know, that sounds like a great idea. i'm sure that goonswarm can do something ""creative"" with this. people who support this topic, including the op, simply don't understand how tcp/ip works.i'm sorry that the forums make you feel sad and angry and hurt your feelings, but this isn't a good way of fixing that problem."
9/11/2009,is this really an issue ?do you guys really care if someone who got banned from the forums enables himself to keep posting ?or is this some 'i wanne be forum mod when i grow up' contest ?
9/11/2009,/me applauds anything that will stop isk sellers
9/11/2009,"haha! ahh mate your spelling is pretty bad.... as for the idea, i have allways thought there should be a ship bigger than a bs but still sub cap.......something thats a nice transitional ship from bs to dread. i mean getting to a bs is easy enough, but then from that to a dread is a bit of a wait.also i would love to see t3 assault frigs =d or even t3 battlecruisers! moarrr ships please!"
9/12/2009,"i recently decided i would like to play eve again and re-enabled my account for a month. i attend the local python programmers meet-ups, and every once in a while eve comes up. originally, i played on one of my laptops. sadly, i cannot read any of the text in the game on my current setup. my situation is fairly different from most people, however i have played a lot of mmos and games in general on this setup. this is the only one so far i have had this problem with.my setup is a 60"" hd tv running slightly less than 1920x1080 for overscan reasons. i don't even have this problem with really old games. it's only eve.my vision has been tested previously above normal(20/15). most people have trouble reading things at the distances i can. the eve font is nowhere near legible on my setup.as a developer myself, i am going to call out laziness in the dev team, or possibly graphics content team. this is not a game mechanics need to change complaint, its a ""the interface sucks"" complaint. if people were complaining about something being to hard to do, i could understand the devs ignoring the complaints. i would respect that. however, this issue is a known issue and nothing is being done about it.edit: the only other possibility is the dev team is too small, but if you look at every piece of content ccp has(their site, the eve site, etc.) its all at about 10pt. maybe they just have an idiot designer.i will not continue to pay for something i cannot play. i will be canceling my account, and probably not return. if the devs put a eta on this that isn't too far out within the next 2 weeks i may remain an eve customer, otherwise i am going to voice to anyone who mentions eve about how ccp drops the ball on something so small, but critical."
9/12/2009,"ok i have to add my own request as well. the wife and i have been playing off and on since the beta. we reactivated our old accounts from 2005 just this month, as 12 of us from my website/forum have all gotten together to play, plus my wife and our roommate and a few others. the biggest complaint i have about the game (the only complaint really) is the font size. yeah, we can change the font size in chat, but the ui font are just too darn small. wife and i and roommate all have 1680x1050 22"" widescreens. 12 point expanded font barely makes anything more readable. every single night, all 3 of us, as well as most of our forum friends have eyestrain headaches from trying to read the $#@# font in the ui windows. moving up to 24"" or larger will only make the ui font smaller, which means more headaches. we are all 4-eyed nerds who wear glasses so there's not much more we can do except take a lot of tylenol and limit our playing time. please ccp, you made this game when crt monitors and 1024x768 resolution was the king, but this is 7+ years later and almost everyone now has 19"" or larger widescreen, which means incredibly hard to read tiny font. please, please fix this at some point. please. this is such a great game, and keeps getting better and better. there's a reason why my wife and i have begun playing again for the fifth time since beta. but the font...please."
9/12/2009,"of course your no supposed to use it. where the hell is that written ?are mini supposed to use fusion, are gallente supposed to use iron charges ? are amarr supposed to use radio crystals ?whatever race your flying your supposed to use the best ammo for the situation.your argument here is the bonus is ok because incompetent pilots or inexperienced one will always use it ?it still makes no difference, a level 5 pilot ( using his bonus or not ) has no way to outdamage a level 2 pilot ( who chooses the right ammo ) in 2/3 fights.you conveniantly overlook this everytime you post.fine as long as you apply it fully to all races.gallente get 20% reduction in the kinetic they do from blasters20% reduction to em/exp & kin drones.minmatar get reductions of 20% to the em/kin/therm components of proj ammo.20% reduction to em/therm & kin drones.amarr get 20% reduction to thermal from laser damage.and 20% reduction to therm/kin/exp drones.if your going to penalise non racial damage , do it to all races not just caldari."
9/12/2009,"fully agreed. missiles are missiles after all, they are solid matter, thus would always have a kinetic aspect to them. i think a minimum of 25% kinetic damage would be appropriate. it would keep the ability to change damage types based on engagement, but also enforce a kinetic disposition towards the missile weapon system."
9/12/2009,"dav varan, i think your posts are well thought out and bring a very good point up about missiles.i honestly believe missiles need a buff of some sort. after messing about with tps and webs the other night i was getting into plenty of situations where fitting a web gave more damage than using the tp. it's crazy.the other option is to give some caldari ships bonuses to tp effectiveness. this has the advantage of ewar being useful, but the disadvantage of making a target balloon even more to everyone else shooting at it. perhaps tps could have a hybrid based bonus, say 75% sig radius / 25% tracking bonus of whatever % it currently offers? i suspect splitting it like that would actually lead to slightly more dps for missile users, but the tracking wouldn't help other fleet members. heck, you could also make it scriptable like damps.anyway, i'm blabbering. i support this."
9/12/2009,"who leaves a low resist at default in pvp these days?i don't know anyone who flies without fairly even resists.switching ammo also takes time. often time that you're being shot at and can't shoot back, further hurting dps output. thats without even considering travel time too of the missiles."
9/12/2009,"/signed.this needs looking at ccp.and with some priority, how can you bring in new features when a core feature like sound is broken."
9/12/2009,i am an audiophile
9/12/2009,"sort this out please. maybe down to one second, without the stupid announcement."
9/12/2009,totally support this. give me back that lag that i never noticed because eve was more fun back then.
9/12/2009,2 seconds is way to long for waiting to scan.signed
9/12/2009,/signed
9/12/2009,/signedthis feature is nothing but a nuisance. remove it please ccp.
9/12/2009,"that would be utter win... just saying, but pos's themselves still need to be fixed."
9/12/2009,"[disclaimer: i haven't seen this bought up elsewhere but if it has then oops]as things are, the bracket on your overview and hud for a battleship is the same size as the bracket for a dreadnought or even a titan. for easier identification of capital and supercapital class ships in the heat of battle (its hard to make out those black silhouettes on black backgrounds), could the brackets for these ships be made slightly larger?"
9/12/2009,seems like a sensible suggestion.
9/12/2009,"minor, but sensible."
9/12/2009,i'd be the first one to point out the supercap's sheer size would be enough.but if your in a massive furball of ships in the middle of a warzone... yeah... might help to have a more defined indicator for those classes of ships.supported.
9/12/2009,"yeah, i agree. honestly, i do understand that they painted themselves into a corner, and that it'll be a bear to get out of it. yet, it seems that every suggestion gets things worse. almost like they are over thinking the problem.you know, this is starting to act like they are at the dawn of doing a major re-work on the entire minmatar design philosphy. classically, minmatar have been active shield tankers, and the minmatar specific certificates bear that out.. so, for them to force an armor tank on a fleet tempest is probably indicative that some major mind resets are going on. same with the new fleet typhoon as well as the republic firetail. none of the old rules are being followed by ccp very closely... though what rules they are using seem to be pretty hazy, or hazy from our standpoint."
9/12/2009,"really? no one uses them? flying my muninns, i quite often use the longer ranged faction ammos instead of tremor. the tracking penalty on tremor is prohibitive in my view. i only used tremor when i needed the range it gave. i guess in my mind, a greater chance of tracking the target and hitting was better than a tad more damage if you did hit with tremor. at the higher ranges (100km+), it's less of a problem, but under 100km, i tended to use faction nuclear in the mid-ranges and then, of course, faction phased plasma in the lower ranges."
9/12/2009,got my vote.
9/12/2009,i've always been minmitar and i like this idea. i've got all the base and complementary skills to fly vaga/munin and already fly a maelstrom so i'm definitely ok with some changes.
9/12/2009,supporting this.
9/12/2009,"supported.all the bladedot members need to speak up, and say quite explicitly that ed titan pilot j'rela used this exploit repeatedly."
9/12/2009,"if you decide to put your expensive capitals in a pos that you know is likely to die, you should pay the consequences"
9/12/2009,"also it should be possible for client to detect quitting the game by using ctrl+q or throught the menu opposed to quiting by client crash or losing connection. that would probably lead to exploiting it by killing the eve process or unpugging the net cable, but its still a step forward."
9/12/2009,"indeed, which is one of the reasons why we now are spamming that this needs to be solved. a titan that has literally 20+ bubbles on it should not be able to log on/off enough to magically get out of them, then cyno out. this is broken, and i think deep down, everyone knows it."
9/12/2009,"well, since the idea of the whole emergency warp is to get you out of danger when you log off/disconnect for various reasons and then get you back in that spot when you log in.it isn't supposed to be used as a way to move a ship from spot a to spot b while being effectively invincible."
9/12/2009,seen 2 titans escape from a bubbled down pos using this recently.
9/12/2009,"what really makes this sad is that it shouldn't be so hard to fix: just put a timer on the logout warp. once the game warps-on-disconnection, it wont trigger again for a few minutes. people can still log out, it still offers some protection from disconnects (unless you play on a really bad connection, and if you enter pvp on a bad connection you dont deserve protection), but lametards cant exploit it to make themselves invulnerable. as for the people who exploit this, im not saying we should cut off their genitals and force them to eat the icky bits, but you gotta admit that it would be entertaining."
9/12/2009,"would add flavor, flavor is good"
9/12/2009,add navy carriers to the list
9/12/2009,navy harbinger signing in!
9/12/2009,"yeah, let's have navy bcs, but make then navy versions of the tier 1 bcs, just to **** off the carebears drooling over the thought of cn drakes."
9/12/2009,navy titans navy motherships?
9/12/2009,"and carriers and dreads.or in more words, just that there isn't any doesn't mean that there has to be."
9/12/2009,support
9/12/2009,"why do we play eve ?speaking for myself i would say entertainment.internet spaceships may be serious business.but its ok to ask for something you want as long as its not going to ruin the game.the role they would fill would be the same as the role filled by cnr's etc.a slightly more pimped version of the standard ship for a price.me i want to pimp one out and spin it round in its hangar while going ""oooohhhh..""."
9/12/2009,"i'll support this if there are no more probeable scans as well, balance and all that."
9/12/2009,supported to oppose drake.
9/12/2009,"not sure i understand- if you're saying that probes should no longer be able to probe out those using the directional scanner because of balance, i'd argue that probes actually require a good deal of specialization of skill-training to use, whereas the d-scanner can be used by anyone any time."
9/12/2009,"if you arent moving, it doesnt matter where your ship is pointed towards. so it certainly doesnt decrease allign time."
9/12/2009,"not true. most of alignment time is spent 'aligning' (straightening your ship so it's facing the direction of its warp). getting up to speed is part of align time, but a smaller part than actually aligning for most ships. try it out if you don't believe me :)"
9/12/2009,"well for this to be balanced, you'd have to introduce a new kind of probe. the cloaked probe. much lower scan strength to balance it out."
9/12/2009,"i am utterly amazed and amused by your lack of understanding of this game (and the scanning mechanics).the thing with the old scanning system was that no probes really could overlap each other, and also you had less chance to actually get a good hit on a ship. now the new system.one can deploy 3-8 probes that can overlap to find a ship that is hiding. you do not have to warp to the probing points, but just move the probes to the preferred scanning vantage. depending on skills you can deploy, scan and retract the probes from the designated area within a time frame of 7 seconds. so, the scanning system had a badass buff, we all know that. but, to balance that badass buff, they made it possible to see the probes on the -d- scan. the probes are accually an object (yeah, they are don't argue about it) and we can see object on the -d- scan. and also, a probe is sitting and collecting data (and probably sending out some serious radiation).if you removed the ability to see probes on -d- scan, you're actually promoting highsec (as in, ppl stay there). no, i cannot support a change that only benefit players searching for other players.and uh btw, are you an afk cloaker?"
9/12/2009,"when your ship isnt moving it effectively has no direction it is pointing in. obviously when you are going the other way it takes more time to allign, but when sitting still it doesnt matter at all.but for some weird reason i actually decided to try it out. we have a kronos with ab running (largest ship i had available without clone jumping), so plenty of allign time to keep measurement inacuracy limitted. 1. measured time between hitting button untill i got message ab shut off due to warping, kronos alligned at opposite direction from warp, going <1m/s. took 19.63 seconds before i entered warp2. same measurement, now alligned with <1m/s towards destination, took 19.55 seconds before i entered warpthat difference is well within measurement inacuracy, and i would advice you to try it out yourself too. passive alligning does not work."
9/12/2009,"i disagree!probes in space is the fastest way to get the system in an uproar.i often go into lowsec, throw out a handful of probes, and move on... just to freak out the local mission whores."
9/12/2009,and i thought i am the only one. nice one ;)
9/12/2009,"what a ridiculous suggestion. i agree that the d-scanner is terrible, but what defensive options does your suggestion leave?1: stay perma-aligned. let's hope you weren't mining or gas harvesting (or even need to move in a direction that has nothing to align to in it). also, you are no longer allowed to use short-range ships or actual piloting, because that'll take you out of alignment. and you are provably wrong about direction affecting alignment when stationary.2: dock or safecloak whenever someone enters local. there goes any trace of interactivity between you and other players in lowsec.what do they have in common? they're really boring. if i'm not running highsec l4 missions, then i'm placing the interest and excitement of lowsec life over optimal moneymaking. raising the profits won't matter if you remove the interest.a d-scanner reworking or a more interactive hunter / prey system, i could get behind that. but for your idea, i'm, with this guy:"
9/12/2009,i think i'd rather wee myself than support this proposal.
9/12/2009,what defensive option do you have left? how about actually defending yourself in insecure space? once again- my argument is that insecure space should be buffed to the point where the rewards are worth being in danger of losing your ship.
9/12/2009,mighty big talk from someone who mostly lives in jita it seems. (station hugging for the win?)lowsec and 0.0 is dangerous. but you shouldnt die to any gang passing through.you should have an option to get out. all your talking about alignment doesnt work. neither does every mission allow you to use a pvp fit ship to do them.if the gang has a competent prober they can get the hit before the other guy notices the probes (remember he has to do more work than just spamming scan button). if not ... they might not get the kill.stop fighting in jita. live in 0.0/lowsec before judging this.
9/12/2009,"you're assuming that because i fight in jita currently, that's all i've ever done. i've lived in 0.0 on 3 separate occasions- once in fountain and twice in nc space. i've also been a -10 pirate, and before that, i was a carebear in solitude/syndicate, which is mostly low-sec and 0.0. i've done just about everything there is to do in eve now other than high-scale manufacturing/pos work (though i did have a research pos in solitude at one point). point being, i have plenty of experience in insecure space- and it's a lot of fun. but at the end of the day, it's supposed to be insecure- and i think that given the role of probes to find someone covertly, it makes sense that they should be able to find someone without being found themselves. low-sec/0.0 is supposed to be about risk, and having to fend off pirates- not about how quickly you can spam a button and look for probes. if you don't want to be shot at, you shouldn't be there."
9/12/2009,"absolutely not.you can already get a ship down to one or two scans with combat probes through using the d-scanner before hand to get a very good idea of their location.if you need probes removing entirely from the d-scanner, you're using them wrong."
9/12/2009,i'm surprised to hear that some means of differentiating hardwiring doesn't already exist.
9/12/2009,"definitely supported, just double the required skills (nothing times zero = nothing) and jack up the speed a lot! something like this would be awesome for autopiloting across empire. also, let it fit 8x strip miner ii's but give it 0.0m<U+FFFD> cargohold like the pod."
9/12/2009,"i'd support this if it have a jump drive range of 50 light years, could fit doomsday devices and was immune to webbing and all forms of electronic warfare."
9/12/2009,"you forgot the jump drive that doesn't require a cyno, and takes 0 fuel, with a max jump range for 3000 ly so you can reach those pesky wormhole systems, and the mini doomsday."
9/12/2009,"fsck the titans. ddds are the anti-fun module, and the sooner the ""push butan, receive kms"" is gone, the better. the jump bridge power alone makes them worth having, especially as cyno jammers are about to get massively nerfed.if titans cost 200m isk/day worth of npc tradegoods in upkeep and there were less than a dozen in game, then yes, fine. now that there are hundreds of active titans, they dont get to be that special. there are probably more active titans now than there were dreadnaughts when titans were introduced."
9/12/2009,"i think it's safe to say that we all agree on this one thing: ddd or not, there shouldn't be hundreds of titans around. make them scarse enough and even a ddd is acceptable?if so, there are several options:1: make titans very exclusive through some gameplay mechanic.2: make only the ddds very exclusive (through the same hypothetical gameplay mechanic)3: nerf them to kingdom come (in which case we may need to wonder about what role they will serve)"
9/12/2009,given you lack to give arguments why the ships need work ... funny. anyway.try this one
9/12/2009,"the kronos is the crappiest marauder and is usually outperformed by a simple t2 fit raven, you know?"
9/12/2009,ok i saw kronos rocking in pvp and pve already. can you please explain why you think it is outperformed by raven?
9/12/2009,you're terrible at this game ankwhateveritssaid.
9/12/2009,"i thought that was the vargur?kronos gets the equivalent of 8 blasters, a tanking bonus, the regular 5% damage bonus and a statis web strength bonus.the only downside to it is that being a blaster boat forces it into tackle range.still, the kronos gets 90% web, which on top of the 100% and 5% damage bonus means it will generally blow you into tiny little pieces very quickly."
9/12/2009,vargur rocks for missions with 800mm ac and barrage.there are also some pvp videos involving the vargur and it seems to rock there aswell.
9/12/2009,"it got one more turret than the mega/navy mega, zero over the hype. the 90% web bonus is not awsome(the 99% was in pve with rails and sentrys), it is simply a poor example how much qr gimped other blasterships. vargur is trash for the exact same reason you typed down for the kronos -> ""omg but in pvp."", and ccp decidet to heavy prenerf it. serius how many of this ships are used in pvp, 3%, 2%, 1%, even less?"
9/12/2009,"i think we can all agree that eve is a great platform for organized tournaments. every part of the alliance tournament from the teams' ship combinations and fittings straight down to the maneuvers and actions in the fight itself make for exciting and dramatic matches. there is a lot going on before and during every match and they're almost as much fun to watch as they are to participate in. i've watched a lot of 'e-sports' in my time (lol nerd), and in my experience, an eve match is much more exciting than your average counter-strike match on hltv watching some dude camp a corner with his sniper rifle. unfortunately for us spectators, the only match broadcast with streaming video in the alliance tournament is the finals. for all the other matches, many of which are grudge matches between alliances with a rivalry, we have to be content with audio streams. while the commentators on eve radio do a great job, there is just too much going on to accurately describe in audio. the matches need video to really capture the action, there is just no way around it. i realize there will be some cost involved for ccp to do this, and i would not mind at all if they had to advertise during the matches through banners or even commercials to pay for the streaming, just show us the action! if you'd watch alliance tournament matches over streaming video, support this topic. let's show ccp there is an audience out there."
9/12/2009,this is a pro idea you are the second greatest csm to ever exist
9/12/2009,i certainly miss the live video broadcasts and discussions in between and would like to see them make a return
9/12/2009,"while the idea has been tossed out several times, it once again gets my support."
9/12/2009,"i've been trying to keep up with the tournament but sometimes i just can't stand the announcer and it's really frustrating to not be able to see what's going on.""oh yeah and we lost those two ships a few seconds ago sorry i was busy relaying a story about this one time i was traveling through rancer"""
9/12/2009,"streaming 1 day out of 6 is not enough! there's a lot of drama missed, and it's not exciting to watch the postgame videos after you already know who won."
9/12/2009,i'd watch.
9/12/2009,"i, too, would watch"
9/12/2009,supported!
9/12/2009,yes please
9/12/2009,"i think, from ccp's perspective, advertising isn't going to cover their costs *which was calculated in the millions if the recent eve-radio discussion on this was accurate* so perhaps the right question to ask is: how many players are willing to pay for it?"
9/12/2009,"yes, show it all, many of the lower fights are more intresting."

9/12/2009,"that is one way of getting to see ccp's inner workings up close.who knows, i might do so."
9/12/2009,go ahead and run.. i'll probably vote for drake before i'd vote for you.i'll take my desire for eve to be unique over my desire to know everything they're working on any day. dont want to see some other game try to rush in a feature that ccp told us they were thinking about and screw it up so badly the the playerbase goes completely up in flames to the point that ccp has to drop what might have been a really good idea.
9/12/2009,"well, way i see it, if i ran for csm, it wouldn't matter what i wanted the game to be, i wouldn't be there to convince ccp of my own ideas, but of the playerbase's ideas. that appears to be what the csm is for, from my perspective. they are, after all, the player's representatives. not their own representatives."
9/12/2009,that i didn't expect.
9/12/2009,if the faction was givin all 8 turret slots to proj's then it will basicly be a expensive version of the mael without the bonus to boost amount :p

9/12/2009,"what hacks me off in eve, are people who stay in stations after they've been taken over, and artificially inflate the market. in real life you'd drag them out of their ship, give them a kicking, and throw them out of an airlock. ok, i'm not saying eve is real life (no, really, it's not), but this could be a good use of wis, to be able to forcibly eject someone from a station.z"
9/12/2009,"added linkssmurf, and dear trolls,the csm is a valued partner of ccp in discussing matters of the player base and getting early feedback on design decisions which ccp is about to make. you should keep in mind, though, that this experiment is new and unique in the industry - as such, please allow for some time of accomodation on both sides, ccp and the csm. i mean, look at it this way : ccp is teaming with players, has them sign a non-disclosure agreement, in order to discuss matters long before public press releases ?! you don't want to go full throttle here from the start given the possible damage that can be done. we are only one year down the road, and i can assure you that the csm gets full attention by ccp.as to your complaint about issues not being addressed in this forum : the assembly hall as well as jita park are csm territory, and ccp is relying on us to process them ! this is a sign of trust and not of ignorance. ccp gave that part of the forum to the csm exclusively. if you take some time to read into the available documentation about the csm, you will quickly find the issues which we have and will discuss with ccp in evelopedia's issues in process category. this also lists your gm issue, which even received an extra slot during our iceland face-to-face meetings - and we had the full team of senior gms, including the head of internal affairs, sitting there listening to our complaints. does that answer your question so far ?please read the minutes on the csm-ccp meeting as soon as they are available. they will be linked here on the homepage as well as in the evelopedia.as to the ""issue resolution"" you should bear in mind that csm is an advisor and the final decision, which is also influenced by business constraints the csm is not able to comment on, remains with ccp. the csm does not design the game for ccp. and you should not be so full of yourself to assume that anything any player trolls in the forums gets immediate attention. the channel, which ccp has opened to the players via the csm, is very active and of great importance. the questions and answers feature is further window, which was opened also by initiative of the csm. would you follow the csm minutes you would see a lot of the assembly hall issues are being addressed.a gratifying number of players also uses direct conversation to his and her favourite counselor in order to bring issues to their attention."
9/12/2009,"please read the bolded sentence. it makes no sense. how does the ""aggressor"" have a ""legitimate grievance""?"
9/12/2009,seriously get over your carebear tears. if they dotn attack then why do you care. they are wasting their money. and honestly its not the innitiators fault that noobs will hide in a station and not do anything till you go away. please actually learn the game before you start talking change.
9/12/2009,"if i may ask, what was the process used to prioritize the issues?"
9/12/2009,"we awere all supposed to number them 1-65, 1 as most important, 65 as least. i think only 4 of us managed to actually do it tho. we did get through all the items on the list while in iceland tho, as well as a couple of others that we decided to talk about on the spot."
9/12/2009,so it wasn't directly based on the number of support votes those issues got on the forum or something like that?
9/13/2009,definitely yes. fonts are hard to read on hires displays.
9/13/2009,"being caldari centric you apparently don't realize that tps are the minmatar ew, and a pale shade of ecm anyway. but sure, cladari ships should get bonuses to tps. makes perfect sense with the backstory."
9/13/2009,"my goodness, if the caldari want to swap ecm for tps, please, give it to them. we'll even trade the pure damage types of the caldari for the annoying split damage types we currently have."
9/13/2009,"yes, or they can have gallente damps. but you realize we are talking with people who started making money sooner than everyone else carebearing in their drakes and ospreys, don't train other races for perspective, found some limitations with their racial ships and weapons, but want it all now.an across the board rof bonus for missiles would mean they have no drawback. they would do full damage at any range against any resists. then caldari would get two great ship bonuses. meanwhile amarr get one (because 10% cap use only makes the weapons useable) and matari get one (again because 5% rof makes artys not totally put you to sleep and barely ameliorates the ac fall-off deficiency). the gallente standard 5% hybrid damage bonus is nice on blasters but then they are very short range, and again just makes up for the volley damage deficiency of rails.i cross-trained to caldari, and quite enjoy the drake and rokh in carebearing. and can't beat a rokh for range or ecm boats for ew in pvp. they are appropriate (if not superior) tools for their jobs. but due to perspective do not think the missile ships need any buffs.edit- btw, dav the range ammo argument misses the point that ranged gun ammo loses damage with gaining that range. meawhile a missile does it's full damage at the entire range of its effectiveness which is often longer than gun range. the gun user is losing some benefit of that 5%rof or damage (whatever) for their split damage ammo due to range. the kinetic missile will do it's full damage at the extreme range of the gun which had it's damage bonus subsumed in the range ammo damage reduction. the racial weapons system bonuses are simply different, and either all should have drawbacks or none. a 5% rof on missiles does not have any drawbacks, and as i said would mean caldari would get two wholly beneficial bonuses while everyone else would get one compensatory and one beneficial bonus. that is not balance."
9/13/2009,"no one is asking for 2 damage bonuses, just asking for 1 damage bonus instead of the kin bonus.cmb's get compensatory bonuses as well , i am not asking for these to be changed.for instance,cara currently gets 1 damage bonus ( 5% kin ) and 1 compensatory ( missile speed ).omen gets 1 damage ( 5% damage ) and 1 compensatory ( cap usage ).after the change cara would have 1 damage ( 5% rof ) and 1 compensatory ( missile speed ).missile systems have drawbacks / gun systems have drawbacks all fine and good.what dont have drawbacks are the damage bonuses.5% rof is ~5% more dps in any given situation for any weapons system5% damage is 5% more dps in any given situation for any weapons system.the 5% kin bonus has the drawback that it only gets applied to one type of ammuntion that can be fired, it gets lost if different types are used.^^ this is very true , it is not currently the case. hence this post."
9/13/2009,"yes lets destroy the whole caldari racial history of kinetic damage and add another nerf to gallente ships, whom are already very underpowered in comparison to caldari and amarr. caldari are fine as it is, any problem with caldari comes from 'miss'iles."
9/13/2009,bad mkayyy !!!

9/13/2009,nopurely on the basis i never want to see a caldari navy drake in this game.tier 1 bc's?maybe.
9/13/2009,"because in a pve situation, ""defending yourself"" is a mug's game--the attacker has all the advantages, even down to what damage type to use on you, and npc's who'll help them out due to moronic ai. don't forget exploration sites are not deadspace any more, so dropping a decloaker by the warp-in point doesn't work.perhaps if i compromise my ability to run the site or mission, i may stand a fighting chance against one enemy. and as we know, pirates are honorable sorts who will always fight one on one, like gentlemen. if tackled by competent attackers, the mission runner or explorer is going to die sooner or later. so all defence in lowsec focuses on getting out of the danger area the second a hostile appears on the overview, or sooner.here's what i suggest you do--make or support a seperate ""buff lowsec"" thread, because that's a cause i can get behind. when that is implemented, then start this thread again. i think a lot more people will support a lowsec buff alone than when it's mixed up with another proposal. you're trying to argue for two different things at once and only confusing your own message."
9/13/2009,"i will keep this short and simple.when someone swears on the forums, instead of turning it into a ****, turn it into a ""*smurf*"".this serves many purposes, two of which are posts being funnier, and people no longer being able to guess what swear word was said because it doesn't say how many letters are in the word now.ex. someone on the forums says ""what the {insert f___ word here}?"" (the forums would censor it as ""what the ****?""the new system would censor it as ""what the *smurf*"""

9/13/2009,"considering the labor of trying to determine the status of a target i vote we introduce a mouseover that gives us a percentage of the target's status.chiefly, pos shields. it's a pita to know how close the shields are to reinforced since we can't see total or remaining hp. you can mouse over crystals to see their damage while they're loaded, why then can we not hover the pointer over a target and see the percentages of remaining shield/armor/hull?seems like a pretty simple introduction that will make things loads easier."
9/13/2009,a simple solution for you: lock the ship!
9/13/2009,"the first one does. second and third? they kill a lot more.and you did kinda write off almost every sub-battleship ship class there, but that's all right, since doomsdays do the same thing in play. sucks if you want to help your alliance and can't afford a triple-trimarked sniper bs, but them's the breaks, right?"
9/13/2009,"get your titan today at titans 'r' us 9.99 exclusive offerno seriously the game is heading to this, burn them."
9/13/2009,"what if the only way to own a titan is to be donated one by the empires if you win the alliance tournament, meaning that there are going to be very few of them around?"
9/13/2009,"root titan in place for 3-5 minutes after ddaying, unable to warp or jump, keep the aoe damage."
9/13/2009,"well that would suck donkey balls as this is supposed to be a sandbox game and 0.0 is where the players make all the rules. i would much rather see a system where palyers can make as much ships as they can afford and use them as they please, within the games mechanics ofcourse. balance the titans any way you want as long as such hard limits aren't put into the game.regardless it is irrelevant at this time, since there already are hundreds of them. did you plan on leaving the existing ones in the game like t2 bpos and just stop any new ones from being created? maybe steal the current ones from their rightful owners? there just aren't good ways to roll back the clock on titans, so they should be redesigned so their destructive power doesn't get so overpowered with just a few additional titans at your disposal. the situation is bad now and will only get worse, so some change needs to happen.if someone wants to add some anti-blog weapons, provide something that the little guys have access too, since they are the ones that are going to need it the most. having anti-blob weapons being mainly the sole property of large blobs never made any sense to me."
9/13/2009,"well... topic name says pretty much everything i guess. my argument is quite simple: if we can repair our damaged modules with nanite paste why can't we do it with drones?actually there's no way to fully repair your damaged drones while you're in space and nearest station you'll be able to dock is 15jumps away. in my opinion it's very unfair to drones! they want to be repairable too!but seriously, having healthy drones instead damaged ones can decide on victory or not. especially if you're using boat relaying more on drones than guns/missiles.it would need few changes to drones interface, but not that big right? it needs to have added some healtbars for drones inside the bay, or at least info if its damaged or not and rmb-on-drone click option for repairing with nanite paste.how do you think? imo it would be very lovely little addon."
9/13/2009,"except nanite paste repairs modules not shields, armor or hull and that is all drones have. there are also remote repair systems, that allow you to repair drones now.someone proposed a way that would allow you to slowly repair drones in your dronebay. it would allow drone maintenance without allowing you to repair them effectively during a battle. something like that would be a much better idea than this. a module or rig or something, so you would have to make a sacrifice to gain the ability."
9/13/2009,"it is called remote armor repairer. have one fitted offline on one of your ships. i know asking to fit a remote hull repairer is a bit too much. but well.oh and armor maintenance bots ;)not supported. you already have an option to repair your drones. for roams you want to have some kind of remote repair in your fleet anyway, use it."
9/13/2009,support! personally i missed the detail about them not being live broadcast. *sigh* i really wanted to see that iac vs aaa game live!

9/13/2009,"much as i think it'd be kind of cool, there's a reason that they stopped doing this, and it was almost certainly money. i don't think they're going to reverse themselves on it just because we think it'd be cool - they probably think it'd be cool too, but they can't justify it. if drama is your concern, wait for the youtube(it only takes a few hours) and avoid the coverage until then."

9/13/2009,i like the idea and in my eyes it should be executed as a box you can tick to activate a second stack number textbox to keep it nice and simple.

9/13/2009,"actually, it happened to me, and i don't recall doing it to anyone.but, for what it's worth, i found it pretty funny!"
9/13/2009,"put simply, the purpose of the csm is to make it so that the devs don't have to wade through all the idiots on the forums(/me points upthread) to find out what players want. they hold an election, find nine folks to represent a good cross-section of players, and get them to filter out the bad ideas and raise the good ones."
9/13/2009,"funny thing, those ships have existed for close to two years now. look at the skill reqs on t2 battleships - marauders give you the reqs for siege modules, black ops give you all the fancy jump skills, and both get you bs 5. if you train the pair, and have the support skills to use them properly, you're one long skill(asc 5) off dreads."
9/13/2009,"no, that gets the issues to csm, who then vote on whether to take it to ccp or not."
9/13/2009,"well, that makes sense."
9/14/2009,"in this forum, any eve player can raise an issue for debate.the best and most supported of these issue threads are picked up by the csm for debate. the issues that pass debate are bought to ccp, and if ccp consents, the issues get implemented into the game.how it works:in order to raise an issue, simply create a new thread. in the title write a brief description and in the body, give as many details about your idea as possible. any person replying to the thread can check a box to show support for the issue, which provides at-a-glance on the thread listing how supported an idea is. if a csm member wants to raise an issue in a meeting, they are only allowed to select issues arising from threads in the assembly hall, and only threads that are at least a week old.when a csm member selects the issue, they must create a page in the eve wiki, condensing all the forum input into a solid idea that can then be voted upon.out of all the issues that pass, the csm brings them to ccp, who removes all the issues that are moot, and talks with the csm about the remainder. at this point, a relevant employee in ccp is assigned the issue and asked to do some research on it- is it feasible? is it a good idea? such answers are found and returned to the csm during the csm-ccp meetings online and in iceland. issues that pass are added to ccp's ""backlog""- that is, their to-do list for implementation in the game.how can i get involved?by simply raising issues in the assembly hall. try not to raise issues that are repeats of old ones. if you are in doubt, use eve-search.com and search the assembly hall forum for similar threads. also search the eve wiki(link at bottom) to see if it has already been raised by the csm, and what became of it.if you support an issue, be sure to reply in a thread and check the box giving support. you don't even have to say anything in your response if you don't want to. this helps the csm because we can better see at a glance what issues are the most supported by the player base.if you want to give feedback on an issue, try to make your feedback as constructive as possible. don't say ""your idea is stupid"". tell them why their idea is stupid. the assembly hall is more then just a complaint box. we can use this forum to make the game better for everybody, so let's try to keep discussion as constructive as possible.4th(current) csm links. for links to information for the 3rd and previous csms, please see my post just below this:list of all issues raised by the csm4list of all issues raised by the csm ever.issues that have passed through the csm and are waiting for a response from ccpif you are interested in finding out what happened during a specific meeting, go to the jita park speakers corner. there is a forum thread created for every meeting.edit: more information on the csm! see my next post in this thread. this post is full."

9/14/2009,"if you let your race, which can shoot from any range, and always hit, even if it is a small amount of damage, get this bonus then you must give the other races bonuses too.right now gallente only deal thermal and kinetic damage. arguably drones do ""all types of damage so it's not fair"". but look at drones, i think the most damage you can get from drones is 475 dps or so, and that's with thermal drones. so that point is moot. also saying that you can use iron and lead and **** doesn't mean anything since they are longer range (we have to switch ammo just to shoot at the same ranges you guys do without having to switch ammo...), but less damage. still same 2 types of damage. effectively we only have a bonus to thermal and kinetic.minmatar can deal all sorts of damage, but with damage drawbacks for switching around. i think they also get drawbacks for range? i'm not sure about this, but minmatar has not so stellar dps, which makes up for their damage spread.amarr can only deal em and thermal. kinda like gallente. they only get a bonus to em and thermal, since they can't shoot other types. and don't even have the option to shoot explosive or kinetic damage.caldari can hit anything up to your missile range, yes, it may be a small amount if you're shooting at the wrong ship size, too fast etc. every other race has to deal with tracking and range problems with smaller ships that they shouldn't be shooting at.caldari can also pick and damage type to shoot with no apparent drawback. you just get bonus to kinetic. you are not missing out on damage for thermal, em, and explosive missiles, you are getting bonused for kinetic."
9/14/2009,"picking this one out as it illustrates perfectly where your idea went wrong.you'd first need to make all the minmatar t1 ammo base damages the same, like they are for missiles. (and while you do that, also remove all the range penalties, and change them to ""pure"" damage types.)as it stands, minmatar already get a penalty for switching damage types, you have to go with lower base damage if you want another damage type, which makes damage type selection pretty much impossible apart from rf emp / rf pp / barrage.again, understand that kinetic is the caldari racial damage type, and hence they get a bonus to that. being able to switch damage type without penalty is too powerful a feature, thats why no race (including minmatar) gets it.also, missiles are missiles, not turrets, and not drones. turrets (apart from projectiles with serious drawbacks) cant switch damage types at all, drones can be destroyed and cant change their damage type on-the-fly."
9/14/2009,"the penalty for projectile to switch damage type is built into the ammo, not the race. if missiles had the same damage output as they do now, but with 25% of the damage being kinetic, it would be an acceptable tradeoff to changing damage types imo."
9/14/2009,"consoles are pretty toys. but internets spaceships are serious business.btw, bioshock was an impressive interactive piece of concept art with a fairly nice plotline. however, it sucked as a fps. it also sucked as a series of interesting choices. dumbing down always has its downsides."

9/14/2009,"i was thinking about my factional warfare experiences, and more often than not, a fleet is a big blob that fires at anything with a red star on it, with a few tacklers and scouts in it. organising the fleet in a more strategic way is virtually impossible when working with a randomly collected army, unless the tactics have been pre-made.i was thinking of american football as an example, they have attack/defense strategies memorized and each person knows what to do. if a fleet commander in eve could load a battle-plan where the program automatically looks for ships fitted to fill in the required roles and show primary and secondary target on the fleet member's huds then an unorganised blob with only one tactic turns into a more organised blob with multiple possible tactics. this might make blob warfare more interesting. the battle-plan program would ofcourse also work on smaller gangs, but they are much easier to organise to begin with, so the gain isn't as much as with a blob.idealy the battle-plan program could identify enemy ship-types on the field and assign targets according to the tactic specified by the fleet commander. this could be as simple as choosing to eliminate certain ship-types first, but could also be more elaborate, where ships with ecm are automatically told via the hud to jam specific targets while logistics ships are told to repair specific friendly targets via the same system. the hud target assignment being the most important part of the system, second being that the fleet commander can execute complex tactics more efficiently."

9/14/2009,"empire pos warfare it is a complete logistical nightmare to try and take down a large pos in empire space, simply because the cost of resources and the amount of time it takes. i propose 1 of 2 things happen:a) remove the ability to anchor large towers in empire space. research monkies use them to anchor 10+ labs. there is no reason why they cannot use a mixture of medium and small pos's to get the same job done. this will require large pos's to be located in either 0.0 or lowsec, and vunerable to a capital fleet.orb) introduce a mini-dread that can enter highsec designed to do more that bs damage, yet less than dread damage. this will discourage people from using them on a day to day basis in lowsec and 0.0, but allow more options when sieging pos's. they could be t2 tier 3 battleship hulls that get a damage bonus when deployed, yet their tracking is so low they cant hit anything that is moving, similar to how current dreads work.both options are very good, but i am sure they are full of holes and flaws. these are just general ideas and suggestions.-saithe"

9/14/2009,"overhaul the corporation/alliance wardec system-----------------------------------------------the current wardec system works, however there are some major flaws in it. i have been reading around other ideas, and have written up this post of proposed ideas i would like to present for discussion, and hopefully csm/dev recgonition.1) corps can jump into and out of alliance to dodge a wardec. currently, if a corp is wardec'd and joins an alliance, the wardec carries over to the alliance. i believe that it should follow the corp solely for the duration that the dec was paid for. after that, its either the alliance or nothing. a corp can also leave an alliance that is wardec'd to dodge it. i believe that the wardec should follow the abandoning corp for the duration that the dec was paid for, then its up to the corp/alliance that made the initial wardec to dec a particular corp that jumped out of the alliance or not.there has been alot of discussion that i have seen where people believe that if a corp leaves an alliance that is decced, then both parties are able to shoot the corp. this would not be right, as the alliance that the corp has left has not paid for a wardec on the leaving corp.2) active wardecs currently, anyone is free to dec anyone, and retract any war they please, whenever they want, provide they make the payment. i propose a few ideas:a) if 2 corperations are involved with a wardec, and a corperations pos gets sieged somewhere, the wardec cannot be retracted until the pos comes out of reinforced unless the wardec gets invalidated by concord due to non-payment. this would prevent people from watching their pos get steamrolled to reinforced, only to retract the wardec and laugh at the assaulters. a possible flaw i see in this is someone going around and sieging pos's just to keep the dec going, however this can be easily identified, and ccp can void the wardec as per exploit terms.b) when a corporation makes a wardec mutual that was placed upon them by anther corporation, and the corporation that placed the initial wardec tries to retract it, then the option to pay for the wardec should fall immediately to the corporation that made the wardec mutual. there should be a 6 hour timer or so on this, something short to disallow exploitation, yet enough time so that someone cannot try to sneak it through without a director on.another option to wardecs would be a little trickier, however provides a more fluid motion in easily getting surrender terms. this would be the current contract system, and is explained as follows:corp a wants to dec b.they set up a declaration of war (the costs being the same as they are currently) with requirements of surrender detailed (as we can currently do with an item exchange contract). the duration of the contract is 1 week.once corp b fulfills the terms of the contract (be it isk or items) the war comes to an end in 1 hour. if b does not fulfill the terms of the contract in the 7 day contract period a can simply extend the contract, or change it (altering a war declaration contract can only be made during the 24 hour termination period at the end of the contract duration) with a mouseclick and payment.corp a can allow the contract to end and the war terminates 24 hours later.corp a can retract the contract at any time, ending the war in 1 hour.if the contract is made mutual by the declared corporation (an option available within the first 24 hour period of the contract before the war goes live) the contract timer halts until the mutual agreement is terminated by the declared entity. once the mutual status is terminated the timer resumes until the end of its natural duration.only the declared party can establish or rescind mutual war status.(more to post, ran out of space)"
9/14/2009,"if a tower is put into reinforced during the war and would come out of reinforced only after the war ends it's 'active state' is retained. i.e. if it's at war with a when it goes into reinforced then it retains war status for 4 hours once it comes out of reinforced mode... irregardless of war status. if it is engaged the target corp has full license to return fire per aggression rules.(thank you icarus starkiller for this input.)i would greatly appricate as much feedback as possible on all these ideas. rip them apart, tell me how they suck. then tell me how they can work, how to make them better. the wardec system desperately needs an overhaul, almost more than the current sov system that is being worked on.-saitheco-exec heretic nation.p.s. i really hate this 5 minute timer crap. really bad."

9/14/2009,uh... issac? he was stating a fact... not a proposal.and it is... a fact.
9/14/2009,better idea: remove the censorship altogether. i thought the eve community was supposed to be mature.
9/14/2009,"i have some ideas i would like to propose about solo mining. yes i know there are multiple comments out there about how people are 'supposed' to be in groups, or other lame things that i'm 'supposed' to be do with others, because this is an mmo. (sorry, but mmo means that there are other players around, not that i have to always be in a group... if i wanted that - i would go play ff11.) i don't see on the mining ships any way to be able to take on any player pirate ships, especially without a significant loss of mining ability. so how about some mining pvp options then? or at least giving dedicated miners a chance to fight back. ideas: 1: jet can mining is dangerous - another play can take all the stuff from it, or just destroy it. so why can i put in something in it, like a largesmart bomb, loose 10k m3 space, and if another player pops my can, it'll trigger the smart bomb(s) to go off too. (yes i might get hurt... i might not, it may or may not destroy them... but i'm willing to take that chance. i also might not be able to toss out another jet-can for an hour... an acceptable trade off too imo.) 1a: there are multiple ways to go for counters, and then to counter those. would be fun to slowly have this escalate. (hacking to try and get around, anchoring to prevent it, etc.) 2: if a direct increase for giant can doesn't happen, how about some can's that you can have either be secure or anchor: (either you can protect it, by not letting them have access to your minerals, or they can get in, but not take the can itself. 3: a bounty system that works on can flippers. ok; player pirate flips my can, and i don't have skills/ships that i can take against their brutix/thorax/megathron... fine - can i pay a fee to somebody to take my kill right on them and have a designated party go after them? (and offer a bonus if they actually can prove they killed them? ) 3a: how about being able to pay concord 5 mil to go after somebody for can flipping. but with that they'll go slowly... and only if the pirate gets in their face; 15 mil - concord will actually make an attempt to shoot them down... 50 mil - concord'll go ape on them and the timer stops if the pirate hides in a station. i'm sure other people have other idea's, but i'd like to see some options to be able to go after somebody while i'm in a mining barge (or exhumer) or at least give them some retribution.)"
9/14/2009,1: not supportedget an hauler alt or get an orca like everyone else.however... i've always wondered how much fun it would be to employ a booby trap system for things like cans and ships and other things.wrong password - kaboom!2: lol... no... get an orca3: no... bribing concord to do your bidding would result in exploitation.no offense but uh... as a seasoned/experinced miner... this is not an issue.and mining solo is not as profitable as doing so as a group... if you refuse to go there... don't expect it to get any easier.

9/14/2009,"the issue is that the titans themselves are fairly balanced ship. the fear of the titans though are overpowering and people tend to fear engaging their fleets because of titans.not engaging fleets is bad. it leads to less pew pew, less fun, and general unchanging situations in 0.0.so the titan will be changed. if it's made a remote ecm burst sort of thing... it'll just be plain sad.if it can just keep hitting dd and pwning subcaps. with something like a 30second or 1min cycle. that'd be nerfy but fun. you might see titans in subcap battles. with dreaded fear of capfleets. as any of those subcaps could cyno, and you get bubbled anytime.if it can pwn 1 dread per hour cycle. then titans will hit and run or at least try for capfleets. which will be awesome because it speeds up the death of capitals. which is also good.ultimately those last 2 changes lead to soooo much more destruction and death that it'll be grate fun."

9/14/2009,(does some ratting)(suddenly forgets how to fly her dramiel)
9/14/2009,-50% damage taken from sentry guns. for each and every pirate faction ship.
9/14/2009,shouldn't that be +50%? i mean since the gunners would be out to shoot pirates more than other people? that being their job and all?and faction navy ships should get the same bonus.
9/14/2009,nah -50% would make far more sense.pirate scientists have spents years developing electonic warfare stratergies to reduce the impact of empire sentry guns on there ships.teh bonus would only be of use to people using pirate ships to do pirate things.having thought about it for just one moment admittedley maybepirate frigs -75% sentry damage.pirate crusier -50% sentry damage.pirate bs -25% sentry damage.every pirate ship would be guaranteed a unique role in game.

9/14/2009,"so yes, you may know me, i'm a terrible pirate.but last night, i had a wonderful eve dream, and i brought it up in the hellcats channel, where it was suggested that i post it here. in my dream the faction warfare had sucked the empires' resources, all the furthest systems had fallen to lowsec status, making it very hard to find a high-sec route into another empire's space. most routes required at least 1 system of lowsec to be traversed. former low-sec was now called ""fallen empire"" and was unconquerable 0.0 space, given over to pirates and other lowlifes. there were missions there too, some of them for pirate factions, or local warlords, some of them for the navy of the empire that used to own the system. most stations were in the hands of local power-mongers with little care for any empire, you could pay money and modules and minerals to the station owners to get access to the services of their station. if you paid them enough cash, or otherwise gained their favor (by for example, accepting a bounty-hunt mission from them) the station's guns would no longer fire on you, as they were your buddies. there were also random navy npc spawns, little fleets with interceptors, covert ops and battleships, representing the empires' attempts to get their space back in check. they would hunt pirate players, sometimes chasing them through several systems until the pirate managed to lose them. should you marshal a pirate fleet and kill them, they sometimes would drop navy faction modules (which makes sense, doesn't it?)so there you go, that was my wonderful dream last night.then i woke up, logged in, and was promptly shot at by gateguns >_<"

9/15/2009,"the vast amount of replys are not from a vast amount of people , probably half the posts in this thread are by me i can only support this topic once. 30% of the rest have been from a few other people who have brought forward half arguments that try to turn this thread into a discussion about the pro and cons of different weapons systems and flattly refuse to look at the value of the bonuses which is what this thread is about.drake ? there are 17 ships affected this isnt about drakes."
9/15/2009,"there is a necessity for game balance.the consequences of achiving game balance is a better game imo with more variety and option for players to utilise.if you consider cmb's to be resonable balanced compared to other ships then obviosley you will be of the opinion that i am trying to make a fuss about nothing.if you consider cmb's to be out of balance then you might consider supporting this boost cmb's through better bonuses thread.people are used to the idea that the kinetic bonus is there to give caldari the kinetic flavour.what most dont stop to consider is the value of this bonus compared to rof/damage and how it adversely affects ship balance.believe me when i say that if i thought cmb's were balanced , however much i dislike the kin bonus i would not have bothered starting this thread.for the first 3 years that i played this game i flew mostly cmb's , i never liked the kin bonus but i never complained about it either mostly due to the facts.1. missile were a lot better in the past before the nerfs they have recived.2. i had little experience of guns to compare them too.since i have now cross trained to projectiles i have come to appriciate the woeful current nature of missiles.i found myself doing more dps with t1 projectiles with skills mostly at level 3 than i ever did with missiles even with maxed out skill in missiles.look at the line up of cmb's can you point to just one ship and say it is best in its class for pvp especially solo ?taking the 12 combat orientated vessels i would be of the following opinion.caracal: best in class vexorcerberus: best in class vagabondhawk: best in class ishkurkestrel : best in class incursusdrake : best in class hurricanenighhawk : best in class absolution/astartephoenix : best in class rev/moroscondor : best in class atrononyx: best in class broadswordcrow: best in class taranisrook: best in class curseleviathan : best in class avatar/erebusi dont have huge experience or evidence to look at forgila,caracal navy issue,wormbut i somewhat suspect phantasm,vexor navy issue,succubusif missiles boats are balanced correctly with gun boats then it is reasonable to expect that at least 3 of those ships would be best in class just by pure mathematics.15/(four races) = 3.75. round that down to get 3.this would be done by ccp if the issue gets raised by the csm.the best i can do is point to evidence.1) do minmatar constantly complain about caldari doing op damage against there kinetic hole ? ( missiles get 25% dps against mini t2 )!2) is the raven an overpowered battleship ( short or long range ) ? ( raven has rof bonus )!3) is the sac an overpowered shortrange vessel ? ( sac has r.o.f. and damage bonus to heavy assault )!!i find myself saying no,no and no to the above, which is why i draw the conclusion that rof and damage bonuses would not overpower cmb's but would be just the boost they need to bring them up to par compared with there class equivs.if kinetic flavour is important for cmb's then it should be applied through the ammunition as is the case with other races. haveing the kin flavour on the ammo does not cause the issues stated in the op."

9/15/2009,will you give me your support if i do what you ask and the facts bear out my opinion ?
9/15/2009,"convince me. my opinions based on limited experience are:best hac is zealot, cerberus is second. no boost needed.hawk's problems result from fittings and roflckets rather than kinetic bonus.frigates - compare tiers correctly, also roflckets.drake is best bc. no boost needed.nighthawk's problem is pg and crappy slot layout, rather than kinetic bonus.caracal - very difficult to compare with other cruisers, when the caracal is so much stronger in gang. still viable solo though.phoenix's problem is delayed missile damage in large cap fleets, rather than kinetic bonus. this isn't fixable, though, so rainbow damage bonus may be appropriate, particularly given the absence of capital cruise and a khanid counterpart.hics: dps is not their concern.recons: rook, and it doesn't have kin bonus anywayinties: taranis is not really comparable with other interceptors.titan: loli really think you're overstating the significance of the kinetic-only bonus. many ships have much more pressing problems than fiddling with the kin bonus - hawk fittings, roflckets, nh powergrid."

9/15/2009,"without going into the pros and cons of the logoffski thing, this argument brings up a valid side note and potential solution:let supercaps dock. and take out the e-warp mechanics for all ships.some of you are going to cry foul on the supercap docking thing i know, but think about it. you can have an unlimited number or dreads, carriers, freighters etc dock in the same station and no problem. while supercaps (titans especially) are the size of a dozen or so dreads, nothing stops a 50-ship strong cap fleet from docking at once. there are even modules already in game that can store supercaps.so my suggestion: allow all stations a certain amount of space for ships to dock. make that number big enough that one or two supercaps can dock (though presumably to the exclusion of space for many other ships in that station). and allow, as ccp is apparently considering, multiple stations in 0.0 space systems.you could still camp the station hosting the titan of course. it might allow the supercap pilot more time to wait you out, but it would also stop a number of e-warp abuses."

9/15/2009,so you basically prove that your suggestion is not needed.thank you! now lets move on to something else.
9/15/2009,no.
9/15/2009,"current large pos in empire would be allowed to remain, but if taken down or destroyed cannot be erected again.check, agreed. after besieging a large pos with nothing more than bs i 100% gree.i disagree with this option.instead, introduce a siege (and triage) module for battleships. same requirements as capital siege mods dumbed down a little for bs use. essentially does the same thing for bs guns as they do for capital guns. this will vastly increase the dps needed to engage large pos, lock the besieging vessel in place, and cut it's ability to engage sub-capital ships dramatically (even missiles would have to be adjusted in siege mode to do little or nothing against a bs sitting dead still).the siege module would not increase the battleship's defense values so it'd be a sitting duck if the pos rallies defenders or they lack the logistics to handle concentrated pos gun fire. triage modules would increase the logistics/defense capabilities of the bs using it as currently enjoyed by carriers, but extends the range of remote logistics to a comperable range (20-40km, tops).either could be fit on any battleship."
9/15/2009,"they are overhauling pos entirely,so this issue is moot"
9/15/2009,why would you limit that? large towers *are* supposed to be hard to take down.furthermore it is often easier to anchor one large tower and have multiple labs on it than having to keep the corp standing up so you can anchor more smaller towers to anchor more towers when the demand grows.*facepalms* no. those should be limited to cap ships. you already got logistic cruisers with a rep power that largely exceeds the a single bs.and for more dps fit more damage mods.may i ask did you siege that tower with like 10 people that you bring up such a cry out on this? 40-50 people nuke the tower into reinforce in like 20-30minutes.maybe a bit longer with hardeners on the tower.
9/15/2009,the fight began with 20+ bs and several bcs.after 8 hours the average number of pilots was 13 bs and a couple smaller ships.the hostile corp onlined 9 shield hardeners. after pulling it out of reinforced they anchored 18 in total. it has zero guns and 30 ecm arrays.a dread fleet of 20 would have difficulty cracking a nut like this in 0.0 even though none of them would be destroyed by the pos itself.i argued against this proposal when it was discussed but after wasting a day pounding on the stupid thing i am more than inclined to agree. large pos are simply untenable for a mere battleship fleet to engage in empire. there are not many corps that can willy nilly dedicate a fifty man heavy fleet to a single attack that would take hours of pointlessness.smalls and mediums are still plenty tough and can deal with the average fleet of bs in empire if managed with any care at all. a single pos gunner can near destroy a bs in a salvo or two of small pos guns.as some other rube in assembly hall was whining about capital ships in empire... too much ehp to 'suicide gank'... large pos simply have far too much ehp in the face of anything sub-capital to be allowed into empire.couple that with 36 hour reinforcement timers and war-deck dodging renders them almost entirely unassailable.a little insider information here?they said they were changing 0.0 soverignty dynamics. nothing was said about changing poss.
9/15/2009,hehe resistor pos. :dthey are even pain in 0.0 ;)but well. a well defended pos should be hard to kill. you got competent enemies there. be happy about it.but not every pos in highsec is like that.

9/15/2009,"we already have a strong, dynamic, and very functional contract system. porting the war declaration process over to this exact system (or a separate war declaration contract system) should not be a terribly difficult task.this will establish terms of surrender that the declaring corporation can put in place (yes, the terms can be pointlessly out of reach if the declaring party chooses make them so). the declared party should also be able to place their own counter-conditions that the declaring party can meet to end the war prior to the end of the war period (counter-conditions render 'contract termination' closed for the declaring party - they either have to see the contract period through or meet their target's terms of surrender)once the terms are met (by either party) the war ends almost immediately (1 hour) so that the surrendering party can get back to their normal operations in a timely manner and begin repairing the damage they've suffered.if the terms of surrender are met the declaring party cannot choose to not accept them, it is a function of the contract and as such is a binding agreement.also, if the one party surrenders the victorious party cannot re-initiate another war contract for a period of time (7 days to a month or some other feasibly logical period). other parties are not prevented from declaring war, however.this would go a very long way toward making wars more (for lack of a better term) functional and logical.additionally:as saithe said, leaving an alliance should not end the period of war for the exiting party unless the declaring party chooses to let them end the war. exiting an alliance during a war creates a sub-contract that can be modified by both the declaring and exiting party to establish their own terms of surrender, ending the war in the aforementioned 1 hour period once met.furthermore, war flags all members of the declared corporation the moment the contract is issued (before it goes live), and that flag is retained if they exit their corporation. they can freely join other corporations and their war status does not carry over to the new corporation. the war flagged target can be assisted by their new corporation, without concord intercession, should that pilot come under attack, with the attendant aggression rules currently in place."
9/15/2009,"yes replying on an alt, ok now that's out of the way.you seem to have missed all the real issues what about jita pvpers docking as soon as the alliance they dec'd arrives. what about the exploit of using neutral logistics.i would propose the following: war aggression would generate a 15 minute aggression timers during which time you would not be able to dockjita, rens and other key trader hubs would not be included in the wars, targets could be engaged anywhere else but camping jita 4-4 undock would not be allowed. logistics repping ships engaged in hostile acts will be concorded unless they themselves have an active war dec against the target shipthoughts?"
9/15/2009,"please, stop that ""peace and love in jita"" stuff right now.if so, people will never leave jita.and this isn't the game we want eve to be.just... think about it during 2 seconds.i agree that the agression mechanics are a bit broken, but your idea is so bad i don't even want to take the time needed to list all the reasons why.i'm sure a couple of forum trolls here will do it for me after reading your idea."
9/15/2009,true your ideas sucks and its bad....vewy bad. we should wardec your corp just because you thought about this.but anyway. i guess thats your price to pay to wardec an alliance that doesn't want to fight or a corp that doesn't want to fight. there probably in high sec or something. come join the big boys down in nullsec and wardec of those guys. i'm pretty sure they be happy to kick your ass if you wardec'em...if you got the balls in the first place. not all pvp'ers like this cause wardeccing an entity in nullsec is usually a bad idea...they shoot back...they shoot back big time
9/15/2009,"i'd like to support some of the ideas put forth in this thread.1) if an alliance is wardec'd, leaving the alliance should cancel the wardec for that corp (please keep reading, i explain). the reason for this is because wardeccing the alliance could be a valid tactic to try to break up the alliance. the wardeccers may want this.however, if a corp itself is wardec'd, then the corp should continue wardec'd regardless of joining or leaving the alliance.2) i like the contract ideas for wardecs. makes these like treaties. however, any contract as far as a war goes should be optional. for example, you may place terms in the contract. valid terms may be corp x leaves the alliance, the alliance pays us x amount of isk, we kill x number of ships in the alliance, etc. however, even if these contract terms are fulfilled, the deccing alliance will have to go into the contract and accept and cancel the war. (or have an auto-accept option that cancels the war immediately (within an hour) if the terms are reached.)the reason for this is we wouldn't want to mess with the current system, which mirrors real wars in a good way in some ways, where even if two sides agree to the treaty you can still break your treaty. that's just my opinion, though. either way, some kind of treaty or contracts for wars would be nice. didn't the devs mention something about fully functional treaties in the blog? maybe they could touch war decs, too."
9/15/2009,"additionally, they need to fix mutual wars so that both parties have to agree on terms of surrender before the war can end."
9/15/2009,all the highsec capital ships are in violation of the rules.rules here:3. you may not use your capital ships attributes to gain any sort of advantage over other players while in high security space.an attribute of capital ships is a massive amount of ehp. which literally cannot be suicide ganked. no other ship in highsec is capable of this. undocking in a capital ship is a violation of this rule as it uses the capital ship's attribute of high ehp to become immune to suicide ganking.
9/15/2009,/me screams with nigh hysterical laughter at the pirate/suicide ganker sob thread
9/15/2009,accusations that i am a hacker or exploiter is quite inappropriate.as the implication that i am a pirate or suicide ganker with a sec status of 5.9 suggests thus.
9/15/2009,"yeah, pretty much this. those capital ships in high security space are there because ccp allowed them to stay. if they thought ehp was a problem, my guess is they wouldn't have done that.if ""i can't suicide gank them"" is your best argument, you'd do better to have this thread locked now, before the flaming gets out of hand."
9/15/2009,"hahaha i never accused you of hacking or exploiting, how silly of you.and if you aren't a suicide ganker or pirate, i can't understand what is possessing you to whine about how hard it is to suicide gank capital ships."
9/15/2009,chribba didn't want that veldspar anyway.
9/15/2009,the hell are you going on about now?did you even read the bloody thread you quoted? ccp spoke on the matter.the matter is closed.suicide ganking? jason... stop playing russian rollete with your brain when it comes to ideas... its not healthy.reporting for crossposting/contradicting gm.

9/15/2009,woah... ninja delete.:)i was gonna point out that he's spamming the same unimaginative post all over the place :pnoob.
9/15/2009,well i dunno where storefront went. how about apply this terrible system to corp hangars where the system wouldnt be totally busted.corps could set it possible for people to see what is in the corp hangar. the person then does the sort of create contract storefront buy orders of what they want. then directors with proper roles could accept buy order and give out those items. which makes it possible for newbs to get fitted ships out of the corp hangar. get out there faster and get into the pew pew.
9/15/2009,"not sure but they once talked about this last year if i remember right. but the patch didn't get this feature out. so my guess is that they'll probably wait for walking in stations for this to happen first. probably so we can have a las vegas commercial district style. well, something very flashy everywhere. they were suppose to release manufacturing of named items as well on the same patch last year but they didn't do that.i hate them ...just for thatbut on your thing, yeah, i support it cause contract last for 2 days and i didn't see any way to put an order for corp members only"
9/15/2009,pirates could have good standings to certain factions aswell. do antipirates get the same kind of bounty?
9/15/2009,"not supported.a: concord doesn't pay bounties for killing player pirates. as bounties are created by players in the first place.b: the bounty system is flawed and doesn't work in the first place which negates point a doubly so.c: not all players can be killed in high sec unless the standings for sec rating is below -5 and even then most pirates won't be flying in high sec with that kind of rating for a obvious reason.until you resolve the above... your proposal is one sided and encourages greifing on a grand scale without counter balancing the system.if you want to get paid to kill positive sec rated pilots with very bad standings to factions in game then we should get paid to kill you folks likewise from concord or empire factions as well for breaking the ""law"" if you will.a ying yang affect is what we need to achieve here."
9/15/2009,what a ridiculous idea. no.
9/15/2009,so what you're saying is that shooting your friends should make you both large sums of free money? no.
9/15/2009,not supporting this because all your doing is whining over not getting paid for criminal actions.until you acknowledge that people who are targeted get fair shot at said bounties by ai's and not players... don't expect anyone to support this. (except those who greif and gripe over not getting isk)
9/15/2009,*looool* poor you!
9/15/2009,well.. think of it this way red....how would you feel if carebears could get paid bounties for blowing up anyone with a negative standing towards concord regardless of bounties? as in an additional bounty paid out by concord even with 0 isk bounty placed on anyones head?the only obvious thing that would happen is you guys would be going after each other by the time your bounties got high enough... and then when do they stop issuing bounties?you got a ton of holes in your proposal.it's vastly unbalanced.... and has a serious lack of foresight.
9/15/2009,there's a reason players don't have bounties like rats. its because then players will just sit around in shuttles or t1 frigates or free rookie ships and mutually kill each other back and forth for massive profit.
9/15/2009,finally.. someone caught on to the elephant in the room.:)
9/15/2009,not supported.
9/15/2009,"you know, i'm going to go on a bit of a limb here. i think the idea has more merit than people are giving with their straw man defense. if it were done in such a fashion so as to only reward bounties to people who have aggression flag against a pirate faction (ie missioning or ratting in lowsec) and was done as a dirivative from how much the person had in bounties on the reward period factored against the ship the person killing the rats was flying, it could be workable.just to give a hypothetical, unmathematically sound example:johnny 101 is ratting in tama, and has collected 14 mil in rat bounties in the last 14 minutes while in a caracal, redsplat comes and pops johnny's caracal.now, johnny has a -7 standings to guristas, and is flying a cruiser, therein guristas would reward redsplat 0.7x(14,000,000/4)= 2,450,000. not a huge sum of money, but enough to give a small enough incentive to cover repair costs, and still prevent abuse of the system."
9/15/2009,if.... if i was going to support this... without a counterbalance... i would only allow it in low sec and 0.0not high sec.because we (us high sec folk even tho im moving to whs) have no defense against this.
9/15/2009,"i think it'd have to be implemented in everywhere save wh space, simply because, from a practicality perspective:player a) is killing guristasplayer b) kills player a either: saving guristas or avenging fallen ones.in either case, if the person gets themselves flagged, is at war, etc. it doesn't change, and miners worried about rewarding suicide gankers should remember that the average belt spawn would make any reward pitiful in highsec"
9/15/2009,i can see it now... tens of thousands of petitions for getting ganked without concord.really you seriously can't be that dense!
9/15/2009,you just lost respect points for ignoring the obvious.
9/15/2009,pirates should get a fraction of the ship's value as a reward for the kill.this does 2 things:1. its no longer profitable to buy cheap ships and farm your alts.2. makes piracy and counter piracy a little more viable as a career.would be even better if we got a fraction of the total insurance. if someone has had a ship for a long time and has had multiple insurance contracts the killer(s) would get multiples of said bounty.i should contrast this proposal from the op and say that i don't really see the point in making this npc based as pvpers generally don't have high or low standings with any npc corp. makingit npc standings based just makes it more of a pick on carebears thing.
9/15/2009,it's worse than that... all i can see happening is an endless supply of isk for killing various ships without restraint.i mean ive killed so many angel cartel rats in high sec they practically have me at -10 for all intents and purposes... i don't particularly like going into hyper-paranoia mode because im a potential isk cash cow while flying my maelstrom or an orca or an hulk.take that and multiply it by the population of jita... sudden smart bombings even with getting concord'd (or not) would get things totally out of control.as ive said before... the idea is intriguing... but leaves open a gaping can of worms.lack of foresight and counter-balancing is not a welcome thing when it comes to changing the systemeven the smallest thing has a major impact in eve.
9/15/2009,"even if the stupid thing is ship type based. people will just kill each other in their rookie ships. get the bounty and then they get their free rookie ships when they dock, this system rewards players for engaging in zero risk activitiespilot a: hey man, we both have really crappy standings with (insert pirate corp name), lets get in really cheap t1 frigs and blow each other uppilot b: ok, i'll start.*pilot b blows up pilot a, receiving bounty*pilot a: ok, let me go dock so i can get my free rookie ship.*pilot a docks and gets his free rookie ship*pilot a: my turn!*pilot a blows up pilot b and gets a bounty. pilot b then docks and gets his own new rookie ship*(wash and repeat for hours)oh, and it'd be a cool new way for isk sellers and rmt traders to macro make isk on trial accounts. brilliant idea."

9/16/2009,i support this product.
9/16/2009,"the problem with this is simple, as i posted earlier in this thread as well:the other t2 ships, with the exception of the equally underwhelming eas, get a total of *5* bonuses if you count their resistances that way. af get 4. so, counting resistances does not make the problem go away.--krum"
9/16/2009,"situationas it stands currently carrier and mothership pilots only have two choices when it comes down to repairing their drones and fighters. either they deploy all drones and start repairing them with repair systems (remote rep or repair drones) or they go into a station and repair them there. not even to mention trying to repair hull damage in space.to me it seems odd that carriers are not equipped with an installation on board which can repair their drones without putting them into a dangerous situation or forcing the carrier to be dependant on a station installation. especially since carriers are mobile logistical bases but the designers somehow forgot to put in a maintenance bay.main proposalgive the carrier class ships the ability to repair their drones when they are docked inside the ship. however this ability should not be able to compete with the remote repairing abilities provided by the carriers capital remote repairing systems. the repair should be slow so that it is most effectively used after a large battle when the carrier is out of the heat.this is primarily aimed at drones taking hull damage as many people will not have a capital hull repair system and carriers are supposed to be mobiles bases which provide logistical support and not dependent on stations.tl;drgive carriers the ability to repair docked drones.extra ideas formed in topic- maintenance deck to which you move your drones for reparation (should not add extra capacity)- some kind of fuel usage for repairing (revised to make it more balanced)- faster repair rate to motherships- have an active triage mod unlock a faster repair mode making this option viable in combat.- have the option to use a faster repair mode at all times on the mothership however make this consume fuel as well, make it as effective as a normal carrier repairing drones in triage but make it use much more fuel due to the lack of the triage mod (revised since motherships changed)- possibilities of new skills related to the maintenance deck."
9/16/2009,motherships maybe. carriers no.
9/16/2009,why should supercarriers be the only ones with this ability?
9/16/2009,they cant dock and it would give them another strong point to field them.
9/16/2009,"this is like saying you can launch aircraft from a modern aircraft carrier, but you can't fix them when they come back damaged.i support this. maybe give motherships a boost (like 100%) to the repair rate over normal carriers (representing more adavanced and comprehensive repair facilities - or even just additional warm bodies able to perform repairs at the same time), but they should both have it.supported."
9/16/2009,give carriers this ability only when they are in triage. dunno about the supercarriers :)

9/16/2009,"i think something needs to be done about this.a game mechanic was put into place on purpose (get key, activate gate, key goes away, you run the complex and take your chance at death or glory)problem is some people find ways around this. keys are harvested and folks get into an instance that you got the key for, or they sit there for hours in the last room/spawn location/whatever and wait.this is not everquest, or wow, this shouldn't be.the solution is simple, at least to me..make the keys expire after a set amount of time.i'm not sure what can be done about folks camping the last room of a complex... maybe have the complex shoot peeps out when the spawns happen like a pos forcefield, and do it far enough that they can't warp back in?i'm just throwing out ideas, but somethin' should be done.-skan"
9/16/2009,"supporting investigation of this issue. the hilarious solution would be to make stronger and stronger guys spawn the longer you stay in a plex- so at some point your af has to kill a fleet of 10 bs in that 2/10 plex, which only despawn if you leave ;d (not actually suggesting that- but it would be hilarious!)"
9/16/2009,and then i let it spawn such big rats and wait cloaked until someone else warps in and gets toasted. besides most af can easily speed tank rats.profit!;)
9/16/2009,"plex keys have the effect of making plexers invincible. unless someone can come up with an earth shattering observation in the remainder of this thread, i'm going to raise this as a csm issue."
9/16/2009,if your going to make keys expire after a certain amount of time... then make them reuseable within that time period.reasoning : some players go in and get the crap kicked out of im or they can't salvage or whatever.plex's being one way turn me off : o p
9/16/2009,"oh, and, making keys expire is probably not going to happen because they will have to code in a new feature for it.removing keys altogether and making the gate usable when the boss in the current room is currently dead, or some repeatedly achievable objective that doesn't lock out the next guy, is probably a better idea."
9/16/2009,"so i just read the new dev blog pretty impressed by the new ""super carrier"" which as long as ccp lets them dock and make them cheaper seems good.then i read this.wait what nerf the moros why?the moros is currently the weakest dread fielded in today's cap fleet as the nag got a boost to it's tanking with it's extra mid slot.it's only benefits are that it can be use as a station dread for hitting station camping ships (which i might add requires a complete refit from your normal dread fit).also that it has the highest dps of all dreads on paper.however this is not true as gun tracking in siege is so lame you get light hits on a tower even though you are within optimal and at 0.0m/s (seriously ccp fix that already) and that drones cannot hit over 60km without rigs and the high slot module. so in normal siege encounters where you are at about 150km range from the other dreads drones will be useless.i want a serious answer ccp what crackpot came up with the idea that another drone ship needs a nerf fix the crap in the game rather than ships that don't need fixing, if you add this into the next game people will quit and the moros will be never be use again as it will be next to useless.gg ccp well done for being moronic.</rant>as you can see not happy with that one change, the rest is good.*edit*good new everybody they kinda listened then stopped then turned around and laughed...so as per my post in the thread this is just another kick in the teeth."

9/16/2009,actually it's 30 seconds and the problem is those 30 seconds you are invulnerable due to the nature of the abuse.
9/16/2009,"that solution solves no problem, lol. it just makes their new warp point take longer to make. plus you don't need a new solution the emergency warp is designed great, it's just bugged. we need to make that distinction people. i feel that emergency warp is there for really when the player is logging back in. for the people with the slower connections they won't be having their ship appear in space before they can control it. the emergency warp gives you time to log back in while your ship is already ""known"" to the server.the bug is a new destination is created if you log out during the emergency warp. the solution would be to check ""was this person in emergency warp when he logged out? if so, don't change destination, else change destination point."
9/16/2009,"i propose to boost ,at the minimum, carrier drone control range, because it's ridiculous that an ishtar can control drones further away than a carrier class ship which main purpose is logistics/droneboat. currently maximum control range for non-fighter drones is 60kmin other words. give carrier either a static bonus or per level one.50%-75% control range - static bonus ( boosts control range to 90-105km )10%-15% control range per level of carrier - leveled bonus ( basically the same )for the upcoming 'nerf' of moros. this would be great for moros to have static control range bonus as well ( or even all dreads )"
9/16/2009,"i support the looking into of this issue- not sure if you're solution would be the best option, but it's certainly sensible :)"

9/16/2009,it seems this idea is well supported. what happens now? just let it sit here and hope that a developer reads this and gets inspired? i am pretty new to the process here. any suggestions on how to move this idea forward will be appreciated.

9/16/2009,"this is a tolerated exploit, works perfect for bots, super caps and everything else. i totaly support what your thinkin. it is cheating, can show you picks from selfmade emergency warping super caps out of dictor bubbles.in general i wouldnt replay here, but i just had it again. raven unlockable in belt due the selfmade emergency warp feature ;) but hey luckily he warped another one in before he ctlr-q 4 other ravens =p, was somehow to emo and forgot to do a selfmade emergency warp.ya your right you cant get killed in empire lowsec and 0.0 with a passive logout. you can break camps in wardec situation in whatever ship you are. cause the fekin aggressor doesnt even get a lock on this ship. no question about emergency warping. but a selfmade one is just gay. still have fraps lurkin around from selfmade ewarps away from 3 pointer npcs slowboating out of my dictor bubble somewhere in 0.0 hammering tha button to get a lock on his ship but you know it is not possible meanwhile do the selfmade ewarp feature he lost aggro from the ratz instalock on me ;). stories over stories...dont know: my whine whine conversation with devs ended with the feelin like: you ****in ...it easy to change, it is ploitin and glitchin like in other games.codin isnt ccps best one you know =p"

9/16/2009,already been raised!i believe ccp intends to implement this
9/16/2009,"i like icarus's idea of the ability to fit a siege or triage to the battleships, and having them affect the ship just like they do the dread/carrier. alternatively, make them 'smaller' to not give as much a damage bonus/tracking penalty or as give as much bonus to rep range/cycle time."
9/16/2009,we took down a large shadow two days ago. you just have to have the right equipment in place with the right people on station. the funniest thing happened while we were repairing the mods and weaponry to take with us. a local in a bestower showed up and tried to time the unanchoring so he could take the mods.. so three of our pilots got in their very fast ships and played bounce the bestower.. it was hilarious.i laughed so hard i almost peed my pants.. i have never seen a bestower do 3k m/s before..
9/16/2009,you had been nice to the guy. noir just suicide ganked everyone who tried it :)
9/16/2009,"ok, now let me ask you something? how long did it take you to plan this? how long did it take for you to put the pos into reinforced? how many members did you have shooting it? how long did it take to get everyone on at that time to start shooting it?i am not trying to argue that taking down a large pos can or cannot be done. if i had the time (and patience) i could take down a large pos by myself, solo. thats not what i am arguing for or against. i am trying to suggest alternate means of pos warfare for empire space to give everyone an equal chance to take on large towers in empire space, and not just lowsec.we all know theres 1 person in a corp that would love to sit at a large pos in a dread in lowsec and siege the **** out of it, running the risk of getting hot dropped. lets allow the same thing to happen in empire space, only with a new flavor of battleship. it would make things more interesting, and i am sure a fleet of 50 battleships will be cheaper and cost less than a fleet of 10 of these new mini dreads/carriers."
9/16/2009,"what you really miss... do you have the slightest clue how much work it is to maintain a large tower? (i dont mean such failure as yours in bosboger.)a large tower *is* supposed to be work for both sides. maintaining and killing. if you want to kill it faster bring more ships. if the challenge is too big for you. leave the pos alone. the others win. if you really want it gone you can also try to keep them from fueling the tower.anyway. still not supported. the more you post, the more it looks like whining because you had to work for something."
9/16/2009,"i feel that (field) command ships need a boost at the moment there is no real reason to use them over battleships. the reason for this is that active tanks currently are no way near as effective as ehp tanks. only the abso and nighthawk are viable ehp ships. another flaw with commandships is that pretty much everyone is packing a neut of some type these days which is not good for commandships, especially when trying to take on battleships. a possible fix for commandships could be to reduce the effectivness of neuts on them but on a size scale so battleships using heavy neuts wouldnt be able to neut or not very well be able to neut. this would still enable frigates and cruisers to neut commandships making for some epic killmails or what ever. i think that commandships should be brought to the attention of the csm as they require a bit of a boost."
9/16/2009,"nightmare is a commandship?i like the bonuses from commandships. a few gang links can help a gang quite a lot. not to mention vulture/damnation as baits.especially field command ships are meant to be tough nuts to break, so a fc can sit in them and survive through out the fight."
9/16/2009,"heh, allways mix those two up, i think you got fleet and field commandships mixed though. still there really isn't that much of a reason to fly a cs over a battleship which will do the job (other then bonuses etc) they are still much too flimsy in the current nature of pvp and everyoen fitting neuts in spare slots."
9/16/2009,either your doing it wrong (likely)or you have never seen a command ship in action (propperly) (very likely)not supporting.
9/16/2009,"(i have) never seen a command ship in action no, please tell me what i am doing wrong. sleipnir and astarte can not ehp tank that well while still doing dps and with an active tank setup one heavy neut can end them."
9/16/2009,i have... the minmatar one in fact.... and they do a beuatiful job in there own right.i've also recall seeing a pair winning a round in the alliance tournament some time back.. also minmatar variant.i don't think command ships are used in solo fights... they tend to be used in groups or gangs.feel free to correct me those who know better that is.i think you should do a bit of research before you push your proposal any further at this point.
9/16/2009,"well. most commandships should have enough buffer to burn back to the gate and de-aggress. and imho the gang link bonus is the reason to bring the commandship. (no matter if fleet or field commandship). if you dont want to bring it for the bonuses, you still have more agility and speed or just bring a bs if you feel better. but they definitely got their role. i dont see a need for a buff."

9/16/2009,lets keep this topic alive! the war dec system needs fixed badly!
9/16/2009,"this isn't about peace and love in jita it's about lame ass ""war dec'ers"" who never leave jita (or rens) stay within docking range and dock as soon as the ""alliance or corp"" they dec'd turns up for a fight. we all know who i mean!you are right that empire pvp is broken but there are many ways it is broken not least of these being a belief that sitting at 4-4 undock ganking people who haven't loaded can in anyway be called pvp.the reason i suggest banning camping in these systems is to promote roaming pvp you know like everyone does in low sec and 0.0 now surely that is a good thing and provides a natural progression into low-sec and even 0.0"
9/16/2009,"but what it would actually do is make these areas a safe place, and/or move the camping/ganking to another area (there's only so many ways into jita).in eve a war is meant to not be safe anywhere. if people ""abuse"" it and war dec people in jita to try to get legal ganks, you could appropriately not go to jita, or find a way around them, or haul with backup. if you make it not worth it, perhaps they will avoid decing you and your corp in the future."
9/16/2009,"screw that. if the lame ass wardeccers are not leaving jita (and other market hubs) then they are not somewhere else. theyre not in the alternate hubs. we all know who you are talking about here, privaqueers. they wardec any alliance thats bloated and large, and rich. they are simply there looking for the ******s that undock their shiny expensive ships and getting the easy kill so they dont have to do any work whatsoever. ever notice how fast the scatter when you show in in 3 or 4 numbers to fight them? hell, i scared 14 of them off when i was in curse alliance 2 years ago in a crow. a lone crow scared off 14 privaqueers. if they wardec you, and you fight back, they will think again about deccing you a second time."
9/16/2009,no. the only real war dec i've ever seen is the ******ed one man corp who war decs an entire alliance and demands 20 million a week to leave them alone. dodging war decs by leaving an alliance seems like a perfectly valid tactic to me. i think war dec griefing by people who never undock maybe should be addressed first.
9/16/2009,goes both ways.greifers who war dec to just to greif and kill for no other reason than to kill... force those who don't know how to fight back let alone could never win to never undock.this is a 2 way street... hence why you don't see me participating in these discussions as so much... because both sides of this age old argument... frankly... suck ass.and until i can say something constructive... i don't want to beat the horse to dust as it's already long sense dead and broken.

9/17/2009,"to be fair, there is nothing missing just a few things that could do with updating, (such as why some items were turned down by ccp) i just wanted to see if a csm member would put the time and :effort: into looking and updateing. after all, whats the point in a wiki if the main people (csm/ccp) don't update it with all the information, it is the csm part of the wiki afterall.its one thing to make a nice thread and get glue applied, it's another to keep what that thread links to uptodate, i wasted my time into looking for an answer that should have been included within the wiki when the data was entered, it was not, and as you correctly stated i'm bloody-minded enough to point out that all the nice formatted threads in the world mean jack if they point to incomplete data.i'll await a visit from the internet spelling police again.. yawn."
9/17/2009,"good points, well-made. there's a difference between the :effort: of keeping things up to date as events unfold and fixing an omission where somebody says ""it's wrong, find the error that i won't tell you about and correct it"". nonetheless, your cautious pessmism that it will turn into yet another incomplete thing on the internet.can it be incomplete and still useful? yes. the csm part of the wiki has been useful to me, in satisfying my curiosity about certain issues if nothing more. mazz's sticky is well constructed and, even though 90% of idiots always ignore stickies on forums, will probably help keep the assembly hall more organised. even if it is polluted by idiots like me going off at a tangent.i'd have capitalised the initial ""to"", omitted the 'e' from ""updateing"", inserted a space into ""afterall"", and hyphenated ""uptodate"".i put more effort into the things that i'm good at and do for free than the ones that i'm paid for. this is probably an unwise long-term strategy."

9/17/2009,"i'd support this implementation only if the drones in the maintenance deck cannot be launched directly into space. otherwise, you're just increasing the drone bay size.so you would need a right click > move to maint bay, and a right click > move to drone/fighter bay.and in this case, the supercarrier bonus becomes obvious - it gets a bigger maintenance bay so it can repair more drones/fighters at once."
9/17/2009,"supported. nothing as dumb as the scoop/relaunch as drone shields used to be, but a slow passive repair feature would be very useful."

9/17/2009,"i'm going to say it, like i promised i would:let's remove csm term limits!okay, it isn't going to be that simple. we need protections against jerkwads who are popular online but get no work done within the csm, but in the long term we're going to need continuity along with fresh ideas. so i propose three simple changes that should fix this problem and i will follow it up with my reasoning~1. remove the 2 term limit. instead, no more than 4 incumbents are allowed on the csm at any time. incumbent is defined as someone who has already served the 2 terms and is running again. what this rule will mean is that when it comes time to tally the votes, if more then 4 incumbents are on the csm, the 4 qualifying incumbents with the highest votes may stay and the rest are disqualified from both csm and alt status.2. upon application, for all incumbent applicants, ccp should look closely at the past contributions and decide whether or not it's worth paying for all the airfare to get them to iceland. ccp can arbitrarily deny any incumbent's application if they think that their contribution to the csm will not be worth the financial cost.3. partial terms(such as when a csm has to drop out and an alt steps up to take their place) do not count towards the term limit if the partial term did not include the csm iceland summit where the majority of the csm's work is done. specifically, this will mean that this half-term does not count towards issler's max.so anyways here are my reasonings:1. a significant portion of the csm are people elected by the same voting blocs(goons, goons, northern coalition, specific eve forums, pandemic legion + renters + the girl vote.......). preventing the same individual from stepping up means the voting bloc will choose someone else to represent their interests, so partially removing the rule as proposed will not necessarily cause a huge change. in the long term continuity is going to be important, because the 2-term rule essentially means the csm will eternally be filled with csm noobs and anyone really qualified to serve is disqualified after only two terms.also, because of rule #2, i do not think that this change will result in abuse.2. the csm is basically consultant work for ccp. their payment is the free trip to iceland and all they stuff they buy you, and you need to submit satisfactory work in return.3. i don't think what is happening with regards to issler's situation is fair.(for those not in the know, issler has already served once and was an alt this term before she was bumped up to full csm status, after the very important iceland csm summit. so she's riding out the lame-duck end of this term and it currently means she can no longer get elected)"
9/17/2009,"the t1 and t2 ships in eve have fixed slot numbers.thats so boring and an expert pilot know what can do against this ship. i have an idea for change this.would be create 2 modules.ship body augmentor (mid slot module) (passive module)device upgrade augmentor (low slot module) (passive module)ship body augmentor could be add to ship one low slot.device upgrade augmentor could be add to ship one mid slot.result: ship lost a mid slot because fitted module but gets a low slot or vica-versa. one single module useable on ship only simultaneously.skill requirement: ship body augmentor: mechanic lvl5, hull upgrades lvl5, (1x rank 1 skill and 1x rank 2 skill)device upgrade augmentor: mechanic lvl5, engeenering lvl5, electonics lvl5 (3x rank 1 skill)(cant use if the ship reach the maximum 8 module slots in same row, like low or mid )"

9/17/2009,"great idea. why add new ships when this could allow new variations of fittings on all the old ones.and while they are at it, why are scrams and webs mid slot items (and not high slot)? they are weapons are they not? - and nos and neut are (correctly) highs... major permanent shield tank nerf there. shield tank ships generally do not have as many mid slots as armor tankers have lows already."
9/17/2009,"i support the idea, not the implementation.better would be is if were a rig that exchanged a med for low, or low for med. and also had drawbacks. say -10% velocity from med->low or -10% cap recharge from low->med"
9/17/2009,this is a better idea than the op's and fits within the current game mechanics tbqh.
9/17/2009,this should be restricted to t3. you want to modify your ship? get a strategic cruiser.
9/17/2009,"no, this is not true.this shift make just a small flexibility on ship and you can't change the all attribute of ships as t3.you can change just a 1 slot, not all."
9/17/2009,"i agree, but i think these widgets should work like rigs, in the sense that they'll be destroyed if you remove them, and they don't drop if you destroy the ship, but still be fitted in the mid or low slot. and actually, i don't feel a low should be possible to convert to mid. only downgrade, and only one step at a time, i.e:high -> mid - checkmid -> low - checkhigh -> mid -> low - check (using 2 modules)mid -> high - faillow -> mid - failand there should be a limit to how many of these widgets you could use on one single ship. maybe two or three./supporting the general idea, but with some modifications."
9/17/2009,i like this idea better than the op. this feels like a more natural fit of how rigs work.
9/17/2009,"i must be missing something...but how do the keys make someone invincable?oh, and being able to re-use them on the same instance would be nice so you can go salv, cuz you don't always have an alt or buddy to come with.-skan"
9/17/2009,"what if plexes simply move?after the plex is devoid of npc rats, it moves to another location in the system, and the player ships are left behind, forced to start the plex from scratch."
9/17/2009,that works too.-skan
9/17/2009,"have people able to hack the gates and gain entry without a key- using the codebreaker module and the hacking skill.anyone hacking their way into a plex gets no bounty for killing rats and there is no possibility of any loot drops for them.in short, the only reason to hack your way in is to kill that sob hiding in the plex."
9/17/2009,"yeah, 'tis a silly system."
9/17/2009,"the problem isn't the mode of entry, it is the fact that you can harvest keys, and camp the last room.camping items should not be a profession.there are folks around where i fly that have it timed down to the minute.the only time anyone else gets a chance is if there is a random dt.-skan"
9/17/2009,"if plexes move around and have to be scanned down again, there is no more problem, right?"
9/17/2009,"sybilla prior, i don't think anyone disagreed with you..-skan"
9/17/2009,"the moros has became a unique ship class of it's own. people trained all the way up to gallente dread to be able to use it in that role. they invested lot's of skillpoints. and there's no real reason for this nerf, i don't see any complaints on the forums. there is no real reason to nerf it and frustrate all that moros pilots, especially those that use this ship not in it's dreadnought role. the nerf is a mistake, i hope ccp will reconsider it and leave the moros as it is."
9/17/2009,"gallente dreadnought skill bonus:5% bonus to capital hybrid turret damage50% bonus to drone damage and hitpoints per skill level in siege mode<U+043E><U+043A>, <U+043E><U+043A>...minmatar dreadnought skill bonus:7.5% bonus to capital projectile damage per level7.5% bonus to capital projectile rate of fire per level in siege mode =)caldari dreadnought skill bonus:5% bonus to kinetic missile damage5% bonus to capital launcher rate of fire per skill level in siege mode =)amarr dreadnought skill bonus:10% reduction in capital energy turret capacitor use5% bonus to capital energy turret rate of fire per skill level in siege modetold aionstar. and yes that's right.this is a discrimination against gallentes.and more one thing no problem with moros, the problem is the 30-60 sec redock time at station when someone got criminal or shoting something.change that to 15 mins like the global flag, and end of station hugin and starting new era, where the pilots need to fight and not just hiding in cloak or redock.this is the problem, but ccp dont want to fix this sh*ts."
9/17/2009,"ok that's pretty encouraging.failing that, evemon shows a mere 95 days for my gallante capital alt to respec to amarr, so v0varchon > thanatos anyway."
9/17/2009,"the change wasn't really called for, and current moros specs are as if drones are considered a capital weapon on it. this is the same as the dual-weapon system on naglfar. drones don't even come close though, dps/range wise, unless they also introduce some new type of siege/dread drones, and boost drone control range for drones."
9/17/2009,just train amarr
9/17/2009,fixed that for you
9/17/2009,"all the dreads have been weak at times. lasers used to do next to nothing, torps used to do **** to moving target (less so now), don't even ask about the nag. time for the moros."
9/17/2009,"i agree ccp needs to fix how hybrid turrets don't hit, or as hard as other weapons used by other races. fix this problem and the drone bonus while in siege only, will be a non issue. implement the siege change without fixing hybrids and you are screwing every moros flying character in game. the problem with that is they spent at least 6 months to a year of focused training to get into the ship, and to turn their hard work into rubbish would be a slap in the nuts by ccp."
9/17/2009,"supercaps should be a major risk. eve always has had a risk vs reward system, and the risk of a super cap is that it can be camped into its home starbase, that starbase could run out of fuel, or could be destroyed. making a supercap dockyard strikes me as removing the risk from an inherently risky 60 bil investment.ed has weaseled their last titan out of danger. fix this now ccp. and also, move an avatar and an erebus into cl-1 planet 5 moon 12 and make sure it has no fuel in its fuel bay and can't move.and is officer fitted. screw you ed for being ****s and not taking your titan losses like men."
9/17/2009,and give carebears yet another reason to not go into low sec / 0.0?no. they have too many reasons to stay in high sec as it is.
9/17/2009,"not supported, because think to me just an another cloaker idiotism, who don't want to see him on local.firt we need a mechanism which enable catching of the cloakers with a specialised shipclass or module."
9/17/2009,oh my. what would the goons do without somewhere to spam? heaven forbid that we not receive that garbage.
9/17/2009,no. scanner needs some serious fixing first.
9/17/2009,"no. this has been suggested many times, and is shot down every time."
9/17/2009,"no, nyet, nein, negative, not on my watch, etc."
9/17/2009,"i would like for people to watch market trackers for the basic construction components of all rigs. typically that means:tripped power circuitssmashed trigger unitsfried interface circuitsburnt logic circuitsetcnotice every one of them peaking and then declining to near, or lower levels than pre patch announcement 3 months ago.these are the most basic building blocks of all rigs, small medium or large. if demand over time really went up rather than an initial spike due to a flood of ship reserves needing to be fitted, shouldn't those prices continue to go up.consider this, it's only been 3 months. what will happen at 6 months when this has had more time to normalize to the new settings? rig prices for the most part have returned to near pre patch levels and most are still on the decline even more. the most pronounced i've found so far is the core defense extender line. the larges have declined 33% from their pre patch levels due to the mechanics of building. by all the logic listed in this thread, that shouldn't have happened if the prices of mediums would drive up demand on all the drakes in game. since it's much harder to track, i'd love someone who frequents the faction markets to comment, but per the example i listed pages ago.centi c-type small armor repairer has seen an increase from 8 mil average to about 12 mil average since the patch. corpum medium armor repair appears to have increased by about 10 mil average.amarr navy energized adaptive nano membrane has gone up by around 80% from 22-25 mil up to 41-43 mil. all of this i miraculously predicted as the simple shift in funding from rigs to other gear to get the same type of edge that people claimed was class warfare in rigs. 31-7-09you can't solve that problem with the patch that was implemented."
9/17/2009,"the faction warfare system disagrees with you and it is essentially a pvp training ground for people ranging from newbies to long time players that never learned pvp. there are plenty of people flying around in things that are smaller than bc's because at 3-5 weeks most people can't afford to lose a bc every few days.simply put, the cost of a rig for a ship should be relative to the cost of the hull itself. you have yet to explain why that should not be so, or furthermore why it shouldn't have been that way all along. ccp either didn't think about it or didn't have the mechanics to implement it originally but now they do. i realize that you *want* rigs to be expensive things that make the owner feel like a unique snowflake but that's not what is best for the game.the skills for rigging aren't particularly expensive or long to train, it makes sense that newer players should be able to afford the rigs since they can afford the skills. beyond newer players though it makes sense for a rigged t1 frigate to incur a loss of a few million when it's blown up instead of 50m or so. if i had 50m to blow i'd fly an unrigged bc or cheaply fit bs which would be far more useful than a rigged frigate.rigs are not magical super mods and they shouldn't be priced as such."
9/17/2009,"your assessment of what the rig patch did, and then your claim that it is therefore bad is a pretty huge jump with pretty much nothing in the middle to explain how you get there.i understand the ""power creep"" issues and we were talking about that in iceland. if i remember right, it was agreed upon that rigs did create new balance issues and introducing yet more mods to alter ships is probably a bad idea past this point. but the rig patch itself, it was a boost to everything not a battleship or a capital. it provides me with more options to make my frigates better in certain ways that i wouldn't have bothered to do otherwise, and i think it's great."
9/17/2009,"currently, we are allowed to refuse any one mission in any four hour time period without loss of standings. this is put in place for good reason, to prevent isk/lp farming and standings grinding. however, the kind of delay for a level 1 mission should not be as long as a level 5 mission. what i propose is an exponential increase in refusal time allowance that makes more sense.level 1 - 30 minuteslevel 2 - 1 hourlevel 3 - 2 hourslevel 4 - 4 hourslevel 5 - 8 hoursthis will allow newer pilots to enjoy the game while still keeping reasonable caps on the isk faucets.discuss.edit: doubled cooldown times."
9/17/2009,"reasonable, seemingly well thought out. might need a bit more refinement though. no arguements from me.beats waiting 4 hours for my level 2 agent to let me refuse another mission because he has a fetish for gallante bodies/support"
9/17/2009,"i think you need to keep level 4 missions with a 4-hour timer. the problem is that there are certain missions which are trivial to complete, take very little time and have great rewards (level 4 recon 1 of 3 and 2 of 3 for example) and a character who may not otherwise be able to complete level 4 missions could just cycle through his agents until receiving this mission.2 hours is just not enough of a penalty.on the other hand, i'd love this change so i could keep doing those two missions as often as possible, doing no work and gaining lots of standings and lp."
9/17/2009,i think this is missing the main issue.join one of those alliances filled with gm's (i will not mention names) and i'm sure your petitions will be answered much faster.
9/17/2009,"supporting op as i have had several petitions where the gm clearly did not even read what i wrote (as in would suggest something i said i did in the first post). i don't even petition stuff anymore - like when that unexpected downtime happened, i had about 1/2 a mining mission done, and when i got enough stuff the site wasn't mined out so i couldn't complete the mission. i just mined the rest of it because i didn't want to deal with a petition.also, this is probably old, but one day i was reading the stuff on how bob was cheating and how they treated (banned) the guy that exposed it. it made me sad."
9/17/2009,tier 2 would be just overkill. tier 1? maybe. but no navy drakes!
9/17/2009,navy drakes with the black/red paintjob?tee hee!*runs from all the drake haters*-skan
9/17/2009,"they would certainly be cool, but i would never fly one. the primary advantage of a bc is its price/performance ratio."
9/17/2009,quite a cool idea. i for one would absolutely love to see a myrmidon with the black/white colour scheme *drool*..... saying that... navy hyperion please
9/17/2009,we beg a csm member to take notice and bring up this issue at their next meeting.
9/17/2009,specifically how is that done? who are the csm members? where do we beg?
9/17/2009,"great idea, having a different icon for what sort of sub-group the implant belongs to would be a good idea too (like armor)"
9/17/2009,thumbs up
9/17/2009,"practical, simple, and a bloody good idea."
9/17/2009,"i support the idea....but if this is such an issue for you, why not buy a few different small containers. sort them how you will amongst the containers. maybe you have 5 spare sets of implants, so have 5 containers, each with a spare set? shouldn't be too prohibitive.another idea: put the sets in your backup ships. this might not be as good since you might lose a ship without being podded. but if you do lose ship and get podded, you hop into your new ship and plug in the implants in the cargo."
9/17/2009,title says it all. it seems there have been several old threads and no reply from ccp (that i could find).
9/17/2009,"3 domi's with damage controls, hull rr and hull repair drones. why do i see this bieng just a little overpowered?not trying to yell at ya, but i dont see this working (nice idea though)"
9/17/2009,"i was thinking about what other shiptypes eve might need and came up with a destroyer-hull projected cloaking ship. (needs good name still)the basic idea is that it can fit 3 of these modules in high slots, each can cloak another ship. it can fit covert ops cloak itself, and 4 guns (meaning it has 8 high-slots).it's projected cloaking devices can be de-activated by the recipiant ship, act as a covert ops cloak (meaning no targeting delay) but cannot be used in warp.they would be primeraly usefull to bring ships close to their enemy before becoming visable to them. ships like blasterboats and tacklers would benefit from it a lot. the ships need to be flying close to the projected cloaking ship for the cloaks to work, but outside of the range where cloaking stops due to proximity so the max projected cloaking range should be about 5km."
9/17/2009,the idea sounds nice but it should have the following limitation:projected cloaks only work if the ship it self is not cloaked.using both at the same time is a no go.
9/17/2009,"i think you're right, although destroyer hulls are paperthin, perhaps them being uncloaked makes them too vulnerable, unless you use a cruiser hull. on the flip-side, since you can't tell what ships this one has in tow, people would think twice before engaging it. they could even bluff their way out of some engagements perhaps. almost like playing poker, which projected cloaker has the better 'hand'..."
9/17/2009,an anchor-able cloak bubble would be much better.
9/17/2009,why is it better?
9/17/2009,"just like the title states. if anything i would like to see the ability to train 2 characters at the same time on the same account. i would even consider the possibility to get rid of the 3rd character slot to be able to do this. although the 3rd would be nice even if you can't train in it. i understand ccp is interested in making money and this might make that profit less, however good customer service goes a long way, and enabling this would be great customer service, especially with the dust 514 leering it's ugly head at us hinting at even more game expenses if you want to take part in that. i'm curious how ccp will work that out hopefully we'll see some sort of package deal, and hoping it's not a big stiff one. anyways can i get a yay or a nay? i say yay!"
9/17/2009,"you already brought up the argument why ccp wouldnt do it:less subscriptions.and imho if you want to train more than one char, pay for a 2nd account."
9/17/2009,"actually i have 3 accounts, and my wife is going nuts over it lol. like i said sometimes having better customer outweighs more ""profit"". in fact the arguement of saying ccp will lose money if they allow this is not proven, and could be psuedo intellectual for the sheer fact that just the prospect of having to pay for another account in order to train another character effectively could actually cheese someone off enough that they just cancel their subscription period. i'm positive that has happened. i propose ccp to give it a try, and see how it pans out. they can always revert back to the old way if they lose too much. yay or nay?"
9/17/2009,following your example you would mostlikely close 1 account and move the toon to one of the other 2 accounts. you prove my argument. no?
9/17/2009,no.
9/17/2009,"dumb idea. there's no other mmo that lets you simultaneously gain xp on multiple characters on one account, why should eve?"
9/17/2009,pretty much this. just be glad eve doesn't require you to actually be logged in to train.battleships 5 would really suck then.
9/17/2009,"there must be a con to balance the pro of two in training. 1 char training = 100% training speed2 char training = both train at 50% speed. same sp/hour just spread across two characters. maybe even disable the skill queue or implants. this would still encourage multiple accounts to get faster training on both characters. but if for some reason you only had one account and really really wanted to, you could train two. i still don't see this happening."
9/17/2009,"why no merge accounts?lets me explain on mine little english.merge account 1 whit 3 characters whit account 2 whit 3 character, now you have a account whit 6 slots and giving you a profit a train 2 characters but paying double for it.i think ccp didnt want lose money and this idea is good for both parts."
9/17/2009,"somehow i don't see ccp going for this. instead how about somthing akin to what was posted before, training 2 chars but 50% or 60% training speed. maybe even paying to be able to train 2 cars on the same account for a price? $20-$25 a month for double training, instead of the $30, since you cant log on the same account twice."
9/17/2009,i agree with this; i'd pay extra to train two characters on one account. the problem will then become people farming characters to sell.i'd propose a special kind of account which costs extra (as suggested already) and does not allow character transfers -- ever.
9/17/2009,however it takes less time to lvl up in other mmo's than it does with eve. that's a fact.
9/17/2009,"you are only looking at one part of the whole. if implemented yes people may get rid of accounts and just transfer characters to less accounts. looking at the bigger picture, getting new players and retaining them in my opinion would be more important. are you ready? then read this, you missed it the last time. customers quit playing eve when they realize a) how long it takes to level a character up compared to other games. b) you have to pay for extra accounts in order to level up various characters in a reasonable amount of time. not all customers obviously quit but there are those that do. now before your head starts spinning like a possessed teenager girl watching the jonas brothers. it is good to compare this game with others, since the others are the competition and may actually pick up these lost subscriptions of eve, simply because they don't take forever to level up or what not. so really this is geared towards those lost accounts. sure ccp will lose accounts, but they will retain new accounts that are started thus negating the initial effect. so i bet you'll say well why don't you go play wow, which totally condtradicts your arguement of ccp will lose accounts if implemented, and show that you really don't care about ccp or this topic altogether. in that case go back to doing your high school homework and shut up. we need to improve the learning in game. it is in my opinion too slow. i think the timed learning is excellent, and i'm glad that i can train even while away from the computer. that is awesome for people who don't have a lot of time. however people who play the game more should gain xp faster than those who play it less. i would like to see bonuses to learning time to make it go faster while playing the game. like anywhere from 50-100% faster while playing. once logged off your training slows back down to normal speed. it's all about customer service, ccp probably wont do it, and people like you guys will never ever understand why this will actually bring in more money because you are too stupid to understand. do you want proof of this? look back to the regan days where we practiced trickle down economics and a major boom in business and capitalism. compare it to now where you have the liberal f#&@s who with their greedy tax policies keep tacking on tax upon tax but yet have no money to support their agenda, and ultimately the programs they implement for ths country fail, and consequently kill the economy as we know it. trickle down economics operates under the theorey that you lower taxes. more businesses are able to stay in business because they can afford to stay in business, thus enabling them to hire more employees who earn money and spend it in the economy. if ccp were to cut back on the cost of playing the game, more people will be able to afford to play the game, thus actually increasing the volume of players playing the game. in fact they may actually then activate another account if they want, either way ccp will earn more money. and you are all nubs."
9/17/2009,"supported, as one small step on the path to cleansing empire of the towers that defile the holy space."
9/17/2009,"i am sorry but i really can not see any reason to nerf high sec pos's as they are fine as they are, and yes i have taken out a large pos in empire before.not supported"
9/17/2009,"i personally managed 6 personal large pos's in 0.0 when i was in knights of the southercross. so dont tell me i dont know how hard it is to manage the pos. i had 3 mackinaw's mining 24/7 when i wasnt doing anything else to get enough ice to last. i also did the math and sorted my fuel properly to make sure i always had 32 days of everything in the pos.so i know how hard it is to try and manage a large pos. i am not whining about something being too hard, or unfair, i am asking for balancing, since thats what ccp seems to be doing. balancing the gameplay. and since you can use dreads/carriers in lowsec/0.0 against pos's, yet capitals are banned from empire due to the hp and ****, it only makes sense to introduce a new module or type of ship to perform like a dread/carrier, and be vulnerable to bs's and ****, while not being able to jump to cynos."
9/17/2009,and thats exactly the point the pos *is* vulnerable to a bs fleet. so there is no balancing issue here at all.
9/17/2009,"then i want you to wardec someone, and get 15 people together in battleships, and shoot their large pos. tell me how much money you spend on ammo. tell me how long it takes. tell me how many hardeners it has."
9/17/2009,1. armageddon2. plain t1 crystal3. fit some rr4. profit???
9/17/2009,i think its ironic that this thread has gone on so long after csm mazzilliu has already said no.
9/17/2009,"he said that they are fixing pos's and that this issue was 'moot'. we asked for info, and noones replied. so until then, i will keep this thread alive, for balancing purposes."
9/17/2009,"what she meant is that since pos warfare is going to be dramatically altered by the expansion, there's no way ccp is going to make one of the 2 dramatic revisions your suggesting in the meantime."
9/17/2009,did it occur to your thick skull that discussing this is a waste of time because ccp already made there minds up on the pos situation?if they already have an answer.... no csm is going to bring this forward.time to call it a day and wait for dominion.
9/17/2009,"i propose a frigate-hull shiptype that can use a module which can pull another ship along in it's warp. the pulled ship drops free mid-warp.the idea behind the ship is that it can be used to pull large capital fleets apart, dispurse them so you can quite liturally 'devide and conquer'.the hijjacker module can only be used on these ships, and have a maximum range of 2500 meters, so the hijjacker has to approach, lock and warp before the capital ship can lock it.this has another effect that capital fleets would do well to have a support fleet of smaller ships which can lock fast and warpscramble the incoming hijjackers. (think interceptors and the like)the reason that the hijjacked ship drops free mid-warp and not end-warp is that in the latter option it's too easy to trap the hijjacked ship in a bubble or otherwise trap it can't possibly get out of, making the hijjacker too powerfull.i propose a fitting somewhat like this:2 high,2 med,1 low.the hijjacker module would fit on a high slot, leaving it one spot for a turret or missle launcher: this is not ment to be a combat effective ship.in the med you'd often find a mwd or afterburner (or both) because these ships need to get really close to their targets before their targets can lock onto their small signature radius. this also makes these ships mostly uneffective against small ships with faster locking speeds. big capital ships are it's prime target, though they should also be usable against small gangs but this should be harder."
9/17/2009,"no, especially since you didn't explain why."
9/17/2009,2 reasons:- to make small ships usefull in capital ship engagements.- to be able to disperse large blob-fights into smaller engagements. (an anti-blob tactic that doesn't depend on the soon to be gone aoe ddd)
9/17/2009,small ships got a role in cap fights:1. kill support and drones/fighters2. tackle.your split battle in many smaller doesnt make much sense imho.not supported.
9/17/2009,"well, think about it this way, what other ship could temporarily take support ships, or ecm ships away from the battlefield, taking a minute or perhaps less to get back in the battle. also, if the warp-tug defeats scrambling then perhaps it can be used to pull a friendly out of a warp-scram. (if the hijjacker isn't warp-scrammed itself."
9/17/2009,"no other ship can do that, and i'm not sure why we need a ship that can."
9/17/2009,well how is having more diversity on the battlefield a bad thing?
9/17/2009,"have you ever tried to command a fleet? these ships would make that basically impossible.any ship the ""hijacker"" managed to pull away would be essentially dead. hijacker + covops + a few dedicated bs = anything that is tackled being dead. does this seem overpowered to you?"
9/17/2009,the reason a hijjacked ship pulls free mid-warp is to prevent it from being dead for certain.

9/17/2009,yes. i am. a covops can have a scan on something and be warping within 5-10 seconds if it has probes out.lock time is negligible. carriers can take time to align warp.
9/17/2009,"fair enough, how about this: a hijjacked ship is automatically alligned to warp back to where it came from. better?"
9/17/2009,we need a ship that can spit out a huge shockwave of millions of dps which could wipe out entire fleets. perhaps 3 of them at the same time could wipe out an entire bs fleet!!!oh wait...

9/17/2009,"and how would you choose the topic you want to reply to? you would flip some kind of check box? just as easy to click over to a different chat window....so why not have another chat or two for your corp/alliance? it would only be a matter of discipline to restrict the players to use the different chats for different topics, the same matter of discipline it would get to get them to use the different topics that you propose.not supported as this functionality already exists.edit: i misread. i thought he was applying this to chat. yes, eve mail needs some lovin'!"

9/17/2009,you want ccp to reimburse your bs loss to the faction navy?
9/17/2009,"well no kidding, the police try and catch criminals?! seriously what the hell did you expect? and since this post isn't a suggestion but rather a cranky stupid rant, i'm gonna report it and watch with deep satisfaction as ccp deletes it."
9/17/2009,"alright, so i was on irc last night and someone had the idea of a battle recorder for alliance tournaments. this could (potentially?) be used to record battles by the end user, but that's way out there, lets keep it simple for the moment.instead of actually capturing video using some method such as fraps, ccp records the information the server sends to the client and vise versa. as it's only the information, all rendering would be done on the client side. this should make for both small ""grid recorder"" (as it's been dubbed) files as well as making it non-process intensive to record. it should be even less process intensive as it's being recorded server side by ccp.ccp uploads these files and a special eve playback utility is used to play it. it would use the installed eve files to render everything, the difference would be that it wouldn't necessarily have to go online (everything done locally), and that you wouldn't fly a ship, the camera position would more than likely be fixed on whatever recorded the battle originally, but you could look at and move the camera round, user overview settings to view ship speed and distance, get info on ships/players, etc just as though you were watching the battle in eve. as i said, everything would be rendered locally, so you would be limited to what your machine can support as far as graphics. if you really wanted to get fancy you could introduce slowmo and pause, rewind, etc features.i'm sure someone will bring up the point that as it's only recorded information someone could mess with these files to produce false battles. as it's an offline file though, this isn't really important. you can make up a fake battle, but it won't affect anything in game. if you were really worried about this, then ccp could encrypt the file before putting it online for download.now, i don't know the exact technical limitations of what i'm talking about so now is the time for everyone to point out to me where i'm wrong. however, other than the difficulties in programming a grid recorder and playback utility, i really don't see how this would be a problem. the information is already read by the server and client and i would imagine is written to some form of file, even if temporarily. you just need to put that information into a format readable by the playback program, which could be done after the battle has finished at a later date, and build the playback program itself.so?linkage to original post:"
9/17/2009,"you know i actually brought up the same idea informally to one of the people working on the tournament, and the response was something like ""that's a lot of coding"".something ought to be done to improve the visuals, though. at the moment it's mostly just looking at pretty ships. the average person doesn't know what's going on. maybe ccp should hire john madden and get his markerboard that he draws on the screen with. that would be awesome."
9/17/2009,"i'd like to see it, and i can see it being useful for things like tourneys. if it's as much coding as mazz suggests, then it's probably not worth it, but i can support asking officially instead of unofficially, see if anyone comes up with an easy answer for it or something."
9/17/2009,"personally when i hear that i hear ""we don't feel like it"". i'm sorry, i normally stick up for ccp because i know making games like this, keeping them constantly running and relatively bug free is a huge task, and not one i'm arrogant enough to think i could do. however, no proposal should be tossed aside because it's ""a lot of coding"", anything in this game is a lot of coding. i don't think there is one thing that wouldn't require a lot of coding, certainly the major patches that are released every 6 months to 1 year are a lot of coding. i feel this is a pretty poor excuse.now if the problem is technical limitations (which i don't really see, and have been told other games have overcome to implement this idea anyway), or simple time (too busy working on other stuff/low priority) i can see, which i hope is what they meant by ""a lot of coding"". but yes, i would like this brought up in a more official capacity and some thought and real response given by ccp. i think it would be a lot less coding than say... walking in stations, which we haven't seen yet, but ccp has talked about doing for years now, and this would be much more functional and useful to the players."
9/17/2009,"as a programmer, i can certainly vouch for this interpretation of ""that's a lot of coding"". they want to spend the majority of their time on the stuff that will have the biggest impact. i'm not saying this shouldn't be brought up in an official capacity, but give them the benefit of the doubt. that would be a lot of coding for something that doesn't functionally improve the game, which is why i'm not supporting this proposal. only because there's so many other things they can work on that are much more needed and important (cosmos, or some kind of communication improvement, at least, dominion, 0.0, sovereignty stuff, more t3, etc.)"
9/17/2009,"code costs money. it's not an issue of laziness it's an issue of resource allocation. the alliance tournament creates a lot of hype and so forth but in the end doesn't bring ccp a lot of money, especially after broadcasting costs and running eve tv.""it's a lot of coding"" is a perfectly good reason to turn something down."

9/17/2009,"they work well solo and in groups, just depends on the balls of the pilot. massive dps in a package faster and less clumsy than a bs."
9/17/2009,"well when i said i don't think they are used in solo fights... i meant the ships original intended design was to ""command fleets"".nothing is to stop a clever pilot from wtfbbpqpwn'ing some hapless target in the nether regions of space.command ships can easily do this... but only in trained hands... much like any other ship."

9/18/2009,"there needs to be an extra tickbox or the wording changed.a lot of things are absurd but in the right direction. so you can make a post and suggest adjustments to original posters idea/issue but the current format only allows agree/disagree with original.either add a tickbox saying ""i support this topic, with the caveats/exceptions mentioned in my post"" or change the current tickbox to mean the same."

9/18/2009,this again since it seems to get lost in the 4th bonus (which i fully support in case of confusion) discussion.
9/18/2009,"i kind of like the current retribution. it has lots of damage, range and tank .. it has purpose.would be awesome to have tackle but fear it would jump to the top of the pile in the same way the zealot did with the 5th turret. tackling retributions would be immensely powerful.game has evolved a lot lately and more options are available. adding a bonus following the old scheme (tracking, damage, tank etc) is easy but uninspired and quite frankly boring.there is currently a push to add an ab bonus to all the assault frigates, which will likely end up invalidating all but three of them with the jaguar being supreme against everything.a better role bonus for the class, which would benefit all of them, is to borrow the heat resistance bonus from the t3 hulls and perhaps add a bit .. afs would gain speed, tank, damage and longevity without obsoleting any of them.make them ""special"" (in a good way, not the deliverance way). until then this does not have my support."
9/18/2009,i kinda find it a pitty that the amarr have the choice between an af which cannot tackle but does good damage or a heavy tackler that does no damage...just the mere fact that the retri has only 1 mid slot turns the amarr race into the race with the most inversatile af roles around. for my playing style anyway.

9/18/2009,"thank you for all the responses so far.you say this would be a strong point to field them, that's nonsense. if you read my proposal i say that they are slowly repaired over time. this means that it's by far less efficient than tossing them out and repairing them with your remote repairing devices. it's meant as a small addition so that they can easily recover when out of the heat of the battle.nobody would field a mothership because it get's an added addition which will make no difference in battle itself.i believe they should always have it however it might be interesting if there would be a bonus towards this mechanic if triage is active. i like the idea of having them put out of temporary use and put inside a separate deck as a ways of repairing them. this would be much easier than having to individually select which to repair. but i don't believe such a skill would be needed.o/ cs"
9/18/2009,"ok, just to save myself, for the record, i've never flown a carrier into a large fleet fight, so maybe i just don't see your point of view on this.where is the logic in your proposal though. you want to be able to repair drones for after a fleet fight, when it's 'out of the heat'. i don't see the logic in this, if the carrier is no longer in a fight, why not just simply dock up and repair your fighters? you said yourself that this would be most beneficial for after the fight is over, this is why i'm wondering."
9/18/2009,"picture this. you're flying a carrier as part of a fleet that has been deployed deep into hostile space. there is no place to dock and repair your fighters. you just finished a large fight and most of your drones are either destroyed or badly damaged. what do you do? you can't just jump back home, repair and return, that would be a logistical nightmare. even more so is the fact that a mothership (supercarrier) cannot dock. what now?the op's proposal makes perfect sense. it can be applied into real life situations as well. just use the above situation that i mention and change it into a rl one. a carrier jet has engine damage. are you going to bring the carrier back on what could be a 10,000 mile/~16000km round trip to fix it?i'm not even a carrier pilot in game and i understand the proposal!supported because the idea makes perfect sense and is common sense.edit: just thought about this as well. your carrier is in a wormhole. how are you going to maintain the damage that sleeper rats have done to your drones/fighters?"

9/18/2009,"turret per turret, the results look bad, as they should - as i explained, this is to prevent ac's being from defacto turret of choice.also remember that the void ammo featured in that example is the boosted (+7% damage) one.however, this isn't just a tempest fix, or a ac's boost. combine everything, the new target painter bonus, additional ac optimal range, the tempests increased speed, it's new slot layout, the improvements to 1200mm/1400mm tracking along with the 1650m and the synergistic way they fit together and i think you have something that provides a refresh.also, it's a fairer comparison to compare shield tankers with +1 damage mod because fitting damage mods on shield tankers has a lot lower impact on overall, none snipe performance.i'm looking at the raw stats only for a sanity check. most of the work relates to what role the ship accomplishes, as far as i'm concerned, the only minmatar ship left out of the charts was the typhoon and most consider it's performance pretty decent.please re-read the section on artillery."
9/18/2009,"the weapons look bad because are not balancedthe problem of people using ac is just for few ships that have not proper dmg bonus for the racial weapons and so use proj but this is kinda a special situation for ships whitout a racial dmg bonus on turrets and imo is not something bad by itself... a mega pilot maybe will use proj rather than hybrid if ac had better dps?... maybe yes but is going to lose a base 25% of his dmg so there is still a trade offif we dont want to allow ships of different races to use weapons from other ones the simplest solution will be to restrict them to such weapons, that is also kinda logical and in this way we have not create gimp weapons for the fear of other races using them.now about the ac graph... as said the fitting are extremely different... in the first graph the mega pilot have 2 slot advantage over the pest one and on top of that 37.5% better tracking tracking... what is the tradeoff for that?range? 1 tc and range will be quite similar and he will have even better tracking and 2 more slots advantage, thats not balanced at all... the curve as it is looks ok, but doesnt take in account other factors like tracking or mod used, cap and so onand note that is true that neuts use cap but also minnie ships need to load lot of ammos (expecially if in a situation like the graph one with a pest using torps+proj) and have quite gimped cargo bay so they use less cap but also can carry less cap chargesfor the second graph is kinda similar... the mega with rail do same dmg as the pest (again double bonus vs 1 bonus, 6 turrets vs 7) but the mega have waay more range and tracking (due to its second bonus) so, even if the dmg is similar the hybrid weapon have some great advantages over the projand we should consider too the base range of minnie sensors, is another story but imo have to be considered to ""assign a range"" to artiesif anything imo the balance should be made so that slotwise the things should be balanced... ok i need 1 more dmg mod so that 1 of my gun do same dmg as 1 of yours but then you will need 1 more tracking mod to be able to track as weel as mine and so on...if you get such an huge disparity of mods used you will not achieve a good balance, as said you can get a graph that look good for some particular ship and with some particular fittings, but that is kinda a subjective graph... if someone doesnt fit the weapons/mod you envisioned here that the balance go offbtw i liked some of the things in your post... the big gun, phoon with 5 and so on... but imo to touch proj should be something to do on its own not to fit a certain ship...first get the weapons balanced, then apply them to the ship and sdjust to rebalance them"
9/18/2009,"firstly, large ac's just gained +250% more optimal range.that separates them from the point blank higher dps blasters, and puts them in it's own clear damage bracket.secondly.raw dps isn't everything, there are so many factors to consider that simply pointing at neutron blaster throns and saying he has more damage than be doesn't really get anyone anywhere. you build a model, describe roles and niches for your weapon systems and ships as so that you avoid conflicting issues. simply giving ac's blaster damage would only result in gallente pilots wanting capless guns in the next season.thirdly.the tempest under these changes is no longer the fleet sniper of choice. that goes to the maelstrom (yellow). however, with the bonused target painter, and the improvements to 1200mm and 1400mm tracking, the tempest becomes considerably better (purple) at anti-support than it once was (green), at the same time proving a tracking bonus to all ships engaging it's target.fourthlyyou talk about comparing gun for gun, then you throw in the mega's ship tracking bonus, whilst leaving out the hyperion for example. all i can say is that this has been a pretty long process, with alot more considered than just this final outcome."
9/18/2009,err ... maybe look at the videos of darknesss and bulldogroheim.bulldogroheim even uses a vargur.nice try though
9/18/2009,"wait i'm not just speaking about dmg (cept for arty that need lot of it :p) i'm speaking about all the stats... is why i bring up the ""problem"" about tracking, about mods used and so ondmg is a component, but not the only one... my point is that there should be a tradeoff... if a weapon do so much dmg that another to catch it need 1 bonus+1mod then there should be something (tracking, range, both, who knows .p) so that the other weapon need 1 bonus + 1 mod to compete with that one in these departementsthis is not happening in the first graph and is why i spoke about the tracking bonus of mega and the slot used... and if it was the hype nothing had changed... as it had still a ""free bonus"" over the pest.imo is risky to compare the dps graphs of various ships to balance out the weapons as actually we are not comparing 2 weapons systems but 2 different ships with an envisioned fitting... of course it is usefull for the overall balance, but before that the ""main weapon balance"" should be dome mostly comparing just the weapons and their performances.as said i think you did a good job, some ideas are nice and about the ships i mostly agree with everything, but for proj i think the balance should focus on the weapon only and the kind of result you want to get... the ships come after that"
9/18/2009,supported. well done defining a core concept for the tempest pattern. all the changes provide a distinct role/set of capabilities for all three minmatar bs and large projectiles as well. perhaps reduce void's tracking penalty a bit as well? or just remove it? the cap use it causes is quite a penalty in and of itself.
9/18/2009,supported!
9/18/2009,"aye. my summary of changes:t2 ammo - still wouldn't use hail. for example void which is boosted in this proposal has less penalties, optimal is 0.75x whilst hail is 0.5x. with the new optimal for ac's a change to the optimal penalty would go a long way in changing my mind.vargur - yes. i have no idea why only the vargur was given nerfed pg due to ""don't want it being a pvp ship with nos/neuts in misc highs"" yet all the other races can fit them.typhoon - yes yes yes. give it the flexibility it should have being minmatar. plus you get a bit more benifit from damage mods if you fit 5 of a weapon rather than 4.fleet issue typhoon - might actually be worth the isk unlike the current design of ccps which has really poor upgrade compared to the other races.tempest - actually a reason to fly it now. long gone are the flexible role days when there was only 8 battleships and no rigs to further specialize for a role.fleet tempest - yeah, although i'd consider a 8th mid. hard to say without testing the proposed tempest first.maelstrom - improvements don't really help appart from arty fits for new 1650s so no problem with it.large ac's - god knows they need something and this will do. hit quality reduction just screw ac's due to ""minmatar fight in falloff"" stuff.arty - yes, long gone are the days of insta popping stuff with 6 gyro arty pests in pre-pre-boost hp level days that were the reason for giving them lowest range and tracking."
9/18/2009,summary added
9/18/2009,"void is not a minmatar ammo. furthermore, hail is always the wrong choice unless you're shooting a stationary dread at 1km. your changes don't really fix that, and nor do they fix emp and other ""problem"" areas.it already got a role bonus. the right answer here is to lower arty fittings or boost vargur fittings.agreed, because it helps take the edge off of wtf-skills required.i agree with the extra mid, i don't agree with the extra launcher.a 70km target painter is useless. i would rather strongly not want to waste a bonus on that. and yes, it is a waste. by making it suck because you don't fix the guns and now waste a bonus to help everyone else in fleet? yay, i always wanted to waste my tier 2 bs on having a ew bs! fly a zealot. 4srsly. this is not a battleship role.i don't think this would make the ship worthwhile to use when there are so many better ships out there, and about to be out there. it's a decent attempt, and better than what we have i think, but doesn't fix any of the core problems with it.nice, you manage to completely miss what makes the maelstrom frustrating to use: a lack of agility. i realize you're trying to redefine the role but... no.racial flavor? we didn't need that anyway. blasters? we didn't need those either. artillery will still be far and away the worst long range platform, even with the new tracking and 60km target painters.the maelstrom is already the main minmatar sniper. it's *that much* better than the pest.tl;dr:- your changes don't address the core issues that must be addressed. they further remove the race from what brought me to it in the first place. i would sell my minmatar pilot and buy (another) amarr pilot if these changes went live.- your changes don't affect eve that strongly, and they don't address active tanking."
9/18/2009,"i had a nice read over the changes, and i was about to reply when i saw liang already did it for me. pretty much represents my opinions, with one reservation. i'd rather the phoon get increased fittings than a 5/5 split - but that's just imo."
9/18/2009,"completely agree with pattern's suggestions, please make it so"
9/18/2009,"changes to large projectiles are long overdue. i believe pattern's proposals are well balanced and retain minmatar racial flavor.spare dronebay capacity is something many minmatar drone ships need (recons, pest/mael. cyc, cs, but not hacs or cane). additionally, all minmatar ships also need an ammo bay, though the need is direst for bs.latest sisi navy typhoon (8/4/8) is preferable to pattern's. bring back the 5/5 hardpoints however, please.the tempest definitely requires a fix but i am on the fence whether this is it. pattern has also left out the panther. i think both suffer from a lack of options for the minmatar utility high slots (panther especially since it has no launcher hardpoints). it would be a good minmatar boost to bring some ew capabilities to our utility highslots, whether ew strength mods (paint, web) or reduced efficacy ew mods (tackle, paint)."
9/18/2009,"although i do not fully support all these changes (would love to see a viable armor-tanking sniper, but i guess i can't), boost to minmatar > bc and the tempest in particular are long overdue. placing ac's optimal around disruptor range is a nice touch, and 1650mm arties on a mael would make alpha strike viable again."
9/18/2009,50% bonus to target painter optimal range per level. no ty gtfoand basicly you made the pest into a shield tanker which carnt shield tank
9/18/2009,"@marn prestoc- like i said in the shc thread, the changes to ammo are just a band aid, t2 ammo in for serious design review.@liang nuren- who said void was mminmatar? - this is a damage increase to blasters.- change artillery so that the vargur can fit 12"

9/18/2009,where can i sign?
9/18/2009,"i am bringing this back up to the front of the line again, especially since the proposed changes to the navy tempest and the new navy typhoon are not very good, and in the case of the navy tempest, is just.. unbelieveable how bad of a idea this is."
9/18/2009,much needed change.
9/18/2009,fast forward 5 years....the same 4 incumbents have been the same 4 incumbents for 4 years with any new first-term members not having the votes to break their alliance backed hold on those 4 slots...... same 4 members from same 4 alliances every year as a standard. getting more and more entrenched and suffering from greater and greater depths of hubris.someone new comes along and tries to shake it up.... ccp pulls the plug on them.... everyone screams....long terms in office are just as poisonous for organisations as they are for the egos of the people involved.after 8-10 years in rl office people start to think they might be caesar.
9/18/2009,"personally i'd prefer a simpler system if after your 2 term limit you can't serve consecutive terms. i.e. serve 2, next invalid, serve 1, invalid, and so on. as for issler, i was under the impression that this term didn't count towards the term limit."
9/18/2009,"the alternative is that it's filled with csm elites who rubbish the csm noobs, stalling the process and blocking ideas that don't come from the entrenched members.freshness and enthusiasm is much more desirable then creating a group of people who are essentially ""in for life""."
9/18/2009,"yeah that would be simpler. but the rule in the op would guarantee a constant supply of csm 1 or 2 term newbies(who will be in the majority, guaranteed 5 members minimum)i talked to issler a while ago just when it was happening and that was what i thought the situation was. if there was some official response later on i missed it. if the point is moot then i can remove that, too.also battlesmith is in la la landedit: if the majority of the csm likes my idea or omber's idea more, whichever one i will put in the wiki page to get voted on."
9/18/2009,"this is exactly how it starts, man! this is how dictators get into power! first they start by abolishing presidential term limits. i see what you did there . i'm on to you, senator palpatine."
9/18/2009,"nope, not a chance.csm has demonstrated well enough that it is entirely useless and should simply be scrapped."
9/18/2009,"very much not supported. the csm's not a reward for getting a lot of people to vote for you, and other people with fresh ideas need to be rotated through."
9/18/2009,"linux time schedulers are a cool thing that can be applied csm terms. for example:no more than 5 incubents-2 (former 2 cms season members)no more than 4 incubents-3 (former 3 cms season members)no more than 3 incubents-4 (former 4 cms season members)no more than 2 incubents-5 (former 5 cms season members)no more than 1 incubents-6 (former 6 cms season members)or something else.i do not support the solution described in the first post, but i support the core idea. a good solution will probably emerge after discussing this with ccp.something must be done with issler being disqualified. it's just not fair."
9/18/2009,not supported. all elected offices should have painfully low term limits.
9/18/2009,"hmm.. keep the term limits, but dont make them permanent.. serve 2 terms and be unable to serve again until 2 more terms have passed. just make it so the time in office=time out of office after you hit your term limit."
9/18/2009,"we have a constant stream of new people wanting to get in to csm and the old corrupt officials need to be booted out to make room for the newcomers. if at some point we can't find enough new people who are interested in the job, we can scrap the whole thing as people have clearly moved on."
9/18/2009,"this is the part where i say not just no, but hell no.let's face it,emove term limits then the largest alliances will always be garunteed a seat, not based on the merit of their candidates, but based on the number of members in their alliance. that's rubbish, to be quite frank, and it's a crappy idea.at that point, you don't have to care about the larger player base, only about keeping your alliance members happy so they'll vote for you en masse next election.so thank you, but no thank you."
9/18/2009,"agreeing with this, spend the money on better servers or something so we can have the directional scanner back."
9/18/2009,what do you honestly think the odds are of the csm voting to disband itself?
9/18/2009,hellno
9/18/2009,"fail for thinking one csm proposal not being implemented (yet) meaning that it is entirely useless. no matter the support, ccp has final say. (and have they even been able to bring this up to ccp?)i think a max of 2 over-termed incumbents should be allowed to stay, provided that there no incumbents currently in their first term that are running for their second."
9/18/2009,"1) this is a silly restriction, that makes less sense than the current one by far. you'll be disenfranchising thousands of voters with this, and buggering up the elections totally. no. 2) arbitrary exclusion of viewpoints ccp doesn't like...isn't this what the csm was originally intended to prevent? hell no. 3) yup, fully agree with this bit. #3 is reasonable, but there's no way i can support this as a whole."
9/18/2009,"do you honeslty think that if ccp decides to disband the csm they're going to bother asking what the csm thinks about it? appearances aside, this is still a dictatorship ruled by ccp (which is as it should be, being as it's their sandbox)."
9/18/2009,we know the evil in the details.we just need to find the best solution.would be 2 slot for one or other solutions.just talk a littlebit what is the best.
9/18/2009,i agree with this idea
9/18/2009,"its a needed change, station camping moros are stupid and another example of why the eve player base can't have nice things."
9/18/2009,"it's a idiotism. the redock time need change after aggressing at station. want to figt ? do it, but if u got criminal flag u cant dock.simple, but this b*llsh*t ruined and nerfed an another shiptypes because ccp made it, an unlogic 45-60 docktime after agression when the station sentrys shoting the target. lol who invite a criminal inside his house who shot outside???nobody, but ccp leaves it. problem is the redock time, not the moros.we want more fight, not to lurk make the play better, just regulate properly the timers and cloakers.problem with the huggers you told, but just they will make moros nerf ? why ? just an moros can do station huggin ? no, can do 50 other ships too. just one or two ship need for that, a support ship and a damage user.so, dont nerf the moros use brain and solve the original problem, which create this."
9/18/2009,fyi. the moros nerf never made it to sisi. while all other changes have happened. moros needs to be left unchanged.
9/18/2009,"greetings.i raise this issue as i consider an important factor in faction warfare. as it stands now, npcs inside a warfare complex do not fire on person who has too good standings towards respective faction.what this means in practice is that pirates or hostile militia can enter warfare complexes and in worst case, npcs stand idly aside. now, this might have some role-playing perspective about navy ships being afraid of capsuleers but i dont buy it. npc pirates quite happily suicide their frigates against capsuleer battleships.even more worrisome is the attitude of certain people, namely ex-csm member ankh, who are happy to continue using this bug and saying it works as intended, to capture complexes without actually doing any actual work for it such as killing the npcs defending it.this has been a problem since start of faction war. surely it would not be so hard to correct code that npcs inside would automatically shoot everyone who is not a member of friendly miltia?damar rocarionbrigadier general"
9/18/2009,"the only reason i'd disagree is because it sounds like people are wanting this to get easy kills. hell, if ccp decides to do this, i want my orca back to the way it was. i don't need an ore bay."
9/18/2009,"going to keep it short. no.too much advantage for the enemy, too little for the defender. covert ops cloak ships will be ftom forever. that about sums it up."

9/18/2009,"how about this? in low sec they show a number at the top for how many people are there...and replace individuals with corp logo's and tickers? so you can see how many people are afoot. and what corporations they ""may"" be from.and in o.o change it so you can just see corp logo's and tickers but no numbers at the top? this would let you know wheather or not the system was empty also would let you know if your wt's are hiding there but not which ones or how many.in wh space keep it like it is...blank unless you talk in it.and last but not least in high sec...group all members from the same corp together under their corp logo and tickers so with numbers at the top and listed on the ticker for each corp so when u left click it opens the corp and u see all the wt's i mean people from that corp grouped together and when you r click it gives you the corp info. this would clean up high sec local and make scanning local easier in say high traffic areas and on top of that it would be much better public exposure for corporations.comments?"
9/18/2009,oh yeah also with this idea of mine when people talk in local the talker's char name would still show up in the chatbox same as it does now. just the listing on the right hand side would be affected by this change..we wouldnt want to make life hard on spammers and we dont want to ruin the actuall friendly interaction of people just trying to have friendly conversation's either ;) i think this idea would help everyone even the miners with or withought the scanner nerf. it's ussually somone with probes that you really need to worry about as for miners they will just rush the belts anyway...so alltogether cloakers get a bonus miners get to keep their run for the hillz local and fleets will know if their wt's are present. its local streamlined comments?
9/18/2009,"not supported, sizing the rigs where the most sensable change ccp have made in ages.now do the same with all 1 sized modules.and people stop *****ing because you lost some isk on a balance that was clearly needed."
9/18/2009,"you do realize recon 1 of 3 deals insanely high dps, right?however, you do have a point. level 4 missions might still need a 4 hour delay. i would not be opposed to doubling the time cooldowns, but the point stands that the cooldown for lower level missions should not be as high as higher level missions."
9/18/2009,when did that change? last time i checked you didn't need to take any significant damage: engaging the rats is optional.
9/18/2009,"this seems fairly reasonable, i think. nobody is worried about people farming l1s, and it helps new players while keeping the status quo on the relevant ones."

9/18/2009,as long as the navy harbinger doesn't have that ugly greenish hue like the apoc.
9/18/2009,i want navy freighters
9/18/2009,the navy apoc just got nice darkish platings. see sisi
9/18/2009,"first, apologies if this has been raised before.as it stands now, getting banned on sisi for violating the rules has, effectively, no serious repercussions. however, whatever actions resulted in the ban are usually a significant inconvenience to the other players affected (e.g. voogru et. al.). i believe that interfering with people attempting to help improve the game for the benefit of the broader community should be more heavily penalized. i would like to see a ban on sisi be automatically accompanied by a corresponding temporary (whatever period is deemed ""reasonable"" - 2 weeks? 1 month?) ban on tq."
9/18/2009,"it was my understanding that any misstep on sisi results in an immediate permaban from sisi. a little too harsh to apply that to tranquility, as well, in my opinion.in fact, if your motive is for the game to be improved through testing, i think the very threat of this possibility would be enough to make many potential testers not even set foot in sisi for fear of getting their tranquility account banned. i know i wouldn't, and i'm a respectful pilot that (i don't think) would ever get banned from sisi."
9/18/2009,"this seems incredibly draconian. i'd favour better enforcement of rules on sisi, but tq punishments for sisi violations is far too harsh."
9/18/2009,the cancer has hit sisi so badly. so many people who simply havent read the rules are getting on there. who then break the rules. bh then issue threats in a fast moving local channel to stop. most people arent even watching local half the time.rules broken? sure... banned from sisi? sure. add on top of this... it's fairly easy to get people banned. i'll just leave it at that.sisi is meant to be a server people can go test on. this leads to bug fixing. if you ban people from sisi... then there are less people to fix bugs. the caveat... you're banning gomers who only impede testing. for example gomers who sit at the pf- gate and kill people.the balance is questionable here.if you add in the factor of draconian banning rolling over onto tq. that would mean not only a drastic reduction of people on sisi. as i certainly wouldnt be going on there. it would also means a drastic number of paying customers who may or may not be contributing to make eve better... are now going to leave the game entirely.that isnt good business for eve.
9/18/2009,"it'd be like doing exactly the same thing with armor, except with lower resists and vastly worse rr. anyone who did that would deserve the horrible death that came to them."
9/18/2009,above poster is rightthe idea is good and i thought about it too ^^
9/18/2009,do we really need to make it harder to scout for gatecamps?
9/18/2009,"if you see one of these ships around a gate you know he'll have upto 3 ships cloaked with him, so you know if a gate is camped if you see this ship. with the previously mentioned anchorable bubble idea there could be any number of ships under there, that seems overpowered."
9/18/2009,"how about this. anchorable by covert ops only. 4 convienient sizes (sml med lrg x-lrg)based on ship size. detectable by getting within 99km reactivation penalties and can locate with high lvl scanner and probing skills to within 150km's ""warpable"" and comes in hand with new probes and drones used for the purpose of scanning it to 150 and then sniffing it out. x-large can hide a small pos for predetermined time. could cloak mission's and sites dont forget it is trackable with good skills and the right probes/drones. command modules will work in cloaked sites/missions etc. but not for ships hiding ""just"" inside the bubble itself. anchorable in all sec's. making it usefull for all kinds of things.comments"
9/18/2009,"now heres possibbly the scariest cloaking idea in eve. 3 indestructable module's from an ancient extinct alien race more pwerful than anything ever seen before found in wh space. for some reason it cannot be stored in any npc station cant even dock with it on your ship. but seems to fit just fine in pos and any other destroyable object. cant be sold or traded. only jettisoned or left from the wreckage of the previous owner. and whats worse it has a mind of its own if it stays dormant for too long it returns to wh space and has to be found and fought for all over again. what is its adzact ability??1. can fit on any ship with a high slot.2. ship fitted with the device can target while cloaked and recloak imeadiatly after firing. can re cloak when targeted as long as its not disrupted webed or scramed nos'd nueted receiving any kind of remote assistance etc. and can operate any non-weapon while remaining cloaked3. host ship recieves bonuses acrross the full spectrum of command module bonuses camparable to the leadership command modules being trained to lvl 5 and can still recieve aditional bonuses from a command ship etc. 4. ""the best or worst part"" via the r click menue can cloak (any) targeted ship's (while remaining cloaked itself)causing them to be remain cloaked until they target. or activate any modules (meaning they can bump into things and remain cloaked) also meaning an entire fleet could be cloaked no matter the size or nuber of ships including pos even when the target is under attack5. mining vessels cloaked by the host ship can target and use all modules while cloaked 6. ships cloaked by this module recieve speed bonus's comparable to covert ops lvl 5.lets face it thats what we really want ;)now what reason do i have to think this would be an acceptable demon to release on the world of eve? beacuse according to history somthing this dangerous was released on the real world once and any army holding it was considered invincible ""the ark"" thats why i am proposing 3 or possibly less of them to be in existence. not only will it give the possibility of a fleet just decimating everything but since eve is a real world market it would be pricless and we all know the back stabbing that would come with it could possibly rip alliances to peieces from the inside out. any pilot can use it and it's possibilities are endlesswhat would this eve abomination be called? how about arc (alien reconissance cloak)and heres how the discription could read..lolgaurded by the fiery sword of heaven the gate is impassable to the wicked only the pure of heart my pass the golden box awaits the lions return resting under the watchfull eyes of the angels only the holy shall remain to ask and recieve the truth.""lets say its in a dead end wh but to get to it you have to pass through a class 6 or say 7 which is nothing but one big site and then at the end of that you have to go in your pod and jump through or the gaurdians will destroy you with their tech x ""sword"" and then u must face the oracle and if you dont answer the silly questions right your pod jumps back to high sec withought the answere but if you do answer right she allowes you to board a nice t3 cruiser of your race and enlightens you as you board by maxing out all of your skills just for fun"" (this enlightenment would only happen for the person that found the device in the site not anyone that obtains the devise afterwords they would just get a bonus to learning skills while they we in possession of the object aka it was in their assets)before i say comments? i will let you know i know this is redicoulous i just think it would be funny to see the look on ccp's faces when they read it lolcomments?"

9/18/2009,"if you feel like ""i'm down"" should read the dev blogs on how doomsdays are going to be completely removed as an aoe weapon in the next expansion, post here.seriously, now that that ccp has stated its intentions to totally overhaul titans, the doomsday-whine threads can probably stop."
9/18/2009,"actually, i just edited to clarify. it means the new dd proposal"
9/18/2009,so you'd keep the old aoe dd over this new one?no. get on sisi and check out how awesome it is for yourself.
9/18/2009,"it's a pretty terribly worded op, really.the old dd mechanic is terribly terrible, but this isn't a whole huge amount better. rather than blowing up 100 bs at 100m each and once every hour, it can blow up caps at a rate of 12/h at 1.5b each, with absolutely zero chance of friendlies getting killed (assuming the titan pilot is not ******ed).there are so many better things the titan could do to influence a fight which doesn't involve ""direct"" effects such as instant damage dd's and which are much less prone to exploit-by-numbers. a targeted dd is not the way to make the ship supremely powerful without being overpowered."
9/18/2009,/thread
9/18/2009,my proposal:require 2 accounts to be able to train 1 character. additionally make training 3 times slower than current.
9/18/2009,"an unnecessary change that will end up decreasing revenue for ccp.better to let the allow the skill queue to look at other characters so that if ""main"" queue runs out it starts on the alternate's queue.will still reduce revenue but not as much i think."
9/18/2009,"i'm going to support this simply because i'd really like it, not because i think it has a chance in hell of happening"
9/18/2009,"you do realize that eve is such a good game like it is because of the amount of money ccp makes, right?no thanks. i'm not risking my favorite pastime for something as trivial as this.edit:paragraphs."
9/18/2009,right as you have to play *actively* in other games to level up at all. the only thing that gave eve a chance for me was the skilling while being offline.
9/18/2009,"and you are failing to realize that a) paragraphs exist and b) ccp wants to lose the accounts of people who are put off by the skill training, but does not want to lose the accounts of people who actually like the game.ccp are coding a game that they like, and we like. they don't want to make it wow. if their players would rather play wow because of leveling up, that is fine. go play wow. just don't ruin our game."
9/18/2009,"paragraph? listen lets be honest here with ourselves. two characters training at the same time on an account will not ruin this game. nor will a 50-100% bonus while playing the game ruin it. even with a 100% bonus it may seem a lot, but it isn't really. of course there will be people who will try to sit idle at a station all day while they recieve bonus, but that could be worked around. yes people will go into space and cloak and hide all day, but that could be worked around as well. oh yeah, paragraph.your end of days talk is really just fear of change, however you fail to realize that when you started playing the game you were told that the game would change. i don't care if you even played this game for five years, your sense of entitlement to anything just because you played for a long time means jack s$%t, it still doesn't provide a good reason for this game to not improve upon it self. many people that i have talked to, who play this game, that aren't going to quit, feel that the learning system is lacking, lets improve on that. i knew some jerk would direct me to wow. i find it funny how someone who disagrees with anything in here, is told to go play wow. i mean sheesh if i wanted this game to be like wow i'd be asking for ugly neon colors to be emanating from the ships, while they wield ugly flamey looking swords, and it would also be cool if we could find some hot pants for the megathron to prance around in, because nothing says more about your leetness than a megathron in hotpants. the dominix, lets just put a paper bag over it and call it good. i would also like to see the falcon cast mage spells, or maybe that would go well with the guardian or the scimitar. nub"
9/18/2009,"what about a variation on this idea? say, the first toon trains at normal speed. 2nd toon trains at 1/10th speed. it certainly would be nice to have a little scientist or trader as an alt."
9/18/2009,ok so its the exact same as the one ccp have made butbecause the gun send of such a big charge i propose it makes a small/large smartbomb kinda idea when it hits the ship targeted inflicting maybe a quarter or a half of damage to sarrounding ships.its not perfect but would be better than the hit one target untill gun cycles :p
9/18/2009,because one shotting capitals isnt enough it needs to be aoe again riteno shut up
9/18/2009,"you know they have actual, usable weapons on titans now, right? no need for hitting multiple targets this way, i think."
9/18/2009,/signed
9/18/2009,no.
9/18/2009,thank you for you well thought-out constructive counter statement as to how this idea would not work. i look forward to your further responses.
9/18/2009,you seriously don't see how insanely overpowered this would be?
9/18/2009,"i can see that it would change pvp combat a lot, but if i look at how people can adapt to counter this ship, it's not that hard. you fly with a destroyer escort and this ship is toast. i mean, frigate hull, has to get really close to hijjack, it's quite counterable. people will change their tactics to accomodate this ship. also note that if you bring a wing of these than those pilots aren't flying dps-boats instead, so you sacrifice something. in the end, players adapt, and it ballances itself out. or atleast, that's the goal. if it doesn't meet that goal, how would you change the design so it does?"
9/18/2009,"just a thought:you would need to apply the current bumping mechanics (mass behavior esp.) to your idea. it would take your hijacker frigate *ages* to pull anything larger than another frigate up to the speed for warp. (warp mechanics have to apply aswell of course.)so you have a frigate size engine that tries to accelerate a cruiser/bs/capship size mass to its own warp speed. lets say 250m/s which is a reasonable frigate base speed, given it should work as kind of a tackler and has to move itself quickly through the field.with all those problems i dont see a role for it. you want to eliminate ships from the field? shoot them. makes them gone for much much longer."
9/18/2009,"well, looking at it that way, the ship has more applications. a few of these could 'tug' a larger friendly ship outside of a warp-bubble for instance. or if the pulling force isn't enough to pull a ship into warp, it'll still move it a fair bit, for instance back out of blaster-range. think of bumping a ship to prevent it from docking, but more effective."
9/18/2009,"this would make a perfect lol ship.i can see all the people raging as their ships are pulled away from what they are doing. i could see this mechanic abused to oblivion just for the lols. i can see ccp facepalming thinking ""what have we done??"" as the forums fill up with yet another bunch of whiners and the griefers trolling them.not to mention the new vids popping up with benny hill music..see where i'm going?not supported. while it is a freaking hilarious idea, it doesn't make sense in the battlefield. if you want to move a ship, bump it."
9/18/2009,i feel like pvp is fine as it is. your ship would be just a ridiculous complication that would **** people off.
9/18/2009,"if you are a fan of the new sisi 1 shot kill weapon and potential it gives titans, here's your chance to show support."
9/18/2009,back up...i'm still looking for a proposal or an issue in your op.
9/18/2009,simply no.. no more bonus of any kind to pvp'ers which weakens pve'ers even more
9/18/2009,"not supported. me podding you, must hurt you. if you dont lose anything all my fun is lost ( no tears from you, no satisfaction for me ) = i quit eve, i have wow around the corner."
9/18/2009,"explain to me, how you would be able to retain the implants? i mean, when you're podded; the corpse floats around in space looking pale and all. perhaps it gets blown up in a area of effect, or someone miss clicks and destroys it. point is, you can't have them implants teleported to you.and if i'm not to much out and drinking, i can't even remember any information pointing to that the pirate fleets officers are flying in pods."
9/18/2009,"eh? its a pvp centric game, not wow.how do this weaken pve???????but to the point, i do not support this idea, magical implants seem stupid."
9/18/2009,i propose that certain features be added into evemail:-filtering-time stamps-foldersthis will allow people to catagorise and sort through their email in a more efficiant mannerthank youbjon.
9/18/2009,yes...and outbox would be nice too...
9/18/2009,"i can understand how it's used for npc stations but please let directors free unused research/manufacturing slots which have been canceled but are still ""in use""."
9/18/2009,imho that part of the mechanic is shared between npc stations and pos labs.i think we should expect some level of responsible behavior for people doing industrial work.not supported.
9/18/2009,"that's really good news, cant wait."
9/18/2009,non-constructive. locked.
9/18/2009,the tourney is getting close to watchable for non-eve players. a little more spectacle in the camera work and i'd be able to get friends to watch more then 1 match.a battle recorder would buy millions of dollars worth of advertising.machinima and very well cut corp adverts would proliferate across youtube at a greater rate then they currently do.being able to post-edit and toy with camera recordings would give these people the ability to create better content promoting eve.there are several professional edits on youtube which are of a higher quality then what ccp produces in-house for trainers.... more of these could only be good.edit: of course spend time coding better evemail and allowing pop3 access first :-p
9/18/2009,"i agree with this interpretation of events. imagine being able to record a battle without the lag that fraps causes and still having your overview. basically recording without worrying about risking your ship trying to get good angles or something. later you turn up your graphics quality, turn off your overview, slowmo portions of it, get the right angles, all without lag.videos would be everywhere! it would be the biggest and some of the best marketing ccp could get! also, i'm no legal expert, but i bet sense the footage was taken from ccp's game they would technically own it, no matter who did the final editing, and would be able to use it for their own commercials/advertisements. maybe i'm wrong, but lawyers could make a good argument for this, and even if i'm still wrong, the free advertising aspect makes up for it.again, i try not to underestimate the extreme amount of work that goes into this game. i didn't mean to imply that it would only be a couple hundred lines that they could finish in a week, only that it would be less work than many other projects they've tackled in this game (walking in stations, complete sov changes + dust, creating wormhole space). yes, i agree that there are more important things that need to be done first (pos redesign comes to mind), but i don't think that those things should mean that this idea gets tossed out. it would be better to say ""this is a great idea, but it won't be accomplished until after x, y, and z are."". just because an idea is great doesn't mean it should or has to be the very next thing implemented, but it also doesn't mean it has to be tossed out. or perhaps never, if that's what ccp decided in the end. to get that answer though i think it need to be brought up in an official capacity.edit for formatting"
9/18/2009,"didn't get much attention, would still love this"
9/18/2009,"this idea was within a portion of my consolidated account security proposal, and already brought to iceland and discussed with ccp.i dont remember the exact response they gave though, on this particular point. i think they were interested, but you'll see their whole responce when the meeting minutes are released"
9/18/2009,"i have one of those. the physical version is a vasco digipass go-6 rebranded with the blizzard logo. it uses des, 3des, or aes to generate a one-time pass code that is valid for something like 30 seconds to 1 minute. the pass codes expire after being used, and include an internal clock as part of the hash input. it also apparently uses either the serial number or another input linked to it as a unique per-keyfob identifier. there's also a cellphone app version... last i heard the iphone version was the only one released in the us.the physical fobs use a 6 digit numeric code, and the phone app ones use an 8 digit numeric code.it requires the additional code to log into anything, including account management, and after i *****ed at them about how easy it was to remove, they made it require an additional two codes to unlink it from the account once you're logged in to management.if you lose it you have to call up and get the third degree to get it removed. if it just stops working it might be easier as you'd have the serial number."
9/18/2009,"well you see. it's difficult to give feedback on an idea if i can't read the damn thing! if you are on a computer than writing in standard english isn't all too hard. now if you are texting people on a mobile, then fine."
9/18/2009,blame your teachers..but i think you are just lazy.please quit eve and life
9/18/2009,get this moved to the assembly hall. also read the assembly hall sticky if you are confused
9/18/2009,isn't huzzah's alliance logo a weed leaf?
9/18/2009,"yep. google ""dope leaf"" go to google images. the first damn image that comes up is the one they used to form the logo."
9/18/2009,and by soon they mean - they saw a continent drifting and asked it where the fire was.
9/19/2009,this was brought up with ccp and the issue is being addressed :)
9/19/2009,thank you dierdra and ccp!
9/19/2009,"supported. question...why do they call these carriers and motherships at all? they arent. they do not fulfill that role in any sence of the word instead lets call them...t2 frieghters. i jumped a ""carrier on sissy with a smart bomb rokh and decimated his first wave in moments. he nueted me but i learned about the nuet from the try before and had cap booster 800's when i was done it was a freighter. pathetic! i say lets talk them into making more realistic carriers and motherships. counter proposal. carriers are floating cities they should be fully capable of repairing anything that can fit inside them. they should have 4 bays drone (fighter) if you really want to call automated drones with no ai fighters. frigate bay capable of holding up to 20 active piloted frigates or a mix of frigs and destroyers. repair bay capable of repairing ships up to destroyer class and capable of slowley building, drones up to destroyer class as long as ther are all the proper materials/bpc's available in the cargo bay, and usable by fleeted ships as a fitting bay. cargo bay big enough to hold materials for building formentioned items and repairing them.lets face it that is what a carrier should be. when a frigate pilot say in a bomber decides to dock to it he would do it the same way he would dock to a station then he would just get a ""orbit cam of the carrier and a undock button would show up in the lower left hand side of his screen. or if its not to much to ask they could even make a carrier docking bay screen for when u dock. it would look like a station only heavilly condenced. pilots could enter the fitting tool there and get in line at the repair bay. is that overpowered?? good!! thats the whole freaking idea behind a carrier! as for motherships same general idea bigger capacities but able to build and store 1 built ship in multiple bays exept frigates and fighters which would automatically move from the build que to their respective launch bays, anything destroyer size and above would have to undock before another could be produced they should be able to build anything up to a hyerion and would probably need an aditional bay to store at least 2 hulks so they could continue their mission even if they are lost deep in wh space because, a mother ship is suposed to be a capabillity not liabillityand maybe instead of nerfing good ships try making the ones that stink better, they could start with the cormorant?comments?"
9/19/2009,"also wanting to add to this that hull damage is one of the most annoying things to your drones, especially as there are no hull maintenance bots and fitting a capital hull repair system is a waste of a high slot as you will rarely use it over per example shield/armor remote reps, drone control units, smartbombs etc."
9/19/2009,"good idea, i support it."
9/19/2009,brilliant!supported.
9/19/2009,bringing this up for the next csm meeting
9/19/2009,"it is ironic that the second class of ships a noob will encounter (using standard size progression) cannot be fit with his/her skills. it takes solid support skills to make the thrasher work at all, and maxed-skills to make it shine. of the catalyst, coercer*, and cormorant no amount of skills seems to enable them to perform adequately.destroyers badly need a rebalance (ship bonus, powergrid, sig radius, and cpu at minimum).* fun fact: i actually had to look up the name of the amarr destroyer. i've not actually seen one in use in years, and had forgotten it."
9/19/2009,"possibilities to fix destroyers.as i see it now destroyers are papertanked drone killers that dont even fulfill that role effectivly because if the enemy fleet has one missile module between them your gone no matter how good your range is. destroyers suposedly were intended to massaacre frigates but my kesteral will walk right through a well tanked destroyer withought letting off the ab and fly through the explosion. so how about this..proposal.glass cannons aproach. make it so they can all fire effectivly from 0-30km range. no fall off and better tracking than any other smaller ship and smallest guns. no rof penalties damage increase to make it hazardous to t2 frigs and t1 cruisers if ignored. and good base resists across the board to make them less brittle against frigates. keep the sig rad how it is so bs, battlecruisers and med drones can still dispach them. easilly. in short make these 4 scenarios happen.a. a cormorant warps into the middle of 5 t1 frigates locks them and blows one of them away before his disrupter and web has even activated. another blows up just before entering warp another escapes leaving the pointed target to the destroyer 4 dead 1 escaped. minimal damage done to the destroyer. if they stay and fight they all die and the destroyer might have hull damage.b. a harpy attacks a cormorant. althought the cormorant recieves significant damage it wins with 30% of its hull still intact.c. five cormorants jump a cruiser although they are doing amazing damage (at first) the cruiser manages to tank them for the whole minute it takes for it to blow them all away with its heavier firepower. the cruiser heads to the repair bay with 15% of its hull still intact. the pilot just glad he didnt take a ""bio break"" now opts for a change of underwear and a smoke.d. 2 oposing fleets of say 10 to 12 collide. durring the battle a destroyer slips in unoticed at first and begins tearing through a moa's shields, by the time the moa realizes it being killed by a destroyer and not ""the"" harbinger which is only hitting him with one gun for distraction while focusing most of its firepower on a primaried drake it is too late he cant target him fast enough and hit him hard enough before his hull is ripped to shreds. the primaried drake however did fianally notice and after he pulled all his highs of the harbinger fired a volly that reached the cormorant just as the moa pop'd blowing whats left of the destroyer to bits and whats worse 2 more destroyer's just came in and are wiping your fleets drones out in short order as soon as they start geting targeted they switch to attack your frigates and whipe out 3 before they are finally silenced. unfourtunatly you loose the battle due to the loss of dps. this would make roaming gang's of destroyers possible and even dangerous with the attachment of falcon's it would make them able to decimate drones and t1 frigates. hold their own against 1v1's with t2 frigates and make them valuable in a fleet and possibly even earn them the honor of being primary not because they are weak but because if you dont exploit that weakness you will regret it.comments?"
9/19/2009,"hopefully ccp will tell us a bit more about dust at fanfest. i too love pc based shooters (and dont own a console), and since dust is being developed with the unreal engine, a pc version shouldnt be technically difficult.unfortunately i fear this topic falls outside the scope of the csm, since it is more about the business side of ccp rather than the game and technically isnt even about eve, but about a different game alltogether."
9/19/2009,1) i have made a thread to gather all ideas for sound improvements. this thread is not there to collect bug reports/sound faults.
9/19/2009,"out of curiosity, how do you pinpoint a ship by spamclicking the scanner? since you're warping and spamclicking, i'm assuming you weren't using the 5degree angle scan. since you wont have any directional or distance info, all you know is that 'ship x is withing scanrage y' of my current position. which doesnt give you nearly enough information to engage a target.i may be missing something here, but i am pretty sure you're missing a few steps between 'spamscan system' and 'kill target'. yes scanning probes take a little time to set up, but you can cover an entire solar system with them once they are set up, and warp to targets immediately instead of having to figure out what exact location they are at (not to mention the directional scanner is useless against safespots)."
9/19/2009,"you are indeed missing things, some call it spaming, i call it fast scanningscouts with the know-how about quick scanning are valuable and belive me it isnt just simple spamming of the scan buttonyou are also wrong about not being able to pinpoint target while warping and scanning, i did it all the time even while warping and using 5 degree scan scanning celestial objectsknowing if target moved within parts of second is vital sometimes,anyone suggesting probes can replace good inital scouting of a system need a reality checkthe explanation that this change was neccessary to reduce lag from clicking scan button is ridicolous, everything we do in this game causes lag, will ccp introduce timer on every button there is in game ? there are things used way more then scanner, they too cause lag, improved graphic causes lag, every action in game causes lag ...but we can live with certain amount of it and we can definitly live with lag that is caused by scannerif ccp wants to reduce lag they should be looking at other sources to minimize it"
9/19/2009,"entering a system while hunting requires multiple quick scans. the faster you are at this the better your chances for catching prey/avoiding trouble.in addition, when engaging solo in a crowded place (like amamake), i've generally got my range set to two million kilometers and spamming scan during the fight. this is my only warning if others are warping in... and my only chance of avoiding blobs.perhaps i've missed something. please explain how scanning probes can be utilized by a 'true solo' (single account) rifter seeking targets in amamake.i understand ccp's need for the change. i've seen the graph depicting the before/after server load. but the current fix makes combat more difficult (and solo combat much more difficult).perhaps, if ccp refuses to budge on this, it would be advantageous to develop a new scanner mechanic which cannot be so easily abused yet is able to get important information to the player?"
9/19/2009,"i would like to join one of these csm probing tutorials too lolno question about pickin a crashed carrier in hughe blob fights or lowsex thingys.this leads me to following questions:50 celestial objects in incoming scangrid (letz call it beltz), all beltz are seeded around 360 and one vessel in your directional scanner.1. how long is shortest possible timer, with directional scanner and how high(or low) is it with probing?2. how high is the chance in total to get a tackle with these new features?please note: you dont have to calculate ctrl-q and emergency warp cases.thats math for a, ya i think 10 year old kid and no you dont can do crosses here.do not forget you have directional scanner delay from 2'000 ms.nexttime we do it with aligntimer, warprange (including acceleration and dropping out) scanres, distance from vessel a and vessel b in scangrid from victim vessel b excluding lag, rollbacks and other sexeh features."
9/19/2009,"come on, you know you want it, let your voice be heard and support this thread."
9/19/2009,i think you've just highlighted the two most annoying things about drones.
9/19/2009,"if the infrastructure hub is indeed a modular type station/thingy then yes this is what we are looking however i personally would like to see ccp do a phased conversion of pos's as well and specifically say in info that they do not affect sov. i am also waiting for ccp to post on dominion page as well as put out more dev blogs. would also love to see a dev have an in-game or otherwise conversation with this group as after reading the minutes (admittedly linked ones were from a while ago) it seems like ccp is going with a preference for small, incremental adjustments. i would have no problem with that if we had an idea far in advance of dev/coders 'schedule'. cause while the funny movies at fanfest are great if they are taking away from dev time that is a disservice to your customers. btw this is the first post ever i have made and after playing the game for near two years i can say this topic has my full-hearted support."
9/19/2009,"please read this topic start carefully before replying!a bit of background on this. we (the csm) talked to ccp about sound in eve. ccp is aware of the bugs and has solved many of them already. with the recent hiring of a dedicated sound engineer, they are putting more emphasis on sound development for eve. besides the many problems sound in eve currently has (which you should petition!), eve doesn't really use sound much in a functional manner. that is what this thread is about.so, this thread is not about current problems with sound. if you have problems with sound, create a petition for it!ccp asked the csm if we can give them more ideas for functional sounds in eve - which are sorely lacking at the moment. ofcourse this will not be the only source of ideas for ccp, but they are very interest in what sort of functional sounds are desired by the player base. this thread is here for you to post ideas for better use of sound in eve. while i personally think a lot can be improved for functional sounds, if you have non-functional sound ideas you may post them here too :)again, this thread is not here for current sound bugs/problems! it is here for new ideas on how to better utilize sound in eve!examples of non-functional sounds (often just used to enhance immersion):warping soundatmospheric noisesgun/explosion soundsexamples of functional sounds:the ""docking request accepted"" soundbeing targeted sound"
9/19/2009,"suggestion: notification sound (beep or similar) when receiving a fleet broadcastreceiving a fleet broadcast currently means only a tiny part of an often cluttered user interface lights up and flashes for a second. this makes it very easy to miss. a specific (unique) sound when receiving a fleet broadcast will make it much easier for pilots to recognize when they receive a broadcast.suggestion: warning notification sound when overheated modules are about to breakbeing able to hear when you should toggle overheating off instead of having to watch tiny bars would be a nice improvement. this would have to give a warning before the next cycle burns the module out, so you can deactivate in time.suggestion: warning notification when shield, armor or cap goes below a certain %care should be taken that this doesnt create sound spam when being remote repped and the talk hovers around the threshhold percentage. also could be applied to hull, however since hull tanks are made of fail, there usually isnt much you can do at that point anyway."
9/19/2009,"warning sound when a warp scrambler / disruptor is activated on your ship.distinct warning sounds for other types of ew being activated on your ship.continuous warning sound while modules are overheated, with an indication of the danger level to the damaged modules (e.g. sound changing in pitch as modules receive damage).warning sound when capacitor level drops below 28%.warning sound when a module deactivates without pilot order (e.g. due to not enough cap or mwd deactivating when scrambled or mods deactivating when your ship cloaks, etc.)warning sound for proximity alert when your ship is cloaked and there are other ships within a predefined distance, say 6 km."
9/19/2009,"warning sound when you get nos'es or neuted tooreduce the difference in volume between the quietest and lowdest sound. this is much improved from the past though, with the warp sound finally quieted. but turrets are still loud compared to shield transfer for examplejust about every tactically important event in eve ship combat, there should be a sound for itthere should be some sort of sound notification when you are in a warp bubble. like maybe some sort of not annoying low humming noise? any easy way to tell when you are inside and not inside, would help combat a lot."
9/19/2009,"i think, adding sounds for all these things is gonna clutter the game up too much. i do support the idea of adding more functional sounds though. just not for every single thing that's happening.instead i'd welcome a customizable user interface of some sort. if you look at wow (yaya i know), depending on your role in the group you install some plug ins and get visual notifications of varying intensity of most of the things that are going on.i think graphics can go a long way here, you just need better notifications than a tiny little icon on the very right of your overview, or a blinking red circle around your modules which only increases in 20% steps."
9/19/2009,"as for non-functional sounds, i usually view my ship from a distance of 75km. at that distance, the combat sounds are practically non-existent. that seems to be a regression from the situation prior to apocrypha. now, with apocrypha, one needs to be viewing their ship from about 5km in order to hear much of any combat related sounds. i don't wish to force my preferences upon anyone else, but that change harmed the audio experience. at a minimum, the range at which combat sounds are audible should be configurable.some might think of certain functional sounds as endearing. yet, there are a couple i can do without. they are 1) ""those items are not stackable."" and 2) ""your door is ajar."" (just kidding). number two would be, ""i can't set a waypoint for the same location twice.""i suggested to csm3 member meissa anunthiel that extended trial accounts be offered to the manufacturers of discrete audio cards and audio accessories. not being an audiophile myself, those people might have some better ideas about how eve online could be enhanced to the point that gamers actually wish to acquire rather than remove audio equipment to enhance their game experience. if such manufacturers or vendors can be signed on as sponsors for fanfest 2010, then that will be a sure sign of progress. currently, i don't see that such vendors would see such sponsorship as being of any value.thank you, for progressing this far with the audio concerns."
9/19/2009,"functional sounds:- a sound when someone new comes onto your scanner. (preferally different sounds for corp-members, enemies and unknowns)- a sound when a wreck has been succesfully salvaged.- warning sound when capacitor is getting low. (also a subtle sound to indicate when your capacitor isn't stable)admospheric sounds:- the sound of metal bending when the ship's armor or hull is low.- dopler effect on engine sounds of ships passing by."
9/19/2009,"computer games can only access two of the five senses; sight and sound. given these limitations, it is almost criminal to ignore options which more fully immerse the player into the game world or communicate to him/her what is going on in that world.rather than go through a list, i'm just going to tell you what i want. the professionals at ccp will know, better than i, what can and cannot be done. i want all audio accessible to me no matter how close i'm zoomed into my ship. it is clumsy and irritating to utilize zoomed views to modify what i hear. i want audio to assist me in knowing what is going on. there should be a distinct, brief, immediately identifiable audio cue for any action i take against a target and any action another player takes against me. i should know if someone is scramming me. i should hear hits on my ship's hull (but never on my target's hull). i should hear a multitude of klaxons and alarms as i enter structure. plan it out ccp. sit in a mock battle, close your eyes, and tell me what's happening. when you can do that... you're on the right track. i want audio to assist immersion in the game universe. when i approach a station i want to hear the buzz of background traffic comms. i want to hear more than just ""docking request accepted."" i want to hear station control tell me they have assumed command of my ship for docking maneuvers.in a like manner, if i'm in a ss in the middle of nowhere, i don't want to hear background noise... unless it's the blind hiss of background stellar radiation. use the audio. make me believe i'm in space.i, along with others, did a great deal of brainstorming along these lines on a couple of space sim projects. space is certainly one of the more difficult audio experiences to communicate. but done correctly, the audio can have a massive effect upon immersion. happy to provide more detailed lists if needed. finally, i want the ability to customize what i choose to hear to a high degree. audio cues needed by pvp'ers may just irritate those running missions in empire and vice versa. players must be able to configure these new tools.hope that helps and glad ccp is looking into this most neglected area of the game."
9/19/2009,"the proposal is simple, really. since plexes have been such a success, ccp should add character transfer and portrait change tokens as well that people can buy and trade ingame. with the same ingame restrictions with plexes(such as the inability to remove them from the station).i think that there's an untapped demand for these services from the ""poor irl but rich ingame"" market, and i think it's financially worth the cost of coding in."

9/19/2009,"good idea, bringing this up next meeting :)"
9/19/2009,"i think this has been brought up before, but might as well do it again. given the overall ""no"" replies to training multiple characters on one account, what about being able to queue skills on both characters and have it automatically switch between them? one runs out, other starts training. this would make alts less of a pain in the ass that it is currently. thoughts?"
9/19/2009,"there is nothing unreasonable about this proposal, acctualy good ui improvement but might be difficult to implement since characters on same account arent connected with eachother in any way ingame through some sort of uinever the less, supported"
9/19/2009,there is honestly no drawbacks to this... its legal... within the boundaries and mechanics of the system.it should be implemented.
9/19/2009,"supporting my own idea (yay timer). edit: as for implementation, they are linked by the account name, so the server would know what to train next just by looking at the queues. if you have 3 characters, it could possibly go by which queue has the least time on it."
9/19/2009,nice idea - though it does beg the question - is there room for bigger brackets?
9/19/2009,make em bold for example.. theres lots of ways.
9/19/2009,"i think someone put it simply that neuts could be nerfed to half the effect because of there effect to active tanking.also, reload times are not hard-coded to 10 seconds. there set per module - every amarr pilot knows this.they have only been made to scale with the overloaded duration decrease. eitherway, the reload time specifically isn't a deal breaker, but it would be nice."
9/19/2009,"done and done. i'm not entirely sure about the necessity of the capital nos or the cap booster reload duration change, but the others are excellent ideas on how to increase the utility of active tanking setups."
9/19/2009,"would also like to see a reassessment of the penalties associated with active tanking rigs - one of the benefits of an active tank is supposed to be that you don't suffer the speed/sig penalties associated with a buffer tank. slapping on a nanobot accelerator/aux nano pump kills your speed and is a disincentive to active tanking, especially on blaster boats which need all the speed they can get.it would also be nice if the core defence capacitor safeguard were not stricly inferior to a ccc or smc; the cost difference is meaningless, so it would be good to have a more significant cap use reduction..."
9/19/2009,"a return to active tanking has been one of my pet-peeves for quite some time, so hats off feeling the same way. critique: - the suggested numbers for repairers are far too low. the actual dps an overloaded rep is able to mitigate is more like 30-40% above normal, even if the repairer itself is operating at higher %'s.a single marii on a cruiser is easily overwhelmed by a t1 frigate :(- boosting overheating also does not prevent buffer tanking from being superior in almost all circumstances.- attaching it to overheat only serves to give people with the skill (character and player) an edge over non-heaters. unneccessary distinction.alternative:- increase fitting requirements for all buffer modules by 50% (2 plates rather than 3). actual sacrifice if buffering. already have non-stacking rigs to boost further.- decrease non-logistics fitted rr efficiency by 50%. you want to live? better have local tank to augment up the rr.- increase repair amount on all local modules by 50%+.- increase all npc damage output to compensate (ratters/missions use active to begin with so pure number crunching)together with rigs, heat and decreased buffers this will make the gallente repair bonus worth while again and let hyperions/brutixes do some good again.it will give value to cap warfare and dampening. both of which are outclassed by ecm as rr/buffer is better than local and unless you neut/damp an entire gang it has no effect compared to the jam.the tanked ship will once again have an edge against the one but still fall to the many (no changing that i fear).point is, buffer tanking has such a massive advantage currently that active tanking will only be viable if buffers are decreased and reps increased, especially when rigs are factored in (actives buff rigs stack, buffers do not)."
9/19/2009,what he said
9/19/2009,"comments:- the nos changes seem unnecessary. it seems that in the best case, they become yet another required module to active tank. it is also a huge nerf to the amarr recons.- requiring overheating to make active tanking viable also seems unnecessary. increasing the heat damage seems to work directly against the only situation in which active tanking was actually useful: sustained engagements- your suggestion does nothing about one of the bigger reasons that people don't active tank: it's hell on your fittings- your changes barely change the break even point for when it's better to active tank vs plate/passive tank. more on this below. - you're suggesting boosting cap boosters, yet another required module.i appreciate that you're suggesting improvements to the game, but i'm not sure this is really the right way to go about it. imo any first step would have to address the fittings disparity between plate/passive tanking and active tanking.consider a cyclone (meant to be active tanked). there's two ways you can do it: with a large booster or an xl booster.consider the large booster:large shield booster: 165 grid / 115 cpumed cap booster ii: 165 grid / 25 cpumed nos: 175 grid / 16 cputotal: 505 grid / 156 cpulsb can be overheated for 1:30 for a 660 dps tank once you include cap. your changes would mean that it could overheat for ~1 minute (remember: +100% damage and a faster cycle time, requiring more capacitor and damaging faster) and tank 912 dps.take said cyclone in a fight against a buffered brutix. the brutix deals 830 dps.brutix ttk cyclone: 60+ 29729/(831-517) = 154 seccyclone ttk brutix: 102 sec2 brutix vs 2 cyclonesbrutixs ttk cyclone 1: 29729 / (831*2 - 912) = 42 seccyclones ttk brutix 1: 51 secso even in bcs (which are far and away the most common/likely ""solo"" and ""super small gang"" ships in eve), we see that a second item on the battlefield utterly nullifies active tanking, even when you have an active tank bonus.-liang"
9/19/2009,"instead of overheating, why not require a script?also, double the amount repaired while doubling capacitor use with reduced duration might be ideal. i support the idea of active tank discussion, but the exact details are lacking."
9/19/2009,"not supported. i'll explain why. first, it would be great if we could help (through tutorials) everyone, regardless of their language. i'm a big fan of more new players in the game - eve needs this to be healthy. however, translating the tutorials is not a trivial task (with ever-changing tutorials), and a big question is if you want to have tutorials in language a, while everything else in the game is in language b? assuming we're ok with having specific localized tutorials and spending developer time on it, should spanish be one of those languages? sure it is the fourth (after mandarin, english and hindi) most spoken language in the world - but does this apply to eve as well?this devblog of the most recent csm elections shows that this is not the case. according to the devblog (see the list of voters by country, then % of subscribers), the 10 most spoken languages in eve are:1: english (us + uk + english part of canada (78%) + australia + new zealand) - 58.3%2: german (germany + austria) - 9.39%3: russian (russia) - 5.44%4: french (france + french part of belgium (50%) + french part of canada (22%)) - 3.9%5: dutch (netherlands + dutch part of belgium (50%)) - 2.6%6: danish (denmark) - 2.1%7: swedish (sweden) - 2%8: norwegian (norway) - 1.35%9: finnish (finland) - 1.1%10: polish (poland) - 0.8%in fact, spanish (spain + parts of latin and middle america) is so under represented that none of the top 21 countries speaks spanish. this also shows why only english, german and russian are the officially supported languages.so while spanish is the fourth most spoken language in the world, it is only spoken by an exceedingly small part of the eve population. it would be more likely and reasonable to include a french or dutch or even polish tutorial than it would be include a spanish one."
9/19/2009,"until we see the changes that ccp makes to projectiles and the minmatar ship lineup, i will push this back for everyone to take a stab at it."
9/19/2009,"while i think your point number three is valid and should be passed your larger point about removing term limits i disagree with for two reasons.the first it puts ccp in the position to be accused of playing favorites. whatever their reasons for denying a trip to some and not to others may be, no matter how valid or reasonable those reason really are they will ultimately not be able to escape charges of favoritism in their choices and so are left with either accepting all or rejecting all csm incumbants which negates your system checksecondly there is the question of the delegates themselves let me quote a poster from another section:i think that future csm's are the biggest risk as far as corruption goes, however. they are not required to ""go undercover"" like ccp employees, they are usually alliance leaders, and they are not expected to step down from their ingame positions during their terms, and they cannot lose their job because of whatever they do. that is, they have all the incentive in the world to be corrupt with only the penalty of getting banned if they aren't subtle enough and get caught.returning the same delegates to office repeatedly would seem to increase the risk this poster believes is already existent."
9/19/2009,"to maz's idea i vote no. it is way too complex if nothing else. not to mention the fact that continuity hasnt shown to be a problem so far. from csm3, only 3 pilots will not be able to run again (vuk lau, omber zombie and myself). so there are 6 people who can run again (and i have a feeling at least a few of them will), which ensures continuity - without getting the council to become an 'old boys club' with the same 4 blockvoted players over and over. as tempting as it is to think ""oh dont worry, i'm the right man/woman for the job!"", the csm needs constant fresh blood.and while voting blocks may always get a seat, at least that seat will go to a different person every 2 terms (if not sooner), which has already proven to be a good thing (i wont name names here). not to mention that it is highly dubious to pass an issue (law) that gives yourself more power.while oz's idea has merit, i think it should at least be a 2 term sabbatical. so after serving two terms (either consecutively or not), you'd have to wait a year to run again.as much as i'd like to be chairman for life - i dont think this is a good idea. for maz's idea i'm voting no. omber's idea, adjusted for a 2 term sabbatical period... maybe."

9/19/2009,"no, no, and no.local is a very much needed tool for anybody traveling through low/null-sec. by your logic, that local is a ""concord-provided service"" or whatever, then ccp should also remove stargates from null-sec. no. if it's that important to you to make this a realistic internet spaceship experience, then imagine that the local chat system is integrated into the stargate network.if you want to go somewhere without local chat, go check out wormhole space. that place has no stargates. no communications network. no human-controlled infrastructure or connection to the settled regions of the universe whatsoever. it's also a place that's scary as hell to be in, especially when you launch your probes and find poses all over the place. you never know if you're about to be hot dropped by a cap fleet just for the hell of it. even null-sec is, while lawless, still a controlled area.strongly oppose. so much so that if this plan is implemented, i will cancel my subscription."
9/19/2009,"if the stargates are the ones provideing the information of who is in a system they must have great scanners, to know that a carrier fleet just jumped in. but i like the idea that they are bassically giant bean counters because the jumps are all acounted for in the starmap under jumps in last hour/24 hours etc..that being said soon the new soviernity comes out so the gates will be in control of the players. i think the players owning all the gates in their system should get to choose wether or not they have a local.comments?"

9/19/2009,"this arguement is moot. it's really easy to get around that timer anyways:1. grind faction standing to the point you need in order to access all agents for the chosen faction.2. find a suitable agent.3. cancel any mission you don't desire.4. ignore the warning about standings5. ???6. profitnever the less, i support this idea. i think another option could be to have a list of say 4-5 missions to choose from, and remove the option to reject missions. imo, that's a much better solution."

9/19/2009,"ok so i was in leadership for running a 0.0 alliance. i have had lots of dealing with lots of people.i'd heard lots of stuff about the gms. i've made lots of petitions. generally speaking they have been good and straight forward afaik. 9/10 have led to ""we will close this now and do what we do"" so i cant exactly verify anything.i have heard massive amounts of improper punishments being placed on players.friend who generally trades... got gagged for 24 hours. at around the 25 hour mark... the gm responds saying it was totally inappropriate to gag him and that he will then ungag him... but the gag had already been run out anyway. so he got entirely punished for doing nothing wrong.there are many other situations where gms give bad information... for example. i have >5.0 sec status. someone sees this and petitions to find out how to do it. without asking me. gm responds that it's impossible to have over 5.0 sec as that's the limit. that anyone who has over 5.0 would have to be a gm or an exploiter. the person who originally made the petition probably didnt drop my name but said person. then when i got labelled exploiter. he contacts me saying im an exploiter and he's getting me banned. the result wasnt very good.despite all this. i still hadnt lost hope in the gms.just now broke that for me. i was on sisi... but the cancer levels of sisi are at such high levels. so i start playing red faction guerilla. that starts crapping out. so i get into eve. i post in 1 channel and only 1 channel. ""jitabros pc kronos"" iow someone in jita pricecheck kronos. i never did get a response. 45 mins later i get global account gagged for the reason of ""because jason edwards""this exact thing has happened to so many other people now. gagged for no valid reason.something has to be done to fix this situation.allow public publishing of gm/ccp convos i think will be the first step toward this tbh.you may not publish private communications from ccp, their agents or representatives or eve online volunteers without authorization. this should change. it is without a doubt the cause of such a fog of war of the issue.i think the system has become so poisoned that many people are making bad petitons in protest of the situation... which is what leads to so many more issues."

9/19/2009,"eve is all about balance and for every new offense tactic or module their is a counter tactic or module. today i lost a onyx in 0.0 by a corp that hot dropped no less than 8 carriers on me. although i felt flattered that it took that many to engage and kill me, but, reflecting on my loss i realized why it sometimes is getting harder for real pvp one on one or so. people will not engage if they know they will by hot dropped on. so, how can this be countered?recommendations: 1. a cyno scattering module - once activated in the proximity of a active cyno it randomly scatters the jump destinations to various areas, even in another system. the more ships the more the scattering gets spread out. an ew ship would be the most likely candidate and of course the obligatory drawbacks would have to be applied for balance.2. a mobile cyno jammer that can be fitted on a ship that can block all in coming cynos as long as activated. the mobile cyno jammer could be based on a range of jamming per level. a level 1 can only cyno jam ships that are within 20k were as a level 5 could block and entire system. the drawback would be of course to keep balanced is that this jammer would be a power drain that would not last forever.3. same name as above mobile cyno jammer but instead of blocking incoming cyno ships it prevents ships from leaving as long as active. this way if 9 carriers hot drop into a system for a lone ship or two they may not like the idea of being trapped by a mobile cyno jammmer ship that is calling his friends in.again eve is all about balance and being able to move and counter move. please let me know if this can be improved on.flame away!"

9/19/2009,yeah dropping 8 bil on a t2 cruiser and even killing it doesn't sound really balanced.
9/19/2009,ya hotdropping does need buffs.stupid.i had the same idea. the ship would be limited to say 10 au or something. would be on a capital ship with the equivalent sort of tank and capabilities of a rorqual. would be a siege sort of module. would generate a cynojamming beacon just like cynos create those warpable beacons.yep this same ship would then be able to make it impossible for other ships to jumpdrive out of the system also. more dead caps are great.so since your post wasnt at all related to hotdrops. let me propose some actual hotdrop buffs.- well the old cyno effects need to be done soon. gawd do i ever miss the epicness.- 30 seconds bubble from the cyno @ 25km.the cyno gets popped... even in lowsec. carrier jumps in. then for 30 seconds. there's a bubble created that disallows the carrier or anything within that 25km to warp.

9/19/2009,your idea is even more overpowered than the original posting.
9/19/2009,"""your idea is even more overpowered than the original posting.""im guessing your talking about the serious one about the anchorable bubble's?yes! i totally agree. the diference is that the original post is 90% in favor of ganking and mine has massive potential to be used by carebears and gankers alike but the almost 100km cloaking distance and inabillity to anchor next to stargates tips the scale towards carbears signifficantly and to ""reverse ganking"" would be gankers. it is about buying time and creating safer working condidtions for non agressive players while gankers get possibility of harder to find ss for their command ships and miners get safer places and more warning for their 1/2 billion isk orcas and expensive rourq's. on the flip side this added sence of security could tip the balance to well equiped gankers, feeding off of the sence of security the bubble provides the occupants. some of them possibly afk. as for the cloaking of pos it (as stated) wouldnt be a permanant thing or even as long lasting as other deployables such as disrupter towers etc. making the job of keeping new cloaking bubble's expensive and ungainly it would mostly be useful for putting them up withought them getting detected before they have their defences online. after that if somone were to bm it and go to atack it their bm would be well within the decloaking range and the station would as always be in imeadiate trouble. but even with the idea of a 99km bubble i know an interceptor is more than capable of govering that kind of ground in short order. so yes it is extremely overpowered but in enough ways to cover a broad spectrum of possibilities for gankers and carbearsthe only way to even it out for the gankers would be to make it smaller and make warping from cloaked sites and cloak bubbles impossible until x amount of time after the bubble has colapsed. forcing the poor rourq pilot to watch helplessly as say, an interceptor and covert ops frig systematically scann it down possibly just meters away from decloaking it. so once more i tottally agree with you but open your imagination to all the possibilities of a device like this from all perspectives and instead of just shooting the entire idea down at once do it point by poit so we can see if there is a posibility of a device like this one or the original posters because simaler devices have been used in games like ""homeworld"" with great usefullness. and im not even proposing one like the homworld version which was simaler to the interdictor ships with their mobile bubbles and were used to sneak ships right up to the mothership and decimate the enemy before they had a chance to know what hit them. imo, its the oh no thats overpowered quick grab the nerf gun attitude that is holding this game back. instead of lazilly nerfing the few ships and mods that stand apart from the others why not take the time and bring the stragglers up to par?coments?"
9/19/2009,"i would consider this proposal to be the very definition of overpowered. the fitting of a cloak is supposed to detract from your ship's offensive capabilities, and this is nothing short of a clever workaround.not that i've not wished for it myself on multiple occasions. it even makes sense in a role-playing way: your ship is deploying a 'fuzz-buster' which scatters signals from outside sensors. as long as you stay within range, you're hidden. as a solo small-ship pvp'er, i'd just about kill for one.unfortunately, it offers far too much power to the aggressor. and also removes a very important factor in eve ship design; balance.sorry... can't support."

9/20/2009,"as a carrier pilot, i support this idea. it would of course need to be balanced to ensure that if it is a separate bay it is not just adding capacity to a carriers drone bay.as for all the carrier yes mother... super carrier no people, if only one gets it it should be the super carrier. if you were designing and building a ship that could not dock and a smaller version of this ship you were designing could do it why would you not implement the same feature into it? personally i think both should be able to do it, if anything the moth... super carrier should be able to do it better then the standard carrier.a complex (overly complex and not needed if you ask me but hey a possibility) is that carrier pilots would be able to view a que of all damaged drones/fighters in their bay and prioritize specific drones or fighters either individually or by group (group being fighters, heavy drones, etc.), that is if repairing is not instant. but again overly complex and more sever load... cause we need that :panyways! enough talk... i support."

9/20/2009,"remove the pointless rof nerf on destroyers, fix done. nothing else needs to be done to make them tougher or whatnot.when destroyers were released ships had 60%-ish less armor/shields/hull than they do now (rmr armor boost, and another subsequent one in a later expansion, and new ships always seem to be 'tougher' than the ones that came before).in exodus a destroyer was a credible threat to an inty or af, much more a single t1 frigate tanked or not... and that was [i]with[i] the rof nerf. now a single plated rifter, extended merlin or kestrel, zippy imicus, can laugh while it rips an auto-thrasher or blaster cormorant to ribbons and walks away smiling."
9/20/2009,"when destroyers were first introduced they were two t1 frigs shoved together to make a gun platform, they were not glass cannons, the changes that have occurred in eve since they were introduced has reduced their usefulness in everything except as salvagers.i had some of the most fun pvp i've ever had in zerg dessie fleets, before they were nerfed into uselessness.dessies need some love."
9/20/2009,"not signed.mostly because, as was mentioned before, there's too much of a disparity between console gaming and computer gaming that would give computer gamers the upper hand vs all but very dedicated console gamers.look at games like halo 3: immensely popular despite being console-only. i think ccp knows what they're doing with this one."
9/20/2009,"this is a nice one.difficulties i see on the implementation side, as we already discussed with ccp that bookmarks as well as other settings should be stored server-side. they are on the client currently. and ccp was quite reluctant - in fact they said they cannot do it currently.as a consequence, while i will raise this feature request, i only see a realistic chance of implementation once the server-side storage of settings has been implemented. let's celebrate this on fan fest 2010. ;)"
9/20/2009,"i am thinking that ccp is trying to move away from ""spam clicking"" in general. i cannot think of any other eve activity in which your effectiveness is determined by how rapidly you spamclick a button. well, other than pod warping after ship kill, and that's just to get around ship death lag. rather than ""fixback"" the scanning, i would rather prefer to leave the current scanning system as an antiquated ""what's around me?"" button and apply energies to fixing the ""hunting other ppl"" issue that this scan fix creates."
9/20/2009,"its not just spamclicking a 360 degree directional button. as long as you dont have scripts running doing the spam for you it really took skill correctly using the scanner to quickly find an object in space.people not using the scanner or not knowing how to effectively use it should not post here.soloroaming/scouting has become a real pain and i have not done much pvp since that patch except for the usual ganking-stuff.i seriously hope that there will be some fix to that. reduce delay to 0.1, put in a good substitute (no probing is not, its too fkn slow), whatever... just make it possible again to effectively get a clue on whats going on in the system and where.thanks"

9/20/2009,"functional sounds:- being targeted- being a target of e-war. when capacitor stability, targeting and tracking, propulsion abilities are affected.-when modules get heat damage and when they go off-line-notification when you get message in chat if chat window is minimised.more or less like the blink feature.- notification when concord takes your illegal drugs.- drones receive damagenon-functional:- volleys pounding on the armour and hull.- bumping into big objects with no shield- incoming radio transitions from concord, npc in missions or elsewhere - i guess these can be verbal messages: ""this is officer such and such, i'm taking your illegal 'moonshine'"", ""i'm damsel in distress, save me, save me"". flashing a little avatar and frequency visualisation would make even better.- noise near stations and wormholes, also some sound inside wormhole - radio message from agents when mission is completeand a disable button for all that ))"
9/20/2009,"i'd like to be able to receive random radio-banter when on busy trade-routes and gates and stuff. also it'd be an interesting way of finding hidden things, listen to radio banter and see if any npc is upto something in the system...kinda like listening in on a police radio."

9/20/2009,"not supported. i wouldnt even support this if i was still a pirate.i like how you gave the reason of giving neuts a better chance of killing pirates as they would engage more, but all this is, is giving lazy gatecamping pirates more dps and gankage to kill their targets. find a new day job if you cant hunt your targets."
9/20/2009,"current situation penalizes drone users.what said drone users are doing it irrelevant as they can just come back in something that isnt a droneboat.if anything this change might hurt pies, its fairly common to spam flights of tech 1 drones to distract sentry guns."
9/20/2009,"supported. making drone carriers more capable would make low sec more diverse yes? besides, if a pilot has to take his ship to a station to move drones from cargo holds to drone bay, drones may as well function as a temporary dps boost on gates, like overheating. making ships that rely more on drones for dps then say (insert typical fleet bs here)less capable.and the current aggro system doesn't just effect pirates. it effects anyone who is out in low sec and wants to get some pvp experience."

9/20/2009,support this
9/20/2009,"you mean the info that comes up when you select something in space?that's an intriguing idea. i think it would help people make better tactical decisions. i think ill raise it as a csm issue if there isn't some big reason why this is a bad idea.my thoughts for the system: when a ship is selected, press some key combination to keep the selected info up, but make it look a little different then when you normally select a ship- maybe put a border around it or something. if the ship gets selected again make sure there's a visual indication that it's selected and not just another ship that's being watched.and of course, add a key combination to remove a ship, and another key combination to remove all ships from being watched."
9/20/2009,"yes. i think it can be a bit a less of info - just pilot name and ship type (more info can be shown if this ship is selected).thank you. the point of this idea is to make ""space view"" part of screen more tactical - so fleet commander be able to know, where is enemy ew or tacklers and where his. currently overview allows just distance measurement - not position display relatively to other ships. to do latter, currently you have to move your mouse all around to just know pilot's name and ship type - drawbacks of this is clearly shown in alliance tournament recordings, when to third-party observer there is no understanding which ships are where on battlefield.yes, it is a perfect upgrade of my proposal."
9/20/2009,"you guys are insane they need to remove pilot names from the grid and overview!in empire space and low sec sure, ruin that if you like!! but 0.0 it should be the other way around, where the pro players want to play a hard game."
9/20/2009,no way. how would you know where the celeb or fc is to kill them early?
9/20/2009,"obviously there would need to be an option to turn it off for those times where there are 100 ships on grid but the idea is pretty good.making people jump through ridiculous hoops to do basic things like find out who they're shooting at has nothing to do with '0.0 pro players' (haha jesus christ did you really say that) or a 'hard game', its a basic failing of the ui."

9/20/2009,"not sure if this has been posted in another thread, but i did not see it here and since this discussion is on going with or with out me i may as well chime in.with the changes in dominion remove local from 0.0 by default. then when an alliance controls a system make it an upgrade, deploy something in system, gain access to the sensors from the stargates since you will apparently be paying for their upkeep anyways. if no one controls a system, no local, if some one does then they are the defender and can consider it an advantage. if the upgrade is free and requires no work/cost then every system will have it. but if it requires effort to get, and is something that can be destroyed by an attacking force then hey, cool. hahaha! even better, only let the owning alliance talk i local, most one sided smack talk ever :p something along these lines could really be considered though. maybe only controlling alliance even has access to it, although that seems a tad bit unfair. attacker wondering how many people in local while 200+ people assemble to kill his small 10 man gang.anyways, just an idea."

9/20/2009,"for pos defense modules.using the ships tables from the overview, you can drag ships up or down in the que to set the targeting priority for pos guns.simple, effective, badly needed."
9/20/2009,how will the furthest bits of space be viable for alliances with current logistics its impossible to get there without intermediate points.this means you will either be a pet/renter to get space deep in the universe.to me it looks like the further systems will be rental space for the big alliances that will take the space that is logistically viable.so logistic ships like jump freighters would need to get a huge boost in jump range to be able to get to and from empire for logistics.
9/20/2009,"if they make the cost to construct these guns a bit expensive then they will not unbalance the game, they will be just another service a corp/alliance can offer to its mining divisions. (sort of like a temporary pos) as for the pirates, they will have to adapt and travel in larger numbers and/or adopt new tactics, but they will be rewarded by having a large number of targets in one place that are taking advantage of the protection the guns offer. and once the guns are defeated or tanked then there will be enough rewards on hand to warrant attacks on fortified asteroid fields.i am in favour of this idea."
9/20/2009,this could also provide a slight balance to the nerf ice miners are getting from pos' not being needed for sov anymore.some thought into balancing would be required but i like the basic idea

9/20/2009,"shield transporter transfers shield from your ship to the target, without any/ with very low energy cost, but not 100% efficiency. that way passive tanked ships can remote rep. there could be few types of transporters, the higher th speed of transfer, the lower is efficiency. current modules could be renamed to shield inducers, the will be left the way they are, they use capacitor energy to induce shield on another ship.modules could have similar fitting costs. would help passive tanked ships a lot."
9/20/2009,a shield transporter as it is atm helps passively tanked ships already. rr drake gangs are fun. i dont see a need for a change.
9/20/2009,"pos defenses currently are pointless against drone swarms. indeed, they do not even target them because of past exploits.there needs to be a few new batteries specifically designed to target small stuff.light missile battery (point defense pulse/rail/autocannon):same fitting reqs as a small gun. uses *small* ammo (or light missiles) but targets only drones. damage multipliers in line with other primary systems of the same type.repair:also, pos need a repair facility of some sort. either a passive system that targets ships only within the pos shield and remotely repairs them, or something you put your ship into similar to the maintainance array and select 'repair'.remote repair would only work on one ship at a time with about the same efficiency as a bs fitting four or five remote reppers but spreads it across all areas of the ship (hull, armor, shield) so each area receives the equivalent of one or two large repairers. not terribly fast but far better than nothing. also repairs overheat damage, cargo, and drones after the ship is at 100%."

9/20/2009,"you kill them one by one. start with the later a down to z for example.if you come to pos defence without any rr on your ships, you failed already.nothing will locally tank a fleet that can take down your pos. put one remoterep on each ship you got and you got a pretty hefty rr tank.i hope i helped you to see that the stuff is already there."
9/20/2009,and then we will see all drone boats happily gank people.no.
9/20/2009,"currently, non drone boats gank people, and drone boats don't. so i really don't see the issue with allowing drone boats to do what every other boat can already do in the game?besides of course the ""unique"" factor. i mean, we don't want every ship to be the same, but right now drone boats are sorta crippled against camping, and not to mention moros nerf, we might as well buff something about drones since the suck enough.edit supporting and sort of buff nowadays, especially for drones"
9/20/2009,bonused drones can still survive quite a bit.

9/21/2009,"that's really a hawk issue, tbh. the real problem with rockets is to do with the metagame. rockets are basically ok in terms of the % damage dealt to a webbed, scrambled target - they'll do full damage, or something vaguely close to it. the problem is the ""webbed and scrambled"" bit.it requires that you fit a web, which many frigates don't have the slots to do, and it requires that your frigate target is not afterburning, which many frigates do, particuarly afs. to this you can add low base damage and excessive fittings for that damage.then the hawk suffers even further with a horrible non-caldari shield boost bonus and doubly horrible cpu. all while having less base dps than a kestrel."
9/21/2009,clicking for my support.
9/21/2009,"meh, i'm caldari. just used rockets in a frigate vs frigate tournament in my alliance this past weekend and they did pretty good. only reason i lost, in my opinion, is because i wasn't prepared for ecm and got locked out when the enemy was almost gone.anything that gives me a boost in the game, though, i guess i'll support."

9/21/2009,even this is good enough a reason to revisit this change. and the csm really need to up their game if they don't understand the ramifications this has on more advanced pvp.
9/21/2009,daily bump to address this issue.edit: first on p 56 woot
9/21/2009,everything i have to say has already been said.
9/21/2009,like the idea.
9/21/2009,both good ideas.
9/21/2009,"for those of you that don't know, ccp has a department called internal affairs; ia for short.created following events such as t20 that had a detrimental effect both on players and ccp's image; but mostly the later.its intended function is to ensure that ccp employees are beyond reproach and events like t20 do not occur again.-and its second intended function which is to assure players doesn't occur.all is not well and ia remains an empty suit.events involving ccp staff that damage the company's image and relationship with its customer continue to occur-so far this year we have had controversial issues with scrapheap challenge, a 3rd party forum that is operated by a ccp dev, acting on privileged information available to him outside the context of the game.more recently it was uncovered that members of the isd and bh team were releasing data regarding eve players ip addresses to an unsecured party; allowing them to link eve players to out of game resources. as a result many players now suffer an increased security risk that has thus far lead to at least one known attack. further unknown fallout in game with the release of this private information is expected."
9/21/2009,"if it helps, ia audited all of the csm's accounts, probably multiple times."
9/21/2009,"that time of year eh.even tho i havent been affected by this, its still a huge amount of ***goty and a breach of users privacy."
9/21/2009,"ccp should never agree to release private information to non-employees, regardless of the proposed intention or rational."
9/21/2009,too much stuff like this has been going on over the years with the ip addresses and personal data and it needs to stop.
9/21/2009,someone working on behalf of ccp harvesting ip addresses before passing them onto a third party is a breach of the trust we put in ccp relating to the handling of our private data.this needs to be addressed urgently and publicly and with the full inclusion of the csm.
9/21/2009,top o' the heap
9/21/2009,enable the use of 'sound profiles' similar to the overview settings.atmospheric sounds.warning sounds.weapon effects sounds.no sounds.etc.
9/21/2009,"i recall bacon being delicious...(for those of you who don't remember, bacon was a third-party tool that played audio notifications for enemies entering local. it was incredibly controversial, though to this day i really don't see why - it's information you can see easily, it just gave it to you in a better format.)"
9/21/2009,sure why not
9/21/2009,"very good compromise. i'm all for this idea! props for thinking it thru, mate!"
9/21/2009,agreed. a straight ui improvement is all this is. if it's not too difficult to code then i'd like to see it implemented.
9/21/2009,"if they implemented this and skill injection without requisites, and took the 24 hour cap off, the skill system would be perfect."
9/21/2009,this would be nice
9/21/2009,go go go
9/21/2009,"people keep saying this ""versitile"" stuff but how is it versitile? its damage it mitigated by both the raw speed of its target and its transversal/sig due to the ac/torp split (plus the drones weak points the other three have to also deal with), in practice its damage is normaly lower than a pure gun or torp boat. what makes it versitile? its not the fitting for sure since its grid and cpu are nothing special, could it be the ac's since they suck so hard dropping one or two acs from a phoon is no loss but answer me this which of these is the versitile ship.8 highs 7 turrets each turret has 74 base damage. (each turret saves more fitting than the ship below)8 highs 4 turrets each with 58 base dps and 4 launchers each with 92 dps.having 4 **** weapons is not versitility, having weapons with more complex engagement envelopes is not versitity and you can fit neuts/rr to any bs gunship in the game, a high with a turret>high without a turret."
9/21/2009,don like the tempest change. loss of alpha strike and dps is too bad.change to 10% damage per level and we can talk.... that woudl make it a snipar!
9/21/2009,"read the op before you post, thank you."
9/21/2009,"poor troll attempt. minmatar rely almost exclusively in pvp on our opponents' lack of understanding of how minmatar actually works. which is a horrible system to have to fall back upon. it's a pretty sad state of affairs when it just plain makes more sense to fly battlecruisers as a matari and let the battleships sit and collect dust, because they are such underwhelming performers.as to pattern, i'm not sold that this will fix it, but at this point any matari love is better than none at all. supported."
9/21/2009,"my my pattern clarc, i appreciate your penchant for name calling and personal attacks. it really adds a lot of weight to your arguments to immediately start insulting and personally attacking your ""opponents"" who rightfully point out flaws in what you've said. now, on to respond to the rest of your comments:re: ""overboosting""nowhere have i said that i want an overpowered tempest. in fact, i think if you had bothered to search over my posting history or know anything about what i have asked for, you'd know that i do not want any particular ship or race to be overpowered. in fact, i'd really appreciate a bit less of the ""round-robin"" balancing approach that ccp seems to have taken a liking to.re: your posting styleyour post is almost incomprehensible because it's simply a rapid fire set of responses to responses. can you please give some idea of just what topic you're responding to when you respond?re: void/hail- fixing void has nothing to do with fixing minmatar, and it isn't even a major balancing point. furthermore, your changes to void do not really go far enough to make it a useful ammo over fed antimatter.- your ""fix"" for hail does not address that it is an utterly inferior ammo. it is virtually never a good idea to use hail l when not fighting capital ships because of the other penalties. cap penalty be damned - you can't outdamage rf emp even with the extra base damage. note that this will apply to void above as well.- there is no reason to tackle void individually from other t2 close range ammo.re: vargur and artillery- the vargur already has a role bonus. it doesn't need *two* role bonuses. so either fix the fitting on the vargur itself, or ""fix"" the fitting on artillery.- yes, the paladin can fit 4 tach iis and have room for a faction lar. this is an immaterial fact to this discussion, because the paladin does not have a second role bonus.re: phoon's 6th launcher- yes, a 6 launcher rr fleet phoon would be less unwieldy.- yes, a 6 launcher rr fleet phoon would utterly invalidate the raven. this is a point that you have repeatedly neglected to address.re: the maelstrom- i was simply stating that the maelstrom is already the minmatar main fleet bs - so there's no change to be had because of the new 1650s.... continued ...-lianged: shifting stuff about."
9/21/2009,"re: tempest, painter ew bs, support roles, and the zealot.- my mistake on the range of the painter. however, at 112+60km, it's still effectively a useless bonus to have on a sniper bs.- anti-support is not a bs role. while i might appreciate it, i think a better solution would have been a raw tracking bonus instead of a painter bonus (think muninn). yes, the painter would be nice to any torp ravens you had in gang with you, but it won't be changing that your dps is much lower than it used to be - and in fact is much lower than any bs sans the scorp!- the zealot will have better effective dps because it has a much higher sig res - which translates directly into more effective dps.- the zealot will have much better agility than your proposed 4 low slot tempest. your proposed tempest will not be able to keep up with fast moving hac gangs, which is the only place that it might have been an actual asset.- your tempest takes the already anemic damage from autocannons and lowers it even more - with no return.- your tempest takes the already anemic alpha from artillery, and lowers it even more. what's more, is that it lowers the overall damage output and increases the ammount of ammo that you'll use. all of this for no return.- your tempest won't be able to take part in rr armor bs gangs with only 4 lows, and it won't take part in rr shield bs gangs because they don't (and won't) exist..- your tempest won't be soloing because it has *even less* agility and dps than it does now. both things that are sorely lacking.- your tempest changes are terrible. it's not just ""not boosting to over 9000"", it's a direct slap-in-the-face nerf!re: ""not fixing the guns"", racial flavor, and ac falloff- hit chance also affects hit quality. this is one of the key problems with projectiles. this trivializes the ""range advantages"".- projectiles have drastically lower amounts of actual damage on the ammo than the other races. this trivializes ""damage type selection""- there is a module called a ""cap booster"" which is a required module to fit which trivializes cap use. this trivializes ""caplessness"".- (i think we agree on the above three items)- high optimal autocannons might help alleviate some of the painful damage reduction that we see, but it would utterly eliminate the racial ""flavor"" of minmatar - that they operate in falloff. they would simply become carbon copies of blasters, just with higher optimal and falloff. i would say that it's ok to see high falloff weapons in the same sense that it's ok to see high optimal weapons.- increasing tracking on artillery is a welcome change, but doesn't change the fact that they're essentially useless in fleet combat. as you said: tracking generally becomes a non-issue once everyone's at 200km.- increasing clip size by 20% is just this side of a useless boost. fleet utility is calculated in terms of ehp and dps - and in the average case you seem content to very very minor increases in dps (a slight tracking boost and a very slight clip size boost). really, this fix is more of a nod to that it's incredibly frustrating to reload that often and lose that much dps than a fix for the problem.- the 1650 artillery sounds like a really great idea until you read the subtext. alpha as it is presently known is simply not a viable mechanic in this day and age. it would take a really big increase in alpha to make it viable. which is really the core of astro's suggestion: higher alpha at the cost of overall dps. sure, it's not good for fleet snipers, but it really excels where artillery is presently passable (smaller gangs).- the other weapon types (especially lasers, atm) have answers for any advantage that projectiles might have brought to the table. your changes help mitigate some of this, but these problems should probably be addressed at the root before they are addressed by radically changing the way projectiles work.-liang"
9/21/2009,"i definitely like some of the ideas, but 50% to tp optimal per lvl would be the most useless bonus in the game."
9/21/2009,"can't other bs rr? what breaks a gate camp? it isn't the guns. it is a larger fleet, or real life issues. perhaps make smart bombs not hit stargates and turrets would balance it out a bit better.i actually think this would be a nerf, because drones are used in gate camps as damage soakers. low sec needs more incentives. i'd love to have some of the low grade null roids to be there. definately not mercoxit."
9/21/2009,"just occurred to me, that sentries don't even do their jobs. once an aggressor has maxed the sentry fire it's all rrgang blob. sentries don't even call in backup.needed lowsec sentry changes:3. 1 sentry will now capacitor drain over time. will also randomly switch targets to aggressing ships.4. increase # of cap-draining sentries and intensity of drain, faster target changes.5. concord is spawned after 4 hours to defend their property. bottlenecking non-sovereign space, with blobs is not good for gameplay.rr camps are getting annoying. every [worthy] pilot has it skilled and bss can ignore sentry fire in groups so easily.i see this as a boost to: -lowsec population and thouroughfare-more people will expect to be able to run small camps, and will find capacitor-fitted bcs/bss/logistics to fight.-talented fleet management-an active fleet should be able to hold a gate without losing members for quite awhile, but they will eventually be driven back.(assuming people still live in crappy lowsec) -and energy xfer array market share will rise. the skilltree will be trainednerf to: -talentless, lazy, nublet-ganking, perma-gatecamping.and also drones are pirate damage-sinks when used correctly in idle mode. no real pirate would want that gone.lusulpher, noticing gameplay flaws since he finally read the forums.

9/21/2009,"too many options, and i dont think it is correct to have this changed by just csm-3.i think its too soon, there were yet just 3 terms in council of wich many did their second term now.lets wait another 3 extra counsils..."
9/21/2009,"messy. wasted votes. what if you're on the fence about two candidates, one of which may end up being disqualified after the votes are tallied? that's an unclean solution to something that i don't even see as a problem. not supported - keep the term limits.absolutely not supported. the csm delegates are accountable to the player base. i do not like the idea of ccp, the entity that the csm was intended to be a balance on, having the power to simply veto somebody because they didn't like the work they did.significant reform is needed in this area. from what i remember, issler wasn't even aware that he (she?) had been put on the csm until the devblog was published (source). she was never given an opportunity to say no. that rather absurd.edit!one further point. i am rather disturbed by this part of your comment:that seems like a broken mechanic. the duration of your term is spent not in iceland. i understand that having you lot in a room with some game designers is efficient, but this indicates to me that you lot haven't got any ears or pull for the rest of your term?not to go veering off topic, but does csm <=> ccp communication (and action) need some improvement?"
9/21/2009,"if they are good, they should be allowed to stay for as long as people vote for them. i support this.it means people like vuk can stay on for a long time, but it also means poorer former csm members (like ankhesentapemkah) can re-apply.oh well."
9/21/2009,this is a good way to implement it and fits in with the purpose of rigs too.
9/21/2009,"the reason is simple: twits in moros sitting dead on stations in lowsec, completely unassailable, cranking out near capital ship damage from drones that can hit sub-capitals for full damage which is something no other capital, not even carriers, can do.about damn time imo, and i'll sit back and laugh at the ****ing station huggers while they weep."
9/21/2009,"supported!and it needs a 7.5% or so damage bonus instead of just 5%, to bring it in line with the other dreads. even if it was left unchanged, it would still be quite worse than other dreads in tasks such as sniping. or just give it a huge sentry drone optimal range bonus. that works too!"
9/21/2009,"whoa, they are deagressed, if they log/dc and get time to think about dying, fine, as long as they didn't fire on/kill you they should not be scannable or scrammable. but hit them with stacking time penalties for multiple intel relog.if they aggressed, ship scannable for 15mins, no invincibility. period. they chalk that dc up as a loss if the enemy brought probes. if they don't relog in 15, they don't get to relog for an hour, they need to fix their connection anyway.relog, relog, relog, safety , that's an exploit.support for relog fix. which is simply, make sure e-warp 1 has to complete before e-warp 2. no hop-scotching through space while seeing enemy force and being invulnerable."
9/21/2009,i fully support this idea. all other alternative idea posters in this thread can shove it.
9/21/2009,"logoffski needs to be tended to. a ship that disconnects in any way should:1. be scrammable and not ignore scrams (as they sometimes do when logoffski during gate-cloak)2. not disappear from space if they are agressed (ie you are being scrammed or shot at)3. warp to a safespot 1 mil km away and nowhere else regardless of amounts of login/logouts and always warp back to the exact same spot they left if you log back in (even if you instantly log out again. you simply land in your original location and then the game initiates a new emergency warp, with align and all that jazz).this would lead to that a logoffski that is agressed is screwed regardless. a logoffski that does get away has no way of warping to several spots. a logffski that logs off and on and off in order to make a new warp will find himself back at the origin point (pirates or whatever) before doing another align and warp.that would solve it for logoffskis without hurting people that legitimately disconnect or log off in space for the end of a gaming session.thoughts?"
9/21/2009,"2 things, first its a bit hypocritical to raise this as an issue just because you missed your titan kills, and second what happens when you've logged off in a pos in 0.0, and due to rl stuff/whatever you log back on after 2-3 days and the friendly pos has being replaced with a hostile pos? how in any way is it ""fair"" to the person who logs back on to not be able of taking any other action but being warped to the spot he logged off? the warp-to-safe and disappear exists since this is a game and people should (and/or) have a life outside of it."
9/21/2009,"erm if you'd taken the time to read the thread you'd understand the fact that this is an exploit as it makes your ship immortal, so firstly we didn't miss the titan kills we denied them by a flaw within the games design.secondly if you log off in a 1-2 bill ""destroyable"" pos in space while in a 70 bill ship your an idiot, any decent titan pilot has a) alot of friends, b) sov 4 c) warps to an off grid 300+au safe to log off.eve is not fair it is cruel get over it, 2 titans should of died but they didn't because they choose to start use an exploit that they know is a ""grey area"" with ccp, thus will do nothing.hence forth we are trying give them an easy programming solution that will fix the problem so that logging off wont make you teleport around while being immortal.so i understand that being moronic may fall hand in hand with people who sympathise with blatant cheaters, however all i've asked for is reasonable why make a big deal against it hmm?"
9/21/2009,supported. this should've been called an exploit long ago.
9/21/2009,"reposting this from here, i suppose i should have posted this thread in the assembly hall to begin with.overheating is the catalyst to my decision to make this post. overheating is great, i love it, and it represents superb content.but the interface for overheating is cludgy and irritating - in short it is poorly designed.here some of the problems:~ the little button to overheat a specific module is small, making it easy to missclick during a fight. ~ the activation light is green, the same color as the glow of a normally activated module, making it somewhat counter intuitive to determine whether a module is overheating or not.~ the green light which indicates an overheating module does not turn on until the module begins a fresh cycle with overheat enabled. this, paired with the small and easy to missclick nature of the overheating button, makes it difficult to tell whether you have actually overheated a module prior to the module starting a fresh cycle. you may missclick the overheat button, and not realize it until the module begins a fresh cycle.~ the heat damage measurement is visually ambiguous. perhaps this is intentional, yet moving the mouse over a damaged module displays a precise % of damage, while the visual meter represents only an ambiguous measurement. this is irritating, and makes overheating even more finicky.proposed solutions:~ we really need a modular hud. this has been a long time coming. a more complicated hud (grouping, overheating, etc.) only makes the current, restricted hud system even more restrictive. the current hud is simplistic and frustrating, making it modular would help rectify this. ~ the user should be allowed to choose the color indications for module activity (currently green), imminent module deactivation (currently red), module overheat (currently a small green light), and module damage (the ambiguous red ring). if a user could change the overheat indication light to, say, purple, the hud would be a lot less frustrating off the bat.~ the user should be capable of choosing the nature of function buttons such as overheating. for example, allow the user to assign a full module-sized slot on the hud to the ""overheat"" function, assigning it to a specific mod. a seperate, full sized button for the overheat function would remove ambiguity, and make it easier to tell what is going on.~ allow the user to determine the size of the module buttons. some people might want them smaller and low profile, others might want them three times their current size. others yet, may wish to change the size depending on the fitting and activity which they are engaged in.~ create a more user friendly hotkey-assignment system. we should be able to quickly and easily assign hotkeys to, for example, overheat the module in the f1 slot.~ give the user control over all of the readouts, in their entirety. we can choose to have numerical absolute and % readouts for shield, armor, and hull hitpoints, why not for module heat damage, or rack heat buildup? ~ make it possible for a player to change module notifications to suit their taste. the little light currently used to indicate overheat, could be reassigned at will to indicate module activation. the green/red rings currently used to indicate activation could be reassigned to indicate overheating. the user could choose to have a color overlay instead, in the color of their choice (hot pink anyone?). the user could adjust their hud to taste to insure clarity and ease of use in this regards.that's about all i've got. what do you think?"
9/21/2009,just replying to give these ideas a thumbs up. particularly the point about having a less ambiguous indicator of whether a module is overheating.
9/21/2009,just wanted to dump in my ideas on this from a year ago.linkage-cj

9/21/2009,"inspired by an irc rant by my greatest fan, go maz, i'm going to post this thread and see what complaints there are right now about contracts.here's what i got so far:-100 item arbitrary limit-no easy way to tell if you are at 100 items or not yet, until after you do the time consuming part oh entering a lot of items. same with damaged items-when you sort by quantity in the contract window, items with stacks of 1 and assembled/damaged items all show a quantity of 1"
9/21/2009,"ammo being removed from guns when you contract a ship - allow ammo to be removed from guns, but added to the same contract as separate items.broken crystals making it impossible to contract any amarr ship larger than a cruiser - give option to remove damaged items from a container during the contract process.no warning (contracts button flash?) given to contractor when a courier contract is completed successfullymainly the damaged items one and the # of items limit without any warning of how many items you've actually added are the most annoying."
9/21/2009,i hate trying to contract hulks and forgetting i had cystals loaded... having to jump 514 systems back to fix that sucks
9/21/2009,"courier contracts can't be ""split"" into smaller and more manageable containers. +1 for the contracting damaged crystals idea; they should automatically be removed from the contract!"
9/21/2009,"yes. and for the love of pete, let me disable that stupid ""are you sure you want to cancel the contract?"" dialog box; it's terribly annoying, especially when i accidentally click on the ""create contract"" button.and please don't tell me that eve is a cold harsh place and that i should see that stupid dialog all the time because it's harsh and cold."
9/21/2009,so i can contract my frigate? size is irrelevant.
9/21/2009,"actually it's not, because you can put anything under 120km^3 into a courier contract (which doesn't care if the mods / crystals are damaged) and then break the contract package"
9/21/2009,hmmm i didn't think of it that way. fair enough.
9/21/2009,you can do the same with cruisers/hacs.bc and above you cant.
9/21/2009,"great idea as long as (a) constellation chat replaces it, and (b) directional scanner is beefed up."
9/21/2009,"i'm pretty sure what i stated was that the rig patch made no sense based on the claims that it would help balance rich vs poor.i've furthermore provided statistical evidence that my claims on the economics behind their change based on their stats and everyone's assumptions were wrong, but we are merely at the midpoint of what i was preaching... i was just building up the platform for 3 months from now when i revist the market stats once more.the point i made, and will continue to make is that by making rigs availible to everyone, the only real change is a loss in diversity of ships. now as predicted, ships have become less uncertain to gauge before a fight because you can be certain they have rigs rather than need to guess.furthermore, for those who claim it was an issue of weath, i've attempted to show just how the faction markets were impacted by the rig changes. i would love to have a statistical analysis of how much more faction loot has been purchased per player since the change, but for now, i can simply go off price.rigs didn't help anyone out. can you fly a frigate better, absolutely, but the standard of fit for every frigate has been raised, not just you personally. about the only impact this has had positively is the balance of frigate vs bs in combat. but when comparing similar class warfare, it's deteriorated. there is no longer as wide a gap between potential as their once was. ===============if ccp wanted to achieve more balance while not doing everything i've and apparently at least a few others have fought against, they could have made all small medium and large rigs available to all ships, but with diminished bonuses and cost for smalls. that would have lowered the gap, but also the reward for spending less, similar to the meta scale for gear currently in game. it's hilarious when people always toss out the money arguement to me in game. i've never met a player yet who couldn't fit rigs pre-patch if they so desired, with 2 or 3 exceptions that were extraordinarily overpriced due to demand. it was a choice of performance vs economics, which is exactly how it should be. if that's not the case, should we remove tech 2's distinct advantages next and reduce the cost so that everyone can afford a zealot or nighthawk?or for that matter, should we remove meta levels so that all new players can afford the best neutron blasters and solace large rr's for their mega?============i've accepted the changes at this point because their's obviously not any going back. all my aim is now, is to show the mistake it's created so that in the future, maybe just maybe the dev's will actually think something through more than their 30 minute brainstorming sessions they apparently currently use. but then again, we have the new dd changes, so my hope is diminished."
9/21/2009,stop being a damn drama queen.get over yourself.the patch has not broken the game... rigs are now a little more affordable... and making the game more challenging is not going to ruin your already overweight ego.seriously... give it up already.
9/21/2009,"yaay,you are missing the point, rigs were implemented incorrectly in the first place and this was the fix. every other t1 or t2 module in the game that can fit multiple sized ships was priced low because the components to build it were few and common. hardeners, rechargers, weapon mods, ewar, the list goes on and on, they are all cheap. when rigs were introduced the opposite was done, the components were many and harder to come by. the result was that rigs were priced higher and were not cost effective to use below the bs level.now they could have fixed this two ways, the first being what they did already. the second would be to convert completely to the model that i mentioned above, the existing model of one size fits all equals cheap. imo that would be worse because it would mean bs's could fit triple trimarks for around 5m isk. so lets be glad they did what they did in this case.the rig market has a solid ""build cost"" floor for prices. sometimes people will sell below the floor to get money now but they do so at a loss. in general this market is controlled by cost. the faction market on the other hand is 100% supply and demand, there are no hard line costs for the top or bottom. any price increases you've seen there would have to be due to an increase in demand or decrease in supply. the change in rig prices could certainly be responsible for people having extra cash to burn now but that's not a bad thing, in fact it was the point."
9/21/2009,"this weekend was the perfect(in my unbiased opinion) end to a great alliance tournament. but there were a few things that could be done better. so let's figure out what those things are in this thread.-------------the biggest issue for me was the visuals. most of the time what you saw on the screen was pretty ships shooting each other. important information like where they were going and who they were shooting was not always very clearly conveyed. due to the nature of trying to communicate something 3d on a 2d format, it's going to be difficult regardless of whatever technique you use to try to show this information. one improvement i can think of is giving the commentators the ability to draw on the screen, much like they do in american football to show what's going on. i remember a few moments in the tournament that were absolutely golden but never mentioned in the commentary, and probably not apparent to people unless it was highlighted. for example when the camera was centering around some pretty ship shooting another pretty ship, a blue square in the background was approaching a wreck. or when my alliance's ****train minmatar fleet was charging the opponent in the semifinals, you could see one ship getting in their way and visibly getting shoved out.my point is, the commentators should be commenting more on what we the viewers are actually seeing. not just on the damage bars and what ships are generally used for doing what. or saying that this or that team are looting wrecks or something, when we can't see it. there is little value in a visual stream when the visuals are meaningless.--------------------team leaders should be given the option to concede the match and keep their remaining ships. there isn't really any good purpose for dragging out matches longer then they need to and right now, players have no incentive not to. i don't think it will impact the fairness of the tournament but it will increase the production value.--------------------ccp need to get advertisers onboard the next time around. you already have a ton of people watching, and they are going to tolerate seeing commercials instead of an animation of a red flag. i know the tourney costs you a lot of money, and putting dish soap advertisements or something on isn't going to drive us away. it will definitely increase the odds of there being another tourney the next year too.---------------------------there needs to be some thing to encourage people to stop using the same general setup over and over again. usually the setups were 2 battleships, 1-3 battlecruisers, a logistics, maybe a couple recons or t3 cruiser, and maybe small ships to fill out 10 slots. i dont know if it was a lack of imagination or a fear of taking risks, but things honestly didnt heat up until the very last matches.maybe we should ban logistics ships and t3 cruisers with logi setups, tracking disruptors, and jamming.----------------------------you guys should show action replays of exciting moments of the matchand you guys should also release the studio commentary along with the matches on youtube. people want to hear what they say about their alliance in the studio between matches if they missed it. i know i would."
9/21/2009,"as far as the rules go, they were much better than last year and i almost wish they stay the same. the 1 glaring ship that's the most used is the logistics ship. it's really quite pivotal, and can skew what should be very close matches pretty badly when both sides get down to roughly the same amount of ships. but i'm not sure how to counter this, and i think that i'd just leave it in, and chalk it up as it exemplifying one of the 2 basic things in pvp, 1 of which is doing dps, and the other, tanking that dps. it should be mentioned that there were some extremely good setups without any logistics, whether or not they were fielded.as far as points go, t3 need to be 1 or 2 points more, bs need to be cheaper (they were so horrible in most cases, this time around), although faction bs may need to stay high, with the massive buffs they're getting. but having t1 bs/t3 at 17 points would make for some really hard choices, as well as moving cruisers to 9 points, and bombers maybe to 7-8, because the more you encourage the use of bs, the more valuable a bomber will be.all in all, i think nobody really got a monopoly on setups this year. even pl's setup is easily countered; the speed/gank team is rather resilient to most things, including bombers/damps, and tbh that's fine. to really be able to counter that, you should have to go to really specialized setups, and that's what we saw.so ccp claw should prolly just adjust points for a few ships to change things up a bit, and keep the basic rules the same, and that should provide a very entertaining tourney for next year. maybe even allow boosters? that would be very, very interesting, though there are some sick combinations of boosters, then again i guess most of those revolve around bs"
9/21/2009,system for applying for tournament was utterly ******ed.
9/21/2009,"i think a couple of good ideas were discussed by the commentators:* more granularity in points: it would be useful to make smaller distinctions between ship classes, such as the points for t1 cruisers and tier 1 battle cruisers* more (but still limited) number of same ships to be flown: i think raising the number of ships allowed to 3 or perhaps 4 per ship type would allow more 'specialist' setups to be created, creating more diversity in successful tactics, while still not making the entire team look the samepersonally i also dislike the use of ecm in the tournament because of the chance base factor. some teams got a number of lucky jams and went through while others didn't and failcascaded. perhaps the randomness of it is fun to some, but i think it makes judging pilot and fc skill very difficult. something that would make the ecm ships and modules less pervasive in the tournament would be much appreciated (perhaps by buffing other racial ewar?)."
9/21/2009,"these are part of tq pvp. strongly disagree with this.allowing 3x ship hulls to open up more varied setups (eg drone setups) would be nice, along with fixing the hac and cruiser points cost to something more reasonable."
9/21/2009,"yes, it was the best alliance tournament so far, but some things could use improvement.i'd like to see more alliances in the tournament, and maybe some way to differentiate or prohibit the sale of slots; just because you own space that is safer than motsu or 1.0 newbie starter system doesn't mean that you should get automatically in.cruiser point cost must also get ajusted.from the commentators pov, i'd like to see more profesionalism, this tournament was a big step up in that aspect because of the presence of kil2. let's be frank about this, you don't want as a commentator an alliance grunt who only flies in fleets, because he doesn't know all of the ships classes, effects, or fits ... nor do you want someone who flies only 1 race.there should be a ban on personal opinions for commentators, i don't think i need to give examples, there has been enough typing about it.i am all for for the option to concede the match.there needs to be better advertisement. i liked how fast the vids from the fights ended up on youtube in hd. so mad props to ccp for that.whatever you do mazzilliu, you will never be able to stop ppl from using the fotm. so whatever the general all purpose setup for the next tournament will be, that is what will be fotm. i think this tournament end showed how fotm played less of a crucial role. most of the teams switched and adjusted setups in the last few matches.compared to the last year there were more nail-biting fights too. :)under no circumstance ban logistics, but the rule of having only 1 ship with rr was a very nice ideea. :)"
9/21/2009,"i was pretty happy with the rules, just points costs need to be adjusted - bombers, cruisers, faction cruisers, hacs etc"
9/21/2009,"i end up saying this after every tourney but they could really do some simple things to increase the information viewers get (particularly now we have the hd stream and the text is readable).- ew icons by each target bracket showing which ships are successfully jammed / dampened / tded / webed / scrambled / nosed / neuted- velocities displayed & some simple measurment of position (eg. distance from centre marker)- leave target brackets of dead ships on screen for a bit so we can see what it was that just died suddenly- maybe other icons like weapons / drones / remote reps / transporters / energy xfers if it can be done without it looking too cluttered- match timer, and ship point counts destroyed so far - full alliance name given once on each side, then get rid of the tickers by each shipthe red & blue bars were a great addition this time but for many matches they weren't on.this stuff would help not only viewers but especially the commentators. it was much better this time but in past tourneys it got really frustrating when they'd wonder outloud why a team had given up trying to do any damage to the other, or had bad discipline cos it wasn't focusing fire, when it was obvious they were all jammed or damped. i don't blame the commentators, they gotta talk constantly so they can't be expected to think too hard at the same time they need visual cues to what's going on, and the ew icons plus ranges etc.. would help them pick camera targets/angles better too (several of them mentioned that it was hard to get good spatial information in tournament mode ui)."
9/21/2009,"in a way alliance tournament slots - 64 so far, can be compared to a rare commodity. more and more ppl join the game, more and more alliances are made, the alliance today is something a solo motsu lvl 4 mission runner can have personally while 2yrs ago the appearance of a new alliance was almost immediately noticed.one alternative to all of this is to increase the cost of getting in, which is something that i think they tried this year, but still, so many alliances joined that it was still close to 50:50 to get in. just increasing the cost next year won't solve the problem, because it will just increase the problem that is the making of alt alliances and applying with all of them to get in.the only viable alternative to this is to increase the entry slots to 128, add another week to the tournament and get a few extra commentators for the coverage - off-c this might also mean that the quality of commentators might go down."
9/21/2009,certain ships are used almost as by default:t3 cruisers (tengu)rooklogistics (although the choice between a tank or a rep logistics makes it not so bad).this could be lack of creativity but also a to low point cost especially for the t3 cruisers this seems to be the case.bs are to expensive especially t3 active tank but this could be a general pvp balance issue between active and passive tank (maelstrom).get rid of the commentators they are awful hardly any relevant comment is coming from them.also show more shots where we can see the relative positions of the ships to each other. i know that hurricanes are awesome.
9/21/2009,the informations were too repetitive like brooke shields colgate commercial on youtube.soveregnity system - same informations several times per day both saturday and sunday.same old crap videos.the last videos were again same stuff that was already told before.the worst part its same stuff from devblogs.i dont blame the eve -tv team couse its not their fault . im blaming the people who were in charge to approve the content couse they should approve more variations and dont restrict the eve tv team that much. the result is it was good team with crappy content.
9/21/2009,"present:the one logistics only rule made a lot of difference, they can be good but not more.ship hull limit also did a world of good, much more variety.future:spatial awareness for the viewers is non-existent as mentioned. definitely something to look into.make a hard limit based on race/faction. as much as the all minmatar, amarr, caldari teams can be fun to watch they decrease variety. cap it at 3 ships from any race and/or 3 faction ships."
9/21/2009,"tbh, there isn't much that needs to be changed about this tourney, but there is a few things.- find some way to get extra funding for the tourney so that we can ditch the radio coverage. this is 2009 and having to listen to the tourney via radio is not acceptable. ads are fine, or even charge people to watch a stream during the qualifiers.- the random entry system is total garbage. if there is no other alternative, then just go back to first come first served. it shows the team's dedication to entry if they apply really early, and any screwups that occur (like mm in tourney 6) are not ccp's fault. to add to that point, the way ccp claw changed the entry rules with only days to go is not good. he failed to predict the mass withdrawals of alliances that gained entry and as a result had to create an emergency second reserve list. this is another reason to ditch the random system.- commentators need more tools to work with. some suggested being able to draw on screen, i think that is a great idea.- points need adjusting. not really t1 cruisers, as this tournament is not about throwaway ships, but maybe lower hac points and increase t3 cost. i also think faction battleships need a points reduction.- ban faction ammo. regardless of how much isk your team has access too, faction ammo is a complete rip-off and often costs more than the ships themselves."
9/21/2009,"a couple of points from me:maybe have a playback option for each match, in a similar fashion as guildwars has implemented into their game. (link)if that is totally not feasible, which i doubt, although it might divert ccp resources away from actually improving the game. how about having a small, stand alone tool, that will show the positions within the arena of each ship during the match? that must be some really basic 3d geometry information for each participant and there must be loads of ""amateur"" programmers who can make a good looking tool for something like this. especially if there is some knowledge on what positions corresponds to what type of ship at what point in time etc. this tool could be used in a small corner of the eve tv video's, so that it will show current fleet positions relative to each other.something that might make it easier to grasp what's happening: have a structure close to the arena, so that people can use that as reference to the actual arena. the structure obviously should be outside of the arena walls though. some people suggested the arena to be close to a planet, but i don't think that'll improve referentiality.and maybe a more fine-tuned point distribution list for ships. i.e. max of 1000, with bs being <U+FFFD>180 points, instead of 18. (shamelessly stolen from some other idea thread somewhere, can't recall where.)all in all i did enjoy the tournament, and although i somehow agree with this being 2009 and eve tv would probably be a good idea to have in both qualifier rounds, i did enjoy the radio commentary. bear in mind though, that radio commentary is very different from tv commentary, and the two qualifier-weekends were done through radio, but with the knowledge that the matches would be shown on video too. would be nice to have a proper radio-amateur with knowledge of eve pvp be involved in the first two weekends and see how that worked out."
9/21/2009,"the commentating was sub par.in some cases it was clear the individual didn't know what they were talking about.edit: is there a reason spectators cant be allowed on grid, but muted in local and with the ability to convo people blocked?1000 immobile pods on a reinforced node isn't going to effect competitors in terms of lag, and pods marking the play boundary would look rather cool."
9/21/2009,"quoted for hilarity. i have flown a logistics for a few weeks. it is really silly that i get gcc when i rep people that don't have it. a quick question, if i rep someone that has a security status of 1.0 that has gcc, do i get gcc then? i'd assume yes, why not just keep that mechanic. you rep someone with gcc, you get gcc, and the same sec status hit they get. its bad enough that if you fly a logistics you don't get on the killmail."
9/21/2009,i agree :)
9/21/2009,you are just to lazy to rat.just to check if someone attacks a blinky he can be rr'ed without taking a gcc? basicly allowing you to aid an outlaw against a +sec pilot without a gcc. need less of this no-agression rr stupidity not more.
9/21/2009,massive support. if you rep an outlaw you shouldn't incurr a gcc unless he currently has a gcc. repping an outlaw should however work the same way as repping anyone else = agressed towards any people he is agressed to.
9/21/2009,"i'd love to see this, primarily for rp reasons but also because diversity is good, and factional ships provide nice shiny toys, and (if made available solely through fw) have the added benefit of fostering pvp."
9/21/2009,"the number of characters allowed per bio is stupidly small.please start a petition to extend the length by alot.it annoys everyone who uses the bio feature when even a list of damage types and security status kos info is to long, let alone any other info.show your support by adding a post underneath say 'supported'.with the planned expansion into a true social eve network, the use of the bio space by players will increase as they choose to add details of where they are in the cosmos.the present size restrictions will prevent players from adequately detailing how others can contact them on and in the new proposed social aspect of eve. for the new connectivity via the new proposed in-game-browser to achieve full functionality it makes sense for the first port of call for one player to see about another is the player's bio. where links and info can be detailed, amongst other prevelent info, to all places the player might wish others to go in the cosmos."
9/21/2009,people should be using the notes feature and eve mails hell even offsite forums and google searches to do that kind of crap.not bios.making bios longer will tempt people to write shakespearean sized bios... making things laggier.no thanks..ill pass.
9/21/2009,"no thanks, jade const style novels in every bio is unwanted."
9/21/2009,no thx most bio's suck this would make them suck so much harder
9/21/2009,i want to be able to put in a 16 page doctorate-esque background about my character and his likes and dislikes.
9/21/2009,"in case you haven't been playing for the last couple years, i'll just point out that carriers and dreadnoughts are utterly conventional ships these days. if you want an unconventional ship, try a destroyer."
9/21/2009,"why? just to have fun, try out the maxed capabilities from ships and stimulate/learning pvpwhen?just a couple of weeks a year spead out in between patches so that is doesnt interfere with testing."
9/21/2009,transferable!long overdue change.s'all.
9/21/2009,no. (first of all you failed to explain why. and the only reason i can think of atm ... no)
9/21/2009,yes...contract them all to me :)and for $#e% sakefix this:
9/21/2009,among other things could boost bounty hunting career .
9/21/2009,"you really need an explanation mr mclever? i think your name would suggest the opposite, unless it's one of thoose ironic names, you know, like a big 4ss mofo gorilla with the name ""tiny""?anyho, yes please, want this!"
9/21/2009,"sure. the tournament is fun but honestly i would rather see another ""type"" of tourny. heres the idea:get to mine 1m veldspar or something like that.get 2 teams to do it.get them to use any ships they want with the current tourny rules.let the fun begins lol.so if that wasn't clear. then theres 2 team in 1 huge pocket (if you warp off, your disqualified). the first to mine and get it in a can with an ammount of 1m veld or so is the winner. both team can use mining and combat ships. you can shoot anyone just like the regular tourny rules.p.s: i think that was proposed before but last year i think."
9/21/2009,"""it looks like team b is making a go at team a's hulks! team a's defense fleet seems to be intercepting...""hmm...seems interesting, but tbh, 1m veld is very very easy to get in a few hulks in ~10mins or less."
9/21/2009,this has already been done at the fanfest afaik
9/21/2009,"as long as the two teams are allowed to shoot at each other, then yeah. although, it still becomes a pvp tourney, rather than a mining tourney. the difference is a different goal.instead of just laying waste to the other team's ships, your goal would be to lay waste to their miners. however, the opponent's defense is laying waste to your ships, and also going after your miners.would be a more interesting battle as you have to balance objectives.though on second thought, that would probably just become a lay waste to the opponent's fighting ships battle. whoever wins that destroys the opponent's hulks to win faster."
9/21/2009,"the point of all this is to mine the x amount of minerals, not the fighting. so in a way, the goal of this tourny is to mine and protect...nothing else. you could destroy everything in team a but if you don't have a mining ship left...you lost. like in a tourny, if you lost your ship, your done.and yes, that would be interesting tourny lol"
9/21/2009,indeed and it wasn't much fun to watch as you had no idea until it was over who actually won as you couldn't tell who had got the most minerals. also with ships warping in and out constantly it was hopeless to follow.
9/21/2009,"except that a tourney that only mines x amount of minerals and no interaction of with the other teams (like blowing their ships out of the water) would be vastly boring to watch, pretty boring to participate, and is already decided at the beginning based on the character's skill levels, save for minor differences based on the fits of the hulks."
9/21/2009,"right now, on your api keys page you have 7 days worth of logs available to you, where you can see what page of the api was accessed using your key, what ip address accessed it, when, what time, etc.it's a great feature for finding out if your api information is being misused. but it's kind of ridiculous that this option isn't available in your account management as well. such account logs should log the following events:-type of login- ingame? website?-success or failure of login-password reset attempt-successful password resetand include the following information for these events:date/timeip addressthe logs should show more then just one week of activity though. it should show as much as technical limitations can allow. to prevent the servers from putting forth unnecessary effort, people should be required to click to go to the next page if they want to see more then a few days of activity.i think if players are given more tools to control the security of their own accounts, they are less likely to get their accounts hijacked."
9/21/2009,"i don't see how it can help.if your account got hijacked, the first thing their gonna do is change the password, locking you out. off-c if you owned it from the start, your gonna get it back, but do you honestly think they would do such a thing without using a proxy ?the only way this could help is if your managing account-sharing, and that is prohibited by the eula ... so i am left to wonder, why would a csm from a large spaceholding alliance with maybe close to 20 titans would ask for this in the eve of the titan change that will make it viable as an anti-capital weapon. :)"
9/21/2009,its all a csm conspiracy so that i can pass issues that somehow mysteriously give me a huge advantage over you.
9/21/2009,basically everything else in the world does this already.
9/21/2009,good suggestion! i approve of this. i would be interested in this information myself.
9/21/2009,"a log of who tries to log into the account when could be a good security measure - give you a hint of whether someone is trying to guess at your password. logs of successful password changes seems a bit pointless as a security feature, though. if the password has been changed, you've already lost. i won't comment on possible nefarious goals for this change(), but a login-attempt log seems a good idea."
9/21/2009,anything that gives a possibility of not getting to that point where they hijack your account is a step forward. such a log would alert you if your account name has been compromised.i also asked ccp in iceland to let us change our account names. right now there are no gm tools to do that.
9/21/2009,"also, rss."
9/21/2009,"at first i was going to say that is going a bit overboard but now that i think about it, that is an excellent addition to this proposal."
9/21/2009,please
9/21/2009,"sweet. new graphics, fast warp speed, no fittings."
9/21/2009,"hi everyoneattribute implants are a barrier to pvp for many pilots out there -particularly noobies for whom an implant set makes a significant difference to their training time and for whom losing out on skillpoints is particularly painful.in light of this, i would like your feedback on the following proposal: give everyone +5 to all attributes. remove attribute implants from the game (but keep 'utility' implants). improve the selection of combat/industry implants (keep them in high demand).instead of forcing players to choose between higher attributes and more pvp fun, let them risk 'utility' implants which can be just as expensive to lose but does not force them to lose skillpoints.the end result is more pvp and more fun but retains the risk/reward ethos -particularly for noobies for whom every sp counts.thoughts?"
9/21/2009,idea so dumb i don't even need a reason to say no.
9/21/2009,"while i agree that attribute implants are just as fail as learning skills, this would be the wrong way. we have jump clones already, only problem is that you need to wait 24 hours to hop between them. probably to prevent jumping all over the universe in seconds.so the real problem is in the jump clones timer in my opinion. a solution might be to allow jumping from one clone to another without restriction, but only if the jump clone target is in the same station as your current clone."
9/21/2009,"thanks for your input g.the more time spent without those +3/4/5 (budget willing) the harder it is to train. if a pilot wants a career as a pirate (and what noobie doesn't) jumping to an unplugged-clone means taking a skillpoint hit -which for new players is doubly painful.forcing players to choose between more skillpoints or more fun is silly and can be easily resolved with some better game design. the end result will be more pvp, more fun & still forcing pilots to 'put their chips on the table' when it comes to combat."
9/21/2009,"this is more or less the same argument i've heard to get rid of learning skills. it didn't move me then, and it doesn't move me now.eve is, at its heart, a game of choices. you make your choice and you take the consequences. oddly, i don't see hordes of people avoiding faction war and pirating because of implants."
9/21/2009,no.
9/21/2009,"i pvp for about 3 years in eve and until today i lost about 6 +3 implants. if you are restrained on pvp because of such small isk values, then you are not going to pvp anyway because ship losses usually are 2 order of magnitude larger than implant losses.just be smart and have 1 jc for each 2 atrribute combination, using +3 implants."
9/21/2009,"i'd be dead against this were it not for the fact that implant loss tends to be inflicted by lag more than anything else (the sole other cause being bubbles). in lieu of a better solution i find this proposal quite reasonable, besides anything that removes a dissuading factor for those considering pvp or contemplating braving the hazards of sub 0.5 sec for the first time is worth more than the blatant disregard shown so far."
9/21/2009,you don't see them because they're in high-sec running missions until they grow bored after 3-7 months and quit.
9/21/2009,"wait, you want to take away the +5 implants i spent all that isk on, and give everyone the +5?really?"
9/21/2009,"i think it would be a good idea to just have faction police in empire instead of concord; or, all together get rid of super-responsive npcs that magically probe out offenders within seconds.this would fix:ninja salvager whines - you could shoot them""this guy is hiding in an npc corp"" whines - you could shoot themhi-sec macro miners whines - you could shoot them""wardecs are broken"" whines - you could shoot them""low-sec is dead"" whines - carebears, no longer 'safe' in hi-sec, would prefer low-sec or 0.0 for better rewards.""solo pvp is dead"" whines - more people would be in low-sec or 0.0, doing pve activity or hunting pve pilots.tl/dr whines - ""you could shoot them, if we got rid of concord.""edit: more fixes!"
9/21/2009,but everybody else would whine
9/21/2009,"but everybody else would whineonly the high-sec mission-runners or miners who already whine whenever one of their ships blow up because they did something stupid (i.e., engaged a loot thief or ore thief). i have never seen a ""my ship got violenced!"" thread where the victim had a decent pvp fit, and where they were aware of the incoming enemy's approach until several minutes after said enemy has landed in their mission pocket or flipped their jet can. those of us who know the least little bit about pvp mechanics know that you can see incoming ships on the d-scan well before they land, and that you can see probes on scan well before the probing ship is able to warp to you. the people you mention that would be potential whiners would be forced to learn how to fit their ships properly (just like everyone else), watch their directional scanner for probes (just like everyone else), and not fly more than they can afford to lose (just like everyone else)."
9/21/2009,"op translation: ""make all of high sec into low sec""so.... how do we get rid of the ""why can't i shoot them here?"" whines?"
9/21/2009,"""why can't i shoot them here?"" whines do not just come from ego-stroking pvp enthusiasts. how many ""ninja salvager whine"" threads have you seen where the op of said thread advocates being allowed to shoot at the ninja salvager for stealing ""his"" salvage that he worked to create? how many ""gank whine"" threads have you seen where the op of said thread wishes he could get back at the guy, but can't, 'cos the guy stays docked up during his 15 minute gcc--after which, the op can't touch him. the way you get rid of the ""why can't i shoot them here?"" whines is to allow everyone to be shot everywhere."
9/21/2009,"i meant your whine.high sec was designed for a reason and it won't be changed. it may get rid of the whines you post, but it will also cancel many many many accounts from ccp's user base, destroy empire trade, and make much of the game non-functional (based on said destruction of empire trade and the resulting vast increase in prices and loss of ability for goods to move to needed areas)."
9/21/2009,"seriously? are we having this whine again? your argument basically boils down to you don't play the game the way i want you to, so ccp should change the game and force you to.""quit being so self-centered."
9/21/2009,"go to a low-sec or 0.0 system. open the market. are there things for sale? are there some things for sale in such quantities that an industrial or a freighter must have logically been used to bring them there? do market hubs exist in these areas? if so, then your argument is invalid. i'm not whining about wanting to shoot people. i am a carebear. but if eve is supposed to be a cold, harsh place, why am i so safe?i don't recall making an argument, ma'am. all i've said is a proposal (get rid of concord), and what it would fix."
9/21/2009,"i agreeedit:it wouldn't affect me, as i live in low sec, so why not?"
9/21/2009,seriously?you (op) must be totally out of your fraking mind!while your at it let's make the whole damn game 0.0 and say screw it to industry.think before you post!seriously!
9/21/2009,your alliance is a 0.0 alliance - you live in providence. do you believe that industry does not occur in 0.0?
9/21/2009,firstly we are not cva.secondly were friendly to cva...that dosent mean we operate exclusivly there!goes to show how very little you really know and how frequent you assume!like it or not high sec/concord is here to stay.industry requires high sec regardless of affiliation!everyone knows all super alliances have alts that work here!whered you come from? a black hole?
9/21/2009,"there's been tons and tons of different proposals to increase account security to prevent accounts from being hijacked. but what about this very simple solution: a confirmation email to change your password? it's done in practically everything i can think of, so i don't see it being an issue to implement.now, there's the chance of the thief changing your email. well, a workaround would be to send a confirmation email to your old email account first. if your old email was deactivated (thus your need to change it), make the site take your payment information to verify that you are in fact the true owner.while i realize that keyloggers will probably snag email passwords and that sort of thing, it would reduce the amount of hijacked accounts considerably regardless. there's plenty of phishing sites out there that look like an eve login page, plus the isk selling sites that actually steal your password, but it would at least add some sort of security layer. of course, it would be helpful to have different passwords for email and eve, but that's just common sense."
9/21/2009,"don't we already have confirmation emails to reset our passwords?i'm pretty sure we do, and that's a security liability not a benefit."
9/21/2009,"if you get banned from sisi, you get a permaban. if the offense is serious enough, extend the ban to a two week ban from tq as well. i support this as long as there's no permabans on tq. that's just too much.the climate on sisi is rapidly deteriorating to a state that's closing on ""impossible to test anything"". there needs to be harscher punishments in order to stave this stupidity off. i don't agree with the above poster that less people will be on sisi or less people will go due to the risks of a ban. sensible people will still go, because they will adhere to the rules and subsequently not get banned."
9/21/2009,"real world comparison:- i go to a paintball event and proceed to backstab my team by dishing out headshots when their backs are turned .. get promptly booted from event.- i leave the paintball facility and is picked up by the police and thrown in jail.doesn't sound even remotely fair nor just.a permanent sisi ban, be it account or ip based is severe enough. it is a privilege to use the server and there are rules attached. as those rules do not apply in tq there should be no ""bleed through"" whatsoever."
9/21/2009,as much as i can concur with the large number of scumbags in sisi... this isn't going to fly well.it's really a different world out there as opposed to tq.the only way i'd support this is if its a repeat offense.... ignoring a gm should have a major impact as far as examples... but not even on the first...second.. or third strikes really.not supported because its a bit too prejudicial.
9/21/2009,"this would work normally except for the fact that goons have lots of alts to keep on keeping on no matter how many get banned and it pretty much seems that the people that keep pulling this **** over and over are doing it to expressly ""troll"" sisi. if ccp handed out some two week bans on tq over it, i think really qwuickly you'd see this **** come to a full stop. supported."
9/21/2009,"it would need to be in extremely blatant cases of rule violations.someone that ganks a player or two on sisi should get a ban from sisi, but not one on tq.someone that gets a group of players to place bubbles at the fd-mlj gate in pf-346 or any gate on the way to fd-mlj and then proceeds to kill everything that enters, even as players tell them they are breaking the rules, deserve at most, a 1-2 week ban from tq.they know exactly what they are doing and they can't accidentally drop bubbles and accidentally shoot everything that enters.a developer has to take the time to investigate the claims, the more time they waste banning trouble makers from sisi the less time they have to actually make eve. if the penalty is upped to tq bans (even if temporary), players that go to the sisi server for ""lulz"" might wise up once they know being a jerktard can result in a tq ban too."
9/21/2009,and extend the forum bans to the server too.
9/21/2009,"yes, there would be less credible people on sisi. you've had at least two people on the forums post as much, and we're not even a good sampling of the player base.if the devs or gms really thought there was a testing problem on sisi, then the first step would be to have people apply for the privilege to test on sisi, just as players would apply for a beta test for a new game. that's all that sisi is, really, is beta testing. treat it like that.if a player doesn't follow the rules of beta testing in any system he is kicked out of the beta testing... and allowed back later as a paying customer. i can't see any customer being banned from beta testing and paying for the game based on something he did that broke the beta testing rules, save for maybe hacking or very severe insults and swearing at the gms/devs. i can't see it happening in eve, either."
9/21/2009,"so when one target pops, the gun will automatically start targeting the next? seems a reasonable response to the fact that pos guns only get one target. that said, it could get ugly with one player controlling multiple batteries with different targeting queues - i don't know how often that comes up, but it could be ugly for the ui when it does. still, i can support this in principle."
9/21/2009,what you want is called pos gunner. learn starbase defense mgmt.herschel i think what he wants is kind of a different ui for pos gunning. not so much a new feature. but i think the current pos gunnery ui is fine.
9/21/2009,"the fifteen minute block on login is *******s for someone that has a legitimate bad connection. how about this?a ship that disconnects in any way should:1. be scrammable and not ignore scrams (as they sometimes do when logoffski during gate-cloak)2. not disappear from space if they are agressed (ie you are being scrammed or shot at)3. warp to a safespot 1 mil km away and nowhere else regardless of amounts of login/logouts and always warp back to the exact same spot they left if you log back in (even if you instantly log out again. you simply land in your original location and then the game initiates a new emergency warp, with align and all that jazz).this would lead to that a logoffski that is agressed is screwed regardless. a logoffski that does get away has no way of warping to several spots. a logffski that logs off and on and off in order to make a new warp will find himself back at the origin point (pirates or whatever) before doing another align and warp.that would solve it for logoffskis without hurting people that legitimately disconnect or log off in space for the end of a gaming session.thoughts?(also thread necro!)"
9/21/2009,"/agreedfix logoffski, we want play with real pvp game not tricky exploit game, where someone know trick, that is uncatchable."
9/21/2009,sounds like a valid problem to me.
9/21/2009,"i'm guessing you're implying that jump bridges will not be implemented with the new sov system.nobody knows this for sure at the moment since ccp have not yet released details on exactly what kind of upgrades one can do to systems. a skilled jf pilot can jump that ship 11.25 ly, at least i would suggest that it's more than enough.if 11 ly is not enough for you, i suggest you bring 2x guardians/basilisk at the end cyno point and have the next cyno up already."
9/21/2009,ease of logistics with jumpbridges for capitals makes it easier for alliances to keep huge swathes of space.with the new system the places with bad connectivity to the rest of eve and far away from the rest might be left alone by the big powers and settled by others.so jf or any other logistics tool doesn't really need to be made easier.
9/21/2009,"this has nothing to do with jumpbridges but more the viability of the end systems for alliances to take.assume you take a constelation in the backest region of period basis, there is no way to jump there from lowsec in 1 go. so that space will only be usable by someone with a nap with the people owning querious systems since you need a midpoint or 2."
9/21/2009,"yes, because it's not actually possible to jump combat ships and jfs to the same cyno, and therefore you cannot possibly run a combat-ready convoy through enemy-held space. as such, we need to make jump logistics falling-down easy in order to prevent there being any possibility whatsoever of logistics being difficult or dangerous. wtf? no."
9/21/2009,not supported. deep space was viable (and used) before jump frieghters and jump bridges. both of these innovations have become crutches. learn to walk (fly) again.
9/21/2009,do you even fly a jump freighter? are you even qualified to talk about such things?take a walk before you embarrass yourself.ps: oh and i can fly one... you'd be surprised just how far one can fly thank you very much... i suggest you do your homework before you start yelling the sky is falling amirightkthxbai.even at 10 ly's you can reach fantastic distances i never thought possible.did you know that rens and jita are within in that 10 ly range (even tho concord won't let me do that its just a rough idea of how small our world really is!).hell i could hit 0.0 from the edges of high sec! you seriously have no bloody idea what your speaking of... even at a minimum of 2 jumps i can go anywhere i want for the most part... within reason of course.
9/21/2009,"i could be wong but i think it was possible year's ago to remotly stack stuff you had in others region, i think it should be possible again or possible..it would be server load friendly as i bet i'm not the only one who have assets in """"trapped"""" space, which show as ""1705 items"" but if you remove all the : ""1x1mn afterburner""""1x1mn afterburner""""1x2mn afterburner""""1x5mn afterburner""in a ""9x1mn afterburner""would much easier for everybody to manage"
9/21/2009,"how about a saftey in numbers/defensive only aproach.for instance, make them so only one can be fitted per ship and only on mining vessels. this way only miners can use them. make them high dps with bad tanks. make them with disruptor so gank pilots might count them as high priority targets. make them defensive only so they only fire if they or their flock are fired upon. make them intelligent so they point seperate unprovoked aggresors to the maximum range possible but concentrate fire one by one starting with tackling vessels. basically make them buy the miner enough time to escape and nothing else."
9/21/2009,another aproach to feilding them could be to let mining vessels hold as many of these bulky contraptions as they can carry but still only allow them to field 1 per vessel at a time. because other wise people would just hit them once and send them scurrying off through heavilly camped space. give them a cargo vs saftey decission to make.
9/21/2009,"i *would* support the general idea as it brings more people to lowsec, which is always good.the downside is: i believe it will be hard to balance. to little effect and it will be a useless item. too strong: it will convert lowsec into a fortress (citing someone from earlier in the thread).i also see different needs for 0.0 (keep a 30 hac sniper gang busy) and empirenear lowsec (1-2 lonely bcs pirating).as others have stated: pos guns take forever to target and can be tanked. a sniper gang can easily kill some hulks before the need to warp out.summary:good idea, but the implementation is flawed, back to the drawingboard with something easier to balance and you will have my support."
9/21/2009,"it's not a ******ed suggestion. it's actually pretty reasonable. the only problem i see with it is that it's easily exploitable. anchor 5 guns in a low sec belt, fly around and bait a few pirates in an ""easy target"" ship, and then warp to the belt. the pirates land in the middle of hell and gets blown to bits in a big ""lulz"" in local.it's a very good suggestion, but i'm not so sure about it's actual implementation."
9/21/2009,defensive only no need to hit snipers just the furthest tackler. if you are in a hostile fleet that warps in an attacks but you decide not to fire the guns should not attack you even if their owners decide to. as long as you don't draw first blood. as far as tracking just say it was donated by concord since the guns follow their ideals so closely. this idea gives miners time if a gang comes in miners warp out. it also would beef up security enough that a small defensive fleet which is ussually what there is to protect miners because the rest of them left their pvp ships to fly hulks would change it from purley escape oriented to you messed with the wrong miners with the addition of a ecm boat or a well tanked bs or son logistics ships for the guns longevity. but still defencive only
9/21/2009,"no objections. it's already availible in the account management page. having it on login gives you a constant update and can prevent the dreaded ""account disabled"" punch in your face when you are eager to play."

9/22/2009,yep.
9/22/2009,"this proposal is not meant for inside the heat of the battle but rather outside. however having the ability to cycle drones by adding repair speed while in triage and making it a viable option to repair in battle would be interesting.this would be very nice however i am not sure if this would be possible, but that is up to ccp as always.with the upcoming changes it might be a good idea since triage will be removed from ms and i think triage should open the option for active usage of this in battle. however it should not rival the triage repair rate."
9/22/2009,"can't believe i'm actually agreeing with a privateer...i support the concept, and i think i have a thoery on how it could be coded (post to appear soon).good stuff pb."

9/22/2009,"drop the time? maybe 1 min?the timer still doesn't force people to formulate a post for that time... we still see pointless threads.let the people who need to discuss something on the forums get to it. that's what they're for, right?"
9/22/2009,"it's just like the onboard scanner...they fix a problem and try not to harm their users but they still manage to annoy the hell out of the regular suscribers. 0.5 or 1 second should be enough for the onboard scanner, 2 minutes should be long enough before posting again.do you realize how long it takes now to support 3-4 topics a day in the assembly hall and bid on 4-5 auctions in the sell orders?"
9/22/2009,"yeah, i'm personally very unhappy with this five minute delay."
9/22/2009,in total? almost a goddamn hour. the minor consolation is that it is only temporary while they work on a more permanent solution to keylog spam posters. hopefully it will be.... tomorrow.
9/22/2009,"decrease the timer if need be, but no captcha. it's annoying, stupid, annoying, and especially either useless or unusable.either the image is so easy to read that even mediocre ocr programs can read it, or it's so complicated it takes three tries to get through it."
9/22/2009,"yes please fix the delay on the forumsas far as your scanner, i wish they'd bump the delay up to 15 secs, lag is bad ok"
9/22/2009,"since the 5 min forum timer was implemented:-frequency of stupid posts has dropped.-frequency of keylogger posts has dropped.-frequency of caod crap has dropped.-frequency of trolling/flaming/trash talking had dropped.-frequency of grammar/spelling errors and edits has dropped.with all this in mind, you actually want to remove the 5 min delay? why?"
9/22/2009,this
9/22/2009,i support re-captcha
9/22/2009,"because it takes ages to reply to topics, a lot of the times a post is ready to be posted and is just left in a tab waiting for the timer to disappear.there's idiots and there always will be, but it hurts a lot of posters such as myself that goes through forums in ""waves"" and view 20 topics at once, then leave for a while.you're telling me i should sit and think about if i really want to check a box that says ""support"" for 5 minutes? change the timer to apply only to creating topics. problem solved."
9/22/2009,"remove the damned timer, its really really gay when your trying to reply to multiple threads at once."
9/22/2009,"supported, reduce timer or apply it to creating topics, its ridiculous that i have to wait when i quickly browse through forums, want ot reply, have to wait 5 minutes, then forget about it all together"
9/22/2009,"i hope you're not the one representing this on the next csm meeting. wtf at not knowing how to narrow targets down and recommending to use scanner probes instead. how did you get in there anyway?edit: oh, and bump."
9/22/2009,"i agree, this delay isn't that great. also ever since the update i've been getting directional scans that take upwards of 5 minutes. i don't want to say they're related, but i'm assuming they are...please remove or significantly shorten the timer."
9/22/2009,please oh god please give us back a scanner that we can actually use . . .this change has made my experience of the game about 10x more frustrating and pretty much wrecks a good scout's ability to give accurate reports or find hostiles with any reasonable speed.
9/22/2009,i would like to say this change stinks and i'd like my old d-scanner back.
9/22/2009,supported ccp need to reverse this
9/22/2009,"no support for this. keep the timer!all of the pirates and griefers, hard to feel sorry for ya. so until this changes....i have a whole 2 seconds more to try and align and warp a barge."
9/22/2009,good ideas.
9/22/2009,"i am sorry that somebody ""broke the law"" and outed a ccp dev (still employed by ccp, by the way) who decided that he wanted to rig things in favor of his alliance. i am sorry that ccp's favorite alliance got disbanded. that is no excuse for going on a witchhunt against anyone associated with the guy who pointed out ccp's corruption."

9/22/2009,"yeah, and they don't need customers at all ... oh wait.if this is true - considering who it came from i suspect that it has good chances to be true, this is bigger than t20.t20 may have broken some rules of the game, but it was all about pixels who belong to ccp in the end anyway.ps: if shc did remove this, than ccp did a good thing hiring caldown, for 30-40k $ / year they just 'bought' the fidelity of the biggest fan forum."
9/22/2009,here it comes again... the whine/tearful lynch mob.as it's been stated before... the i is for internal people.... we have no business assuming anything.and that's all this damn proposal is... a big fat assumption.while i think the gm's need adjustments... i don't need to know what they had for lunch.
9/22/2009,"dear ccp alt, pitch and fork is what gets results, every business owner wants to save face and continue to have the trust of the buyers, it worked for t20, it worked for the rattler incident and will continue to work."
9/22/2009,if i worked for ccp... you'd find yourself banned for any number of reasons i could think of.oh wait.. i don't.i guess that makes your little assumption a bit... stupid?
9/22/2009,"this.the article given is an example of isd and bh who are players who volunteer for these positions and not official ccp employees. so give that a thought.t20 was a massive screw up an ccp knew it, something like this have never happened after that internally."

9/22/2009,whats thats supposed to mean?only a few hours passed between when he did it and he got caught.
9/22/2009,so your ccp who ?

9/22/2009,"in addition to the fleet invite notification, what about with chat invites as well?"
9/22/2009,"i just had an idea that would seriously improve the immersion aspect of eve sound:binaural sound.wouldn't it be awesome to tell where a nearby ships is in relation to you just by hearing it? if the effect gets disorienting, allow it to be turned off or use speakers instead of headphones.if you don't know what it is, here's an example."
9/22/2009,"a few questions with that (besides the technical difficulties since binaural sound is processed at recording time usually):1) would the sound be oriented with regards to your ship or your camera? 2) is 3d sound really that important in eve? its not nearly as much of a positioning game as an fps game.3) will this actually benefit once you get into fights with more than a few pilots. currently, all ships sound more or less (or exactly) the same. hard to distinguish"
9/22/2009,"on your second question, i think directional sound (based on your camera position, not your ship position) can be very usefull, especially given the omni-directional nature of eve combat. if you could hear a distict sound for each module type aswell as being able to tell where it comes from, then you could gain a serious edge in combat by memorizing those sounds, and thus knowing exactly what ships are using which modules."
9/22/2009,"additional clarification: your eyes are hyper-focussed, especially compared to your ears, which are extremely good at pinpointing the exact location of a sound's origin. if eve's soundsystem could accurately make use of this, it'd be a very big gain, tactically aswell as emersion-wise."
9/22/2009,"dierdra, that is a very good idea. i would also have to agree that it should be relative to the camera's position and direction. it would allow everyone to easily become immersed in the game.on a slightly related note, i want my hair back... (maybe i should get a hold of youtube about that...)"
9/22/2009,really would love this.
9/22/2009,"liang nuren - i respond to posters in kind, so far, all i've interpreted from your responses have been narrowminded arguments with little, or no constructive content. try harder if you expect anything more than flames/rapid fire responses next time.as i mentioned to someone else, the changes to t2 ammo are a band aid. there's a major issue with the current design and implementation of t2 ammo due mainly to availability of faction. these changes more or less bring the ammo types in line with conflag. you talk about kiss however, somehow you want the ccp to totally rebalance, implement database mods for dozens, if not hundreds of turrets, and then q/a every minmatar ship effected by your broadsweeping changes during a major expansion? for instance, tachyeons/beams have roughly the same fitting costs as 1400mm's, hence my point on the paladin, it has the grid to fit it's turrets properly mainly due to the fact that there isn't a massive difference in fitting costs between short and long range. you'd actually have a better argument for increasing the power grid on autocannons tbh because that's the root cause of this issue. unless you want to do something idiotic, like changing the fitting requirements of artillery or autocannons (and thus rebalancing and q/a of a whole bunch of ships) - a second role bonus that brings the varugurs fittings capabilities in line with the other marauders will not break eve... ok?not in the same way a navy raven totally invalidates a raven, right? like i said on the target painter bonus, feel free to come up with something unique, but in line with other tier 2, tech 1 battleships. we also considered shield and armour remote repair and cap use range bonuses however they just through the ship way out of kelter in comparison to the others.in terms of dps, as i mentioned in the op, the ships likely fitting is considered when measuring the dps. an armour tanking tempest will rarely have 3 damage mods for instance, where as 3 would be standard on a shield tanker. the actual max dps figures are lower, but combined with ac range, +200m/s mwd speed and spare drones, it provides an alternative to the standard can it rr? (x)/can it snipe? (x)/can it tank? (x)/can it gank? (x)/can it solo? (x) top trumps archetype whilst still being in line with the others in it's class. merely making the tempest competitive in one or more of those standard areas would simply displace it's racial peers, or spur on a gallente or caldari boost bandwangon next season. on rr performance specifically, the fitting requirements of large remote shield boosters are the principle reason why no one does it (turtle style anyway, shield logistics are very common), but as we're not really wanting to boost rr atm, i'm going to let it slide.on ac's becoming blaster-lasers... fall-off is a ****ty mechanic to balance battleship turrets around, we agree on this, yet, you insist on using it still, because of racial flavor. suit yourself. i get the desire to have a tactile difference between firing one set of turrets and ac's, however, until game mechanics change, there's very little to work with. optimal increase is not only the path of least resistance, it's probably more balanced (ponders a vargur with 90-110km fall-off with rigs after astrophobic's fix is implemented)like i mentioned earlier, i believe i've not only offered suggestions that follow the path of least resistance, provided the fixes where they are needed (ie. i do not believe thrashers/sabres/claws need +50% more alpha tyvm), but i also believe i've tried i've considered the effects of these changes in context. atheistofdoomi think it's better than a double damage bonus where one damage bonus would do tbfh. although, i would like to here you suggestion"
9/22/2009,"pattern, there are *three whole posts* worth of comments on flaws in your proposal. how about you stop evading the questions and answer them?-liang"
9/22/2009,"well argumented.behind the charts and numbers i can tell you some of the things from fleet fights. i fly often tempest/maelstrom.1. tempest`s primaried allways .. not becouse of the damage they can put over time but becouse of the tank.2. tempest on paper(charts) looks great...but wondering why people are switching to amarr(firstly)/gallente/caldary turret ships instead using minmatar, in the fleet battles? it must be becouse, not in the order of importance: tank, damage, rof (yep ..there`s an verry important variable in a fleet fight)and not becouse the cap variable."
9/22/2009,"resubmitting, because this:should not be the minmatar fix."
9/22/2009,all the time before iceland... leads up to iceland and what is done in those few days is the culmination of all the csm's work during that term till then.there are more online csm-ccp meetings afterwards but they arent face to face. the first iceland trip is really the most important time in the csm by far.
9/22/2009,"this just reeks of potential abuse of favoritism by ccp (don't we have enough of that *tinfoil*) long term csm members will form natural friendships or more between players and ccp and that always ends bad. as larkonis noobler has show us, it doesn't take much for a csm member to go ""fck csm"" and flat out cheat for personal gains.also, you will have people voting for the same people without really looking at the other candidates or performance.lastly, new blood is always good for any organization. fresh ideas, fresh viewpoints and new perspectives are good. good corporations and alliances are always recruiting the best pilots and the csm should always be doing the same, electing 4 of the same people will put the csm in a rut.if this is about poor issler, well thems the breaks. i'm pretty sure issler could have turned down the position and then saved the full term for later.no."
9/22/2009,hell ****ing no!!!
9/22/2009,makes sense. it would help in all engagements whether it be pvp or pve.
9/22/2009,"so i recently did an analysis for a different post.it shows that the best 25 ships in game are all minmatar and gallente except for 2 which were amarr.the best caldari ship was the drake at position 26.the data analysied was the combat records of the best 95 players in eve.from battle clinic i got the stats on the ships they have flown for the last year. so 95 man years of pvp data.i grouped all the kills and losses for each ship type, then worked out 2 parameters.effectiveness and popularity.effectiveness was a percentage based indicator of kills versus losses.the equation was 100*(kills)/(kills+losses+1).the +1 was in the equation to prevent divide by zero on ships with small sample sizes and to prevent them getting 100% with only a few kills.popularity was how often a ship was flown in combat compared to its class counterparts.the ships were sorted into groups ( frig1 , frig2 , hac1 , hac2 , bc1 ) etc. each group had 4 ships in it.equation = 100 * ( kills + losses ) / ( group kills + group losses ).effectiveness tends to favour tanky ships or ships that can run away.popularity tends to favour ships that can get kills.to get a final score for each ship i added the paramaters together and divided by 2.this gives each ship a score out of 100.the ships were then sorted by score to see which are the best ships in game taking into account there class."
9/22/2009,link to spreadsheets
9/22/2009,"i'm going to assume you're trolling since you don't show any kind of valuable proof whatsoever.also, i lol'd at exequror being #8 and nyx being first is pretty funny.3/10."
9/22/2009,found your problem.
9/22/2009,"ccp need to seriously re-evaluate how they approach balacing caldari.* most of the ships in alliance tourney were caldari.* caldari can rat faster then any race, while their ships allow 2 month noobs to tank lvl4 missions.* caldari space is overcrowded, ccp's solution, ""add more agents, make caldari even more attractive"".so caldari get better and better, have more and more content added. while due to the large volume of players in caldari any nerfs are met with large volumes of complaints.the solution to the caldari problem is...not more agents.not more stations.not better ships.not better ecm."
9/22/2009,you also left out the fact that there are human people flying those ships.... a good majority of them who are idiots/failfits... including the guy who thinks this proposal is worth a damn.while i agree that buffing caldari is a bit of an obvious overtone.... this is not the best argument for it.sure as hell shouldn't be weighed by pvp'ing statistical crap.i mean... that's like saying everyone flys drakes... even if i fail fit it.duh?
9/22/2009,so i think we should all just give up and buy nyx's because they're the bestest!
9/22/2009,oh god nerf teh exequereroroer.
9/22/2009,"the dataset will be published tonight.it was 5am in the morning by the time i had finished compiling and analyzing the data.i'll linky the sheet to eve-files when i get home tonight.the kill and loss stats were from the top 95 players on the bc killboard.you dont get on there without being at least competent at pvp.thats exactly why this dataset is relevant to the argument. it shows the ships being flown by the best pvp'rs in eve and it shows how effective they are when flying those ships.:)yeah its the best tier i cruiser , not saying its the best ship in game.an analysis has to take into account cost of ships. theres no point comparing a hac directly to a frig for instance that wouldnt show much of interest."
9/22/2009,tourney pvp is not tranquility pvp.you cant leave the arena without being exploded by a gm.this gives 2 advantages to caldari that arnt present on tq.damage at range & better tanks through lack of needing to fit tackle in mids.
9/22/2009,exequror > all cruisers bar the scimitar
9/22/2009,"your methodology bears no resemblance to any sort of realistic pvp ranking, and as such i hope you'll pardon me if i regard your conclusions as not being worth the paper they're written on."
9/22/2009,"you've put a lot of effort into this. but really, when you're trolling, you need to be more convincing. sort out the positions of the celestis and ferox, for a start. and it's a bit obvious to place most of the supercapitals right at the bottom, apart from gallente ones which are right at the top.hang on, nerf gallente!"
9/22/2009,oh is that so? so we should all bend over and worship these 95 people?these 95 people are gods of eve now?should i start kissing there @$$'s so i can get what i want in this game?you are really something if you think that's going to help your case.in case you forget poindexter.... not everyone in this game are pvp'er'sand statistics can be made to say anything... to anyone.. at any time.don't bother wasting your time on such fruitless ventures.
9/22/2009,"yeah the supercapital results have to be taken with a pinch of salt, even with 95 years worth of pvp data the supercapitals dont have a very big sample size.but i did not want to jiggy with the raw data , so they are in atm.i cant jiggle the positions of the ships either , it would become apparent that i cheated if i did that :)the raw data kills/losses is in the sheet , so the data is fully validatable by anyone who want to go to bc and total up the kills/ losses for each player.^^ this i did btw by copy - paste into the spreadsheet and then sorting and using a sheet function to count the totals , so there shouldnt be any miss-counts in the data.i did take out the t3 as there wasnt a full years data for those yet.i also had to take out the faction ships as there group size was so much bigger than the t1/t2.i will publish the full list ( inc t3 and faction ) in the other thread though that is not so much concerned with balance between the primary races."
9/22/2009,"yes you can get on there without being competent, battleclinic does not have all information unless the player in question has their api linked to it. this will be in many cases not so and the player will only post their killmails and not lossmails giving a distorted view of these ""statistics"". not keeping into account that killmails can oh so easily be faked.rating the skill of a player in pvp by kills and losses against kills and losses in a group does not give a real picture because it does not show the situation in which the battle happened.also the statistics are based on player performance and preference and not on what can actually be done with the ships in question.these statistic are therefore just numbers and can not be used to support your proposal.onto your proposal itself. caldari ships are good when properly utilized. they can provide a stable amount of damage from amazing ranges, provide ecm warfare, provide the best sniping platforms and tank if needed. caldari however can not easily provide tackling support and high damage.this means that caldari are specialized and so are the other races but they are less noticeable and i bet you can figure that out on your own so i don't have to name them.boosting amarr? no, they are the most popular ships atm and they are good at what they do."
9/22/2009,"the kb will consider mails from every api and post it has.whenever a player gets a loss mail another player get the kill mail.i do not know if the players do as you insinuate , it does not matter.considering the size of the dataset 130,000 kill iirc, its unreasonable to assume that fake posts or non posting of km's would show a bias towards any races ships.if anything random not linkage of mails of fake posts would tend to flatten out the race bias in the data as the fake posts or non linkages would apply to all races more or less equally.the dataset is 95 years worth of pvp data. it refelects the proportion of fleet/roam/gankage/solo that happens in eve. this is good because it reflect the overall ability of a ship in any/all circumstances rather than rellying on seperate interpretations of ( solo/roam/fleet/gankage ) which could introduce bias.also the statistics are based on player performance and preference and not on what can actually be done with the ships in question.yes.pvp players prefer ships that are good at pvp , preference is a proxy for ship capability.player performance in each ship in question is also a proxy for ship capability.statistics are good.many people go this ship is bad that ship is bad and offer no evidence at all.they can and will be used to support my proposals.amarr have some good ships yes they need less of a boost than caldari.the statistics clearly show minmatar and gallente to be way out in front when it comes to pvp."
9/22/2009,"i'm getting slightly worried that the op is serious and isn't trolling.seriously, you have a list that tells you that supercaps are the worst ships in game, except for the gallente ones which are somehow the best. this, and the position of the ferox, exequeror, wolf, jaguar, vigil and many many more tells you that your list is nonsense. you stayed up to 5am producing statistical noise."
9/22/2009,i have always said we need to narf exequror as first priority.
9/22/2009,"dont wait up , the sheet wont be up till 1am.but please take a look when its up and you can tell me if i'm mad.i had no idea what it would show when i started it."
9/22/2009,lol at navitas (gallente mining frigate) being better than omen or maller or even paladin for that matter.
9/22/2009,the navitas is a decent mining frigate.the omen and maller are woefully bad cruisers.thats why navitas gets a better score than omen / maller.there no point compareing across ship classes that would allways show bs>cruiser>frig.
9/22/2009,i thought that list were showing pvp rating of ships.navitas has 46.15 rating while tormentor (amarr mining frigate) which is just as good only gets 3.85 rating.bantam has 32.05 rating while burst has 17.69 rating.burst has 140 cpu while other 3 ships have 150 and can fit 2 t2 miners.tormentor also has 3 low slots for cargo expanders while bantam and navitas have 2 and burst only has 1.in my opinion that makes tormentor the best mining frigate and burst the worst.if this list is not about mining aspect of these ships i would still have have hard time believing that navitas is that good for pcp activities.
9/22/2009,"dont get too hung up on individual ships and what you think it might show.this is primarilly pvp data , so mining frigs which arnt really upto pvp are gonna be a bit spurious. capsules & indi's & shuttle were removed from the data as non pvp ships , i supposed i could have removed the tier 1 frigs as well but then where do you draw the line ?.the thing that concerns me is that most of the best ships in class are gallente/mini."
9/22/2009,for the guy who thinks caldari can't do high damage...raven 1360 dpsrokh 1100+ dpscnr 1600+ dpsdrake 700+ dpsnighthawk 700+ dpsvulture 600+ dpsfalcon 320+ dpsrook 450+ dpslearn your facts before you open your mouth. all these ships are capable of huge tanks with gank.
9/22/2009,"something's been bothering me about your sample selection,a nd i finally figured out what it is.your popularity rating - i'm not sure what your assumptions were when looking at popularity, but i'm not sure they lend themselves to an objective analysis. popularity is a woefully bad measure of objective data because it takes into account a human factor that cannot be factored out of the equation.for example, you may assume that people always fly the best ship for whatever role they were trying to fill, but this may not be true. they may have been flying a particular ship because that's what they hand on hand, or because that's the only ship of that class/type they can fly.popularity also skews your kills to losses ration for the simple reason that a more popular ship has a larger chance of getting lost, which skew it's effectiveness downwards.i'd be curious to see the raw effectiveness data as compared to the raw popularity data. because if your sampling is correct, there should be a direct relation between the two (again, assuming your original human factor assumptions were correct). my guess is, however, that there won't be, because of the reasons i laid out above (to whit, people don't always fly the most effective ship, for whatever reason)."
9/22/2009,"tldr = your statistics are full of crap.that's easier x)but yes... she's right... your basing this on ""popularity"" is utter foolishness at best.everyone flys whatever the hell they want to fly... its not going to be what you ""assume"" it to be."
9/22/2009,"popularity and effectivness are explained in the op.probably not very well , i'll try to improve the op a bit later when i have more time.effectiveness is kills / losses , more popular ships will get killed more often, they will also get more kills.effectiveness is a ratio so it improves in quality the more a ship is flown.there is a +1 term in the equation which prevents ships with small sample sizes from getting 100% with only a few kills.popularity is how often a ship is flown in combat ( kills + losses ) divided by how often the ship class is flown in combat.this shows the preference of players for a ship in its class.i think effectiveness is important because it shows us how good a ship is when in the hands of a good pvp'rpopularity is also important, effectiveness on its own only tells half the story , some ships may be survivable ( tough or quick ) but of lesser value on the battlefield.popularity clearly indicates which ships the sample group of players consider to be the best ships.considering the group size of 95 if eve was a balanced game then the preference for one races ships over another would be equal to within a few percent.this is clearly not the case.as i cant be seen to show favour for one method or the other i have weighted them equally in the ""rank score"" attribute.the data is now up on eve-files and linkied in the first reply.i use open office spread sheet but have saved versions for excel 97 from oo.i have included the raw data as it was copy and pasted from the ""known ships"" pages of bc.raw data 2 removes all the spurious clutter from the web page and shows the method used to total up the kills / losses for each ship.raw data 3 is the totaled up data before any analysis."
9/22/2009,current situation: it is difficult to conduct bombing runs or coordinate group movements with cloaked ships. they will constantly decloak each other if you try to move them together.proposed solution: if you're cloaked in gang/fleet with another cloaked ship you can't decloak them. nor can they decloak you. pros: because there is no way to know where your fleetmates are when cloaked you can't avoid coming too close to them. this solution solves that problem.cons: cloaked gangs will become deadlier by not accidently revealing each other.
9/22/2009,"no, absolutely not"

9/22/2009,i thought cloaked ships didnt decloak eachother? was this changed?
9/22/2009,it wont really make cloaking gangs *that* much deadiergood idea! i support it!
9/22/2009,this is dumb. no.
9/22/2009,i've confirmed that cloaked ships can decloak each other.
9/22/2009,"omg, i'm agreeing with a goon. what next?good thing other goons disagree, from that i take comfort."
9/22/2009,"makes sense to me, especially given that stealth bombers are now usable and are really a ship that wants to operate with several of them in close proximity."
9/22/2009,just because it sounds about the right thing to do realy...
9/22/2009,supported but its a bit hard to know where they are even then.
9/22/2009,no.
9/22/2009,/supportedcloaking and moving as a fleet can be a pain.
9/22/2009,it's a joke that covert ops cloaked ships in the same fleet can decloak each other.agreeing with goons.*shudder* .. there must be something seriously wrong.
9/22/2009,agreed. have lost a few kills because of this :(
9/22/2009,current situation: when a carrier pilot loses a fighter there is no accounting for this lost. and there are no killmails generate for the killer either. this presents a problem for corporations and alliances who want to reimburse fighters lost in combat. proposed solution: add some way to track fighter kill/losses. be it by kilmails or another means. we've got killmails for frigates and pos modules so why not fighters too?
9/22/2009,with a full deployment being 150million+ this really can become an issue.
9/22/2009,"sounds good.perhaps extend it to drones, if possible? special log that shows only ""deployable losses"" ?"
9/22/2009,tiny tiny tiny buttons.
9/22/2009,"yeah, pretty much all of these are silly. supported.edit: another problem came to mind. you can't create wtb contracts for non-base items(e.g., researched blueprints). i should be able to post a contract along the lines of ""wtb raven bpc, me 20+, pe 5+, runs 1+, 1m isk"", so that there can actually be two-way trade in such items."
9/22/2009,"confusion:ok, who can i kill? you can kill anyone who is red. blinky red or solid red? well, it used to be one, now it is the other. solid red is the old blinky red. blinky red now means they used to be beloved til they dated your sister and did her wrong. ...so that little skull with the minus sign means exactly what again? ..... this is just a glimpse into how confused i am when using the overview. there is no reason this needs to be confusing!!solution:add a tab to the overview display called ""key"". under the new key tab, there is a listing of all the different things that can be displayed on the overview and what they mean. little red minus sign = corp enemy. little green plus sign = corp friend, solid red line = well, whatever it means. i'm really not sure. please fix it so idiots like me can figure it out. apparently this is confusing to lots of us idiots, because every time i ask on the help channel, i get a different answer. maps have keys. how about the overview!!!!"
9/22/2009,"also, overview settings could easily be another tab, with the option to turn it off and use overview settings like before. but how much easier would it be to switch to a tab for changing settings? rather than trying to click the little header to the overview, click change settings, scroll through and change, close window, rinse & repeat when you want to change something else."
9/22/2009,aye!! what he said!
9/22/2009,remove it everywhere or dont remove it at all.or at least change it to managed mode in empire.this will make wardecs more interesting
9/22/2009,"okay that is a step in the right direction. i waited a while to actually feel this out and see if this was an acceptable change to eve, and it still rubs me sore.class restriction, that goes against the sandbox and lore(amount of rigging can be variable) and capitalism(risk v reward). i smell a wow employee in that choice...it's like fw items not being useable by people not enlisted...that's how awkward this feels.all while leaving the calibration system that can work to handle all that and balance against extreme rigging just to grief.(cheaper suicide ganker fits with t1 mods inbound!, mandatory inty rigging inbound!.)plus, a 5% bonus to a large ship with a s rig is more newb friendly, and customizable, all around. the player gets the exact choice of what risk and reward he fits to which ship. i'd even want bigger bonuses beyond what we see now if the sizes are appropriate. like s ecm rig gives 40% boost(stacking) on a kestrel but you have to pay for the m ecm rig to get that extra for a caracal. that give players more options who use ecm/varied skills no? an ecm skilled player fitting useful ecm to ferox/brutix. not in my eve.*rigging skills at 3-5 to unlock the extra efficiency from rigs would be even more customizable, not just timesinks like they are now.jeez, ccp this looks lazy, the more i look at it.(no offense, but i practice tough love.)also, put it on the drawingboard, some way skilled up riggers can convert t1 rigs to t2 with the materials and locking the ship into an ""overhaul"" job on sci+industry window. make it take a week. that's more sandbox.i am enjoying this fun change just like a vaga pilots who kited t2 light drones/webs/neutranges/missiles/gunfire ...but i gotta support this thread. the right thing and the fun thing are never the same thing.you can fit 3x rig to any t1 cruiser even if you should run out of calib on the important/dangerous additions. e.g: rig for tracking,damage, and range, fit t2 pulse harby/zealot. game. cheaper rigs are boosting max/min in eve, that is the definition of game-breaking and auto-include. i used to think about rigging my razus but at seeing the new ratios that ccp chose(don't even scale dynamically lol) i'd be a damn fool not to slap 2 on.no amount of player talent will save your inty from a rigged rifter. that breaks the game as rifters with t2 could already gank t2 frigs.and nothing in the old/new rig system stops dps rigging from stacking properly. some crafty griefer is already looking for a rifter v af duel. and in no way should you nerf rifter, it's perfection, incarnate. it's just more perfect at less cost ratio. change the ratio.why do they get all 3 that affect dps on a nano/buffertank/any setup?because the system is broken. calibration points do not run out.pilots do not need to think about other ways to boost ship.btw, why are rigs even affecting modules on the ship, i thought they were built in simply to improve hull?? stru/arm/sh/hardpoints/launcher mounts/lows/mids/high rearrangements, or do those come in t2 rig expansion of this miniprofession??"
9/22/2009,"i've not read all the posts before me, but i totally love the new cheap rigs. doesn't make sense to put 15m of rigs on a frigate, totally makes sense they're more expensive the bigger ship you have.absolutely love them. makes a headache for manufacturers having to do more stuff, i just wish this was the case from day 1 when i couldn't afford to lose a badger!"

9/22/2009,"i support this with the following caveats:- either tracking disruptors should not be scriptable to affect missile explo radius/velocity, or amarr recons should not be given the bonus to the missile side of of it.- tracking enhancers giving td level bonuses would essentially invalidate tracking computers (which makes for a huge nerf to shield tanking snipers).-liang"
9/22/2009,current situation: as it is right now you only get an alphabetical list based on station name for selecting which station you want to move your clone to. this does very little for revealing where the station is located. the lack of information is problematic when you want to pick a specific region to relocate your clone to. you can right-click and show info on the location but the steps are unnecessary. proposed solution: show the region the station is in within own column in the list.

9/22/2009,"i have seen posts about stocks and shares and the mention of contracts.all too excel-spreadsheet and complicated if you ask me.i would want to try to simplify eve when we add functionality.i suggest that we simply allow corps to go 'public'. have an initial offering of shares that can be traded on the market just like any other comoddity. this ipo is attached to a written manifesto of why the corp is going public, what it hopes to achieve and indication of if it is a growth share or income share (it will just aquire other corps and grow and/or will provide a dividend for the investment).these shares can be issued by the votes of directors, and voting rights in corp actions can be achieved by owning 10% of a company. one vote per 10%.so directors have to be careful about continually issuing shares.corps need to state what their projected dividends are, and their ability to meet those commitments will affect their share price, by natural market forces.more shares can be issued on the market, but the corp has to compete with existing shares already in play, so can't be unrealistic, and have to attach a manifesto with their rights issue, and there are time limits on re-issues. to buy-back shares, corps can simply place a market buy order.corps could also (once every 6 months) split the shares to reduce the individual value and create liquidity.the value of the share is not the same as the net asset value of a corporation, and this will be harder to prove, but continual results should inspire confidence in the truth of the manifesto/accounts.i don't see the need for contracts or complicated mechanics. the simple eve-market will decide.for voting rights only 10% holding is needed to cast a vote. people should be free to sell their shares at any time, allowing greater corporate espionage.however, any holding that reaches a voting right (10%) or invovles a deal regarding a vote holder needs to be automatically published to the market to ensure insider trading is not masked, and that members with voting rights already are effectively making a statement when they re-invest in their corp.corps should also be able to publish their own news articles on successful initiatives (at their own risk of wardecs!).people should be able to look at the news history and share transactions of vote holders on the corp page.this vehicle would enable the 'eve banks' to invest in corps themselves more easily and spread the risk for individuals by providing their own shares and dividends at a lower rate.it would also be nice to couple this with changes to allow banks to operate more freely, for example, a loan system, where credits were automatically withdrawn periodically on an agreed interest schedule. it would be up to the banks to work out if corps or individuals are risky or not, and price their loan at rates accordingly.there.. that's my lunchtime over!"
9/22/2009,"i dont know if i'm the only one but the share system needs a lot of work. i feel like its not used correctly. for all i know, if ccp would do or create a whole complete share (stock market) system, they would need a big server and lots of ressources for that.my opinion, just remove the share thing..unless it has real use ?"
9/22/2009,"the current share system is far from perfect, but a lot of the proposals you outline would actually make it significantly worse. 10% to vote is silly, share-splitting limits are equally silly, and the idea that people will have confidence in share sales as a whole is just nonsensical. if you want a proper share system, take off the 2 billion isk dividend cap, allow shares to be traded via contract or some other equally open system, and create new tracking tools to let potential buyers see how the share has performed in the past. also, clean up the corporation window generally, so that people can actually use these new functions without tearing their hair out in a bout of ui rage."
9/22/2009,"while i hate hot dropping with every fiber of my body, i can't agree to these terms.however, cyno fields requiring a 30 second stability period would give pilots a long enough time to react appropriately, yet it would be short enough for the beacon not to get popped (if it's not on the same grid). instead of the current ""cyno!! holy shi... *static*"" we have now, it could be more along the lines of ""cyno spotted! redouble your efforts, we've got 30 seconds before all hell breaks loose!""another solution is to make the cyno beacon only be the centrifugal focus of a massive 0.5 au radius subspace distortion (military experts would call this a cynosural field). the capital ship could arrive anywhere within that sphere, and would be required to warp to the engagement manually.either one would be a fair improvement, but more anti-cyno modules would just be asking for trouble imo."

9/22/2009,"if you're going to make it a regular thing, just let players set their own skills. it'd allow for better testing, while eliminating the armageddon day server rush that prevents people from actually playing with their shiny toys."
9/22/2009,"it is ccp's server where they allow us to connect to help test changes. if and when they have something specific to test they always give skills/mods/hulls to facilitate testing.sisi is not a playground for us even though many use it as such, i would rather access be restricted to people who actually use it to find/reproduce the bugs that riddle this little universe of ours (ie. perma-bans really meaning permanent bans, as in forever and ever)"
9/22/2009,"interesting concept, fun. if restricted to a week or two per year, it wouldn't waste too much time. and this investment in fun might get more people involved with genuine debugging during the other 50 weeks. even major rl corporations have holidays, parties and the like. why not the test server! no one would have guessed that building rockets would give us tang; who knows where something like this could lead? it might be fun finding out!supported"
9/22/2009,sisi is the worst test server of any game ive played simply because of not being able to change skills. its literally ******.skllls should be changable or at 5 all the time so you know we can actually test things instead of waiting 2 and a half years of watching the imbalances wreck tranquility(hello titans and doomsdays)

9/22/2009,current situation: when a character is accepted into a corporation there is no record to show who completed this action. the same applies for removing characters from a corporation.proposed solution: add a history tab in corporation ui. and allow for comments so that a reason can be given which other directors can see within same corporation. also if a character has been in the corporation before a popup should indicate this when they're being re-admitted.
9/22/2009,"yup, life sucks when you have way too many people in your corp to keep an eye on."

9/22/2009,"i wish and pray to the ccp god that they give us players that use paragraphs and sentences.anyways, no. it is supposed to be hard to get things around in eve. hence, meaningful trade can exist. also, you can think about this beforehand and not leave stuff scattered all over the place, or accept the loss and continue. if you will never be able to get to the items and they are cluttering up your assets page, right-click > trash it so that it won't bother you any more.for meaningful suggestions we need to look at the issue from all sides. you are looking at it from a personal point of view. you just want your stuff back. i don't see why you should get it if you lost it in the first place. if another alliance took over a station you used to own and can no longer dock at, then not having access to your stuff is a valid loss. meaningful victories cannot happen without meaningful defeats.look at it from a corp/alliance point of view. your corp making a big move across the universe? there's massive logistics behind that move. freighters or many industrial/ship runs need to happen from all the players in the corp. with your idea a corp can now move effortlessly once a year. just place a courier contract to one trusted person in the corp and he can ""remap"" to place all your stuff in one station. (or you can each do this if you don't trust someone)now you have corps instawarping across the galaxy? no thank you.create courier contracts for your stuff and maybe someone who has docking rights (or access to high sec, if that's your problem) can move it for you."

9/22/2009,"i think it would be quite a nice bonus if there were some random loot drops from mining standard ores, just to make things more exiting.i'm not saying we suddenly find a modulated beam laser in an asteroid, but more like why can't i accidently get some amazing discovery of morphite or ancient fossil or sleeper artifact that was burried in the rock.just so it wasn't 'predictable' per hour/isk, and the miners get a smile to their normally dire existance being harrassed by griefers. odds could increase as you lower the security status, but i still think it should be less than 100,000:1 in 1.0 space. the item would be delivered to the cargo bay on destruction of an asteroid, not during a mining cycle."
9/22/2009,"i like the general idea, but i doubt it could work.i don't think they can mix ores inside a single asteroid, or hide objects.the mining could trigger an event that spawns a new object, though.i don't think it would be good if it were implemented into standard belts. better put it into exploration.i remember a similar experience - an exploration had me mine some arkonor (in high-sec even) upon which suddenly a spawn of rogue drones appeared."
9/22/2009,"thanks maz, but no way in h*ll will i go to kugut*sumen site"
9/23/2009,i support the suggested fix.
9/23/2009,"lol its getting late again, it took a while but this is what i came up with.youve been reading the other thread so i suppose you know what i'm gonna show ya :)well here is a version of the sheet with cmb's highlightedi dont know if it will convince you , but it the best i could come up with.pros of this approach imho include its replicable by anyone, so i cant cheat.its also a fair reflection of what pvp'rs are flying and how good they are at flying them, which reflects strongly on the abilities of the ships themselves.the raw data is not sourced from me so its not biased, the same formula have been used on each ship, so again not chance of me unfairly biasing the data.my interpretation of the data is like so.hawk: worst assault of 8drake: best bcnighhawk: 4th of 8buzzard: 2nd of 4caracal: 2nd of 4 ( a long way behind vexor )phoenix: worst dreadcni: best faction cruiser of 9worm: worst of 9condor: 2nd tier ii frig ( long way behind 1st place atron )heron : 3rd tier iii frig kestrel : 2nd tier ii frig ( very long way behind 1st place incursus )cerb second of 8onyx 3rd of 4crow 2nd of 8flycatcher 2nd of 4rook last of 4leivathan joint last of 4 ( no data )so from 17 ships , only 2 ships are best in class :(what you say in the post is true.there are other ways to fix cmb's individually.i think replaceing the kin bonus with a decent one would fix them all in one fell swoop without overpowering them. drake,cni and cerb might need some attention afterwards.but my opinion is this would go a long way to fixing the below par nature of caldari pvp."
9/23/2009,"well, all that needs to be said about your statistical methodology has already been said, so we'll just have to go on opinion instead.hawk: worst assault of 8. agreed - but the problem is hawk fittings and rockets.drake: best bc. agreed.nighhawk: 4th of 8. its problem is pg.buzzard: 2nd of 4. irrelevant.caracal: 2nd of 4 ( a long way behind vexor ). ok.phoenix: worst dread. it's the best at hitting pos and only suffers in mid-scale cap fights. with 30 phoenixes, they fire at their own dread targets, one-volleying each one, so no dps is lost in flight.cni: best faction cruiser of 9. it's good but i don't think it's the best.worm: worst of 9. irrelevant.condor: 2nd tier ii frig ( long way behind 1st place atron ). irrelevant.heron : 3rd tier iii frig. irrelevant.kestrel : 2nd tier ii frig ( very long way behind 1st place incursus ). roflkets.cerb second of 8. agreed.onyx 3rd of 4. irrelevant.crow 2nd of 8. ok.flycatcher 2nd of 4. irrelevant.rook last of 4. it's the best combat recon, possibly joint with the curse.leivathan joint last of 4 ( no data ). irrelevant.out of 17, i make 7 ""irrelevants"", two ""roflkets"" and one ""powergrid"". of the remaining seven, there are two ""bests"", two ""seconds"" and three others. i don't see a wide-spectrum problem with the kin-only bonus - other ships' problems lie elsewhere, in pg, roflkets and the silly frigate tier system. i'd advise that you looked at fixing those problems instead, rather than asking for a blanket change that isn't really necessary on the good ships and doesn't actually help the broken ones. and you can add the insane cpu requirements of large shield transporters to that list also."
9/23/2009,"supported ,no other race lose its bonus just by changing ammo type.if most ppl against it because kinetic should be caldari racial dmg then i have a solution for that:kinetic bonus should apply even with not kinetic missiles for example:-thunderbird heavy missile does base 150em dmgthen ships with kinetic missile bonus will do 150em dmg+ 5%/lvl*150 kinetic dmg which is at lvl 5 150em dmg +37,5kinetic dmg = 187,5dmg same as with scourgethis way caldari wont loose its dmg bonus due to ammo change and still has its kinetic racial favour."
9/23/2009,"i sure wish that i could switch my ogre ii's for a different damage type. too bad i can't carry 4 racks of heavy drones in my dominix.you shoot something with high kinetic resistance. you do ok damage. you switch your damage type to em damage. this does more damage than your kinetic bonus. you do even more damage than you did with kinetic. so on top of having this advantage, you want to do even more damage with everything. you already do. so please, stop posting.your level 2 vs. level 5 argument is flawed because ships have a pair of bonuses. even if you're not getting your kinetic bonus, you're getting your second bonus no matter what it may be.being able to switch your damage type is a third bonus in itself. minmatar damage type are dictated by ranges. gallente and amarr have no variation in their damage types.if you want your ""all around damage bonus"" then you have to sacrifice every other type of missile damage, or make them akin to minmatar ammunition in that they dictate range as well as a split damage type. then you can have your 5% to everything per level."
9/23/2009,"mr noob gallente whiner, look at this way:why does your domi get dmg bonus for light drones aswell??you shoot something with high speed/low sig. you do whatever damage. you switch your drone type to light. this does more damage than your heavies with bonus.you do even more damage than you did with heavies. so on top of having this advantage, you want to do even more damage with everything. you already do. so please, stop posting.also why gallente drone ships get dmg bonus for warriors , those are doing matar dmg type , so they should'nt. if they want to use faster drones they should have to give up their dmg bonus.i hope this cleared out how stupid your argument is mr gallente whiner."
9/23/2009,"i was using an example. if we were balancing ships around specific encounters this wouldn't be a very good game now would it. i have no problems with the dominix.my problem is people not realizing that they're asking for more of a buff than the ships need. if you read anything past the first lines of my post, you would know that. clean some sand out and try again.asking that a ship be able to be excellent at every scenario is absurd. thank you for proving my point."
9/23/2009,"i support this topic. it should be replaced with either a rof or damage bonus. but missiles need more fixing than just looking at the ship bonus.personaly i'd rather a damage bonus, as a rofb would just mean that when i go deepspace ratting i run out of missiles much faster, but being mainly pvp orientated, that doesn't phase me too much. rof bonus would also, for this reason alone (at least for 0.0 ratters) nerf the pve aspect of using missiles, at least in that aspect so that not so many people would complain about caldari being the best pve'ers all the fu*king time. the only ship thats really good for pve (lev iv's intended) is the raven anyway, and that already has a rof bonus so nothing would change.but really, put aside the allaiance tournament fantasy arena for a second and in the outside world, in gang or feet pvp, missiles just don't get there fast enough to be effective at the range that caldari are supposed to be aimed towards.eg: cerberus can hit around 160k, doing approx 400dps... but to get there you have to wait 25 seconds, so thats 25 seconds of dps that your missing, before damage is even applied.if while your missiles are in flight, you need to warp out, your damage gets turned off the instant you click warp to allign, even though you still see the pretty exlosions, unlike all turrets that will continue to do damage while they allign to warp, not to mention instantly rather than 25 seconds later.so yes missiles in general need to be seriously looked at, and the fact that the raven happens to be good at running angel missions is no reason to even talk about the fact that caldari happen to have a ship thats good at pve, because for all of the rest of us who don't give 2 flying pieces of turd about ***** carebares in highsec running the same repetetive mission rooms over and over when it comes to how weapons should be balanced, because popping 60 red crosses that don't need tackling because they are too stupid to just friking warp away already doesn't mean you can even get close to taking on 1 square while dealing with broken game mechanics"
9/23/2009,"i agree with the irrelevance of the dps of these ships they are not combat vessels.so a blanket change that terminates the kin bonus would not relly affect these.these are all combat vessels , the onyx and fly may have primary roles of disruption , but there dps is still relevent to there use especially in small/gang solo worki'll decline your advice for now because..i'm off the opinion that the main problem with cmb's lie in the poor damage bonus they recieve.roflkets wouldnt be so rofl if they got rainbow dmage bonus.kessies and hawks can also fit standards.more dps from a proper bonus on the nh would free up a low slot bcu > reactor control.as a ""breed"" of ships cmb's are underpowered, statistical analysis supports this.this is hardly surprising when mathimatical analysis of the bonus equates it to 33% the value of gun ( rof and damage ) bonuses.stat analysis also shows that the current rainbow bonused ships are not favoured for pvp.the information is there if you care to download it ( 0 - hits so far ) :(."
9/23/2009,"how do you figure? all other races (gallente, minmatar, and amarr are pretty much restricted to two damage types either way, em and therm for amarr ; kin and therm for gallente; minmatar is a small combination of em, explosive and kinetic iirc, but only two.caldari have the benefit of being able to choose a pure damage type to deal damage in, you want to destroy and armor tank? fit explosive missiles, you want to take down a shield tank? switch to emit's balanced as is.gallente do therm and kinetic, alot of therm and kinetic, but they need to be extremely close to do that, their drones help make up for that lost dps while fighting at extremely close ranges.amarr, they are restricted to em and thermal, but their benefit is that lasers have extremely awesome tracking, they do almost as much as blasters, at much farther ranges, that makes up for their em and thermal restrictionsminmatar have it rough, but i know most people use rf emp ammo, which is em and explosive, their benefit for autocannons low damage potential is coupled with their quick rof, and alot of minnine ships have the slot layout for missilescaldari have missiles and can choose to completely focus their damage type and still have quite awesome ranges and damage potential. you want caldari to be the i win race, i see that little 'caldari ; pvp ; solo ; success, choose three'you can pick caldari, pvp and success, solo pvp is hard to find these days anyway.missiles arent affected by tracking, and it easier to help make up for your lost damage output agains nano ships for those times you decide to use a raven to pop a cruiser with torps, use a damn target painter, it's alot better at what it's designed to do than tracking enhancers to their turret counterpartssorry man, but that kinetic missle damage bonus is helping keep the balance.not supported."
9/23/2009,"dude read the op , not some random sacrcastic reply.this thread is about the ship bonuses and there incompatiblity with combat tactics ,not balance between a and b.kinetic mdb is not helping keep the balance.it destroys the balance that would otherwise exist.caldari ships are not balanced with mini/gallente atm.the statistical analysis i did on pvp data shows a strong favourtism towards mini and gallente ship by the top pvpr's in this game.damage type switching is not some sort of god mode."
9/23/2009,"your every post seems to say, ""do you agree with me? no? then you must be talking about something else because i am right."" the vast majority do not agree with you; there is no problem with the current design of caldari ships -- missile or otherwise.and your vaunted statistical analysis is fundamentally flawed; there are numerous posters who have said that in your other ""boost amarr and caldari"" thread."
9/23/2009,"no that post says ""dude read the op , not some random sacrcastic reply.this thread is about the ship bonuses and there incompatiblity with combat tactics ,not balance between a and b.""no the vast majority ( gun and drone users ) have a vested interest in keeping things the way they are now.and your vast majority isnt really that vast , mostly the same people posting and reposting to try to get there arguments about balance through or more simply in some cases to try to derail this thread with noise.they will never convince me and neither will you , because my own cross trained experiance of this game tells me of the current supperiority ( all things taken into account ) of guns over missiles and mini and gal boats over caldari.when i started that stat analysis , i never knew what i would find.but i really wasnt surprised when it showed the extent to which experianced pvpr's favour mini/gallente.the stats are good , they show what they show, a pvp preference for mini/gallente.some peopple have ranted the stats are bad, without offering an explanation why.other have tried to look for faults and never proven anything."
9/23/2009,"you have tunnel vision. the statistics are fundamentally flawed in terms of sample selection. there are well-reasoned responses which state what the flaws are, but you have steadfastly ignored them.it is the same here; you state over and over again that the bonus should change and that it is not a balance issue. that is quite patently false, a bonus is a game mechanic and therefore by definition a game balance issue.there is no malice in my statements, and if you read any there then you have read too much into them. you are, quite simply, wrong."

9/23/2009,"it looks to me as though he did in his last post. of course it is ratherdifficult to tell where the questions he is ""evading"" are since the posts you mention seem to be comprised primarily of bullets depicting your unsubstantiated views. maybe i just need to l2english but it looks like he covered everything.pattern: i've been trolling the shc topic for quite a while. this latest iteration of changes look good to me when one considers the objectives you are going for and the hurdles that accompany them.supported."
9/23/2009,as ccp is truly working on this.. i will no longer post this anymore.thank you one and all for working with me in trying to get this pushed to the forefront.
9/23/2009,"i'd like to see them address hit quality, but otherwise i'm pretty stoked. woot!"
9/23/2009,"honestly, i'm pretty stoked regardless of hit quality.-liang"
9/23/2009,"not supported as-is.i could get behind the idea of two consecutive terms, then two to three terms off before one can run again. this should help make sure that the truly talented csm people can still contribute after their 2 terms and that we're not scraping the bottom the the barrel due to term limits.i would just prefer seeing people not become entrenched in their positions on the csm and i think having different people and diverse/new ideas flowing through regularly is best."
9/23/2009,"we could give the csm a unique luxury yacht, too, so they can fly around the cluster in style. can't have our elected representatives feeling cramped on their way to jita."
9/23/2009,yes yes yes. i would also love the option to allign to bookmarks
9/23/2009,2 thumbs way way up!
9/23/2009,as much as i hate people not aligning when they are told to in fleets i dont want everything being done for them. teach your people to listen dont make fleets afk endevors. not supported
9/23/2009,<.< afk?have you ever managed a fleet of about 50 to 100 people?seriously... think about this before you make assumptions.
9/23/2009,"definitely not supported!what is the next you'll ask for? that you can target and focus fire for ships in the fleet?good fc's and alliances manage to get their people to follow orders, and benefit from it. bad alliances don't and shouldn't be given an easy way to make up for their own inadequacies.@drake draconis: if you can't make your people follow simple instructions like 'align to..' then you are the one failing, not the game!foolish suggestion!"
9/23/2009,"and yet, they included warp to...."
9/23/2009,"warp to has a function besides being lazy, it allways your fleet to hit at the same time, at the same place. besides, good fleets have their members warp to optimals anyway when not on the move."
9/23/2009,no i havent but i have been in them. i wasnt saying that happens now but i am saying if we keep giving more automation to fc's thats what it might become. for example if we had a jump fleet button fc would be able to completely move their fleets without having the need for anyone to listen. the people that miss alignment when being chased by hostiles are the people that get caught at killed. i just want to keep some responsibility with the individual. i think thats a fair criticism of the proposal.
9/23/2009,"also a shoot at option? would be way easier, before an op you can just bring your bs to form up pos, then you can sleep, ride bike, etc, and when you come back the fc played his rts and you can get a new ship."
9/23/2009,"not as foolish as the one who assumed i was asking for more than ""align fleet too""now go run along lemming and continue to blame all of your faults on the fleet commander."
9/23/2009,"consider this.. you're in florida, two rival gangs kill each other on a daily basis, but because they handed a bit of paper in to the police/government that said ""this is a war"", the police and government do not investigate the crimes or arrest offenders.that is what wardecs really are when applied to highsec.so they do not really fit. outside highsec, wardecs are unnecessary, as you can do what you like and turn people 'red'.in terms of eve dynamics, consider this, in empire space, do you really think that because corp a declares war on corp b, that the governments and concord are going to turn a blind eye? this makes no sense whatsoever, there would be mass protests. go write a chronicle about that!you have nullsec.you have losec.you have suicide gank.you have can flipping bait traps.you have disco-raven outside jita 4-4 or niarja.i don't see what purpose wardecs have except for people to harass other players corps and stop people from having a break. the main issue i have with this is that i pay to play, and it limits my choice if i'm station camped in highsec. (not happened for a while as i live in a wormhole!).not everyone wants to fight, and the griefers have multiple options already.this is one of the most annoying features of this game for casual players... i log in, oh, i can't play. why pay?"
9/23/2009,"definitely not supported, eve is a harsh place, and non consensual pvp is one of the main features. if you don't like it, can i haz your stuffs?"
9/23/2009,"it would appear that for some reason ccp dont agree with you lino..over the years many people have raised this issue only for it to turn into a flame session between the people doing the wardec'ing and the people doing the defending.the origional concept/blueprint for eve was to create a game were people could run around and kill each other all day long... it would seem that this is still true.having been on the recieving end of many a wardec i understand how frustrating it can be to log in just to find out your station camped,,but it has also been my experiance that eve however serious other people wanna make it is just a game after all and blowing up other ships is part of that game and i personnaly have spent many hours fighting and blowing up those people who wardec'ed my corp.tho i do agree with you on a few subjects you raised.you have nullsec.you have losec.you have suicide gank.you have can flipping bait traps.you have disco-raven outside jita 4-4 or niarja.i don't see what purpose wardecs have except for people to harass other players corps and stop people from having a break. eve is a massive game and i personnaly see no reason why there is a wardec system other than to harrass and grief new fledgling inexperianced or carebear corps in highsec.but on the other hand...eve was designed so we can go and shoot other players and no amount of forum posting is gonna change that."
9/23/2009,* facepalm *hello kitty is that way ----------->
9/23/2009,"wtf ? wha ??? if people go seem y last posts they will know (doesn't take an engineer to find out) that i have a small tendency for being a carebear.. but not fully, i love killing people.what you propose is ridiculous. that will never happen. the game was ment that corporation could declare war on each other. plain and simple. its the main feature of the game and always remain.but the way it worked before was pretty good since the majority of players were only hardcore pvp'ers and it did work. over time, many other types of people joined which had different opinion and now we got a bunch of mixed people in eve. some don't even like pvp at all and never flown a combat ship (hard to believe but its true) and they play eve ???? wtf..whatever.your solution is not it... not supported. just like ccp did the sov...they will have to look at it themselves..no matter what happens it will change but they will. not us or even the csm will have no power over this."
9/23/2009,"wardec system is flawed, but the alternative is unthinkable ... no war.ccp do need to ban all combat from the hubs 0.9-1.0 systems. it produces an unnecessary amount of lag and inconvenience (4-4 bump-a-rama anyone?) and lord knows there are plenty of stations elsewhere to play the silly docking games at.tweak it by changing security status of the hub systems and removing all offices if need be. even in a post-apocalyptic world i am sure wal-mart wouldn't tolerate shoot-outs in their parking lot either"
9/23/2009,you morons need to stop comparing real life to a fictional world.
9/23/2009,"i'd support it if you had to pay huge sums of money to the government for ""mining permits"" and there were no missions in high sec.its super unrealistic that you can steal the governments minerals without filling out the proper mining paperwork. also concord should destroy any npcs that shoot you in high sec as well. its stupid that they don't."
9/23/2009,"real life != eveand wars can serve perfectly valid reasons, too, including but not limited to: - destroying competition in an area (getting them to leave) so that you can more fully take advantage of mining/production/pirating/exploration/whatever in the area you want to operate in. with enough war, you could possibly get them to move. - get back at them for can flipping/suicide ganking/smack talking you. - corps to make money. either mercenary corps, or pvp corps can make isk by warring industrial corps. if industrial corps don't have the means to defend themselves, they don't deserve to exist.and all this coming from a mostly high sec player who doesn't wardec without reason and spends most of his time doing carebearish things.and in terms of eve chronicles, yes, concord and the governments turn a blind eye. in fact, concord reviews all the wardecs to validate them. just read about it in the novel."
9/23/2009,yes... war-decs suck.it's a broken system to be sure.but removing them is not the answer... nor is buffing them... nor is any number of hundreds of suggestions (yes even my own) suck.this is why i have trouble making suggestions here because they always mess up the balance.
9/23/2009,"omfg, you make lot of sense, your a genius, please be on the csm team. your facts are so awesome"
9/23/2009,unless you have asked each and every person in this game who considers themselves a casual player about what they think about war decs you just told a big fat lie.i am a casual player and i have no problems with war decs. and why do people have to bring real life crap into this game? i do not give a rats ass about what two rival gangs in florida do for recreation.your idea for war decs needs to be flushed to the deep dark regions of the waste land.
9/23/2009,and get strung up by the lynch mob? not sure if i have enough structure to tank that.
9/23/2009,if you remove war decs there is no way to remove pos's from space that you might want to occupy. there are many other reasons why they are necessary but that one alone would break the game significantly.
9/23/2009,"wardec pvp is utterly lame.station camping - no thanks.picking on targets who dont wanna fight - no thanks.wardec mechanics are not good for eve and make no rp sense whatsoever.wardecs can mean misery for small corps who find themselves bullied by griefer / lamer corps 5 x there size or experiance.seriously who would wanna play that game , how many accounts has it cost eve allready ?i agree with the previous poster that there needs to be a way to fight over moon assets.rather than removing wardecs completelly they should be changed to enable combat at certain moons.teritorial wars are better imo than persecution wars.anyway with the options open for real pvp where both sides wanna are prepared to fight ( fw/low-sec/null-sec/whs )the wardec is becomeing the last resort of the lamer/griefer and could do with being looked at again."
9/23/2009,"speaking as a full fledged carebear who's entire battleclinc record consists solely of hauler lossmails (and a hurricane salvager loss too - and damnit, i miss that ship - this silly cyclone just don't cut it) - no. there is only one place in eve where you are really and truly 100% safe, and that is docked inside an npc station (and then only if you don't play the market or something like that). this is the way it should be.are war decs broken? absolutely and undeniably.do they need an overhaul from the ground up? aye, you betcha.should they be eliminated from the game? never."
9/23/2009,"i'm mostly happy with the replies. i expected the hardcore grief machines to seriously be opposed to this, then the odd random comment to justify it, and the balanced responses who understand the dilema and that the game is played by people who have different opinions that are equally valid as their own.totally agree that wardecs give an excellent platform to perform highsec pos-bashing. but lets ask what purpose highsec poses serve? since there's no moon mining, it's a glorified research and invention mechanism. if we allow more research stations in npc highsec stations, are highsec poses necessary? or am i missing something?the majority of eve space is 0.4 or lower isn't it? if war decs were removed, eve would still not be safe in highsec, as i explained. plenty of opportunity to disrupt corporate activity through griefing. it's not even that profitable in highsec, so to make money and hit people where it hurts, attack them in losec and nullsec. or are people frightened of the *real* players :-)"
9/23/2009,lies! (hides claw marks and wounds from last convo)
9/23/2009,what the heck is a *real* player? is a *real* player someone who resides in low sec or 0.0? are the ones who live in high sec all *imaginary* players? is it like real and imaginary numbers? i hate math.
9/23/2009,"while this is an interesting exercise, you have multiple problems with your data:you've taken the sample (already incomplete) from a biased sample -- that is, only those who have a ranking on battle clinic.not every pilot will choose to put their killmails and lossmails up on battle clinic.a pilot who puts his/her killmails up on battle clinic may not post loss mails, meaning the sample is even more incomplete.you've not taken into account the circumstances of each killmail. this list is as likely as not to be a ranking of ships which get picked first for a gate camp because they fit sensor boosters easier.there is potential crossover; when you count a ship as being lost because one pilot killed it, you don't take into account the possibility that another pilot in your list was also involved in that kill and so potentially count it twice.killmails can, of course, be faked."
9/23/2009,"1. would not introduce racial bias into the data2. would not introduce racial bias into the data3. would not introduce racial bias into the data4. i dont need to take into account the circumstances of each kill, to do that would require reintegrating the data for solo/roam/fleet/gankage kills.if i were to do that then i would be using my opinion on how important each aspect is. the data however complete should be a fair cross section of all activities in eve.gankage on gates may get lots of kills / but solo, small roam kills tend to score more on bc due to point being split fewer ways.therefore its not fair to assume that the peops at teh top of the leaderboard only every do gate camps.5. only if a player manually posted a km and managed to mess up somehow again would not introduce racial bias into the data6. would not introduce racial bias into the data"
9/23/2009,"er, what? have you taken a basic statistics class?1.people with rankings on bc are more likely to fly pvp oriented ships, which skews data. you can't say ""it's not racial"" because you have no idea. 2.a group of people who doesn't put lossmails on bc will skew data, as they could correlate towards a certain ship type (say mission runners who lose their marauders/battleships). since mission ships are predominantly caldari/amarr, this certainly does introduce bias.3. see aboveno, rejected, nein, terrible."
9/23/2009,"1. you know your completely right about that.so what conclusions do you draw from the data that shows pvp'rs flying predominantly mini and gallente ?me i draw the conclusion that mini/gallente are overpowered compared to caldari and amarr.hence this post , caldari and amarr need a boost.you may not like it and i dought you'll support it being mini. but thank you for making my point for me."
9/23/2009,"+1 for style, but -11 billion for thinking.for instance, my most often killed ship is a drake. now we all know that a actual fight between a pvp fit drake vs a pvp fit hurricane generally favours the drake unless the hurricane has a billion or two in impl"
9/23/2009,"who said anything about flying? you're looking at a killboard. your ""statistics"" are bogus and so are your conclusions. saying that something appears often doesnt make it overpowered. just accessible. you've drawn conclusions based upon false assumptions and little more than a home brewed formula that proves nothing. i mean look at your list for just a second - the exequror? the black ops being spread about by an entire list? it's nothing but bunk."
9/23/2009,"i was about to like spreadsheets but then you reminded me what ******s, people with spreadsheets can be...logic < wisdom.go get another sample pool you ****. can't believe you wasted csm reading time with this rubbish.also it's boost minmatar/gallente/caldari.minmatar need full turrets/full launcher/50/50 setups to not need 2 dmg mods...and l guns to not suck, and all their ships to fit either armour or shield tanks that change the use of the ship...armourtank stabber = heavy ewar, shield tank = nano tackler. they should both be viable as to grid/slots/base stats.gallente, need their 2 flights in dronebay minimum. and l guns to not suck.caldari need to be able to fit more ecm on more t1 ships and keep their crap launchers or allow missile launchers to fit 2 size caliber of missiles...amarr need their t2 tracking nerfed.play the game, avoid those misleading, biased data dumps.creating global ccp killboard thread, gotta search first.(that needs a fix soontm)also, make op player's character -10.00 until he redoes that spreadsheet.i hate him/her so."
9/23/2009,"you could just as easily draw the conclusion that more people are skilled for gallente/minmatar, so they fly what they know."
9/23/2009,"op is right it clearly shows that currently most pvpers fly matar then gallente ships. however this is being due to the past 2 years where matar/gallente ships were the best.amarr were boosted significantly in this year,so only need is to boost caldari and to some extend gallente for pvp.as amarr is op right now and matar is still good enough no need to changes there."
9/23/2009,"uhh, no he isn't?"
9/23/2009,"yep he isn't , is he?"
9/23/2009,the data sample due to its nature ( that being the combat record of the best pvp'r in eve ) will not not be full of fail fits.why you are singling out the drake ? there are ~200 ships in the list.the data only goes back 1 year.a = trueb = truec = opinionopinion is not a logical operator.
9/23/2009,"you dont want much do you !i laugh at miniwhiners who think they have a hard time.mini have the best ships in game < thats my opinion.the statistics support my opinion , not yours.there should be no more boosts for mini , they have it too easy as it is.high damage guns that dont use cap , and you still want more ?? :)"
9/23/2009,your opinion is just that... an opinion.i could stare at the screen and make an opinion off of a bloody pixel or a shadow or some funny funny mark on the damn wall and it wouldn't make it any better or any stronger than your opinion.i suggest you do some research on statistical analysis and then you should read up on something called the scientific method.when you come up with something that is unbiased... proven... tested... and not polluted by your opinion then you might have something.we are not interested in your damned opinion.we are interested in facts... proof... especially facts that do not originate from sources outside ccp's domain or the game itself.last i checked... battleclinic is not owned or operated by ccp... and they aren't watching everyone because i happen to know for a fact its missing quite a few kills and funny little things like that.so get that through your thick skull as you happily leap down the rosy path of spreadsheets.here we are at how many posts? and still only one support.must be nice to be a martyr for the cause.
9/23/2009,"praise be a sensible, objective, non-rant reply this may be true , then the question is, why does the data show a bias towards players skilled for gallente/minmatar when there are more caldari players in game ( according to official stats ) than any other races ? its not the case anyways, if you look at the raw data most players in the sample fly multiple races."
9/23/2009,careful - the bias behind your arguments is starting to show.
9/23/2009,"try not to rant.the data is not mine , it is unbiased by my opinion whatever that may be.the equations used in the analysis are applied equally to all races.i have not given you my opinion in the data."
9/23/2009,could have fooled me.
9/23/2009,"not really, no, not so much."
9/23/2009,"thanks you for sensible reply.most of the players in the sample, if you look at the raw data fly multiple races.its fair to assume that they are generally high skill point characters who have cross trained.i think that the data shows them choosing to fly min/gallente rather than being stuck with them because thats what theyve trained.any way assuming you are correct this would make the situation even worse than the data suggests.considering that nearly 40% of all players are caldari, why would pvp data show a preference for gallente/mini ships ?the swing to mini/gallente preference for pvp is even greater if you consider that only 19%/26% of players start out training mini/gallente skill.from the official statsthe offical stats in case you dont wanna go get them yourselve.of the 660,000 characters in eve, there are110,000 amarr (16.9%),243,000 caldari (37.3%),172.000 gallente (26%)127,000 minmatar (19.5%).these numbers are in almost perfect harmony with the racial composition numbers we published more than a year ago, showing very little change in preference."
9/23/2009,"i approve , lets boost caldari ship and amarr. there not good ""enough"". lmaocome on, flame me, i dare ya lol. you all know im right. who would use missiles anyway.. pfff. who would use lasers.. come on. way too much cap. dont use them for now. they suck/sarcasm/thread"
9/23/2009,"i'm trying to behave myself. sort of.first of all, your data population was only concerned with pvp'ers, not the game as a whole. of those caldari players, how many of them are actually pvpers i wonder? and, how many of that larger nubmer are actually active accounts and haven't been mothballed for three years.be that as it may, excluding the race of the pilot, we're back to your original assumption that ""people will always fly the best ship for the job in the game."" and i don't know that the premise is accurate.i don't always fly the best ship for a particular job - sometimes i fly a substandard ship because it's what i had available to me (i don't nmormally pvp but the comparison is accurate).additionally, my criteria with what makes a ship ""the best"" for a particular task may not match yours. by way of example: i don't use a hurricane to salvage, i use a cyclone. arguably, the hurricane is the better ship, because it has more low slots and thus can theoretically carry more cargo resulting in fewer trips to base while salvaging.. but it also costs nearly twice as much to acheive the same function (31 - 34 million versus roughly 19 million) - which is why i don't use it."
9/23/2009,"sample size 1000 ( this part sample due to player choosing ship )race a:400 ship uses ( 40% )race b:250 ship uses ( 25% )race c:200 ship uses ( 20% )race d:150 ship uses ( 15% )sample size 1000 ( this part sample due to only 1 ship being available )assuming ships are balanced availability should not have a racial bias so.race a:250 usesrace b:250 usesrace c:250 usesrace d:250 usestotal sample ( what we are seeing )race a:650 ship uses ( 32.5% )race b:500 ship uses ( 25% )race c:450 ship uses ( 22.5% )race d:400 ship uses ( 20% )ok theres a quick example of what happens to data when a random but equally distributed variable is affecting the results.if some of the kill/losses were due to only 1 ship being available for the player to fly, assuming that all races ships are equal the effect would be to reduce (mask) the size of the player preference.i'm not suggesting ^^ that happens btw not too any large extent.this is taken care of in the analysis.each ship is only compared ( for the popularity component of the result ) against its class equivelents in other races."
9/23/2009,"here's a statistic to analyze. 545 ppl (as of this post and assuming each person read it once which i know is already wrong) have read this thread and 1, one, un, ein, ichi, moja, has given it the thumbs up.and he wasn't agreeing with you, he was just flame baiting."
9/23/2009,"funny how all your ""ideas"" are nothing but trying to buff caldari when there is nothing wrong with them."
9/23/2009,"yes most threads on these forums go through the rants phase,they then have to go through the ""dude you havnt got much support phase"" , that tired old argument never works.0/10 for originallity in derail attempt.-1/10 for this one"
9/23/2009,"absolutely not, that would be ******ed, nobody cares about a drone.the fighter idea though, yes."
9/23/2009,some way to track the loss of fighters would be nice considering the cost.
9/23/2009,"only 1 supporter??!!to me, this seems as straightforward and obvious as an idea can be. the overview has all sorts of strange icons... explain what the icons are in a new tab on the overview. why isn't everyone giving thumbs up here???"
9/23/2009,"you have to organize the priorities in your overview settings...move enemies tag/effects to the top, neuts to middle, and pirate crap to the bottom.i still have no idea is mine works properly, as the new confounding bracket and background options are stunning if they chose to work, and my tabs don't always load...but i support this interface improvement. some varying ship icon brackets for shiptypes would also be very welcome. and better if each object had an interactive hud like rts games.less words, more symbols kthx ccp."
9/23/2009,"sure, wouldn't mind to have a ""legend"" of some sort to help understand it. doesn't hurt either so what the hell."
9/23/2009,"very simply, it seems that several months after their inception, wormholes have become a bit of a gimmick, at least on the strategic/economic side of things. now please correct me if this would have some negative impact on the pve content, but it seems like wormholes might become strategically relevant if they stay open a lot longer, and that this would be a good thing.anecdotally: when apocrypha first came out, and the possibilities were exciting, people spent a lot of time trying to find cool things like routes to systems on the other side of the galaxy, faster routes to jita, etc. sometimes these things were actually found and lots of scrambling and careful managing of what went through went on to try and get the most out of the discovery. i remember one point when a roving gang came through from the north into delve, and there was some extremely brief but amusing back and forth before the route closed.nowadays it just doesn't seem like anyone bothers that much. if a cool connection is found, it's not a big deal because it will be gone as soon as a couple ships go through anyway.i dunno, i get that wormholes were supposed to be the purview of small, intrepid gangs, but i think it would be really cool if they were even a little strategically relevant. i hate to keep using the jita example, but imagine finding a shortcut to jita that stayed open for a week instead of long enough for five ships to go through. that's long enough for people to add it to their routine, and for prospective pvp gangs to actually meet each other. and the change should be easy."
9/23/2009,"relevance is subjective. wormholes are quite strategically relevant to small, intrepid gangs, thank you very much./ben"
9/23/2009,"the time of the wormhole doesn't stop small gangs to form and go in wormhole. but the mass will. uhh, no. not supported"
9/23/2009,/facepalmsnot supporting a wh noob post.
9/23/2009,no
9/23/2009,ws > more dangerous than > 0.0 > more dangerous than > low-sec > more dangerous than high-sec.i think things are better the way they are.removing local from 0 and null would hand to much power to cloaky recons.going to the belts to mine/rat would be tantumount to suicide without local.
9/23/2009,"i'd support something like this, but i'd expand it to include: ships entering a system by means other than a gate (wh, covert bridge) don't appear in local."
9/23/2009,"you can load ammo from your cargohold into your guns, you can move items from your cargohold to corp hangar and vice versa, why not drones?i propose to have the ability to move drones from your cargohold to your drone bay without assistance of a ship with sma"
9/23/2009,"as a gallente player, i'll bet you do. but this will never happen. it would unbalance the hell out of all ships. each ship has limited done bays to give one an advantage over another. it also makes drone ships non-godlike, with unlimited some *cough*dominix*cough* would be the best ship in the whole game. as you would have an inhuman tank, all the neuts you want, and close to unlimited drones. (actually unlimited if you have an alt fly in and drop drones in a can.)"
9/23/2009,"comments:- a counter-balance to this in pvp would be that you could no longer carry so many cap boosters. cap boosters are the life-blood of eve pvp - a cargo item almost as mandatory as the mwd.- it would be terribly convenient if you didn't require going to a sma/station to refit your drones.my counter-proposal: when you eject a drone from your cargo bay, it ejects exactly one drone. it goes into space *as a drone*. you can then right-click and bring into your cargo bay. but, you can't do this more than once every 2 minutes (the same as ejecting anything from your cargo bay).-liang"
9/23/2009,"i, too, would love to have a 600+ m3 drone bay in my plated bs.either you're trolling or you just don't realize how bad your idea is.infinite drone bays!a valid tactic is to blow another ship's drones up to lower its dps.it makes people micromanage and it is one of the many things that make pvp complex and fun."
9/23/2009,drone ships should be able to expand drone bay by shrinking cargo.but taking from cargo directly to bay is too powerful.
9/23/2009,"yep by giving up a low slot or something at least.but no,they should not be able to refill dronebay in space.also it would further boost amarr ships as they usually have the most cargo space after ammo."

9/23/2009,just looking out for yah nid. o7
9/23/2009,wow someone loves me. no flame. no war... hihi
9/23/2009,"yeah, this is not a good idea, and definately would bonus drone ships way over the top."
9/23/2009,"funny, but i would have argued that it was a relative nerf to drone ships - especially those which receive drone bay increases per level.-liang"
9/23/2009,"fixed that for you. while the ops suggestion obviously doesnt work, your suggestion might without throwing off ship balancing. you should make it into its own thread though, this one here is burned."
9/23/2009,"originally, up until about a year ago, tracking disruptors did nothing to falloff ranges.unfortunately this pretty much made using them completely pointless due to the extremely short optimal ranges of blasters & autocannons and had limited effect on pulse lasers. ccp saw this as a flaw and made them affect falloff as well as optimal which actually finally made them useful to have.now, if you could script tracking comps to boost optimal *or* falloff that might be an idea, but since nothing currently uses 3 scripts that's probably not feasible (and would make minmatar snipers somewhat competitive with their contemporaries... something ccp seems highly averse to).as tracking computers are scripted to perform one function only (range or tracking) they are balanced and working as intended."
9/23/2009,actually the first problem is that you fail to take into account the single largest difference between the two.tracking disruptors are targeted modules.the computers and enhancers are not.the fact that the percentages are larger is part of balancing the fact that you can only use it on one person at a time.
9/23/2009,"ammo doesnt affect falloff , other than some t2's.so if you want to tc te to affect falloff then make antimatter/emp/multifreq to lower falloff to 50%. would you realy want that?oh and missiles already heavily penalized by sign/speed, there is no need for a module to completly make them useless."
9/23/2009,"tracking disruptor like the name says, disrupt the tracking (and falloff ???? for some reason). if you ask me, this small part with optimal and falloff should be removed. but thats another story and flame war lol.for the tracking computer. no problem there. if its active, it gives you more bonuses and if its passive less bonus. sure no bonus for falloff but its passive..want more do you want.for missiles, mhh, no. they already got lots of penalty and nerfing as it is...dont over do it."
9/23/2009,moar falloff plz!
9/23/2009,i dont what tracking disrupters to work on missles. that means thats what i have sensor damps for. i dont want somthing that will work onn everything i comeup against. well i kinda do cause them my arbi would be more usefull against caldari. but i dont want a fool proof solo win eve mobile i was balance.not supported(also can i have a special arbi with 8 lows and 8 meds ccp and lots of cpu and pg k thnx bye)

9/23/2009,i'm not asking to have bs and cruiser spawns in high sec belts but what i am asking it to see a bit more diversity to make it a little more interesting for high sec care bareshave roaming frig gangs appear in belts rather than the standard regional areas (as a rare spawn of course) so you could potentially find yourself under attack by a rogue drone group in amarr space or the angels appear. this stops people from setting up specific tanks and never having to worry about surprises. it also increases the odds of getting some of different salvage. the roaming force would be slightly larger than average and would group their fire more effectively to make it more challenging also warp scrams might be nice.ps i dont want to make these rat particularly rewarding for the person that kills them i just want them to be a little more deadly
9/23/2009,would be nice to make belts a little more dangerous for macro users and players in general. as long as its not ridiculous
9/23/2009,i don't give a sh<U+FFFD>t about passive tanked mission boats. i want a navy drake so i can watch all the vagabonds say ouch then run away.oh wait..... thats all they do already... oops
9/23/2009,i think tier 2 navy ships would be a bad idea. way to over powered.however !!!oneoneone1. i seem to remember from an old database dump that there were supporting faction destroyers and tier 1 bc's. i definitely remember seeing mordus legion versions of the cormorant and the ferox.would be a good incentive to get people out into low/null sec if these were only available from the shadier agents.
9/23/2009,"aye they put all sorts of strange ships in the dd that never make it to tranq.i remember seeing a ""pimp brutix"", got images of fist shapped ss with leopord skin paint job and pink fluffy adornments on the gun ports.as long as they fall between tech i and tech ii damage commands they would no be op."

9/23/2009,"im not a miner and i hate it. but 1 good use of the tier 3 is that its cheap. so if you get ganked in high sec you can replace it faster than your t2 variant... same applies in low/null sec.so perhaps the tier 3 is not correctly viewed by the community. lots of pirates and ""bad boys"" out there is that if they see a hulk afk, they will ""probably"" try to gank it. at that level you should know better than to go afk so this is not supported. but i do understand the logic behind it. you miners are not viewing it my way so your wrong"
9/23/2009,"i support the general idea, dont have enough insight to assess the proposed fix though."
9/23/2009,"i don't see what you're trying to say? this is _not_ a proposal that will decrease the number of afk hulks available for ganking. this proposal is to make the covetor a viable stop on the path to piloting a hulk.as it stands, retriever -> covetor is a about a month of training, and then covetor -> hulk is two more days. it makes no sense for people to purchase the third-tier barge when they'll only be buying a hulk two days later.however, people will still be training for the hulk because it's still much better than the covetor."

9/23/2009,not supported. the point of self destruct is to deny the enemy.
9/23/2009,"this.this is the same ""nerf self destruct"" whine that gets posted here every couple of months.no."
9/23/2009,"self destructing is a valid and strategic move, although only pansies use it.don't change anything about it except allow the killmail to go to whoever got the final hit off on the ship."
9/23/2009,rather nerf killmails
9/23/2009,get a fast locker with you and lock his pod... problem solved and **** him off lol.
9/23/2009,"no.instead, give out empty killmails (no fitting) with the self-destroyer as top damage dealer."
9/23/2009,self destruct should left no modules in the wreck :)also killmail should go to the highest dmg giver.
9/23/2009,"you complain just because you missed out on a killmail? really? you made them lose their ship. isn't that what you wanted?self-destruct serves another useful purpose. the client is prepared for a session change so it's more likely to escape in your pod. consider it as a gentleman's acknowledgment that you beat him.on the other hand, it would make sense for a self-destruct kill mail to mark the pilot that self-destructed as dealing the final blow, and others firing on him to be listed as damage dealers."
9/23/2009,"of course its lame, but thats why its so great. its the last chance someone has to control how things occur. if you can't field the dps to destroy a ship before it destructs, you don't deserve the km."
9/23/2009,"not supported.i've never done it, but i see it as a valid tactic and do not see that it needs to be changed in any way."
9/23/2009,"re-quotedif you can't kill them before they self-destruct, you don't deserve the killmail, pure and simple."
9/23/2009,"i say apply same rules for killmail as if npcs laid the final blow, yesincreasing the timer under agression is not good as self destruct is per design an anti griefing method: it allows you to get free from a situation you cant otherwise escape (e.g. if you are scrammed, webbed, permajammed but they dont kill your ship just hold you), turning that from 2x 2mins into 2x 15mins is not good obviously"

9/23/2009,"i'd say the current system is whole-heartedly floored and weak. the shares really don't mean that much except for votes and a lot of their uses are implied rather than being that useful and functional. they should be removed at a minimum, and a different 'succession' mechanism put in place before delving into the stock market. there is no need for an childish attack on my ideas. they are not silly at all. the 10% to be eligable for a vote is a suggestion to simplify the the rights of investors. it may turn out to be a dead end idea, but it's not silly. grow up.it maybe that stakeholders can relinquish voting rights if they do not care in day to day activities (like a bank). you also don't want every tom **** and harry to have a vote because they have a share, but also when someone has a significant proportion of your stock, it makes sense they *can* have a say. the 10% is merely a suggestion on a limit. splitting stocks is a regular activity that occurs in stock exchanges regularly. the current investors get a multiple of their existing shares say 2 for 1, allowing more liquidity in the market and positioning the share price to a more affordable level. vodaphone regularly split its stock during the years.if you don't think having a game-supported functional share system tradable on the open market will not increase confidence in using shares, then you are mistaken. i suggested trading the stocks on the open market in my initial post. contracts are horrid things to work with, and need to be thinned out too in my opinion.as for cleaning up the corporation window, totally agree. it's a mess, and the role configuration management/simplification is more of a priority than shares/stocks."

9/24/2009,"crucifier, no more damage from lvl5 than from lvl2punisher, no more damage from lvl5 than from lvl2coercer, no more damage from lvl5 than from lvl2maller, no more damage from lvl5 than from lvl2prophecy, no more damage from lvl5 than from lvl2sentinel, no more damage from lvl5 than from lvl2damnation, no more damage from lvl5 than from lvl2and those actually cant choose appropriate ammo type to magically get a damage increase.i could as well list all the amarr ships that are losing out on one bonus due to it being a capacitor usage bonus (i.e. basically allowing them to fit their racial guns with no benefit at all), but that would be a lot of typing.in other words, a kinetic damage bonus is fine, and certainly a lot better than wasting a bonus just to be able to use your racial guns."
9/24/2009,"i see how you have obviously accidentally left out the massive range and damage differences for these charges that you also get.to put this into perspective for you, i refer to eft:to help with numbers, i will only use gun dps, drones are not factored into these numbers.megathron:x7 ion blaster ii's ; 2 magnetic field stabsantimatter ammo: 543dpplutonium: 497uranium: 452thorium: 407lead: 362iridium: 316tungsten: 271iron: 226ion blaster cannon ii optimal range (w/ lvl 5 sharpshooter) puts range at approximately 7500meterswith antimatter (still only thermal and kinetic damage mind you) that cuts range to approximately 3750 meters.with the longest range ammo possible from the selection you get a whopping 226dps @ 12kmeven if i add a flight of, for arguments sake ogre ii's into the mix, it only increase dps to 506, the drones do more than the blasters on arguably the most deadly blaster boat (sub cap, and 'affordable' for the average pvp'er)now, obviously, t2 ammo has to be factored in, sovoid (no drones): 633 dps ; (drones: 913 dps)null (no drones: 497 dps ; (drones: 777 dps)take into accoutn with void you lose half your tracking, which unless your shooting an mwd'ing bc or bigger, tracking issues, tracking sucks donkey balls with void, its why no-one uses it, hell, even null, which gives a practically useless 'range' bonus gets hit with a tracking penalty (25%), which effectively negates the theoretical maximum on a megathron (7.5% per level, 35% at level 5)now, again going back to eft.ravenx6 arbalest siege launchers w/ 2 ballistic control systemsall damage types and torps: ( i will admit a small margin of error in these numbers, as i had to add the skills in, i can't fly a raven in-game)dps: 481 (keep in mind, this is nearly double what iron ammo can do while still restricted to only thermal and kinetic damage)torps can go far beyond the 12km range you might get out of, more like 20km iirc, while being able to do any type of damage you choose, again, i emphasize the damage type restriction on all other races.so, missiles have the benefit of having the same flight time, regardless of damage type, while being able to choose the hole of any tank you can encounter (most probably explosive (for armor tankers) or em (for shield tankers). the bonuse you dont get for those damage types is balanced by two factors:-the mere fact that you can choose the best damage to deal-your damage types are not affected by extreme range and damage penalties-your not affected at all by trackingthose benefits are ofcourse offset by the penalties you do recieve.-hard to hit smaller since their sig radius is taken into account w/ explosion velocity-takes time to get to the target, he may be dead before your missiles hit (although this i would imagine would really only be a factor w/ the phoenix)and for the finale:yes, caldari do tend to suck at solo pvp, but they are the most beneficial fleet support ships imo, but even the solo pvp suckage is offset by the fact that caldari ships are the best mission runners in the game. and solo pvp is hard to find in eve these days, unless its pre-arrangedsorry man, still not supported."
9/24/2009,"double post:i feel like a dunce, my last post was comparing bs to bs, and battleships were not your concern when you raised this topic, but my general argument still stands, the pros of missiles vs. it's cons compared to the other races is acceptable."
9/24/2009,":)yeah the raven is not a bad ship.your eft numbers for dps get a 25% boost from the rof bonus.i still think mega has the edge tbh.swapping ammo in a rave takes 10 seconds per try and unless you have the right ammo loaded to start with you lose a hell of a lot of damage on target , either by swapping out or sticking with sub optimal ammo.its hard to guess in battle whats gonna be the best type to unless you use split launchers and watch the log as the hit values come in.in a gun boat you can see range and direction to target which are the priamry concerns for gun boats.i dont use ogres when flying a mega , i useually go with either praetor or berseker , but that just me i like to spread my damage types out as much as i can."
9/24/2009,"i admit i've always been mildly irked by the idea that missiles need lower damage than guns because they can pick their damage types freely...and then caldari ships often lose a large chunk of damage by switching away from kinetic ammo. it would be 'nice' to see the missile bonus apply to all missiles, the way gallente drone bonus applies to all drones and not just thermal drones. but i don't know that the *really* sucky caldari ships (hawk, worm, raptor, nighthawk, flycatcher) are bad because of their kinetic bonus. generally they are bad because of lack of fitting or because frigate missiles in general suck, kinetic or not.i don't know that this would really remedy any glaring balance issues. seems more of a 'fixes nitpick' issue."
9/24/2009,/supported.. give dessies some love.. i so wanted a dessy to be the next step up from a frig but was severely dissapointed when i had the ability.i can live with the pathetic shield if they get a 50% damage/range bonus but only use 8x75mm or equivalents and maybe some insane web-range bonus to fulfill their role as frigate/drone destroyers... or increase the tank and remove a gun. something needs to be done. totally agree with that!

9/24/2009,"while i can fully understand that a person with the name evilphoenix wants a name change * grins * i am not in support of this idea.in eve, you are who you know and you are identified not just by your character, but by your name. i know some people change characters every 14 days, but most of us stay with our mains - and their names - for the rest of our eve lives.live with it."
9/24/2009,"i had something typed up, but then i realized saying it could get this thread deleted and my account temporarily banned. such is the state of my confidence in ccp fairness. i'll just say this:it's said the company is basically a lan party that got out of hand. there's strengths and weaknesses in that. one of the weaknesses - lan parties are cliques. cliques pursue personal vendettas. cliques don't like to punish their friends. ia was created in part to mollify player concerns that ccp operated more as a clique than a company. actions like what prompted this thread argue that ccp is still acting very much as a clique. none of this affects me personally in the least. it's just kind of embarrassing to see."
9/24/2009,overwrought or not i'd rather not have ccp employees going around and trying to find out who active on private websites in this manner.
9/24/2009,sure
9/24/2009,"or i post a picture on forums and log ips accessing it. your ip address isnt exactly private, every internet advertising company has an enormous database with everywhere you go basicly to determine what to advertise. although i dont think i have to explain pl anything about getting ip addresses."
9/24/2009,so you would be okay with another t20 like affair because you would rather ccp did not try to prevent it?or do you have a list of private websites which should be exempt?
9/24/2009,there is a difference between ccp employees doing security stuff with the server log and isd volunteers doing it.
9/24/2009,"i wonder how cyvok's connection is doing nowadays.3 years away from the game after ther t20 ****fest and now this, one week after i resub.wtf"
9/24/2009,"the sky is falling...made up drama eve players love so much. request it when you've a real reason, and anyway you're not going to know anything they don't want you to know (frankly, you shouldn't). it's all in the contract you sign-up when you start playing, there is the info on what data is compromised or not, go read it and stop making up drama. if privacy was so important or you where so scared in the first place you wouldn't give a private company your billing info, but yo do, so?"
9/24/2009,sounds rather unprofessional.
9/24/2009,"the problem isn't so much the fact ip's have been exposed, but that they can be linked to:-peoples billing addresses-in game character name's-accounts on 3rd part websites, like forums.something that should in no way effect eve players in game, now is.and the fallout is people are being victimized because of in game events and allegiances because their identity in game has been linked with their identity out of game both in real life and on 3rd part websites. this leak of what is in reality sensitive information in the context to which it was presented (specific ip addresses of people accessing a 3rd party forum whom are eve players, being run aganst irc records from coldfront.irc.net; the irc channel where people are have account issues on sisi dealt with that require telling someone from ccp sensitive information like account names) has reportedly been occurring with full knowledge of isd and bh and ccp ginger."
9/24/2009,"somehow i dont get it... why someone would focus only on kugus forums and comparing to devblogs?i mean wouldnt that mean that the person is against kugu forums and he wants to harm those forum users? amd if ccp has known about it, its more reasonable that they ordered it for some unknown reason instead to make their hands dirty?but then what they would use those ip for?"
9/24/2009,"kinda funny that the people who are in shock and awe and are going emo over it are the ones flaunting about how many forums/ts they have access to. mind you, i do not at all condone what's stated in the op (if it happened) but pot kettle etc."
9/24/2009,not to mention the total and complete lack of common sense.i maintain several forum boards now that are tied to eve... but none of them are directly tied to the game.people who do not think things through when it comes to security refuse to accept responsibility for there stupidity... instead they blame ccp.that and the fact this whole damn <semi-thread> is based on something isolated over isd and not the overall population.hell for all we know this probably started because someone stupidly clicked on a keylogger link.
9/24/2009,i am quite sure isd dont have access to billing addresses (wtf should they do with them?)
9/24/2009,"as far as i know they don't, but you can glean a lot about someones identity from an ip address sometimes.admittedly one is making the assumption that the individual that pays for his internet connection is the same person that plays eve, but in any case that's likely still the address of an eve player isn't it?"
9/24/2009,"how do you get from ip address to billing address of isp? only works if you got someone working at that isp/access to their database, but if you got that allready anyway then you dont need some ip addresses of people coming from a certain site since that is all allready known. you cant just go from ip address to billing address (if you could those anti-pirating organisations would have way easier task if not every isp would block their requests for addresses when they have only ip address)."
9/24/2009,bumping this for great justice.we require more feedback! :d
9/24/2009,"uhh, i usually turn my audio off in eve because its not ""good"" enough or i just use my mouth for various actions. but thats not a good idea over time, my monitor gets wet from my overly exagerated spitting. so the only thing i can say about this is go watch some sci-fi shows like startrek for example. thats the kind of immersion i'm talking about.ok sure, its not very useful but i love the sounds in these sounds in these shows"
9/24/2009,i love you mazz!edit: and your ideas too
9/24/2009,"this sounds like a really good idea. would simplify the process and should speed it up. you would need a median price for these services, but shouldn't be to hard to figure out, maybe around 350m-400m isk to transfer a toon which sounds about right since a gtc costs $35 us and 30 days sells around 300m isk"
9/24/2009,and just like they did with fan fest tickets. so the code is there or should be trivial to code. great idea.
9/24/2009,hiya astro!
9/24/2009,aye to the minmatar race!
9/24/2009,x me up scotty!
9/24/2009,"i have to agree on this. ccp almost never follows player requests, even very well thought out and discussed ones such as this, but rather their own idiosyncratic logic, and my biggest fear is that ccp will do something like the falcon nerf in the form of one element being improved, such as the +50% arty clip size (although this alone would be a good start).ccp have consistently disregarded the minnie bses and large projectiles over several years now, while other fotms come and go."
9/24/2009,/supported.i actually think lino's pretty spot on.
9/24/2009,you're implicitly assuming that eve's social and moral structure is anything like that of western sururbia.it isn't.
9/24/2009,"let me demonstrate a use of a war dec tactic that's not griefing.corp a lives in dead end system and mines/rats all day. it's a high sec system, so when corp b moves in and encroaches on their source of income, they have a dispute. corp a war decs corp b and chases them out of their territory, and continues to profit.and that my friend, is how you use a war dec. get what you want, make others suffer. welcome to eve.personally, i view war decs as a way to prevent bordom by killing idiots like you."
9/24/2009,"i don't think so: the wormhole is just a natural phenomena that connect 2 distant spaces, so you traveled through the wormhole and you got in a far away solarsystem, that's all.you can't live 'inside' a wormhole...."
9/24/2009,ok i'll bite lets get ccp to give carebears 5 systems where they cant be ganked and war dec's dont apply. enjoy the lag and enjoy beating 10000 other players to the belts before there stripped. good luck enjoy
9/24/2009,"well, at least i'd know where all the suicide gankers will be."
9/24/2009,"you can, however, look like an over-educated idiot by arguing semantics that aren't even important to the conversation at hand. seriously, give it a rest. i refer to it as living inside a wormhole too. people knew what he meant, and that's really the important part about communication, innit?"
9/24/2009,"your reasoning is horrible, but i agree. not for the reasons you've listed, but because the whole mechanic is broken. no one has come up with a decent, balanced fix for this mechanic, so i don't see why we need to keep it.and before someone says: ""wardecs are fine"", let me list some points;1. corp hopping2. npc corps3. no consequences for either side (i don't give a rats bum about ""real life < eve"", wars should have consequences)4. neutral remote reppers5. alliances (multiple problems here)6. wardec limit7. wardec price structuredo i need to list more problems? as op metioned, there are other ways/places to get your fix. imo, all this mechanic does is create more lag in highsec empire. those that ought to move on because they want pew pew won't, and those that stay because they don't want to pew pew keep encourage the others to stay. remove the mechanic, and the problem is gone. simple.want the mechanic back? fix it."
9/24/2009,you would be the last person i'd expect to support this.yet your logic is scary.... it makes sense.problem is... it will never fly. but i'm sure you knew that.
9/24/2009,"i would maybe support this if in exchange all l4 missions and all asteroid belts are removed from hi-sec, and alliances with 0.0 sovereignty are allowed wardecs within empire."
9/24/2009,ccp should make a pve server so they can dump players like the op there instead of letting them pollute tranq.
9/24/2009,ccp should make a pvp server so they can dump players like you there instead of letting them make every other player look stupid.seriously.. take your childish trolling and take a hike.we are actually have a constructive war-dec discussion and your frakking it up with your stupidity.
9/24/2009,"no thanks. mayhaps, take a look at this link, my good sir?"
9/24/2009,i'm just puzzled as to how you actually got someone who isn't an alt to give support to this thread. how did that happen?
9/24/2009,"in this case i am not just talking about graphical effects i am talking about actual physical effects to players ships in specific areas, this was mentioned some time last year during fanfest( i think don't quote me on that)where nebulas, asteroid fields would have tactical meaning to them, what i am suggesting here is to add effects to specific areas of space but nowhere as drastic as the ones that are found in some wormhole space but just enough to give that extra bit of edge for people who know an area, for example in specific areas of space for a few systems it looks like your in the middle of a nebula and is unique to that specific area of space, so for instance for one constellation it may be in a nebulae that reduces sensor efficency and reduce lock times and lock range by a small amount say 5% or in some areas may effect shields reducing sheild recharge by 3% or something for a certain area, smaller concentrated areas of nebula like the ones you find in deadspace areas could have more sever effects from the reguler constalation wide or regional ones.another environmental effect could be in a certain radius from planets where the gravitational forces could start coming into play so for instance when your in the gravitational pull from a planet there could be a speed and agility reduction penalty due to the extra thrust needed to stay on the currant course witch would be more of a problem for ships with a larger mass but less of a problem for smaller craft with less mass giving an advantage to smaller ships, this can occour alot while fighting at stations pos's and outposts due to them being nearer a moon or planet, different planets would have a different level of effect based on the size and type of planet.these are just a few examples of passable uses of environmental effects, others could include thermal resist reduction while flying close to a sun, effects from the deployment of titans on the field from the large gravity well they are supposed to generate witch might make fc's think twice on deploying multiple titans on the field.of course alot of the suggested are open to debate and i believe it would be something very much worth while seeing in eve giving space a more unique feel to areas of space and give an advantage to people who know an area well."
9/24/2009,"mostly because of two things - most drakes i meet out there are failfits - because they are flown by mission runners, npc-ers and caldari nubbins (which is the most common type of nubbin in game) - and the drake itself is one of the meaner battlecruisers.so battleclinic only ranks you according to the last year? last i've seen, it doesn't - i'm 121st or so, and i haven't been playing in the last 9 months.the selection criteria for best pilots skewers the data, since it includes training/etc choices made before the rather significant changes in eve.c can be proven by testing / running the numbers / results of skilled pvp fits vs skilled pvp fits. in fact, it is rather obvious from the spreadsheet, unless you really insist on claiming the bellicose is a better ship then the blackbird, in which case i must conclude your trolling score is not that bad at all."
9/24/2009,"right ok i think i understand what your saying.let me just clarify something here.the data set i drew from bc was the data set of kills and losses of competent pvp'rs, i'm gonna call them top guns from now on so i have to type less text.the kills column is (kills with) i.e. ""kills the top gun has achived while flying a drake"" not ""number of drakes killed by top gun""the losses column is ""number of drakes lost by the top gun""so both kills and losses of the drake relate to the drake been flown by the top gun.the choice of top gun known ships data should minimise the numeber of fail fits in the data for any ship type.battleclinic ranks you on all data available over however many years youve been playing.the known ships data , from which i drew the raw data goes back 1 year.the best pilots are likely to have more sp than the average player and are more likely to be cross trained.lots of the raw data grabs shows pilots in multiple race ships.there maybe some lag in the data due to trained skills , but this dataset should minimise it compared to a dataset of average players.bb a good ship ? the ship otherwise know as ""primary bang dead"" ?"
9/24/2009,do you know why blackbirds get primaried?hint: it's not because they are worse than bellicoses.
9/24/2009,"the top ranked players on battleclinic are mostly solo pvpers as well, which would heavily skew the results. considering that gallente/minmatar tend to be alot better for solo/small gang."
9/24/2009,"so you get better results if you fly something largely useless to comparison to its peers, but ninja yourself on killmails and gtfo in trouble rather then fly something which is so useful that switching primaries to it if you're in any position to fire on it (eg, in range, fast enough, etc) is a no-brainer? interesting idea of what is a ""superior ship"".obviously the bellicose needs a heavy nerf to be on par with the blackbird. may i suggest 20%/level ecm strenght bonus and two more mids? in fact, i fully support that nerf to the entire minmatar ship line. we'll suck because we're insta-primary."
9/24/2009,"i think your completely missing the point.the bb is can only ever be considered a good ship when some one else is flying it.it the ""noob meat shield"" ship of choice uses its mids for ecm and is left with what 2 low slots to tank with maybe bb would be a better ship if it had less mids and more lows.i offer it as proof positive that the data set works, before you saw its position in the list you considered it a good ship lmao."
9/24/2009,op should try actually playing the game instead of playing with numbers.not supporting.
9/24/2009,thank you for the flamebump
9/24/2009,"the blackbird is a very capable ship with ecm bonuses equal to it's bigger less mobile and more tankable cousin the scorpion. please go and fly this ship before you make a claim that this is not a good ship.also would like to add that the only statistic worth while in this topic so far is that out of 64 replies there are 2 supports. one of you and one guy who did it for the lols.i suggest you just drop this topic as your not getting anywhere when you try and defend these current ""statistics""."
9/24/2009,the fact that you don't know how good the blackbird is is proof positive that your statistics are flawed and is almost certainly indicative of your ulterior motives for posting this thread.
9/24/2009,"woa, your analysis method is so bad (clearly proven by the ranking you present) it leaves me speechless.statistics are not just a bunch of numbers, the method in acquiring these is crucial to give them meaning.not supported, obviously.edit: about the blackbird, it shows your lack of knowledge while choosing your method. it is hands down the best ship in its class (t1 ewar cruisers) you can field, being shot down first in a fight is a clear indicator for that. and it gets a bad ranking for being primaried. method is fail, qed."
9/24/2009,amarr have been fotm for quite a while now and most caldari ships die to pilot errors (range is important!).that said ...... not supported.still waiting for your first useful suggestion. or is it all about trolling?
9/24/2009,"amarr bs are fine. amarr caps are fine. amarr bc are fine. amarr have one of the best hac's in the game. amarr cruisers have issues, mostly because of the silly 'tier' cruiser system and the omen being strapped for fitting in a bad way. the punisher is actually decent, as long as it uses auto cannons instead of traditional amarr weaponry. vengeance and malediction kinda suck, but that's because rockets suck. now, caldari have some fail ships in every category, seemingly, but also some good ships in most categories as long as you aren't trying to solo in them. they also have issues with frigs and crusiers not being as good as they could be due to the tier system. really, the bigest caldari fail ships are their frigates, because frigate missiles sytems are terrible. rockets are bad all around, standard missiles are too hard to fit. this causes issues with the hawk, crow, and flycatcher. the raptor is bad because it has way too little powergrid."
9/24/2009,"tbh, the days of the bleeder punisher are over for some time now. with the changes to warp scramblers and taking into account the fact it is slow and only has 2 mids, i prefer small pulses these days for their range.cap usage would be the only real reason for autocannons, with frigate lvl5 and decent gunnery skills it is almost negligible."
9/24/2009,"the only people who fly bb's are noobs who dont know any better and paupers who cant afford a falcon.the only time there anygood is when you have lots of them and not so many opponents , they die far too easilly. in fact i have to say i've never met a bb i didnt kill.your misconception that there good is probably based on you ( not flying a bb ) being protected by naive corp / alliance members flying them to provide you with ew and taking fire ahead of whatever ship you are flying.like i said bb's are good when there flown by someone else.drop this thread after 3 days ? dream on."
9/24/2009,i guess thats why you see so many former falcon pilots switching over to blackbirds these days
9/24/2009,"the analysis is fine. 95% of the ships are in the ranking exactly where youd expect to find them. there may be some weird out of place due to small sample size ( supercaps ) and a few like the bb which are counterintuitive at first glance.3 days i think this thread has generated more pure rant hatred than the rest of threads in the forums put together :)the real problem here is not the stats , there just numbers farmed from bc.the problem is people ego's ( mostly mini ) wont allow them to accept the truth.the truth being that there not flying the worst ship ( split damage whines / large ac comparison to blaster whines ) there actually flying the best ships."
9/24/2009,"and thats exactly the point. these numbers are by no means statistics, they are just random numbers pulled from bc, then you apply some unfounded conversion to get other numbers and present them as statistics.if you want to make proper statistics, you need a sound concept of converting the original data, which you clearly are lacking.just to give an example what i'm talking about, taking kills with a ship and comparing it against losses to create a efficiency ranking is completely bogus, you are ignoring the fact that the truly efficient ships are being shot down first.if we are applying stochastics to the problem, we will find that actually being shot down a lot while being used a lot is stochastically strongly dependant to good efficiency. in other words, your ""efficiency"" ranking is backwards."
9/24/2009,"ever heard of cost vs efficiency? seeing as your that much into numbers i would think so. the blackbird performs well for it's cost.a smart bb pilot will jam you and stay out of scram range and never engage solo. they are support ships not primary attack vessels.i primarily fly recon ships and heavy interdictors over other ships, i think i have seen my share of playing the ew/support role. however this is not about my personal preference now is it.now they suddenly are good or are you refraining to me because i know absolutely nothing about pvp because my battleclinic stats aren't as polished. those statistics could say more about how much time i actually spend on eve than how much i understand about it.time shouldn<U+FFFD>t be the argument to drop it the statistics should, what are you gaining from this? people with half a brain are not going to support your statistics. that's all it is, no idea just statistics and these statistics are not realistic either."
9/24/2009,"1) yes dude the bb's score is made up of one component ( taking its own stats into account ) and 1 component which uses the stats of other ships in its group as well.no part of a ship score compares it against more expensive or cheaper ships.while effectivness will be lower for cheaper ships , it will be lower for all ships in its group.cost of ships will not introduce racial bias into the data.2) i was not refering to you personally i have no idea what your bc stats showi was refering to the blackbird as a ship that is good when it is flown by another person.i.e. it is a nice ship to have along in a group , but no one in there right mind should be volunteering to fly it as there gonna get primaried and blown to pieces.3) of course times important , i knew this was tin-foil hat territory before i posted.people are gonna try to shout it down and not let it get a fair hearing , especially mini pilots.there afraid if this topic starts getting support there ships might get nerf batted , which is not what i am asking for.look at the posts so far , in 3 days i've been asked twice now to take it down.most people are just ranting, flaming and baiting hoping they can cause enough noise to make assesment of the information as difficult as possible."
9/24/2009,the stochastical analysis of the ships and all there parameters ( i'm not going to list them ) and any unknowns such as ecm [success|failure] and random gun hit success [ x1 | x2 | x3 ] plus disconnect and any other unforseen circumstances has allready been performed on the tranquility cluster.all we need to do is take the results of that stochastics analysis in the form of kills | losses of ships and look at them.in order to look at them some simple statistical analysis is needed in order to make sense out of widley divergent sample sizes for different ships.there is no need to do 2 stochastical analysies.
9/24/2009,"uhm, the results from fights on tq are not a stochastic analysis. they can be used as base data to perform such an analysis, but it has to be done properly or it is meaningless.any such analysis would require you to investigate the meaning and relationship of the original data. you didnt do that. what you did is just randomly converting the numbers.plus your method of selecting the initial samples is questionable at best.really, if you arent prepared to do it properly, this just looks like a troll thread.edit: i already said it earlier, your method to produce your ""efficiency rating"" is flawed, due to highly efficient ships obviously being taken out first in a fight. why dont you pick up on that and prove me wrong?"
9/24/2009,"agreed, some method of tracking at least lost fighters would be awesome."
9/24/2009,kill mails for drones too.and dont forget the poor missiles that get smartbombed before they reach there target we need km's for these too
9/24/2009,a method to track fighter losses is needed desperately.
9/24/2009,bump.
9/24/2009,the entire user interface is horrible tbh. let us now ponder the what 22 months of amazing jumping windows!still this would be an improvement!
9/24/2009,needed.
9/24/2009,i hate the tiny overheat button. its caused me all kinds of headache.
9/24/2009,"supported, buttons too tiny, and green bah. must be easy to come up with a better interface for this."
9/24/2009,"supported, we could really use a second light or something to indicate that the module will overheat when the cycle ends, and then the current light to tell us the module is in the process of overheating."
9/24/2009,agreed that the ui for overheating is not very user friendly.
9/24/2009,supported
9/24/2009,"as it stands, defender missles all target the closest incoming missle, no matter how many defender missles are fired. once the incoming missle is destroyed, the remaining defender missles allready in flight do not find another target and become useless. this makes defender missles not used very much at all. if you make it so that defender missles either all go after a different target, or automatically find another target if the target they where going after is destroyed, they would be far more usefull and would actually be a valid option for pilots to equip them."
9/24/2009,"defenders missiles are broken, period. they can be used, yes, but their functionality is an utter joke. ccp hasn't made any changes to defender missiles in over two years, and the one change they did make only broke them further.defenders need either a specific function while loaded, or a specific launching device, that is turn-on-and-forget. currently once you activate a launcher loaded with them they fire non-stop until there are no missiles in space and then... shuts off. you have to remember to re-activate once a new salvo is coming at you.likewise, because they move 12km/s they simply will not hit anything that's launched within 20-30km. they overshoot the target missile and by the time they redirect you've been hit."
9/24/2009,"i think missiles are fairly well balanced* right now, with defender missiles as they are. i don't see a reason to make defender missiles better*the exception is frigate sized missiles, which suffer from excessive fitting costs (standard missiles) to all round suckitude (rockets)."
9/24/2009,"how about removing defender missiles outright, no longer allowing vulnerability to sbs, and fixing tds and tcs instead?(not supported)"
9/24/2009,"i think it's funny to see all the people crying carebear tears here. both piwates and real bears keep crying about their low/null-sec going kaput. and all of them direct the starters and supporters of this topic towards the wormholes. you know where this idea started? yup, down in the unknown.even more funny is that in the wormholes you actually see both pirates and carebears, all doing their thing. and there, people are not running around like headless chickens, but are making coordinated moves together with friends.in the current low-sec people aren't even looking at their overview or scanner. they trust the info that local gives them: 2 scary pirates, 1 macro and 3 carebears in system... only then they start scanning to link ship types to the names.i would like to see local chat removed indeed. it would make the game more fun, more interesting and definitely more scary. whether a system is empty or not, you should fly through it with the same caution. that raven you have on scan... you should not know if it's a pirate or a carebear until you're right next to it!btw, the fact that a remove-local topic gets created almost every week says enough i think..."
9/24/2009,how many of these fail threads will you people create before you get the hint? local isn't going to be removed from low and null sec. get used to it.me and my corp could just as easily go out with alts and create daily threads that demand elves and magic be introduced into eve. would that make the argument valid? does that mean it's what the general playerbase in eve wants?the frequency of threads about one topic doesn't mean it's right.
9/24/2009,"my proposal is actually quite simple.make it so a player cannot change the name of a contract when linked.of course they will then link a contract and type in local that is something else. yes, the block button is a viable option still, but if you made it so single items like a raven contract cannot be renamed as a caldari navy raven in a scam then it ultimately saves on the database because you can block them without opening the contract in the first place thus reducing load on the market hubs."
9/24/2009,there's this thing that people do... can't recall what it is... has something to do with looking... or is it seeing... or is it....oh yeah... it's called reading!
9/24/2009,"dont click accept on contracts if you are not able to read for what ever reason (drunk, stoned, too tired)not support"
9/24/2009,"i will offer you some advice to avoid these scams without any changes required on ccp's part at all.1. click link for contract.2. don't click accept yet!3. click show info next to the item(s) being sold.4. answer the following question: is this what i thought i would be buying?5a. if 4 == yes, proceed to step 6.5b. else , mock scammer & proceed to step 8.6. answer the following question: is the price what i thought i would be paying?7a. if 6 == yes, click accept.7b. else , mock scammer.8. close contract.9. move on with life.as a side benefit, you will also stop being ridiculed in the assembly hall by those of us who follow the above process"
9/24/2009,"tbh, i'm all up for removing the scam spammage (no, i have never been scammed), but i don't think this is the solution. contract scam spam is like all the rubbish i used to get in my post box. it's annoying, and there's just no way to make it stop."
9/24/2009,yes.. stop the spam.... but not the scam as its a (cough)legitimate business in the world of eve.
9/24/2009,its useless full of garbage and useless tropics. lets remove it or make it able to post only directors and ceo's from corporations
9/24/2009,only open to ceos sounds good to me :)
9/24/2009,very good idea. i agree. also players caught using false corps just to be a ceo and post on the forum with alts should incur a forum ban.
9/24/2009,ceo's only sounds good i like it ^_^
9/24/2009,add c&p to the list of useless forums and you have my vote.the way i see it caod's just a c&p but for corps and alliances instead of just individuals. but in the end they both serve no purpose other than for epeen stroking. remove them both i say. this game could do much better without these forums. though i suspect the vermin would just move into gd :(.
9/24/2009,"the whole ceos/directors only idea is just silly, since the only thing it would do, is create a little cocoon in addition to caod. or are you saying ccp should start locking and banning all discussions about corps and alliances not done by the leaders? not bloody likely, since their goal is to encourage social connections and trying to get people to join player corps. the discussions by rabble about corps/alliances has to happen somewhere and it might as well be caod.no. if you are going to put the ceos only limit, then most ceos should be able to post. i'm a ceo of a very serious rp corp and should therefore be allowed to post there. ccp should not discriminate against small corp ceos. ccps forums are for all players, but if you don't like the community here, please make your own forums and continue the discussion there. you can kick and ban everyone you like there, but ccp should not get involved with such foolishness."
9/24/2009,this would make a drone boat of every ship.not supported.( <-- drone user )
9/24/2009,"many ships are balanced around the size of their drone bays, larger bays giving ships greater fleixbility and staying power than ships with smaller bays. trying to remove drone bay size as a limiter seems like it would involve a host of balancing issues, so i see no reason to attempt it unless it provides an equally large benefit."
9/24/2009,"actually, if you wanted to fix it, you'd have fixed 'eject from cargo bay'. anything jettisoned from the cargo bay gets ejected into a can. you can eject a drone, from the drone bay, and it be a scoop-able drone that you can scoop to your cargo bay or drone bay. you cannot 'eject' a drone from the cargo bay and scoop to drone bay. if you could, then op we would have his wish and we wouldn't even have this thread to chat in"
9/24/2009,"i'm not proposing all stations kick you out.but if you undock and fly away from a station, you should actually move away from the station. docking games are out of control and this is the largest factor why.i know this topic has prolly been done to death, but the reason that it's been done to death is because it's an issue.edit: forgot to support my own post... this started off on the wrong foot already."
9/24/2009,it's a 2 way street pal... the docking games also have a 2nd player you failed to mention... the station camper.am i saying its not a problem? no... but it takes 2 to tango[pvp]
9/24/2009,"as the ceo of a small corp i find that one of the tasks i use the most time on is locking down (and unlocking) bpos. to be able to lock down a new bpo, i have to do the following...1) attempt to start a research job or the like with the bpo with a char that has no research slots available so the job does not start. this process includes several accept windows, about 10 mouseclicks.2) propose a lockdown vote3) vote4) waitas the majority stockholder, i would like to have an extra right-click option for bpos - only open for ceos fx called ""majority lockdown"". the effect of the option would be to make the bpo locked down in one simple move instead of the 10 or so mouseclicks i have to do now just to be able to propose the lockdown vote.so, in essence - if you support a one click majority lockdown rightclick option for ceos, vote in support of this topic.thank youamanda"
9/24/2009,yes !bronte
9/24/2009,"it's funny you said that. i've actually used a playbook program to help explain ""game plans"" to people before. but it's so hard to spread them corpwide and and impossible for alliances. unles you force them all to do one and give you all their emails...grrr. i like your idea in the long term but for now i'd even settle for a beefed up specialized linkable paint program with built in symbols with the option to import more. it would need infinite scroll grid lines and the abilty to have pages and of course text. then a corp could link them in corp and alliance and practice them even when the coach ain't on."
9/24/2009,oh yeah..big thumbs up!
9/24/2009,"you might be thinking a bit ambitious in how it would work - automatic target splitting for jammer seems a bit crazy to me. that said, i like the idea. i've heard something similar on the strategic scale is planned as part of ambulation, though i'd definitely like it if a tactical version existed too. supported."
9/24/2009,"there will be a fleet finder addition to dominion, so we're going to see many more randomly collected fleets/gangs in eve soon. most of them will probably not have an experienced fleet commander. but even those who do could benefit from a battleplan program in eve to make sure that even not so experienced pilots in the fleet can carry out complex maneuvres simply because they will have instructions on their screens.also, if battleplans could be created and sold by players, imagine what kind of profit alliances like pandemic legion could make, selling their battleplans..."
9/24/2009,sounds interesting.
9/24/2009,"t1 cruisers need to become a viable option again, denying a whole shipclass their role in the tournament makes for less variation and thus less entertaining fights."

9/24/2009,"tcs as well as tds are scripted to perform one function (range or tracking) as well, which is working as intended. however, the differences between td and tc performances are disproportional. also, for affecting (range or tracking), falloff is part of range, so it must be included on both modules.do you know what else is targeted, and their counter is not? that's right, sensor damps/boosters.yes.signature radius will no longer be an issue. i don't know when (maybe dom?), but the archaic fail of radius comparison will be removed.edit:wtf does that have to do with anything?"
9/24/2009,"yes, these should have been fixed when tds got fixed, providing the same boost to optimal+falloff just like tds remove them.but its being looked at with the projectile buff they planned, i think."

9/24/2009,"the reason super carriers/moms aren't flown is because they cant be docked and 90% of eve isn't willing to sign away thier freedom for a kick a$$ ship.my proposal allow them to dock at a 0.0 outpost in a special way. with the use of a mothership docking array.steps to docking-when a mothership warps to a station it can check to see if there are any docking array spaces available.-if there are then the pilot is informed where the open array is and he/she must navigate their ship to that location be it with a warp off warp in or a little manual driving-once they are within 1000m of their docking array they can select begin docking procedures as an option. this would be similar to the dock button but it would take maybe 5 minutes for the ship to be navigated into its place. this would in effect be a cool down period to avoid abuse of docking games.-once the ship is docked and has been maneuvered into the docking array it is now invulnerable to attack, as it is protected by the docking array forcefield.-a pilot now has the option to exit the ship into their hanger. the ship now is docked up the pilot must give a docking code. this code must be entered before the ship can be re-entered.un-docking your mother ship.-as i said before the mom will be visible from outside the station and in a new in station service (mothership docking array) your mom will be listed.-to re-enter your mother ship you must open the service by clicking its button just like opening the insurance service. select your mothership, enter its boarding code and vuala, you are once more strapped to the side of the station in your shiny mothership. -now simply select undock and your ship will be released from the docking array and your free to go on your way.(if you want to let someone else fly it give them the code, they can select it from the station service and be on their way.)the docking array and the moms in it- moms in the docking array, are invulnerable... yes invulnerable. if its latched onto the side of the station its safe.-the docking array would have about the same health as a medium pos.-if the docking array is blown up, guess what. nothing is holding your mothership to the station, so it... drifts off into space where anyone with the proper skills can board it.-if the station is captured, then the ships are safe for 24 hours then they are no longer protected and may be boarded by the new inhabitants of the station.-let the array be upgradeable so at lvl1 2 moms can be docked at lvl2 5 moms can be docked and lvl3 10why can moms dock and my titan cant *titan pilot tears* (better then carebear)???? =_= because moms are 3-5km long, titans are 15-18km long... big f*ing difference.this is just my personal proposal to make super carrier/motherships more used in-game. hopefully it gets enough support that i will eventually fly a hel."
9/24/2009,wrongo. they are not flown because they are not worth it.
9/24/2009,"the short answer, nosorry, but no"
9/24/2009,nah pretty sure more important reason is that you need an alt for them. enough people with too much isk would get a mom instead of carrier if they could just dock them.
9/24/2009,"yep, remove the pain of trying to find out where you are exactly setting your clone."
9/24/2009,"but they are in local, when he not playing. so, he is in safe because noone can catch him. easy for cloaking when, no one can catch him. they just reserve the server capacity, when they not playing. yes, not need to make against afk cloakers, if the cloaked ship catchable. but now, everyone use the cloak on ceptor to capital.this is the second problem. would be logical, if just the cloak ships (recon,covops,sb,black ops) can just use it them.i knows the 0.0 players always cry for some eploits and easy lurking, but this is b*llsh*t. we need back the old times when those players who was afk minimum 30 minutes the server kicked them. play or go out, don't waste the costly server times."
9/24/2009,"wrong forum, dear. i think you wanted coad one tick up.there is no need to introduce fuel for cloaks when we already have the capacitor to build on.make cloaks draw a constant amount while operating with covops drawing considerably less to allow for extended cloaked operations.combine it with capacitors not recharging while cloaked (including gate cloak) and people have to decloak once in a while to recharge.no more cloaked ravens, capitals, afk'ers .. with new probes the small window is more than adequate for a hit provided you have a general location of victim/client/hostile.removing local wouldn't make sense as ccp has used the gates internal communications as a reason for local in their wh fiction .. where gates exists, local exists.would be nice if null-sec was delayed though. a three to four minute delay applicable to all parties with a sovereignty holder able to online a module to cut it in half for ""his side"" .. not safe, but safer."
9/24/2009,"to be honest, i like the complete immunity i get with on a covertops frigate in hostile space. i haven't seen a single good argument so far as to why that should change."

9/24/2009,not sure why it is not already so.

9/24/2009,"supported, hell yes.this."

9/24/2009,ccp is not going to revert the scanner back to the old one.
9/25/2009,"this is absurd! capital ships able to repair drones, the mere thought of it is heresy and those heretics who have supported this will be burned by the empress!that said, i support this however such an option should cost carrier pilots money or resources to repair said drones.that said, if resources are required to repair those drones a drone repair bay should be established giving carrier pilots another cool bay to store stolen resource stuff or not stolen...alternatively, if you like annoying us cool folks who drive capitals, just charge on a amount of repairs done so it matches station repair rates or higher but never lower. the staff you hire on your carrier aren't more compentant than those in the station."

9/25/2009,fix the scanner. i'm sure you can come up with a better idea than the current scanner.
9/25/2009,"really needs fixing asap. csm ignoring this urgend issue makes me sad.the high cpu load with the macros spamming scan for hostiles can easily avoided while keeping some delay for 360 scans (like one second) but removing it entirely again for 90, 60, 30, etc. narrow scans."
9/25/2009,"what the hell's wrong with you, csm?too afraid to walk back to ccp, and tell them that the answer wasn't good enough?if you have no idea how directional scanner works, then carry on your merry way."
9/25/2009,"im a ratter killer. the nano nerf almost broke me. it became much harder to solo and harder to catch ratters in belts. i adapted.this 2 second delay is something that cant be adapted to. i can no longer jump into a system and find that ravens belt in under 5 seconds. i used to pride myself on my ability to use the directional scanner. its a skill that is often overlooked in pvp. now scanning out a ratter is utterly frustrating and most of the time pointless.i could deal with a delay, a 1 second delay maybe? the problem bigger then that is that if you try to scan before the 2-seconds are complete, then the delay restarts. here is a scenario. i scan and see a raven, no poses, 4 belts equally distant. i narrow to 90 and attempt to wait 2 seconds then scan again. woops i clicked a fraction of a second before the delay ended, now i have to wait another full 2 seconds. by the time i find the ratter hes already warping off :(clicking the scan button and getting no results should not restart the delay. does clicking jump on a gate restart the session change timer? no! why not just make the scan take that much time to display results like is done with probes. then there would be some sort of feedback to the user that its ok to scan again. the current system is broken and needs fixing."
9/25/2009,then suggest changes from the crap that it is now!there has to be some way of keeping the lag down without us using the horrifically broken 'improved' scanner.

9/25/2009,"in their handling of the scanner issue, ccp has proven themselves to be minmatar -- but incompetant minmatar. (most likely ammatar, but that's besides the point.) when a minmatar engineer sees a leaky pipe, he quickly sizes up the problem and applies a suitable amount of duct-tape, sufficent to stop the leak. ccp, apparently, fixes the leak by shutting off the entire plumbing system.i'm grateful for the efforts ccp has made to reduce lag, and the results have been a generally improved playing experience. but in this case, the 'fix' makes an important aspect of the game almost entirely unplayable. coming up with a remedy for this should be a very high priority. i realize that there are plans for an eventual overhaul of the scanner system, but players need scanners to work passably well now, not in 6-8 months."

9/25/2009,"simply one word to this: no!csm's absolutely need term limits. without limits, all it would take is some major alliance (say goonswarm) to flex its voting muscle and keep the same do-nothing yahoos in the csm position indefinitely.suggesting no term limits smacks of corruption."
9/25/2009,"as many have said, no to this - can't support corruption and that is what your doing by increasing the term limit.presidents/prime ministers are restricted to limited terms because of the ability for corruption. furthermore parties are often altered over decades to prevent the corruption of one party. to support this would be to destroy the very foundation on which the csm was made, that is a council for the players of eve.furthermore it was ridiculously for someone such as yourself to bring this up. one only needs to read the words csm under author and the topic to know that something is wrong with this topic. csm should never have the ability to debate this topic or have any significant say over the matter. such decisions should be left to a third party, in our case ccp or if need be, the players. however since it is ccp's interest to get players ideas it should be left with them to make any real decision as to this.topic listed 2. states that incumbent's are observed on contributions. this has many forms and therefore would need clarification. furthermore contributions can be negative and promoted based on self-interest, this is not in the interests of ccp.so to clarify, no to supporting this. it's ccp's decision and not the players. allowing such an atrocity only opens up an avenue for corruption."
9/25/2009,"so thankfully, someone else in corp raised this to the attention of everyone. as since i'm not a big forum dweller, i never noticed it was being discussed.so quick reponse? oh dear frakking god no, its a god awful idea...democracy as laid down by the us administration has a 2 term limit, and when all is said and done, it works. i'll point at all the issues with 2 terms of dubya and say no more.in democractic countries where there are -not- term limits, we get situations like the thatcher years here in the uk.anyone with any sense will vote against this as being an all round terrible idea.em."

9/25/2009,"my vote is to keep the term limits. that way, we will keep cycling through new people, and perhaps we'll eventually come up with a set who actually serves as a voice for the players.kinda like the million monkey approach to writing literature, but in slow motion. right now we're still in the monkey stage, but eventually perhaps we'll end up with shakespeare."

9/25/2009,"i don't think you really know what is happening around you lino licker...in australia, sydney specifically there are gangs where the police ignore what they do as long as they don't become publicly involved. which is understandable, why stop people killing each other when both sides equally want to kill each other and you, the third party, have no opinion as to either side. should you then risk your life to stop them? no.on the the issue of wardecs, they play a pivotal role in eve online by hampering empire trading etc. corporations have to find other ways around this, hide their logistics alts etc - this adds to the spy market.thus, not supported."
9/25/2009,"wardecc mechanic is definitely flawed, but it has to be there. its what eve is... pvp in one form or another.the mechanic however is geared towards free piracy, a grief corp wardeccing industrials to get easy, low risk kills. if yuo were to look at all the wardeccs currently in game, i would expect well over 50% to be pvp corps wardeccing industrial corps to epeen their killboards.this is basically the problem, yes, you should be able to wardecc a corp, but there needs to be a way to make sure that war is valid in some way... not just a grief attack on a randomly chosen industrial corp.how to do this is a problem, but in my opinion, it needs to be looked at. wardeccs actually make people stop playing, and people may say 'ahh, goodbye and good riddance carebear' the simple fact is: too few players = goodbye eve online.so, what we need is valid ways to make wardeccs a mechanic that works, for the reason it was intended, not as a grief mechanic.one idea (may be bad but at least its an idea):have corporation security status, maybe a concord status, if youwardecc a corporation with a status thats high, your corp takes a security hit, and like normal security status, if your corp status goes below the limits for each system, you cant access that system...so grief corps would lose status fast and therefore have to target corps in lower and lower security.on top of this there should be some way of having a totally valid war, that is not subject to the above rules, ie maybe a corp member is killed in lowsec or by a suicide team, whatever, the agrieved corp could then wardecc the offending corp without any penalty...something like this anyway. some way to stop wardeccs as a simple grief mechanic."

9/25/2009,some players will do a log off to keep from getting killed that is just a factor. but a good hunting crew can normally find these guys and kill them anyway if they persist in playing.but if you limit this then should those that like to use the log off trap be penalized also? if you log off to surprise someone then shouldn't your ship not be able to lock a target for at least 5 minutes?oh and if your cable company just happens to interrupt your service because numb nuts down the street got caught pirating cable and they are having to fix his mess and you just happen to be in your dread getting ready to cyno and now you dont know what happened. so then is that fair?
9/25/2009,"stocastical processing can also be applied to rhetoric.lets do one on you omaraout of 3 factional posts available for pro caldari thread1 : attempt at missdirection by complaining about lack of damage bonuses , when 1 ship mentioned actually gets one and the other ships belong to group which dont get them for any faction.probability that post was attempt to derail thread 90%pro caldari thread2 : multiple attempts to ask for lots of work as proof, the task actuially being impossible as there are no unknown termsprobablility that post was attempt to derail thread 99%pro minmatar thread 1: agrees with op straight away without asking for a single shread of proofprobablity that post was attempt to derail thread 1%chances that omara otawan is a minimatars alt and has no interest whatsoever in this thread other than to see it buried because she does not like the data presented.(90/1 * 100/1 / 0.01) / ( 1 / 595,633 ( bc combat ranking ) ) = 536,069,700,000 to 1 againstseriously get a grip of yourself , the burden of proof you ask for when you see something you like is quite a lot less taxing.op > lets give trackin enhancers a boost to falloff so mini are better.omara otawan > oh.. yes please.would you care to tell me why i should provide more proof than i allready have ? when in other threads you are more than happy to agree without asking for a single shread of proof.and further more a stochastical analysis ( done by me ) of the results of what is allready a stochastical analysis ( by simulation ) of all ship parameters and unknowns ( whatever you may claim to the contrary ) would by its very nature introduce opinion and therefore bias into the data, thereby rendering it utterly useless.currently any bias shown in the data has not been entered by me.i'm sorry if your having a hard time excepting the facts.but dont go away just yet , cause when my 5 minute timer is up your gonna luuurv what i have for you next."

9/25/2009,"no, your method is still faulty. it has nothing to do with ewar ships, they just happen to be a very good example to show you what is wrong there. but i actually dont expect you to realize that anymore.but dont expect me to support your proposal (was there even any proposal in the op at all? dont think so...) either before you fixed that i have to say though, your attempt to dodge my point by trying to make a personal attack / questioning my motivation was mildly amusing, 3/10 for effort.edit: and just for your information, i am flying all races except gallente, so by your logic (being a minmatar alt, lol) i should agree with you simply for the fact i would bargain a boost for 2 of the 3 races i fly. i dont, however."
9/25/2009,"i think you know damn well that a stocastical analysis if done properly would take months if not years.dude that is so far past resaonable for a forum post its not even funny.what other motivation could you have ?you might be taken more seriosly if you post from your main, rather than an alt behind which you can hide you motivation."
9/25/2009,"i didnt ask for an extensive scientific study, i pointed out a very basic mistake in your formula for evaluating effectiveness. a very basic, very obvious mistake.a quick approach can be done in a few hours, to a few days if you wanna invest some time. it still can be done properly, avoiding aforementioned basic mistakes.if you would have any interest in being taken seriously, you'd think about how to fix your approach, yet all you do is stomping your feet and yelling ""but i'm right"".so yea, another troll thread obviously, but the title already suggested that anyway."
9/25/2009,"you were pointing out why only newbies with a small wallet would fly these and i was pointing out why i believe it can be a very good ship when properly utilised. my argument had nothing to do with your stats, i was pointing out for the price you get 10 blackbird's (insurable and well) you get 1 falcon. these perform better, no doubt about that, but this still makes the blackbird a very interesting option to fly as they are cheap and they are very nice ships.i say once again blackbird's when flown properly by a guy who knows his ship well is going to be a very valuable addition to a gang. yes it will be primaried however when your bb pilot knows his stuff he is not going to die due to this. anyone who knows how this handle this ship will volunteer no matter if they get primaried.it's not really a tin-foil hat area as much more of a sceptic's area. you put up a bunch of random numbers. the problem still is and remains that you can't rate ships and then conclude on this that they need to be fixed. as it stands now the sabre is now on top and the only reason that is is because they always end up on every killmail where a bubble has been deployed by the best dictor of eve (yes interdictors are unbalanced vs each other if you ask me).what you should however do is point out the ships or weapons that need fixing and why, this makes for a lot less negative responses as you gave them a problem and solution instead of what we now have is a global overview of ships being used and then being told that the entire race need a boost. if you want to propose fixes look at it from a one ship/one class level.i must say i have agreed with most people that your the information can not be used to support your argument what this has all turned into over the last 3 pages."
9/25/2009,i think its time we all let the poor man suffer in his delusion on his own.if you keep feeding him he's going to continue to bang his head on the wall of irrationality.so please... ignore him.it's obvious he's full of ####... so stop feeding the troll.
9/25/2009,"wrong.battleclinics algorithm favors solo/smallscale pvp (less than 5 people) ... it's possible to win a fleetbattle with 100 bs kills to no losses and all you get is overall 1 point.in other words - if all your kill are solokills and all your losses are against a blob your statistic will be favorable for you. you could lose 10 ships to a blob (because your piloting skills suck/the setup isn't suitable for your playstyle/this situation) and you'll still come out on top because you killed one lone target of the same size or bigger.this means - bc bias to solo pvp means - unless you do *a lot* of solo-pvp you won't be part of the top100.no. i know many excellent pvpers that heavily favor so called lolpvpships (like: exequeror, osprey, celestis, atron) because it's eve on hard. that's also the reason why the exequeror high in your list - because some players in your list enjoy eve on hard-mode. and their excellence can be seen in making ships work *despite* the general ship performance.wrong. pvp is situational. there's no ""bad"" ship per se (or atleast they are only a few) - but ships utilized in a unsuitable situation will perform sub-par if not completly terribad. statistics *can* be use to answer questions, but before you *have* to know the correct question. your question was not ""how good perform ships in pvp"", but ""what ships are prefered by the top95 in the bc-ranking"".when you consider how battleclinic processes the data you'll realize that the top-players are solo/small-scale pvpers. even without your analysis we could have told you that amarr/caldari aren't suited that much for solo-pvp, but more for bigger gangs."
9/25/2009,"err no... the case of your exeqror it gets in your rating mostly because of its successful usage by one corp (genos), which is a bit over represented in your top 95 due to bc peculiar scoring system.and they didn't use it because they think it's good... they did it for the lulz, and used it to farm cva pets, which aren't exactly known to be bright...."
9/25/2009,"oh this is just stupid. you are stupid. you are stupid for wasting your time on this, your statistical methodology is stupid, your list is prima facie stupid and you are stupid for taking your nonsense stats at face value and i am stupid for replying to this stupid thread.the ordering is still nonsense.kronos second best? nonsense.exequeror fifth? nonsense.incursus and atron above rifter? nonsense.jaguar, wolf and vigil good? nonsense.drake below cyclone? nonsense.rokh fifth worst? nonsense.ishkur seventh worst? nonsense.cerberus second worst hac? nonsense.griffin worst frigate? nonsense.zealot non-existent? nonsense."
9/25/2009,"this is the part where i became convinced you were just blowing smoke up our collective asses. if you're not willing to invest the time to do the statistical analysis properly, your numbers aren't worth the electrons it takes to render them on my screen.a lot of us are asking exactly the same question about you. especially at this point."
9/25/2009,"very typical of the hatred bubbling away in this thread.call me stupid and the stats stupid as many times as you like.not one of the 6 or 7 people posting and reposting again and again in this thread they consider stupid can offer 1 single reason why the data would show a strong favouritesm towards gallente and minimater boats for pvp.incursus and atron above rifter? nonsense.incursus is tier 5 frig scored against other tier 5 frigsatron is tier ii frig scored against tier ii frigsjaguar, wolf and vigil good? nonsense.etc, etc.drake below cyclone? nonsense.etc. etc.rokh fifth worst? nonsense.erm top 50 ships posted in this postishkur seventh worst? nonsense.^^ read abovecerberus second worst hac? nonsense.yeah cerb scores badly because its in the same group as the vaga.vaga gets a huge score.cerb may be a good ship , but its lightyears behind the vaga.griffin worst frigate? nonsense.erm top 50 ships posted in this postzealot non-existent? nonsense.[/erm top 50 ships posted in this post"
9/25/2009,"because your assertion is wrong. the sample isn't useful if you want to consider all forms of pvp. by taking the top 100 players in bcs listing you already have chosen a sample that favors small scale/solo pvp. the strength of gallente & minmatar is solo/small scale pvp (or should i say: if you want to do solo-pvp your best choice is likely gallente or minmtar) .. but this isn't disputed by anyone ... and in this regard the chosen data supports this statement.if you want to talk about the perfomance of ships in bigger fleets, the top 100 of bc are not a useful sample.pvp = solo-pvp + smallscale pvp + fleet pvp (the difference of the later two isn't as pronounced as some might wish)"
9/25/2009,"a valid concern.go check the km's of the top players , there is plenty of fleet action in there.further the sample size for bs & bc is huge, these are not great solo / small gang roam ships. theres plenty of data in there for fleet action.small gang ships ( inti's , hacs , etc ) etc show favourtism towards mini>galfleet ships ( bs and bc ) show favoritsim amarr>gal>mini>caldari iirc."
9/25/2009,"except even if they do fleet stuff, the points that put them high up the charts are from their solo action. the one good way to climb up on bc is to pop expensive stuff in cheap stuff. if you don't mind dying a lot just fit t1 frigs for anti-interceptor work and go to 0.0 entry points. you'll be able to farm lots of nub inty pilot seeing you as food (you'll be ganked a lot too, but guess what, you don't lose many points for losing a t1 frig, especially to superiors ships). that's why your stats are very skewed toward a very small subset of pilots not representative of the general pvp scene, and yes it will be skewed toward gallente/minmatar. it doesn't mean they won't hop in a holy golden dong when serious business calls."
9/25/2009,"as empirical evidence of your theory please explain to us, the assembly hall voters, what is about the exequror that makes it the best t1 cruiser for pvp use? how would you fit it? how would you fly it? what strategies would you use?what makes it so over-powered?inquiring minds would like to know....."
9/25/2009,"the data shows that the exequror is the best cruiser in its tier , not best cruiser overall. its score is based on its effectiveness kill/losses as a percentage and its popularity within its own tier.if it scores higher than other ( better ) cruisers its because it is better within its own group than the higher tier cruisers are within there respective groups.so with respect if i may modify your question to what make the exequor the best tier i cruiser or is it tier ii ? my answer would be.i dont have the faintest idea. never flown one , dont even know what they look like tbh."
9/25/2009,"had a quick look at it on the item database.it gets very nice bonuses to remote armor reps.its compared in its clasee against shipsamarr: augura ( remote energy transfer ).caldari: osprey ( remote shield transfer ).minmatar: sythe ( remote tracking link ).this is pure speculation , but i think remote armour rep is just the best support mod to bring along for spider tanked gangs."
9/25/2009,"there is just one slight problem, logistics usually don't get on killmails."
9/25/2009,"point , drones , weapons/rr split on top row.all quite capable of being on km's"
9/25/2009,"but equally true of all the other tier 1 cruisers. so what is it about the exequror that your system of testing proves?also, 3 of the 4 tier 1 cruisers are mining platforms, osprey and scythe getting direct laser bonus's, exequror gets larger drones and a larger cargohold. how are the non-pvp applications of these ships accounted for in your testing that would warrant a boost to caldari and amarr?"
9/25/2009,"yeah , you just explained why the gallente tier i logistics is better at pvp.more cap charges too, i missed that , like i say i dont fly them.the data is based on kill/losses over 1 year for 95 of the best players in eve.there are no numbers for the number of roids munched sorry.mining/ratting/missioning/plexing/wormholing/pos refueling/transporting and spacerobatics are all beyond the scope of this study.concerned here about pvp balance , someone else can do pve, good luck too them with this crowd :)"
9/25/2009,"point - your too close for a logidrones - why are you not using them for logistics as wellweapons - km *****, free up that space for logistics don't go splitting your efficiencythe real reason those mails float up is because they can easily be used as bait."
9/25/2009,you need to go look up what a spider tank is.who said anything about them being used as pure logistics ?if your gonna do that your gonna use a logistics ship.
9/25/2009,"i know what a spider tank is don't try to lecture me, are you planning on spider tanking a few logi cruisers with almost zero dps and no realistic rr tank.you started about logistics when you summed up the bonuses of the logistical side pointing out why you think they are good.this about the specific t1 logi cruisers not their t2 cousins."
9/25/2009,"so it's your contention that the top 95 people who provide data to battleclinic are the top 95 pvp'ers in all of eve online? how did you test this contention to prove it correct?your title quite clearly calls for a ""boost caldari + boost amarr"". how can you call for a boost to 2 entire races of ships based soley on pvp and not on any mining/ratting/missioning/plexing/wormholing/pos refueling/transporting and space[ae]robatics?so you do admit then that this study is of [very] limited scope."
9/25/2009,"spider tank there you go , thats what i'm talking about before you jump to any more conslusions.the article focuses on bs , but it can equally be done in cruisers.i'm not personally planning any t1 spider tanked cruiser roams , but if i were out of all the t1 logi ships i take the exequoror as its armor rep bonus is far more valuable than the bonii offered by the other t1 logi.of course it would also be handy to get the new boy in the corp to fly a armor tanked bb to provide some ewar support.who knows , with 4 or 5 exe's on the field he might have a 50/50 chance of making it back to base in 1 piece ;)"
9/25/2009,ignoring your argumentative first point.corrected the title of the op. thansk for pointing that out.yes. pvp data only = of use in investegating pvp balance only.
9/25/2009,"from your op, so how am i being argumentative? how do you know that the top 95 pvp'ers in eve are the very same top 95 contributors to battleclinic on which your entire dataset is based?"
9/25/2009,"oh thank you for that link i really didn't know that! you have just opened a new world for me... how realistic do you assume it is that 5 t1 cruisers with a rr tank are going to even be deployed. i will tell you it's none. they can not provide enough dps with a rr tank setup to really kill anything which can't escape, which is the strength of the rr bs gang. make the ships passive tanked and repping each other so the tanks can't break and provide loads of dps.a very good example are the dominixes they make for class rr bs gang ships."
9/25/2009,"yeah the op needs cleaning up and clarifying , it was a bit of a quick and dirty.it was gonna be a sample size of 100 players.it turned out to be 95 because 2 of the entrys on the leader board were npc entities and 3 players were no longer active and had no or virtually no known ship data.so thats why its 95.the point in using the data was to get the combat records of 100 very good pvp'rs to look at what ships they flew and how well they flew them.who are the best 95 players in eve ? the largest public non partisan dbase available is bc , and it says these people are , who am i to disagree with that ?"
9/25/2009,"actually, it's not none. god forgive me for coming anywhere close to agreeing with dav varan in this thread but if you dl and watch part 2 of garmons movie here. you'll see towards the end they get drunk and decide to take 7 rr exequror's out into cva space where the locals do a really nice job of sticking their heads on the block.now, they are doing this purely for sh**s and giggles but garmon and friends are very good and make what is a mining/hauler cross breed a pvp ship ( against fairly useless opposition). this one special and, i believe, unique evening of drunken lulz completely skews the dataset making the exequror look better than it is. that's why i was asking van davan what he knows about this ship, it's use and if knows anything about this incident which invalidates all the data his test is based on (and the answer is 'no' to all three)."
9/25/2009,"(a) you're obviously lacking a clue if you lose bbs so often.(b) the whole methodology is flawed.let's take your data sample:(a) data collected mostly from pilots who are more inclined to solo/small gang? check. (a gang on gang fight yields you maybe 6-7 points for two 10-15 man gangs bashing each other; soloing a merlin in a thrasher gives you ten. there's no way to get to the top w/out doing a lot of solo/small gang.)(b) bc top 100 is chosen using a data set older then one year, when balance was different.(c) effectiveness a worthless measure for gang situations? check. flying the most worthless ship in a gang which dies will result in you being on most mails, even if you just ninjaed on it with 0 damage. bonus points if you got away.(d) popularity a worthless measure of ship performance? check. couple with the fact that most on the top 100 will solo / very small gang more then they will fly in large gangs (since it's the only way to actually get there) and therefore fly ships which are better for this type of combat more often?your data set would be more believeable if it encompassed all players (includes failfits - yes, but so does your data set - only failfits killed at the hands of the bc top 100). if that is too hard, randomly chosen, eg. 100.000-1.000.000 killmails would do.your analysis of the data set would yield better results with:(1) separate list of all t1 frigates in general, since there is no difference in usage of a rifter and a incursus - they're directly comparable ships even being of a different tier, ditto vexor/thorax, ditto all bs, ditto bcs, etcetera.- separate list of all afs- separate list of all interceptors- separate list of all t1 cruisers- separate list of all bcs...this removes the sort of results where 'omg, vigil is better then any hac'. it's probably 6-7th when it comes to t1 frigates, and rifter is almost certainly 1st. comparing a chimera to a rifter on a global scale is rather pointless.also, it cuts off the completely misleading bits, like the munnin close to a vagabond (why on earth would you divide hacs into two cathegories?), and so on, and enables a reasonable analysis by shiptype.(2) a saner measure of ship performance being:kd_efficiency = sum(engagement_kills)/sum(engagement_losses)+sum(engagement_kills) per every engagement.afaik most kbs have the capability to give you a look at the entire fight when you look at killboards. not sure if bc does. results returned are the same for solo fights but do not favour ships which are utterly worthless to primary. better measure of what something brings to a gang.if you must have popularity, then it needs to be included as a separate list."
9/25/2009,great ideas

9/25/2009,support.
9/25/2009,"many things on the eve-online.com website are ""mirrored"" through eveonline.com.such as the forums. however, one thing i noticed that isn't is the api.at my workplace, eve-online.com is blocked by the trend micro client/server security agent and categorized under ""games"", but eveonline.com is not and is free to access. which is how i'm even posting this at work at this very moment.this means evemon and eft cannot access the api.i am requesting that www.eveonline.com be assigned to the api as well so that it may give some people another option to gaining access to it."
9/25/2009,did you ever consider it is blocked on purpose and circumventing the company firewall might get you fired?do you like your job?
9/25/2009,eve online is a game.... i seriously doubt ccp is going to change something up just for something as simple as a firewall.
9/25/2009,"i'm not circumventing it. they left it open. not my fault.so going to a blog site that has yet to be classified as social networking even though other similar sites are blocked is circumventing the firewall? no.it's not my problem that there happens to be two addresses to the same website.furthermore, my company has no direct control over which sites get blocked, only which categories we can and cannot view. trend micro systems is in charge of the categorization of an individual website and eveonline.com has yet to be classified which means it's fair game to access.lastly, this has nothing to do with my job, this has to do with me requesting ccp to add api access through eveonline.com, just like they do with several other of their ""services""."
9/25/2009,let's wait until your boss finds out.
9/25/2009,"my boss won't. they don't monitor traffic. as i said, they have no direct control over the blocking of specific sites so they are not watching which sites we go to. we are allowed to use the internet, they are just trying to limit the types of sites we can go on.in all actuality, she probably turned on ""games"" so we couldn't play flash-based games because they are definitely against that. they've seen us doing that and asked us to stop. which, we did when we were asked to, way before the filter was implemented. it just so happens websites like eve-online.com refer to a game so it gets categorized under ""games"". their intention is not to stop us from looking at websites at all because the handbook says we are allowed to."
9/25/2009,"everyone sees the isk spammers flying around space. most people either block or ignore them, from my understanding, because that's simpler than reporting them.i propose changing the ui to make it easier to report characters for spamming isk, among other things.what i propose is adding a ""report"" option to the right click function when right clicking on the name of a speaker in chat or the speakers message. the ""report"" option would expand out into a few other options which would include ""isk spammers"" ""harassment"" and ""other rules violation"", etc, etc. once an option is selected, the create petition window pops open with the selected characters name already input and verified, and the associated message that was clicked is filled in as the petition text. the petition title is also filled in as an appropriate generic title for the category selected. to report an isk spammer, all one would have to do is right click the spam, highlight ""report"" click ""isk spam"" when it pops out a second later, make sure the right character and message is auto-entered into the window that pops up, and click ""create petition"". three mouse clicks to report an isk spammer.it would also help if this was enabled in the mail system as well, for when isk spammers hit your eve-mail box.to combat abuse, add text to the top of the create petition window opened by these options indicating that abuse of the reporting system would result in sanctions against your characters/accounts, and if and when such abuse does happen, have the gm's hand out escalating punishment such as one day bans, one week bans, one month bans, and so on, up to a permanent ban.also, make any character that is reported under this petition added to a temporary block list that flushes itself either every 30 minutes or so, or isn't saved at all so it empties upon logging outby taking the process of reporting isk spammers down to only a few clicks of the mouse, the general apathy of the population can be combated, and more people will be inclined to report these hacking, macroing, isk spamming bastards rather than just ignoring them."

9/25/2009,"/signedwow has the same feature and i loved it back when i played.there was no effort involved in simply right-clicking the person.it made you *want* to report the offender.if ccp really cares about getting rid of isk spammers, they would implement this.incidentally, i wonder if they really do care since they *haven't* implemented it."
9/25/2009,"you know it's weird when it takes less time to get a response from gm about an isk seller than it does to file the petition in the first place.so i'm supporting this, on the condition that the gms come down hard on abusers, even... no, *especially*... on the larger scale where entire alliances would mass-report their enemies on the assumption that they could get away with it because ""there's too many of us for them to ban everyone over it""./ben"
9/25/2009,"carebear> what, you mean that i won't be able to afk mine whilst at work, and i'll have to stop leading a solitary hermit-like existence in an inherently social game in order to organise a proper mining op with gate scouts?!? nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!supporting making (low/null)sec local like w-space local. ccp had planned to do this anyway, and they backtracked, presumably because like all other crazy people the taste of carebear tears is something other than sweet nectar to them. looking at the scanner thread though (50+ pages and thousands of supports and no meaningful response from the csm other than to use probes... wtf) i have a horrible suspicion that only the interests of carebears are represented atm - which given the certainty (i hope) that the csm are not all carebears, makes me a sad panda in any case, the csm should be telling ccp to get of their bums and implement a feature they were talking about a year ago."
9/25/2009,"not supported, why?in anticipation of dominion, major alliances are already retreating from their space to conserve costs. costs?if you read the dev blogs one of the differences in the new expansion should be the introduction of a new sov ownership system, one in which you the player pay for all the benefits associated with a system. that includes the stargates that other players use! this means that the more stargates, the more you pay but not only that, resources will increase in systems where you pay for additional extras!what's this mean? massively reduce your empire to say 30-50 people per system (including alts etc, time zones of the players) where as most of space currently is only populated by either; no one but with moon mining, 3-5 people with moon mining or the exception of 20-50 people in the system. removing local from 0.0 is simply not worth looking at until after this new expansion...period."
9/25/2009,"no, local channel should stay as it is now."
9/25/2009,"well the way i see it is as follows.removing local would not be the threat a lot of pilots have stated in this thread.what would it really do if local was gone ?1: we'd have to use the ships onboard scanner. (it's not as nerfed as some of you make out)2: we'd have to use scouts.3: covert op ships are finaly truly covert.4: system wide scanning with probes would become the norm.5: fleets/squads would have to improve teamwork and communications.6: security patrols would be a must.7: no more smack talk.i really don't see what the problem would be, shouldn't all fleets/squads be doing 1,2,4,5 & 6 anyway ? oh yea, i forgot to take into account the lazy pilots who want it all handed to them on a plate.change is a good thing, specialy if it improves gameplay like i believe removing local would.supported."
9/25/2009,"yeah nothing like entering a system, seeing 30 ships on scan, and locating them all one by one empty at a pos... hugely benefiting pirates here..."
9/25/2009,"i wouldn't give two darns about the glaringly obvious scammers if it were not for their incessant spam. when in amarr/jita/rens i simply close local to not be bothered...what i *would* like is a r-click player and select 'spam'. this immediately blocks the user to you as long as you're in that system and logged in, but does not add them to your 'buddy list' as blocked permanently.if enough people select 'spam' on a given character in a given period of time they get gagged for a period of time (15m to an hour). if this gag occurs more than a set number of times in, say, a few hours they are gagged for a couple of days. if they keep getting hour/days long gags they're flagged for review and can possibly be banned entirely."
9/25/2009,"whilst the nerd rage still flows, we need a way to instigate a special election so that we can kick out the csm before their term is up if they do something monumentally idiotic.proposala petition is raised here calling for a special election. if 5% or more of the votes cast in the election support this (1500 people based on the last election) then an official referendum vote is triggered to end the term early. if it passes the csm is dissolved and elections start anew.protectionsto stop hilarious griefing of the system, all referendum votes remain secret.if a referendum vote fails no referendum proposal may be tabled <14 days afterward.vote takes place the first saturday >=7 days after the recall proposal gets enough support.optionsthis could be changed to an individual candidate recall, but i fear that it's harder to stop abuse. in any case, as long as the csm are all happy that they've done enough, they should have ntohing to fear from a global recall vote anyway."
9/25/2009,"nope.just get rid of the csm.how many more barriers between players and ""pseudo-staff"" do we need?"
9/25/2009,"i disagree. i think the csm is inherently a good thing, but it's in danger of becoming irrelevant if it doesn't actually represent us plebs, and in any case it doesn't obviate the need to make the members directly accountable.one might argue that having 3 from the worker caste, 3 from the warrior caste and 3 from the monster raving loony caste might be a better model, but that's a seperate issue.oh and support because i am that vain."
9/25/2009,what do you think the odds are of a csm member picking this up :v
9/25/2009,"given the inanity of the current csm and the current power block voting structure of the elections anyway - i'd say it's pretty good, because it won't matter (unless you also ban recalled csms from reelection regardless of whether they've hit their term limit or not)."
9/25/2009,"the odds are pretty damn low - seeing as how a 57 page thread gets ignored (concerning real pvp events), while puffy zomg! i need more free trips to iceland, paid by my lol player-base's dime pop up, when they need to.there's more than one angry player here."
9/25/2009,"what i dont get is why you guys have such a problem with the csm in the first place. it's not like we're pushing to make the game worse, and we already do get kicked out by ccp when we do something monumentally idiotic. so why so much of this impotent internet rage?also lol @ the potential for all the goons to kick out anybody they want. actually that would be kind of funny."
9/25/2009,"ccp told us directly the scanner wont get reset to the way it used to be. what else do you want us to do? force ccp's hand?you're angry, and you're ignorant. now you know better."
9/25/2009,because their candidate did not win and you do not support their ideological viewpoints.
9/25/2009,"just quotin' for the majority... oh... i dunno...maybe trying to at least pretend to represent the players you were voted to represent?!i'd love to discuss this more, but you have much more important topics in mind.simple, basic topics such as oh... pvp can just take a backseat, i 'spose..."
9/25/2009,check out the topic i am raising for this meeting:
9/25/2009,...and?
9/25/2009,and what~
9/25/2009,so i guess you know how to use the quote button.
9/25/2009,please refrain from quoting other people with no additional discussion worthy content.
9/25/2009,micia.... the day you start to realize ccp is in charge and not the csm... is the day you stop being a stupid idiot.the csm can bring any and all proposals to the table... but if ccp says no... the answer is no.blaming the csm for a decision made by ccp is nothing short of... stupidity.take it like a man.... or gb2wow please.oh and stop trolling.as to the op...i like... but it wont work.... the mechanic would need to be defined to a bit more refinement...
9/25/2009,"i'm a big fan of recall elections in real-life politics, but i'm going to have to oppose this proposal. the biggest difference is that my mp is a single representative - my riding is represented by one guy. he has to get a plurality to win his seat, and if that plurality shifts, then he can justly be replaced as our representative. the csm uses a different electoral system, and it's one where the rationale for recall is far less clear-cut. consider a representative who is clearly there to represent some large, but still distinctly minority, group. the clearest example of this on the current csm would probably be zastrow j - i don't think he has much of a non-goon voter base, whereas the other alliance reps tend to have more spillover. zastrow isn't there to represent me or you, he's there to represent goons. how can he justly be recalled by anyone who isn't a goon? this all boils down to what the council is, really. it's not a government, it's an advisory board. the electoral system is specifically designed to create broad representation of diverse play styles - yes, a lot of people hated lark, or ankh, or jade, but they were legitimate representatives of large groups of players. ccp doesn't need to know that each of them has a whole bunch of haters, because i'm sure that they're already aware. they want to know what evil pirates, or idiot carebears, or wacky tl;drmancers think needs to be done with the game, so that they can ensure that they don't **** off large swathes of their player base, or ignore concerns that only affect one group. even if most players hate a given rep, it really doesn't matter - they're one voice of nine, and they're not there to be liked by everyone. they're there to speak for their people, and as such you shouldn't be able to recall them if you're not one of their supporters. also, a more practical concern. csm terms are six months long. just how long do you think it takes to run a recall petition and election? not supported."
9/25/2009,this... plus my statement about ccp being in the charge.the csm is an attempt at representing the players... but not a direct intervention to change game mechanics.
9/25/2009,"i've been wondering this too and i think it directly ties to the lack of transparency going on with the csms. we also rarely, if ever, see or hear any results that directly came with having a csm body that improved the game.sometimes you guys will put out a list of agendas you intend to bring up with ccp, but that's usually the last we ever hear about it. plus it's often the same list of agendas from the last csms and the csms before them."
9/25/2009,"the list of issues we bring up are released to the public.and the patch notes are also released to the public.quite a few csm issues were put into the game or else made moot by other overhauls so you need to do a bit better research before you start crying about lack of transparency. maybe we didnt connect the dots for you, but what we accomplished remains there."
9/25/2009,"i see much wisdom in your words, i do./signed"
9/25/2009,"good point well made, but at the same time i'd counter with this - an mp is elected to represent his whole constituancy - even, and one could argue especially, those that did not vote for them. there's a point about voter participation here too with regards the ability of alliance power blocs to guarantee a seat at the table, but that diverts somewhat from the central issue, which is that if they are not properly representing us, then they're not doing their jobs. as individual members you can't get away from the point you made this is true, but this is why i explicitly framed the proposal in terms of the whole csm. collectively they are here for us. in terms of timing, i'd be happy for there to be longer limits if that was what was required, but i see no reason why start to finish the whole recall / re-election couldn't be completed within a month.incidentally most of your concerns (the goon problem et al.) are fixed by increasing voter participation, and in the absence of party political broadcasts before the 9 o'clock news letting more people know what the candidates stood for before the election, giving people a chance to recall once the candidates are in place would give people the feeling that they can make a difference in this process - even if all we're doing is electing an advisory board. make the average joe in his pod feel like he's part of this, and he'll be more likely to take an interest. thus do we get something that actually works as opposed to infantile dribblings we're getting at the moment."
9/25/2009,neither jade or that stupid dutch chick are on so i really dont see the need for this
9/25/2009,"your proposed recall mechanic would be abused to hell and back. there would be a motion to dissolve the csm every fourteen days just for the fun of it.from the replies to this thread, i gather that you are angry that the csm was unable to get the scanner cooldown removed. i fail to see why this is angering you - the csm delegates do not have any actual control over what the developers do. the csm opened an issue about it. i don't understand what else you expect them to do?i do not see where the csm is failing in their role?"
9/25/2009,"anyone can propose any motion, but if it doesn't get the thousands of supports then it's not happening, so no abuse.as to the issue you refer to, you're late to the party. tl;dr version is as followsfederated union of scouts in eve> augh! 2 secs nerf!!! do not want!!ccp> tough. lag is bad.csm> ccp say no. use probes.fuse> srsly?!?csm> yes. no rollback!fuse> ok, here's options a,b,c,d... which don't rollback.csm> ccp said no rollback. we're talking about making the camera more like wowfuse> no way!csm> way! now bugger off!me> no. here's whycsm> cry morefuse> bad csm!ccp> *delete posts* *delete more posts* thread cleaned of off topic material. bad forum *****s!csm> *adds scanner issue to agenda*"
9/25/2009,"every member of the csm could be my own personal love slave and i'd still want this. nerd rage may have inspired the initial post but at its heart, the csm works best by getting more than 10% of the population to vote, and part of the way you get to do that is by empowering the voters. at the risk of repeating myself unnecessarily (the point is important so i'm going to do it anyway) the voting population aren't broadly aware of the manifestos / platforms on which csm candidates stand, and in lieu of some kind of organised dissemination of said material, the people will remain passive in gaining said knowledge. by giving them the option, when there's misconduct, or incompetance or downright neglect on the part of the csm, to remove the members on a vote of no confidence, everyone feels more a part of the whole thing."
9/25/2009,"yes, i do realise that ultimately ccp makes the decisions.i am not blaming the csm for ccp's decisions.i am angry that the csm has simply accepted ccp's response, and (despite the huge amount of support) has refused to go back to ccp to actually fight for it!talk about rolling over like a beaten dog.i'm not trolling. i'm simply passionate about this."
9/25/2009,"what purpose would ``fighting for it'' serve, exactly? they changed it because they decided scanner spam was hurting system performance. they can look at the ``support'' counter on the scan time thread just as well as you or i can, and despite it, they are not reverting the change. any further petitions to do so would be a waste of time. however, if what foolish bob said is true...then i would indeed be disturbed. however, i haven't kept up with the threadnaught, so i don't know what exactly was said. if 1,264 people agree that the cooldown timer is unacceptable and some have proposed alternatives but been ignored by the csm, then that would indeed be a problem."
9/25/2009,"what happens to those modules that required sov levels. are these mods going to be instantly anchorable as the system gains sov? or, will it still be required to hold sov for a set number of days before these can be anchored.-instantly anchor able would allow alliances to erect a bridge network through hostile territory very fast and protect it from capital siege attacks. this would speed up sov battles allowing hostiles to bring more ships to bear faster and deeper into hostile space then before.-on the down side it would make the removal of such a network necessary for a defending alliance and making it easy for the attacking alliance to steam roll through as the defending alliance spent time and assets both trying to defend space and remove the hostile bridge network.ideas for sov changes to control towersthere should be some benefits and drawbacks the new sov system has to the control towers. why? hostiles looking to remove sov will undoubtedly anchor control towers to use as rally points and safe spots during a siege. as soon as that happens it is not only a sov battle but a pos battle as well with does nothing but add more complexity to the new system that it was suppose to avoid or reduce. my idea would be to nerf the hostile control towers so they are less likely to be used, and when they are they are reasonably nerfed to a point that they can be taken down easier and require less of a capital blob to do.some random ideas for nerfing hostile control towers in a sov system: (some combination of the following to give a advantage of the sov holders to remove hostile control towers).-inability to enter reinforced mode-reduction in hit points-reducing the fittings (cpu and power grid)-increasing fuel costs 100%-reduction or removal of all resistances (can be overcome by anchoring hardeners but then reduces the number of defenses that can be anchored slightly)-removal or reduction of passive recharging of shieldsa benefit or bonus to the attackers as soon as the took sov is.. those nerfs then are switched to the original sov holders and they would now have an easier time removing the hostile towers from the system."
9/25/2009,"not supported because if you remove the dumpsters, people will simply dump their trash in the street."
9/25/2009,"it's not necessary to remove caod altogether when all they need to do is enforce the existing rules of the forum, starting with the one about caod supposedly being in-character./ben"
9/25/2009,"it's not a good idea to ban caod as it would simply move to another forum. while it would get rid of the problem why shouldn't we have all eve posts here?proactive and encouraging moderation is needed imho.there are small corps that should have a voice, this needs to be balanced with the corps that have thousands of voices. hard to do if you apply specific rulesets that tend to exclude small corps because of a size limit...spam alliances do exist to counteract this measure and are laughing. small corps are upset because they can't take part.i'd take a look at how shc do regional/conflict threads. also, make caod a no warning ban area. one wrong move, slap. apply to all characters on an account."
9/25/2009,if the ops idea is implemented what exactly would be the purpose of a drone bay?
9/25/2009,long ago when eve was still new and for a few years after you could do just this then ccp removed it so guess what their not about to reverse that decision
9/25/2009,yup. e.g. a ship with a 5m^2 drone bay could keep pumping out scout drones forever.bad idea.
9/25/2009,"i'm going to get flamed so bad for this i know it. i propose to not allow any character in this game to sell anything, unless they are in a player corp. this way you can hold those players who like to under sell you accountable for their actions. just so that we're clear on this, one way to get around those who have alts who mission, but in a npc corp to avoid war decs, can still trade it to a character who is in a corp, and sell it that way. the market keeps getting flooded by idiots who want to make the price of your items less because they don't care about what they have."
9/25/2009,"actually, most pure trading characters will never undock from jita 4-4, so what would being able to wardec them change apart from wasting your isk?as you already pointed out the player that acquires the stuff can just trade it over in station, think npc-corp hauler alt that does all the moving..."
9/25/2009,pretty much this!
9/25/2009,and so you think that the only way to make isk for new characters should be running missions?when you have low skills mining is a decent way to make isk.and all the people that has dropped out of a player corp to recover isk to pvp should only run missions?
9/25/2009,no. just no.
9/25/2009,"god, let it rain brains.*facepalms*not supported."
9/25/2009,"what you're saying is that there should be no npc corps.so you're failing at trading pvp -- not a reason to rewrite the rules. if they're selling way below your production cost, have you considered buying up their stock and reselling at a profit?don't take it personally, it's just that this is a terrible idea."
9/25/2009,"sure, all stations should kick pilots out 100 km from the station -- in one of several random directions.if the undocking pilots aren't in docking range, than the station campers shouldn't be either.also, pilots should be able to see what's outside the station before they un-dock (or have the option to change their minds after they see what's out there).however, i think this is not the primary cause of docking games, it is the mechanic that allows docking games."
9/25/2009,wow you really are out of touch are you not? 5 weeks for a new player to be pvping in a bs. i think you have got new players mixed up with alts.
9/25/2009,"the horse is dead. for the love of god, stop beating it."
9/25/2009,"i don't see a problem with the rig patch. they simply balanced the build cost for rigs across ship classes. now the question ""do i rig this ship or not"" uses the same rig cost vs hull cost parameters that it did before for battleships. now, either, fitting rigs to battleships was a 'no brainer' before the patch, or it wasn't. if it wasn't, then it's similarly not a 'no brainer' for smaller ships. also, there are differences in cost among rigs of the same ship class. so you might choose to go with an expensive cdf or go with cheaper resist rigs."
9/25/2009,"fixed. qq some more.there is absolutely nothing wrong with ccp making a move like this.a good majority of modules have various sizes to fit various ships. it doesn't make sense that a rig that can fit on a frigate can also fit on a battleship. and the fact they all give the same returns should mean nothing because smaller ships have less to start with anyway.15% of 100pg is 15 added pg. oh noes, that frigate gained so much more pg. as if it makes such a huge difference. it's not like frigates getting rigs means they can kill bs's now.this option does add choice: choice to people who don't have all the money in eve at their beck and call."
9/25/2009,"think i'm up to 75,000 to 80,000 mouse clicks with blueprint locking system.more clicks then lines of code :-p"
9/25/2009,"there's already been a couple threads on allowing corps to switch to role-locking for bpos. i support the principle, but i prefer the other mechanism to this one."
9/25/2009,"ability for an fc to label primary and secondary targets ingame, hell yes.the rest... not supported."
9/25/2009,"broadcasts (they work), tagging (doesn't really work, you only pick tags if you are on grid at the moment of tagging)."
9/25/2009,"have a better steam for the finals... it was fine for maybe 20 min, then i couldn't watch it because they were 1 second bits of footage every 5+ seconds...i think i've detected a time flux."
9/25/2009,"this, really. there was absolutely no point in fielding a t1 combat cruiser instead of a tier1 battlecruiser.about the ecm ships, imo they should be limited in a similar way as logistics, i.e. only one ecm specialized ship, with the exception of ecm frigates being allowed to use two if you dont field a ecm cruiser etc."
9/25/2009,"i say give each team 10 ship classes to use like in the olden days this may reduce imagination but seriously no more logi ship setups or mass medium sized dps ships.give the gladiators the weapons you want then let them fight with skill and tactics screw free will it's for entertainment and glory.also no implant, no best named only tech 1 or tech 2 keep it simple"
9/25/2009,"not sure why this is in ah, but ok let's critique at 7 here.i am not a fan of reintroducing logistics ships, it has made some of the matches boring and long, but not terribly so like in the first few ats. i think it is more of range being a bit overpowered in the at as ranged ships gets their range handed to them on a silver platter while short range ships have to fight an uphill battle just to get within range. they need better camera operators showing the interesting parts of the action (sometimes they are ok and sometimes way off) as well as better commentators. i know verone/veto is an at brosef, but good god how did you let ryas commentate, it was just awful. give the commentators some energy drink or speed or something, because they sound so dull and bored when they should be excited at watching a cool battle and tell us all the details. commentators also need some tools to know wtf is going on, it's off-putting to hear ""experts"" say i dunno what is going on or i think i know what is happening, but not sure. great, you aren't sure what is going on, awesome intel ryas. you realize you were talking about some random topic and missed the critical scimitar die and now you are confused what is going on, right ryas?i like this tournament, but it could be better. the entry process needs to be completely reworked, but the hd stream and hd youtube videos are completely win.supporting something, not sure what."
9/25/2009,"learn to do the mission. i can run it the entire set of missions from recon 1 to 3, level 4, with any alt that can fit a shield tanked celestis. so can you, it isn't rocket science.that being said, i support the idea."
9/25/2009,"i agree, it's getting stupid! i get that fanfest is next week and there is allot to do but quite frankly i don't give a monkeys!either do the job properly or don't do it at all imho.-cj"
9/25/2009,brilliant. it's everywhere except on eve's own site - you know - where most actual paying pilots go?
9/25/2009,"op starts with:given the almost complete disregard that csm have displayed in the directional scanner issue, it would appear the answer to your question is...no."

9/25/2009,thread cleaned of off topic conversations. there are other more appropriate threads for other conversations.
9/25/2009,"\o/ power to the people!i'll skirt the edge of topic to suggest this:one thing missing from options to discuss would be investigating the possiblity of shortening the timer in lieu of removing it. if there really exists a happy region in the 500-1100ms range (for example) that is workable for the scouts and doesn't greatly impact lag, then it's by far and away the easiest option to implement.then you've covered all the bases i think."
9/25/2009,"i say again...""jita park speakers cornera less formal venue to discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar management""i would like to discuss the csm emotional stability, i sensed alot of rage in the ""unclean"" version of this thread"
9/25/2009,"hello,respectfully, i would like to make a comment.certainly, they will not revert to the old delay-less scanner mechanic. however, that thread with 1200+ supporting posters, is not calling for a mere reversal of the change which was made. we can all appreciate the impact which the delay-less directional scanner had on server performance, and many have acknowledged the need for a control to prevent lag caused by scanner spam.several great ideas have been put forth in that thread, which would improve the situation without reversing the initial decision to impose a delay on directional scanning. some proposed changes have involved things such as: ~ adding a visual indication of the directional scanner's remaining delay time (a meter which displays when scan is ready again)~ lowering the delay to half a second or one second~ removing delay on narrow scans of 90 degrees or less (preventing 360 degree spam, but allowing for smoother scouting)~ adding an automatic scan feature which automatically pings every two seconds~ adding a visual indicator of whether the items shown in the scan are from the most recent scan, or have not yet been updated due to scan delay (presently, combat notifications occlude the ""directional scanner delay message"", making it hard to determine whether a scan has been performed or not)many of us would be grateful if you would consider presenting some of these suggestions, for modification of the present game mechanic, during this weekend's csm meeting."

9/26/2009,"supported even thoug i dont use overloading, i can see the importance of a fast way to activate it.i often find myself stressed in battles because there are so much to do in such a short amount of time, with that overloading issue it will only take longer."
9/26/2009,"i ver mych agree in much of what you say. autocannons really do need a boost in some way. i'm not sure about the hail, at the moment republic fleet emp is not so far behind and has none of the negative side effects of hail. reducing the negative side effects (especially tracking) would atleast make it a ammo type you can cosider to use. i completely agree about the vargur and also about the artillery. i like the navy phoon and the normal phoon. i do not like the target painter bonus on the tempest. what i do like is though the slot layout. it would make the tempest more unique instead of what it is now. as you said, whatever you decide to do with the tempest there is something that does it better. i have nothing against making a target apiting bonus but only giving it range is not gonna help. giving it like 25% range bonus and effectiveness per level would make it more interesting. anyway, great work man, i'm glad someone is trying to make a difference."

9/26/2009,"sorry, maz, can't support the specifics that you're proposing, although i think that continuity is important and a change is needed to help ensure it. item 1: four continuing members is too many--for all the reasons stated by non-supporters already. two would be plenty. staggered terms might also help with continuity although i'm not sure how the system might be painlessly and fairly converted from as-is to that. item 2: way too subjective. even if ccp had very good reasons, i can already hear the whines and moans from the players whose favorite candidate got rejected out of hand.item 3: issler should not have this partial term counted against of eligibility to run again. however, i believe that partial terms that result from someone dropping out due to rl or a failure to meet their obligations should be counted against that eligibility.so...very much in your camp regarding the importance of continuity, but just can't support the specific ideas you've proposed."
9/26/2009,"i have a proposal for wardeccs, which clearly need some work... i expect all griefers will flame this thread, it isnt polished and will need more ideas, but at least it is an idea. apologies for anything here that others have posted, but i dont trawl forums..wars can only be fought in systems of less security than 0.8, just like the pos anchoring rule. the reason for this would be that concord and the factions dont want fighting going on in the most populous systems.war! wardeccers should have a valid reason to wardec, like for instance one of their members was attacked somewhere, this is enough reason for war. if there is a valid reason for the wardecc, the following rule will not apply.the price of war. if a corp wants to randomly wardecc another corp, this is still perfectly valid (as this is a pvp game primarily) but, corps have a concord security rating. if the security rating of th ecorp you are wardeccing is higher than yours, you take a hit to that rating. corp security would work exactly like personal security in that when you go below certain level, your access to higher security systems is restricted, (but you dont go flashy red, only npc security can shoot you)the price of a wardecc should increase, with the difference in sec levels of the corps, ie if corp a (sec 1) wardeccs corp b (sec 8) it would be far more expensive than deccing a corp who also had sec 1. a flat fee (like the current one) should be there for deccing corps who have actively shot your members.obviously this is only a start to making wars more playable, for all involved. it is aimed at making griefing have a price, and for wars to actually need a reason for happening, but also providing a place where those who absolutely dont want to fight wars, a place to live, and play rather than quit eve in frustration, it does none of us any good if people leave the game. it doesnt stop those corps who want to wardecc for easier targets, but it makes it have some cost. wars will still be prolific, and carebears do need to go to 0.7 and below, becasue that is where pos's are.if this is coupled with tax and other penalties for being in an npc corp, i think it will encourage alot more pc corps, and alot more action, but the action will more often be between people who are happy to have that type of action...now, ideas, critics and of course griefers flame away..."

9/26/2009,"people who dont want to pvp should of course be allowed this option. naturally, this means that they wont want to use the market, mine scarce resources, anchor pos, covert lp, or place or accept open contracts.alternatively, if people want to be immune from combat pvp in 0.8 and above, that's fine too, so long as they are compelled them to sell their stuffs to me only at npc list price. just as they want their ships to be immune from my combat pvp, i want my wallet to be immune to their market pvp."
9/26/2009,why do wardecs need a nerf? what problems does your proposal solve?
9/26/2009,"this isnt about pvp, this is about the wardecc mechanic. which at the moment is used almost predominantly for griefing of industrial corporations.many people are saying the mechanic needs changing, even ccp acknowledge the wardecc system needs work, this is merely a proposal. dont take it personally just because your version of pvp is to kill industrials and carebears who are easy targets for the epeen.i sincerely believe, and so do many others, that the wardecc mechanic is very flawed, from both sides of the coin, ie, being able to bail from a decc by joining, then leaving an alliance, to the fact that it is used as legal piracy. from a storyline and roleplaying point of view (and no, im not an rper either) it also makes no sence whatsoever that concord and faction police are totally ok withthe idea of grief corps legaly pirating industrial corps, who have done nothing to deserve it.from a business point of view, it is also a problem, because quite simply, people leave the game due to griefers spoiling the way they play the game, just because they can. if people leave the game it is bad for everyone.as i suspected, the stream of flame that is basically from griefers. so, how about some constructive critisism, not just bleating please?"
9/26/2009,"not bad. does need polish, but i very much like the idea of corps having sec ratings that affect the wardec cost."
9/26/2009,i like the idea of wars costing more / less depending on what sec system the corp wants the dec to be applicable to.also i like the idea of wars costing more the longer they go on for.i think really the whole war dec thing just needs to be made that little more difficult. oh yeah i like that to
9/26/2009,"make them pay in ships and implants. a 2-3 person griefercops is no match for a 20-30 person blob of rifter-flying industrialists. if you want to avoid putting your implants at risk, make a combat alt. it won't take much training time to make an alt that will be dangerous to them if you outnumber them, and not much practice time to learn to fly together. would you be prepared to pay concord for that privilege? that would make your proposal more supportable.in its current form, not supported."
9/26/2009,one more thing -- don't assume that everyone who disagrees with you is a griefer. i'm not.
9/26/2009,"i know. thanks for the compliment and yes, you're right, i'm ""normally"" more... reserved.the main reason i pressed the support button is because i've noticed that people tend to notice threads if there are more thumbs up on it. especially if the topic is pure flame fuel.but, have to admit, the thought has occured to me. but mainly becuase every tiime there is a discussion about wardecs, there's a constant stream of people parroting: ""wardecs are fine"". is it? let me tell you a story:the first time i got wardeced was when my old corp was werdeced, right after we'd joined an alliance in order to avoid wardecs (first lame thing about wardecs). ironic i know. but our agressors didn't know that this alliance was set up for the single purpose of deploying a defence force against wardec ""leet pirates"" or rather (imo) ""mercs with no clients"".we where all mission runners and no experience. but i was really excited, not the first time i had experienced pew pew, but the first time was... less than impressive. this time i could prepare, because this time i knew that i would have to be prepared to loose my ship (the first time i lost my ship in lowsec, and i fully accepted that it was my own fault).yet we managed to turn the tide in the end, and our agressors started to dock up all the time. i logged on every day excited! i was ready to get these guys, and we where very close to doing more damage in isk than they had done. but most of them didn't even log on, and the ones that did mostly stayed docked, hoping we would make a mistake.later on we got wardeced again, after that i left the corp and joined a 0.0 corp. thins changed, and before i knew it, i was the ceo of a new corp, and i found an alliance for us to join. at last i could see it for myself! and the pvp was.. very different, but far more entertaining. it felt as if i was playing a different game before!then my life suddenly changed (irl). i didn't have as much time to devote to eve anymore. my corp fell apart. fair enough. i went back to highsec and started to train up for a marauders. i got a marauder. i did missions. it wasn't the same, but never the less, i still enjoyed it.i'm still enjoying it. i would love to pvp, but even in 0.0 (where i was, there was almost always some thing to chase/get chased by), i've found that most people try to avoid pew pew unless they think they are going to win. not very different from mission runners funny enough.when you are defended by concord and have stations to dock in all over, what is the risk of declaring war against another corp of your choosing? it's like having your cake and eating it. and in this case you are guranteed that if you choose the right cake you will like that cake.what's the consequense of choosing the wrong cake? where's the inspiration to make you go out there and get that cake? even if you're the deccer and have decced the wrong corp, the is no incentive to go out there and try to get even. the mechanic indirectly inspires people to not even log on. even the people that are pro this mechanic say that if you don't want to fight, go do something else and wait it out.that's really good advice for a person that is new to this game and is really excited about it. but unfortunately, it won't make him wan't to stay. after all, would you want to pay for a game that you hardly know and can't play?the wardec mechanic is only good for attacking noobs, and be honest now, is there really need for a whole ""mechanic"" dedicated to take advantage of noobs? if it's that hard for you to get at noobs, maybe you should go play another game.tl;dr: i like the concept of having wars in eve, but the execution is so terrible that i would rather get rid of the whole thing than let it stay the way it is."
9/26/2009,"basically, 0.0 > all other pvp. learn to risk it. if there where more of you out there, i could get back out there, even with as little time as i have. it's the best the game has to offer. you have all the tools available in the game, and there's a reason to fight rather than docking up.0.0 is the best part of the game, but it needs more people that aren't super hardcore in it. if there was as much traffic in 0.0 as there is in low traffic highec, 0.0 would be perfect. living out of a pos needs a bit of polishing though. it's painful!but not being able to dock is imho the best feature of 0.0, because ""you can run, but you can't hide"". stations everywhere and docking games are a sin to this game. arenas sound like a good idea simply because running away is not an option.i never run away in games. in eve, you have to run away. but only because everyone else does it, and because in a lot of scenarios you've already determined that you can't win. i don't mind loosing ships. i can grind a bit more, and i'm lucky enough to enjoy a bit of grinding.but when i i need to spend two hours+ chasing/hiding from someone in order to get a kill, i don't see the point. two hours is the amount of time i can spend on eve in a day (and not every day) and if that's too little for me to be able to pop something every now and then, then i'm not gonna bother.and again, i'm not complaining. i'm happy doing missions. and i would like eve to stay here as long as possible. if eve grows, eve stays. wardecs disrupt the one thing that kept eve interesting to me at the time i joined a corp: interaction with other players. without it, i would never had come as far as i have.now i'm fine, and at the time we got wardeced i was fine. but had we been wardeced ealrier, i don't think i would have been. i fairly sure i would have left the corp, and eventualy left the game. mind you, the hmm channel has always been good to me, and that might have kept me in the game, but i doubt it.i could never have gotten the kind of support, help and guidance that i did by joining that corp i first joined before the npc corp. wardecs break these apart. is there a need for such a mechanic? is it really healthy for the game? is there risk involved with wardecs?i say nay! wardecs need some attention, and no minor balancing. it shouldn't be attractive for people to ""declare war"", even in eve. maybe if it was a bit more fun. perhaps make it a bit more like 0.0? no docking and no concord for 1 week! that is, others are protected, but you arent! now that sounds like fun"
9/26/2009,"can't support the idea of removing war decs. they serve a useful purpose sometimes. for example, for low sec pirates, war decs are useful to ensure we can engage positive sec status anti-pirates and fw people at will on gates and stations w/out fear of sentries."
9/26/2009,"the problem is that these areas don't change anything.wormhole anomalies affect everyone in the wormhole identically, so the net result is... no change at all.if spacial effects are to be used 'tactically' they have to provide an advantage to one party over their opponent.where this would work to a tactical advantage best would be faction warfare where a ship has to fly to and 'hack' (or activate) a structure or module within the conflict space (fw complex, et al), and then remain within a certain range to enjoy the benefits of that 'effect'.to remove the effect the enemy force has to destroy the item or send their own 'hacker' over and attempt to turn it over.for in space anomalies you'd have a sliding scale of effect... the longer a ship is there the more they gain (or more they are penalized), prompting people to either set up a lead-in trap to use the advantage of the zone or attempt to chase/lead their foes into it and attempt to hold them there while the penalty stacks up.it /could/ work, but not in the current 'blanket' nature it follows now."
9/26/2009,"wrong. it's all about awareness, a wh roaming gang won't take into account their gang composition/fitting for any effect, but soemone 'residing' in a wh which boosts shield tanking i.e. will take it into account. result is the residing gang will have a tremendous advantage over the other gang if they know how to use it.this won't work on k-space for the same reason: awareness, everyone in k-space knows where is travelling, so they will just fit according to the system/region7constellation. in w-space you can't decide where do you got to thate xtend, and best thing, you don't have easy logistics even if you knew where you are going so not soe asy to refit for it.only way this would work is dynamic changing effects (daily) in regions/systems/constellations."
9/26/2009,your points are valid but your misunderstanding like many that this may effect players with a bad internet connection.this is entirely about people who exploit a game mechinic that allows them to cheat their way out of their ships destruction.also ccp does not reimburse you because your internet is crappy... trust me i've tried once or twice.
9/26/2009,"(a) i never lose them , i never fly them , they are fail just as indicated by the data.(b) sweeping statement , not proof offered, critisism invalid.(a) no evidence offered , solo / small gang kills score more points , but fleets get more kills, large sample sizes on fleet ships proves this hypothesis is a myth.(b) poster is unable to grasp increadible simple concept that the data sampled only goes back 1 year , point is moot.(c) mail after death results in km being attributed to capsule.ship effectiveness after death = 0. effectivness is sound metric to pull from data.(d) small gang /solo objection allready debunked. top guns know the value of ships , just because ego's wont allow this to sink in in no way invalidates pop metric.failfits in the data would invalidate the exercies, if fail fits are victims registered in ""kills with"" they will be so proportionnally for all ships tested , not a source of bias.(1) requires the exercise of opinion , steadfastly rejected as it would colour the results via my own opinion of what should be equal.measureing hacs v frigs would be a pointless exercide , we all know hac > frigs allready , poster should know this allready.if smaller ships are above bigger ships in the list , they are there because they are proportionaly better in there own group than the larger ships are in theres.keeping each group to 1 ship from each race, where those ships are racial equivs is what allows the user of the data to see the racial bias in the first place.frigates are not penalised for being cheap they only compete for rank points with there class equivs , this must be born in mind when analysing the data posted.munnin has good sample size and excelent effeciancy showing it is an excellent sniper when flown by a competent pilot.group size is kept to 4 to ensure popularity metric is not undully favourable to ship in small group sizes.(2) you have the data if you want to experiment."
9/26/2009,"just had a glace through the raw data for spikes in exe activitylooks like there may have been 2 such incidents1 in august with approx 37 killsand a smaller 1 in may about 10 killsthere a spike in march too , but its inconclusive if it was the same thing.i knew nothin of this incident, yet managed to guess how the ship was being used after looking at the item database entry for the ship.it would never have occured to anyone that the exe might actually be a decent pvp ship.but then along came this analysis and it showed us all the light.this is amazing proof that the dataset was appropriate and the analysis valid.bigger men at this point would admit they were initially mistaken and start getting support behind this thread."
9/26/2009,"clueless response, 1/10.large sample sizes while reasonably common for all pilots are not the way to score points.in a 15 man rr bs gang, you get ~1 to ~1.5 points for a bs kill. to get the same amount of points you get from a frigate kill in a destroyer it takes 6-10 kills in the same rr bs gang.therefore, while pilots may or may not be participating in fleet / large gang action, they did not get ranked that way.generally we use random datasets for a reason to prevent biased results.data selection criterion greatly impacted by data out of timeframe. resulting data less reliable.blackbird comes in, jams 4 damage dealers (eg. 700 dps) for 20 seconds, dies within 5 seconds since he's a noob. total damage negated: 56.000 effective damage, not counting time to pop.bellicose comes in, starts firing. it is not primary as people go 'lol, bellicose' and keep doing their merry business. friendly gang dies / hostile gang dies in less then 150 seconds (preety damn common, and i'm assuming maximum skills for the bellicose pilot): bb wins on gang utility, bellicose wins on ""hi, i ninjaed on all the kms and probably got out when **** hit the fan.result for your analysis: your metric is worthless for evaluating gang scenarios.since it fails in the example above, it fails overall as anything even resembling ""proof"". the whole scheme of making a global ranking is laughable to begin with. it's comparing apples to oranges. what makes sense are comparisons within a shipclass (and, eg. hacs are, for all practical intents and purposes, one shipclass, unless you want to split them by role, in which case good luck cathegorising them. so are t1 cruisers - bar ew cruisers maybe. so are t1 frigates.). in this way we could say something like ""ok, caldari frigate/cruisers suck, their x is ok, y is not"" which makes it possible to draw useful conclusions (naturally, provided you fix your efficiency metric). also, popularity being bundled with efficiency is a mistake."

9/26/2009,"the only thing this is ""amazing proof"" of is that a couple of nights of drunken pvp'ing by very good pilots completely skews the data. therefore any testing done using the data is in error and any conclusions drawn from the testing are blatantly wrong.do you know why the atron is 4th on your list of top ships? or the imicus even in your list? for the very same reasons as the exequror. very good pvp'ers deliberately take out bad pvp ships against weak opposition knowing it's so much easier to bait with these ships as everyone else knows they are rubbish for pvp and will engage freely. it's the skills of the pilot winning not because of these ships but inspite of these ships.see, it's the human factor. your saying ships of race a are weaker than ships of race b based on some historical figures. but those figures are based (in part on) 1, alcohol and 2, sh**s and giggles.you don't understand the game mechanics yet are calling for fundamental changes to them...?bigger men at this point would admit they were initially mistaken, realise they are getting no support and let this thread die off."
9/26/2009,"i can't decide which is more ridiculous... the whole point that the op is making, or his complete refusal to listen to anyone trying to explain why he is wrong.listen, dav, even if your analysis was valid, which it isn't, and even if this does in fact indicate that caldari & amarr need a boost, which they don't, then all you've proven is that two specific race's ships are more suited for a specific type of pvp. killbaords don't tell the whole story, i'm sorry but you just cannot make a decision about tuning the game based on killboard stats.i havfe *never* been in a battle where the resulting killboard data gave the true picture of which ships or players were important and why one side did better than another. the picture is *always* incomplete because it doesn't include information like:- who was doing the scouting? how did the two sides meet? was one fleet hunting and the other trying to hide, and if so, what ships were being used to hunt?- or, was it a case of two fleets wanting to fight and ending up in a close-range slugfest with no tactical dancing around beforehand? did one side have less firepower but more ewar?- did one side have more logistics? was this fight on a station so people could dock, repair, and undock easily?- was this even two pvp fleets, or was it just one pvp fleet and a bunch of carebears trying to defend themselves?all of these factors are not shown on a killboard but they all have a significant effect on the way the fight pans out. people who specialise in caldari know that their forte is ewar, and those ships are always paper-thin and primaried first, they will *always* look like **** on a killboard. but they are vital and the game would be a poorer place if you persuaded ccp to remove these racial differences.there's a reason why ccp has never supported killboards or run their own. if killboards were a recognised as an official ranking of any sort, fleet pvp in this game would die out overnight, and everyone would just camp gates and rack up easy kills.all you will ever achieve by acting on an analysis like this, is to make all the races the same, when the racial specialisations are what makes the game more interesting than most.i am really sick of this kind of crap - people wandering in and playing the game for a few weeks or months, then deciding that they know better than people who have played for years. every argument you have put forward in this thread has shown your understanding of pvp to be superficial at best, and more likely completely non-existant.i hate the kind of people who have high scores on killboards. i don't want the game to be reduced to that. the people who score highly on bc are good at what they do, but that's only a tiny part of eve and it's fine that gall or mini ships are best at *that* type of gameplay. caldari ships are monsters at pve but you don't see minmatar players crying their eyes out about that, do you? it's a big game, with lots of different playstyles and a huge range of ships that don't all have to excel at every type of play.so, in short, get lost. you have made assumptions before you started that are 100% wrong and as aresult not only is your conclusion erroneous but your self-confidence is completely misplaced. you need to get over yourself.i will close with one observation. in my years of playing this game, many times i have been on the losing end of a fight and the one explanation that i have heard 100x more than any other, the one factor that keeps rising up to account for why we just got smashed by a smaller fleet, the one element that has been decisive in fights in every system, since forever:""they had more ewar than us""moderated.applebabe they already have a huge influence on the outcome of every fight."
9/26/2009,"... you're trying to prove assertion a. someone points out that a essential part of the proof is mere speculation (that your efficiency ranking has any bearing on actual efficiency within a gang). what does this do to a?it makes it fail as proof.the possibility of such a scenario invalidates efficiency as a valid metric for proving anything at all. poster is however able to grasp how manipulative is a global list as posted in the original post as a result of global ship ordering and separating every shipclass into tiers + adding popularity on top.at any rate, since you offer no credible proof to your whining, you get only a rating of 5/10 for trolling, just because of the effort."
9/26/2009,bb/falcon/rook/scorp look like sh*t because they are dangerous and get primary often.ewar -> logistic -> dps
9/26/2009,"hmmm on the atron imicus this i was not sure what you were talking about.the post was made erroneously , i had accidentelly listed by the wrong column, whoopsie.corrected that post, atron was in possition 27 , behind the drake.that was not the full dset by the way , just an example i was showing to oo to show that the bias is still there even if ew related groups were not counted.on the point you make about the exe.there was a good reason you buddies choose the exe.its the only t1 logi that can do what they did.it could be argued that the same was possible with the osprey , but remote shield tanking < remote armor tanking.the fact that they were drunk and doing it for ****s and giggles as you put it only confirms that the exe is a better ship than even the stats shown.what could they have done sober and serious ???this is the first spreadsheet i have ever seen that indicates worthy pvp ships, which would ortherwise go unnoticed by the general population.as such it is complete vindication of the dataset i have choosen and equations i have applied.there are 60,000+ people playing this game.this is a democratic forum , not a playground , i will not close down this thread because a small group of player dont happen to like what it shows."
9/26/2009,"what you consider a good ship i consider a flying coffin.too valuable to be left alive by the opposition and too slow and no tank. < thats really not a great combination.the bb needs to lose a mid and gain a low to balance out its offence v defence imo.but thats my opinion lets look at some facts.your scenario about the bb is just that, one scenario.it may be as effective as you point out , but that is just one scenario.it is fundamentalley flawed to point to just one scenario and then say look this ship is uber because it can do this.you even went on to post lol crap about the belli , because you happen to consider it a worthless ship.while your bb may have done what it did, you fully admit it died first.so for the rest of that engagement where a belly would have been providing its own dps + increasing the dps of all your fleet ships the bb did preciselly 0.so not only was your scenario coloured by your opinions of the ships involved you have completelly ignored the 99,999 other scenario's played out on tranq everyday, all of them unique.and there are plenty of situation where the last ship you want to be in is a bb , when you undock you never know what eve combat will bring you.so you have brought to the table 1 scenario to prove the worth of a ship the bb.i have brought the results of 95 years worth of expert pvp opinion.non of it my own.this study is so much more valuable than your opinion the ratio can not even be quantified."

9/26/2009,crossposting is frowned upon by the forum admins.and the garbage posts are your own as it is.
9/26/2009,"i listen ( read ) every post.most of the posts offer nothing more than opinions without reasoning.""listen, dav, even if your analysis was valid, which it isn't""like this ^^"", and even if this does in fact indicate that caldari & amarr need a boost, which they don't,""and this ^^""stuff about killboards,scouting,fleet composition,logistics and other variables""yes any study of eve is very complicated, thousands of mods,billions of fitting combinations,trillions of scenarios.people are in the habit of looking at stuff in isolation and basing there assumptions on whether some thing is good or bad based on there own limited experiances.analysis of km's while it would offer more information , is complecated by many factor, fittings , pilot competency, situation ( which is not evident in km's as you point out ) and even if it were possible to make sense of all that data , in order to reconstruct the information into a meningful linear list would require the exercise of opinion ( my own ) on the value of certain scenario's over others. making the whole exercise pointless.""all of these factors are not shown on a killboard but they all have a significant effect on the way the fight pans out. people who specialise in caldari know that their forte is ewar, and those ships are always paper-thin and primaried first, they will *always* look like **** on a killboard. but they are vital and the game would be a poorer place if you persuaded ccp to remove these racial differences.""yeah to be effective most caldari ew fits flown have to sacrifice tanks for offensive ewar. this is there downfall shown in the results.all races have ewar , gal have damps and long range scrams , amarr have trackin dissies and long range nos/neut , mini have tp's and long range websi cant make coment about every possible type of settup. but generally i think there a lot more versatile and dont have to sacrifice defence to the same extent as caldari to be affective.your acceptance of cew being virtual suicide and that being ok is amusing.btw no-one is asking ccp for any specific type of change in this thread.people are picking up on cew beceause there positions in the list are counter-intuitive to there own in-game experiances and there trying to point to that to rubbish the finding.to be continued.... ( due to length of post )"
9/26/2009,"off topic , no one is asking for an official kb in this thread.different but balanced is what should be sought imo.no-one is asking for it all to be the same.i'm not sure where you get the couple of weeks thing from , i've been playing for 5 years on this char, not that that matters.hmm and lol.its not ok for one race to have supperiority in pvp over others it reduces the options for pvp play.all races being balanced for pvp would introduce more option and make the game better.if someone else want to bring up balance pve threads i will more than willing support them if they make sense. personaly i am happy with my gallente pve boat.do you see what i meant about posts containing nothing more than insults and opinions wthout evidence ?your incompentence does not interest me, but does help to invalidate any opinions you have expressed so far."
9/26/2009,"you are. it's in the thread title.kind of you to mention the 60,000 subscribers to eve. q: how many of these 60,000 support your theory?a: 1 (you)that one other guy gave it a thumbs up and he quite clearly states he's not supporting you just trolling. invalid ballot.why is it no one agrees with you? why is it only you have seen the glory of the coming of the lord? how come you are so far ahead of the rest of us on this evolutionary bell curve called eve?every time you preach about the data and your theory i keep picturing a fundamental creationist clinging to his bible as hard as he can and ranting at anybody and everybody about biblical inerrancy."
9/26/2009,"look, you can beat around the issue this way or that, your metrics and methods make your 'research' utterly futile for proving anything.since you cannot prove any of your claims, well... yes, your personal opinion that caldari/amarr need a boost has been noted."
9/26/2009,"i am amazed that you still are continuing this topic while it's getting nowhere.the problem here is that you have given us readers a lot of statistics which we question because we don't find the source and your method reliable. on this you base you entire proposal to boost two races.what you are doing wrong here is:1 your method2 the global boostinstead of looking at individual ships and how they perform in certain situations you look at a global overview based on an unreliable source and say this needs a boost.what you are doing wrong is not looking at the ships or giving us a solution on how to boost them, because that's what it's all about. giving a solution for the problem and not just a problem described in numbers and telling ccp to sort it out. even if this somehow miraculous gets picked up by a csm member i will bet a crapton of isk on it this never gets voted in onto the issues list.your assumption that support will flood in after we have seen ""the light"" is wrong, there is no light to see here."
9/26/2009,"it is hard to coordinate fleet, in a big battle, and find out which exact target is jammed, which target is scrammed. for example, let's say you are in gang of 5 people, every one of you has a web, and scram. suddenly you get jumped by another gang of 5. so while your fc calls primary, you need to make sure that a) all dps in on primaryb) every single red is scrammedc) certain ships are jammedd) certain ships are webbed. currently we have 2 ways of figuring this oput- sooming in to every singe ship and trying to figure out what e-war is affecting it, which is rather time consuming, and is pretty hard with rockets, smart bombs, energy neuts and tens of other visual effects that affect target at the same time. you can figure out who is jamming what over voip, but even with best organization it takes a while, and odds are you have to jamm something first, or it will be too late. so currently coordinating is hard. so here is what i have to offer:when you target a ship, like on the right we currently have everything we are affecting it with, under the icon of the target we have all effects that are being projected on him. aoe effects will not be displayed. putting cursor over icon of the icon of the effect will cause 2 things to happen:1) it will create a line on hud from the target to the source/sources of the effector,and it will highlight them on the overview, so i see who is repping the target, and who is scramming it. 2) it will display scale of the effect, so when i put my cursor over the warp disruptor icon, it says 3, it means that target has 3 distruptors on it, it will say name of the person projecting the effects, and how many of the effects he is projecting.we get a status bar for you ship somewhere near the capacitor ui, that says if your ships is being scrammed, webbed, whatnot, and by who, putting mouse over the icon will cause things listed above to happen. we get separate icons for warp scram and warp distruptor. this will greatly help fc's to observe what is going on in the battle. you could also have an option that would create lines between ships with colour according to effect that is being projectied, and arrow showing it's direction, like if ship a is jamming ship b, there will be blue arrow pointing at ship b from ship a. there will be a number next to the arrow, or maybe thicker line or few lines if there is more then one effect being projected of the same kind. that way fc sees right away, which of the 12 battleships on the field are repping, who is draining cap, and who is remote sensor boosting the septor so none's pods can get away."
9/26/2009,i endorse improving coordination and suggest a strong look at the fleet command tab be revised and improved.
9/26/2009,"i don't think your proposal is exactly right, but it's a strong start. i'm cool with people being able to see better what ew their gang is using."
9/26/2009,"i should have seen this one before posting by proposal for a strategic command ship, which in essence also calls for a new fleet overview role."
9/26/2009,"ofcource my proposal is not going to be exactly right, i am jsut average user trying to make a thought through suggestion, now if the core idea is valid the professional game developers will do it the way it really should be done.anothjer detail: maybe the lines of effects could be shown when you turn tactical overlay on, now it is almost useless, or maybe instead of having a line the visual effect could be highlighted so it stands out or is clearly visible, eg. it is made brighter."
9/26/2009,not killmails plz. that would just be stupid. something else (*anything*) would be fine though.
9/26/2009,"you are clearly not a carrier pilot. losing fighters is a pain...at 15m each, instead of 400k for a drone. totally agreed!"
9/26/2009,"the simplest solution is to make the light green when normal, red/yellow when overloaded.and it changes color immediately, not after the new cycle. that would already help a lot, now is the green icon could be made a pixed or 2 higher that would pretty much make it easier for everyone. i am just offering another way to solve this. full support."
9/26/2009,"do it! do it now! before ambulation, before the new sovierinity patch, before you go to bed tonight! this would be the biggest upgrade the game has had this far."
9/26/2009,"while i'm sure debating the employment policies of some random company is amusing to all of us, let's boil this down to something a bit more germane. you want ccp to put effort in so that you can use api tools when operating through a firewall that blocks www.eve-online.com and only that one address. i can understand why you want it, but why should they be bothered giving it to you? it's minor, even for people affected by it, and it can't affect many people. i'd me more swayed by an argument of helping people who make typos than i would be by this one."
9/26/2009,"i propose to remove sentry guns from lowsec, since i allready think the security given by the npc, is driven to an extend not even realistic.first some whiningi feel it reduces the ability to pvp, tremendously...think about it, a pirate spends at least an hour finding a target, when he finds one it is very likely its near a station or a stargate, if the pirate is in a ship that cant tank the sentries, hes gonna have to watch the target fly safely away.i have tried and tried for several hours of play to find a target, and the only places i ever find ones are at stargates or stations where these lovely sentries are, really, its so discouraging and frustating...i know i havent tried as much as some of the real eve pirates have but even for players not into it shouldnt be something scaring them away from even trying.now i understand there are some people (i prefer calling em cowards) carebears that would watch their world perish if their protection dissapeared, thats why im only suggesting it for lowsec so that the people that want to pvp can have it that way and are not being hindered by some bloody sentries...another idea i have is to not remove them, but allow the players to destroy them and say let em reappear in a few days, that allows the pirates/pvp'ers to actually shape the areas they operate in, i understand it would have a big impact on security stats, but pirates are ready to take those consequenses..concord doesnt really make the eve universe better and scarier, its more like a kindergarden where the adults tells the kids what they can and what they can't, disallowing the kids to have the fun the way they want to.now the finale.allow players to kill the sentries in 0.0 - 0.5, and make em reappear a few days later, make the sec hit balanced according to the crime (no not ****ing -2 for killing a bloody sentry)it should allow for some more risky and dangerous gameplay (cause really i thought eve was supposed to be a dangerous universe but its really not)ya know some people really want it to be dangerous and most people ive heard wants it that way, the game just doesnt seem to be harsh enough,if people just cant take loosing stuff, fine, they should stay in 0.6 - 1.0, yea i know you can just say ""go to 0.0 then"" yea cause theres gonna be more targets, say whole alliances with +100 people, yea sure ill take em on solo anytime"
9/26/2009,"some more ideas for features people would like to see introduced to contracts came up in this thread.removal of courier contract volume limits.contract window filters to search for blueprints by me/pe range, minimum run count, and original/copy.auction contracts assignable to a corporation.right-click option on market and non-market items (as hotlinked or in a hangar) to view available contracts.interest-paying loan contracts with collateral (such as bpos).collateral and completion time options for item exchange contracts.contract api.share trading through contracts.item search function in contract history.option to award a bonus for early completion of courier contracts."
9/26/2009,"easiest way to fix the damaged item problem would be to allow damged items to be contracted and have the details column display 'damaged - 2/40 hp' for mods or 'damaged - 0/10 armor - 1/10 structure' for ships, similar to how bpos/bpcs are distinguished."
9/26/2009,"more annoyances:- it isn't possible to create a corp contract from items in a personal hangar.- illegal item restrictions on item exchange contracts. you can post a contract requesting them, so why can't you post one offering them?- inability to view courier contents.- only complains about oversized descriptions after you attempt to create the contract, instead of just not letting you type in a description that long in the first place."
9/26/2009,"we need an api to retrieve character or corp blueprint data, with information about location, type (original/copy), me, pe, licenced runs remaining and max runs per copy etc. and of course what they are doing, if they are locked in research/manufacturing/copying."
9/26/2009,"assuming their system can handle it without it taking too much effort, yeah."
9/26/2009,"no.it's not about the apathy of the general population. i can already see mountains of false accusations piled up - and it doesn't matter how many warnings you give, because you cannot stop the people who think they are correct in reporting whatever they are reporting, or just act on a moments weakness. filling out the form on the site gives some time to cool off and review the facts."
9/26/2009,"i'd like to see a gm watching jita chat, so isk spammers in jita are quickly banned. i doubt it would be that hard and would reduce the amount of petitions for isk spammers and make it overall less of a problem"
9/26/2009,currently isk spammers have a loophole.you can only create 2 petitions at a time.so they bring in 3-4 bots in each wave.
9/26/2009,"that sounds good, but what i would like to see is gm's sitting cloaked in their special frigates in the starter systems while they do their daily petition answering thing so they can globally mute any isk spammers that are born in each system."
9/26/2009,"fixed your post.and supported, if the gms won't do something proactive about isk seller spam, at least make it easier for us to do their job for them."
9/26/2009,supportedalso the last time i petitioned an isk spammer the petition was answered in under 5 seconds of me sending it
9/26/2009,"this. local as is in high sec is fine. i can think of all kinds of logical reasons in the context of new eden why it might exist and be maintained as a service there. no local in null sec and delayed in low sec (like in wormholes) would be ideal. having spent some time in wormholes, i like the idea of having to use tools and skill to find out who else is there. also, without all those server hits to populate local chat data, maybe it would offset scanner hits by enough to give us our old d-scanner functionality back."
9/26/2009,"local in 0.0 needs to be changed yes, but it doesnt need to be removed. the main problem with local atm is it's used as the ultimate early warning system. i've done a hell of a lot of roaming in my time and i've seen it happen time and time again that the very moment someone comes in local that people mining and ratting go cloaky cloaky or more often run to the pos in the system.local does have a purpose, as someone said before if your system is under attack you need to know the numbers against you, but at the time time local should not be a tool for people to avoid the risks of 0.0.i'd say a fair compromise would be so lets say put a 60 second or so delay on local. anyone who's ratting or npc'ing who's doing it right and checking their scanner won't have a problem, but anyone who uses local to avoid the inherant dangers 0.0 is supposed to have will learn that surviving in 0.0 should take more than just looking at local and running to a pos the moment a neutral comes in the system."
9/26/2009,no thx.or make scaneable cloaked ships too and end of 23/7 cloak if end of 23/7 intel too.
9/26/2009,no thanks. would make cloaked ships incredibly overpowered and make ratting/mining a lot more boring. go to wormholes if you want no local.high sec does not need this buff.
9/26/2009,i agree
9/26/2009,not supported at all. i'm getting rather tired of this issue being brought up tbh.
9/26/2009,"i do support this idea, ive been thinking about it myself, ive been trying out piracy, and ive really been discouraged and frustrated when jumping in to a lowsec, watching system being emptyed a few seconds later cause ive been spotted in local, it just frustrating,if you ask me, the eve universe is just waaaay too secure, the extend of concord is just bizarre"
9/26/2009,"come on, any other suggestions? because i think this a little bit prenerfed."
9/26/2009,"honestly it makes perfect sence to me, although imao carrier drones should be about at long-range as dread's main guns (~150km)"

9/26/2009,"i'm not against scams. removing scams would be very tricky. after all, for one man a shuttle priced at 8mil is a scam, but to the next one it's a blessing. if it's the only shuttle in a 15j radius, then i'd rather pay for that shuttle than risk my implants with no defence what so ever.but yes, the constant spam of it, and the amount of obvious scam contracts. i now have to scour through a list of 50 contracts when i'm looking to buy something. it makes it very hard to look for a good price, and that's why i tend to avoid the contract system as a whole these days.but no, removing scams is not the answer. like i mentioned, it's hard to define what a scam is. and removing the ability to rename contracts won't solve much either. after all, adding the text to contract prices didn't stop the spammage. there is no easy answer i'm afraid. i guess i'll just minimize buy dealings with the contracts sytem. it's simple, and it works."
9/26/2009,are there no kind of dissolution triggers?broken system waiting for the day it breaks?
9/26/2009,"i take your point, but as much as representatives have an obligation to represent people who didn't vote for them, they're not on the council because of constituents who supported other candidates. they're on the council because a sufficiently large number of people(~1000) decided that they liked them as a candidate, and wanted them to advance a particular agenda to ccp. for example, if 5% of players want a moddable ui, 95% don't, and the 5% had elected me to the csm last term, i would be perfectly justified in ignoring the 95% and continuing to advance my principles, because that was the platform i ran on. the other eight could and would say i was crazy, but that wouldn't change my position, nor would it change my responsibility to advocate for it. ultimately, a recall vote is justified on the grounds that while the representative might have been supported by a plurality when the election happened, later developments destroyed that support, making them no longer a valid representative of the populace's opinions. with a voting system like the csm's, how can you possibly tell when this had happened? there were about 30k votes cast, and meissa won 9th place with 1132 votes. can you envision any sort of petition system that could reliably tell you whether the 4% who voted for a given candidate had lost faith in that candidate's ability to represent their views, versus just having annoyed the other 96%? it'd be like saying that because you should be able to recall your own mp, you should also be able to recall somebody else's. not to mention the procedural difficulties - you'd basically have to re-elect the entire council from scratch to recall one member, or else the replacement will always be a goon. i can't imagine canceling the whole csm for a month, out of a six-month term, to maybe replace one member, is worth it at all. as for voter turnout, we live in a world where half of all eligible voters choose not to cast a ballot for who will be the most powerful man in the world. do you really think there's any circumstances whatsoever where we'll get high turnout for a player advisory council? if i had nine eve players as love slaves, i'd probably be more likely to support recall."
9/26/2009,"i had a weird thought for a new t3 ship class in eve: strategic command ship (scs)2 pilots required: main pilot runs the ship, second can only see a new/advanced tactical overlay, and requires fleet admiral role (fa, should it require ""fleet command v"" ?), showing all fleet members, regardless of which system they are in. fa skill could determine number of jumps away, 1 or 2 jumps per level.the fa should have the ability to set warp in points for fleet ships within a certain range, control scanning drones to pinpoint the enemy positions, and basically responsible for planning and controlling the battle.high enough skills and the fa can link to another strategic command ship (0-5 jumps away?) and incorporate that ones sensor data into it's own overview, so if the fleet have more of these, they get better overall sensor coverage.an scs should have no weapons, only mounting gang links and perhaps a few drones, it is the fleets job of keeping it safe. it should have a thick hide though, and a relatively high warp strength. a tough one to crack, but not impossible.being t3 it could be modular as well, tailoring it for specific types of combat, or better modules for larger engagements, say maximum number of tracked targets. instead of the offensive section on the strategic cruiser, it could be a scic (strategic combat information centre) section. the scs could then have the following 5 t3 sections: defensive, electronic, engineering, scic, and propulsion systems.the scic determines the number of simultaneous tracks, friends and enemies combined, as well as if the scs can exchange tracking data with another scs in the fleet, including from another system if the module is advanced enough, and the fa have sufficient skills for it.insane idea, or could it be viable ?"
9/26/2009,"this is more of a ideas forum thread.the inclusion of a new t3 ship with sophisticated interfacing concludes that a lot of programming will be required by ccp staff. usually features such as this will always be required to go through several phases and none of which deal with csm. look up patch notes under eve insider.that said, i don't support this because of all the topics that csm could fix that are likely to receive a fix, this is not."
9/26/2009,"since ccp will probably never be able to solve the problem of dreadnoughts and other slow moving ships bumping each other off their sentries, i propose that a change be made to allow sentry drones to move when they've been recalled to a ship's drone bay. to curb abuse (ie, using the 'return to drone bay to cause sentries to move closer to the ship, only to tell them to engage a target before they're done), they could be set so that, once they're told to return, they won't respond to further orders until they're back in the drone bay."
9/26/2009,"i like the principle, but i'm not sure if your solution is workable. still, worth asking ccp for, see if they have any better ideas."
9/26/2009,i endorse the idea of one-time-use rockets being fitted to sentries when being launched for the purpose of better recovery.
9/26/2009,"i like the idea, but it will make the sentry mongers life too easy.now:drop sentries, move away to safety. enemy can move close to or kill sentries to mitigate damage.sentries are lost unless you win or risk your ship in recovery operation.then:drop sentries, move away to safety. enemy can move close to or kill sentries to mitigate damage.move sentries to apply damage once more without ever getting in danger yourself, orrecover sentries and bugger off without ever endangering yourself, or sentries are lost unless you win or risk your ship in recovery operation.it will function as a way to partially bypass the restrictions set by dronebay size, making balancing even more of a chore.make the recall order non-revocable, balance by tweaking speed and it might work, would still make sentry life far too easy for my liking but not as easy as ability to move them."
9/26/2009,"i would agree with you if sentry drones would be massively more powerful then ordinary drones, but they aren't. so i support this thread."
9/26/2009,force them to only move at 50ms and you have a deal.
9/26/2009,"yes, allow them to move... just move slowly. this will allow you to recover them after your fleet has nudged you out of position or they've somehow ended up inside the shield of an enemy pos. another limitation of recovering slow boat sentry drones... while they're returning they are not shooting.currently they do move... at like 1m/s or so, but they still shoot while doing so."
9/26/2009,"i'm sure ccp has answers to most of these questions, and i'm equally sure it's too late in the process for the csm to make much difference now, given that a lot of the answers you want will probably get released a week from now."
9/26/2009,if you start nerfing the control towers of those that don't hold sov all you would achieve is a mad dash for sov after the patch and then make it a hell of a lot harder for smaller alliances to secure a foothold in a system while going for sov and kicking out the incumbants.can't support as it will just reinforce the 0.0 status quo

9/27/2009,whatever you say lemming... i prefer to live in the land of reality... not tin foil hats and paranoia.if that makes me an idiot in your eyes... i dare say i'm pretty well off.so keep on yelling chicken little... i'm quite sure you'll find more bits of sky on the ground.there well always be an amount of risk in any game/application/website wherever we go.i choose no to spaz out like some teenager... if there was a problem i'm pretty damn sure ccp would not be doing so bloody well in business... after-all your still playing aren't you?
9/27/2009,"the performance of a company is subject to many variables which can be so easily manipulated by management and poor controls. unless your in a vital position overseeing ccp you wouldn't know whether the business is doing well. this supports that you aren't all there.risk only occurs in life when the outcome of events are uncertain, with perfect information there would be no risk. the lack of disclosure means you know less and therefore the amount of risk you accept is greater. simple logic, thanks for confirming my point.lastly, i'd like to point out the recent events with the collapse of some companies. now if you weren't trolling the forums so much drake maybe you would know that the public has demanded a push for greater security in business. namely to do with disclosing more information so that we can make more informed decisions about whether the company in general is likely to go bust. with that said, how often has a push been made by the public for less disclosure?this means anyone who reads this post will either be:(a) ill-informed about the purpose of disclosing information, possibly because of people like yourself for giving no justification for not supporting it and trolling forums(b) support this thread because they know that, in the long term, having more disclosure will mean better outcomes in all future events(c) don't support this because it leads to you or your friends having to change something with eve data which can only be changed by ccp employees. thus you need a connection to ccp to be in this category. why? pick up a few articles about employee research and you'll have your answer...hence why i support this thread and why csm should bring this to ccp's attention."
9/27/2009,there's a glaring problem with your so called logic chicken little.1: csm is not on ccp's payroll... ccp can say no or its none of there concern and your still going to throw a damned fit.2: your assuming you have the capacity and the foresight to understand or know the details... and to be capable of judging them as a result... so you know... what the hell are you going to do about it? emo-rant some more? complain some more? to what end? what are you going to accomplish aside from more crying and whining over someone's stupid mistake that ccp has made efforts to fix?like i said.... if it was that bad... people would leave the game.again... your still here.. so i guess its not that big of a problem.now go get your tin foil hat and run along : o pbecause like it or not... ccp runs the show... not us... making silly demands like this is a waste of time.wan't to get there attention? unsub and get others to do the same... then you'll get there attention.csm won't bother with this... they may mention something but full disclosure? please... lets come back to reality.

9/27/2009,"alternativly, plex could be used for the 30days or face change or character transfer."
9/27/2009,i really don't see any reason why everything that involves currency shouldn't be done in-game.
9/27/2009,nice idea.
9/27/2009,excellent idea. thumbs up./ben
9/27/2009,sounds good
9/27/2009,"yes, yes, yes. you have to wait for the end of the cycle for it to actually overload, but you do want to make sure that you have activated overload for the next cycle."
9/27/2009,"rework of the overheating interface is sorely needed, small buttons and clashing colours.also, why does a module deactivate overload when i deactivate module .. give us an option to have a proper toggle."
9/27/2009,ahem.
9/27/2009,"exactly, strpr.. more then just your local friendly roaming gank fest.. we really think about it too!if active local tanking is to be more useful in pvp the wider issues need to be looked at, until then we will all keep sheild buffering small ships with logistics in support and armour tanking rring battleships.there are a number of ways this can be fixed, like resists being improved during module activation (it boosts more then hps perhaps for higher energy cost). looking at fitting costs. looking at glaring disparities between armour and shield tanking (difference is good.. making it utterly fail on ships designed for that task is not). so this proposal, i don't agree with but i agree there is a general problem which makes fitting quite inflexable and fitting some ships in a way that uses active tank bonuses pretty much a bad idea, that is unless you fail fit."
9/27/2009,"full support! furthermore, active tanking requires far more attention from the pilot than a passive tank and should be boosted accordingly."
9/27/2009,"hmm, this doesnt solve the core problem of active tanking, being that the active tank will fold in no time when more than one hostile is shooting it.having said that, i personally dont miss active tanks at all, as it did only favor a few select ships to begin with.besides it does still seem to work pretty well on the ships designed for it anyway, at least in those situations that favor active tanking over a buffer."
9/27/2009,"preety much.the problem is that boosting active tanking significantly is a complete nerf to anything solo. most ships being buffered with a few notable exceptions (largely, tank bonused ships) makes for a far more solo friendly environment.the few things i see as silly regarding active tanks:- the fact you can't run even a single rep on a pvp ship without cap boosting, and doing it often- fitting requirements a little steep - particularly cpu on shield boostersoverall, not supported."
9/27/2009,"new players need a jump start with sp. for example 5 - 10 mil sp that can be assigned any way they want. this would be for new accounts only, 1 character only, and they could pay a premium to ccp. for example, if 5mil sp = 3 months training time, then the cost would be a 3 month membership premium.background: we had a group of 5 people all started playing eve a couple of months ago. 2 have already dropped out. one has been playing wow while waiting for sp to train. myself and the other person, have concluded that we will just sit at space station for the next 6 months or so while we train.now, before you get your knickers in a knot, it doesn't matter if this is ""right"" or ""wrong"" - this is what has happened.it doesn't do ccp any good to advertise on tv for new players, when they already have new players that quit due to unrealistic new player limitations. it also doesn't do ccp or eve any good because i won't recommend it to new people because it takes too long to get started.all the shortcuts to speed up training, such as buying characters, learning books, implants, etc. to help this, realistically only benefit long term players. for a new character such as myself, the learning books alone takes 2 months to train - with implants.in the end, ccp is losing money by losing players. i would like to see ccp make money so that we get better servers, less lag, a better game = more players."
9/27/2009,1. may i suggest watching
9/27/2009,"six months in station? you're doing it horrifically wrong. a new player who starts working his way up the mission chain can be doing l4s inside of two months, with the appropriate standings, skills, and cash, with no real difficulty. a newbie miner can be in a retriever in two weeks and a hulk in eight. an industrialist can be pumping out ammo after a day, and have perfect t1 skills in 2-3 weeks. a pvper can score kills with maybe six hours of training, and a trader doesn't even require that much. just what are you trying to do that you need several million free sp? also, i find it hilarious that someone would complain about not starting off as an effective character in a mmo, and his refuge would be a traditional grindfest rpg where you spend your first week killing swamp rats. or did your wow-playing buddy get his level 80 by sitting in the newbie town waiting for free xp to roll in after he made his character?"
9/27/2009,"/not signed. we already have a 100% training speed boost for new characters, i think that's more than enough!on top of that, noobs get two remaps for their attributes... which is very good for reducing training times even further if you get it right.the only gripe i have at the present is those damned learning skills. i've just finished training the main ones to five and will soon start on the second set. spending over a month just training learning skills sucks in my opinion, it would be nice to have them removed from the game and have the skill points allocatable to other skills, or give them to everyone at level iv (for the first set) when you create a character... reducing training time spent on them. the only problem with that is you get the folks with 100mil+ skill points moaning because they spent the time training them so we all have to suffer too."
9/27/2009,guide ot faster training: 1: remap for max attributes to learning2: get learning to 53: get all other learning skills to 44: remap to balance out attributes (except charisma)5: profit
9/27/2009,"your group is a fail.i enjoyed the game so much when i started that you cannot even imagine.it was wonderful exploring the game, discovering things, meeting people and growing and dreaming."
9/27/2009,"this. no support. it's already much easier on new pilots than it used to be, and i think the new pilots are losing out by having a less challenging experience."
9/27/2009,hah...no!
9/27/2009,"no, they really don't."
9/27/2009,"i know at least four people who joined eve in the last few months and were running l4s as a corp activity within 3 or so weeks, as well as pvping. you're wrong, newbies don't need more sp. they need people who don't tell them they're useless until they have <x> million sp."
9/27/2009,this is not the game for you. quit now.
9/27/2009,"i think this summarizes you pretty well.also patience!ps. not supported, you can do tons of stuff with no sp whatsoever."
9/27/2009,cause you noob you special ?
9/27/2009,"i survived with 800k sp to start, no speed bonus, i lasted a year, i got 10m sp, and no friggin noob is getting a years worth of sp because he's new. plus they wouldn't know what to do with it.ps: join a corp, then you won't sit in a station./not signed."
9/27/2009,800k!! you lucky git.. i started with 65k sp and before anyone told me about learning skills i was at 1m sp ;>
9/27/2009,"coming from a corp that's been wardec'd for the simple fact that the other corp assumed we were weak. i can see the frustration in the current system. however, i do not see any reason to make changes to the ability to wardec as is. i think as a way for industrial corps to counter frivilous wardec's is to implement a merc system. similar to how the bounties work. where there is an in game market for merc corps for hire. you can place your bids/targets and corps can pick up the ""contracts"" in game. and after war is declared and fufilled they will be paid. this way if someone is grieving you. you have the ability to hire an army."
9/27/2009,"good idea about concord, perhaps paying for the privelage of being in the highest sec space...but as to the rest of the post, this is a post about wardecc mechanics, not personal preferences, i have fought wars, and so on, alot of pvp. but this post is about an ingame mechanic that is abused easily. the reason i proposed this is that i hear alot about why war is broken, but see almost no proposals about what to do about it.war is a great part of this game, and there should always be ways of going to war, but it shouldnt be a way fro griefers to legalise piracy in hisec.and no, i dont think your a griefer for disagreeing with me, the only people i think are griefers are the ones who go all emorage at me becasue this mechanic would limit their ability to shoot at defenceless people."
9/27/2009,"this is a harsh game,you consent to pvp the moment you undock.wardecs can be a pain, but if you are smart you can prepare for them.frigates are cheap, as are the mods to fit them effectively and pvp with smaller ships is a lot of fun.so stop complaining, start grouping up, and start standing up for yourself!the only thing that may need adjusting is the war dec system for corps, as prices haven't been adjusted since the game was started afaik, (unlike for alliances).so in short, not supported, learn to watch local, learn to play smart and above all, learn to have fun!"
9/27/2009,"when republic fleet xl ammo was removed in revelations 2.2, ccp greyscale confirmed it was for ""balance issues."" now that faction xl ammo has reached a point of saturation, where any well-funded capital force can readily make it available, i believe it is time to resurrect navy xl ammo.however, i propose that the damages be shifted. seeing as empire navy xl ammo will be easier to acquire, the current 10% damage bonus now granted ""low-grade"" pirate ammo should be attached to it, while said low-grade pirate xl ammo should be boosted to the 15% level, as it's understandably harder to acquire and transport, given it can only be earned and redeemed in 0.0.this change would grant dreadnoughts and soon-to-be-less-useful pos higher damages to help them stand a chance against the massive amounts of hp supercarriers and titans will possess, as well as give more incentive to acquire xl ammunition of both grades, and serve to lower costs of both.all this being said, i do not believe high-grade pirate ammo should be offered, as a 20% damage boost to capitals would probably be too much."
9/27/2009,can't really see any flaws in that
9/27/2009,i would love to accidentally jump into a system that has system wide shock waves that do around 5k damage every couple of minuts ;) or one that slowly overheats your modules over the course of time. or caused effects simaller to the paranoia of certain drug boosters. stuff like that would be hilarious! you could even have one loaded with the best ore's but nullifies mining mods lol. or one that catastrophicly tries to bond any two things that get to close to eachother together ending in a beutifull explosion. hahaha i like it (the original post) it gives the game more depth.
9/27/2009,come on. delve is safe! just goonies there!
9/27/2009,"it's not even a good mission for those with rorquals and jump freighters, because of the need for 2 manual cynos.in addition, i'll point out that blood raiders lack a level 4 q20 station based agent, which is something all other pirate factions have. actually, all other pirate factions have multiple l4 q20 agents, which in some cases share the same station."
9/27/2009,"that is pretty bad, but cannot compare to the raw existential dread experienced on getting materials for the war preparation from your pirate storyline agent. just where the f*** are you supposed to get 6000 m^3 of omber/kernite/whatever in the middle of 0.0?the fact that you then get sod all in terms of faction standing gain/isk because the same mission can be completed in five seconds with no effort in empire is galling to say the least."
9/27/2009,"can i point to the uproar your alliance would have started if those agents were added when delve was controlled by bob/kenzoku?mining it or getting someone to mine it?there are a few mission (storyline or not) that are hardly good in 0.0 but unless ccp decide to revamp missions in general and give a larger range of pve content with missions and storylines more focused on the different factions/corporations than today i see little possibility for a change.and ccp don't seem interested in spending the manpower needed to revamp all the pve content. still, in hope of better pve content, supported."
9/27/2009,"we would have probably complained yes, but i think our alliance has been pretty vocal how delve space is ridiculously broken as far as truesec/faction/officer spawns. with the coming system/moon changes, and ccp relooking at pirate faction ships the mission changes should be a no brainer.as for the mining, i have no problem with it at all as most everyone has some basic mining skills and the volumes aren't really that bad. if 0.0 pirate missioning takes off, the market will address this."
9/27/2009,"asking for a boost to a race is about as generalistic as it gets.yeah i allready told someone the ""lol no one supports you"" tactic isnt gonna work on me. you know whats changed between then and now ?nothing.its not my personal opinion. my personal opinion never included amarr needing a boost.but hey the data indicates what it indicates. i just presented the facts of the statistical analysis and noted that all the best ships were gallente / minmatar.if you think i made it up you can allways go verify the results by doing it yourself."
9/27/2009,"well its not written anywhere that every post on the boards has to be about a specific boost/nerf to a specifc item.i'm only really interested in creating a level playing field between the races, so that people have more options for pvp.having gallente/minmatar as supperior races for solo/small gang pvp means people have fewer ships and setup to choose from.how many amarr frigates and cruisers are any good for solo work for instance ? , i know a lot of them suck because they dont have enough mids to fit propulsion and tackle.caldari suck at solo on the other hand because mostly they cant tank and tackle at the same time and have big issues fitting cap injectors in an environment where neuts seem to be everywhere.the lauded superiority of caldari for fleet work is nothing more than a myth. shield transfers are impossible to fit and fire into weeker resists than there armor repping cousins, missile damage is week and often arrives to late ( in very large fleet ) on primary to do any significant damage verus guns.oh wait i nearly forgot, caldari have ecm , well theres a great option for me to enjoy my fleet pvp in i can go out and get myself blown up.all i'm looking to achive in this thread is show which races need the most attention.i hope i can get some constructive critism at some point and maybe gasp! even some help in improving the analysis.but before that happens this post has to get through the negatron / idiot poster / knee jerk reaction phase.if i have to defend it solo for years before it reaches the positive feedback stage so be it."
9/27/2009,"you already got that criticism, but refused to even waste a single thought on how to improve your analysis.numerous people including myself pointed out where your analysis falls short, but you arent trying to pick up on that, the only thing you are doing is trying to discuss away the obvious."
9/27/2009,"honestly, just dig up few major alliance killboards for a far better picture of what is actually being used. tons of apocs and armageddons and such ships are used in major fighting all over tranquility.and suggesting blackbird < bellicose because people don<U+FFFD>t shoot bellicoses first...i actually agree with you that omen and maller are sort of sucky but statistics are not needed to know that. and rockets are terrible."
9/27/2009,"ok, your personal opinion that caldari need a boost has been noted.""facts of the statistical analysis"" is a misleading statement.your methodology is invalid for proving anything. that is a fact - since a metric which can but does not have to indicate that a ship really did perform better in a gang (as indicated by example given) is not admissible for anything labeled as ""fact"" or ""proof"". the problem is that your criteria are not universally valid - the fact that your efficiency metric can score a ship well while real gang efficiency is low, and vice versa, means that your post - and let us for a moment pretend that your sampling is somehow valid - fails to provide proof that ships scored low by you are indeed inefficient. you only rely on speculation that ""scenarios where my metric is invalid are rare"" - once we have firmly established that such scenarios are possible, only a detailed analysis of how common they are statistically and factoring that in could give some credibility to your study. assuming your sample selection criteria are valid in the first place (where we have shown problems with them already).therefore, this post, while it does contain a statistical analysis, does not contain a statistical analysis which proves there is a lack of ship balance in regards to caldari vs the rest. without proof, your post remains a expression of your personal opinion. this has been noted already."
9/27/2009,supporting ui improvements since 2003.
9/27/2009,"i'm aware - there's a reason i supported it anyways. just saying, is all"
9/27/2009,i have read several threads concerning the problems with local chat and i have a solution that may address one aspect of this issue.remove ships that have an activated stealth module from the local chat user list (they will still be able to chat in local and observe it for what it is worth though).most of the stealth pilots seem to think that the user list this gives away their presence and goes against the idea of being stealthy.this proposal would preserve local chat but make stealth more of a functional tool for observing people for various reasons whilst remaining unseen.
9/27/2009,i agree
9/27/2009,"you want to boost cloaking? it<U+FFFD>s not like there isn<U+FFFD>t enough of sb/recon gangs around already. would be really nice to chill in a system, nobody could find you, nobody would even know you<U+FFFD>re around. i think everyone would fit a cloak them."
9/27/2009,"yeah exactly. cloaking is already a huge advantage--esp. cov ops cloaking. i might come around to this idea, however, if there was also a mechanic implemented that required cloaks to be occasionally refreshed somehow so that pilots couldn't afk cloak for long periods--say, more than an hour or something--without their cloaks turning off and having to be re-activated manually."
9/27/2009,"100% love the idea of multiple monitor support by being able to ""undock"" various windows from the main client window and move them into other monitor spaces. would be awesome."
9/27/2009,"gate guns really aren't that hard to tank. adjust your setups? it's ""low security"", not ""null security"" - if you want completely unsecured space, there's really quite a lot of it for you to go play in. there are some tweaks i'd support, but outright removal? no."
9/27/2009,"the ""security"" in lowsec is already a joke. if you want to gank without built-in consequences, that's what 0.0 is for."
9/27/2009,i agree. we should get rid of the gate guns. they are these unchanging fun killers.instead concord navy spawns similar but weaker to that of the faction navy spawns in highsec. also with the sleeper target changing iq.much better that way.this way the tank ships can tank just as they ought to. the speed ships can speed tank. drones arent being destroyed right away anyway :)it also provides safety for those not at gates. which promotes people actually doing things in low sec.
9/27/2009,"an awful proposal with underlying themes of selfishness. how about instead of removing low sec gate guns, why don't you go get better."
9/27/2009,"two things take place in low-sec:1. ganks. in that case the point is not to obtain a fair fight, it's to get a nice km or loot. ganking indies at gates or stations comes under this category.it's entirely fair that it should require a fair amount of power (ie sentry tanking ability) to gank stuff, otherwise ganking would be too easy and people subject to ganking would avoid low-sec at all costs.2. ""real"" fightsdubbing them real because they involve a conscious decision on the player to warp to an asteroid belt, looking for a fight.this is when a variety of people wishing to fight meet up at amamake iii - 1 asteroid belt and slug it out.if you're looking for the first (which is what your post suggests), you can't possibly be saying ""i'd like my t1 frigate to be able to gatecamp industrials"".if you're looking for the second, sentries don't matter. either you're fighting in belts, in which case sentries aren't there, or you're getting gatecamped, in which case on the contrary, they can help slant things your way when you're getting gatecamped, which makes for a fairer fight."
9/27/2009,what? it's not enough to be allowed to kill anyone on sight but now you want it to be even easier?sheesh... man up! get a bloody backbone.i hear people tank gate guns all the time.not supported!
9/27/2009,"got to say, im really quite glad you didnt join sons of 0din after all...a day into piracy and already moaning how hard it is. piracy is hard. it is supposed to be hard. we arnt fluffy, comedy one eyed chaps with jolly pirate nicknames, we are hated and feared, and rightfully so.we are pirates because it is hard, because if it isnt a challenge, it isnt worth doing. go and run missions, you wont have to worry about gate guns there..."
9/27/2009,"gate-guns really should not have infinite tracking too, that bit really hurts new players the most..."
9/27/2009,"that's it. ninja salvagers should draw aggro even if they do not loot from the can.i checked through the assembly hall, but by page three did not see that anyone else had posted regarding this issue. apologies if i missed."
9/27/2009,"what a great idea! now, i'll have yet another way to get a flag onto carebears!supported. it'll significantly increase chances for gankage."
9/27/2009,i agree we need moar ways to kill mission runners
9/27/2009,"how about this? in ""low sec"" they show a number at the top for how many people are there...and replace all individuals with just 1 corp logo and ticker per corp present? this way you can see how many people are afoot in ""low sec"". and what corporations they ""might"" be from but would have to find them to know for sure.and in ""o.o"" change it so you can just see corp logo's and tickers but no numbers at the top? this would let you know wheather or not the system was empty also would let you know if your wt's are hiding there or if you should move on but, not which ones or how many.in ""wh"" space keep it like it is...blank unless you talk in it.and last but not least in ""high sec""...group all members from the same corp present in the system together under their corp logo and tickers. so there is numbers at the top and listed on the ticker for each corp so when u left click it opens that corp and u see and can click on all the people from that corp that are present in the current system grouped together and when you r click it gives you the corp/alliance info. this would clean up ""high sec"" local and make scanning local easier in say high traffic areas and on top of that it would be much better public exposure for corporations.with this idea, when people talk in local the talker's char name would still show up in the chatbox same as it does now. just the listing on the right hand side would be affected by this change..we wouldnt want to make life hard on spammers and we dont want to ruin the actuall friendly interaction of people just trying to have friendly conversation's either ;) i think this idea would help everyone even the miners with or withought the scanner nerf. it's ussually somone with probes that you really need to worry about as for miners they will just rush the belts anyway...so all together cloakers get a bonus, miners get to keep their run for the hillz local, and fleets will know if targets are present so they can begin to scan for them. its local streamlined.(just a clarification with this setup any individual can still talk in any local at the additional risk of becoming visible and linkable in the left hand chat box) comments?"
9/27/2009,it doesn't matter how many alts you use to propose the same awful idea. removing local is still not going to happen.
9/27/2009,im not an alt and i didnt say anything about getting rid of local..did you even bother reading it? try reading it again. slower this time so you can try to grasp the concept of streamlined and not removed.comments?
9/27/2009,"1) paragraphs. capital letters. use them. 2) this is not a text message being sent to a 14 year old girl. ""u"" is not a word. 3) corp sorting as a way of cleaning it up a little in highsec, and narrowing down information as sec status drops, is one of the more interesting proposals i've seen for dealing with this problem, and it at least avoids most of the usual pitfalls of the ""nerf local!"" whiners. that said, it still doesn't feel right to me. local is at root a chat channel, for all that it's morphed into an intel source in practice. corporations don't chat. it makes decent sense, but it's just not meshing in my mind. sorry."

9/27/2009,"how about this?in low sec you see the number of players in system, and the corp logo and ticker of all corps that have at least one player there. you can therefore see how many people are afoot, and what corporations they might be in, but not specifically who is there and what corporation they belong to.in 0.0, same as above but without total numbers.in wh space do not change anything.in high sec local is the same as it is now, except characters are grouped by corp. just a way of streamlining it, making it easier to identify particular corp members without having to set standings and scroll through the list.fixed for you. i only support the high sec change."

9/27/2009,"not everyone is english native speaker. that said using a spell checker is still a good thing. not supported, it is interesting as an option to sort your local, that everyone could choose for himself- according to alliance or whatnot, but the idea of just having that just does not feel right to me.. it is just weired."
9/27/2009,"not supported because if people don't have enough pride in their ideas to present them in an easily readable fashion, then i don't have the time to wade through a wall of text."
9/27/2009,"max, there's a fairly obvious difference between someone who is bad with the language because they're not fully fluent(poor word choices, weird tenses, etc.), and someone who is bad with the language because they don't care(lack of spacing/punctuation/capitalization, txtspk, etc.). i don't criticize the former group, because they're infinitely better at english than i am at their language, but i do occasionally criticize the latter group, especially when their awful writing style impairs my ability to read what they're trying to say. to be fair to the op, half that difficulty was probably caused by me being on the forums at 2:40 am, but judging by the chorus that followed me, i'm not alone in finding it hard to read. chopper, while i was kind of a jerk, i'm not just trying to correct you for my own sake. you'll do far better in your efforts to convince people that your suggestions are good ones if they can read what you're suggesting without getting a headache. there's a reason we standardized languages, and it's to allow for ease of communication. the better you conform to the language that the rest of us know, the better your ideas will be conveyed to us. since you're trying to convince us of your ideas, you might want to pay attention to that fact. as for the idea itself, i think my opposition rests on the fact that chat channels are at least theoretically designed to help people chat. i don't want to talk to random goon #374, i want to talk to that guy who was smacking in local five minutes ago. your system works very nicely, as long as nobody actually talks. when they do, what happens? do they show up on the channel list? if so, do they disappear when they leave system? there's a couple other similar problems, but that's the most obvious. you're trying to describe a more reasonable solution for a ""system intel"" window, based on current mechanics, and at that goal you've done a good job. but that's not local chat. if you were to make local delayed and voluntary, and then add this as a separate window, i think i could actually support that. but if you're going to be making a proper intel channel, then you need to sever the absurd link between local and intel. ultimately, i think i like the idea, and just dislike the way you're proposing to implement it. as such, i suppose i do support this after all."
9/27/2009,"your in a corp, alliance or whatever your in a fleet. your the boss so you want to get people fleet up. to make your job easier, you use the fleet invite feature. you display it (spam it) in corp or local chat. very easy and good way to do it.problem is when your in faction warfare, you can't. all because its an npc corp.sure, its a small problem probably theres more priorities going on but still an annoyance that i can't fleet invite.so if corp can, i want it too."
9/27/2009,"so you cant do fleet invitation(alliance) with fail warfare? that's unusual. should be fixed.might as well call it ""fleet invitation(militia)"" while they are fixing it."
9/27/2009,"already coming, check the fleet finder on sisi. ... hmm it might not be coming."
9/27/2009,i know the fleet finder is supposed to fix this but it probably won't come out for a while. fleet invite (militia) would be nice.
9/27/2009,"my suggestion for an improvement is something that would be a minor change, and the only real people who i think would disagree would be those who wish to exploit the corp mechanics. i propose that pvp between corp mates in high-sec must be verified by some form of flag mechanic. so that the battle between both parties is consensual. now let me give you an expample of why. it was days after our corp was formed. when we had a new applicant. he seemed okay, nothing horrible about his past that we noticed at first. he claimed to speak poor english and thus did not get into comm's. we let him join and ran missions with him for a few days. he seemed fine. until one day when a couple of the guys were on a mission alone. he drops fleet and starts shooting at one of them. the fight would have been fair except he had 2 logistic ships warp in on him and begin remote rep's. because he was in our corp the game did not flag them as aggressive. essentially there was nothing they could do but get destroyed. now, i understand eve is a harsh place, and the game mechanics allowed for this to happen so there is not much anyone can do except be even more precautious of new members. but it does not have to be this way. a simple pvp-flag could prevent a lot of potential grievers."
9/27/2009,"what... your saying this guy attacked you in high sec? he would have gotten his arse owned by concord, a couple of logistics ships wouldn't have saved him. even if your in the same corp, i don't think that allows him to shoot at you even in high sec without concord showing up. if he attacked you in low sec... then to be honest your fair game.this smells a bit too much of wow pve servers for my liking. if you didn't, check their api in future and keep a close eye on them.as it stands... i can't support this idea."
9/27/2009,"boo on pvp flagging. if your corp is killing you against your will, leave them and join a good corp. if you have spies infiltrate you and cost you a ship or two, you got off easy. let me repeat that, you should be on your knees and giving thanks to the all mighty, that he was stupid enough to give himself away so easily. with a flagging system the bastard would have just waited until he got access to the good stuff. in worst case scenario he could have robbed the corp blind and caused it to collapse.also it seems that making changes to how neutral repping in highsec works, would be a better solution to the issue.edit: attacking another player or their stuff who is in the same player corporation as you, does not cause a concord response."
9/27/2009,be more careful about who you recruit.
9/27/2009,by clicking undock you agree to have a permanent pvp flag on your ship. deal with it or gb2wow
9/27/2009,"very much support streamlining the contract process by removing some of the dumb / poorly designed ""interruptions"". with regard to damaged mods, my preference would be to be given two options:repair and continue? (which would take the cost from my wallet)remove damaged items and continue? the interruption of the contract process by damaged mods is one of the most annoying and unnecessary features in the game, especially when you're trying to contract scores or hundreds of items in remote stations to someone else. get rid of it."
9/27/2009,"very simple. if a close my corp then i should have the ability to destroy, delete or remove the shares scattered around. especially the ones i gave to people.for now, i can't and nobody can't. after talking to a gm, they can't either as they don't have the access to do it. thats very weird ?but anyway, i would like to have an option to destroy the shares i have if the corp is destroyed."
9/27/2009,shares are shares of ownership.... rationally speaking no one can destroy a corporation they don't completely own.the only sensible thing to do is to make sure that the ceo has a majority stake so he has the power to do such things.furthermore the ability to buy back shares without resistance would also help quite a bit.shares in general are messed up in a number of areas... so your idea is not the best... but your problem is quite valid.
9/27/2009,"thats the problem. for example. i closed my old corp but created around 1m shares. after i closed my corp i just remembered about the shares that were given to me and some other people. since the corp is closed, its useless to keep those shares, they got no value. so at the point i wanted to destroy them but i can't. the game doesn't allow me to do it and not even ccp for now."
9/27/2009,"i'd support the ability for a player to delete shares they own of corporations, or maybe just closed corporations. no support for other people deleting my shares of closed corps(whether automatically or manually) - if i want to keep a memento, i ought to be allowed to."
9/27/2009,yep... which is why i refuse to use them.... stupid little things like that get down right annoying.shares are useful in marketing and trading... but tend to be problematic.
9/27/2009,"i wish the forum had a more advanced filter option.i.e. character market > would be nice to to have the option to filter different characters, character types (pvp/industry), filter asking prices and skill pointsyeah i know there's far more important stuff that needs doing but yeah it would be nice."
9/27/2009,"to the contrary, i think whs on average should stay open for a shorter period of time. max 12 hours would suit me fine. having lived in a wh for a few weeks, i suggest that whs being open longer than they stay open now would be annoyingly tedious."
9/27/2009,"actually, i think the transit type wormholes, i.e. the ones that connect lowsec-lowsec, lowsec-nullsec or nullsec-nullsec for example should really stay open for a longer time."
9/27/2009,"i think this was already proposed and i ain't gonna search 3 million pages in here so heres the proposal.to have ccp create a program , just like ventrilo, that we could use for voice support. pretty simple hey. of course, when you start the program and connect to a server then you could see some channels just like chat. those channels could be linked with your username so if your in a corp, the corp channel could pop up and same thing with the ""alliance"" channel. if your in fw, the corp, militia and other type of channels could pop up. when a fleet is created, the fleet channel would be created. simple as that.don't need to go in details but here are the ups/downs of itadvantageno need to rejoin fleet in case eve crash (happened to me yesterday)more channels since its ""dynamic"" and linked with your character name and your corporationcan't think of others for now but i don't see anything negative that ccp would say no to this.disadvantagelots of coding since this is a programresource from the computer. but since its so low these days, it wont be a big programsince its a program, ccp could develop a codec selection list for bandwith purposenot sure on this but since this would be a program, ccp might make people pay for it. if thats the case, i would buy it anyway.nothing wrong with the current eve voice right now but i feel its not enough. i would like to use a kind of program just like ventrilo or teamspeak. another better idea would be for ccp to look at the sdk of teamspeak 3 and create the program with it. i'm not the expert in coding but this i think would work well."
9/27/2009,not supported... vent's free as a client and there servers are cheap.ccp won't be doing any such things unless its conveniently in game or very very easy to implement.
9/27/2009,"sure vent is free. that i know. but its usually privately used. i would like to get in a voice program sometimes and meet people there not only the ones in my corp but also the ones probably in my region/constellation/solar system or even ones that wants to roam in my sector. that is 1 solution since lots of people will connect to it.how much time that happened to you when you wanted to pvp in a fleet but no one was there. or even when you wanted to roam but not enough people in your corp. i'm pretty sure theres at least 1 person in here that it happened. this ""voice"" program should help decrease this other disavantage.also when you say easy you wont have to type ip address, passwords and port numbers like ventrilo or teamspeak since its eve servers. you open it, you connect to it and thats it. choose your channel and boom. a good implementation would be to allow the user to create its on channel too."
9/27/2009,it's called eve voice... and its going to get overhauled rather soon...not supported.
9/27/2009,"what overhaul is that ? any details ? if not, your argument as no weight whatsoever.something tells me your not supporting because of the log on trap ? thats another disadvantage sure but lets face. ts and vent exist for that too."
9/27/2009,first off i'm an industrialist.secondly... making assumptions makes you look like an @$$.thirdly... its called the cosmo's (i think) project.. and if you had bothered to do your research you'd know that.ccp has indicated they plan to do a number of things to make life a little easier... as to when that takes place? is up to them.there is no reason to propose such a package becasue people already have vent and ts to use... adding another program is just that... one more choice... not earth shattering enough to be of any use atm.
9/27/2009,"heres what cosmos is from ""ccp caedmon"" from what i know, nothing in cosmos suggest anything about voice. and i wasn't at the fanfest so i don't know what was said exactly. when you say plans ? what plans ? for cosmos ? i answered that already. so yeah, i did my research. so again, whats the overhaul on voice you said again ? i'm still waiting for details.go on the pvp side of eve and you'll know that eve voice is not perfect, its far from it. most small fleets, fw, small corps uses ventrilo because its very easy to use and customize. but usually (not all of them i guess) uses teamspeak since the bandwith usage because of the low quality of the codecs. but it does take some expertise to tweak it in a way that its nearly perfect without a problem.like i said before, no problem with eve voice but its not perfect. bigger fleets is a mess with it. you crash, your done no more eve voice. you gotta get an invite again...if they accept it ofc.the reason for the ""package"" is valid because we already got eve voice integrated but its not the best tool for the voice comm. sure, its one more choice but thats with every product out there.p.s: i never made an assumptions...its called knowledge (most if not all that are not in pvp are not interested in this proposal)."
9/27/2009,"yes, that would be terribly handy."
9/27/2009,i'll bring this forward in a meeting. in fact i already spoke to a few ccp about this a few weeks ago when i was in iceland. i'll do it again during fanfest.
9/27/2009,this.and have shifts of gm monitoring all hubs and favorite chat channels.
9/27/2009,"its a pretty poor show but theres not a lot you can do about it im pretty sure nobody cares about the people posting in here. perhaps if the people who are complaining they want to raise points at fanfest were to actually complain vocally at fanfest, rather then backslapping each other, making beer jokes, comparing eve bum bags, at guffawing at awful gags in devs speeches perhaps something might be done for next time.to be fair though, in all probability (and gathering what we can from the various csm hints) there will be things in the responses to the issues brought up, which would ruing the ""suprise"" of the unveiling of other things at fanfest - and thus they want to keep it underwraps.skunk"
9/27/2009,"the aggressor has whatever grievance they decide is legitimate. now sometimes this is easy kills, but more often than not, there are actually reasons to go to war. if you smack me, and i decide to teach you a lesson about that, that is my prerogative. if you are undercutting me, and i trace the activity back to you, you are a legitimate target. if you are mining ore that i want, you are a legitimate target. if i want to put you under a wardec, to slow down your corp activity in empire, you are a legitimate target. this is by design, within the framework of eve. as long as the fee is paid, i see no reason to put some kind of limit on it based on activity. some groups have had mutual wardecs running for years, for rp reasons or whatever. this should now be artificially cut short, just because you don't want the conflict, is a pretty dumb idea. if you don't want to be decced, stay in an npc corp. its a good thing you guys don't work as game designers, because eve would have died ages ago if the continual whines about wardecs had ever been acted on."
9/27/2009,"term limits and helping to keep idiots from decloaking each other is more important to the csm than the issue that over 1200 people have signed? very well, on the order of term limits i vote that the current csm term ends immediately."
9/27/2009,"no, it is more like: ""we discussed the scanner issues with ccp when we saw them face-to-face a few weeks ago and they're aware of player unhappiness and are looking at revising the current restrictions."" people were spamming the scanner and it was producing quite a load on the servers. inserting the delay reduced this drastically."
9/27/2009,you guys wanna get your stories straight?
9/27/2009,"@vrikshaka : i do not see any substantial inconsistency in what my colleagues responded to that issue.the minutes of tonight's meeting are published on the evelopedia, and a raw log is available, too, as usual."
9/28/2009,"why should you have to spend isk on repairing them?? that doesn't make any sense i'm sorry, you don't see isk draining from your wallet when you rr drones so why in that situation?"
9/28/2009,you always have the option of remote repping your drones for free even with the drone repair bay however you can always dock up and repair them. similarly you always have the option of equipment armor/hull repair modules to repair your ship for free.not adding a cost to it would make the station service obsolete.
9/28/2009,"what about hull damage, unless i'm missing something you can't repair hull damage in space. the op stated that this feature would be invaluable if you were in hostile space without a station nearby... then you could repair damaged drones/fighters which had hull damage slowly over time.station repair services would still have a purpose... you won't be able to repair damaged modules with this will you ."
9/28/2009,"if you pray to your god maybe you can repair hull damage without a station, have you tried?the point is, station repair service to me seems to be becoming more and more obsolete. right now, it appears to only fix ""heat"" damage and those lazy pilots who don't purchase a armor/hull repairer (which costs about 1m+ repairs if you do it in station - anyone gonna fix that? for that price i want a full waxing and everyone on my ship!).that said, i don't want prices to be ridiculous like that but they shouldn't be free either. you incurred damage, do you think that when a projectile hits you your armor receives no mass loss? there'd be chunks in space. furthermore its a good way to make sure that a sizable chunk of isk that goes into the game also comes out."
9/28/2009,"for me it just seems a bit silly, its your ship... your fighters/drones, but you have to pay for them to be fixed? if they introduce hull repair systems then fine... but seeing that we don't i think it should just be ""free"". you incur shield damage, and it regenerates you don't have to pay for that lol. what your suggesting is a bit like this scene on a nimitz carrier... pilot - ""oh hey bob, thanks for fixing that f-18 for me"".deck chief - ""no problem, that will be $5000 please... i accept paypal and all major credit cards!"" a carrier relies on its fighters and drones being in tip top condition, having hull damage that can't be repaired however little does affect its combat performance. it makes complete logical sense to have this feature... hell, make it a trainable skill for carrier/super carrier pilots. say 5% increase to repair amount per minute of all fighters/drones in the hanger deck per level."
9/28/2009,supported.
9/28/2009,how about putting them in a bathtub with gel and hook their brains up to a computer?
9/28/2009,"i got used to it ... like you can get used to drive a car with a flat wheel. you may control it, but it just don't feel right."
9/28/2009,"of course, if ccp would give a crap about pvp"
9/28/2009,"same here. i don't like it but i do what i can. for once, you'll see more people using there heads when it comes to hunting lmao."
9/28/2009,"give them time to sort through all the alts posting support .this change almost only and exclusively affects ""pvpers"" that target defenceless belt ratters/miners in lo sec/0.0 which are already pretty scarce to begin with. and i'm using the term ""pvp"" losely here since pve fits have zero chance against pvp fits in combat.this change may actually bring a tiny bit of life back into the lo sec belts and you're having an emoragequit moment over it?ffs relax. go take your add and pimple control meds, go introduce yourselves to the sun, and give this change a chance for once."
9/28/2009,fix it pls
9/28/2009,hilmar: 'our goal of being a very transparent company'
9/28/2009,i support this proposal.
9/28/2009,i didn't even have to read past the topic to know i'd support this one. ingenius idea.
9/28/2009,genius at work here./support
9/28/2009,yes.
9/28/2009,"yes!don't they all cost the same amount as eachother anyway? so it shouldn't be that hard, to just implement an option on what you want to use your plex for once you buy it, or something like that, so it doesn't create 3 seperate markets, as the character sale + character portrait market would be dead in comparison to gtcsalso if i'm not mistaken, there is more supply than there is demand when it comes to gtc at the moment, so i guess that would help the situation"
9/28/2009,what you want is this:
9/28/2009,"uh, what? nos needs a buff, nothing can really use it anymore.alright, agree with this.i think lower pg was one of the suggestions.the rest of your post was pretty good points + stats, however even if this isn't a step in the exactly right direction, it's a great deal better than the current situation."
9/28/2009,"not sure why this hadnt happened way back. afterall since the nos nerf... it's practically useless outside missions.so pretty much anything that has less then oh say 2400 gj of cap pretty much better stay away from dodge? even in the current nos nerf state... 1200gj going into a capship's 100,000 cap. pretty much does nothing to raise the amount of cap they have or can use. instead their cap can be low enough that you are simply using the cap nos like neuts on subcaps.this i like. it means you can burn through your cap charges twice as fast... and some people might even overinject lots. it will also mean people might be able to get more gank out of their ships in very short term.already getting -50% reduction of stront and 300second cycles. more then enough.active tanking just isnt there. i see lots of good eve vids with active tanks... but in real pvp... active tanks just dont work. you die so quickly that u dont get rep cycles in. the extra 10% wont change much."
9/28/2009,"good idea! i've wanted a boost to pvp active-tanking for quite some time. nosses are somewhat useless now too. (i mean, the nos could be a good counter to neuts, but if you have the same ammounts of nosses on a ship as your enemy has neuts on his, ur most likely gonna loose the cap-fight. that doesnt make sense to me, as nosses are practically useless in most other situations)dunno much about the cap-stuff, but the other things are great :)"
9/28/2009,"active tank discussion is interesting but i think you should drop the nos thing, and the following chap makes clear the reason whythe nos is not the counter for having been neuted. that's what cap boosters are for. changing the nos to do double cap - or even the same cap as a neut would not help you in your situation.let's say we both have 100gj in our capacitors and i spend 20gj taking 20gj from you (yes i know in practice i take more but not enough more to alter the point i'm making here). you then fire your nos, and get... nothing. nada. bupkas. why? because we have the same cap. this is what the nos is for. it ensures that, all things being equal, you will never cap out whilst he has capacitor to give you, but it will not disadvantage him to help you, so even if you boost nos by 1000% you're still not helping yourself. all you're doing is making small ships that attack larger ones even more cap stable, and frankly, they should be more or less that anyway with the values as they are."
9/28/2009,i agree with all these proposed changes!
9/28/2009,"i would prefer sr t2 ammo to give positive tracking bonuses rather than more damage. even doing identical damage to t1 ammo would be good.on the minmatar chages, i think the 1650mm cannon needs something more. more range probably so that they can work with the 250km lr sniperfleets."
9/28/2009,"i quite like the falloff mechanic. seems a much more natural thing than the lasers' cliffside drop off in dps.we are discussing this in the test server feed back thread on navy ships and generally agree that a tempest should be changed from a +rof+damage to a +damage+falloff bonus set.reason being a decent gain (10%/lvl) in falloff would be the best way to narrow the gap on the scorchapoc and javraven when using ac's, keeping it competitive to a 'phoon but trading a bit of dps for a beefier mid-range. this would also give artillerys a nice boost on effective range without making the tempest just an apoc-clone.the double damage bonus of say 10%/lvl (+/- depending on just where the projectile changes go) would give the tempest a real niche as the king of alphastrike for gangs and small fleets without obsoleting the maelstrom as the tempest would still be behind in dps and ehp/tank."
9/28/2009,"hello all,if you are lambda member this will probably not be interesting for you thought you may be interested.if you are corp/alliance ceo or managers this thread will surelly interest you please take time to read it and comment it :)many people are talking about dominion regarding change in souverainty and so on.i think that as ccp what to give more dynamism to alliance and boost internal and local production. to do so, ccp need to totally rethink the system regarding acces rights and corporate hangard.everyone, knows that corp thiefs are commun in eve and that they take advantage of a rather basic and non efficient right management system.dominion will bring new features and needs that are to be : larger acces to warehouse, more people in charge of corp and alliance assets/work and more asset splitting within corporation.the probleme is that the existing system is not good at all to manage and make possible such changes.-not easy to manage. ( it does not have a clear hierarchic map)-not easy to set up new titles as it needs hours and hours of testing (making sure that the title does not give backdoors and make what you intend it to do).-not easy to track : the only thing you can track is member last log-in and pull a query on each type of rights or title.- base on a limited number of title and warehous : only 10 title can be created, only 7 warehouse availbale for corp.- pos title totally non sense : when you own a pos, ceo or managers must give you rights to acces all tower creating a very big security issue.- bpo use require too many rights and acces to be used by everybody : a bpo option in personnal and corp/alliance should allow everybody to use them like a hugh library that can be used but not taken.- wallet acces are required when using pos production modules: how stupid is this, you own the pos, do not set charges on it so you don't pay but you still need to have acces to pay 0.0 isk !!! so on 7 wallet one is automatically blocked to allow people to use lab, prod array and so on.maybe ccp should think about changing radically the following things :- create a map of title clearly showing access, links and what can be done with it. - add more corp warehouse.- create alliance warehouse.- create alliance title and rights with a cross corporation system.create an efficience title tracking for title changes and so on.- find a way to avoid giving acces to wallet when using pos structure that are charged 0.0 isk and so.- create usefull and clear logfile for warehouse and rights/title modification.- add an option to bpo so that they can be used by corp members without having them able to take or see bpo >> bpo library or so ( minerals would be directly taken from personnal assets no need to drop in corp asset.- create real private title for personnal pos owner.- add wallets.many other things can be added.please fell free to add or discuss my propositions.i hope that guyz from ccp will take this in account.the more people will reply and add content the better chance we will have to get change in this right acces management nightmare.best regards.original post"

9/28/2009,"well, i was playing this game for almost 2 years now. i have few friends who tried the game. they all quit.1st was a wow-like mmos player for whom eve is way too complex.2nd was a teenage son of my friend. both are wow players, too. he wanted to pvp badly but didn't really want to put any effort to learn how to fly his ship. in the end his dad who saw his son playing, told him that the game is crap.3rd guy. an aircraft mechanic. liked it, although didn't even try to enjoy the social aspect of the game. in the end he decided that the game costs way too much and he prefers to spend 15 euros a month on cigaretts.4th guy. again a wow player who got bored with it. wanted something different. he played eve for 2 weeks and got back to wow.5th. bio or environment or sth engineer. he liked the game, although he thinks it's too expensive.and me. i have 2 accounts. main characters having about 27 mils sp each and tbh with you, there's a lot of newbies who play this game in a much more enjoyable way, than i do. simply because i lack the ideas on how to use my sps and i'm too lazy to think and come up with some strategies and tactics.what's more i've not so long ago got my first solo kill in pvp. and no. i didn't drop a dd on top of a noobship. i used a t1 frig set up in a noobish way which doesn't require millions of sps. it did require some knowledge on how to set the overview, how to use a scanner etc (brains or willingness to learn game mechanics over sps).conclusion:1) there are many people who won't like the game. simply because they lack ideas how to have fun with it, and they are probbably cheaters and premium features lovers (*) or would just like the game producer to show them some simple way of playing. i'm not saying that's bad as everyone's different and i used cheats in games too, but there are games for them already.2) wow players might not like the game, as it's completely different mostly because of a vast freedom of choice in character's development, ships' fitting, trading strategies which all make this game very complex and confusing. following this way of thinking giving a new player more sps at the begining would only add to complexity of choices concerning character development and proper fitting of a ship. in fact, getting the skills to use eve's interface properly and increasing awareness of game mechanics saves more isk and gives more opportunities of a balanced fight than lvl5 skills and t2 ships.and one more thing about ccp's ads and recommending the game to other players. i doubt that ccp's goal is to get millions of fans who just hack'n'slash everything that moves. when there's an advertisement of a luxury car on tv it's not aimed at achieving attention of people who can't afford to buy it, even though the product itself may look tempting. besides i doubt ccp could even compete with blizzard who dominaites hack'n'slash market. the same way luxury car producers don't bother to compete with companies that produce cheap cars in large numbers.if you don't recommend eve to your friends it won't hurt ccp at all. eve has at least 100,000 players who will ;)the last thing. an easier game = more players.(*) there are some premium things in eve already, though. one can buy an etc from ccp and sell it for isk, thus giving ccp more money for the cluster upgrades and allowing poor players who have the will to find a way of earning some good isk quickly to keep on playing.and there's of course already mentioned by thread's author himself a possibility to buy a character from another player. it again requires either cash or some some consideration and strategy on how to make enough isk fast."
9/28/2009,i agree that all players should get couple million sp to assign (not just new ones).most of people that disagree here are not really new players and so they think that everyone has isk backing and some other character to play.new player will start with around 60k sp and won't be even able to fit civilian damage control on their ship.its true that they can remap to learn learning to 5 and then to train for retriever or hulk but as a 3 month old player i assure you that is not road that new player takes but rather designated alt route.if you are telling somebody what route to take you are probably making sure that person moves on to some other game as they will hate game in which all they can do is mining or mission running.its mine understanding that in the past players were able to pick career option that gave them around 800k sp and they were able to move on from there.ccp should have built on that system instead of creating current one where you get 60k sp and speed learning bonus.perhaps they should even remove learning skills from game as well as some of the most assinine skills like targeting and some others that don't serve real purpose but level 5 might be required for soemthing useful.
9/28/2009,"i only read the first paragraph and i stopped cause i can't hear myself anymore. i screamed, yelled, whining, *****ed too much here.in other words. no. you will suffer just like alllll of us.besides, just because you got 5m sp doesn't mean you know how to fly a ship effectively in combat. get in a corp that will learn you the ropes. if they don't do that and if thats what you need. change corp..seriously cause they suck"
9/28/2009,"no, no, no.having a bunch of skill points to toss around still isn't going to do these people any good because they still don't have the player knowledge to effectively assign or use them.newb: ""woo! i spent my 10 million sp, now i can fly carriers!""corpmate: ""great, i'm in trouble, assign me some fighters!""newb: ""what are fighters?""corpmate: *boom* we all see the results when some cash loaded newb comes in, sells a bunch of plex, and buys a character with wtfomgbbqpwn skills. and then promptly loses a nyx or something similar 20 minutes into the game, and then comes to the forums to whine about it."
9/28/2009,"really, whether they are saying it nicely or not, the rest of the people in this thread are pretty much right.either you enjoy the game and skilling system, and work with it, doing what you can as you gain more sp.... or you don't.if you don't and would rather have game time = ""leveling up"" sp-wise, wow or the like is your game and ccp doesn't mind you leaving to play it. if ccp wanted the game to be the hotest, greatest, and top game out there they would have designed it wow like as you described. instead, they want a game they enjoy making and we enjoy playing. and in the process they have done a lot for new players to get into it easier along the way. but no, they won't hand everything to you on a silver platter.by the way, they have new players that quit due to realistic new player limitations (the kind that show the player that this must not be the game they want to play), but they also have new players that keep playing because it is a fun game and they enjoy the skill system."
9/28/2009,"esp if they are coming from a game where you do not loose your stuff when you die.i am constantly confused at people who use 'and then they went back to wow' as a justification for changes to eve. if they went back to wow, it is because wow works better for the... eve is not wow and is different because it is designed for people who are not interested in wow (in general at least)"
9/28/2009,"most corps that advertise that sound anywhere close to compelling have sp requirements that are sometimes 6+ months to attain.it's pretty easy to get into a cruiser, but it seems that cruisers are a giant wall. getting into anything bigger is suicide because you won't be able to fit it with anything remotely usable without spending 35-70 days of training.the problem isn't that it takes so long.. the problem is that you are relatively worthless for months. yeah there's ways you can get creative to use a newbie, but then again.. how creative are people? everyone agrees the learning curve in eve is extremely high. this is due to a lack of general creativity and problem-solving skills of the player. however, keep in mind it is up to the game to entertain the people.. not the people to find a way to entertain themselves! not all people are willing to hunt and peck for a reason to play a game.i love space, i love space ships, and planets and in general anything that resembles sci-fi. eve was the best game that is being offered, but despite my sincere desire to play the game, it took me 3 cancellations before i finally ""got it"".i love the idea that skill points are earned at a dramatically increased rate for new players. i think it should be more so and possibly even accelerated further, descending with time.. instead of just dropping you off the edge. first week 4x, second..6th 2.5x, 6th week...10th week 2x, 10..12th 1.5x landing the player around what? 8m sp in 3 months of play? meaning after playing eve for 3 months, you can join a guild of your choosing and have had time to make mistakes with your skill tree and had the opportunity to fix them without being stuck in the tar pit."
9/28/2009,"wrong. eve is a niche game for those of us who know how to (and get the most enjoyment and entertainment from) finding our own path to fun. the numbers of people who ""get it"" continue to increase year over year. it's not a problem, that the majority of gamers don't get it, it's evidence that the vision has not been lost."

9/28/2009,this has my support.
9/28/2009,csm term limits received a total support of 3 with some csm members opposing it. how can this be in the 'submission' and receive any credible ccp input?waste of time better spent elsewhere.
9/28/2009,maybe i should apply to become csm. at least i already know i am caesar.i like it how it is now tbh. though 1 change might be to get actual representation.aka get at least 2 carebear positions. 2 market jockey positions. 2 low sec positions. 2 0.0 positions. i also like the idea of alliance leaders getting in there. it kinda proves that ccp isnt padding the csm with ccp employees. then again... enslaver from lotka volterra turned out to be a ccp employee.
9/28/2009,"as many mission runners know, once you go below -5.0 standing with a faction it becomes impossible to run missions for them. the remedy for empire faction standing is simple - run missions for sisters of eve. for pirate factions, you can only raise faction standing by running missions for an allied faction. if you're -5.0 with those several factions, you will never be able to repair that standing.coming from other mmos with various npc faction systems, i'm completely opposed to designs that enable players to permanently damage standing. the system design for empire factions may be a tedious, long slog, but it's appropriately available as an option for those that want to do it.more to the point, under current pirate faction standings design, players with a second or third account have a tremendous advantage. they simply train a week's worth of social skills on a fresh alt, and can then actually run/complete missions using their main character. this proposal doesn't affect me, personally, as i have multiple accounts and have not yet irreparably damaged my standing with any faction. still, i think it would be a good improvement to eve. i suggest sisters of eve missions be modified to also give standings to pirate factions, or ccp create a new corporation which would work for pirate factions the way sisters does for empire factions.see the third post, below, for an interesting alternative method"
9/28/2009,specially for people who've been running loads of missions in empire before heading out in 0.0 space.while beginning your eve career you won't have any idea that those missions will prevent you from ever doing pirate faction missions ever again.
9/28/2009,"a corp mate just made another alternative selection:create certain agents in each home region of all factions that, for a price, reset your faction standing with all factions. the price would be a hefty 1 billion isk or similar, and have the benefit of serving as an isk sink while also having the drawback that it would reset all positive faction standings to 0 as well as negative ones. for role players, this could be explained as obtaining new identity documents.edit: after thinking about it briefly, i realize that this might also appeal strongly to empire-based mission runners and those participating in factional warfare. as long as you lose positive standings with negative, i don't really see a downside to it. that, in combination with the cost, (it could be escalating or a fixed fee), would serve to deter people from using it frequently. it could also have a cool down period like neural remapping, if ccp thinks that is necessary.i'm, personally, pretty open on whatever the mechanism would be - isk sink, time sink, you name it. whatever the solution, it should remain independent of security status, though. for example, you shouldn't have to run missions killing concord/ded in order to raise pirate faction standing. there may be some that are, but i assume they would be rare and you could decline those."
9/28/2009,"i support both these possibilities, there really needs to be a way back if you messed up when you started the game. i messed up my standings doing lvl4 missions for caldari, witch kept me out of fw and from doing missions for pirate factions (yeah all of them) ccp make this happen one way or another."
9/28/2009,supported. or add lp rewards that forgive some amount of negative standing with that faction.
9/28/2009,just an idea:1. get an alt?2. let that alt grab missions for you?3. ????4. profit!
9/28/2009,"he specifically mentioned that and stated it as a disadvantage to people without multiple accounts.another idea: run missions you can run and turn those lp items into standing for pirate factions, i.e:i run khanid navy missions and purchase a khanid navy energized adaptive nano membrane. i smuggle this item into delve and sell it to an agent there who trades me the item for standings. the agents will want specific items that are already attainable and some rp thing can be put in about their stocks running low or needing them to reverse engineer. keep the idea of smuggling and black market trading to keep it interesting. this would keep ccp from having to program much more than a new agent into the game and the ability to increase standing that way. also, while running missions, it might hurt your standings a bit, but they should be more than offset by the items.could be tags too."
9/28/2009,"i support this, even if i'm not impacted, but to make one part of the game better for a lot of players."
9/28/2009,"hello, i know several sides of eve and wanted to suggest an idea, covering several issues.1) too much isk in the game2) too many players leaving due to character growing slowly3) many people having a weird feeling about certificates being good for nothing.kill em all! certificate does not look like a piece of game character like skill, it looks like something more formal, achievable, acquirable. and yet they dont get too deep into the game, just towards real good core and ok spec skills. so let the eve universities sell them! certificate needs all prerequisite certificates to be bought and a big sum of money to get, training all the prereq skills missing. i'm talking about approx 20 bils for core competency elite summed up.after like hour of intense thinking, i'm really sure it wont upset the balance, it will get iskies out of the game quicker and it will get rid of people from level based mmorpgs complaining unability to use their massive online presense to catch up with the bigger guys.p.s. i'm almost sure someone must have raised that issue already, but maybe related to skills only? but evesearch is unreachable atm, so i eagerly spam what i feel like being right. thanks for reading."
9/28/2009,"eve has defined itself as a game where time is significant. you need to subscribe for a period to earn sp, you have to be active (to change skills) and you can earn isk to purchase equipment. ccp earns money from you submitting to this treatment of game-play. therefore, what's wrong with your proposal:(a) ccp loses money due to not requiring players to subscribe to the game for longer periods of time. i myself buy gtc's when i want to make another character etc but not stop my training process. what you propose would mean i wouldn't need to buy those gtc's on market, price may go down (if global effect is strong) and then less people will supply gtc.(b) unfair treatment towards older players of eve. these players are ccp's real market, they have earned ccp a steady stream of income over the years and probably for years to come. do they really want to wake these sleeping giants?(c) breaks the imagine of eve online. what makes eve different from wow? well for one, the skill process. i hate playing games where the troll standing next to me is 30 levels higher simply because he has no life. eve doesn't reflect the amount of social life you've thrown away playing the game.that is why i'm not going to support this. to change that feature would be to trim the advantages or differences which set eve apart from every other mmo. these differences are important!"
9/28/2009,"argonius i heartfully thank you for a very good note of criticism, it basically means putting together all issues possible due to my suggestion.and you are right, basically what you said is the real drawback of what i'm offering.however, i'd like to once again stress on the big part of isk cost. if you think 20bils is not big enough make it 100bils. for reason. respect to older players - man, remember how actually many skills are out of certification planning cover for good and are not achievable through proposed system.time based nature of the game - big cost stands for it. to get the money you need time. it's just a question of deciding how big.not selling gtcs - and where do you think a person from out of the game would suddenly get all that isk with isk farmers currently in rapid decline? right - from buying gtcs and selling plexes to the community, while plexes as you know, are very well affected by existing marketting balance.and one single attack on you because only one part of your position surprises me - sacrificing social life is supposed to be a bonus? wake up, cool people often just buy characters here and do such amount of insta trolling that any user of proposed system would be left to nervously smoke nearby. in all, i'll end here. our two votes form a nice shape of pros and cons of the mentioned idea.thanks again."
9/28/2009,firs of all you failed at searching. buying sp was a topic not even a week ago. and the consensus was no.what many players really fail to understand: training the sp is one thing. learning how to use those new skills properly is a 2nd thing. last but not least ... just because a skill is training doesnt mean you cant do anything in eve. and btw ... buying certificates/titles irl is also illegal. you have to stay there and do all the tests aswell.that said ... not supported.
9/28/2009,"why the hell would i want to spend isk on something that is nothing more than a piece of paper saying ""i know this""?"
9/28/2009,"i think he's talking about spending isk to get certificates which would give you the sp specified in the certificate.if that's the case, fail for another thread from a new player that wants sp but doesn't want to wait around for it. in wow you spend every waking moment killing x number of rats to make your character level up. in eve you set skills that train over real life hours. much better, in my opinion, which is why i'm playing this game.if he meant spending isk to get the certificates after you've skilled, which we currently get for free, i'm with drake and would just say no to certificates. they would be pointless.the day you can buy sp, with isk or otherwise, is the day i quit eve as it would have become neopets online, pay money for your new clothes on your character, yay! thankfully, that day will never come."
9/28/2009,it's a rhretorical question at best but yes.. my sentiments exactly.buying sp? hell no.an isk sink for cert's? hell the majority of the playerbase doesn't give a damn over certs at best!
9/28/2009,"here's a thought- though admittedly, i probably wouldn't support my own idea, despite it benefiting ccp:players submit plex cards to concord covering the amount of days they want to train- in other words, say you were 90 days away from the skills needed for a hull tanking - elite certificate. you would submit 3 plexes to concord in exchange for the skills- that way you tie it in to legally purchasing isk, and ccp gains revenue overall from plex sales.^rough idea, like i said- but i'm curious what your opinions are of it."
9/28/2009,any buying sp for money is wrong.
9/28/2009,1: get cash or grind for isk2: get lots of plex3: trade up for sp4: sell 3 day old uber account for a crapload of isk5: rinse and repeat.conclusion - anyone who makes a suggestion for buying sp is a ####ing ######## of a idiot.sorry... you have no excuse for not thinking ahead.please people... give it up... stop turning eve into wow.
9/28/2009,"while i largely agree, i have to nitpick one point. if any well-funded capital force can get pirate faction ammo, and is willing to do so for a 10% dps boost, wouldn't they still be willing to do so for a further 5% boost after this change? maybe pair it with a drop rate decrease on the good stuff, to keep capital ammo as a whole on par with the status quo. also, now that titans have real weapons, i could support +20% ammo, as long as it's rare/expensive enough that only titans can really use it. but that's a really minor issue."
9/28/2009,"considering the only place to get high-grade 20% ammo now is from faction drops, and for high-grade faction capital ammo there'd have to be faction capital *ships* to destroy (outside of l5 missions), that's a good reason not to put it in the lp store. and nothing would stop them from using the 15%. but the 10% might be cheap enough through mission runner competition to justify using it in poses. the only way i could see putting the 20% stuff in is if it were dropped in 5,000 round bpcs dropped from faction rats.also, supporting my own proposal."
9/28/2009,the issue is if a revelation uses xl faction. the crystals become dmged or unpackaged. the revelation dies... and you're left with unsellable crystals. so you just reprocess them. this leads to alot of waste in these crystals. to the point where faction xl crystals practically dont exist on markets in empire.moros on the otherhand has stackable ammo which makes it's way back onto the market.either way... bring back empire xl ammo means a large supply for dreads to use to do more dps and kill more. cant see the problem here.
9/28/2009,"i, too, want extra pewing power."
9/28/2009,"last time i was in any semi-major trade hub, the supply of pirate faction ammo seemed fine to me. granted i only looked at seprentis and dark blood, but i have to assume theres angel ammo out there too.empire mission runners have plenty of stuff to cash in their lp for already. the pirate mission runners in 0.0 have my support on this one.not supported."
9/28/2009,"the last thread on this matter is locked due to inactivity and as far as i can tell (eve-search, csm wiki) this matter has not yet been raised by the csm.[proposal] increase maximum fleet sizethe current maximum fleet size in game with full skills, wings and squads is 256 members, with most major alliances able to max that out easily with a cta mail, or announcement a few days in advance of the operation. it is my opinion and the opinion of other members of the larger alliances that increasing the fleet size to either 512 or larger decreases the hassle of organising two fleets at the same time, for those that don't know that would include two sets of warpins, cyno's, titans (for bridging simultaneously) and in some cases two fcs for broadcasting/calling targets.in the upcoming dominion expansion ccp have detailed that to keep their 0.0 holdings, alliances will have to utilise more of their systems. this entails either installing pets, or bolstering alliance membership numbers. these new members would also be expected to fleet up to protect their space, making the current fleet member cap more and more awkward, especially for the current alliances who can already max fleets out...fixing the problemeither through increasing the number of pilots able to join each squad, or increasing the number of wings able to be created in a fleet.this may have to entail new skills to reach these new numbers.pros and conspros: decrease in the amount of work needed to operate a large fleet.cons: none that i can think of, also this would in no way encourage larger fleets or more blobbing, the current (or future) numbers would just be grouped together under one fleet."

9/28/2009,"agreed, even though it is a *cough* atlas member asking for bigger fleets"
9/28/2009,"yeah, 256 is far too low in this era. if there's going to be a hard cap at all, it should be north of a thousand. i'd be fine with adding a rank 16 ""armada command"" skill to unlock it, if you want to keep small-gang skill reqs the same, but the cap is far too low."

9/28/2009,"yes that why i choose to look at the results of 95 years worth of pvp activity.in 95 years worth of pvp data there are going to be the results of all types of scenario's.statistacally no weighting has been applied to different types of scenario - to do this would require the exercise of opinion.the raw data allready contains an accurate weighting of all different scenario types. yes you can keep trying to incinuate this to other readers , its not true however many times you say it.non of the raw data is from my own activity.the same formulas have been applied to all ships equally and without prejudice."
9/28/2009,"would a fleet-wide overview option available to the fleet boss (only) to select ""all cloaked ships keep distance at 3000 meters from same"" be viable?othe ideas:a leadership-based skill that grants pilots in a squad/wing the ability to see each other.a high or mid-slot module that gives all pilots in the same squad the ability to see each other."
9/28/2009,decloak immunity is a step too far.what would be useful is the ability for cloaked ships to indicate their position on-grid via the broadcast window to other fleet members while remaining cloaked. that would make retaining your cloak a matter of co-ordination and intelligence rather than dumb luck.
9/28/2009,this would kind of make sense.it would make deployments of stealth ships somewhat less problematic.
9/28/2009,this
9/28/2009,"this or tactical formations as fleet options, which would keep the ships far enough apart."
9/28/2009,agreed & supported.
9/28/2009,"i suggested this back when stealth bombers were originaly upgraded to cov-ops cloaks and it's nice of scatim to repeat it...make the 'in position' broadcast to fleet work for cloaked ships.as it is now broadcasting while cloaked just defaults to the nearest planet, but if it displayed your location in 3 dimensional space where everyone on grid and in fleet could see it then it becomes a test of comms and coordination to position ppl without de-cloaking each other.but for now thumbs up as something needs doing."
9/28/2009,"so if i understand this right: a neutral, enemy, bad guy, good guy or anyone that is not in your fleet will uncloak you. but only the people in your fleet will not uncloak you ??? whoaaa, don't know who's your pusher but give me his number. i want what your smoking ?on a serious note. no. doesn't make sense. theres more ways to work with this limitation. since your doing bombing runs you should be able to figure a way for this so don't ask me. i won't even reply here to tell you."
9/28/2009,supported!i'd also like to see some way to actually see my cloaked friends in the gang!
9/28/2009,"valid gripe , but your solution is too powerful.i would support gang members being able to see each other ( using the cloaked graphics ).this could be explained rp wise as the ships transmitting to each other there positions through there ftl interfaces.some work would be needed on the gang warp to keep ships adequatelly spaced off course."
9/28/2009,someone who's got time will have to c/d this but i understood that the following was truea) ccp were aware of the decloak issue and agree that it's not intended behaviourb) ccp want to remove the issue but the coding is somewhat complex so it'll be fixed soon(tm)in any case continuing to poke them about it is a good thing. also anyone who votes no has clearly never tried to run a cov-ops only gang and thus is not entitled to an opinion
9/28/2009,absolutely yes please
9/28/2009,supported! making it easier for fc's to organise fleets would make combat in this game all the more fun :)i'd altso like to see more hotkey's:
9/28/2009,"thumbs up. as with most proposals of this nature, numbers need tweaking (specifics) but the idea is great."
9/28/2009,"no support. as said above, i don't find it a problem with cloaking. in fact, it's a tactic used to scare miners/ratters into docking up and if you can afk in space all the time then that's a total day of loss for them. if they start ratting/mining - you attack one and show them your waiting for them to get sloppy.sb's already give off a huge amount of damage and catch people despite being listed in local. only poor pilots would complain about this.on that note, when i mine i usually watch tv or play another game while doing it so i'm not always looking at local 100% of the time (cause i'd die of lack of player involvement)."
9/28/2009,great idea :dsupported all the way
9/28/2009,"i had an idea that might reduce the amount of time it takes to travel. i call it jgl for jumpgate linking. how it would work is simple, a ship would come up to any gate and with the right skill(s) you tell the gate to link with the next couple of gates that would be in your route, therefore you might be able to avoid low sec. system that are being camped or just save time to your main destination. skill sets that can come from this is :1) jgl skillbook x8 (enable jumpgate linking subsystem within gate network. lvl4 lets you jump 5 gates within region. at lvl5 you can jump 6 gates across regions. penalty: 30 second wait time per gatelink.)2) jgl reliability x5 ( lvl1 15%, lvl2 30%, lvl3 50%, lvl4 70%, lvl5 90% of successful jgl)3) jgl waittime reduction x5 ( lvl1 10%, lvl2 20%, lvl3 30%, lvl4 40%, lvl5 50% reduction of waittime per jgl)4) jgl pirate gate x5 ( allows you to use jgl on pirate gates only. lvl4 lets you jump 5 gates within region. at lvl5 you can jump 6 gates across regions. penalty 20 second wait time per gatelink.)the system would be limited to two groups ie: group 1 - freighters and group2 battleships and battle cruisers type shipsshadowburn"
9/28/2009,"no.saving time: eve travel is too quick already. this woiuld just make the game feel even smaller, which is exactly the opposite of what's needed.reducing risk: you can already reduce the risk of lowsec travel by planning appropriately, making use of the intelligence tools available, and using scouts or cloaked ships. we don't need to remove the exposure to these risks, we need to teach people how to prepare for them and work within them.not supported."
9/28/2009,this idea sucks.think the consequences through.
9/28/2009,"being smart, travelling in lowsec is as safe as highsec. sometimes i feel less secure in systems like niarja/uedama than i do in lowsec. oh and covert transports just rock :dso coming to the conclusion ... i cant really support this."
9/28/2009,you obviously didn't take the time to think about what would happen with such a system in place as a whole did you?not supported yet an another noob proposal.
9/28/2009,i'd buy me a second monitor just for this tbh
9/28/2009,"exactly. i work on webpages and setup domain names and alias domains and subdomains. it would take a total of 15 minutes max. and since eveonline.com is already mirroring portions of eve-online.com, it wouldn't be that hard at all."
9/28/2009,oh really? it's that easy?for someone who claims to be an expert you sure make a lot of assumptions about how eveonline.com is set up.really smart of you... (golf claps).
9/28/2009,"introduction of tracking... yes.removal... no.lo-sec should give some degree of security, albeit a low one. the perfect tracking on sentries really does hurt the budding pirates most, though i suppose it does prepare them nicely for a life of getting the short-end of the stick on almost every game-mechanic where security status comes into play."
9/28/2009,well i managed more than once to make a suicide tackle and still get out in a frigate. it isnt all that bad. :)
9/28/2009,all it will mean is that frigates will be camping lowsec gates. bad idea.
9/28/2009,"fixed and also adding to the no camp. camp belts in small ships or defended locations in larger ones. lowsec shouldn't be nullsec. i think the balance is about right, even if i would prefer to catch those cloaky haulers..."
9/28/2009,well the idea is really tempting.what about flagging a character who is stealing from a can or salvaging if the owner of the wreck is in close distance to it (let's say 30 km). that would give a chance to warp disrupt the aggroer and try to destroy his or her ship. it would make carebears bring webbers and warp disruptors with them on a mission introducing them to some pvp if they decide to take part in it.and of course if the wreck would be farther than 30 km from the owner it would be treated as a leftover and would not bring a flag on a ninja-salvager.
9/28/2009,per ccp mitnal: per gm faolchu : per senior gm ytterbium : per ccp prism x : (these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleet.com.)
9/28/2009,100 ways to shoot yourself into the foot.1. shoot the guy salvaging/looting your wrecks....
9/28/2009,"it is considered my salvage by the code that determines whether or not i can tractor it. either it is my salvage or everyone should be able to tractor. btw, i do believe everyone should be able to tractor it...they should just go flashy red when they take it. if you want to salvage someone else's mission, you should be willing to risk your ship or bring friends to protect you."
9/28/2009,"wrecks are containers, which is why they are yellow.loot belongs to you, salvage does not. ccp supports ninjasalvaging per ccp dropbear"
9/28/2009,i for one think it should not matter as salvage and loot are one and the same
9/28/2009,no need for change. if you wanted that salvage. you would be the ninja salvager to it. if you dont make it to it before him. then you dont want it. thusly we can conclude easily enough... nothing bad has happened.
9/28/2009,"i am amazed by your poor logic. the same could be said about loot.i do not disagree that ninja salvaging adds something positive to the game. however, i do disagree that it adds something positive to the game when i have no recourse. i could at least hunt them down or war dec if ninja salvagers were not 2 to 4 week old alt characters in newb corps."
9/28/2009,tsunami of carebear tears in assembly hall incomming...if this gets done...
9/28/2009,"this: if carebares wants some ""risk-free"" missions, then he will have to take a dent at reduced income."
9/28/2009,"ohh, for the people that takes what the dev said exactly, it doesn't count cause theres a lots of rules that were removed by arguing and making points. even some devs do not accept some rules but what the majority wants, the majority gets.when you speak to them you can feel that there not accepting certain game mechanics... hey, its all about the money at the end. if 70% (made up number) are mission runners and there the most people who pay and doesn't accept the salvage issue going on. from a broad perpertive, you will have no choice at one point or another. so please, stop quoting what dev's told, thats not strong enough."
9/28/2009,this tbqfh\(^_^)/<U+266A>edit:agree!oh ye of little faith!
9/28/2009,"so, how come you can't tractor them? even when they're emtpy... actually, how come you get concordockened if you shoot a yellow wreck, but not a white one?to op: if you think this is gonna help you keep ""your"" salvage, think again. this will just become yet another can-flip mechanic, which i'm perfectly fine with."
9/28/2009,i am perfectly fine with that as well i just want the ability to shoot at them when they do it.
9/28/2009,"since ccp / csm seems to have rejected the issue, because of the server latency issues reverting this change back to no delay, i am proposing another possible solution that still prevents scanner spamming, but makes the scanner much more tolerable for pvp.i suggest giving the scanner a maximum of 5 scans without delay, and that each scan would take 2 seconds to recover. if you are feeling creative, you could even throw in some skills to increase this, like survey giving +1 scan per level, or making the number of scans based on the survey skill (which is almost useless at the moment). in pvp often you will find yourself needing to use the scanner rapidly, but for short periods of time when you are trying to pinpoint a target, like warping to a celestial then scanning a few belts, or checking a system in an interceptor/covert ops. i think this will be a huge improvement over the current scanner.people who simply spam the scanner will very quickly meet the 2 second scanner delay, so the extra load would be very minimal."
9/28/2009,it wont work. you can spam the button 5 times then you wait 2 seconds and you spam 5 times again. same thing. latency issues will come back again (from ccp's point of view ???). even the csm will not accept it and even if they do ccp won't.your proposal goes back to square 1; more information(scan results and all) sent to the user.
9/28/2009,"i mean that you get 1 (of 5) back every 2 seconds, you'd have to wait 10 seconds to get all 5 of your scans back."
9/28/2009,this idea is allready on these forums it was languishing back on page 20 or something like that though.might wanna go suport the original
9/28/2009,"yes herschel it was very late. no need to apologize, if you havnent noticed i love confrontation.for those who dont like my post, sorry, my iphone didnt come with spell checker, or micro soft word, i really did fail english although i speak english perfectly. if you think the timer sucks for a pc imagine trying to get your ideas out on an iphone while trying to play eve. i guess where i come from we were always more interested in what somone had to say than how they said it. when somone gives me a present i accept it whether it is gift wrapped properly or handed to me covered in duct tape because, i know that its not the box or the even the item inside the box but the thought behind it that really counts. that being said i do see your point's of view, i just find some parts of them extremley off point, snobbish, and just plain rude.herschel, in 0.0 when somone speaks they would be listed in the left box along with what they have said, same as now. the number bracket at the top of the chat would increase from 0 to 1the post would remain long after you or the person who posted it has jumped out of that system, also the same as now.once that person jumps out or loggs the number in the top bracket would drop by 1, again just about the same as now.the corporation icon in the right hand listing is where the real difference would be. after the person has spoken it would become more like its high sec cousin. the corporation icon belonging to that player would now have a bracketed number indicating how many members of that corporation that are currently present, that have spoken. if expanded it would open its drop down and any members of that corporation that have spoken and are still in that system would be listed. once one of the corporations members who have spoken leaves, then the number on that icon decreases and they disapear from their corp icon's drop down. when all members of a corp are out of a system then their corporation icon would drop from the local listing leaving only their character's post with their name link's and spoken words behind in the left hand text box.so yes, you would be able to track wether or not the smacker is still in your system unless he jumps out and then back into it, same if he loggs out, and the same rules would apply for you.the reason i didnt propose the delayed local idea is because i see a fundamental flaw. if a player is warping to zero one way running from a member of my fleet and i am trying to cut him off coming the other way the chance of him passing right by me are to high. i think that kind of system would make it almost impossible to chase people down, and would just lead to more station camping in the end. i can almost hear frank sinatra singing ""strangers in the night"" in the background.the reason for not spliting it into a chat local and an intel local are obvious. if your talking about getting rid of local as a reconissance tool then yes it would need to be switched out with constellation chat. that is an entierely different subject. i am here to propose an alternative to removing local. p.s. thank you for supporting"
9/28/2009,"fleet warps are great for people and fc's to use, but there are certain situations where they are a major nuisance.cover ops should not be forced to cancel fleet warps considering most times they happen unannounced. fleet warps cost cover op's time to get back on grid and are very hard to avoid due to the very fast warp time cover ops have. fleet warps of ships that need to idle for all of 20 seconds in a tower should have the option to void fleet warps so they do not have to drop fleet for such a ridiculous reason as 20 seconds of afk.spy fleet warping has it's benefits, and i am not against using it against enemies if you are lucky enough to get into fleet. but players will be stupid and forget to deactivate warps, so we won't lose this effect totally anyways, so while it will remove this feature somewhat, it will still happen leading to comedy kill mails."
9/28/2009,why not?
9/28/2009,1
9/28/2009,"i lost count of the times i used to wish for this when forming fleets. signed.quick edit - one side effect i will note though is that, from my experience, you ended up with a good command structure (not good discipline but that's another matter). i certainly used to invite only the same few people, and they would move themselves into the relevent squad commands and start handling the logistics of getting people in ships / fleet whilst i sent out scouts and prepared for the off. not a good enough bonus to warrent not having the link though"
9/28/2009,make the in game calculator a little bit bigger to me it looks a bit smallshadowburnmy 2 cents
9/28/2009,yup nice feature if it was a little bigger support
9/28/2009,my issue is really not with the pvp itself. but the exploit that allows non corp members to assist in highsec without flagging them hostile.
9/28/2009,"members of a non-npc corp are free to fire upon one another in high security space without concord interference.furthermore, not supported."
9/28/2009,"agreed. however, that's not what your proposal is asking for. revise your proposal in a new post, and i'd gladly support it.to those reading, what he's suggesting is that if a neutral remote repper reps person a when person a is fighting person b (person a and b are in the same corp), then the repper goes flashy to person b- basically, the same aggro mechanics that rr is applied to for out-of-corp aggression, and a completely reasonable proposal."
9/28/2009,you can stay away from a certain ship at x km that you choose. but that someone else can come closer. how about stay away from every ship on your overview ?just right click on the icon and select that global stay away option. thats it. done.
9/28/2009,"hell no.i get decloaked too, but it's because i'm not concentrating or flying well. do both and it ceases to be an issue. no it's not always easy to achieve, but if i can do it (sometimes) then so can you.structurally this wouldn't work either. there are a large (possibly infinite, but it's too late for my maths brain to work atm) number of sets of ship positions around you wherein a movement of 1 ship pushes you to break the approach rule. how do you then decide which of the n individual approaches should be violated? it's just a flawed idea from start to finish."
9/28/2009,"would make kiting and piloting fast ships so easy that you could train run-down hamsters to do it.automated flight controls should generally be avoided unless they include severe drawbacks, like ap always warping at 15km to gates for instance."
9/28/2009,if one of the items in you are trying to include in a contract is damaged the current mechanism does not flag this up til the very end of the contract process.this is extremly frustrating and timewasting when you have a large amount of items to contract to multiple parties.i suggest any items that are damaged and can not be included in the contract be named and flagged up at the first step of the contract process rather than at the final step.rm
9/28/2009,"absolutely and 100% supported....nothing more annoying than setting up a contract, and then at the very last step getting told you cannot do it."
9/28/2009,yes... and or included a red star that says 98% damaged next to a mod/ship/drone/ammo if we include them in a contract.nothing more annoying than trying to contract a chunk of stuff and trying to sort through a single damaged drone or a crystal that has been shot 5 times. or trying to contract a past ship that has 2% armor damage in a station you can't dock in anymore.
9/28/2009,"nice proposal. but imho you should have bumped one of the many old threads about the same topic. also this is part of the big ""contract features that suck"" thread of mazzilliu.maybe bump there instead of here?"
9/28/2009,i am aware of the various threads concerning the many problems with contracts but this is the one thing that bugs me the most and so far the first thing that i have felt compeled to highlight in this forum...so forgive me if i dont necro older threads and bring my particular concerns to the csm in a new thread..rm
9/28/2009,"hey guys.i'm not that good at making large, detailed propsal's but i will try my best to get everything you would want to know in.after spending quite a lot of time in 0.0, fighting in big alliance wars, gate camping, getting ganked ect... i felt that there was one major thing that could be make local better... a way of being a bit more stealthy when it comes to travelling around the place in a fleet ect, so i propose this: a new module, created specificly for covert ops/sb's/black ops. this module would be a highly specialised and expensive bit of equippment (to try and stop everyone running around low sec and 0.0 with these on, therefore their main use would be for a scout in a fleet, or possibly pirates ect). i think its important to note, that this module shouldnt be something that everyone will have... it needs to be at a level where most people wouldnt just randomly buy and use it, due to its price... but where its not so expensive that you would need to be in a big alliance or corp to use it... (for instance a small shared investment from a small group of mercs could make piracy in low sec more worthwhile for some, but could still be avoided by simple things, like having someone scout for youthaks alotzionner"
9/28/2009,"so you're pretty much wanting to add an extra hi-slot + fitting to every covops ship out there, as well as making people fit not one but 2 modules to be truely stealthy. no i think not.expensive isn't a factor btw. isk is easy to make, after all there are 200+ titans in game. the only way to restrict is by saying eg covops only or else it'll become as ubiquitous as cloaks on ratting ships. in fact, what you've made there is an almost 100% safe way to rat in quiet 0.0 systems.no."
9/28/2009,"in courier contracts the collateral and reward boxes are always pre-populated with ""0.0"" and you always have to backspace this out to put in your own numbers.could we get these 2 boxes initially displayed without a number in them so i don't have to hit backspace 4 times on every single courier job i write ever?"
9/28/2009,"personal tacticial data base (ptdb): is a way of gathering new tacticial information on npc ship, pod ships, stations, objects, unknowns, etc. this can be accomplished by:ptdb scanner i (high slot):a device that will scan npc ship, pod ships, stations, objects, unknowns, etc., and gather tacticial information for study at a later time.the information that is gather will be stored in a data pad or data modual for analsys in a station. the type of information that is gathered will be shield, armor, hull, ship design, ships base speed (+/- mods), weapons loadouts; npc info will remain static until ccp updates npc data bases, detailed images (a type of visual you get in-station). once a detailed analsys is made, a player will recive a max of 2% damage bonus for the ship.once a detailed analsys is made for a object ie. ore, gas clouds, a 1% bonus will be given. this in-world info can be traded, just the information and not the bonus of a susessful analsys. for the bonus the player has to have the right skills to begin the analsys.skill that might be needed for the whole ptdb is: 1) ptdb scan time ( 5% reduction in scan time per lvl)2) ptdb analsys ( 10% reduction in r&d time per lvl)3) ptdb scan range ( 10% increase in scan range per lvl)this can be cool new content driven exprience for new players, letting them have a look at ships and objects to come as they play on in the game. and a new tacticial way of playing for players that have been playing for a long time.another great idea fromshadowburn"
9/28/2009,you could scan down npcs with the onboard scanner in the past and ccp removed that. i doubt they will add it back
9/28/2009,"i dont know if it works with npc but using the ship scanner will be your solution. and with that info you gain more than your puny 2-5% or so. you will know whats his weakness since you know what he fits. if your prepared enough after you got this info and you do it right, he will die.my gawd alt scouts are so amazing in this case."
9/28/2009,"theres actually sort of a key if you go to overview-settings, there you can change which symbols/colors you want with what statuses. so its not impossible to use when you first learn it. but learning eve shouldnt be about learning symbols in a less intuitive user interface, it should be about learning to fit and fly spaceships! the eve ui, while its been much better over the years, still needs a lot more work.supported!"
9/28/2009,"i have been using this character as a dumping ground for shares for a long time, i have told many other players to send ""dead"" shares here too if they wish.this is an untrained alt, that is just holding a corp for me, so someday i am sure i will biomass him, and when i do all the shares will disappear.until ccp does something, which i dont see happening any time soon, feel free to treat this character as your dead share trash can."
9/28/2009,nice to hear about that ? i will check it
9/28/2009,"was originally planned as a ""democratic"" advisory council that ccp could use as a sounding board to make eve better if i recall.nowadays it resembles real life political institutions too much in that it is filled with people whose primary concern is their own interests rather than the game as a whole.but if the csm is meant to represent the player base as argued then the number of null-sec representatives needs a significant decrease.the 0.0 population is a minority whether you like it or not and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.one good thing that has come out of it is the assembly hall where the entire player-base is essentially acting as the afore mentioned sounding board, beyond that i see no reason for the csm to exist as it is still the loudest most persistent parties that get their way."
9/28/2009,its becoming inacceptable!!!
9/28/2009,"ok i realise i missed making this objection before the meeting, rl and all....but why oh why was this even an issue that made it to a formal council meeting?it was proposed by a member of csm, which seems a little bit like a conflict of intrest and self serving.the discussion thread only garnered 3 thumbs up, which does not really seem to indicate much support from the player base. if you actually go through and read the comments most of them seem opposed to mazzilliu's proposal either in part or in whole.for myself the only thing i can really get behind is issler is getting treated with this very short partial term she just inherited counting against her 2 term limit. even though i dont really care for her views in most of the work she did with csm in her last regular term, i have to say that getting ""promoted"" to a full council member from an alternate status this late in the term, especially after the ccp visit, and having it count as a full term of service is just unfair to her and those who had hoped to elect her to a full council position in the future.p.s. i wish ccp/isd would hurry up and approve the minutes of this meeting, so my rabble rabble could either be justified or nullified, by what you guys actually discussed."
9/28/2009,this might be really easy to implement... adjustable text font sizes for the overview.. getting a bit hard to read at 1920x1200 :(
9/28/2009,"wow here is an issue,term limits, that got more votes in the csm than in the thread that started it. this a bad decision. no one in favor of it has explained how putting ccp in the position of deciding who does and who does not get to be on csm does not open them to a charge of favoritism. and more importantly why csm would think that is a good thing?being a csm rep is something that the players get to decide by design. ccp stepped back quite deliberately from interfering in that choice. the present csm feels it is ok for ccp to be involved in choosing our reps. let us hope ccp is wise enough again to decline."
9/28/2009,"yep, its embarrasing.use firefox with the dev tool addon and resize text."
9/29/2009,"repairing hull damage without a station on fighters is easier said than done. first the scenario from which this idea came is if your in enemy or distant space (pos outpost). a properly fitted carrier probably will want to save that high slot for an extra dcu, smartbomb, heavy neutralizer etc. it's better to repair the main tank of the ship (armor/shield) than to aim for the hull. this is why you will most likely only see capital remote repair systems on carriers repairing a pos.station repair services do serve their purpose, to provide immediate repairs in a safe environment. space can't guarantee you this especially since carriers can only fly in low-sec.i personally don't think it should involve a cost unless the triage idea in here is implemented, which automatically has it's cost. however this is up to ccp as always to balance it out.i wouldn't even take them out if they had massive hull damage, they are remarkably fragile for 15 million isk drones. however since they provide huge amounts of damage vs battleships, battlecruisers and to some extend cruisers this can be justified.i do doubt if such a skill should come into existence. on one hand it would be nice to have a boost but on the other hand it adds even more time to the required skills for carrier list for the new pilots."

9/29/2009,who said directional scanners are only used to find pveers?
9/29/2009,"indeed who did? stop setting up a strawman . i said the 2-second change almost exclusively affects pvpers targetting belt ratters and miners. and to ***** and moan about that 2-second change is ridiculous considering they don't have a chance to survive an encounter against a pvp fit. so basically, let the change take its course. it might actually benefit you in the long run. this will require time, which i know can be difficult if you have a short attention span. you and everyone else should be able to easily adapt.you know that phrase you're always telling carebears? adapt or die? try it some time. or you could just see my sig, emo-rage-quit already."

9/29/2009,"100% support, any csm response please?"
9/29/2009,"i recently was trying to leave wh space and came across a cl-3 sytem that had over 14 towers in it. only one of which was active. if ccp does nothing about this soon cl-3 and below wh space will run out of moons to anchor a pos at. not sure what could be done there are many idieas out there and i support the hacking idea. something needs to be done soon though.as to shooting a pos in wh space....yeah try that one solo or with just a few bs's.to those of you who say just shoot it down and profit.....this isn't all about abandoned pos's at moons in 0.0 it's about highsec and wh pos's also. the abandodned tower spam in highsec is rediculous but much easier to take care of as you simply group your corp together, dec the owning corp, and remove the tower. for wh this presents a problem because you begin using the mass limits of the wh to bring in ships to remove the pos and then you can't get all you need through the wh to set yourself up. again something should be done."

9/29/2009,i support the changes to the minmatar line in general.
9/29/2009,cant comment on most of the points but pos's are needlessly complicated when you have to deal with alliance/corp security.the levels of access should be determined by launch state.launch/anchor for self:full access if you have the password. full director/corp pos manager access.

9/29/2009,":facepalm:i started out with 50-60k sp, had never heard of evemon or eve un iversity, there was no such thing as salvage, there was no lp store, and you had to get basic learning skills to level 5 before you could train the advanced. +3 implants were something like 18-20 mill each in mission hubs. ""double training rate"" and stat respecs weren't even an idea. i had no idea at all what i was doing when i made my character. pretty much the only things i got right were having a decent perc stat and choosing a character name with a letter from the middle of the alphabet.by the time i had been playing for 6 months i had already been through a major war in 0.0, made friend in eve with people i still count as friends today, created my own corp, and led it into first the drone regions, then to curse.stop making excuses, undock, and get started. you succeed in eve by playing it, not by having n millions of sp."
9/29/2009,"mate, i have some bad news for you.you know those sp requirements those corps have? they don't really care all that much about the sp. what they actually care about is combat experience. the sp requirement is just a first pass filter; if you want players with 1 years pvp experience, then filtering out people with less than 1 year's sp is logical.and i will bet you everything i own that virtually all of those ""compelling"" corps have members with considerably less than the ""minimum"" number of sp. the reason that those corps are ""compelling"" is because they composed of people who got out there and started playing as hard as they could from day 1. if you want to join them, dont cry for more meaningless free sp, do that. get out there and get started. 3 months pvp experience beats the hell out of an extra 5m sp.(bonus: you get the sp anyway)"
9/29/2009,"this, and then you actually learn about everything in the game. that fitting long and short range on your ship is not a good idea. that all of low sec isnt in complete anarchy. mission are utterly boring, and that infact 10 million isk is not at all alot. battleships are not solopwnmobiles and are very large slow moving targets, like fat deer in a field of lions when in low security.smartbombs are not high sec friendly"

9/29/2009,"as anyone who hauls a lot of stuff for other people probably knows, organizing other peoples stuff using anything but courier contracts can quickly become an exercise in tearing your hair out. containers can't be sized dynamically, ships cargo bays have no built-in organization system, and freighters cant even use anything besides the jumbo large general freight container. if you are moving stuff without couriers, often the only way to know who owns what is to open note pad and write everything down, which gets annoying.what i propose is to introduce a new service that would be available in all stations (npc stations could charge a small fee, player owned stations could be more configurable) that would allow you to select any selection of hanger goodies and ships, right click them, and wrap them up in shrink wrap. you could then apply any label you wanted to the wrap so you could use it as an organization tool in both haulers and hangers."

9/29/2009,i've been waiting for some changes to make not only artillery a viable option but also the tempest. i love how the tempest looks but it is just too gimp to fly. supported over and over.
9/29/2009,"you gotta be kidding right ?50% more dps at level 5 where everyother battleship only get 25% bonus at level 5if its alpha you like you could go with10% more damage per level , -5% rof per level ( this is equal to 10% more alpha , but only 5% more dps ) per level.so as you train up you get 5% more dps , 10% more alpha per level and your clip last 5% longer per level too."
9/29/2009,"that would be even less then 25% damage bonus(namely a 17% damage bonus). also if you might be familar with the tempest, this change is a slight dps lose, not gain(it got 5% damage and 5% rof per level atm). if you are not familar with it, there is a 40 pages thread in s&m to get a better picture.here you go"
9/29/2009,"projectiles are pre-nerfed by 25% rof (33.3% dps), so that with level 5 of your respective minnie ship skill you'll be on par with the damage output of another races' ship that has no damage bonus. this is similar to the cap usage bonus on amarr ships.so no, that would just make it terrible. please note that a 12.5% damage per level bonus would still do less damage than a 5% damage and 5% rof."
9/29/2009,"artillery definitely needs much more voly damage in order to be meaningful. also requires an optimal range increase for any other improvements to actually work.as for acs everything needs to be improved they are totally useless. optimal range, damage and tracking need love so i'm generally called in for an overhaul.beyond all things it is the large scale of ammunition that does not..... well ....scale. large needs to be improved so much more than medium and small."
9/29/2009,never thought of the fact that goonswarm would get every single member of them to vote on their preferred candidate.if this is the case i think it may be time to disband the csm because it clearly isn't working out as democratic as everyone thinks.edit: disband and never get a new one that is.
9/29/2009,"full reset of all standings for hefty fee and long cooldown period? i like this. provides replay prospects for characters and casual players.prehaps put these agents in low- and null-sec to make it even harder on those who want to use it, and include a security status hit in the cost - concord will not be amused with you bribing people wholescale like this (and concord standings will not be affected - i think they're already tied to sec status)."
9/29/2009,or charge 50m for each .5 (per alliance/faction) corrected up to a maximum of +2.00 so people can't simply buy their way up to ~9.99.anything that broadens anyone's ability to play should be in ccp's best interests and i support it.
9/29/2009,"how does that repair ruined standings?---something should be done, but no simple buy-back. no matter how much money, for some it will be too much, for others it'll be no problem at all.instead i'd add bribable agents, who will allow you to run a mission for them (""overlooking"" your bad standing), and refer you to storyline agents who'll help you improve your standing.perhaps make the quality of the mission dependant on how much you pay him? not much => garbage hauling, plenty => eliminate concord."
9/29/2009,"i like this idea. could just be something as simple as some documents that you need to bring to an agent for the faction you want to increase your standings with. like the high sec data centers. set a cap at -1.99 or something, that way you will be able to run missions for that faction and start repairing it through missions.as you would need to bring them to 0.0 there is a bit of 'risk vs reward' in it too."
9/29/2009,"yeah, anything is better than nothing."
9/29/2009,"each faction should have a ""corrupt"" agent available in null-sec or low-sec. the agent would agree to allow people with negative standing to run missions and build up reputation, but in return, would claim all of a player's bounties, rewards, and lp in return for the service."
9/29/2009,i'm more inclined to add an additional mechanic that restricts such a use for 1 year (much like neural remapping).with the 1 billion isk fee included of course.and faction warfare should be excluded as its a bit foolish to assume you can bribe your way back into opposed fw empire.you should leave the militia first.... then reset.naturally if you want to go back in... kiss your standings goodbye like wise.i'm a bit hesitant... so a cautious support here.darius - (your alt mission running) this only works for agents... i've been doing it for a rather long time and if there's any standings boost.. its null or very small... not enough and too painful to even try it.also to the op about soe solution? only valid for 2 of the empire factions.check the faction standings and you will see the only ones that get standings are the ones that like the faction.example - soe won't raise amarr standings... but ammatar mandate will.
9/29/2009,"drake: well the smart part of the alt is ... i can keep my empire faction mission running standing, and my alt takes all the standing for the pirate faction. best of both worlds imho. better than trying to get standing over and over again if you move to a different region."

9/29/2009,"blaster ships have always been the red headed step children of pvp. everyone loves the concept but hates the design.flaws of blasters compared to other race weaponry:megapulse:currently the mega pulse has approximately 3.5x the range of blasters. for this, it has 22% less tracking and about 14% lower damage. however, it's fall off range is near equal to the neutron blaster. for tracking, base stats + all level 5 skills on a neutral ship give the blaster an extra 12m/s tracking per 1km range. however, outside of 4km range with close range weaponry, it starts shooting in falloff. for the next 11km with close range weaponry, while the blaster is shooting in declining falloff, the mega pulse is shooting in optimal. so at an optimal of 15km, the megapulse is tracking an additional 132m/s of speed in it's optimal range. the blaster only gained up to 48m/s tracking in it's optimal ranged over the megapulse.the mega pulse also has a falloff of damage. the mega pulse will do 14% less damage in the first 4 km of range. however, with optimal plus falloff putting a blaster at 11km, the net yeild on damage has turned to the mega pulse by about a 35% advantage. at about 6km, the damage is equal. even worse is outside of 27km range, the blaster hits at virtually 0dps. the mega pulse reaches similar damage to a blaster out to 55km without any enhancers. the auto cannon:first and foremost is the difference in style of the ships that use auto cannons. while gal and amarr ships tend to be similar in style, the minmatar gain considerable speed and agility.their damage is being looked at, so i'll hold comment on that problem for now. however, auto's do get multiple damage types.capacitor is a big advantage for autocannon ships. blasters are heavy consumption items for capacitor. autocannons use 0 cap. tracking for auto cannons is virtually equal to blasters. however, with the expected changes coming with the ammo, auto's should soon be gaining some sort of tracking advantage to blasters, at least in varying ranges. range for auto's is also noticeably different. similar optimal at close range to the blasters with 3km compared to 4.5km, a virtual stalemate for close range weapons, auto's gain 7km of falloff with max skills on a neutral ship. with ranged ammo, the difference becomes more pronounced at 36km max potential range versus 27km for the blasters. obviously, there is a glaring deficiency with blasters. i think there are 2 solutions to this problem:1st i would boost blaster damage by 50%. this would truly separate them as the highest dps platform in game. in order for this to work, their energy consumption needs to go up by 1.2 per second per gun after max skills creating a lot of damage that is not sustainable for long duration.2nd i would boost blaster optimal range by 1.7 to 2.5km base. this would boost their max potential range to near 33km, still lower than autos, and much lower than mega pulse. but it would make up for this breed of ships that are much slower and bulkier than their minmatar companions. there is a possibility that the lower tiers of ions and electrons could receive smaller changes to their energy consumption and optimal, but all blaster damages need to go up near 50% for large gun tiers for the trade off of capacitor instability. smaller guns would need to be looked at separately."
9/29/2009,"for a numbers analysis:the neutron blaster mega with 3 damage mods t2 guns, drones and max skills would go from 1265 dps to 1710 dps. an armageddon will hit with same principles for 1184 dps at nearly 3x the range.the mega's max optimal range would go from 11km to about 14km using null ammo or about 18km with iron.it would consume 35 energy per second compared to the current 27 energy per second with no other mods on. that would cap it out in approximately 5.7 minutes (in head calculation, i'll adjust soon) compared to the current 10 minutes. that may not sound significant but after about 20 seconds, that translates into the loss of 1 800 booster injected for capacitor. it's optimal range with null would still be 1/3 the optimal range of a mega pulse with scorch. damage would be about 1110dps with null compared to a geddon with scorch hitting for 681 with 3 damage mods. neither uses drones in the calculation since they would add equal damage.the geddon would use 26 energy per second with that rof bonus at 5 with guns only and scorch. the mega would us about 30-31 energy per second with null.please note that the null ammo for a mega hits at 1km less optimal for about 250 more dps with oger 2s. that means that while it will do more damage if reliant on drones, the geddon can burn out of optimal to reduce damage, and have the ability to hit further away with other ammo.one consideration if this is an apparent problem is to reduce null ammo damage to bring back some balance. both ships have similar speeds, so to me it makes sense that if a mega is in appropriate range, it should always have a considerably advantage. range means more than dps in most situations anyways.minmatar and caldari always have the options of playing capacitor warfare games with their extra high slots which would affect a blaster boats considerably more if the energy consumption went up. caldari also have more range, and minmatar have more speed."

9/29/2009,"dominion is shaping up to be the big 0.0 expansion with addition of auto-payment of bills and a meaningful alliance management interface.with taxes being introduced in npc corps i feel it is appropriate that player corporations were given options other than a shared hangar and chat channel.below are some of the ideas i have on the subject had since reading the news about the npc taxation plan.- ability to move limited volume of goods between offices, perhaps a special container that only accepts stackable goods (ex. no used/researched blueprints). time limited like jump clones.- scheduling interface to plan operations.- integrate ship fitting with markets to assist when buying modules.- proper corporate standings towards factions and not just an average of employee standings. perhaps by allowing mission runners to forfeit standing gains or a ""standings tax"" (the obligatory rp element).- revamp of roles. needs to be more transparent and easier to configure.- shared bookmarks. a special folder in hq office where bookmarks can be entered and subsequently used by anyone with the proper role.- shared custom star-map routes.- ""warp-to"" using the corporate assets list for those with proper roles (don't think it is possible currently).probably many more good things that could benefit corporate life, but those were the ones that stood out in my mind.edits: crossed out inter-office movement of goods, as it will be too easy. sad, i hate ammo runs"
9/29/2009,"1 thing you did not mention is this for npc corp or player corp ? the latter would be logical since ccp wants people out fo there in other words.in any case, some of these are already a ""feature"" about to come out the the scheduling interface to plan operations. the first one is already doable if i understand right. you can move good between offices from corp hangar to corp hangar. for the standings, yeah i can understand your point but does ccp wants to see more towers in high sec cause thats what i believe is the goal your refering too. you are absolutely right about the roles. its never easy to configure the roles but the interface really needs a clean up and lots of clarity and even more features imo especially about the hangars and such. for example i would like people to have access to 1 pos or a certain pos. right now it is impossible to do so.the rest is not bad too especially for a null sec corp when you want your guys to take a certain route. so yeah, i support it since it makes sense."
9/29/2009,"changed title to reflect that it is meant for player corps.as far as i know the idea of interbus was shelved so moving things without an actual ship is not possible (or i have been missing out these past years) .. would have to be a low volume to avoid the obvious loop-holes.i couldn't care less about high-sec towers, they are more than easy enough to deploy as is. my ""goal"" is to give more tools for the roleplay inclined. a corporation should have the option to align itself with one side or another, not many rp'ers remain but it is (or was) a large part of eve.i tried making the initial ideas beneficial to corps regardless of where they live, but with the feudal system coming allowing proper rental agreement in 0.0 space, i envision more individual corporations living in 0.0 so slightly tilted in that direction.i just want the joining a corporation to have meaning beyond functioning as a sort of static friends list with a shared hangar."

9/29/2009,"misleading, because your analysis of the raw data does not. in fact, your weighting is ****-poor and invalid in certain scenarios, and you have presented no analysis of how common these scenarios are.which means that your conclusions may or may not be bogus; and definitely means that they're not admissible as proof, no matter how much you relax the standards of what 'proof' is.even if we pretend your method of choosing the data sample is valid. oh, yes, it is true, despite your attempts at misleading us to believe that ""raw data isn't mine, formulas apply to all"" means something by itself.consider that applying the formula to all ships, equally and without prejudice:if (has_jammer=true) { efficiency=1.0; } else {efficiency=0.0;}different results? you bet. therefore, using raw data which isn't yours and applying a formula to all ships equally and without prejudice does not yield a credible analysis by itself.that is pretending you have used valid criteria for data selection, of course."
9/29/2009,"pyramid quoting is bad mkay , if some of the drivel you were talking got lost , tough.theres no need to analyise the data to find out the proportion of different scerario's solo/gang/fleet whatever.you would only do that if you wanted to know the seperate abilities of each ship in each type of combat.we are not concered with that in this post , this post is looking at the overall abilities of each ship.each ships results in the total will be a combination of results from solo/gang/fleet encounters in the proportion that those events actual took place.with 95 years worth of data there is more than 15 times more pvp action takin into account than even a beta tester could have accumulated on his/her own since the game started.so the data is an order of magnitude more representative of all types of pvp than a single players total in game experiances can be.your formula is lol of course.ecm boats will by there nature when in the hands of experianced pvp'r end up with more results in the kill with column than standard damage boats. they will be on the kills of the primary with there weapons and kills they never did any damage too with the ecm's. as long as there still alive that is and proving value when those boats go down.ecm boats actually have an advantage at scoring higher as it is without setting them all automagically to 100% for some strange unexpected reason you have in your head.further more from raw data consisting of kills and loses how would you propose on extracting the information of which ships had ecm fitted anyways ?i honestly cant work out why a 100% minmatar player such as yourself would object to a list revealing the extent of minmatar ships superiority in pvp asnyways.i also cant work out why in the last year you have never flown a blackbird as you consider them to be such uber ships ?"
9/29/2009,"assuming your data selection method is valid, the data being valid does not mean the analysis is valid. we've been over this.95 years of pvp is just a buzzword. big data set != correct analysis.the example formula listed was to prove that your argument that ""i have a big (valid, if we want to stretch the point) data set"" and ""i applied a formula to all ships equally and without bias"" combined do not mean that ""my conclusions are valid"". successfully, at that, as even you agree my example is obviously worthless, and the presence of a worthless example means that a valid data set plus applying a formula equally and without bias do not mean that the conclusions drawn from that are correct. which incidentally shoots down your assertion that your conclusions are somehow magically valid because your data set is valid (doubtful) and you used a formula equally for all ships.your formula is fairly worthless as a metric of utility in a gang (in fact, the existence of a counter-example where your formula scores two ships in the opposite way to real utility which has been demonstrated already is enough to dismiss it as evidence), which is why your ""research"" is worthless as evidence of anything. without evidence, you're voicing your personal opinion, which has been noted.somehow i think we've been over this, but we can go in circles a few more times if you'd like.nice to know you feel your argument has been destroyed to that point that all you have left is a ad hominem."
9/29/2009,"well we were talking about the data here and the analysis below iirc.95 years of pvp is not a buzzword.95 ( players ) * 1 ( years worth of kill and losses in pvp ) = 95 years of pvp data ( fields ""kills with a ship"" & ""losses of ship"" )extracted data = effectivness ( numbers of ships killed with ship type / number of ships of type lost ) expressed as a percentage.& popularity of ship within its group ( numbers of engagements recorded for a ship ( kills with + losses ) ) / ( number of engagements recorded for ship's class ) also expressed as a percentage. your formula was lol because its inputs were not available in the dataset.you proved nothing except your total lack of understanding of ""this analysis"" & mathmatics in general.you also put your opinion of ecm is uber in the formula.something which i have not done in the analysis for any concept in the game.just as well then that the analysis isnt looking at utility in gang, rather the overall utility of the ship in game.yes you bring your opinion of the bb ( which you dont fly ) to disprove the analysis, but its your opinion of the bb which is incorrect not the anaylis.being the noob meat shield ship of choice does not entitle a ship to be classed as uber.well if your gonna resort to ad homs i thought i might as well do the same.i have debunked the ad homs thrown at me i see you cant debunk the ad homs throw at you.your are deluding yourself if you think i think you've destroyed anything."
9/29/2009,anyone that thinks amarr need buffing doesn't play this game.
9/29/2009,"it is absolutely a buzzword and nothing else, in a attempt to give yourself more credibility.what is unknown is the following:- effects of non-random data selection on the results - the percentage of killmails collected in relation of the overall numberwhen we want to say something about the scope of our research, we generally use terms like ""x samples out of y"" and such. when we choose data according to non-random criteria, we typically have some analysis of the impact of this.95 years of pvp data from the best eve pvp-ers is nothing but pure marketing. the measure has been proven to be not fully reliable for determining contribution in gang settings previously in the thread. without it being fully reliable and with gang on gang fights being included, and without a detailed analysis of how often it is wrong, we can only guess how reliable it is. meaning, anything based on that measure cannot by any stretch of imagination be called evidence.we've been over this. please prove that popularity within its group is balance related, or that there is any merit in lumping it together with efficiency. without that, you've just added another arbitrary measure to a analysis of a nonrandom data sample using a provably not correct measurement method. it is interesting how this is constructed as 'evidence'. think in logical terms.you have a - raw data, b - efficiency as calculated by you, c - real efficiency and d - conclusion.b follows from a, d follows from c, but c does not follow from b since a counterexample exists.therefore, talking about c and d here is speculation. speculation is not evidence."
9/29/2009,"i'm not going to bother quoting anything, since i don't feel like wasting my time looking for it.it's become obvious to me over the last 5 pages of data that the op refuses to listen to any argument counter to his own, even going so far as to claim that it's the minmatar and gallente pilots that ""don't want the information released"" as if there were some vast conspiracy to conceal it. at this point we start thinkiong of you in terms of being a troll and not a serous critical thinker. the occasional personal attack you've tossed out doesn't help your credibility on that score.your statisitcal method is flawed, especially the inclusion of the ""popularity"" metric. this particular measure is based on a flawed assuption, conscious or not, that a pilot will always choose the most appropriate ship for any given task - an assumption that i offered you a counterexample for in one of my own posts.your assertion that minmatar pilots don't want their supposed dominance challenged is laughable since not even the amarrian and caladari pilots who have posted in this thread agree with your statistical ranking. the point is, when your statistics don't match real life, something's wrong with the statistic, not with real life.honeslty, i think i understand what you set out to do. you perceived what you thought to be an issue with the balance of the ships in the game and attempted to establish a metric set that would demonstrate the problem. i'll give you the benefit of the doubt on whether those metrics were intentionally biased to support your position, and say you just picked a crappy ay to generate your analysis. that doesn't mean the original problem may not exist, however, just that your method pf proving it is obviously not convincing anyone.your argument is akin to the following:analyst: ""the earth is square""astronaut: ""wait, what?""analyst: ""my math shows the earth is square.""astronaut: ""this picture shows it's round.""analyst: ""whatever, it's still square cause the math says so.""astronaut: ""um maybe the math's wrong?""analyst: ""you astronauts are just trying to hide the truth!""astronaut """""

9/29/2009,"b follows from a , ( c follows from b )* , d follows from c.* in the context of this study as with all statistics c tends towards b as size of sample grows.what you call a counterexample is no such thing.you have an opinion of what c should be.you have based your opinion of the size of c based on the utility of a ship in a certain scenario or range of scenariosyou have not taken into account its utter fail in all the non favourable scenariosthat is why you cant reconcile what the data shows you with what your opinion of a ship is.you should tear yourself away from the bb's group for one moment and actually look at all the other groups.out of 34 groups ( supercaps removed due to small sample size , 2 irrelevants as none combats type vessels ) 28 are absolutelly spot on beyond any resonable persons arguements at indicateing the best ship in that group.5 are harder to reconcile but by no means controvertialleaving just the bb's group cruiser2 as a point of contention.so instead of concluding ""there is one ship which looks out of place , everything garbage "" a more sensible person would be thinking ""hmm this study looks really acurate, i wonder why the bb is not where i expect it too be ?"""
9/29/2009,loool...genius is never appreciated in its own time!![/tongueincheek]
9/29/2009,"c does not follow from b regardless of sample size. to prove that there is a statistical connection (since logical is out of the question when a counterexample exists) you would have to provide a study on how often do the scenarios where c diverges from b occur. you have not, so you fail.your opinion that c does not diverge from b is completely irrelevant from a viewpoint of truth, as you cannot substantiate that claim, but we can plainly see that it is possible that c does in fact diverge from b, and that is enough to invalidate your methodology.as you well know, if we're only assuming that c generally follows from b, we're talking about opinions. without a detailed analysis of the actual connection between b and c (and researching the effects of your nonrandom data selection and giving some proof that popularity is a valid measure of anything regarding real utility), this is just your opinion regardless of the size of your nonrandom sample, or any marketing buzzwords you like using to substantiate your claims.your opinion has already been noted. we've been over this for probably 5 times now.also: you cannot decide to ignore examples which undermine your methodology and keep the remaining results as is. if the methodology is not valid, then the remaining results might or might not be garbage; but any assumption that that remaining data is valid is just that - a assumption."
9/29/2009,there is a fine line between insanity and genius.and you sir... have seriously crossed that line.
9/29/2009,caldari already get enough boosts.it's just like another fat american kid you see on those 'super nanny' tv shows or something.edit: [proposal] ccp must make thumbs down buttons.
9/29/2009,"sometimes is neccessary to stick to your guns.there arnt many threads on the forums where people request a thread be closed or become abusive and demand that a thread is closed.maybe i'm reading to much into it but i think those who have demanded the closure of the thread are doing so because they in some way feel threatened.if it was just plain wrong , people would just ignore it and move on.personal attacks ( by me ) have only been used in response to pesonal attacks or incinuations i hope.not the best plan probably, but hey fight fire with fire.apologies to anyone who i have offended when they wernt trying to be abusive / incinuative.the reasoning ( flawed or otherwise ) that pop is a good metric for measuring the ability of a ship is based of course on the assumption that pvp'rs prefer ships that are good at pvp and on the assumption that pvp'rs know what the hell they are doing. thats the reason why i choose this group of players ( they are some of the best pvpr's in eve and they do know what they are doing )it is of course true what you say that they may not allways choose the best ship, but any random ship selection would introduce noise into the data it should not introduce bias.noise will tend to mask the true extent of a ships popularity over its class equivs. so the real value of a ships pvpabiilty will be greater than that decribed by pop in the data.yes i have only myself to blame for that really. i never should have introduced the data in a single list with the groups all mixed in with one another.look at the data grouped by class first of all , and you will see that actually most of the rankings do make a lot of sense.big post to be continued..."
9/29/2009,"kinda the truth. allthough i would say experienced the imbalance rather than percieved it.if your really interested in sequence of events i'd have to recall them being something like this.buy eve , choose caldari character.3 years of pve utterley pimping out caldari skillsget bored of pve and join pvp corp.start pvping with a more or less maxed missile caldari skills.get killed at lot at first but improve.after about another year after dread and carrier training start to look where to go next with skills.look at corp km's and see that gun users are doing plenty more damage on km's than i am.decide to cross train to mini / gal and amarr and gun skills.i found myself doing better with mini ships with t1 guns and base skills at level 3 than i was doing with caldari ships with t2 launchers and maxed base skills and advanced skills at lvl4.^^ this is when i realised something is not right with caldari.as i've trained mini and projectiles further i find myself really surprised at the disparity in ability between the 2 races.i couldnt figure out why this should be at first, then it clicked.missiles suck so much on caldari missile boats because of the really poor damage bonus they get compared to the gun boats ( i'm sure youve seen the thread )so i start up a replace kin bonus thread and the caldari hate posts start.people make all kinds of unsubstantiated claims in that thread and try to make missiles sound like some kind of panacia because they can switch damage type and other weapon systems cant, one of the arguments againt the proposed change was by a guy called gypsioiii who asked for a full and total comparision of ships and weapons systems etc etc etc.that of course was far too complicated a task for any one player to perform.well i come back to him with the data in this thread.i didnt know what it would show when i started the cut and past harvest of information.i just wanted to ""sample the opinion"" of the better players in eve as too what the best ships to fly in pvp are.i was surprised to the extent of the bias towards mini/gal and away from cal/amarr in the data hence this thread.i see the argument more like the following.copernicus: ""zmog the earth goes round the sun""layperson ""wait,what?""copernicus: ""my calculations show that the earth goes round the sun""layperson ""dont be stupid , the earth beneath my feet isn't moving""copernicus: ""yes i know you move round the sun at the same speed as the earth""layperson ""dont be stupid , your stupid and your analysis is stupid , the wind would blow us away""copernicus: ""the air is in a layer around the earth and moves with it""layperson ""zmog you f##ckign heritic son of a ***** that not what i've been brought up to understand , burn in the eternal fires of hell for daring to suggest something contrary to what i've been led to belive by my own eyes you crazy stupid son of a *****, your just trying to trick us with your new fangled mathematics""ad infinitum......."
9/29/2009,she chose astronaut for a reason you nitwit.what did you think she met by that?obviously the astronaut has been in space and saw the earth is round.duh!?please... stop dragging your delusional world in here and start facing the facts!
9/29/2009,"yeah something is totally wrong with my caldari ships. i can nicely stay at range while my amarr,minmatar and gallente friends are tackling in close while i just spam missiles from range. totally unfair for me to be safer than them.and i can jam from far away enough while my rapier, curse and arazu friends get hammered close range! also totally unfair and unbalanced.now i ask you ... maybe your style of flying doesnt fit caldari?well except for hamdrake, blasterox, torpwtfbbq raven, blasterokh?ah well.... you continue living in your dream world. i will stick to reality."
9/29/2009,"top damage on kms in gangs isn't everything, but let's look at the matter in more detail.if you want to top kms in gang settings, then the following are important:(a) range. if you need to mwd to optimal, your dps is jack. i see gallente underperforming in many gang on gang fights which do not start at zero. i see the artycane owning the higher dps ac fit every time in gang on gang fights when it comes to topping kms (and real utility too, because short range ships get worse as gang sizes go up; the tracking disability means little in gangs). i see amarr bcs and particularly bs being monsters.(b) gank oriented ships. this is where caldari generally don't have it, bar the raven which does not want to be in rr bs gangs (not a missile problem; the typhoon does preety damn well with torps) - most of the standard gank/tank ships are more tank oriented (where they do indeed win on ehp*dps calculation which is however more relevant solo). you'd still need to fit them like a total twerp to get outdamaged by a t1 fit hurricane with bc iii.(c) instant damage. means the less drone focus (bar sentries for the 125m3 ships) and the more gun focus (instant damage) gets to top the kms generally, while drones/missiles score worse due to travel time - you have a certain amount of lag before dps hits, which is not very relevant solo/small gang but is very relevant when there's ten ships shooting at one.obviously, caldari fail at two of these and so do gallente generally speaking, which is why i in practice rarely see these two topping kms, except in reasonably rare settings.(to be continued)"
9/29/2009,"on the other hand, caldari do have some strong points.- a good line of sniper ships or specialized range ships. they get underused because sniper gangs take more coordination to pull off then random rabble, however.- a good line of well tanked ships. this makes a number of caldari ships painful to face solo; the drake comes to mind with its preety awesome mix of dps and ehp with solid range on top. while tanking isn't a role in a gang if the high dps ships get primaried first (a mathematically provable fact but only assuming high dps ships get primaried first), the dps/ehp balance is relevant in solo/small (meaning <5 people) gang settings.- best ew ships & best ew. it's really no discussion. if i'm out soloing in a bc, and i see a gang with a blackbird and two random cruisers, i will basically avoid it unless i suspect they're stupid for some reason. if i see the same gang with a bellicose, i warp in and laugh a little inside. falcon is mean, but not op, even after the nerf. rook is downright awesome. scorpion is a nasty ship as well, despite the fact that 95% of the people i killed were using it wrong (the remaining 5% i didn't kill... heh).- torps which are awesome. unfortunately, raven is a shield tank, and shield rr gangs... well, they're slightly problematic.amarr i won't discuss, because once you get to bc, sniper hac and bs gangs, they are the correct (tm) choice. seriously.there's a few reasons why gallente are reasonably popular when it comes to the old, experienced pvp-er who likes solo/small gang:(a) they do well for solo / very small gangs given the slot layouts, and the fact that a lot of damage being non-instant (due to range, drone travel times and such) is not a big concern in the scenarios.(b) slaveset can compensate for a lot of their disabilities given ehp, and you will find veterans using pirate implants and hardwirings a lot, provided this is low-sec we're talking about. shield buffer tanks have no such option to boost pure ehp (the snakeset is the correct choice for shield buffer ships, but i've only seen one drake use it - one from the russian all different corp names gang. they do know how to fit ships correctly.).(c) in the old days, if you wanted to solo gallente was optimal. this leads to a lot of people who are used to flying them, know their ins and outs, and like the ships, even if i'd argue that a lot of their ships actually is not nearly as good as the forum lore says. not everyone flies optimal ships however... else 90% of eve would be flying a curse with hg snakes.(d) they're gank oriented, largely. gank ships have one advantage over tank ships for 1v1 combat assuming equal dps/ehp balance: they might kill the target sooner leading to less time to bring in reinforcements. if you solo a lot, this is a prized trait.largely the same for minmatar, except they trade raw dps for more range, and they tend to trade a bit of ehp for a bit of speed/agility over gallente, producing a altogether more favourable mix for solo then gallente, imo, although it's something we could debate on. i personally switched to minmatar after rolling a gallente character because the rifter is awesome and looks 11ty billions better then a tristan. so, are caldari underpowered? no, not really. what they could use is adjustments to small ships and in some part t1 cruisers, a fix to rockets and to a extent lights to go with the small ship adjustment, and reducing the fittings of shield transfers.a overall boost of any sort would leave a lot of the ships flat out overpowered. if caldari became the 'top damage dealer' race (talking about sub-bs ships here, since the raven certainly, despite it's disability to participate in rrbs gangs, doesn't have this problem), then tank would have to go seriously down, and range could use looking at. else you'd get absurdly monstrous ships."
9/29/2009,"i don't give a damn crap what ccp has to say about this subject. doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. please try to convince me cause i don't see the point of this.the solution presented doesn't make sense. have ccp create a formation function to dictate the range when you warp and whats the distance between all your ships and it will ""probably"" make sense or even make poeople in the fleet know where you are and it will make sense too. but to have cloaking intact when a ship collide, nope. no way.i can understand today since theres no of of warping in formation and no formal way of using range of warping and such (when using warp squad of course) that would make sense but to remove the collision when in fleet."
9/29/2009,no.. this takes all the skill out of stealth bombing gangs.
9/29/2009,"it used to be that ships using the covops cloak ii they didn't uncloak each other, and we have had no explanation to why they implemented the uncloak ""feature"".agreed! but only for and between ships using the covops cloak and that are in same fleet.a hostile should be able to uncloak me if he / his drones comes within 2 500m.and i should be hindered from re-cloaking if another (friendly or hostile) ship or drone etc is within 2.500m or i'm targeted."
9/29/2009,"think if we refrain from convincing you and proceed with convincing ccp we'll get more places, right ?"
9/29/2009,"heh, fully skilled in thermodynamics but never use it because the button is too small and can't remember all the hotkeys."
9/29/2009,"why does everyone say that?do you all just fly around in interceptors, or can you completely disregard the passing of time at will?flying a freighter from amarr to jita is anything but quick. i'm not saying it needs to be faster, but it sure isn't too fast.--as for the topic: don't like it either. doesn't feel right, imo."
9/29/2009,first of all freighters shouldnt be fast. webbing the ship helps (hello teamwork!).and yes i regularly do 50-60jump trips with my freighter.
9/29/2009,"actually i normally move cargo in a prowler (since i am normally moving very small items) - so yes, it feels considerably faster to me than someone in a freighter. that feeling of speed is very subjective based on our normal modes of play.the point is, eve doesn't need to feel smaller."
9/29/2009,not supported.
9/29/2009,"i never said they should be. just that they aren't.yeah, nice idea, but actually rather useless unless you mean to reduce risk (always good).i once timed flying through a 70au system - the actual flight in warp took by far longer than going into warp - even though that takes almost a minute.no reason to waste another ones time unless it's really important/valuable cargo.if fleets could increase warp speed, that would be more interesting..."
9/29/2009,"there is such a load of consequences that i'm not even going to list them.travel in eve is as it stand fast enough (read just fine), it might be boring but it keeps the idea around that this takes place in a galaxy.you should have gone back to before revelations where you could just as well autopilot anywhere in high-sec because it didn't matter if you flew or autopiloted, although the 15 km bookmark beyond a gate sped travel up of course."
9/29/2009,"actually, if anything, fleets should align and warp at the speed of their slowest ship, to maintain fleet coherency."
9/29/2009,"this is a troll right?this has to be a troll. . . . . . . . . .yep, this is a troll, well thought out troll, but a troll nonetheless."
9/29/2009,bahaha. so awesome.so supporting this idea because of how stupid it is.
9/29/2009,i propose that the pos shield acts exactly like a bubble; everywhere.this will lead to many cowards dying appropriately.
9/29/2009,"sounds great, would definitely get me more carrier kills."
9/29/2009,"for those of us who have no freaking clue what you're trying to say, could you maybe elaborate a little?"
9/29/2009,"i think what he's trying to say is that in addition to keeping you protected from getting locked by other ships, the bubble also keeps you from warping in and out of the pos without leaving the bubble first."
9/29/2009,a bubble in 0.0 is this thing which when anchored acts literally as an area of effect warp scrambler. nothing except tech 3 ships can warp when inside a bubble.a pos shield is emitted by a pos which provides a protection shield from anyone when inside it. this means you can warp in and out of a pos shield and be perfectly safe. nothing can do damage to you.i think this is bad. you should fall out of warp outside the bubble. fly into the shields for protection. you also need to fly out of the shields in order to get out. exception being the appropriate tech 3 subsystem.this would make it impossible for ships to stay in the pos and expect to be safe.
9/29/2009,i propose you stop proposing ideas.
9/29/2009,this makes perfect sense to me. supported.
9/29/2009,and your reasoning behind this? for me the current pos bubbles are perfectly fine.
9/29/2009,"domain names pretty much work the same in all systems. they have to, it's the only way you can set a standard so that all domain name servers can access and recognize all the other servers out there. domain name systems have to all be based on the same underlying principles; otherwise, the systems couldn't communicate. now, ccp may have some internal setups on stuff that may be specific to their system, but the underlying basis of how aliases, subdomains and domains work has to all be the same as any other system.i didn't claim to be an expert. show's how good your reading comprehension skills are.i just said i have experience with it and know how it basically works seeing as i've done similar things and have run multiple domains and subdomains on the same server."
9/29/2009,thank you so very much for proving my case.i suggest you go read up on your dns/bind/web hosting administrative practices before you come back.dns is only one part of the whole... there is much more to it than just pointing a domain name to a location/server.the api server is very likely (and i hope to hell it is) on a different server... but all of us even then have no bloody idea how they have it all mapped out.. they likely have all kinds of things going on.subdomains don't necessarily map to the same server...and firewalls are smart enough to tell the difference... at least the good ones. not to mention certain security issues when crossing server barriers must be taken into account.. such as ssl certs.and i seriously doubt ccp will lift a finger for a little indulgence because your wanting to frak around on the job.
9/29/2009,"i understand their can be underpinnings that make things a bit more complicated. sorry, i wasn't being literal with the 15 minutes; just sorta using an ""expression"".i still can't believe it is that difficult. usually if you point another domain name to something, it just takes on the structure.like my personal website. godaddy hosts both of my domains, which point to an outside server (byethost.net hosting)."
9/29/2009,"your asking them to ""mask"" the literal idenity of a secured api server with the public idenity of an another.dns is nothing more than a recursive referencing system that ""points"" to ip address's via a methodology i wont get into right now.dns is the easy part.the hard part is the functionality in which you wish to use that is not under that id.afaik the only way to achieve what you want is to literally move the server into the realm of eveonline.com.when your dealing with different ""boxes"" as far as physical goes... you run into complications when you try to merge the too.for example...myalliance.com (example) has a few subdomain'sforums.myalliance.com is mapped to a directory... easy right?thing is the database that drives the boards is mapped somewhere else.... and its on a different zip code physically speaking.. even a different backbone.if you where using data from that database to a local machine you'd see it's a different ""hostname"" than the main one... none of the 2 are related and your firewall could potentially block either or.your proposed solution is to remap it... fine... that sounds easier than it is... so if i put ""forumsdb.myalliance.com"" and point it to ""hostname"" of the database would it work?no... because the database's security systems would deny access due to invalid identification because its designed to listen to a specific server.oh sure it can be reprogrammed... but then you leave potential open doors in the security sense and it just gets bloody complicated in a hell of a hurry.that's just one pitfall.keep in mind the assumption of all servers being in the same place 9 times out of 10 is false.most companies who have critical assets tend to keep them offsite in a isolated area for purposes of uninterrupted operations... and that system could be multiple servers or a cluster of servers all doing specific tasks that have nothing to do with the main web server here at eveonline.com.the provider i work with has a different outsourced company that maintains a server farm for all databases for example.so i apologize if i was a bit harsh... im so used to slapping people around who claim they know as opposed to the ones who really know... at least your nice enough to ask why as opposed to denial.i'm sure ccp would have a authoritative answer on the matter but like it or not... this issue is very minor... if its an issue at all... which it isn't."
9/29/2009,"this is where i'm confused. why do you say that?like i gave with the example of my webpage, i have two domains that point to the same location.godaddy hosts my domains, and i input dns information that points to my webhost server.i register those domains in cpanel and byethost knows that when godaddy redirects to my webhost what webpage to pull up. if i say www.serysoft.com/blog.php or www.r-burke.com/blog.php, i get the same page. so why can't they simply ""point"" eveonline.com to exactly the same thing as eve-online.com.more or less, why are they only allowing eveonline.com to mirror certain parts of eve-online.com in the first place. what is the ultimate motive to doing that? if you can do it to the forums, why not just let eveonline.com point to the whole thing? if you just break it down to the domain name level, there can't be security issues."
9/29/2009,"did you even read my whole post or just that one bit?your assuming everything is on one single server.it's sure as hell not! that much i can guarantee.your dealing with the virtual aspect but you keep leaving out the ""physical aspect"".if it was all in one place then it would be easy to deal with.. but it's not.for all i know the api system is likely integrated with the game cluster servers itself... if not a subsection of it (as they have turned it off every so often)the portal in which we gather api is like its own server at that rate.it's not unsual for large systems to be broken down physically into clusters of physical boxes.top that off with the fact that i did say that even if you map the dns to point to a specific location you cant get around the authentication issue.and your log in credentials aren't enough... there are hidden variables that are likely involved that are critical to security!and if you didn't read all of that... then at least get this.with all due respect...we have no ####ing idea how its all laid out... and your request is likely going to get ignored because its just trivial at best. there are far more pressing matters to resolve right now.we can make conjectures and attempt to make conclusions but with no valid proof... there's only the ""way things work"" at best.and i think i'm done debating this one.:)"
9/29/2009,:/this post was easier to understand than your original one.i get it now. sucks you had to end it the way you did.i was liking you for a minute there.
9/29/2009,i'm surprised you liked it for this long.and the fact you didn't understand the first one speaks quite a bit about your true experience.i'm not a big expert on such things but i did learn a-lot about dns (heck i did it manually by hand in raw format (command line ftw!).i'm sorry if your offended but when your like me and you have to deal with all the kids that think they know it all it tends to get a little old real quick.with that... i wish you well...o7
9/29/2009,i'd like to see tracking introduced to the gateguns.i sat on a lowsec to nullsec gate in my af having a nice little chat with a red inty about the fight we were both about to jump into.it would be nice if i could have shot him before we jumped.
9/29/2009,just add tracking and sig radius factors to gate guns.forcing pirates to fly bs in order to pirate is...silly
9/29/2009,well how bad should the tracking of sentries be?because making it bad enough so your tackled cruiser/frig isnt getting toasted will be a huge nerf. :)
9/29/2009,"as a jump freighter pilot for a group of low sec pirates i often have to fill 10 or more orders for them, each wanting different ships and many mods, often these mods are the same, and with the only way for me to sort these out into different groups being the gereral freight container it becomes frustrating, the size of this container allows me to only fit two in my jump freighter. so now i only have 3 sections which to sort this stuff out.i propose the creation of an item along the lines of shrink wrap like they use to budle freight these days, that i can apply to a group of selected items which bundles them together into a container the size of their total m3. i can then name this for easy sorting.this simple item would make my life alot easier, having to write down lists and all that bs."
9/29/2009,i do have a freigher (not the jump freighter) and its hell. i support this.
9/29/2009,maybe check this thread:
9/29/2009,everything that brings more ka-boom into hisec is good.
9/29/2009,"yeah, just let us shoot 'em already."
9/29/2009,"for the millionth time, i support this. more pvp in high sec for everyone and more smacktalk too :)i would just activate a mission, fit a pvp ship and wait till my victim(salvager) comes in. all prepared for pvp of course just to see the smacktalk."
9/29/2009,"defender launches should be fire-&-forget, have the same rof of rockets, and if a missile pops with active defenders in space they retarget the next available missile until their 'fuel' depletes.there should also be gun-based defensive systems with extremely high rates of fire, high tracking and long range but tie up a turret slot (because not all ships have an available missile bay).both should engage drones if no missiles are directed at the ship."
9/29/2009,"simple fix: always on constant passive scanning system (like that old ugly half-sphere we used to have, but up to 14.~ au in size).it's purely passive so hardly accurate. all it gives you is a 'ship' roughly x-distance away (the further away the larger the deviation up to an au or more). it won't tell you what kind of ship until they're within 1/2 au. the smaller the ship the longer it takes the passive sensors to detect it at all. if a recon decloaks long enough to throw a probe and recloaks the sensors won't ever see it.if you want more info you have to open up the scanner and actively 'ping' local space. this sends out a more accurate pulse of energy that returns shiptype information but the range still has a broad deviation at longer distances... but it *also* quite effectively indicates where you are and what you're flying. not so much that they get a free warp-to, but gives them a darn good idea where to throw their probes and what to look for.the passive full-time scanner would not see anything but ships, period. no pos, no wrecks, no probes. it would just tell you 'ship' has appeared on long range scan at x-distance in roughly that direction on a 45-60 degree arc (wider at longer ranges).there, fixed.now you'll always have a warning of a new contact. what they're in, or what they intend, you haven't a clue... and the smaller the ship the longer your passive system will have to look to see it."

9/29/2009,"i'm not going to fanfest, others are. they could be asking questions, but it is hard to know what the csm questions should be and if there are any worth using the opportunity to ask, when we don't even get to see the minutes.and thats not even taking into consideration the forum discussion of the minutes. who does not remember the infamous ""40%"" quote from one of those minutes, and all the talk that spawned.there were lots of things that could have been debated, so it won't be necessary to waste time with them at fanfest - or at least you would have been far better prepared to go in depth with them if they have been opened up on the forum first.what's the whole point of it, if it is just going to be some closed counsil that doesn't give the feedback people need?has it has become a empty shell that goes through the motions, but noone involved, neither csm or ccp, really care one bit and certainly don't care to inform the general public?i am at lack for the english equivalent, but the danish readers might know what i mean when i ask: er det g<U+FFFD>et hen og blevet en syltekrukke?csm used to be trumpeted as a democratic step forward and unique among mmo's for improving the player-dev information flow, something important and to be applauded.the current state is giving the impression of slacking and not caring.i think you are right about noone caring about the posts in this section of the forum. it is quite likely assumed that anyone with anything worthwhile to say is already directly connected to either a ccp'er or a csm delegate.and 'assembly hall' is looking more and more like features and ideas, with the difference that most people have learned to slap [proposal], [idea] or [issue] on their horse to make it look official.i can just note that today, tuesday during downtime, they have still not been posted and the thing kicks off on thursday, less than 48h from now."

9/29/2009,wondered if it would be now possible to get rid of this annoying thing?
9/29/2009,sorry if this was talked in other thread i probably missed but could someone re-direct me or write a few lines about how csm was involved in sovereigtny revamp process? what was the role of csm and what objections and concerns did they rise?
9/29/2009,"and exactly how do you propose ccp do that?gold spammers plague nearly every mmo in existence. if you find a reasonable and rational way of thwarting them, let us know."

9/30/2009,"just bring them in-line with light missiles and make their base damage half that of the bigger ham cousins, that is a doubling of current damage (lights have 1/2 the damage of heavies). that way they will still be iffy against small fast targets but brutal when something is larger, tackled or painted, just like the ham's and torpedo's.no amount of explosion velocity will make them worth a damn against non-frig targets so that is the wrong way to go if you ask me. it is not rocket science (harr, harr. harr, i am so clever)"

9/30/2009,"yes please!great feature, managing bookmarks in containers is a pain."
9/30/2009,"actually, bookmarks are stored server side. it's just the bookmark folders that are stored on the client.but thanks for raising the feature request. the ship fittings savings was awesome. even if it takes a year for something like this, it'd still be great."
9/30/2009,"no.it would be far to easy to move around, especially in a fleet environment. would undermine the whole idea of covops and scouts, not to mention make exploration utterly trivial (everyone knowing where everything is the second it is probed down).make a central depository (office or hq) where bookmarks can be entered into a shared folder. allows for rapid dissemination of locations, removes the need for the cans'o'doom but most importantly it does so without obsoleting the roles of scouts and making fleet warp-ins a matter of waiting for bookmark to appear on screen.sorry for the hardships you face in w-space, but it is pretty much what it said on the tin. out there life is supposed to be hard."

9/30/2009,"what is nos suppose to do exactly if it's not suppose to counter neuts?also, i don't subscribe to the idea that cap injectors are counters to neuts, cap injectors are a requirement for active tanking (yet another reason why it sucks). fly an active tanking ship without an injector in pvp and even without getting neuted, you'll die very quickly. it also doesn't scale well (lol/mids/grid)."

9/30/2009,"if the tempest becomes the sniper, what becomes of the maelstrom? i mean, people prefer the megathron even though the hyperion is *better*. also, are you sure you want 30 seconds rof cycle time?i don't want an apoc clone, but messing with fall off is problematic. right now, you can get 150km fall off on the vargur/macherial on sisi because of the changes to tracking enhancers. because the fall off number is so big, and so many ships have bonuses to it, combined that it's actually normally a pretty ****ty mechanic (hit quality drops as well as hit chance, so your alpha is much less in fall off) - i decided to leave it alone. optimal range for ac's i still believe is the best solution, the problem with it really is that too many pilots have fall off tinted glasses. it works for frigs and cruisers because you can keep at fall off against anything that out damages you, and move into optimal against anything that has better range than you. with battleships, it's infeasible to be in more than two places at once and far more valuable having a defined radius in which your weapon system is superior."
9/30/2009,i propose a change to mining drones of all types at present they fly to a rock orbit at there optimal range for mining! now i propose that the drones need to be changed to work like sentry drones base range of 15km and using skills implants and gang bonuses gain the same bonuses as lasers and maybe balance out there old flight time with a few seconds extra cycle time this will eliminate lag when there is a fleet of miners no extra moving objects allow the bigger rocks to be mined by drones as currently when a rock's radius is over the optimal range of drone it is hit and miss as to weather the drones will mine or not any thoughts on this

9/30/2009,at least double amount for fast learning
9/30/2009,i would like to say shut up. 8 days and i havent hit 500 thousand sp yet. and im doing fine. i mine i go pvp with my clan (and im no help at all. pewpew) and i have fun. with 1 million sp i would not even need a frigate to start with and id be trolling around low sec with the rest of the 1 million sp noobs. i like the idea of raising the speed noobs train and tapering it off. maybe just raise it a bit more and taper it off slowly. not up to 6x though. jeez. then my skills would be worthless. hell why not make it so everybody trains a little faster. and provide a timeline thing so you can figure out how to get to your goal better. im trying to do alot of things and the ingame help and hints and menus are confusing and sometimes not helpful at all. but thats a different story. you play too much wow if you think noobs getting 1mil sp is at all reasonable. and thats from a noob.
9/30/2009,download evemon; it is awesome for planning out your skill training.
9/30/2009,wow really? i didnt bother to check and see if there were actualy a program for it. id like one in the game sorta but that will work. thank you.
9/30/2009,"let's give new players a jump start with sp!first, we can put out a new skill set: learning skills. these could raise your attributes for each level. we could have two skills for each attribute, even! this could double the speed you learn at! training the basic skill to level 5 in order to train the advanced skill would be too much, though, so make level 4 the prereq.hmm.... that's not enough. how about we give every new player a vast amount of skill points to start out with, something like 800,000 sp. no, wait, we should let them assign it any way they want. how about instead for the first month or so we give them double the training speed. yes, double!my creative wheels are spinning now. that's not enough. these new players might have attributes that aren't suited for what they find out they want to do in the game. let's let them choose the attributes, too! new players should at least get a couple chance to do this. we could call it neural remapping!tl;dr: trading rl money for skill points is fail, but the devs have already done quite a bit to allow new players to train faster and get skills faster."
9/30/2009,"actually, if you consider the shape of many other haulers in the game, unless there is some secret future technology of which i am unaware, the iteron v is very unrealistically designed.let me give a simple reason to start with.. it needs too much metal!imagine a hypothetical object 100m long, 1 m wide, and 1 m tall.this has a total volume of 100m3.it will also require 100m+100m+1m+1m of surface area or metal to clad the structure. so that is 202 square metres.instead let us create the perfect cube which would each have a facet of 33.67 square metres (adding to a total of 202 square metres). each square would be 5.8m tall and 5.8m wide.so instead of having a total volume of 100m3. using the same amount of surface area, we could have a total volume of 5.8 x 5.8 x 5.8 = 195m3 of volume.so a hauling ship will always tend to veer towards being boxlike. obviously aesthetic preferences and the mechanical details may change the ship design a bit, but that doenst alter the illogicality of the ship design.plus, imagine a station docking bay. what is the most obvious shape for a station docking bay. a massively long thin bay, or just a massive cuboid structure so a wide variety of ships could fit in...but what am i saying, the itty v is an internet spaceship, as long as it looks cool and it looks belieavable for what it does, its all good"
9/30/2009,"your math is wrong*. to encompass a volume which is 100m x 1m x 1m requires 4 'sides' each 100m x 1m and 2 'ends' each 1m x 1m, yes?. that is 402 square meters of materials.and because your first math was wrong*, this portion also ends up wrong. to still use only 402m2 of materials, each panel of the cube can be 8.1853m x 8.1853m (66.99m2) and give a total interior volume of 548.347 cubic meters.*as i suck at math, i'm probably also wrong. i guess i'd rather see the iteron look like a smaller version of the obelisk."
9/30/2009,"make it bubble wrap, allow it to be popped, and i will never leave a station again."

9/30/2009,"yep, i've wanted something like this for a long time."
9/30/2009,amen!!!excellent idea...
9/30/2009,"excellent idea, have ran into this situation many times forcing me to fly another 2-3 jumps just to get cans to organize it around a bit."
9/30/2009,"definitely!but don't confuse it with repackaging items. something like right-click > shrinkwrap items or right-click > box items would be better. using the word package would be pad due to confusing it with repackaging, i think."
9/30/2009,"while i am all for neat hangars wouldn't it make a lot more sense to double the number of hangar divisions. a wrapped item cannot be accessed unless the entire bundle is opened, so you are essentially asking for a long-term storage solution that does not involve office rentals.correct me if i am wrong, but isn't one of the significant differences between the wrap and cans that the wrap can't be scanned?i am sure the suicide gankers on the hub-gates would shed a tear if all haulers were using x-ray proof cargo bays.will the player made label allow you to see exactly what is inside? if not, they should not be trade-able to avoid the obvious scam potential."
9/30/2009,i don't like this idea the way it is worded right now it is just what scammers need to scam thru contracts or sales
9/30/2009,"a simple solution to the scamming issue is to make wrapped packages non-contractable. if you wanted to contract stuff for another person to move, you would use a courier contract in the first place. this seems like it would be more for moving personal items or items for friends/corporations, where they could just direct trade you a wrapped package."
9/30/2009,"you see what is inside of these packs, dont worry about the suicide gankers."
9/30/2009,zmog gonna train for min bs now.please dont get it changed yet.cause i reallly wanna fly a bs with double damage bonus on capless guns.
9/30/2009,"poor troll or legitimate noob? i'm undecided.also this thread doesn't serve so much of a purpose anymore, i'll keep watching the changes being made. right now there's a few things missing (such as extra falloff on acs, fusion being top damage, the muninn is still terrible), but i won't bother making a thread for any of it until ccp puts this stuff on tq."
9/30/2009,i think i would prefer to just scrap the whole csm rather than do away with term limits. while i am not advocating scrapping the csm system now i am awfully close to it. it just seems to be a way for the big alliances to get advanced intel on what is coming down the dev pipeline. i don't believe that nda slows them for 5 seconds. they are just a lot more sophisticated than you know who was.my .02 isk.not supported.

9/30/2009,supported.
9/30/2009,lets assume we follow your suggestion and bump the blasters. with the suggested changes to the vindicator it would end up with what? 2000-2200 dps?are you nuts? and 6 minutes sustained fire is like firing permanently. because everytime when you change targets and move into range the cap has time to recover a bit and make that period longer. also does your calculation take cap boosters into account?in general i have to say ... range boost maybe..... 50% dps boost no way even with the cap penalties thats over the top.
9/30/2009,i would support increasing optimal and reducing cap usage a bit.

9/30/2009,"nuts no cause gal weapons uses cap. take a neuter and the gal weapons are useluess. seems like a good thing to me. minnie don't even use cap and same goes with missiles. so in other words you can or have more chance of using more defense modules instead of a mod for your cap since some people use a cap mod in order to have more life for their weapons.i like that change. but i have to say, with that amount of damage, reduce fall off and don't touch optimal. this way its still the ""shotgun"" up close and getting very very personal with your victim."
9/30/2009,"blasters need fixing, but not in the way ""i'm down"" wants to."

9/30/2009,thank you for proving it would be unbalanced.
9/30/2009,"yes, inside of 6km opitmal, it's harshly imbalanced, which is the point of blasters. it's also terribly cap inefficient. if you go past 6km optimal, damage starts to decline rapidly. i'm not sure how many fights you have been in inside of 6km, i've not had that pleasure often enough.tracking disruptors, energy neuts, range, and speed are all great counters to blaster megas."
9/30/2009,"good analysis, supported."
9/30/2009,"just saying but 50% increase does not mean 1.5x, as you have to remember the damage boosts on skills do not stack well.so likely the dps would be in the range of 1200 not 1500.in support of more optimal and a tad more dps"

9/30/2009,"in general a realy speced gank mega should be able to reach 2k dps(during overheat), but this is more a problem of the damage rigs(unstack them with damagemods and we will see a lot more options instead off trimarks on anything).the 1430 dps from my mega atm(including max skills and imps, it hits nearly 1.6k during overheating) feel just a bit to weak with the 93k ehp buffer it got against resonalbe fitted bs. it is to weak to gank a simlar fitted gedon(ehp advantage by the extra low mostly make the diffrence here) or a dualrep hype(what was a bit easier with 90% webs, even if it is down to around 30 structure). in general 50% is to much(fix damage rigs instead ffs) and a proper number would be more like 15-20%.i disagree on the range change, the problem is not range, it is effectiveness at the given range. core problem here is the weak web(outside of rr gangs or throw away gang damagedealers), that stops you to apply all your damage and negate range issues(once you get your target webbed). even without a dps a boost, with a working web the blaster ships would be at least as good as pre qr. actualy a bit better since more people prefere close range now instead of flying nano ships, even if i mostly enjoied the kitting game against them. also i compleetly disagree here null is fine(a bit to good actualy with bs sized neutrons), the problem is the performance once you get into web range, not the performance out of it(and be shure it is a lot better than pre qr atm and eats any kind of cruiser hull at 20km alive allready with the reduced speeds). even if it would be a option, it doesn<U+FFFD>t fix the range issues within web range and is fare to powerfull out of web range(bs neutrons)."
9/30/2009,well maru ka'ge might be if they stop failing at pvp.anyway ... people will be able to afford vindicator and then you suddenly got something that eats anything out there alive. if the blaster changes as proposed here go live you would nerf the vindicator again for balance.

9/30/2009,"hello all,just a quick few words, i am not a moan and a complete noob. there we go ok, besides hotkeys there, in my eyes an issue with the overheat rack buttons and the little overheat single module buttons, and its the size of the buttons. seriously, sometimes in a ""omg wtf situation"" that button being so small is very annoying and actually takes some of your concentration away to maneuver your way to click it without ****in' it up. another thing, ok you overload rack and the little button doesent turn green instantly if there is one of your modules in a pre cycle, it would be better if the overload rack button would flash green telling you its awaiting the end of your mod cycles and is ready to overheat and then turn solid green.for the whole button problem, i can not really suggest another way of making it easier to click apart from making them slightly bigger.for individual modules, there should be a bigger sticky out activation button at the top, rather than having it molded into the top and being so small, i have on some occasions turned a module off because of the precision needed and i just don't have time.i know some people out there are just going to say, go away, you just suck and cant click it right, you shouldn't have to master clicking a dinky button because in my opinion, its a little bit of a gui flaw.have not been on the test server recently so unsure if there is any changes,thanks for reading,gib(trolls will be mails spammed in game)"

9/30/2009,"no, actually. wow has more people playing than eve because wow dumbed it down enough to appeal to the masses. ccp did not take shortcuts with their game and destroy it just for the sake of getting more subscriptions. hence, smaller player base, but more fun game, at least for those of us that like it. for those that don't.... well, there's always wow."

9/30/2009,"i am guessing that you have not taken basic game theory, have you?eve does well because it appeals to people outside the wow playerbase. if it altered to compete directly with wow, it would die a horrible death, just like all the other 'wow killers' out there."
9/30/2009,"1. i was drunk.2. even while drunk i was being sarcastic. i mis-typed on account of laughing, not the vodka. ;p"
9/30/2009,don't drink and post efrim.:)
9/30/2009,"lol, i just have to point out that a persons iq have nothing to do with social skills. as if i insult you for a stupid opinion. according to your statement it means i have low iq? mind clarify this just a little. and for the record, the higher iq a person have, the less social skill they tend to have.so; are you saying that drake is a genius? and to the topic, i think buying all sp associated with a certificate is not a good id<U+FFFD>a. like core competency elite. that's huge amount of sp's involved. core fitting elite is usually only associated with t2 bs and/or dread pilots due to the ""adv weapon upgrades lvl5"" requirement. and i may also point to the character bazaar where you can buy chars only to be called ""ebay"" when you actually try to do something with them.so, not supported. not at all."
9/30/2009,nice!o7
9/30/2009,"not supported.if i had to go uphill, in the snow, both ways, in the dead of winter, barefoot, three times now, then so should all the new people."
9/30/2009,"remove clone upgrading every time after pod lost. its not good ""isk sink"" - clones cheap. its really griefing when u lose - something like bs 5 or even cap. ship. for new player even 3-5 days lost in training is too much.its a game - u don't need punish ur players for every wrong move. (how many ""rage quit"" was due to this ""feature"") and for all who want post -> l2p. remember - more troubles and complexity for players - less ppls in eve = much less fun.ccp want more life in lowsec and 00? - pls remove some of barriers. if you have insurance you dont care much about t1 fit.pod with learning implants and ur skills... is something u want to keep safe.and while u can buy imps and clear ur mistake for not warping out fast (sometimes due to lag) - u cant solve problem with clone."
9/30/2009,"first of all, i can barely understand you. second of all. supported."
9/30/2009,"someone forgot to upgrade his clone. as to your points:-it's an isk sink.-it isn't griefing, but you thinking that it is, is very revealing.-the really new players won't lose anything, since the basic clone is free. older players really should know better. the actual loss is 5% from those skillpoints not covered by the clone, so unless you haven't upgraded in a long time, the loss isn't cripling.-in this game you do. as you said it's a game, so why are you taking it so seriously? no one is forcing you to play, so if you like the game to kiss your wounded ego to make it all better instead of telling you what a moron you where, this might not be the game for you. intelligence and effort should be and is rewarded while stupidity is punished. working as intended. remember - the game is complex by design and attracts people who like that. change that to cater to the lazy and stupid and you lose the people currently enjoying eve. i'm all for more people playing eve, but not at the expence of ruining the game. an acceptable way to correct this would be a reminder, when your medical clone doesn't cover your current sp or even a popup when you try to undock in such a scenario."
9/30/2009,"simple scenario.ganked in belt, poded.switched off comp and went to work.forgot about all that crap after workday. took industrial ship form hangar -> gate camp -> pod -> lost skill points.dont see anything funny."
9/30/2009,"well i think skill loss shouldnt be there , but something else like a death penalty ,which can be negated by paying isk for your clone. that would be much better than the current form."
9/30/2009,"clone upgrading is less about the isk loss and more about stations having medical. that's actually a very important factor in regions like curse which have a lot of stations while only a few have medical, and it forces a bit of centrality.i wouldn't mind, however, having some sort of warning show up. i.e. one warning category for docking at a station with medical and an out-of-date clone, another for docking at one with a clone that will be out of date at the end of the current training queue."
9/30/2009,lesson learned:check your clone before undocking!
9/30/2009,"no doubt the current system could use improvements. a warning label somewhere informing you that your clone is outdated, perhaps.however:it's not supposed to be funny. a good game isn't just joy and fun. with no losses, there is no win.i'd suggest being able to pay in advance. would make more sense, imo."
9/30/2009,if you take the fact that no warning is given when your clone is not upgraded and you can go outside of a pos and because of that the player loses sp. and if one of the consequences is the player quitting everything and goes away from eve then yes there is a problem.either remove the whole upgrade clone thing or don't allow to undock if your clone is not upgraded if you ask me. one of the other i don't care.
9/30/2009,its not a lesson that could help you in your life. you always checking your brains before leaving house?scaming in jita helps in rl
9/30/2009,with the proliferation of applications such as eve mon... evehq... and other programs to let you know what you got going on sp... you utterly have no excuse.while i don't like the fact that it could excessively expensive if you get killed repeatedly... i can't support this.*damn efrim wth you come from? :)
9/30/2009,so i need to use 3d party program to avoid this? and u know - eve api was down at that time for some tournament.
9/30/2009,this is likening to getting into your car and not noticing you have a flat tire before causing potentially irreparable damage... or not checking the oil every so often... etc..etc..stop blaming the game for your short comings...man up... and get with the program.it's never been an issue for me... why should it be made a in-game problem?the api may have been down but the in-game skill sheet was still there and i kept an eye on that while it was down. what was your excuse?it's called enforcing good habits.and really... the isk invovled isn't really that much.i was told... check your clone periodically when skill up... make sure you replace your clone when you get podded.easy tasks... you forgot? you only have yourself to blame.if i had a nickle for every time some one came up here and whined about something they forgot... i'd be fricken rich.
9/30/2009,"its oil, flat tire etc, i can understand this and we all have more things to remember - like wife's birthday. why i should remember such stupid info like ""clone capacity"". just cuz some brilliant dev said - its cool it adds more realism? no in real world brains of clone dont have capacity and will never have such thing l2biology. i dont mind losing ship or pod or any reasonable amount of isk - but dont touch my sp. or do it in manner like t3 ships."
9/30/2009,then for lord's sake don't un-dock because you will lose it again!
9/30/2009,"dear god, why i dont see any sign of your love in drake draconis? may be he has no life and check his clone every 5 mins?"
9/30/2009,come on ... it is very simple:1. log in2. first thing after logging in: open character sheet and look at your clone grade and your total sp.3. if clone grade is less than your current sp. upgrade itdone. takes 10-20sif you live in lowsec/0.0 for a while you get used to it.i could support a warning on undock. but no autopayment.
9/30/2009,/me laughsare you really that foolish to think that? you must have had a sad sad time learning to play eve.try once a day nooblet.it's not rocket science... if you think it is... your in the wrong game.eve is not a kind game... but it's not hard to figure out either.stop being lazy... you'll figure it out eventually.
9/30/2009,"avoiding the skillpoint loss is so laughably simple that your whinepost makes no sense at all.the normal routine i do and which works:- when setting new skills check clone and current skillpoints.- when podded get new clone before undocking, always.- use evemon if you can't be bothered with step 1.with that said it might be a hassle to actually do it manually every single time and i would however like to seem something in a form of a clone contract which keeps updating your clone to the same level for a set number of clones and paying a sum of money in advance.however since this topic is a whine about it being ""this mechanic is so stuuuuupid!"" and not an actual proposal for the matter at hand i can not support it."
9/30/2009,- this game mechanic is by design. - this game mechanic serves a real purpose of making the opponent suffer loss. real loss makes real win possible. - this game mechanic allows players to make a choice. risk vs. reward. risk = possible podding and sp loss
9/30/2009,what will be eve without constant flow of *noobs* to shoot? answer - it will be desert with few very very attentive or intelligent ppls who will occasionly meet each other in jita.
9/30/2009,"somehow i feel that the game will be just fine with fewer people like you to whine about losing there sp's because they forgot to update there clone.....well that's what you really meant wasn't?can i has your stuff?seriously... the actual accidental ""i forgots to update my clone"" is rare enough as it is.and noobs your age (i assume unless your representing them and that's a stretch and a half) usually only lose a day or less of training.if your like me... well over a year and you forget... you deserve to be laughed at.and i will gladly be held accountable for said statement./thread"
9/30/2009,"i don't shoot noobs.noobs can also be attentive and intelligent, as opposed to your implicit assumption here that only older players are attentive and intelligent.the attentive and intelligent noobs won't quit simply because they forgot to upgrade their clone. the attentive and intelligent noobs paid attention during their tuts and whatnot and realized there was a clone to upgrade.actually, from my experience in game and on the forums, the unintelligent or unattentive people that complain about stuff like this quit relatively quickly, usually. so, what will eve be like? like it is, i guess. but that's just from my experience, i suppose.edit:oh, and fail for your response on wanting unintelligent or unattentive people to be able play eve enmasse and compete just as well as the others. eve would then be wow and our acronyms would be messed up."
9/30/2009,i recommend one (and only one) third party application - your brain.
9/30/2009,"4. delivery stats: filter the contracts by quantity successfully delivered. so we can weed out the couriers intended to be ganked long before reaching their destination (jita > amarr shuttle couriers, dead in niarja as an example)."
9/30/2009,"effing /signed!when might wings actually act like wings, and squadrons like squadrons? last time i checked, there was no way in hell a commander or even a captain could direct every man in a fleet engagement."
9/30/2009,no. you have to copy & paste the name of the missing item.oh obviously no improvement can be made. the quirks to copying bookmarks take so long to explain.while bookmark copies create database overhead.wow. so smart.
9/30/2009,"here is where your results are skewed. eve is a complex game of rock, paper, scissors in which there is no ship that cannot be topped one way or another.fitting a ship is about sacrifices. tackle is a sacrifice. i can say if you didn't need tackle in pvp there would be a bit of a difference in your findings. pick a ship. train it. each race has their ships that do certain things well. what you are effectively saying is make the exequeror comparable to the vexor in combat validity. if tackling required low slots you can guarantee caldari and shield minny ships would be the supreme rulers of your borked statistic lesson.drake is a drake, thorax is a thorax, tempest is a tempest, no need to change what these ships do for balance, instead skill one up and fly it. eve is open ended like that."
9/30/2009,"i don't usually do this, but a hearty ""i agree"" to this post. (i might recommend nerfing rook's damage output a bit since i'm not sure if cerberus has a viable role at the moment, but on the other hand, it's just awesome to fly...)"
9/30/2009,free bump for more people to laugh at op's idiocy. i fly caldari ships; they are just fine.
9/30/2009,somehow the csm supported this. i cant. this is crazy op. the idea that they bumpdecloak each other is what keeps their power from being so powerful.at most... i could say that a black ops ship on grid cloaked(or uncloaked if he's insane) who is able to operate a module(while cloaked) which gives that black ops pilot the ability to see his cloaked fleet members. who then communicates saying person x you're going to far left. nooo wrong left.
9/30/2009,"as all of us who have played eve for any significant period of time know, eve is greatly lacking in interesting enviroments. it's all just ships, stations, and floating rocks.as the mission recon part 3 proves, it is easily within the engine's limits to create specific backgrounds in an area. it also proves said enviroments can be programmed to have an effect on player ships.here are some of my proposals for ways for ccp to make all the spaces in eve a little more interesting.asteroid belts: somehow a little row of rocks isn't that interesting. by liberally placing say, a hundred large asteroids within a 100 km of the warp-in point, this could be fixed. these asteroids, if suitably massive, would greatly enhance the immersiveness of mining. additionally, maybe 2-3 asteroids moving at 400+ m/s with rarer minerals should orbit the belt, allowing players in faster ships to increase their profit at the expense of efficency. also adding covering the area in a minor speed decrease (10%-ish) under the pretense of ""asteroid dust"". the spherical design also allows mining to potentially be safer in losec if you invest the time in deep mining spots.ice belts: currently, these are better than asteroid belts, but by scattering the ice pieces in across a large spherical area would greatly enhance the immersiveness. adding mobile ice chunks of better quality would be good as well, but only going at 100m/s so that barges could follow. maybe cause 50-ish damage per minute to any ship moving faster than 500 m/s as a result of ""ice shards""stargates and stations: maybe add a few towers labeled ""concord monitoring station"" in empire or ""[alliance name here] listening post"" in 0.0. and adding random debris from the wrecks of unfortunate folks who shot the wrong person...plexes: when the complex spawns, maybe have a 10% chance that the whole complex is blanketed in a gas cloud / nebula that has an effect on ship characteristics within the complex, in addition to improving the overall appearance. examples: conducting gas: gas in the cloud conducts energy very well, increasing all damage by 10%. radioactive area: radiation from some cataclysmic cosmic event impairs crew functions, slowing the cycle time of all modules by 5%.random space: whenever a player enters a random area of a system (safespot, falls out of warp from low capacitor, ect ect) there's a 1% chance of a random cosmic feature, such as a 'rogue asteroid', a large gas cloud, or some other suitable object appearing in the area.in general, adding something other than the 20-ish overused normal backgrounds in favor of more interesting ones, like in wh space, would be excellent as well.feedback on this proposal would be nice."
9/30/2009,i like the random events idea. the moving asteroid probably isn't feasible imo.
9/30/2009,"i agree... losing fighters is too expensive and you will want kill mail for just the fighters. just make it a kill mail pack. example, after a big fight, x amount of hours you will get kill mail of how many fighters you lost of each type. that way, you don't get 25 kill mail for each fighter you lost. talk about a full inbox lol. as for drones, we could probably do the same thing but drones but are about a dime a dozen. heck, i can build hundreds, if not thousands of drones.brenteni use my alt for formes."
9/30/2009,"some guys here and there discussed about the local channel universal and they say we must remove it. i think that's a little bit too extreme.however, what i do advise is to change the local channel of jita:1- either remove it, see this as a last ditch attempt.2- either invoke some ""your chatting too fast! please wait x minute(s)"" system.3- your 'solution' here.discuss this [multiple items] thr- amarr navy omen -ead."
9/30/2009,"not sure what the problem is here, to be honest. i don't work in jita, but i work in other major hubs and there's contract spamming going on.if you see removing the local channel of jita a valid solution, then when you go to jita, minimize your local chat (or blink off). you not looking at it satisfies that problem.waiting a number of minutes is a bit extreme. this proposition tells me that you want to use the channel, but you don't want others posting in it to drown you out.solution in search of a problem, i think. i simply don't pay attention to local chat when in a trade hub and i'm not bothered by spammers. for those that want to see contracts, then can watch that channel, or various trade channels.isk seller spammers i see as a problem. good solution to that is right-click > report isk seller, which i've seen mentioned for at least a year now."
9/30/2009,"well maybe in the ""hub"" systems with more than 200 people in local charge a com service fee of 1 million isk, the fee could be implamented just like the one for pm's. this can help with isk spamers and contract spammers because most isk spamers are new accts and it will make scamming less profitable"
9/30/2009,"i really think ccp can afford one gm or employee of some kind to monitor jita 23/7 365 a year, so as soon as an isk spammer shows up they are banned."
9/30/2009,i think i will support this topic.
9/30/2009,"actually it would need to be at least 4 employees (and problably more realistically like 5 or 6), to cover all day long every day, unless you're assuming that one guy can work all day without ever needing a break (or a vacation, or a holiday, or a sick day).so...no. just report them and let the gm's deal with them."
9/30/2009,petition the ******s.[proposal] remove the local chat from jita.
9/30/2009,i do petition them but the process of doing so is clunky to say the least. i think ccp can stick somebody in jita 23/7 365 a year. it doesn't have to be one employee but i bet 4 could do it. one supervisor or lead and 3 to watch for isk spammers that gives the lead guy to cover time off from the others and the others cover his time off. this also supports ccp's mission of cutting the rmt types off at the knees.
9/30/2009,located the real problem for you. this is what they actually need to fix.should be: right click>report isk spam.yes i'm sure.done.
9/30/2009,"by the way, the lowsec pirate that posted a couple of replies above mine doesnt make any sense."
9/30/2009,"a: did it happen?b: what came of it?which topics were tabled? which were killed (destroyer changes, likely), which were escalated to ccp for review?"
9/30/2009,"<U+FEFF>[ 2009.09.27 16:13:32 ] zastrow j > im slightly hungover but im upsecond line on the raw log file - nice to see the professionalism and honesty of the csm hasn't been watered down at all, quite the opposite in fact.and xerox the destroyer changes were passed."
9/30/2009,it would be bloody nice if the iceland minutes where made available. :opstill haven't found them.
9/30/2009,"i remember when jason edwards used to post terrible ideas like this, now he is slowly turning into one of us. one of us."

9/30/2009,i support drake's proposal.

9/30/2009,"how hard or easy is it for ccp to create an educational tool for schools or for general public. like in elementary to high school or even college's and universities. i know that at the moment the universe of eveonline all the planets and moons belts etc. are all static. but if you could make a 2 or 3 starsystem for with moving planets moons of the sol system and have people in school learn about the solar system, or even different star types and lost objects like voyager probes, explore different theoretical ideas like wormholes in space, black holes, pulsars stars, the list can go on and on. any thing i missed out on?another great idea from,shadowburn"
9/30/2009,eve is a static 2d world for the most part.students would get more from this....
9/30/2009,"communicating that would be nice. completely ignoring everybody for a month is terribly unprofessional. from my understanding, somebody inside ccp is the hold-up on getting these published. can one of the csm delegates tell us whose inbox we need to start filling with daily reminders to get the minutes published?"
9/30/2009,"the csm is clearly abusing the priviledge of representing us.1) csm term limits as an issue was brought before the csm with only three supports. how was this representing the eve player base again?2) the current scanner mess (which is only going to get worse when local goes away in 0.0) which had over 1200 supports was not raised again. a comment ccp is rethinking it's position was all that was made. obviously with 1200+ supports this should be raised immediately and repeatedly.3) the csm clearly does not represent the majority of the eve player base. how many of you are 0.0 big alliance members again? what percentage of eve players actually go to 0.0?4) the current nda the csm is required to sign is a joke. either the csm represents the players or it represents ccp. which one is it? this is a clear conflict of interest. besides which it is probably violated in an organized matter by out of game communication by the big 0.0 alliances.5) the csm is prohibited from delving into certain topics, by who? ccp again.ccp either needs to one take the handcuffs off the csm so they can represent the player base or two end the current csm system (which seems to just be a way for ccp to white-wash it's problems)."
9/30/2009,"limiting wardecs from what they are now only promotes less destruction. so the new system needs to come into being where we promote more destruction... but we dont have alliance p with 1500 wardecs.at the same time. creating the situation where it is far more beneficial to be the 1 man corp instead of an alliance of 1000 uber carebears.lets say there was no wardecs. i bet there would be a giant alliance of carebears some middle sized ones. why dont they exist now? well you can have 1000 1man corps. 2mil each to wardec at minimum. so 2 billion isk to wardec those 1000 people. or you can have 1 alliance which costs 50mil to wardec. add on top of that... the 2billion isk stacks so it'd cost way way more.the new wardec system has to balance the system. it has to be legitimate to come together as carebears who have no interest in being wardecced at all. at the same time you need their ships to be dying. you need a system to allow for pos and cans and stuff to be destroyed. you need their operations to be disruptable. concord standing of the pilot, concord standing of the pilot's corp, the wardec aggressor's concord standing, and wardec corp's concord standing. add in that any aggressor corp/alliance will take concord hit(not necessarily anything as bad as suicide ganking... but not as easy as low sec. for destroying ships in highsec. free ship kills in low sec in terms of sec hit. the ammount of hit calculated around the 4 concord standings.killing anchored giant cans or pos or pos parts for that matter will be sec hit free.the sec hit changes arent activated proactively however. at the end of each week aka when you reup or get out. your average sec hit is applied. this happens if objectives havent been achieved. the objectives being the grievance."
9/30/2009,"like i wrote before and you better read my post again cause you really need to. if you wardec a corp and you don't attack, from my own knowledge (damn i'm smart) there is no destruction. you say theres less ???? thats not true. there not attacking...nothing, zero. nada, zip. the system right now doesn't promote anything at all. just full control on the aggressors. so in a way its more destruction on his side...if he attacks in the first place.some corps who wardecs love to ""promote"" fear to people and uses backstabing techniques if you ask me. just don't attack after a long time and once the victims think there never gonna attack you return with your regular ships (i never did btw) then thats when they attack. once you realize you did a dumb thing, you prepare for war and the wardecers hides for a time again and does the same thing again.not that its illegal cause i know its part of the game and mechanic but i really think this is not right. i mean if you wardec someone you should attack. sure its true that you can wait some time but not a week ??? thats exagerating."
9/30/2009,"so i can only speak about the csm2. we had some lengthy discussions with ccp while in iceland about how the sov mechanics could be improved. the discussions were very ""blue sky"" and ""brainstorming"" in nature but i think we did convey a general excitement about some of their ideas.issler"
9/30/2009,thank you for input.is there something more specific and recent? i was expecting there would be some entry on wiki like for other discussed matters.
9/30/2009,ishkurisnt the ishkur a subcapital assault ship? ya ishkur can do that.killing capitals just takes dps which comes from numbers. so yes. ishkur is this.well if we take the pheonix for example. even other capitals can avoid being hit by it. so obviously you want a sub-capital the size of a moon? hey ishkur is that.hell ya. ishkur is teh pwn.dude. ishkur is the ship for you.
9/30/2009,review destroyersi dunno. i figure they arent what they ought to be... but fear being overpowered epically is so likely. afterall have any of you seen an agony empire dessie gang? wow.tracking for fighters lost in combatalot of corps/alliances actually build and use public caps. that way at the end of the day. the pilot has no reimbursing to do.dont see why this needs a change.how was this passed tbh? is vuk lau really the only one seeing how overpowered this is?bombers are crazy op already... avalloc should know because goons just downed like 70 bs recently using them.
9/30/2009,are there any minutes for the directional scanner discussion?
9/30/2009,"hi erik,i'm sorry if i was unclear. let me try and make this a bit more understandable:do those two statements not constitue an inconsistency? mazz is basically telling us to go diaf because ccp isn't going to do a thing, whereas avalloc seems to suggest that ccp have indeed listened and changes are in fact already underway?!and there's even more conflicting information flying around. in fact just from mazzilliu alone we've had three versions:1. diaf, no changes will be made2. shut up, an overhaul of the entire scanning system is already underway3. that she's actually going to discuss this with ccp again??what i'm asking for is simply a clear answer: what is going on?a full reversal of the scanner change isn't necessary, we're not asking you to act like children and demand this of ccp again. but something needs to be done to make the scanner workable again, because at the moment the basic pvp game controls are suffering heavily from the 2 sec delay. (and if ccp is already planning to do something about it, please just tell us, and the threadnaughts won't have a reason to exist anymore!)there have been several good suggestions on how to do this. please present these to ccp as soon as you can, and ask them to do something about the issue. 1700+ posts, many of which come from pilots from some of the most well known and competent pvp alliances in eve, are asking you to be the liaison between players and ccp that the csm are meant to be.v"
9/30/2009,"mazzillu didn't say they weren't looking at options, just that going back to the old delayless scanner was not considered by ccp to be a viable option."
