2/1/2014,"ccp is constantly speaking of player-driven content. well, i say a prime opportunity for more of this is to let players come up with well thought out, well researched ship ideas, and submit them directly to ccp through some channels (either through csm, or create some form of means of sending in a design package (with basic design ideas) to ccp for approval (even if they have to tweak it)).i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
2/1/2014,let's get some more support rolling for this idea. it is something that will benefit every single eve player in some way or another.miners sell the minerals to industrialists to build them.industrialists sell the ones they build.haulers make money using them.and pirates get to gank them!i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
2/1/2014,"ccp bro wrote:ways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments, be it on a separate server or on tqi'd also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams, for instance a good prize for ""best new team"" for the new eden open. if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoiiit's not a question of players using the proper tools, it's players using improper tools that is stifling the events business.as you can see from this post, for example, players are starting to believe that they are not allowed, or not worthy, of creating their own events, because other players are using exclusive tools such as teleporting competitors, special clients with special targeting interfaces, and exclusive prizes that other event organisers can't publicly access as regular players.someone answering the question ""why don't you organise your own event?"" wrote:i cannot give away cool unique ccp in-game prizessomeone commenting on someone's pvp tournaments wrote:what makes your event better than the alliance tournament?to which the honest response was ""nothing"", and that person chose to not participate.someone on the subject of prizes wrote:i don't blindly trust the organiser of this event to pay out the prize money. i do trust that ccp will pay out the prizes they advertise.this is a problem, and there are several facets of it: one of the fundamental concepts of eve is the interaction between players, and the inclusion of the entire spectrum of outcomes of this interaction, from very good (making friends, making a corp together, co-operating to set up a starbase or outpost, etc.), to very bad (getting scammed, getting ganked or awoxed, etc.). but currently, the events business exists in a realm outside of that, wherein ccp arranges events that are not subject to the rules of trust. if a ccp employee used his ccp character to host a lottery event, it would completely suck all the customers from all new and potential lotteries, because ""what is the point of giving your money to a lottery that could be a scam when you can just play the ccp lottery which can't be a scam?"" the ""seal of approval"": this issue takes the form of certain events which are given access to special tools (special space, special tournament client), special prizes (unique ships), and special privileges (posting a thread that belongs in in-game events & gatherings into the much more trafficked general discussion, for example). this stamp of approval give certain events a competitive edge over other events, and other event organisers suffer from the decrease in spectators, sponsors, and participants.there is a solution to this problem, it is both very simple, and very painful for those who are benefiting from the current state of the events business. the solution is as follows:step 1: firstly, enforce the ideology of ""every player should play the game as a player"". when a ccp employee logs on to tranquility, it is either to correct an issue, such as responding to and rectifying quirks in the game engine (for example teleporting a titan that was bumped out of a pos shield at an impossible velocity and cannot be chased down by a player) or to play the game as a player, whereby they log on to their normal player character, and abide by the game mechanics like every other player. anything else results in catastrophe, such as the incident in the past with the ccp employee spawning t2 blueprints with his game master character to give his corporation a competitive advantage in the industry.teleporting regular players to special protected solar systems, or logging on to tranquility with a special client for the purpose of an event is, in my opinion, the very same thing as spawning t2 blueprints. you are giving one event organiser a competitive advantage in the events business.step 2: no exclusive prizes. (or, everyone gets exclusive prizes)this builds upon the same fundamental principle of eve: when you log on to tranquility and create your character, you are given the opportunity to achieve any one thing that any other player has achieved. if you want to fly that giant titan ship that you saw in a big alliance battle, you can have that. you can own the space, you can build that titan, you can train the skills. the events business is no different. you should have the opportunity right from the start to achieve the things that anyone else has achieved. but you don't. you can never build ""the largest pvp tournament in eve"", because the largest pvp tournament in eve is ""official"", and you are not ""official"".and that, as simple as it sounds, is the solution to fixing the events business. put everyone on a level playing field, and their accomplishments and failures will mean something. if a ccp employee wants to achieve the same things in his eve career, then that ccp employee must do it through the same means, opportunities, and restrictions as every other player: log on as a player, organise an event as a player, and become trusted as a player, the same conditional trust that applies to all players.or, the equally simple (but infinitely impractical), equally valid solution: make everyone a ""ccp employee"". let everyone design their own unique prizes, let everyone spawn special ships and log in with modified tournament clients, let everyone teleport each other to polaris space if they feel that regular space is too dangerous for their event. i think the former is preferable, and the latter would cause chaos. but they are both the same in terms of solving the problem, just with different consequences."

2/1/2014,"every single time alliance anything or bookmark anything comes up in a chat with ccp, someone on the csm says ""alliance bookmarks."" ccp definitely knows how much players want this and it's on the list."

2/1/2014,i don't see why that shouldn't work; endlessly buffing hi-sec's risk:reward and nerfing nullsec's has very successfully forced people out of null and into empire. why shouldn't restoring the economic balance be an effective tool to restore the population imbalance?
2/1/2014,from the last csm minutes. this section was not included. there was instead a statement saying that this section would be released after the new year.so where is it?
2/1/2014,"the statement said that it would be released after its contents were no longer nda'ed. that is still the case, unfortunately. i wish i could say more but you'll understand why i can't in due course."

2/2/2014,"i wholly support this idea, if it had jump capabilities. otherwise it's just easier to use a jf. or a carrier.but yes, moving rigged ships is a pain unless you have a big alliance or corp to fall behind. i would like something for the littler guys. in fact i was actually thinking of posting the idea of a smaller freighter. simply due to the fact that you have two options to haul stuff. the ~20k m3 offered by t1 industrials for non specific cargo. or 450k-900k offered by freighters."
2/2/2014,great idea. something that has been needed for a very long time.
2/2/2014,"i like the idea but i would love to see them be able to use the micro jump drive, with 50% reduction in reactivation delayother then that +1 from me"
2/2/2014,"why a microjump drive? travelling 100km is not important for a hauler. using actual jump drives to get across many systems however, is important. if it's to stop people from scramming you and killing you 100k won't save you from an inty."
2/2/2014,"even though most of my sp and time is invested in cloaked ships, i wholeheartedly support the idea of an in game mechanic that allows people to actually hunt cloaks down."
2/2/2014,most likely reason was it caused some drainage on the server that could have been freed up for other resources like...pvping or such.
2/2/2014,"since the jukebox was entirely client side, unlike the new system which takes cues from the server, it actually increased the amount of server resources used, not decreased.also, their official excuse was that 'we don;'t want to do this!' not because it was even hard, but because it was hard to get to integrated with twitch, which some people use, but most people don't."
2/2/2014,"i think you've gone a long way to reducing the gap in the recent years with 3% implants only. i think the current cost to entry is fairly decent. a lot of the winning setups last year cost under 2 billion isk which i think is an acceptable price tag for a new team competing in the tournament. (and you can easily do 6 bc/6 cruiser rush or whatever if you are struggling to find the cash to compete.) i think maybe refunding the plex entry cost to teams who make it past the group stages could make things more attractive for smaller teams. i would like to see more trading cards in the game like the neo cards you handed out. perhaps even have player cards for competing teams (like baseball cards) for players who have taken part in x amount of matches and have their ship history listed in the tournament. having yourself added as a permanent part of the game's history on an in-game collectible really excites me as a player. you could also then have in-game booster packs that contain so many of these cards given out to people who compete in the tournament, at holiday events, and for sales promotions like a free booster pack for every plex you buy etc. they would be relatively low effort to implement would just require someone to do research and type it up onto an in-game item description. i also think that the prize distribution in the tournament should be changed, currently there is a massive payout for 1st place and 2nd place, 3rd place gets 100x less and 4th place is worthless. i think this creates a less meaningful final series, as essentially, whether win or lose in the final you are guaranteed almost the same prize as the 1st place winner, and there is everything to play for in the 2nd vs 3rd place match, but 3rd vs 4th place is a complete booby prize fighting for a small amount of isk and a bronze medal. if you redistributed the 50 unique frigate hulls and the 50 unique cruiser hulls to the following i think it would create more interest in the semi final set of matches and also encourage more teams to be competitive because you don't have to make it to the finals to get a prize. 1st: 30 unique cruiser hulls & 30 unique frigate hulls2nd: 15 unique cruiser hulls & 15 unique frigate hulls3rd: 5 unique cruiser hulls & 5 unique frigate hulls4th: some plex prizeperhaps have smaller plex prizes like refunded entrance fee for teams who make it past the group stages. again, by spreading the wealth of victory slightly more outside of the finals and into more places i think more teams will think they have a shot of winning, and getting yourself on a in-game item and being part of history even if you end up going 0-2 in the tournament is attractive to some players.prehaps you could have a 'little cup' or 'newbies cup' or something that only allows x year old accounts to compete and players who have never competed in a tournament before obviously this may involve having to look at ips & hardware ids to try and prevent smurfs. and a lesser prize such as pirate faction rookie ships etc. at the end. you could also just have a tournament that only allows ships which are in easy reach of newer players like ""t1 cruisers, t2/t1 destroyers and t2/t1 frigates only"". contributer to eve is easy:"
2/2/2014,"so that just sounds to me its been ignored tbh, if its been mentioned so many times, and its still not implemented."
2/2/2014,"hahayou've lost your mind!!!no, hell no!!!if this happens you will see a huge decrease in active accounts."
2/2/2014,"that not needed. now since jetcan mining is dead, what we need is a new way to steal ore from miners, it could be a new module that ""shipons"" ore from mining barges/exhumers (you get suspect flag)."

2/3/2014,really? because according to your kb you're an industrial renter that doesn't have a kill to his name.
2/3/2014,"i support this idea. so much :d.null dangerousity would still feel different from w-space but at the same time the local would slightly loose its importance.also, thats a buff to bomber hotdrooooooppppssss"
2/3/2014,"right but the bear tears are coming in from ""afk cloaking."" if it's all hot drops it's content and pvp, no afking. i prefer that myself."
2/3/2014,"personally, i'd be in favour of an actual pvp arena setup something like arena stations that people can dock at, inside of which is a big hollow space that fights can happen in. undocking into that space would be done through a specialized interface system, which could be used both for tournaments and for other types of consensual pvp. the arena interface would let you set up fights according to some reasonable number of parameters (open fights vs by-invitation ones, limitations by ship class/tech as desired, and so on). the system should also support options for prizes and spectator mode.that gives individual players the tools to set up their own tournaments, up to and including everything ccp would do for the big-deal tournaments (except for 'spawn prizes', which shouldn't happen anyway), while incidentally setting up a proper system for 'honourable' 1v1 pvp for the guys who whine about that. at the same time, it would still be within the sandbox people would still need to fly real ships to the arena, and would actually lose them within. at the very least, it'd also be preferable to some tournaments getting the blessing of ccp teleporting stuff out to a magical pvp instance, and some tournaments having to play on singularity or similar."
2/3/2014,"your idea includes the criterion that everyone has access to the same tools, both in terms of prizes and location. that makes sense to me.i'm still concerned about the integrity of the sandbox. i see a minor issue with introducing a feature or tool which is result-oriented rather than process-oriented.to illustrate the difference between a tool that enables a process versus a tool that enables a result:old probes were a process-oriented tool. drop a probe in a specific location. hit ""scan"". the probe gives you coordinates of the signals it finds, no matter how accurate or inaccurate.if you want to pinpoint the signal, you normally warp to the scanned location, drop a more accurate (but lower range) probe, and scan again. this gives you a more accurate signal that you can warp to.you can repeat this until you get a signal that is accurate enough to place you within sub-warp distance of the target (generally on the same grid, or in some circumstances a neighboring grid, for example if you're probing for a nano ship that is moving fast, which means it won't be where you scanned it when you get there).these probes were just a feature of the game that did specific things within the game engine. they would return warpable spots on your map which corresponded to (coordinates of some scannable object) + (some random offset to emulate inaccuracy). there was no purpose, or suggested use built into the mechanism of the probes. there was only the mechanism of how the probes worked, the process for how to use the tool.this meant that, yes, if you wanted to, you could use the probes to do the thing they were intended to do (find objects). but you could also use the mechanisms to create different results. for example, you could intentionally use a large probe to produce an inaccurate signal, which would give you a warpable location on your map that did not correspond to any celestial or line between two celestials. an instant safespot. thus, ships that would fit probe launchers had some potential additional tactical abilities which happened to suit them very well. you could use probes to find hidden pilots, and also use them to hide yourself. now that's what i call brilliant game design.on the other hand, new probes are the opposite. drop 8 probes in a pre-suggested formation (which happens to be the optimal formation for blanketing a system), hit scan, and the probes generate non-warpable locations which represent the location of the scanned objects plus some inaccuracy.next, arrange the probes into a pinpointing formation (there is a button which arranges the probes for you, and it happens to arrange them into the optimal formation), and keep scanning, moving, and scaling down the probes until you have a 100% signal. only then do you get a warpable location, which corresponds to exactly where the object was scanned, with no deviation.these probes are not just a tool that you can use however you like. there is no ""flip-side"" or alternate process you can use to produce different results. they are just the prescribed way to find hidden objects, and they don't do anything else. that, in my opinion, goes against the grain of the concept of the sandbox. a result-oriented game mechanic as rigid as a mini-game. to put it mildly, i'd call this trashy game design that has no place in this sandbox game.to put this in the context of your arena idea; i think that the over-arching concept of having a separate place, unconnected to the universe outside, where sterile, pre-arranged fights can take place it kind of defeats the whole point of eve. one of the fundamental principles of eve is that in order to play the game, you must hit the ""undock"" button to throw yourself out into the wonderful, dangerous, unpredictable galaxy, and subject yourself to the lingering possibility of disaster. you could get suicide ganked. you could have your mining picnic ruined by bumpers. you could have your mission item stolen by a ninja.you have to incorporate the presence of everyone else into your gameplay considerations.running a successful event in the events business demands that you take these things into account. if you're going to have many participants or spectators in one place, you need to figure out how to minimize the risk. you need to get people to spread out to discourage smartbombing. you need to have a contingency in place to deal with potential suicide gankers taking out your contestants. you have to think about where to host your event, who is going to show up, whether you need to accommodate negative sec status pirates, or negative faction standing militia members. you need to know what to tell someone when they inform you that they are at war with another participant.i think if you had such an arena as you describe, it might sterilize a lot of what makes eve into eve. and if eve is not eve, then it is just another hotkey mmo, albeit with wonky inputs and complicated damage formulae."
2/3/2014,"i get your point, really but the fact of the matter is that these ""sterile, pre-arranged fights"" already take place on a semi-regular basis. that's what the whole point of tournaments is. maybe you don't like that idea, that's fine. i, personally, don't fly at that level either. my point is that tournaments already exist, they already take people out into a safe random instance to fight. that's a problem for all the reasons you're suggesting, but it's worse since it exists right now in a 'ccp meddling in the sandbox' sense.if things were changed so that there were a small number of pvp arenas in hisec (no more than 5, i think; one per race, plus a concord-run one), then the alliance tournament (and, for that matter, any other big important tournament) would be held at a specific place in eve. people interested in meddling with it could wardec the participants and camp the station, trying to stop people from getting their ships into position. they could attempt to suicide gank unique and expensive stuff en-route. that's something that can't happen when the tournaments are exclusively in ccp hands, arranged by magical teleportation, the result of putting these tools into player control. sure, the actual fights themselves are isolated from the rest of the sandbox while they're going on that's kind of the point. that kind of even environment doesn't destroy the concept of events, it gives more tools with which to enact them, more ways for people who want that kind of gameplay to get involved with it, and more ways for tournament gameplay to exist within the context of the larger sandbox."

2/4/2014,"auto-logoff? stay away with that please. i am so frelling glad, that eve doesn't do this s***t. imagine you are sitting in your pos, floating somewhere in hisec space or cloaked in some safespot. you go chat on jabber with your coalition, or are heavily discussing something on mumble, or efting, or checking some forums, ... then you tab back and you notice you have to restart the client and login. you will have no idea if and what was written in all the open chat channels (unless you start scrambling through the logs). you will also have to wait for ewarp to finish doing its thing.""just dock up when you go afk / tab out"" is not an alternative, sorry. and not everyone sitting still and watching/waiting is an afk cloaker in nullsec. please don't force me to do silly moves all time in order to stay logged.they introduced auto-logoff in a game i used to play since 2003, it's there for some years now and it still drives me mad even tho, or maybe especially because i don't actively play it much but just log in to hang around a bit."
2/4/2014,"the people most inclined to whine and cry about cloaky ships are the people who want a theme park version of eve online. if ever the community has given you the impression that those sort of people are wanted/needed in eve, you have been very mistaken."
2/4/2014,"yes, we agree on this.ccp is abusing their powers to monopolise the tournament market.no, i don't think the solution to one problem (abuse of power) is creating a different problem - you be unable to wedding-crash a tournament because the contestants just keep their tournament-fit ships in the station and (if they want to be safe) simply clone-jump there when it's time to participate.in my opinion these are both equally important aspects of eve; you have to take risk, and you have access to the same tools as everyone else. moving the offending aspect of the game (alliance tournament) from one to the other isn't as good a solution as simply removing the problem by having the event abide by the game mechanics that already exist.another reason why your solution, the pvp arena, is not adequate, is that it only caters to one type of event; arranged pvp tournaments. every other type of event that competes for viewers and participants with the offending events is going to be at a new disadvantage. warp racing, for example - which takes place in space, and over a large number of solar systems, since the goal is to warp and jump from system to system, plan your route carefully to avoid potential hazards, and get to a destination as quickly as possible - would not benefit from the secure environment of the arena, because it would still have to happen in space, and still be subject to all the risks and dangers of undocking.same with pretty much any other type of in-space event. if you held a probing competition, you couldn't really do it in the arena. if you did one of those ""i'm hiding somewhere in low sec, first person to find me and pod me gets a prize"" type things, that would also not be suited for your arena.the inherent danger of undocking is such a fundamental part of eve that you can't just push it to the side. you would be turning eve into a different game."
2/4/2014,"i don't really see your point. i'm getting ""here's a list of arbitrary non-tournament events that would not be improved by an improvement to the tournament system, therefore the tournament system should not be improved.""this strikes me as a bad point, so you may want to elaborate. there is a demand for tournaments. tournament gameplay requires a measure of protection, since otherwise you don't get 'fair fights', you get 'gatecamps' and 'hotdrops' and such which are interesting, but are qualitatively different from the kind of content people are looking for in a tournament setting. that measure of protection is currently only provided by ccp for certain official tournaments, and is counterfeited by certain other events (by the method of taking them out of the sandbox entirely and running them somewhere else).my proposal is to take some of ccp's tools and put them in player hands, as a strict improvement on tournaments being exclusively ccp-run. i don't have a position on 'all the other possible events players might possibly want to run', aside from 'not everything needs its own dedicated subsystem'. that said, this particular kind of content kind of does need a particular subsystem to exist at all, and so i support putting that gameplay in the hands of more people. the kind of people who will proceed to play arena games exclusively, and never venture out beyond the boundaries of hisec weren't ever going to join your other events anyway.as a side note, the idea that a pvp arena into which two people (or fleets) undock and one is guaranteed to be destroyed being less dangerous than other kinds of events is somewhat bizarre. this isn't the 'vr combat simulator' proposal. if you want to get into a fight in the arena, then you're either winning or losing your ship (barring a few rare cases which legitimately end in draws)."
2/4/2014,"soas i continue to read this thread over. ccp wants more tournament style gameplay. readily available for anyone?well, this is an option i've thought ofwhy not do arena based pvp.let me explain this concept!make a really big station /somewhere/ where exactly, i don't know. and when i mean big, i mean several hundred kilometres. its a station, but inside the station is an arena, a really big one!make the arena the only ""instanced"" place in eve.people formup, make teams in a fleet. they randomly get pared up against another fleet. either frigs/cruisers/bcs only or mixed fleets. killmails work the same, but location is shown up as in the arena. killboards will more the likely poke their sites to show statistics.every weekend/other weekend. have mini tournaments setup through twitchtv. also, have players host events/fights on ccps twitchtv channel. (obviously trusted players) more gameplay, tournament style fighting readily available for everyone!"
2/4/2014,"i think the mechanic here that's broken is the fact that a fleet can have 100 people in it sitting on/in a station and be endlessly bubbled by a single no-risk interdictor that has macro'd the act of undocking, dropping a bubble, and redocking all without having to worry about dying, despite being endlessly outnumbered and right under the nose of a fleet that could kill a dictor with even just a sneeze.obvious techniques to kill said interdictor involve using remote sebos to try and boost the scan res of a fast locking ship capable of alpha-striking the dictor... or smartbombs. both techniques are defeated by the fact that the invul timer for the dictor just flat out doesn't allow anything to ever happen to it. on many stations, the undock range won't come anywhere near where smartbombs can reach because of the restrictions on using smartbombs near stations.the only mechanic right now to deal with the bubbles is to have a stealth bomber counter the bubbles using a bomb. this only helps get the bubbles down though, as the invul timer on the dictor still keeps it 100% perfectly safe.is this considered abuse of a mechanic? or this intentionally allowed gameplay?"
2/4/2014,"minigame isn't the answer. definetly not. miners, especially those in low/null/wh don't need another thing to keep their eyes off of important aspects of the game - dscan/local/intel channels. besides, having to transfer ore from ore holds to cans/ore holds if you want to mine effectively using hulks.fyi, not everyone is a retriever/mackinaw miner who can afk for 30 minutes on end."
2/4/2014,"it won't even be more isk.... just more minerals.. if you flood the market with minerals, the price of minerals drops. the best way to increase mining profits is to have massive ship destruction (like b-r5), thereby increasing the demand for minerals."

2/4/2014,"tl:dr - change tsm to make it so max shield recharge is at 0% as well as shield breaking point.the tactical shield manipulation skill reads as follows ""skill at preventing damage from penetrating the shield, including the use of shield hardeners and other advanced shield modules. reduces the chance of damage penetrating the shield when it falls below 25% by 5% per skill level, with 0% chance at level 5.""this, in theory, is a good idea. it allows shield tankers to absorb the maximum amount of damage upon their shields before their softer armor comes into play. however, the skill itself gimps passive shield tank and since it is required to train for multiple necessary modules you can't avoid it.the problem arises from the fact that passive shield recharge is highest at 25% shields. a shield tank will actually tank more damage by having this skill at 0 because the shield will be at it's max recharge point for much longer. since the skill is required however, most pilots can't take advantage of their max shield recharge for very long.my recommendation is that the function of the skill changes slightly. in addition to reducing the chance of damage going to armor, the skill reduces the max shield recharge point from 25% down to 0% in the same way that the skill works now. in this way even in the face of overwhelming damage the shield can provide a little additional damage absorption.the description would probably read something like.""skill at preventing damage from penetrating the shield, including the use of shield hardeners and other advanced shield modules. reduces the chance of damage penetrating the shield when it falls below 25% by 5% per skill level, with 0% chance at level 5. additionally the point of optimum shield regeneration is lowered at the same rate giving the capsuleer the highest shield regeneration when their shields are close to failing.""thoughts? right now tsm is useless except as a prereq for invuls etc. this skill would make it valuable to have at level v.an additional way of making it a little more powerful would be to stretch max regen all the way from 25% on down, but that might be a little op."

2/5/2014,"someone didn't think that thought through, considering the crow especially, which runs at damned near 5km/s. would take about 20 seconds to get there, which means.... you'd be screwed, especially since the most favored crow fits favor a long point, which runs about a 24km range. so with that in mind, in about 15 seconds, you'd be pointed and would stand no chance of escaping, even with maxed navigation skills.jump capable, maybe, in a t2 variant later down the road. but first, it would be nice to get a standard variant so that people could just haul their fitted/rigged ships with some form of defensive capability (tank and/or ewar).i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
2/5/2014,"you seem hung up on the word ""tournament"". would you feel better if i called it ""racing tournament"" or ""probing tournament""?yes, this type of gameplay you are describing is qualitatively different from the type of gameplay that happens within the rules (game mechanics) of eve. ergo, it's not eve.i don't know what high sec has to do with this, most events are held in high sec. but if you have evidence that there is negligible overlap between spectators and participants in ""tournaments"" versus spectators and participants in ""other events"", then please present it, as it would contradict my personal experience in running events.the same people who watch my events, and compete in my events, also watch and compete in so-called ""tournaments"". that means ""tournaments"" are in direct competition with ""events"", and as such it is unfair that one should have access to tools which protect the participants from outside influence, while the other one does not. as an event organiser, i lose isk when a so-called ""tournament"" happens, because the people who show up to my events are also the people who show up to ""tournaments"".yes, perhaps your arena idea would cause ccp to stop teleporting people, but in the same way that building a baseball stadium might stop the neighborhood kids from hitting baseballs through your window. it's an overcomplicated solution to a problem that is behavior. the simple solution is that they just stop doing it, and then there's no need to spend lots of resources on building a stadium.an environment in which you are guaranteed that a) there are no surprises (hidden link ships, hot drops, login-traps, etc.) and b) no strategical advantages (such as fortifying a position where the enemy has to come to you through a gate, through a jump animation, through an undock procedure, etc.) doesn't sound very dangerous to me.more importantly, it doesn't sound like eve."
2/5/2014,"ah, i see. your position is that you disapprove of tournaments entirely, and want them to not happen. given that this is a thread about suggesting possible improvements to the tournament system, ""stop having tournaments"" is not really a constructive or helpful suggestion.that's not to say that your point is completely unreasonable but given that ccp had a csm session specifically about tournaments, and this thread was specifically framed around brainstorming things like ""ways to increase interest in tournaments"", ""ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournaments"", and ""ways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments"", it's pretty much a given that tournaments are here to stay, and that ccp is open to the idea of giving players tournament-hosting tools. indeed, it's quite likely that they've already started coding improvements to the tournament system, and are looking for feedback on how open those tools should be made.that's why i suggested what i did; given that tournaments are going to continue happening, the tournament tools used to support that should be open to all players, to the point where people can engage in casual 1v1 'dueling'-style arena pvp using the same system. after all, it's the same dev time that'll be going into the system anyways, and there's certainly people who'd appreciate the use of those systems outside major sponsored tournament-type events, so why not give them the use of that?""because i don't like fair fights, i don't want people who like fair fights to be able to enjoy fair fights"" is definitely an answer to my question, but it's not enough of a reason to cause ccp to shrug and stop doing tournaments. in all seriousness, i get your point but you haven't answered my question. what can happen, in an arena into which undocking is guaranteed to result in either a kill or a shiploss, which is less dangerous than undocking anywhere else? if you undock into normal space, your ship may be destroyed at any time. if you undock into an arena, your ship may be destroyed if you fail to destroy your opponent's ship. what makes the arena less of a risk? what is the arena player not risking that any other player is?""because i don't want to involve myself in using a proposed new system, i stand to lose competitive advantage against other people who would do so"" is also an answer to my question, and it's an even worse answer. ccp will implement new systems which they feel will generate interest and subscriptions for the game. making pvp more accessible to new players is something which is likely to contribute to that.i shrug. every time anyone suggests anything that will make eve more accessible, there's always people who argue against it, purely because they don't want eve to be more accessible. to be sure, a good part of eve's appeal is its unforgiving nature but at the same time, eve won't grow if it doesn't let new players in. there needs to be a balance, and i really, really don't think the existence of optional pvp arenas in hisec is something that will totally ruin the game forever. that said, there will always be people who feel that any arbitrary change 'x' is something that will totally ruin the game forever, so if you remain unconvinced, that's your prerogative. it seems rather likely that some kind of tournament system will be showing up before too long, so now's your chance to lay out your own view of how you'd like the tournament system to be implemented. continuing to object to the existing system will not cause it to be removed from the game, so if you really think that this is a problem, you need to reconsider your approach."
2/5/2014,i nominate it to become 72 hours rather than 24hrs.its that easy folks.

2/5/2014,"my first idea is that skill is correct if used within the median item price a bit more o less (a 10%), it need only to be pulled out from the scammers that use it. but now in fact must believe tha it must be removed because every buy order must be fully isk covered, isn't more a only scam problem, it affect also the healty trader."

2/6/2014,"i said ""stop teleporting people"". that doesn't stop you from having tournaments. i don't disapprove of tournaments. just follow the rules that all the other players have to follow, and i'm happy.i disagree that being employed at ccp means you can play the game differently than all the other players, when your gameplay is taking place in, and affecting, the game environment. regardless of who pays your salary, you can log on to the game as a regular player, on a regular player character, and if you want to host a tournament as that player, with that player character, then you have the privilege of doing so, same as everyone else.if that's their decision, then so be it. all i can do when faced with the concept of a new feature is to look at the information provided, look at the information i already have, and form an opinion. my opinion is that could make eve less eve, and i'm here to play eve, so that is a step in the wrong direction.i like fair fights. i want others to enjoy fair fights. when i want a fair fight, i play a game that has fair fights. so does everyone else. eve is not that game. eve does not mechanically support fair fights.i don<U+FFFD>t know, you tell me.if there<U+FFFD>s no difference in risk between undocking to fight, and using your arena idea to fight, then what<U+FFFD>s the point of the arena? we can already undock.the rest of your idea is great; an interface with brackets and sign-ups and space for indicating prizes and tournament locations and what equipment to bring, restricting who can sign up or making the tournament public, and so on. all that is great. i would love to have that. that would make hosting my tournaments so much easier."

2/6/2014,"drones have some advantages and disadvantage guns, and they are purposely different animals. it makes good game play. what makes poor game play often happen when mechanics that scale poorly (or too well). rr scales too well, allowing any fleet member to tank the dps of an entire fleet. in most cases, there is a limit where the incoming alpha is greater than the buffer of a ship, but not necessarily true for capitals and supercapitals. drone assist scales too well, allowing one fleet member to control the dps of 1000 drones. i personally would have preferred a different solution than limiting drone assist to 50 drones. i would have advocated drones jammed by ecm bursts and lockbreaker bombs nullify the drone assist command so drones return to their owners control, but the 50 drone limit is a more pragmatic and workable solution."

2/7/2014,"i would like to think that this is still available. this could be an awesome concept and would really work with modern mobile items. have all players start at a beacon say 50 km from the cornucopia. at the cornucopia, there would be various cargo containers full of misc items as well as mobile depots. along the radius of the cornucopia, say 15 km away, there would be several smaller containers with less items in them. players would have to scoop and refit there, or scoop and make a run for it. there would be other beacons or celestial that they could warp to, perhaps another outpost with loot. or maybe they could warp to an asteroid belt and kill the npcs there, which could drop t2 loot, for the user to put on his/her ship if desired.i am not sure how sponsors would work but i am sure something could be figured out. maybe a ccp member gives said player a gift from his/her sponsor. maybe they could ""redeem item to cargohold"".some restrictions would be, no cloaking devices allowed, period. you would have to also have a system wide effect that prevents users from creating bookmarks. this would prevent people from hiding, or if you do allow bookmarks, maybe after 5-10 mins of staying out of the fight, npcs police or rogue drones would come and attack to encourage you to warp away.anyways, i think it would be a neat idea. it could be done as a free for all or in teams of two.-lt"

2/7/2014,"nothing needs to be done about . it is pure social engineering. you're made to believe that a too-good-to-be-true deal is at your fingertips, and then the rug is pulled out from under you at the last minute. the best way, as usual, to protect oneself against scams of this sort is to actually be familiar with the market. if something looks off, then it usually is.those who complain about the scam really need to ask themselves this question: how does having the rug pulled out from under you via the scam differ from somebody simply happening to fill the buy order before you? i can't think of any functional difference between those two scenarios. you are not entitled to fill a buy order just because you bought some items and have them at the ready for doing so.the scam is a non-issue that people only think is an issue because a certain skill happens to be used to facilitate it. i can understand why it's easy to think that you're being scammed by some broken aspect of the skill, but that's absolutely not what's happening. the skill is working as intended, and you're being psychologically manipulated. it's not some sort of ""i win"" button that another player can press and instantly relieve you of your isk. you have to be ignorant about market conditions. you actively choose, at every step of the way, to participate."

2/10/2014,"run tournaments on a dedicated server where all players have all skills maxed, and all items are effectively free.or if running the at on tq, then add stations in the tournament systems with all allowed items on sale at a reasonable cost, and don't allow players to take anything back with them. you could take this further and have items on sale at a tournament price, and somehow limit spending - eg there's a price budget as well as a points budget. take a look at any sports coverage, and how they do the analysis in breaks in the match. do this for eve. there should be replays of key points in the fight, and explanations of what happened and why that made a difference. just have different tiers in the competition with different levels of prize - only allow alliances to enter a team at a single tier. the tiers could have different ship/points limitations etc. access to camera ships, and overall team status for streaming purposes - that would probably imply that it would need to be a dedicated server."

2/11/2014,"moving to nullsec doesn't really solve anything, since you're going to be renting space. from concord.why do we ""claim"" a system, then pay concord a fee to keep the system ours is what's beyond me. i realize ccp developped it so you would still have a money sink even after you settled the far reaches of space.what i'd like is total independence from empire. i.e. when i claim space, it's mine, and if anyone is collecting a fee on stuff happening in the system, it's me. not concord, not ded, not sisters of eve. me."
2/11/2014,"your another one that wants to nerf high sec so to speak. we rent from concord as an isk sink which was over come by the massive alliances and coalitions. if you destroy the stations which was done once in histry before ccp stopped it caused a mass loss of player own assets in the station. i also have no doubt that even if this did happen where empire becomes like null with the major powers of null sec moving in it would be like pocos, day 0 goonswarm swarmed empire placing as many pocos as they could at massive high taxes, the stations would end up owned by the major player alliances and either ban those who arent a part of them or blue from accessing the station or you would be charges massive fees for docking and refining rates.if we did blow up stations like the trade hubs, imagine the isk loss and the progress that markets would have to ultimately reset, over 90% of the market is built by players. im for people popping macro miners but not every miner is a macro and some of us enjoy industry and undercutting the competition in market pvp.even the csm have been against those who want to do away with empire even though its become a massive war ground, while initially it will be a major isk sink but just like nullsec, the player base will catch up with the isk sink and be even more powerful forcing people to takes sides as it is now to get into nullsec"
2/11/2014,"you do realize that jita 4-4 would be nuked within minutesit would crash the game market, and the tears would flow like a river.after a dam burst its banks and taking out whatever lies in it way!also, goonswarm online: your **** is ours! blue donut edition<U+FFFD> is already upon us."

2/11/2014,"the mining has always been about two things, that were supposed to be balanced out.risk vs. reward.and since odyssey, when hidden belts became non-hidden and could be accessed by anyone without the use of scan probes, made the level of the ""risk"" go up. rewards have stayed the same.same with all the interceptor/ship warp changes (a dominix battleship goes alignes and warps faster than a hulk with 2x polycarbon engine housing rigs, logic is where exactly?), risk keeps getting higher while rewards don't change or even lessen.i don't even need to go into all the changes that happened to mining barges/exhumers that have raised the risk of mining.that's the main problem that ccp needs to address. if you've increased the risk factor how come the rewards aren't really up to par?"
2/11/2014,"a couple of suggestions:1. make static asteroid belts spawn as ice fields currently do, and re-add scannable belts with better ore types/tiers. 2. add more tiers for each type of ore with higher mineral densities.3. reduce the mean ore amount in each asteroid and multiply the number of asteroids in a field. the above will make mining more dynamic, and with proper balancing will both thwart afk/bot play and reward atk play with higher yields."

2/13/2014,"i'm not sure if you're suggesting slowing down just combat scenario's like forced tidi or all gameplay. but if it was just just combat situations you'd be screwing solo/small gangs that want to hit and run stuff by giving people outside tidi more time to react and save their getting ganked buddy. or if you're suggesting all gameplay then again it's a bad idea, you already can give up huge periods of time for relatively small tasks as it is."

2/13/2014,"hello.i'd like to present to the csm my idea that our official forums are far too heavily moderated by the isds.they will lock threads for ""trolling"" just because they do not share your opinion, or because you are voicing a negative feeling about an eve mechanic.eg: a topic like ""cynosural fields are op"" is likely to be locked for ""trolling"" simply because it expressed the idea that eve is not a perfect game and there are still things in it that should be reworked and rebalanced.why does this matter? well for interesting discussions to occur we should allow people at least some freedom in what they say.the posts on the forums will become incredibly boring and stagnant if everyone has to tiptoe around trigger happy isds locking threads.and also, though it's been beaten to death, ""bring back caod"". ie: let anyone post in caod. the rules they implemented could have been a great idea, they could have helped caod and made it more civil. instead, they killed it.ccp created groups like the csm to give feedback about various things in the eve universe.i'd really appreciate it if you considered my proposal to go to the ccp community managers and ask them to try to be a bit lighter with forum moderation.hi."
2/13/2014,"i would like some clarification on something that seems stupid to me. firstly let me clarify, my point is from the perspective of low sec, so if you don't care about low sec, i suggest you stop reading now.i assume we can all agree, they're a large boost to anybody recieving them. so, even though ccp have marginally made them less safe by forcing them to be outside pos shields, they're still at very little risk, despite being a major force multiplier, sitting them on a station or on a gate ready to jump out and cloak is simple. so, why is it that when somebody does something like remote sebo an outlaw, or any othere remote boost that they get suspect/criminally flagged depending on what the person recieving has shot, yet somebody recieving gang links boosts and does the same crime as the previous example and the link char isn't flagged? this would make a major difference to how passively they can be used considering the percentage of frigs/destroyers in the faction warfare areas, that could otherwise force them to jump out or dock. considering they're commonly used in such ship type scale fights, it seems only right that they should be able to drive that advantage off, which currently they can't due to gate/station gun fire."
2/13/2014,"more often than not, boosters tend to be alts tabbed down while flying your main, because ganglinks gimp your fit pretty badly. so, you can try to bump or alpha it, trust me, it works."
2/13/2014,"it works aslong as the target isn't paying attention, its a pretty big assumption to say more often than not people are tabbed out, as loads of people have multiple monitors. you're not really suggesting it's working as intended due to link characters occasionally not paying attention?this wasn't really the point either. the main point was why other remote assistance flags a character as a criminal/outlaw while gang links which arguably are the biggest boost you can recieve, do not.think about it from the perspective of someone in the fw areas. most of the pvp in them is frigate/destroyer pvp. imagine you're having a ""1""v1 with somebody in a t1 frig, they are using links to significantly boost the ability of their ship, their links are situated on a gate ready to jump out and cloak at the first sign of danger. imagine somehow you've managed to get out of their extended tackle range and warped to the boosting ship. this ship was being used against you for a criminal act/supporting a war target against you. yet you can't engage it thanks to the protection of gate guns? that's stupid.that differs from somebody using say a remote sebo alt to boost their main gatecamping, which rightly becomes flagged and therefore a valid target."
2/13/2014,"this will be messy: so if you boost your fleet mate you go suspect? imagine the impact his will have in highsec! (lol, poor incursion runners). to be frank, gang links are not a targeted module, which makes giving them a suspect / criminal flag upon activation problematic. i think the real solution is simply to force links to be on-grid. they are extremely imbalancing, so forcing them on grid, while very difficult on some fleet types, is the optimal solution!"
2/13/2014,"no because they're not aggressing other players. like i said i don't see how other remote assistance modules can have different suspect/outlaw mechanics. for your example, somebody would have to go suspect/outlaw in order for the links to be flagged. it's not even like they couldn't be docked up, but it would mean in low sec that small ships could drive them into the station or into another system. which considering the links are working against the frigs/destroyers i don't think is unreasonable."
2/13/2014,"while the above poster brings up some good reasons why this may not work... i find the ops idea pretty interesting.not only would it be useful, as he said, if you are flying more than one account.... but also for fleet 'roams' or 'patrols'. fleet leader can create a proposed route and hand it out to the fleet. this way fleet members are more informed, and scouts can then fly a few systems ahead while easily keeping track of where they are in relation to the fleet.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
2/13/2014,"quite nice of you to post the link to the original thread so i don't have to.but all kidding aside, if your proposal in features & ideas discussion really gets momentum, you can be quite sure it will get the official attention it deserves from the csm, ccp, or both. i hope it does actually, i quite like your proposal.none the less, this thread gets a lock for being redundant.the rules:16. redundant and re-posted threads will be locked. as a courtesy to other forum users, please search to see if there is a thread already open on the topic you wish to discuss. if so, please place your comments there instead. multiple threads on the same subject clutter up the forums needlessly, causing good feedback and ideas to be lost. please keep discussions regarding a topic to a single thread. isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"

2/14/2014,"meant to reply to this earlier, got eaten by work.i think a bracketing system for tournaments, either (or both) neo and at, would work well. provide prizes for the victors of the lower brackets, prizes which will help them compete in the brackets above them. that gives non-top-tier teams some money, it gives players a sense of accomplishment and a taste of what's to come (sound's at run was somewhat good for this; our first match in particular was winnable had we more experience).i would tier tournaments by tournament performance or ship budget rather than player age. one could run a team that repeatedly performs poorly (gsf's team!) despite significant potential, or a team full of relative noobs who are nonetheless the hottest up and coming tournament pilots. you could run a series of tournaments made of constructed teams (a la neo), then use the results from that to compute the seed for the at-- alliances with experienced, skilled tournament pilots should be put up against similar alliances. alliances for which there is insufficient data should play in qualifiers, perhaps on sisi (or perhaps not; i can see metagaming around this happening). re tools, one thing a former corpmate mentioned talking to you about was a tournament bubble deployable-- something that performs no other function than to define a radius so people can see it. that'd be a neat start, although graphics would be hard (yellow ""warp disruptor""?)"
2/14/2014,"make it similar to america's cup, winner gets to chose the rules for next year."
2/14/2014,op your an idiot lets be honest oh lets add a delay on locking on decloak what do you get anything small t1 or t2 frig sees you knows theres a delay eitehr 1 combat fit for pvp rushs you and in effect kill you assuming your in point range(bombing should only be done when you have a warp through so the range is meh) and 2 if your out of range my nemesis has 119k range on the torps and 130k lock with my fits just warp away simplly put a bomber with a lock delay on decloak is next to worthless against anything combaty with someone paying attention and would only be useful on hualers and barges and even the barges its iffy since as pointed out before they have a flight of lights. again as has been said before a solo bomber is beyond meh same with a solo bomber bombing stuff your meh i dont think a single bomb can kill anything in one hit beyond a mwding t1 frig. you mentioned in fleets well guess what i could take 10 incursus warp in on something using a cloaking as a warpto and chanegs are anything short of a cap kill it(yes i know uber fit bs could likely tank and all but 10 incursus can still do a lot of dmg and cost nothing) in short bombers are fine the way they are.
2/14/2014,"when will ppl stop calling for nerf because of goon's fotm? really, this is getting old and painfull.this is how many ship were nerfed to the ground.what will it be next?if your bc cannot defend himself vs a solo sb and die, that's not because sb is op, it's because you are bad at flying said bc.and for frigs, lol, the sb is probably the worst choice to engage frigs unless bombing them....."
2/14/2014,"bomber attacked my helios the other day.... foolish maniticorein general, i'm pretty happy with bombers. they are unique, with an interesting weapon system that truly is only really viable against stationary targets or large targets. their bombs are great anti-blob tools, but require work and coordination to accurate deploy. they might be great for grinding sov structures, but even a small force can harass the hell out of a siege fleet. if they create the equivalent of tracking computers for missiles (i.e. a module to lower explosion sig & velocity), they might need re-examining. but i don't see where they are overpowered in the current environment."
2/14/2014,"in highsec, you gain a suspect flag if you remote assist someone that is attack an opponent that cannot attack you legally. so, you are right that the incursion link alt won't go suspect... unless someone attacks the incursioners and the incursioners shoot back."
2/14/2014,"well that's exactly what i'm suggesting, if they are being used to boost a player's combat capability against another player, they should be fair game. i'm not sure how i feel about them being fair game for everybody in highsec, but, if that's how it works for things like logi/remote sebo etc then it should be consistent."

2/15/2014,"afk gameplay... so that would means that ""anchoring"" mechanic is bad and need change to."
2/15/2014,"afk cloaking threads are always entertaining!but seriously now, a question for the 'hunters'.say there was a game mechanic to force cloakies out of hiding. just as an example, yet another deployable that causes all cloaks in system to slowly degrade over time. say after an hour or two, the cloak stops working. only way to avoid it is jump out of system. if you do, then jump back in, the 'degradation timer' resets completely. logging off doesnt stop the 'timer' (when you log back in the timer continues 'ticking' from whatever time was left when you logged out).so yeah, you can camp systems cloaked all you want, you just have to switch systems, or jump in an out, every hour or two.the question is: honestly guys, how would this be an uninteresting new mechanic?wouldn't it make things more lively?you could still camp a system for weeks, still play the 'psychological warfare game' (which i think is cool, btw), you just couldn't do it while you're off to work or pub crawling in rl.and the 'defenders' would get a small chance to catch you, once every hour or so, if they prepare and pay attention.wouldn't this - or a similar mechanic - be more fun, more interaction, more gameplay both for the 'hunters' and the 'prey'?btw, i'm no 'nullbear', i'm in lowsec fw/piracy, there's no such thing as a 'safe system' to me, reds & neutrals are everywhere, and i never engage in mining or pve.but from my outside perspective, it just seems to me that the 'hunters' resistance to any change on this matter is equal or stronger than the (i admit, often hilarious) nullbear tears."
2/15/2014,"i am going to have to answer no, for myself.this is focusing on a symptom, not the primary issue.please consider the following:cloaked campers are an issue, because the 'defenders' wish to maintain a persistent presence of ships which are at best poor at pvp. the primary tactic these ships use is evasion, for this reason.the campers are cloaked, because ships of superior fighting ability to them can be brought in, just not until they are aware of a need. this problem exists partly because these ships are not a normal presence.the real issue, is we are playing not simply a pvp game, but one featuring space combat.the ships exist in three tiers, in this regard to ability in space combat.on top, are dedicated pvp ships. they are not good at much more than pvp, so when other needs exist they have difficulty meeting them. obviously, they have superiority in space combat.in the middle, we have stealthy ships. they are mediocre at pvp, having compromised potential for the purpose of balancing their 'stealth' capacity. they are mediocre at space combat, being less effective than the pure dedicated ships.on the bottom, are the dedicated isk generation vessels, mining ships being an often cited example.these are the least effective at space combat, relying on avoiding conflict whenever possible.each level is capable of preying on those below it, and fighting against those on their own level.your suggestion ignores the disparity in fighting ability, and treats the symptom by simply limiting access to the middle group.if we want to see more fights, (aka interaction in the minds of many players), we need to dispel the perception of disparity between the levels that players can make plans around.give the lowest level the fighting ability to confront the mid level, and this resolves itself.noone expects the dedicated pvp ships to stand a post, and it would be absurd to coerce them for such.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
2/15/2014,"i'm a passionate reader of all 'carebear vs. tough guys' discussion.though mostly a strong supporter of the 'tough guy' side, i believe the 'carebear apologists' raise a few valid points. namely, (1) the need to give new players more ways to 'ease into' the game's difficulty and (2) the opportunity to extend the player base, if it can be done without compromising the ruthless and complex gameplay we all love.my proposal: introduce limited companies. natural new player progression would be:. npc corp. limited company (ltd.). corporation (inc.)all ingame player 'corps' would be either one or the other, with the abbreviation always shown after the corp name. thus we'd have corps like 'friendly newbie's corner, ltd.' and 'goonwaffe, inc.'.this is how it could work:ncp corps remain as they are, but with a very significant increase in taxes - like up to 40-50% or so. also, add additional high taxes to all buying and selling done by npc corp members.limited companies (ltds) have lower taxes than npc corps but still high - like 20-30% or so. also all buying and selling will be similarly taxed. i don't mean player taxes here, but game taxes - isk sinks. the company may also choose to tax its members to fund itself, but that would be on top of the default game tax.limited companies cannot own pos nor claim sovreignty. the may form alliances only with other ltds.players in ltds have their crimewatch safety permanently set to green. no 'yellow' or 'red' actions allowed.everything else remains the same as current player corporations.so what's the advantage of an ltd? there are two:1) ltds cannot declare war or be war dec'd2) players in ltds cannot shoot eachother freely (so no awoxing)corporations (incs) remain exactly the same as they are today.players may freely move between npc corps, ltds and incs, but: if they drop from an inc (to run from a wardec, for example) they get a one week cooldown before being able to join another inc. yes this would also nerf 'serial awoxing' but i think it's only fair: if recruiting somebody is not to be taken lightly, so should joining a corp.all this means:a) if you are a new player or a casual player you stay in an ltd in highsec. you can mine or pve all you want. you can enjoy the game alone or - better - with like-minded friends without risking wardecs or awoxing. sure, your isk is nerfed but your player experience is not - you still get to do all the game activities you want except pirating and space/structure ownership. obviously you still can be suicide ganked or bumped or scammed - you're never 100% safe in eve.b) if you don't want any nerfs to your isk or pos/sovreignity you join an inc., fully accepting all the risks that come with it. and hopefully not whining about it anymore! :) also, the current 'pirates that hide in npc corps' will probably have to take some additional risks too, which i'm sure they don't mind at all.advantages for 'carebears':- a bit more safety from the more experienced/high sp players- the ability to form a 'carefree' group without having to triple-check new recruits- for aspiring ceos, the opportunity to develop their 'soft skills' (group management, keeping everybody engaged, etc.) without having to also worry about more experienced players giving you a hard time. they can then 'upgrade' to leading an inc when they feel they're ready for the up-scale risk/reward.advantages for the 'tough guys':- nobody will accuse you of 'griefing newbies' anymore! and let's face it, all tears are nice but true helpless newbie tears aren't that tasty - better to focus on the guys that think they're so good at this game but really are not... - i'd expect many more players joining incs because of the isk 'greed', so: many more wardecs! just think about incursion runners for example... either they stop making ridiculous money or they put their shiny ships to good pvp use!it would be like the often proposed 'nerf highsec to the ground', only better imho: highsec is nerfed only if you don't want to engage in pvp combat. on the other hand if you are willing to risk something, highsec becomes a high risk/high reward player interaction heaven!at the same time, we could bring more people into the game who:- don't imbalance the economy because their isk is nerfed- can always be ganked, bumped, scammed and interacted with in all ways except the current two ways that are honestly difficult for a true newbie to defend against (war decs and awoxing)- have a strong incentive (isk) to gradually become less carebear and more badass eve playerif i got this right, i'm pretty sure both 'tough guys' and 'real newbies' could support the idea. i also suspect professional carebears' (meaning: risk-adverse experienced players 99% focussed on isk-making) will probably not. as a way to make this more viable avoiding 'carebear riots' , ccp could introduce the npc and ltd nerfs gradually, like 20% taxes initially, 30% after 3 months or so etc., to give isk-makers time to better adapt and also have fun manipulating the economic side of things (which i also consider a great form of pvp interaction).two final words:1) apologies if this has been suggested before, i did do some searching but maybe missed it2) i'm sure i also missed a ton of possible drawbacks and loopholes... if you like the general concept, any ideas to tweak or improve it would be greatly appreciated"
2/15/2014,"why not completely change how boosts work?make them modules that require targeting. give em adequate range, naturally.the targeted ship gets the boosts, and also transfers the effect to all ships in the fleet command chain 'underneath'. so you need to target the fleet/wing/squad commander to give everybody boosts.. fixes all the 'off-grid' vs. 'on-grid' discussion: yeah you have to be on grid and no 'grid-fu' doesnt matter. fixes op's issue: yes if you target boost a suspect you become a suspect, just like rr. makes flying a booster ship an active fleet role: you gotta target the right person, if he pops you gotta know who's next in chain of command, etc... all the while trying to stay out of harms way. much like how logi pilots fly. applies also to boosters the usual fleet tactics: go for the enemy booster or not? send an intie or two to tackle/get warp-in/scare him off? assign a frigate or two to protect the booster? jam/damp the booster? etc. etc.. allows for some treachery: suddenly your booster guy decides he likes the other fleet more and starts boosting them!i admit to not having/using boosters myself (except when i'm in somebody else's boosted fleet) but the whole 'train/buy a booster alt, get him in the system where you're fighting, hide him away someplace and forget about it' seems a supremely uninteresting game mechanic to me. currently people are kinda 'forced' to use it cuz its so powerful and/or puts you at so much of a disadvantage if you're the only side without boosters. but i seriously doubt anyone is having fun with it!the fact that there are plenty of booster 'alts' but zero booster 'mains' should be a clear enough indication of a boring mechanic!!!edit: derp! i just realized that this could be easily exploited by having both booster and fleet commander offgrid... :) my bad.so ok, i still support the op and furthermore i'm another one of the 'boosts should be on grid' guys :)maybe a 150km area of effect around the boosting ship, limited to fleet members, would work instead?"

2/16/2014,you want to plow the fields in full plate armor? doesn't work that way chief.
2/16/2014,"it does need to be nerfed or updated to make it eazer to cash out, also another way to add more tags is to have players in fw drop rank tags, it would give a reason to hunt down players."
2/16/2014,first i would like to state that i understand the importance of an impact fighter bombers have on game play. however i do believe it is unfair that only the wealthy in eve have the ability to use fighter bombers. while i would like to see this implementation actually happen it needs to be deployed in a controlled manner as to not greatly overpower the usefulness of this particular capital class ship.proposal 1: allow carriers to deploy bombers according to their skill level in the respective carrier skill.example: amarr carrier iv allows 4 fighter bombers maximum for the archon while gallente carrier v allows 5 fighter bombers for the thanatos on the same character. (never to exceed 5 deployed bombers for any carrier in one instance.)proposal 2:allow the advanced drone interface skill regulate fighter bomber use on standard carriers in one of two ways.first: allow one fighter bomber deployment from carriers per skill level of advanced drone interfacingorsecond: allow one fighter bomber deployment for each capital drone control unit activated. (regardless of carrier or drone skill levels that would not naturally effect deployment of drones)either proposal would limit standard carriers to 5 maximum deployed fighter bombers per carrier. i believe this change will allow standard carrier pilots to be more useful in pvp and allow different strategies for the fielding of capital ships for the future. i would appreciate any insight others would have to amend this proposal or explain why this is a very bad idea. please keep remarks clean.
2/16/2014,"i think this is a very good idea and i would support it as a small corp/alliance type of person, where it would enable smaller entities a better chance against supers and the like, i am especially thinking also about the impact on sov warfare, which would shake things up a bit even with the blob... blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/16/2014,no. no no no no no no no no no no. no. no. no. no!

2/17/2014,i agree.as does ecclesiastes 3:1-8you can not do it all at the same time but you can have friends who will help you(when i was younger i was a church elder)mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>
2/17/2014,"please demonstrate the incentive that pvp players have, to pay for an eve account so that they may stare at miners persistently cycle mining lasers.note: the option to go on roams and seek pvp may be perfectly understood, yet still be rejected so this dynamic can be preserved.also, please note the ships most often cited as being capable of actually threatening pve assets in null, are also demonstrated to be unwilling to engage in an obvious losing engagement.the pvp ships, by virtue of their known presence, would act as a deterrent. sadly, this would result in virtually ensuring that they see no pvp while filling this necessary function of guardianship.a cat sits until it is done sitting, and then gets up, stretches, and walks away.a pvp player stays until they lose interest, then looks up other opportunities to find play and warps away.it is simply in their nature, and to deny this is folly.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
2/17/2014,"a carrier at max skills/fit can deploy 15 fighters (5 baseline, 5 w/ carrier skill, 5 w/ drone control units) at 52.5 dps each for 787.5 baseline dps. the carrier is cheaper, has less tank, and can deploy any other drone out there other than fighter-bombers.a supercarrier at max skills/fit can deploy 25 fighter-bombers (5 baseline, 15 w/ carrier skill, 5 w/ drone control units) at 200 dps each for 5000 baseline dps, or ~6.35x as much dps. the supercarrier is more expensive, has appreciably more tank, and can only deploy fighters or fighter-bombers.under your proposed new mechanic, a carrier fit for maximum drones could deploy a mixed squad of 5 fighter-bombers in addition to 10 other drones. this puts the maximum baseline dps potential at 1525 (525 fighters, 1000 fighter-bombers), reducing the dps spread to 3.28x.i could probably calculate for the various skills and bonuses boosting drone dps, but that's what eft, evehq, etc are for.this would increase the appeal of the already-versatile carrier. i do wonder about how it would unbalance the existing capital ship hierarchy... i don't see near-doubling of carrier damage potential being good news for the crazy-expensive and decidedly un-versatile dreadnought. it would point towards a new avenue for carriers in pvp besides triage and carrying infinite sentry drones for spider-tanking efforts given the immense differences in tank between a carrier and a supercarrier, it would be sort of like the ""tier 3"" battlecruiser-vs-battleship tradeoffs (or the new destroyers-vs-cruisers)... a lot more damage potential, but still can't fully punch above your weight class one-on-one pos's (already easy targets for capital blobs) will be that much more vulnerable with carriers able to hit harder than normal at less cost than dreadnoughts and with longer legs"
2/17/2014,i appreciate your input null and with the implemention perhaps the best way to manage it is with active drone control units. meaning you must sacrifice high slots to fit 5 bombers total.....leaving options for remote reppers and energy transfers to zero as carriers only have 5 high slots. so to reasonably equip a carrier for xfer you would only be capable of launching 3 bombers to save space for 1 energy xfer and 1 shield/armor remote repper.perhaps those numbers are a bit more reasonable or equip some carriers full bombers and others full triage capable. so while a fleet of carriers is potent (as it should be) this tactic could be added as fleets wouldnt know which carrier to primary.
2/17/2014,"personally while the idea is noble, i think it isn't the best idea out there.dreadnaughts are the capital killers and damage dealers for the average pilot. when you look at most killmails after the supers and titans the dreadnaughts make the rest of the damage with the carriers at the bottom.carriers really are more of a logistic ship than a damage dealer, while their fighters can do very good damage, most of the carriers bonuses are to repping and cap transferring (depending on the race).while dreadnaughts are more expensive, they still aren't completely out of reach."
2/17/2014,numbers from eft (not sure how accurate it is):max skills thanatos with 15 fighters = 1875 dps (can't attack pos)max skills thanatos with 15 sentries = 675 dps (can attack pos)max skills thanatos with 10 fighters and 5 bombers = 3250 dpsmax skills nyx with 25 bombers = 12500 dpsmax skills moros with 3 ion siege blaster i loaded with anti-matter and siege module i = 5711 dpsthese numbers are on skills alone set to 5. (no extra weapon upgrades or drone upgrades aside from drone control units) if these are any reflection of true in-game numbers the carrier group will still be well below dreads and far below super carriers.this change would allow carrier pilots to be a fighting force for their alliances who can jump farther than any class capital and be a true asset for quick and effective strikes while being able to use other drone assets to defend against sub capital fleets. adjusting the need for high slots to deploy bombers would limit the carriers ability to be used for logistics which would be the balance effect to require a pilot to give up something for added versatility.
2/17/2014,"firstly, supers aren't even particularly expensive anymore. secondly, carriers already have a huge role in combat, well multiple roles actually, so why would they possibly need buffing further? thirdly, your numbers in the above post are completley meaningless, why would anybody use a no damage mod moros for example? fourth, why would anybody use supers if carriers could do the same job at a fraction of the price? fifth, you've just killed any point in using dreads too, well except maybe structure bashing, carriers wouldn't be stuck in siege for 5 mins with all resulting vulnerabilities and doing comparable damage.the only thing i really agree with in this post is the suggestion that fighters need some love. i'm not sure what, but, they need a boost of some kind. perhaps, fighters get damage increases from use of dda's, but definately wouldn't include fighter bombers."
2/17/2014,"just some quick questions to op.who do you think these isd's are that seem to have offended you so much?are they independent entities with no connection to the game?are they alts of ccp devs?or are they volunteers from the player base who give up their time to make sure that the forums maintain a reasonable level of civility and respect for others?i would say they are the last, you know, players with a stake in the game and who wish to give something back.yes, there are times that the moderation seems to be a bit heavy-handed but in my opinion the ccl, for they are the moderators, do a good job and i hate to think what the forums would be like without their unpaid efforts.and no, before you ask, i am not a ccl volunteer, just someone who has had reason to be grateful for the mods on these forums in the past."

2/17/2014,currently most of the threads on the first page of gd have been locked. go look for yourself.
2/17/2014,hi.
2/17/2014,this concept is awesome and perhaps an empire warfare would be necessary every few years started by ccp (like incursions) where one faction actively battles another in high sec space and shift the ownership this way ot that even into player controlled hands. this scenerio could benefit game play and perhaps see caps allowed back into empire for a set duration controlled by ccp. of course perserve parts how they are for new players and those who choose a neutral stance on the story line of what is happening. this idea could spawn into many different things but is worth pursuing. perhaps i would like to see the gallente empire pushed into making some 0.0 regions empire while losing ground where they sit. or changing current .1 thru .4 systems into .5+ and vica versa.push this to the top could be amazing.

2/18/2014,i think you should at least be allowed one name change if you buy a character from the character bazaar.
2/18/2014,"agreed, i miss it alot :(""in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" - d. adams."
2/18/2014,"well a boosted moros can reach almost 13kdps with mods which helps prove my point that unboosted it still ranks above carriers with up to 5 bombers. but thats tech 2 siege faction ammo and 3 mag field stabs ii and 2 rigs (lvl 5 skills ofc) so its not actually comparable damage.perhaps it is the fighters who need love for the carriers sake.3250 dps max on a thanatos (who receives bonuses unlike other carriers) isnt in the realm of overpowered when you are sacrificing your ability to remote rep or xfer energy. the only increased threat here are stations, other caps and finally we can hit a pos respectfully.btw what is your range of ""not particularly expensive""?appreciate the reasoning elextrix. it's pretty sound."
2/18/2014,"the only way i'd be alright with carriers having fighter bombers is if/when they sieged. allow them to fit a siege module that gives them the ability to deploy fighter bombers, and perhaps it would be alright. the truth is, i don't believe this would be a good idea, even if they had to ""siege"" for such an ability. simply put, they'd be competing with dreads but with less damage and less damage range. i just don't see a reason to give carriers more attack potency."
2/18/2014,"by not particularly expensive - i'm not saying they're cheap of course, but wealth per capita has never been higher, isk grinding is easier than its ever been, and it really wouldn't take that long to replace if you know what you're doing with isk making. if you're in a corp that supports helping members into supers it should be even easier.the problem wouldn't be that dreads don't do more damage still, of course they would, the problem would be that a carrier could do a decent chunk of that damage without dread like vulnerabilities, which is a really big deal. once you've sieged green, there's no aligning out, no rr, and at the mercy of anything that might jump in during that 5 minute cycle. a carrier with your proposal could jump in (out of the range of a sieged dread if it wished) align out, recieve reps from buddies, refit on friendly carriers which inevitibly jumped in with you, and warp out should the fc decide at the presence of a hostile cyno, it would also still have the ability to hit sub caps hard on its own too, which a dread cannot. i don't know if you've been playing long enough to remember when supers could use all drones, it sucked.for what its worth i would support an increase in fighter damage, not as high as 3250dps, or with the existing ability to assign fighters but somewhere around the 2k mark for about 10 seems ok to me. currently, they are terrible."
2/18/2014,"so what? you undock / bubble / dock up, the second later one try to warp out and gain a timer?cool but you are already in station, yet you agressed someone in a time frame that wouldn't allow you to dock?what to do, we eject you from station then?launch bubble -> gun timer. there, fixed it!"
2/18/2014,"a couple other tings to ponder: if you shoot an npc with your guns (or use ewar on them), you do not gain a weapons timer. so why should dropping a bubble instantly give you a weapons timer? if you insist that dropping a bubble gives you a weapons timer, then then everyone inside the bubble should instantly gain a pvp timer. my suggestion gives a weapons timer to the dictor at the same time that the ""victim"" receives a pvp timer (i.e. when he tries to warp in the bubble and is prevented because of it). furthermore, my suggestion solves the bubble camping shenanigans: if they drop a bubble, and you warp in it and are subsequently prevented from warping because of the bubble, the dictor gains a weapons timer. if they are docked, so what? your problem is still solved, because if they undock, they will still have the weapons timer (assuming you are still attempting to warp in their bubble), and then they will be pragmatically stuck on the station undock, inside their own bubble, and unable to dock. if you can't figure out how to solve that situation, you shouldn't be in nullsec to begin with!"
2/18/2014,+1bubble aggression mechanics are ridiculous.
2/18/2014,"this would enable gazillions of risk-averse carebears to join wardec-immune corps, rat, mission, mine, manufacture and trade to their hearts' content (thus affecting the rest of the game) and only have to worry about being ganked or awoxed. yeah, gonna say this is a terrible idea."
2/18/2014,"the concept's not bad i reckon. op's suggesting creating an actual meaningful downside to being in npc or limited corp. and a limited corp'd just be a chatroom and a logo which i have no problem with... but the safety shouldn't be stuck on green (the safety is the idiotproof switch, you don't need to idiotproof it again)other problems are that mined ore should be taxed somehow and 40-50% is way too high a taxe: oh except the problem that market taxes are bypassed by alts in full corps but w/e i like the concept if not the execution"
2/18/2014,"you haven't met many carebears, have you benny?"
2/18/2014,"problems with this proposal: 1.) safety switch set permanently to green. so, by joining an ltd, characters are unable to commit a suspect or criminal action. frankly, there is no good reason to discourage players from doing these actions. 2.) cannot be wardecced. players in highsec may mine, manufacture, mission, and haul items around. i believe that their operations should absolutely be hinder-able by player actions (suicide ganking, wardecs, etc). you need some real drawbacks if you're going to have more wardec immune corps. frankly, we first need taxes to be set for refining, sales, bounties, lps, and s&i lines for all corps. then, simply set npc corp taxes to 10-20%, and let player corps set their own taxes. after that, we don't need ltd's... 3.) nothing deployed in space: if you can't wardec the corp, they shouldn't be able to deploy any objects in space (for corp). pos are the obvious, but no poco's, no anchorable cans or bubbles, etc. they can launch items for individuals, but not for ohters. 4.) why? at the end of the day, i don't see the need for this half-step. have people gimped in npc corps, and let them take the step into player corps as they desire. it isn't hard to do a background check on an applicant, and it isn't unreasonable to expect corps to do such a thing. i see no reason to create these risk-free institutions."
2/18/2014,"these are the forum rules. there is a link just above new topic and below the search bar.threads are locked because they violate the rules. ""cynos are op"" is a troll thread and lacking content without qualifying statements about why they're op and what should be done to make them less op. furthermore, if you are making a suggestion to modify the feature of cynos - that would go in f&i and not gd.the reason threads are locked in gd is because threads like the example you use of ""cynos are op"" are in the wrong place and were likely put there intentionally to get the trolls that live there to respond with incendiary and inflammatory rhetoric.if you simply follow the rules then your thread will not get locked, you post will not be redacted, and everyone will have a better forum experience.also ib4l for discussing forum moderation.""grr kimmi nerf chans!"" ~jenn aside www.eve-radio.com join eve radio channel in game!"

2/19/2014,why not just unsuck fighters. what a novel idea.
2/19/2014,10/10 would buy that novel**4/19 **never forget <U+0CA0>_<U+0CA0>
2/19/2014,"""if you don't have a hustle and you're not space-rich, don't blame the isk, blame yourself"""
2/19/2014,"i don't have the time or patience to explain, in detail, why giving carriers in their current state the ability to deploy fighterbombers is a horrendously bad idea. so, cliff notes: there is a reason we don't allow supers to deploy drones other than fighters and fighter-bombers. a very good reason. there is a reason we don't let dreads use drones anymore. a very good reason. there is a reason why carriers have their specified, intended role in the capital tree. a very good reason. capital proliferation is bad enough as-is. giving high-sp alliances/corporations easier access to fighterbombers, regardless of place in the ~nullsec cartels~ or lowsec/facwarfare groups is a recipe for disaster and less-fun. carriers already fill a plethora of roles, some of them questionably not where the ideal carrier should be. giving them the additional dps role that should really belong to dreads, supercarriers, and (maybe) titans is a recipe for disaster. fighters have been meta-outed for a while now due to their inability to be used against subcaps to much of a degree of usefulness (or, for most of my alliance, against the red-cross menace at an acceptable isk/hr ratio). they really need to be rebalanced to be useful for defending capital groups from bc/bs gangs instead of reliance on sentry drones. adi is a skill that needs redesigning anyway. this is not the redesign it needs. i really don't want lower-sp characters getting access to fighterbombers just because they own a carrier. there is a degree of e-peening that comes from achieving the ability to field a supercarrier, and being given access to fighterbombes on that ship may as well be an exclusive perk of the craft. plus, i hate people whining about instant gratification of their goals when they realize that eve actually takes some time and investment to get to where you ideally want to be. as previously mentioned, getting a supercap isn't that hard these days. if you find it really hard to do, you're really doing something wrong."
2/19/2014,"thanks to all for your feedback.first, i'd like to further clarify my main objective, which is to make highsec a more 'dangerous' place, with more player conflict.the whole ltd idea is to address what, in my opinion, is the only reasonable objection to this plan: that it would be a bit too difficult for the new players.almost all arguments for the opposite, i.e. 'make highsec safer', fall into just two categories:1) people should have the 'right' to carebear in peace if they so wish2) the game is still too hard for newbiessadly, i often hear and read argument #2 (which is reasonable) used as an excuse to support argument #1, which imho is bullshit and would destroy what makes eve such an outstanding game.so i tried to come up with a reasonable solution to argument #2: limited companies! good for newbros, bad (i hope) for 'veteran carebears' (because of the severe nerf to isk).now i'll try to address the points you all made."
2/19/2014,"yes, you may be right and that would be a terrible outcome!but how many carebears do you know that would be willing to give up 30% or more of their income? carebearing is all about isk! again, just think of incursion runners for a moment.also: they are already doing that! by staying in npc corps or evading wardecs, with no significant downside. in my scenario, the downside for 'hiding' would be a severe hit to isk."
2/19/2014,"safety being green was an idea to make ltds unusuable by 'carebeary pirates'. it wasnt meant as idiotproofing.no need to tax mined ore if you heavily tax the sale of the ore! and 50% is reasonable for the protection you get! just think of civilian modules: they're starter gear, they're functional and yes they're terrible compared to the 'real stuff'. so are ltds: they work, ok to start out, but should be a terrible option for experienced players!and yes you're right some further mechanic would be needed to not bypass the taxes. for example disabling direct trade and heavily taxing contracts, unless they're intra-ltd."
2/19/2014,"1) see my reply to benny: ltds should be unusable by pirates/gankers2) see my reply to benny: taxing all forms of asset sale or transfer should do the trick and it's more simple! got millions of lps? good luck selling the lp store items! but if there still are loopholes, then yes tax everything! thats my point too.3) 100% agree, pos was an example. yes, surely also pocos and all4) personally i would agree with you. but many people seem to be opposed to nerfing npc corps. hell, even among current csm some are discussing removing non-consensual wardecs, for example! you're all for a more dangerous highsec, i am too, many are not. the ltd idea is an attempt to find a common ground."
2/19/2014,"1.) i understand why you want to prevent ""suicide gankers"" from hiding in your non-wardeccable institutes. however, setting up a institutes that prevent players from engaging in ship to ship combat outside of extreme circumstances is simply not acceptable. we want players to attempt ship pvp from time to time, and your new entity almost forbids it. no way. 2.) expanding the streams taxable by a corp offers more interesting corp management possibilities. and taxing npc corps 10-20% on their income streams is generally enough to get players into player corps. those that don't want to deal with wardecs or potential awoxing can pay the npc corp tax and deal with it. i really don't see the need for your ltds. 4.) to be frank, i'm not certain we need to increase the bounty tax on non-wardeccable corps more. we simply need to add similar taxes to all revenue streams and deny them the ability to use any anchorable object that cannot be immediately legally attacked. to be frank, wardecs are easily avoidable. so creating non-wardeccable corps doesn't accomplish much other than create bonafide safe havens beyond npc corps. why? your proposal does nothing to make a vulnerable highsec population. look at it this way, why do people stay in their corps when they are wardecced? dropping corp takes no time. hell, disbanding a corp and reforming it is trivial. so why do people stay in a corp and actually fight? the answer is generally to defend assets in space. as such, to have a more ""violent"" highsec, we need players to put more vulnerable assets in space. there needs to be concrete benefits to putting these vulnerable assets in space, and any changes to the game should encourage players to utilize these assets. look at t2 production. to actually participate in this level of production, you need access to copy slots. the limited number of copy slots available in highsec has resulted in 30-60 day queues on every line. this results in any serious highsec producer to operate a pos. these are nice, vulnerable assets, often with half a billion in potential loot for anyone coming along wanting to attack it. this is a good thing. look at manufacturing. there are more manufacturing lines in the forge region than in all the nullsec stations combined. the point, unlike copy and me research lines, mfg lines are abundantly available in highsec. furthermore, utilizing these lines costs 333 isk / hr. a pos uses 10, 20, or 40 fuel blocks an hour for a small, medium, or large pos, with an operating expense of roughly 150,000 - 600,000 isk / hr. you would need to run between 500-2000 lines on the pos in order to justify using the pos just for mfg. a pos will never have that many lines, not to mention having lines at the pos is extraordinarily dangerous. with me, pe, copying, and invention activities, the potentially valuable bpo's you utilize are almost always safely stored in a corporate office in system (which is an additional cost). with mfg jobs, you have to put the build materials in the pos, which makes them vulnerable to attack. essentially, while in highsec you can use a pos to manufacture, there is rarely a good reason to. this is a bad thing. look at refining. in nullsec, it is very difficult to get perfect refine, even with excellent skills and implants. in highsec, it is trivially easy. and while you can refine with a pos, the process is not instantaneous, nor low waste, making it incomparable to highsec station refining. the solution to making highsec more dangerous, is not to create more ""safe havens"", but to simply encourage people to take risks. have them want to utilize structures that increase their bottom line, while being vulnerable to attack via wardec and require some level of defense. things that should be done: for miners: reduce station refining: turn station refining into a line-job, and reduce refining to 90% yield when not refining in a pos-like structure. increase pos refining arrays to have the best yield. hidden belts: create a pos asteroid scanning array. access it, and it creates an expedition entry (in system ideally) for you to warp to and mine some newly spawned asteroids. for manufacturers: increase mfg, pe, me, and copying line costs from 333 isk/hr to 33,300 isk / hr. then manufacturing in a pos is cheaper than manufacturing in a station. yes, this means you'll have to pay 50k isk more for that 200mm autocannon ii, or an extra million on your t2 cruisers. industrialists will simply pass on the cost to all end users. but it makes using a pos make more sense. for haulers: create dynamic concord timers: a mechanic that potentially increases the concord response time when in a corp. for traders: initiate a corporate tax on sell orders, with the npc tax rate of 10-20%. for missioners: an in-space agent, allowing them to move away from mission hubs? now, all highsec players will benefit from being in a player corp. structures give them a reason to defend themselves from an aggressive wardec! they can still dodge wars if they desire, or they can utilize mercenaries and allies to defend themselves. the result is more content, more conflict, and a better game. your ltds, which preventing players from utilizing these tools results in less reasons for players to fight. do you not see why limiting utilization of these items as terrible for the game?"
2/19/2014,isd should have the ability to temp lock threads for review and that's it.
2/19/2014,"if you want examples of actual draconian moderation, you should go on any other mmo's forums for a bit and try to get away with half the stuff we do here.isd does (sometimes) a decent (every now and then) job for pretty much no good recognition. they have their bad egg moments, but as a purely volunteer staff they do a good job wearing the dual-hats of being members of our community and lording over your bad posts with a lock-hammer.ps: isd deadtear 2014, a man of the people, by the people, for the people (yelling at/banning all the people)."
2/19/2014,"how about instead, we make it so that you can inject a minimum of 3 skills, if you inject 3 and then go over the 24 hour mark, no more skills, if you inject 1 and its 30 days long, you can still throw two more in.purely because remembering wtf i wanted to train after i started training large beam laser specialization v is a pain in the ass."
2/19/2014,"you're right, that does seem like a huge problem that definitely affects many people, quick... fire up the change-a-tron!!!!![/sarcasm] if you cant remember what the next skill you want to train is... how the hell are you going to remember what the next-after-3 skill you want to train is?????jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

2/20/2014,"well, i love the idea, but with. being scripted, and removing everything after, is there a reason it needs to be the character you just made? is there no reason it could be a small demo/stand alone teaser where you just fly a lore non capsuleer pilot that suggestively dies at the end or fades to black mid fight with the current expansion slogan. remember how homewolrds demo hooked you? if not, go to youtube. i'm not saying it needs to be big, but a small download/demo that is designed entirely around the experience. while staying mostly true to eve and people are more likely to try something they dont have to sign up for 1st. the biggest hook line is not allowing someone to finish something. zeigarnik effect is a theory that says the brain is better at remembering unfinished tasks. why do you think people keep coming back to mmos or that model you never finished. basically by escalating the teaser fight (like a dread/cap fleet hot drop and the overview going mad with reds, then the fade to black. something that shows you scale but leaving a cliff hangar. and using lore makes it easier on resources. it's used very well in stories. , e.g. bad guy got away. ""finishing the fight"" in halo 2s ending. but yes to anything that gets more new people in eve. and trains them to want to stick around.support the updating of rookie ships! join the discussion"
2/20/2014,"it is now 6+ months since odyssey introduced 2 graphical effect that a sensible part of the player base would have the option to deactivate.namely, the jump animation and the system auto scan when entering space.the proposed changes are the following:1- jump animation: make it optionnal via on/off (default on) toggle like drone models, effects etc...the reason is that it make some people sick, having nausea / headaches etc....2- the autoscan when entering system should be working according to it's setting, when it's on off position, no scan at allit is not logical than a feature on off position still turns on by itself with no player control.when one does anything else than running anoms / signatures, there is absolutely no use to have this sweeping.travelling 10 jumps and seeing this useless animation every jump is annoying, chasing a ship for combat purpose is painfull when you have this animation.many players already deactivated account / stopped playing just because of those two things, and there is a 88 page thread asking for those two things.i hereby ask that the csm express a clear position on those two points, as well as bring at least the #1 issue to ccp since it does impact some player physiology, in the best delay.brseth"
2/20/2014,are you guys really arguing siege fleet as a reason sb's are overpowered? look just because you dumbasses only undock in carriers these days doesn't mean the sb is broken.i remember another alliance we fought in the last year that tried a siege fleet concept right back at us and we shut it down handily with a few rapiers vagabonds and sabres. a small gang of dedicated harassers can really ruin a siege fleets day. hell solo dudes in cynabals were giving our guys hell till i made the suggestion of sneaking recons into the fleet. stop sucking.as far as initial tackle of a bomber being op it's like you guys don't even know about interceptors and warp speed rigs. a ship that's only tank can be blown away by a stiff fart does not make great initial tackle unless you are dealing with complete morons.
2/20/2014,"these are actually all great ideas!i do hope someone in csm will present them to ccp.only thing i'm not convinced is the dynamic concord mechanic. i read your post. i like the npc corp nerf, but not sure about the corp sec status mechanic. how about making it even more nasty: if you want a faster concord, you pay for it!still a corp decision. you get, say 3-4 levels of protection, like ship insurance. basic is free, others cost more up to say 50-100 mil per player per week. yeah i know thats high but many people can afford that so it would be a kind of status symbol!about my ltd idea, yeah maybe you guys are right. but i still think inexperienced dudes could use some kind of 'starter mode' group mechanic. even if, in the end, its just a reserved chat channel and a common name of sorts (while still 'technically' being treated as in an npc corp)."

2/20/2014,"question. you write: so, you're a voice that would not normally be heard from a small bloc asking for ccp to prioritize proportional to ""what people enjoy doing."" the statement's a bit vague; for instance, are you saying that ccp should prioritize nrds and similar gameplay in proportion to the percentage of eve players who enjoy it? because that percentage is not very large. would you be focusing on high sec and nbsi null sec gameplay, since those are what most eve players seem to enjoy? if you didn't mean that, what did you mean?i ask because i like the idea that there's more than one way to do sov. it adds texture to the game, and it seems from my perch that it could make actual, self-sustaining economies (more!) possible without blueing up the whole part of space. so if i were a provident, i would want you to argue your case not for what it currently is, but for what it could potentially bring to the game."

2/21/2014,agreed. lets give us more realistic fitting options. more options for using our lp as well as encouraging the lp isk sink. i would love to see faction modules used more. without ridiculous pricing.
2/21/2014,the original bpo holders of t2 weapon systems will see their profits drop to only healthy levels.
2/21/2014,"i completely concur that faction modules could use a serious rebalancing pass. at the moment, they generally come across with somewhat jumbled attributes, sometimes being better then t2, sometimes worse, sometimes just different. i think asking ccp to spend some time rebalancing them, from their attributes to their build costs would be generally a good thing. i don't know where i prioritize it, but it is an area of game play that needs tweaking. to be honest, this is not a small project, and shouldn't be treated in such a manner."

2/21/2014,"the biggest issue i have at this point is being able to hit a pos effectively, waits for the get more friends, your space poor, blah blah blah.i think the carrier should have a fighter / fighter-bomber bay and a drone bay, i think that the number of sentries that a carrier can carry is stupid! fighters need improvement, that is for certain.in terms of the comment about some sort of siege module for carriers when using fighter bombers, why, they are easy to get a point on anyway, anything can point them unlike supers and titans, if you make it certain death like a dreadnought then no one will do it. i don't use a dreadnought simply because its just too damn vulnerable for smaller entities, i am not playing this game to feed easy kills by the way, if its certain death i don't do it, which is why i don't use a dread!fighter bombers are good at attacking certain sov modules, ihub's sbu's and tcu's, also good on stations, they should also be good on certain pos modules, which have big tanks, such as warp disruptor batteries, ecm batteries to name a couple. smaller entities would have more chances if they had fighter-bombers in carriers imo. also this would reduce the importance of supers, death to all supers and all that.in terms of supers the reason why the drones were removed was that the drones made them too difficult to hold down, they could clear off the interdictors and heavy interdictors easily on their own, now they can't and are very vulnerable and need a support fleet, a carrier can be pointed by anything, so having drones makes no difference to them, while for a super it made them virtually immune! that is why you did not want to explain it!drones on dreads made little difference, before the moros could have cleaned some small tackle, big deal...making carriers more useful in terms of sov bashing is a win win situation for small entities and will produce more fights in the game, bigger entities will take more risks with a carrier fleet and have a reason to use them still after the drone nerf is applied, when it comes. everybody moans at the amount of dps needed for sov, givving another option to apply dps on sov modules is a good thing.a carrier applies logistics and fighters and has a tank and cap to be able to survive to a degree, that is its roles, it carries fighters as its main weapon, why not a lower number of fighter-bombers.i find the comment about allowing lower skilled people getting fighter bombers on a carrier laughable, all you have to do is train fighters to 5, what the hell is the difference, i can jump into a super with carrier i, and the advantage of supers is the large number of fighters and fighter-bombers and the immunity to all but interdictors and heavy interdictors let alone the remote ecm burst.no wonder you just said no with no elaboration.as for getting a super, sorry but i don't want another account so i can baby sit a super. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

2/22/2014,hello guys. let's hope developers will notice this thread..have a good week-end.
2/22/2014,great idea +1
2/22/2014,1
2/22/2014,"now admittedly my area of experience is mostly lowsec which i understand has slightly different mechanics but, as soon as you land on grid in the carrier, what prevents you aligning off and warping off if anything decloaks? so no, carriers are not easy to put a point on. the siege like damage in a hard to catch ship is one of the best attributes of supers and should definately not be applied to cheaper ships and particularly ones which already have a huge role.they were removed because they were an i-win button that didn't require sub-capital support; something that isn't supported by ccp.just because you have the prerequisites to fly a ship doesn't mean that you should fly a ship. the difference is low skillers aren't likely to jump in a super because of the cost of a loss, whereas carriers are cheap. for smaller and less cap heavy entities things like align out speed are a big deal. so skills like capital ships 5 become more important in a super.enjoy not using fighter bombers then."
2/22/2014,"nothing prevents you (apart from a skillful bump) from warping off once you are aligned, that is the whole idea of it, i have bashed a few things on grid with a carrier such as poco's, but the low damage i can apply means that pos's are not really a good idea because i do not have immunity to the pos disruptors, so in answer to you its no different to supers in terms of sov modules except that everything can point you, but different in terms of pos's as you need to take the point modules down fast, and with fighters it is not fast. also note that you cannot assign fighter bombers like you can fighters, so you have to be on grid, and supers being immune to all but hic's and dictors have it easier. do you understand it now? when you say role, the issue arrived because ccp added drone damage modules to the game, to me a carrier applies fighters and has logistics and tank, the drone issue needs to be resolved and my preferred way is a separate drone bay and fighter bay, the fighter bombers sits well with their original role, not the sentry drone role which developed from those modules.note that i never carrier ratted with sentry drones, the reason was that they were just too vulnerable for me, i continued to use fighters and aligned out as soon as i could, this made me very difficult to catch compared to all those around me that switched to sentries, isk per hour stupidity wins eve, lol.the fact was that the i-win was down to them being able to switch to drones, clear tackle themselves and get out, which is why the drone bays were removed, because they were limited to only being tackled by hic's and dictors made it easy for them, in that respect as the carrier can be tackled by anything their vulnerability is much greater. in fact with the change to an actual drone bay, i would add a limited drone bay back to supers. (prepares asbestos suit for incoming flames...)i was replying to an earlier post, but i never said it was wise to do so and agree with your comment here, but isn't that a good reason for have a low number of fighter bombers? if you fly a super you should have cap ship 5, the racial carrier 5 and be packing the right implants. the super has other advantages, such as remote ecm burst, immunity to all but hic's and dictors and the ability to apply a large amount of fighters and fighter bombers. unless ccp sees sense, death to supers and all that! this would be a good way to open up the game a bit more in terms of the sov modules ehp and enable smaller entities a chance to kill things without making it easy for the blobs, with this change i believe that there will be a lot more pressure on those empty sov systems, lets take a group that uses a character with a cloaked carrier or two, they get control of the area, then drop sbu's and once online they use their already in place carriers that were used as mobile bases along with mobile depots with their fighter-bombers, now at last we have truly effective small group impacts on sov. maybe it will pan out that way, maybe not, carriers are cheap and effective, i have 3 on this toon alone.ccp have started to look at making 0.0 more fluid, this suggestion would be a great leveler, but i seriously doubt ccp has it in them to do this, so your little crack here may be the reality, which is why that when a certain game is up and running in 2015 i am likely to be running around on that instead. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/22/2014,"this issue needs to be addressed, i hear a lot of people in eve foam at the mouth quite rightly at pay to win, however i also find amusing that the biggest example of play to win is this, those that can afford multiple accounts have it easier. my view is that you can only play eve effectively with two accounts. in the past i used to play play by mail games, and there was a game called tribes of crane, in that game i was paying for 6 tribes and 2 political characters, which gave me a significant individual power, some people accused me of paying to win, though of course they could control npc tribes and political characters as part of their faction. the only difference i had was that my player controlled tribes and pf's were far better than the npc ones. this gets into the issue of game balance.at this point we have these mega alliances with vast isk reserves that can plex up massive super carrier fleets when they want, how the hell can smaller entities deal with that, also the production of these things is controlled as part of sov. in terms of game balance to give a chance of competing this fighter-bomber suggestion has merit.and if any of you think that 5 fighter-bombers per player in a carrier that can be pointed by any ship is the same as a super that can run 20 of them, has a remote ecm burst, has immunity to all but hic's and dic's, then i have to question the quality of your grey matter, its as stark as that. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/22/2014,"supers at about 7+ times the cost of a dread, and 10+ times the cost of a carrier have it easier? how unreasonable!you're really not making much sense, you seem to want to avoid any risks, and have the benefits of supers without the penalties such as cost and the need for another account. it's your problem if your pos bash is going slowly because of your fear of using dreads or unwillingness to invest in supers. risk/reward working exactly as it should in my opinion. when i say multiple roles, i mean carriers can do triage, pantheon, ratting, hauling all sorts, there is absolutely no reason to give them any more roles such as siege proportionate damage. again you're not making much sense, ""drone problem""...? drone assist is (sort of) being fixed and you solution has nothing to do with that so i assume you mean some other ""problem"". not entirely sure why you're smugging about being hard to catch either, it's swings and rounadabouts again, fighters suck and you're no doubt making less money as a result by not using sentries. low risk strategy deserves low level reward so that's a good thing in my book. yes, but costs considerably more than a carrier, it can't dock, has a massive bullseye on its back, requires a second account for the holder, can't be insured, can't be built without access to sov. it's very much deserving of its unique abilities.what do you mean it wouldn't make things easier for the blob too? all they would do is hit the same structures with carrier gangs too, they wouldn't bother with supers as why risk them when the carriers can do the job just as well. i share your desire for 0.0 to be more broken up and for smaller entities to have a fighting chance without a blues list longer than than this post. but what you're proposing is just bad and i'm not sure why you're so terrified of any kind of risk, if everybody was so risk averse then this would be the dullest game ever. i have multiple capitals too, and guess what, they get put in harms way!"
2/22/2014,"i really need to stop responding to you we're clearly not going to agree. this ""issue"" is where ccp is making a ton of their money, anybody who thinks there isn't a certain amount of pay 2 win in eve is naive or stupid. of course they want players with as many accounts as they can possibly encourage because it's more subscriptions to them. supers aren't the only example... scout alts, hauling alts, falcon alts, link alts, farming alts, cyno alts the list is endless. all of them have substantial benefits to the player over those without.i don't really know what to say about the isk issue, if your running anomalies with fighter carriers then i suppose its not that surprising you're having difficulty making the dough to get a super.and you have obviously completley missed the point if you think i'm saying supers and hypothetical carriers with 5 bombers are the same thing. the can be pointed by any ship argument is so weak as well, you've already said your massively against risk, anyone who roams knows what players like you are like, safe up at the first neutral in local, pretty hard to get tackled when your half way to the pos by the time the neutral has even d-scanned your general direction down. we all know what would happen - bash pos mods when local is clear, you cyno in your gang of carriers, drop fb's, align out and get out the second any possible threat is anywhere near, i mean you said yourself thats how you do anomalies! meaning your as safe as any super so leave out the bs how a super is so much safer."
2/22/2014,"ccp have said that they do not want ability linked directly to cost, in any case supers would have four times the tank, four times the damage in terms of fighter-bombers in terms of this suggestion, and they have the advantages of immunity to all but hic's and dics, and can use remote ecm burst. they will be no where near as good as supers, the damage would be 2000 dps which is double their current against sov modules, hardly game breaking is it?a dread gets a 10k dps in siege, the fighter bombers from carriers as suggested would be 20% of that, but it gives options.you talk about risk and reward, so your comments on the cfc using sb's in fountain, that was low risk wasn't it, so i am some sort of bad player for wanting lower dps for lower risk, but something better than what is possible now, yeah right!a carrier is a ship designed to apply fighters, with logistic ability and a good tank, that it has other roles within the game is how people use them, now i have pointed out that a super had 8k of damage, a sieged dread 10k and a carrier with 5 fighter bombers would be 2k, people do use carriers against pos's and structures, but currently the damage is 1k.the reduction in the number of assigned drones is a band aid fix, in reality they need to have separate fighter and drone bays, so that the drones carried are more limited. do you get that? there was a goon a week back who lost two carriers sentry ratting within a day of each other, i can assure you that i have made a lot more isk then him, and my killboard looks so much better. i play my game to be hard to kill, it annoys the hell out of certain players, but its where i get my kicks.i was talking making it harder for the blob, its really a question of numbers and vulnerability to being caught , if you are caught you die, simple as. and people will still risk supers ast they will be four times better, in other words 1 can do the job of 4 carriers and are at less risk due to their advantages which i keep repeating.i think its more options, and as for being terrified, rofl, i don't like giving easy kills and sitting there in a dread for 5 minutes is is an easy kill. sorry not for me, and yes i have had my stuff in harms way, i just don't do stupid things. and yes most people are risk adverse, that is why i almost left recently, most of the players i see in my area are waiting to cyno stuff on you, that is their gameplay, you cannot get more risk adverse than that.anyway i think for a person who supposedly wants more small entities in 0.0 you miss the point that small changes can make this happen, i think this would make a slight difference to be honest, but a step in the right direction. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/22/2014,"i have several accounts, just cannot be bothered to get yet another to baby sit a super, and you are confusing me with the op, i could buy a super if i wanted to, and i don't run anomalies with fighters at the moment, i don't need to.the being pointed by only hic's and dics is an advantage that the supers have as compared to a carrier, people had said that they would not have a reason to sit in a super, well at 4 times the ability and immunity to most ships and e-war, plus remote burst ecm to me is still a massive reason to sit in one. i called them out on that rubbish throw away line ""no reason to be in a super"" as being the pap that it was.oh yeah, i am going to sit there and let people kill me, wtf, this is why i developed a healthy contempt for a lot of eve players, so i am some sort of bad player for not letting you kill me, cry some more please. and the reason supers are safer is as i stated earlier. of course that is how i will do pos's but you do realise that until the warp batteries are down, we could have 1 or 2 carriers stuck on the pos, and you talk about the risk being the same as supers, wow.thanks for the replies, i rather enjoyed it, as it enabled me to really ram home the small improvement that this would offer in terms of dps. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/22/2014,"lol i'm not saying anybody is bad for not dying. i'm saying what the real game application of fighter bombers in carriers would be, and you know i'm right, the only reason you don't want to use dreads is because you're clearly extremely risk averse and think you should be entitled to some low risk high reward solution to your structure bashing problem. i've got news for you sieging dreads isn't insta death like you seem to think either. 5 minute cycles do not give people long to respond, and you can be in and out before somebody has noticed you and formed a response fleet let alone positioned cyno's and jumped in. amusingly considering your poor argument on how much safer supers are, they would likely be noticed much sooner as a bunch of people's addressbooks would alert them to its online presence.keep posting that only hics and dics can point supers isn't making its relevance any more important, if both it and a carrier are aligned out and they're both going to bug out once a neutral/hostile enters local or neighbouring systems, it's irrelevant. which without doubt is how you see them being used.i really don't understand how you can't see that by increasing the capital/structure bashing role of the carrier that you're diminishing the role of dreads and supers. that would be game damaging if carriers were close enough in ability that you remove the reason to use them. why risk a nyx when you can use 4 insured archons? or use a few carriers instead of a dread, with dreads it wouldn't even necessarily have to be a direct comparison in dps because of their siege cycle, if they need to be there 6 mins, they're there for 10 so a few carriers that could do it in 8 would actually be more efficient dps all of course without risking your ship. if you want high dps at minimal risk get your checkbook out or accept that the cheaper version is more vulnerable, you're paying for what you're getting. if you don't like it i'm not going to feel sorry for risk averse carebears complaining how long its taking to bash a pos.the idea that more expensive stuff is better at a job is a concept applied the whole way through the game, the more you're willing to pay, the better toys you get access to. next it'll be oh i want blops to be able to bridge my noctis to low sec, i can't afford a titan but it'll be good for the game if more ships can go through a black ops bridge. it's only a small increase to their existing role. titans will be just as useful though!i'm not sure where you've got this idea i'm totally against the idea of reducing the drone bay on a carrier from?anyway as much as i've enjoyed correcting your misconceptions, i am quite tired of discussing this obviously bad idea....discussing pvp content with carebears"
2/22/2014,"lol you think i am a carebear, thats really funny from a character who has zero kills reported on zkil, is a member of a militia and been in opposing militias, let me guess warp core stabs and a cloak and circling something for lp? oh i know you don't post with your main, lmao and don't feel sorry for me, i am taking on stain empire, and if you think that i am a carebear taking these guys on more fool you, but if you want to call me a carebear then feel free, i will just laugh. i could call you a gankbear, but that would be silly, lol.you have not proved anything about the suggestion at all, i think you are wrong, you just repeated the same points back as fact, yet when i give real numbers about dps and go through the ins and outs of their vulnerability compared to supers you ignore it, of course once aligned the carriers are likely to be safe just as supers except in terms of a pos, can't you read?supers 8k dps, dreads 10k dps, carriers with 5 fighter-bombers 2k, where is the diminishing of the role, answer that direct question, of course you would still use dreads and supers as they are more efficient, its a no brainer, there are some circumstances that you would use a carrier, it gives more options. that being said the comment about insured carriers is a very good point as compared to the nyx, this comes in at the point where you think that there is a good chance you will lose your ship then of course you will use your carrier for this, but the nyx you would use if the risk is low, so yes the lack of insurance has an impact, yet i still see people using supers instead of the insurable dreads so what gives there?as for the pos, its a very hostile system with people who can gather a larger force within the time of a siege cycle, so a dread will die, it requires a long battering of the pos to wear them down, they are lazy hot droppers.more expensive stuff is not proportionally better, that was ccp that said that.anyway we have to agree to disagree, but you call me a carebear and run away leet forum pvp at its finest, lol. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

2/25/2014,"based on the presumption that cloaking is balanced, albeit severely dysfunctional in both usefulness & weakness aspects.i would say the concept of change needs to embrace two aspects, and i would suggest a method.aspect one: cloaking must remain a valid play choice. this said with the understanding it is broken from the perspective of a cloaked player.we do not live on a chess board. the bigger ships relying on brute force for combat defense have no need for concealment.the smaller ships may choose to be exposed, but they all need a defense capable of making them interesting to fly.aspect two: cloaking must never be an ""i win"" button.we will always have players who are more clever than the next guy, and they will own the foolish without mercy if they choose.cloaking should never provide leverage enabling foolish play to have undue advantage.clever play should be the only path to this.pilot skill must be the ultimate factor in conflicts, whether cloaks are involved or not.as to the method, for every advantage or disadvantage changed from the current system, give the other side a reasonable means to counter it. do not give anyone absolute anything, save that the highly skilled and clever should only feel threatened by equally skilled and clever opponents.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
2/25/2014,it is worth mentioning that faction weapon bpcs are another isk sink and require multiple sources of labour to create. if should face a rebalance then including data/relic site materials would be a good addition on top of mining and tags.
2/25/2014,"i doubt it tbh. faction weapons generally use less cap and fitting, and have a lower skill requirement in return for a little less dps, no t2 ammo and less availability. most doctrines will still be based on t2 imo."
2/25/2014,"with your suggestion, carriers will have a much larger tank, a larger engagement range, and twice the dps of a bs. i'm saying that isn't acceptable, and needs a valid drawback if you are going to boost carriers so much. an appropriate drawback is to immobilize the carrier for attacking. this doesn't work for your desired implementation though, does it. you want a ""i'm not stuck here for 5 minutes"" dps platform that outperforms bs's, and i'm not ok with that... at all!"
2/25/2014,"your comparison works for dreadnoughts, they have a much larger tank, a larger range and 9 times the dps of bs.carriers currently have about the same dps against bs and structures, we are talking about increasing their damage on structures, after all fighter-bombers cannot hit bs can they?and the valid drawback is that dreads are still 5 times better than 5 fighter-bombers and supers 4 times better.and if you say immobilize carriers then immobilize supers, personally i think this whole immobilize thing to be a sitting duck is stupid. well lets look at your logic, supers and titans out-perform bs and they are not immobile, where is your logic, oh but dreads that do 5 times the proposed damage are immobile so every ship has to be like that, what about making every ship immobile while you are at it. i am after options for smaller entities and this is one of the changes that could shake up eve, not create more easy kills for the blobs, well go figure...as it is fighter-bombers, they have no impact on sub-caps, zilch, rien, yet the best you can come up with is make them immobile, its a depressing thought that your alliance who i had a lot of respect for has someone in it that wants easy gank type kills, sad to see it.. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/25/2014,"super and titans cannot dock. pilots are stuck in those ships until the ship dies. that is what they sacrifice to gain the extra potential. siege and triage modes give massive benefits to their ships in terms of tanking, ewar immunity, and functionality, but come with the ""sitting duck"" dilemma. agony is a small entity, and when we drop capitals we know that bigger fish may come and destroy our stuff. we understand you don't like the sitting duck drawback, but that is the cost for the enhanced performance! and you might be thinking in terms of ""smaller"" entities, but you have to look at the big picture. do you know what a slowcat fleet is? it is a large fleet of remote rep sentry carriers. you want to double their potential dps, without drawbacks, because you think it will help out small entities? your change has repercussions throughout the game. only one of your suggestions has a valid drawback: you must fit drone control units to utilize fighterbombers. why do carriers need / deserve a 100% increase in dps output towards structures?"
2/25/2014,"supers and titans deserve and get the extra damage and potential, the proposal makes no real difference to that.of course i know what a slowcat is, i want to see carriers have a separate fighter and drone bay, remove this excessive number of drones and in return give them a bit more power against structures by choosing to pack fighter-bombers. i was wondering if you knew what slowcats were after you suggested that having fighter-bombers would double the potential dps of slowcats, which are as you correctly stated sentry focused carriers, most of them hardly have any fighters on board.why do carriers not deserve an increase in dps against structures?and by the way i am not the op. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/25/2014,yes please !
2/25/2014,oh well so if i ecm burst or smartbomb and there is no one around it shouldnt cause aggression either but it does.its a broken mechanic dude.activating the launcher should cause aggression.
2/25/2014,"the quickest and easiest fix is to apply the same mechanic other area effect modules have, no activation within 5k of a station or a gate just like smartbombs. so if you want to bubble the station, you have to be far enough away to be target-able and kill able before getting back to the safety of the station. the station can still be covered, just no easy safety"
2/25/2014,"only smartbombs and some anchorable objects have this penalty. ecm bursts, hic bubbles, dic bubbles, etc, don't."
2/25/2014,~troll alert~woop woop woop woop
2/25/2014,"either allow turrets/missiles the assist options or remove them from drones. make people play the game....but in all seriousness, remove drone assist completely and adhere to the same rules as turrets/missiles. fighters and fighter bombers should be the only assistance able ships as they follow different rules (e.g. are piloted manned fighters) support the updating of rookie ships! join the discussion"

2/26/2014,some input on aggro mechanics would be helpful. lets keep the ideas coming in.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
2/26/2014,"they make defending space way to easy, with any fleet can hop regions in minutes."
2/26/2014,"i realize fighterbombers would primarily be good against structures or stationary targets. the slowcat would rarely utilize them against ships, but much of the sov level fights involve shooting 100m ehp structures, and the extra anti-structure dps would really increase their utility. i wish carriers had more conservative drone bays too. separate fighter hangars would be the proper course, imo. frankly, because carriers are already very powerful ships. the anti-structure dps would have them encroach on dread territory. and the mobility & range they already enjoy when deploying fighters already gives them a nice niche to declaw pos's from a safe distances. furthermore, the ability to assign fighters gives them yet another means to somewhat safely contribute to extra dps to small scale engagements. many people, myself included, believe that capital rr is too potent, and makes carriers moreless overpowered. perhaps the fighterbomber option would be more reasonable if carriers fighterbomber control range was less than 150 km's (pos disruptor range), and if capital rr & triage (with 4x rr ability) were rebalanced so rr is 1/2 it's current rep rate, while triage increased rr 8x instead. until the imbalances around carriers are addressed, i just don't think increasing their utility is a good thing!"
2/26/2014,"that was a much better, from the start i wanted the carriers to have a separate fighter bay to the drone bay, and i still have to go back to the difference between a siege dread and a carrier with fighter-bombers, 10k vs 2k.my suggestion within the op's proposal would be to stop carriers being used as sentry drone boats, but increase their ability in terms of fighters and fighter-bombers, no other changes. i suggested this because i felt that the game would be better with a more focused carrier. the question of impact in terms of making it very easy to take down towers is one issue, so you range suggestion is a very valid point, but i still think the rr is ok for small fleets, it gets an issue at the larger scale, but for my part i want the carriers to be a threat to supers and titans if packing fighter-bombers, but they would be very brittle with the right sized fighter bay which should be limited to 12 fighters and 5 fighter-bombers, so super smart-bombing would clear them out effectively as a threat. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/26/2014,"and since thats an issue with supers and titans what does that have to do with carriers and why does it require them to be able to fulfill a role they werent designed for??even looking at it purely from a game balance perspective its still a terrible idea because it makes dreadnoughts a massively inferior choice for the one thing theyre supposed to be best at. why would i use a group of dreadnoughts to shoot a structure when with your change a carrier group can do it in much greater safety (no requirement to use siege mode plus the ability to refit off each other for escape) with a minimal extra investment of time and resources (higher buy in because you need a couple of extra carriers to match dps numbers and you spend slightly more on fuel, compensated by not needing to buy strontium to fuel siege mode and spending nothing on ammunition ).in essence you're just adding to the problem of a group of carriers doing a bunch of different things better than the ships that are supposed to specialise in those things."
2/26/2014,no and simply no
2/26/2014,"using caldari as an example, the base cargo of their transport ships are:badger - 3900m3 tayra - 7300m3charon - 785,000m3there is imho a clear need for a ship sitting between the industrial class and the freighter class vessels, my proposal is that it would be circa 75,000m3 base cargo capacity, being 10x the industrial class and 1/10th of the freighter class. as to what the remaining attributes and fitting options for such a vessel might look like, i hope more experienced players than myself can suggest some informed ideas about the final look of such a ship, but my ideas are:base cargo 50,000m3 to 75,000m3similar fitting options to an industrial class, e.g. tayraalign time and warp speeds half way btw industrial and freighter valuesnew skill for piloting, with the same skill related ship bonuses, i.e. capacity and velocityjax"
2/26/2014,orca
2/26/2014,"i don't feel that there's a need for more industrials with a generally huge capacity.that said, there's certainly room for more specialized haulers. the gallente have 5, including three that have particularly huge specialized cargo bays, each of which break the 50km3 mark (after skills). right now, the only other specialized hauler is the minmatar hoarder, with it's ammo bay. as such, in terms of parity, there's room for as many as 8 new t1 haulers, which would make 5 for each race. proposals involving suggestions for specialized bay types to go in these slots are likely to be looked upon more favourably than yet another request for a bigger hauler."
2/26/2014,more space! i want more solar systems.there is defiantly room for improvement on this part and would be awesome with thousands of more systems.could also be all 0.0 space for what i care. it would make room for more alliances in 0.0 and or grow the existing ones.
2/26/2014,"introductionany veteran pilot will tell you that the merciless and cruel universe of eve is the only true sandbox out there, a place where you can set out to be whatever you wish, as long as you have the patience and the skill to do so. they will go on saying that it<U+FFFD>s way more than just a game, tell you about their latest adventure or link the eve is real trailer, and shed a tear. this is however not how a new player will see the game. to the newcomer, eve looks over-complicated, boring, and populated by jerks and scammers.the current new player experience (i.e a 15-days trial spent running tutorials) does a good job at showing what eve looks like on the surface : a huge universe, a ton of ships, decades worth of skills, many different professions, etc. but it doesn<U+FFFD>t give any long term realistic vision of what eve is really about. the new player hasn<U+FFFD>t been encouraged to team up with other players sharing the same interests, knows nothing about the dangers awaiting him right next door, or what it means to be a full-time industrialist, a w-space dweller or a lowsec pirate.i believe many new players stop playing after their 15-days trial simply because they didn<U+FFFD>t feel welcome in the game and didn<U+FFFD>t get to see its true potential. of course, eve is a very open sandbox game, and it<U+FFFD>s normal to leave a lot of its content hidden for the player to discover by himself, but right now the new player experience hides way too much. the game must remain the unforgiving place where stupidity is severely punished, but i think it wouldn<U+FFFD>t hurt to be a tiny bit more helpful towards the new players.i would like to propose a set of ideas that might help in getting new players more interested in the game and give them a better chance at surviving, thus making them want to play long enough to actually discover what makes eve so enjoyable and unique.1. extend trial periodfirst of all, extend the trial period to 21 days (28 with buddy invite). eve is a game that requires patience and time, and this should be reflected by the trial. however, the first 15 days (or less, if the new player wishes so) of this extended period should be dedicated to learning the game, as i will explain next.2. training constellations & reworked tutorial systemin each of the 4 empires highsec territories there would be a constellation (or more if required) which would be accessible only to pilots / accounts that are less than 15 days old. these constellations would be connected to the rest of new eden via the chat system or the mailing system, but would otherwise be entirely closed pockets following special rules designed to provide a safe environment for new players to learn the game, where it would be very hard for a player to abuse another. each training constellation would have its own separate market run by npc only, separate agents and standings, no player-run corporations, mission sites that can<U+FFFD>t be probed, no pvp mechanic of any kind, etc. no assets or isk could be transferred between these training constellations and the rest of new eden. that<U+FFFD>s not exactly compliant with the great open sandbox that eve is. however, a new player could, in such an environment in which he would only be for a maximum of 15 days, learn properly the basics of the game, be encouraged to try out things and cooperate safely with other players, and be prevented from being abused by older players - he<U+FFFD>ll have plenty of time to experience that later.the tutorials and lessons available to the new players inside the safe zone would teach them the basics, show them what they can do and how to get started, and most importantly, cooperation would be strongly encouraged. a <U+FFFD>party-finding<U+FFFD> system could be imagined where players can find other people to run the tutorials with. i won<U+FFFD>t go into detail about what the tutorials should be about exactly, that<U+FFFD>s not the point of my concept here.as an incentive to stay in the training constellations and learn things, each tutorial completed would reward the new player with a certain amount of points (with extra reward if completed in cooperation with other players in order to encourage teamplay and social connections). all the points collected during their stay would be spent upon exiting the constellation, to receive ships, modules and isk on the outside. it has the benefit of making new players want to run a lot of tutorials, try everything out with no long term consequence. and when they finally get out into the <U+FFFD>real space<U+FFFD>, they can pick assets from a list of available stuff that will be useful for what they actually liked doing during the tutorials.in addition, this system will give new players motivation and time to make new friends sharing the same interest. when they leave the training constellation, they can do so with their newly met friends, and team up from the beginning to survive in the harsh reality of new eden.[continued in a 2nd post, it<U+FFFD>s a bit lengthy :)]"
2/26/2014,"3. sponsoringolder players (say 2 years+) could be allowed to pay a monthly isk fee (yes, pay, to discourage abusing) to be registered on a sponsors list. new players would be offered the opportunity to browse this list and chose a sponsor based on his interests and the description he filled upon registering. the new player and the sponsor would be introduced to each other and have a privileged way of communicating (special chatroom, or maybe just evemails ?) for the duration of the new player<U+FFFD>s trial. upon completing the trial or when he choses to dismiss his sponsor, the new player could leave a rating and a comment about the sponsor, for other new players to see.i<U+FFFD>m sure there would be a lot of older players interested in taking someone under their wing and answer their most basic questions. it might not be as reliable as a good tutorial, but it brings a human dimension, which is capital in a mmo game.conclusioni am leaving out some details on purpose, like <U+FFFD>how does a new player exit the training constellation? via a special stargate, a clonejump ?<U+FFFD>, <U+FFFD>can a player return to the constellation after leaving it ?<U+FFFD> or <U+FFFD>would there be tutorial agents outside the training constellations ?<U+FFFD>. these are details that must be carefully thought of, but don<U+FFFD>t really impact the concept as a whole.so, what does all this do ? well, in my opinion, it changes everything. instead of having a lonely noob thrown naked on day 1 into the most complex sandbox ever who will get abused of killed within a few days and quit forever, you have a 15 days old pilot starting his life in new eden with a minimal understanding of the game, a few assets he handpicked, a goal of his own and probably a couple of friends. he will still be an unskilled noob who will make mistakes, regret choices and lose everything he has, but at least he<U+FFFD>ll have a chance of knowing why and what he could have done differently, because he was given the time to learn properly.i strongly believe this will help in making new players interested in the game and wanting to stay. i am open to suggestions and critics. if this idea gets support, i<U+FFFD>ll try to work out more details and refine the concept a little bit more.thanks for reading."
2/26/2014,overall a good idea except that tutorial agents are used for additional faction standings.how ever i believe the starter area can be 1 overall area.the 14 day account age could help from old people from making a new character on their account but not it the make a new account to get into easy groups to start awox and ransoms.
2/26/2014,"that's not what they're for and i wouldn't take that into account when designing tutorial agents tbh. and i also suggested that there could still be some tutorial agents outside training constellations. it's not really a key point of the concept.you will of course never be able to prevent an existing player to make a new account and pretend to be a beginner to start abusing others. but the idea here is to make training constellations a place where it is hard and not profitable to take advantage of noob players. there will be less abuse if there are less means to abuse others, and safer rules allow for more encouragement to learn and teamplay with others. people bullying beginners will always be there, and that's fine really. i just think discouraging them from doing that in the 15 first days would help. past that point, it's all good :)"
2/26/2014,"i know that, hence the suggestion on a fix. just treat the deploy-able bubble like a smart bomb, leave the hictor and ecm burst as is. that or if your not in space, the bubble pops, like you loose control of drones."
2/26/2014,"i get it. i'm not sure how it would be implemented but it would have to be quite a radical overhaul of how things are done now. as it is i don't think the player base would be willing to accept such a change, but perhaps one of the newer mmos coming out will do something like this."

2/27/2014,"the reason for faction prices being so high is you don't need the advanced training to use the but they can function on around that if t2. t2 ammo isn't all that, it's very limiting except for so missiles, there is no middle ground for a lot of t2 ammo, which is also why faction ammo cost more than t2 ammo. example is artillery has quake at a very short range, then tremor at very long range, on the other hand you can get every flavor of ammo type as republic navy and have a wide range of distance and damage types"
2/27/2014,"i personally think jump bridges are a good thing. i think the ability to take ""alternative"" routes to encircle your enemy is awesome. what needs to happen is a mechanic that limits how much jump travel you can make in an hour or a day."
2/27/2014,"jump bridges really don't take all that much off normal travel times. as i mentioned in marlona sky's teleportation thread, if you're trying to cross from one end of the universe to the other, even the best jb network in the game will only save you 1/3 of your time.also, since jbs are fixed in place, they aren't nearly as disruptive as, say, titan bridges. they're also a lot softer targets than titans, and can be disabled with a lot less effort than it'd take to eliminate a titan (much less multiple titans)... or, better yet, camped, and thus rendered temporarily nonusable, in the same sense as any other gate could be."
2/27/2014,"it's very interesting that everyone keeps pointing to individual things that can do and conclude that aren't overpowered. yes, and as my post says, if could only do a few of those things they would be pretty balanced in my opinion. it's the fact that sb's can do all of them and are such a short train that makes them need rebalancing.a lot of you have also grossly misunderstood what i meant about good against small ships. it's almost like you guys read that tagline and didn't read the part where i talk about initial tackle for gank, not 1v1 (though i have linked a very successful solo sb pilot, as tangential as that is).let's start with the very first part, where i answer your very first question.now go read the rest of my post to answer all of the rest of your questions."
2/27/2014,"you didn't and that doesn't show it to be over powered. it just shows you whining over a mechanic you don't understand. simply tackling a small ship doesn't make the bomber over powered. without other ships, the bomber is as good as dead. give me an ab af and i'll kill 10 bombers by myself easily."
2/27/2014,"is there any reason why the missile skills are harder to train than other turret skills? for example, when i train for small autocannon and artillery specializations, i would train the relevant projectile turret skill to 5 then train into the specialization.now when i want to train for either rocket or light missile specializations there is no 'small missiles' skill that builds into those specializations, i would have to train both rockets to 5 then light missiles to 5.this seems massively unfair on those that use missiles. it seems like the obvious thing to do would be to change it so that the individual missile skills (light missiles, rockets, heavy missiles, heavy assult missiles, cruise missiles and torpedos) should be replaced with small missiles, medium missiles and large missiles and keep the specialities the same"
2/27/2014,"its simple really, surprised that you cannot see it, and even more surprised that you cannot work out why they are called carriers? the suggestion is that they carry fighter-bombers too and a limited number at that.you are not looking at the game balance, all you can say is ""never meant"" but when you look at game balance you have to assess the impact it has. dreadnoughts will still have their use, they are five times the dps in siege, still a damn good reason to use them. also fighter-bombers are not cheap either.they are carriers, why would they being doing a role they were never intended to do, also dreads do 5 times the dps so its not better, the only thing they have going for them is survivability... and it adds options for smaller groups, simple as and taht is game balance. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/27/2014,counter-proposal; give me a reason to even bother going there without offering higher rewards than other parts of the game.
2/27/2014,you actually do realize that most of null sec space is barely used right ?and that ccp is planning (inb4 walking in stations disaster 2.0) to implement player build stargates which lead to undiscovered systems..........................also wh space.the low class whs are barely used as well.and basically what caleb said.empire space sadly is still one of the more profitable regions for individuals...
2/27/2014,ah yes the undiscovered systems that i do look forward to. empire space is pretty decent in profitability that's true. and also 0.0 entities could also just easily conquer any more normal 0.0 space added to the game. i guess im just so tired to watch the same entities ruling 0.0 all the time.
2/27/2014,"you are right, it should be made consistent, either apply the current timer mechanic like smartbomb, or the one i propose to all those.consistency is great when it comes to aoe mechanics (hictor bubbles too indeed)regarding hictors, what is the curent game mechanic?if you use focused point, you got timer, but if u use bubble mode, you don't?would be odd, since in 1 case, you prevent 1 ship to warp, but in the second, you might prevent 10 or 100 from doing so...."

2/28/2014,"i totally support this. i'm new to eve (3 weeks now) & never got to experience these agents & missions. i can tell you with the current setup after finishing the aura & career agents i was totally lost. it was a serious ""now what"" moment. i knew the basic ""mechanics"" of the basics. i didn't (& probably still don't) understand the political mechanics & undertones between factions. i had to search around wikis to figure out where to go. i think there is a huge gap after the career agents. i really enjoyed up to the career agent point, then i almost quit. i forced myself through the steep learning curve & i ""think"" i'm headed in the right direction at this point.anything to help new players (like myself) with the intimidation factor of this game is a good thing.p.s. i'm still trying to figure out how to crack the whole storyline thing. i did one sister of eve ""epic arc"", but now no-one wants to talk with me. i think i've read i get only 1 storyline quest for ever 16 grinding missions. seriousely!? is there a good story to this game? i hope it's not just grinding."
2/28/2014,"michael tiernan,thanks for showing support for this proposal and welcome to eve.i understand your situation and agree that the game basically places you into the deep end with no direction after the level 1 soe epic arc.for a good story plot within this game you might want to check out some of the other event agents. i have most of them listed in 'the plan' along with some tips and guide links.try not to get discouraged. this game get's a lot better after you've put in some time.dmc"
2/28/2014,"given that ccp have never provided a single response on a single thread related to the idiocy of the current afk cloak mechanic in the last 8 years i see little chance that they will extract a digit and respond/comment now.i am glad to say another brainless ****** has decided to start camping my current home system 23.5/7 - this has now been going on nearly continuously for ~5 months in all nearby upgraded systems. each person finally works out it is a useless griefing tactic that eliminates pve and pvp content, just in time for the next **** to appear.....and on that happy note ccp and csm can continue to ignore the most commented long-run issue in the game without a single attempt to improve it..."
2/28/2014,"frankly, i don't know the details of your camper, nor do i honestly care to.i would suggest, however, that they have either called your bluff, or they are themselves bluffing.by this, i mean to say that they are implying that they have the means to cyno in additional forces at just the moment where your ships would be vulnerable.considering that unless you are mining in titans, or some equally ridiculous high value target, they probably have not the means nor motivation to actually back that up except at specific times, so you can call their bluff most of the time.now, if you show up in some easy to kill soft target, then they only need a relatively trivial force to handle it. such forces, i would expect, are easier to come by and should be considered available more of the time.so, when you call their bluff, make it with something they think of as a hard target. put in that nice cyno jamming tech so only covert cynos can be used too.if they feel an absolute need to attack, make sure they need to drown in the isk required, while you are out only what you can easily afford.many battles are won and lost on excel docs, with ships never appearing. make the numbers work for you.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
2/28/2014,easy to come up with ways to catch them once (or twice or three times) ...involving other players and ships... then they re-ship and are back in 10 minutes.... there is no counter that works for months until ccp bother their butts and think. 0.0 is a waste of space full of station spinning players
2/28/2014,"i don't think you don't have a problem with the mechanic, i believe you have a problem with your expectations.now, you imply the problem is the possibility of other players showing up when you are not ready.i agree.but, rather than the other player being limited as to when they can show up, i would much rather see you less limited about when you can be ready.i feel that we log into mmo games to interact, not to avoid others, or we defeat the purpose of playing an mmo at all.i think we should look for ways to allow players to be ready for interaction better, not be incentivized to avoid each other.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
2/28/2014,cloaky ships are balanced by the simple mechanic that when uncloaked they are extremely easy to kill. what the carebears are complaining about is that they can't dock up their little ratting ship at the first sign of threat and have a way to stay hidden in their station until said threat goes away so they can go back to making their isk.
2/28/2014,standard rubbish - simplistic incorrect response. no concerns about active players cloaking - afk cloaking is a pile of dog turd. someone logging in after dt then staying in system closes it down for anything other than fleet ratting or ratting in crap ships - so you might as well just mission/incursion in high sec. get rid of this pos and you will get more pve and pvp content in null - there will be people undocked worth shooting...
2/28/2014,"i feel you are being disingenuous here.you are suggesting that you are wanting to use a ship, that is simply not competent to deal with hostiles.because the hostiles that are indicated as threatening you are believed to be cloaked, you avoid them by not using the ship.you leave out this, which is an obvious detail which i feel bears stating in this context:you would avoid any hostile you believed to be a threat, simply because you are not piloting a ship you would choose to have any unplanned encounter with.cloaked / uncloaked, no difference, you want to have the opportunity to swap ships, so you feel better prepared.(i am giving you presumed intention of being willing to fight, here)i believe it is not reasonable to expect competing players to give you a safety advantage, just so you can feel more secure using a relatively defenseless vessel.i think it is more reasonable that you should play the spaceship flying mmo, in a spaceship that can deal with meeting other players.if that means we need to make your pve ship into something more practical, let's consider that direction.i feel blocking player interaction because it is not convenient for you makes no sense for an mmo.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
2/28/2014,then remove cloakers from local. problem solved. only active players are a threat.
2/28/2014,"its because missiles work on entirely different mechanics than turrets.turrets are split between ranged types, short and long, they have trade-offs such as damage and tracking. missiles are straight classed, no tracking. each missile is designed to fight a particular type of ship, not to mention that unless the enemy is speed tanking extremely well, there is no way for a missile to ""miss"" within its effective range, or score anything other than a moderate hit.the way range, damage, and general engagements work between the two weapon types is why they have different skills. missiles are inherently tools specialized for their individual jobs.sorry if post has some redundancies in it, im tired."
2/28/2014,"well, as long as bringing 10x the people to the fight is a guaranteed win, then the ones who can bring 10x the people will dominate. and as long as they dominate, people will just join them, bloating their numbers more, because joining anything smaller is pointless.this is the big counter to people who argue ""bring more friends"" whenever the arguement about sov availability to smaller entities comes up, since the game is at a point, that the large entities only real threat is from other old, large entities, no new group can really start up without eithera) not threatening the sov of the bigger groupsb) just joining the bigger groups and be pets/rentersand you cant ""make more friends"" to pose a threat, because all the friends to be made are already out in null in the big entities.and no matter how much or what kind of space ccp adds, this will always be the case. null-sec is an old guard playground, and until someone does something extremely stupid, it will remain so. hell, even if the cfc split up and went to all out war on eachother, whoever survived would be in quick order to setup as many renters and new blue allies/pets as they can to maintain the old status quo"
2/28/2014,"a good idea overall and this should maybe help out newly started players to get a possible view of things to come for them in eve when joining up with a real corp. one thing i dont like is the sponsoring, i believe a bit of self exploring and earning by themself is not bad."
2/28/2014,"to the csm and the player base,i am here today to request a simple, but high results driven request concerning the eveonline forums. more specifically i would like to focus on the ""alliance & corporation recruitment center"" area of the forums. currently, the structure and overall usability is very low. there are currently 855 pages with thousands of different threads containing the recruitments ads for corporations and alliances, pirates and carebears touting their trades, and individual players looking at options that are available for them ; however all of this is seemingly posted without any organization in mind. it can often take several pages to find a player's ""looking for"" request and then it usually is not compatible with your corporation's culture. so what we have is an outdated and cluttered resource that does not fulfill the roles it was designed for.in a game like eve where player interactions is one of the driving selling points of the game and where statistics have shown the likelihood of player retention is higher when a player has joined an active player corporation, it is a wonder why the recruitment forums have not been updated sooner.current structure:[eve corporations, alliances, and organizations center]-alliance & corporation recruitment center-corporation, alliance, and organization discussionshow to restructure: organizational topics and subtopics [eve corporations, alliances, and organizations center]corporation recruitment center-highsec- -corporation advertisements- -player request- -lowsec- -corporation advertisements- -player request- -nullsec- -corporation advertisements- -player request- -wormhole- -corporation advertisements- -player request- alliance recruitment center -highsec- -alliance advertisements- -corporation request- -lowsec- -alliance advertisements- -corporation request- -nullsec- -alliance advertisements- -corporation request- -wormhole- -alliance advertisements- -corporation request- -corporation, alliance, and organization discussionsthis is the first step, adding simple folders to help organize the massive influx of new recruitment adds. this also allows corporations and players to make searching for their new home or new corpmate easier. now instead of having to search pages to find a highsec or a lowsec corporation, a player can just open the appropriate subtopic and begin their search right away. on the reverse side, a player can post their ""looking for"" request in the appropriate subtopic which will allow them to be found quicker and easier by recruiting corporations. the above also holds true for corporations seeking to join an alliance.in the end, this is a simple and quick fix to help resolve a disorganized and painfully slow search for a new corporation. a few man hours of restructuring this one forum section and the return benefits are more active corporations and higher player retention.thank you for your time and i hope the csm and players can get behind this little fix"
2/28/2014,perhaps when creating a looking for post people could check boxes for the area's they are looking for so they don't need to create a new post in each part of space they are looking for.difficulties: corps that span multiple regions of space. not sure what the solution would be.
