It‘s worth mentioning that although we talk about "Always Show", nothing will override the settings in the Group tab. That is, if you have chosen to not see Battleships in your Overview, your fleet mate in the Raven will not be in the Overview, no matter how your state display settings are.	With this change, we've had to change the interface where you control the display settings of the entity states. The states are back to being in one list, but now you have 3 radio buttons ("Always show", "Filter out", "Show by default") to choose from for each of the states.	You can click each of them individually, or select many states in the list and set them all at once by clicking on the header icons.	![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66639/1/overview.png)
