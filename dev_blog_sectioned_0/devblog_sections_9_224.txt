9	english	 	 BLUEPRINT DATA	We've done a fairly comprehensive overhaul of blueprint stats, to try and bring them into a more consistent and interesting pattern.	Firstly, we've assigned all blueprints a behind-the-scenes rank, which dictates a lot of the values. You can see examples in Appendix 1, and here are the rules we used to determine them:	Modules: Sized 3/6/9/120, multiplied by 2.6 for T2; unsized modules are sized S/M/L by low/medium/high slot	Some modules have had their ranks adjusted to be more "interesting", principally cloaks, warfare links, mining modules and "specialist" modules that are generally intended for use on specific ship groups, such as interdiction launchers, doomsdays and so on. Still multiplied by 2.6 for T2 variants.	Ships: Sized 20/30/40/50/60 for frigate/destroyer/cruiser/battlecruiser/battleship, with industrials sized as cruisers, and multiplied by 20 for T2. Capitals are 200, except for supercarriers at 400 and titans at 600.	Charges: Sized 1/2/3/4, multiplied by 1.6 for T2	Drones: Sized 1/2/3/40, multiplied by 5 for T2	Starbase structures: Sized 20/30/40 for S/M/L turrets, 100/200/300 for towers, 40/60/80 for other structures based on CPU usage (40 is below 200, 60 is below 750, 80 is above that)	Rigs: sized 5/10/15/20, multiplied by 10 for T2	Everything else: assigned on a case-by-case basis	With a few exceptions outlined below, the combination of rank, classification and tech level determine a blueprint's stats.	Build times are generally rank * 300 seconds.	T2 ammo is multiplied by a further x10, keeping their current batch sizes	T1 capital ships are multiplied by a further x25	T2 capital ships are multiplied by a further x4 (not cumulative with the x25 multiplier above)	Components have not had their build times changed at all, as they're balanced around specific build chains	Special edition ships (including all the skins) have their build time set to 10 seconds	Note: Special edition ships also have an attribute set so that they never cost any ISK to build - The New Eden Painters’ Union still isn’t on speaking terms with the Interstellar Industrial Workers Union.	Copy times are, as noted above, always 80% of base build time. Due to the interaction of various skills, copy and build end up having the same max throughput. We may revisit this in future to give copying an additional edge.	Research times are always rank * 105 for the first level, with scaling for additional levels as described earlier.	Invention time is slightly more complex. We wanted to line the base stats up so that, assuming a 50% success rate, research time would match up roughly with build time, so a max-skilled character can supply itself with enough T2 BPCs to fill its manufacturing slots. Yes, we know invention job length is problematic. See previous point about tackling invention more thoroughly once we're done with Crius!
