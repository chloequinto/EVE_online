57	english	 	 Jump Fatigue Reductions	We are reducing the maximum fatigue cap down to 5 days (from 30 days). This means the effective maximum jump cooldown timer is now 12 hours (down from 2 days 22 hours). During the Parallax deployment downtime we will update any characters with jump fatigue higher than 5 days, or jump cooldown higher than 12 hours, to bring them within the new limit.	This isn’t the final iteration on Jump Fatigue, and you can expect to see more tweaks in the future.
