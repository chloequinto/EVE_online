106	english	 	 THE STRATEGIC CRUISER FOCUS GROUP	To help us determine how to reach the appropriate goals for the Strategic Cruiser revamp, we decided to spin up a topic-specific community focus group. The focus group concept has proven valuable before as a way of gathering community feedback with more clarity and fewer distractions. We put out a call for volunteer applications in a forum thread, and selected a group of players with a diverse set of expertise and backgrounds that have demonstrated the ability to provide clear feedback.	Like all the CCP Focus Groups, the logs of our discussions have been available for public viewing to ensure transparency. We highly encourage players who are interested in this topic to take a look at those logs to see how the discussion progressed.	We at CCP want to thank all the players who participated in this focus group and contributed greatly to refining and improving the Strategic Cruiser designs:
