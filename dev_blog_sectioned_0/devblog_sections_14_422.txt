14	english	 	 Capacitor Flux coils needed a pretty significant power boost across the board, so we are starting with that by bumping the net cap recharge boost by quite a bit and lowering CPU requirements for all variations.  We are lowering the number of named variations to two, one fitting variation and a second that has a reduced capacitor capacity drawback amount (but similar overall cap recharge).  Again, we are cleaning up the “basic” variants and collapsing them into one type.
