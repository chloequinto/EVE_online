25	english	 	 THE REST	Some features we have talked about recently but aren’t listed here may still make it into Rhea, so read the final patch notes for the full list of changes. We are also closely monitoring the results of our Phoebe changes to jump drive travel and working towards the next phase of changes to sovereignty. You can expect further communications on this topic in December.	We really hope you enjoy Rhea , coming to EVE Online on December 9th.	And do remember to pay attention to in-game news and movements, as this overview blog does not reveal everything happening around Rhea or why things are happening in New Eden!
