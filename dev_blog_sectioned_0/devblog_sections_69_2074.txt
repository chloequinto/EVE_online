69	english	 	 NOW WHAT?	The fact that we’ve now finally unlocked the possibility of having special purposed cameras that we can easily switch between has already sparked a lot of very interesting ideas, so don’t be too surprised if you’ll see some more camera related improvements in the future. There are some crazy ideas flying around let me tell you!	While the new camera remains in opt-out Beta (which, again, will be for about a month) we’ll be extra focused on monitoring feedback and making changes/fixes accordingly, so please make sure to voice your opinions on the forum thread attached to this blog sooner than later.
