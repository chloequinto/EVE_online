14	english	 	 THE STORY SO FAR	Before Tiericide, tech one ships were split into artificial “tiers” that were intended to represent a progression from weaker ships to stronger ships. Lower tier ships required lower skill levels and cost less, but were much weaker. Higher tier ships enjoyed extra slots, more hitpoints and powerful bonuses. In practice, this system presented a false choice, as everyone correctly flocked to the highest tier ships and the lower tiers languished in disuse.	As CCP Ytterbium outlined in his Fanfest 2012 Balancing presentation, followed up with multiple dev blogs, the Tiericide initiative replaced those old tiers with a series of ship lines that represented distinct strengths and weaknesses for distinct roles. Each tech one ship within the same class (like “cruiser” or “frigate”) post-Tiericide is intended to have roughly similar overall power, but that power can and should be expressed in a variety of forms.
