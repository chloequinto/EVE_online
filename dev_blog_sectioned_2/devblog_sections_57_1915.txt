57	english	 	 Defensive regeneration on Entosis targets	All structures that can be captured by Entosis Link modules will now have the ability to automatically regenerate towards defender control. This applies to Infrastructure Hubs, Territorial Claim Units, Conquerable Stations/Outposts, Station Service Modules, and Command Nodes. If one of these structures has a defender alliance, then the structure will slowly capture itself on behalf of that alliance whilst it is idle. The rate of defensive regeneration is fixed for each type, and is unaffected by any modifier such as the Activity Defense Multiplier.
