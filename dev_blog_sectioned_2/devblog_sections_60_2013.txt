60	english	 	 OVERALL PLAN	Let’s have a look at the global plan and explain the various item types that can be acquired before going into details.	The Structure Hull: the most obvious piece to the feature, a structure hull works on the same manner to a ship hull by having various slots, attributes and bonuses tailored to a specific purpose. For example, Citadels, the first type of structures to be released, are specialized into defense and various corporation support roles.	Modules: these are structure modules that fit into a structure’s high, medium and low slots. Similar to their ship module counterparts, they require powergrid and CPU to be properly fitted. Active modules also require capacitor, fuel, or both depending on the circumstances.	Service Modules: these are unique modules for structures which give them capabilities you would expect on regular stations like manufacturing, research, reprocessing and market for instance. These also are going to require powergrid and CPU on top of requiring fuel to be activated. The structure hulls, unlike Starbases, will not require fuel block to be operational -- this is being moved into service modules.	Rigs: again similar in functionality to what’s currently available for ships. The Tech I structures we are going to release are all going to have 3 rig slots, with 400 calibration. Fitting rigs consume calibration and require the matching hull size. For example, one cannot fit a medium rig into a large citadel. Rigs also give unique bonuses to activities installed through service modules. More details on that specific point will be unveiled on our next blog which will cover structure fittings and bonuses.	With this in mind, let’s go over them one by one.
