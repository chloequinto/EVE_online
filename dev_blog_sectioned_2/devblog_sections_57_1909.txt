57	english	 	 Following on from configurable infrastructure upgrades, another requested feature was the ability for corporations to manually remove their own sovereignty structures without having to have a different alliance come along and complete a multi-day capture process. We are now adding a Self-Destruct option to Infrastructure Hubs and Territorial Claim Units. This will provide a quicker way for an alliance to tear down their assets in a solar system.	The self-destruct option requires Director roles, and will trigger a countdown similar to self-destruct on a normal ship. However this countdown is longer - it will take 20 minutes to complete. Initiating a self-destruct will send a notification to the owner alliance, which includes details on the responsible character. Any other Director within the corp can travel to the structure and cancel the self-destruct, provided he does so before the countdown completes.	As with ship self-destruct sequences, a server down-time will automatically cancel any ongoing countdowns. This is intended to mitigate out-of-game issues such as unpredictable patch times from interfering with the ability of owners to abort a self-destruct.
