The Scope Network will offer you several optional challenges that they are distributing to capsuleers - if you complete them they will offer you new challenges, and if you leave them be they will expire after 3 days.	As you complete challenges, you will see your points total increasing and how many remain until you unlock the next reward. Your progress on challenges will be logged so you can take a break whenever you like and pick up again when you return. For the Shadow of the Serpent we will also have special rewards for the capsuleers with the most points earned during the event!	Remember, the challenges in the images are just prototypes - we don't want to spoil the surprise!  We are excited to see how the Shadow of the Serpent goes and will be eagerly awaiting your feedback so we can work with the Scope Network to try new things for the future!
