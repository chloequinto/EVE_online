74	english	 	 TQ TECH III THUSFAR	A few days have now passed, and we already have had one brawl in Hakonen where 1500 pilots fought, which ran on one of the 25 “standard nodes” of TQ Tech III. The 6 reinforced nodes of TQ Tech III still remain to see proper action so we wait eagerly to see how they perform	We saw reports of both good positive and negative feedback which obviously helps us tweak and fine tune the hardware.	To illustrate the improvements here are graphs of wisdom from CCP Quant!
