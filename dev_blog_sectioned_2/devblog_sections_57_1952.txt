57	english	 	 THE DATABASE CLUSTERS	Currently we have three main production DB clusters:	TQ (2x cpu w/ 32 Hyper Threaded cores)	Web (2x cpu w/ 24 Hyper Threaded cores)	Account Management and Payment (2x cpu w/ 24 Hyper Threaded cores)	All three are on very different types of hardware, spanning multiple generations of architecture, and mostly held together with Minmatar duct tape, soulful Amarr prayers, the naïve and hopeful Gallente spirit, and low-grade mass-produced Caldari chicken wire from upgrades over the years.	With our New TQ cluster, we're looking to consolidate and free up physical space so we'll be combining Web and Account Management and Payment clusters while we keep TQ separate.	For CPU's we are upgrading from ancient 5 year old X7560's @ 2.26 GHz to brand spanking new E7-8893 v3's @ 3.2 GHz. That's a 45% increase in clock speed alone, and on top of that we get a huge 75% increase in memory bus speed by going from 1066 to 1866!!  Make no mistake, we need all that extra memory speed as we go from 672GB of RAM to 1.5TB, yes you read that right - 1.5 TERA bytes of RAM!  That’s how we roll these days, we count our TQ hardware memory in terabytes!	Keep in mind these numbers are just from active nodes, so the New TQ DB cluster total is double this when we factor in the secondary / passive nodes. 3 TB of RAM for our 2 production DB Clusters--mmmmm, tasty!	 While we had discussed having a single two node Active-Active cluster, we decided against this for various reasons. For example,  with one cluster.exe crash the whole shebang could go down.  Having the TQ DB cluster isolated gives us great peace of mind across the whole system.	With that said, we have 4 amazingly powerful DB machines to host our two clusters and have come up with a very interesting plan in an attempt to maximize redundancy.
