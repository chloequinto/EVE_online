Notifications will be sent for those particular states to make sure people can respond and defend their structures in a timely manner.	Any external party to the corporation will only be able to see the timer related to the current state. For example, a scout may learn the structure is in reinforced state 2, with 5 hours left on it by going to the solar system where the structure is located. However the same scout will not be able to guess how the vulnerability window is weekly set. In the same manner, we want to avoid automation for this particular information, which means not displaying it in the API, since we want people to actively scout, or infiltrate spies in the target entity they wish to disrupt instead of relying on external tools to do the job for them.	Structure brackets are going to be visible in space and in the overview if:	The user can interact with the structure in question. A structure set to accept neutral parties will be displayed publicly for such pilots. Another structure set for alliance use only will not appear to any neutral pilot at all.	The structure itself disrupts the user in any way. An Observatory Array having adverse effects on a pilot ability to probe or scan will appear to anyone.	On top of the points above, all structures, no matter their size or role, will have warpable signatures like cosmic combat anomalies. None of them will need to be probed to be warped to, even if the user doesn’t have direct access to them. This will ensure pilots can quickly see what’s happening in their surroundings without having to use probes, and thus not having to give their position away to the inhabitants.
