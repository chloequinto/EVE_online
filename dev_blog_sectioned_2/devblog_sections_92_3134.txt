92	english	 	 ADDITIONAL SECURITY – AUTHENTICATOR	An optional feature that pilots can also utilize to provide an extra layer of security is the ability to activate the Authenticator via account management, which overrides the location based verification system described above.	The authenticator allows pilots to utilize their mobile device to receive verification codes via Google’s Authenticator app, instead of them being sent to their account’s verified email address. 	When using this system, a verification code is requested every time a log in is attempted, unless the pilot marks the device they are logging with as safe using the “Don’t ask for codes again on this computer” checkbox when entering a code.	Any other device which is not marked safe in this manner will request a verification code every time a log in is attempted in order to increase account security.	Additionally, if a pilot misplaces their mobile device and has the optional Authenticator enabled, there is the option to receive Authenticator codes via email to prevent a pilot from being locked out of their account and allow them to disable the Authenticator service until they locate their device or replace it.	Emails for this type of code will have the subject line “Your Verification Code For USERNAME” so that they can easily be identified.
