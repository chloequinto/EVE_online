111	english	 	 RELEASE DAY FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS	Q: What will happen to my current Reaction jobs at Downtime on Release Day?	A: They will continue to run until Downtime on Release Day, but will be stopped at this point. They will not be able to be restarted in a POS array.	Q: What will happen to my current POS array?	A: POS Reactor arrays will remain anchored in space but will be offline after the Release. Your Reactor Arrays will not be able to be onlined again. No new arrays will be able to be manufactured and no new arrays can be anchored. Any jobs to manufacture arrays that are running at the time of the release will continue to run (will not be paused or cancelled) and the arrays will be delivered to the manufacturer once the job has completed. It will not be possible to anchor or online these arrays.	**Q: _What do you plan to do with this defunct equipment in the future?**_	A: As we have done previously, a compensation plan will be put in place in the future to reimburse the investment capsuleers have put into this equipment.	That's all for now. Be sure to add your feedback to the Comments section of this devblog. Fly safe!
