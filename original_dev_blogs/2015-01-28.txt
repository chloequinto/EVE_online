We are just getting started this year, and the Tiamat release brings on February 17th both quality of life changes and some significant next steps on the developing story of New Eden. Log in, undock and go find out what is really going on! Here are the features coming to EVE Online in Tiamat:  

New NPCs with new abilities

Smarter and more cunning adversaries will begin to appear after the release of Tiamat. You should make sure that you keep an eye on what they're up to, and make sure that you stay locked and loaded whenever you come into contact with them. Things are moving in New Eden, be sure to follow in-game news and uncover these features in-game.

Minmatar Tactical Destroyer - The Svipul

The stance-switching tactical destroyer provides defensive, propulsion and sniper modes with different bonuses that can be switched between on the fly. Read all about this new ship in CCP Fozzie's latest dev blog: The Republic Strikes Back: The Svipul Tactical Destroyer and Projectile Changes in Tiamat.

Projectile Weapons Rebalance

Tiamat brings balance changes to Autocannons, Barrage ammunition, and Small Artillery modules. Read about the new module stats and provide feedback in the comments thread for CCP Fozzie's latest dev blog: The Republic Strikes Back: The Svipul Tactical Destroyer and Projectile Changes in Tiamat.

Option to have CONCORD intervene in internal corporation conflicts

With Tiamat, corporations can choose to have CONCORD intervene in acts of aggression between corporation members. The setting can be changed with a 24 hour notice and it will be visible to people joining a corporation if CONCORD intervention is active or not. Read more about this feature in an upcoming dev blog.

Corporation Management Quality of Life Updates

The corporation member list can be filtered, mailing lists can contain 5,000 pilots, the corp description can now be edited with links and other formatting options, closing office rentals is made easier, and a custom message can be added to rejected corporation applications, along with other smaller changes. Read an upcoming dev blog for a presentation of the changes and eventually the patch notes for the full list.
