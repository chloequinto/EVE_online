An infamous nursery rhyme that sends chills down the spine of youngsters across the Amarr Empire, this tale speaks of Bloody Omir, the leader of the infamous Sani Sabik extremist cult, The Blood Raider Covenant.


After rising to power in YC84 upon successfully eliminating any rivals for leadership within the Blood Raiders, Sarikusa conducted a ruthless purge of the organization, over which he now assumes complete control.

Famed for their kidnapping, blood-letting and ruthless raids into space belonging to the Amarr Empire, the Blood Raiders are feared across the cluster, which has led to Omir Sarikusa being branded the most wanted heretic in the Amarr Empire for preaching an alternate take on the Amarr faith which is deemed heresy by the Theology Council.

With the Empire in a state of disarray after the loss of Empress Jamyl I and the Golden Fleet feeling the pressure from the presence of Drifter incursions within Imperial Borders, the Blood Raider Covenant has chosen the prefect time for tactical strikes against the Empire.

Will you assist them, or try to quash their heretic preaching and vicious raids into the Empire?
