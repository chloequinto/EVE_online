Greetings Capsuleers

During the EVE Keynote at Fanfest 2016 (you can watch it here), we announced the results of the Council of Stellar Management (CSM) 11 elections. If you didn’t see them then, here are the results again:

Innominate
NoobMan
Jin'taan
Fafer
The Judge – Permanent Attendee
Kyle Aparthos
Bobmon
Xenuria
Mr Hyde113 – Permanent Attendee
Gorski Car
Aryth – Permanent Attendee
Nashh Kadavr
Steve Ronuken – Permanent Attendee
Sullen Decimus


If you are looking for contact details for the CSM 11 members, you can find them here. Keen observers will also notice that we have four permanent attendees rather than just the two announced at Fanfest.

For those not familiar with the CSM, the are a player-elected representative body for the players to CCP. CSM members are involved in ongoing discussions with developers about the game and future changes that are being planned, bringing both community feedback and expert opinions. Part of the council is also flown out to CCP Iceland twice a year for a multi-day summit with the development teams. To learn more about the CSM, head here.

For those of you wanting to see the votes themselves, they can be found here, alongside the code (in Python) used to run the election. The election is run using the same system as last year, the Wright STV system. One thing to note is that one of the candidates withdrew before the results were announced, and as such was withdrawn using the built in mechanic within the vote tally script. (More details on the formatting of the .blt file can be found here in section 3.1). A copy of the audit log with the candidate not withdrawn is also included with the above package.

In total, we had 22,345 votes cast in the election for CSM 11. This is lower than last year, and while we don’t judge the Council’s effectiveness only on the total number of votes cast, we do take this as a sign that we need to make improvements in how CCP works with the CSM and how we promote the elections.



We also had a drop in the total number of candidates running from last year, but at 53 players still had a healthy variety of candidates to vote for.



Here’s the breakdown for voters by country. As usual, United States has a strong showing with the United Kingdom and Germany close behind.



The majority of accounts that voted this year were created after 2012, with the highest number coming from 2013.

As normal, we saw the most number of people voting on the first two days of the election. Unlike most years though, the second day of voting saw a significantly higher number of votes than the first, but this was due to server issues that also affected the voting portal on the first day of the elections.

We’re looking forward to working with CSM 11 over the course of the next year to help us make EVE Online a better game for everyone. We hope we’ll succeed in keeping you all better updated with the process and we know the CSM are very keen to increase the visibility of our work together this term. A big shout out to those who voted and those who helped spread awareness of space democracy, such as EVE Vote Match, CSM Watch and more. Upwards and onwards!
