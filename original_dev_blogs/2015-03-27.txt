Hello pilots,

CCP Leeloo here to remind you that during Fanfest 2015, CCP Seagull announced the election results for the 10th Council of Stellar Management (CSM10). For more information about what the Council of Stellar Management is, check here.

During this year’s election we used the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system as per our tradition since 2013. This means that all CSM members below have received the necessary amount of votes and all are equal members of the council.

Steve Ronuken - @fuzzysteve
Sion Kumitomo - @siggonK
Sugar Kyle - @sugar_kyle
corebloodbrothers - @corebloodbro

Results

We had a record 100 applications this year, from which (also a record) 75 candidates were approved for the final ballot. Almost all rejected candidates did not submit their identification documents.

Eligible voters cast 36,984 votes, meaning that we have 15% increase since the last year’s election. We have also noticed a 3% turnout increase since last year and it’s a nice trend that we hope to keep for the next election as well.

The average age of users who have voted was 34 years, and the average age of an account was 3.8 years, a 0.2 year increase from the last election. 96.31% of voters are male and 3.69% are female.

Comparing to the last year’s election we saw two spikes on the first and last two days of the election.

Despite a higher turnout, we noticed a drop in the amount of votes from our localized communities, which we consider a result of a lack of CSM delegates from said communities for the past few years and thus a drop in interest.

We are hoping to make the information about CSM more accessible to our localized communities.

As usual, raw data is available for downloading.

On behalf of CCP I would like to thank the delegates of CSM9 for their hard work over the last term and congratulate the newly elected delegates of CSM10 on their new roles.

We would also like to thank everyone who participated in voting this year. Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback about the Council.
