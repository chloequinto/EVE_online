Hello Capsuleers!

This is CCP Terminus bringing you another devblog, this time covering our continuing Module Tiericide project. For reference to what the Module Tiericide project is all about and what that will mean to your modules please refer to CCP Fozzies previous devblog here: Rebalancing EVE, One Module at a Time. The Proteus release on January 13th will see the second round of this work, with changes to 10 different module types of various categories.

MODULE NAMING
We’ve looked at the feedback from the renaming we did in the first module pass, and we agree we may have gone too far in stripping out the lore and history from modules. However, we still value the information given by the new module names, and as such we will be creating a hybrid naming structure incorporating the two.

Each name will now consist of three parts: flavour name type name

For example, the Type-D Altered SS Overdrive Injector and other meta 1-4 Overdrive Injectors will be combined and renamed the Type-D Restrained Overdrive Injector. This keeps some of the flavor name, while adding in the specialization name informing you of its focus.

In addition, All flavor names will be consistent if paired with a specialization name meaning all Type-D modules will be Restrained. This adds further consistency to the naming system and prevents knowledge of one naming section from conflicting with another.

These changes will be retroactively applied to modules which have gone through the tiericide process in the past to keep everything consistent.

MODULES AFFECTED THIS ROUND
There will be 10 modules types affected this round, which fall in to 4 basic types: Harvest Equipment, Hull Upgrades, Propulsion Upgrades, and Engineering Equipment.

Harvest Equipment
Mining Lasers

Mining Lasers have had the number of modules reduced significantly. In addition, some ease-of-use balancing has been done, for instance on the mining laser range, to make them easier and more intuitive to use for newer players.

Name	Meta	Powergrid Usage	CPU Usage	Activation Cost (GJ)	Optimal Range (km)	Duration (s)	Mining Amount (m3)
Civilian Miner	0	2	65	20	10	60	30

EP-S Gaussian Scoped Mining Laser	1	3	65	20	16	60	50

ORE Miner	8	4	80	70	16	60	65
Gallente Mining Laser	8	3	60	10	10	60	45
Mining Laser Upgrades

Mining Laser Upgrades (MLU) for both ore and ice have received the same treatment. Lower tier MLUs have been consolidated into one type. The two higher tier modules have been given storyline status to illustrate their rarity and strength, and given a 1% boost to their mining bonus. Drop rates and locations for the storyline modules have not changed.

MLUs - Ore

Name	Meta	Powergrid Usage	CPU Usage	CPU Penalty (%)	Mining Amount Bonus (%)
Mining Laser Upgrade I	0	1	30	10	5
Elara Restrained Mining Laser Upgrade	1	1	35	8	8
Mining Laser Upgrade II	5	1	40	12.5	9
'Carpo' Mining Laser Upgrade	6	1	35	6	9
'Aoede' Mining Laser Upgrade	6	1	40	8	10
MLUs - Ice

'Anguis' Ice Harvester Upgrade	6	1	35	6	-9
'Ingenii' Ice Harvester Upgrade	6	1	40	8	-10
Hull Upgrades

Expanded Cargoholds

All Meta 0 Expanded Cargoholds (Alpha Hull Mod, Marked Modified SS, Partial Hull Conversion, Type-E Altered SS) will be consolidated into the 'Basic' Expanded Cargohold. Given the 'Basic' Expanded Cargohold has a lower Cargo Capacity bonus than all other Meta 0 Cargoholds (with the exception of the Marked Modified SS) of 17.5%, it is advised that you do not have a full cargohold with these modules fitted while in space on Proteus’ release.

In addition to the module tiericide, a new faction module has been added to the Expanded Cargohold lineup. This module will be available from the ORE LP store and/or as a drop.

Name	Meta	Structure Hitpoint Bonus (%)	Cargo Capacity Bonus (%)	Velocity Modifier (%)
Civilian Expanded Cargohold	0	-30	10	-20
Expanded Cargohold I	0	-25	17.50	-15
Type-D Restrained Expanded Cargo	1	-15	22.50	-13

'Basic' Expanded Cargohold	6	-10	17.50	-20
Limited Expanded 'Archiver' Cargo I	6	-15	27.50	-10
ORE Expanded Cargohold	8	-20	29.00	-10
Nanofiber Internal Structures

In addition to the module tiericide, 'Basic' Nanofiber Internal Structures will be losing the Hull Upgrades I requirement. This keeps them in line with other 'Basic' modules by having low overall power, with low fitting and skill requirements.

Name	Meta	Skill Requirements	Structure Hitpoint Bonus (%)	Velocity Modifier (%)	Inertia Modifier (%)
Nanofiber Internal Structure I	0	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-15	7.75	-13
Type-D Restrained Nanofiber Structure	1	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-10	8.50	-14.5

Domination Nanofiber Structure	8	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-15	9.50	-16
Republic Fleet Nanofiber Structure	8	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-15	9.50	-16
Reinforced Bulkheads

The most significant changes to Reinforced Bulkhead balance will be the slight increase in the Inertial Modifier. This penalty will be increasing slightly in order to add more significance to the stat and allow for greater variance. All modules still fall between the 1% and 5% Inertial Modifier increase. Reinforced Bulkheads II gain the largest penalty from this, keeping with the theme of Tech II modules having the most power outside of faction and storyline modules, but with the largest drawbacks. In addition to the rebalancing, two new faction modules have been added to the Reinforced Bulkhead lineup. These module will be available from their appropriate LP Store and/or as drops.

Name	Meta	Powergrid Usage	CPU Usage	Structure Hitpoint Bonus (%)	Cargo Capacity Bonus (%)	Inertia Modifier (%)
Reinforced Bulkheads I	0	1	35	15	-10	3

ORE Reinforced Bulkheads	8	1	35	27	-6	4
Syndicate Reinforced Bulkheads	8	1	35	27	-10	2
Propulsion Upgrades
Inertial Stabilizers

In addition to the module tiericide, two new faction modules have been added to the Inertial Stabilizers lineup. These module will be available from their appropriate LP Store and/or as drops.

Name	Meta	Signature Radius Bonus (%)	Inertia Modifier (%)
Inertia Stabilizers I	0	10	-16.75

We will be taking feedback into account for all modules and there may be some further changes between now and the release of Proteus based on this feedback. As always, we hope you’ve enjoyed running through these changes with us, and we look forward to hearing what you have to say in the comments.

CCP Terminus and the whole CCP Module Taskforce
UPDATE:
Based on feedback and further tweaking, we've made the following changes to some modules. These changes are listed below, and take precedence over the statistics above.

Capacitor Power Relays

Name	CPU	Shield Boost Bonus (%)	Capacitor Recharge Rate Bonus (%)
Type-D Restrained Capacitor Power Relay	4	-8	22
Mark I Compact Capacitor Power Relay	2	-10	22
Type-D Restrained Capacitor Power Relay – Shield Boost penalty decreased from -10% to -8%
Mark I Compact Capacitor Power Relay – Shield Boost penalty decreased from -8% to -10%
The Shield Boost Bonus error has been fixed. Type-D and Mark I modules had the value reversed.

Expanded Cargoholds

Name	Structure Hitpoint Bonus (%)	Cargo Capacity Bonus (%)	Velocity Modifier (%)
Civilian Expanded Cargohold	-30	10	-20
Expanded Cargohold I	-20	17.50	-15
Type-D Restrained Expanded Cargo	-15	22.50	-13
Expanded Cargohold II	-23	27.50	-18
'Basic' Expanded Cargohold	-5	17.50	-20
Expanded Cargohold I – Structure Hitpoint penalty reduced from -25% to -20%
Expanded Cargohold II – Structure Hitpoint penalty increased from 20% to -23%, Velocity modifier increased from -10% to -18%
These three changes should bring the T1 and T2 Expanded Cargoholds better in line with other module types, with the T2 version of a module giving the best performance but with higher drawbacks than T1.
'Basic' Expanded Cargohold – Structure Hitpoint penalty reduced from -10% to -5%. This should allow players who care more about keeping as much structure hitpoint as possible an attractive option, at the cost of cargo capacity.

Inertial Stabilizers

Inertial Stabilizers are now consistently named Inertial Stabilizers instead of some being Inertia Stabilizers and some Inertial Stabilizers.

Name	Signature Radius Bonus (%)	Inertia Modifier (%)
Type-D Restrained Inertial Stabilizers	8	-18.50
