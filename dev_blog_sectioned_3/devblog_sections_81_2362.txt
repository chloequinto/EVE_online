81	english	 	 SEEDING THE BRACKETS	This year, we will be seeding the brackets in a similar way as to AT XIII with a few small changes:	Teams will be seeded into a standard 64 team double elimination bracket	Any teams that used a buy-in for placing in the top 14 will be seeded in the order they were placed in Alliance Tournament XIII. For example, if 13 teams buy in and the 9th placed team does not, the teams that came 10th place and lower would all be seeded from 9-13 in the order of their placing in Alliance Tournament XII.	Teams selected through the random draw and secret auction will be randomly seeded in all remaining positions through a second draw	If you’re interested in commentating but haven’t submitted your interest yet, we’re still accepting applications until July 11th. Check out the earlier announcement blog for more details.	As always, we hope you’re as excited for the tournament this year. If you have any other questions you can feel free to ask them in the comments thread, or come visit us in the EVE Alliance Tournament Discussion forum.	And remember: the best ship, is Championship.	On behalf of the Tournament team
