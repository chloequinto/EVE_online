82	english	 	 The Alliance Tournament Cup	The Alliance Tournament Cup is an ingame inventory item of which only one copy may ever exist. Every year we edit the description of the item to reflect the complete list of former tournament winners and move the item to the possession of the most recent winners.	The Alliance Tournament Cup was given to the Pandemic Legion alliance in the most recent Alliance Tournament XIII, and after the conclusion of Alliance Tournament XIV it will be taken from wherever it resides at that time and given to the AT XIV champions.
