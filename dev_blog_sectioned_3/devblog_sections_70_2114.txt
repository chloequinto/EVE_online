The fuel cost is split up in two:	One time cost for onlining, to discourage players from swapping service modules on and off to save fuel	A recurring cost, charged at the beginning of each new hour, not 60 minutes after the module was activated. This is made to simplify fuel calculation costs for the user when faced with multiple modules	Since fuel costs are tied to individual service modules, it will be possible to consume more than existing Large Control Towers, or less than Small Control Towers depending on which activities are available. Below is a list of the four service modules we intend to ship with the Citadels and their associated fuel costs.
