Great for those times when you don't have EVE installed and want to play around with a saved fit from one of your characters.	Being as awesome as they are the Pyfa team even allows you to select between using Singularity or Tranquility.	You can get the newest release put together by Sable Blitzmann of Pyfa from their GitHub releases page here: //github.com/DarkFenX/Pyfa/releases	zKillboard	Ever been browsing zKillboard and found that one fit that blew your mind as being not complete shit in your opinion?
