While some projects had demo web sites running or pre-compiled binaries/setup files we wanted to be able to run the entries locally where possible to ensure the version we were judging is what was submitted. We tried to run most of them in Vagrantfiles but even then simply understanding how each of the different languages and frameworks works was not a small task. In the future I think we will require that entries include a version we can run out of the box. For web applications this will probably mean a Vagrantfile or Dockerfile and desktop applications needing a compiled version we can just run.
