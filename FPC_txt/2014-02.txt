ccp is constantly speaking of playerdriven content well i say a prime opportunity for more of this is to let players come up with well thought out well researched ship ideas and submit them directly to ccp through some channels either through csm or create some form of means of sending in a design package with basic design ideas to ccp for approval even if they have to tweak iti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
lets get some more support rolling for this idea it is something that will benefit every single eve player in some way or anotherminers sell the minerals to industrialists to build themindustrialists sell the ones they buildhaulers make money using themand pirates get to gank themi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
ccp bro wroteways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments be it on a separate server or on tqid also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams for instance a good prize for best new team for the new eden open if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoiiits not a question of players using the proper tools its players using improper tools that is stifling the events businessas you can see from this post for example players are starting to believe that they are not allowed or not worthy of creating their own events because other players are using exclusive tools such as teleporting competitors special clients with special targeting interfaces and exclusive prizes that other event organisers cant publicly access as regular playerssomeone answering the question why dont you organise your own event wrotei cannot give away cool unique ccp ingame prizessomeone commenting on someones pvp tournaments wrotewhat makes your event better than the alliance tournamentto which the honest response was nothing and that person chose to not participatesomeone on the subject of prizes wrotei dont blindly trust the organiser of this event to pay out the prize money i do trust that ccp will pay out the prizes they advertisethis is a problem and there are several facets of it one of the fundamental concepts of eve is the interaction between players and the inclusion of the entire spectrum of outcomes of this interaction from very good making friends making a corp together cooperating to set up a starbase or outpost etc to very bad getting scammed getting ganked or awoxed etc but currently the events business exists in a realm outside of that wherein ccp arranges events that are not subject to the rules of trust if a ccp employee used his ccp character to host a lottery event it would completely suck all the customers from all new and potential lotteries because what is the point of giving your money to a lottery that could be a scam when you can just play the ccp lottery which cant be a scam the seal of approval this issue takes the form of certain events which are given access to special tools special space special tournament client special prizes unique ships and special privileges posting a thread that belongs in ingame events  gatherings into the much more trafficked general discussion for example this stamp of approval give certain events a competitive edge over other events and other event organisers suffer from the decrease in spectators sponsors and participantsthere is a solution to this problem it is both very simple and very painful for those who are benefiting from the current state of the events business the solution is as followsstep 1 firstly enforce the ideology of every player should play the game as a player when a ccp employee logs on to tranquility it is either to correct an issue such as responding to and rectifying quirks in the game engine for example teleporting a titan that was bumped out of a pos shield at an impossible velocity and cannot be chased down by a player or to play the game as a player whereby they log on to their normal player character and abide by the game mechanics like every other player anything else results in catastrophe such as the incident in the past with the ccp employee spawning t2 blueprints with his game master character to give his corporation a competitive advantage in the industryteleporting regular players to special protected solar systems or logging on to tranquility with a special client for the purpose of an event is in my opinion the very same thing as spawning t2 blueprints you are giving one event organiser a competitive advantage in the events businessstep 2 no exclusive prizes or everyone gets exclusive prizesthis builds upon the same fundamental principle of eve when you log on to tranquility and create your character you are given the opportunity to achieve any one thing that any other player has achieved if you want to fly that giant titan ship that you saw in a big alliance battle you can have that you can own the space you can build that titan you can train the skills the events business is no different you should have the opportunity right from the start to achieve the things that anyone else has achieved but you dont you can never build the largest pvp tournament in eve because the largest pvp tournament in eve is official and you are not officialand that as simple as it sounds is the solution to fixing the events business put everyone on a level playing field and their accomplishments and failures will mean something if a ccp employee wants to achieve the same things in his eve career then that ccp employee must do it through the same means opportunities and restrictions as every other player log on as a player organise an event as a player and become trusted as a player the same conditional trust that applies to all playersor the equally simple but infinitely impractical equally valid solution make everyone a ccp employee let everyone design their own unique prizes let everyone spawn special ships and log in with modified tournament clients let everyone teleport each other to polaris space if they feel that regular space is too dangerous for their event i think the former is preferable and the latter would cause chaos but they are both the same in terms of solving the problem just with different consequences
it would be nice to have periodi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
every single time alliance anything or bookmark anything comes up in a chat with ccp someone on the csm says alliance bookmarks ccp definitely knows how much players want this and its on the list
well its good to see some feedback thanks ripardi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
nerf highsec in an attempt to force people into nullseccasual players who reside in highsec outright refuse nullsec and ctas blob warfare tidi constant harassment etc etchighsec players will move onto another game instead of playing this game the way you want them toincarna 20
i dont see why that shouldnt work endlessly buffing hisecs riskreward and nerfing nullsecs has very successfully forced people out of null and into empire why shouldnt restoring the economic balance be an effective tool to restore the population imbalance
from the last csm minutes this section was not included there was instead a statement saying that this section would be released after the new yearso where is it
the statement said that it would be released after its contents were no longer ndaed that is still the case unfortunately i wish i could say more but youll understand why i cant in due course
its actually painfully easy to not hit the wrong button and jump instead of bridge darwin at work there let the strong survive
i wholly support this idea if it had jump capabilities otherwise its just easier to use a jf or a carrierbut yes moving rigged ships is a pain unless you have a big alliance or corp to fall behind i would like something for the littler guys in fact i was actually thinking of posting the idea of a smaller freighter simply due to the fact that you have two options to haul stuff the 20k m3 offered by t1 industrials for non specific cargo or 450k900k offered by freighters
great idea something that has been needed for a very long time
i like the idea but i would love to see them be able to use the micro jump drive with 50 reduction in reactivation delayother then that 1 from me
why a microjump drive travelling 100km is not important for a hauler using actual jump drives to get across many systems however is important if its to stop people from scramming you and killing you 100k wont save you from an inty
even though most of my sp and time is invested in cloaked ships i wholeheartedly support the idea of an in game mechanic that allows people to actually hunt cloaks down
most likely reason was it caused some drainage on the server that could have been freed up for other resources likepvping or such
since the jukebox was entirely client side unlike the new system which takes cues from the server it actually increased the amount of server resources used not decreasedalso their official excuse was that we dont want to do this not because it was even hard but because it was hard to get to integrated with twitch which some people use but most people dont
i think youve gone a long way to reducing the gap in the recent years with 3 implants only i think the current cost to entry is fairly decent a lot of the winning setups last year cost under 2 billion isk which i think is an acceptable price tag for a new team competing in the tournament and you can easily do 6 bc6 cruiser rush or whatever if you are struggling to find the cash to compete i think maybe refunding the plex entry cost to teams who make it past the group stages could make things more attractive for smaller teams i would like to see more trading cards in the game like the neo cards you handed out perhaps even have player cards for competing teams like baseball cards for players who have taken part in x amount of matches and have their ship history listed in the tournament having yourself added as a permanent part of the games history on an ingame collectible really excites me as a player you could also then have ingame booster packs that contain so many of these cards given out to people who compete in the tournament at holiday events and for sales promotions like a free booster pack for every plex you buy etc they would be relatively low effort to implement would just require someone to do research and type it up onto an ingame item description i also think that the prize distribution in the tournament should be changed currently there is a massive payout for 1st place and 2nd place 3rd place gets 100x less and 4th place is worthless i think this creates a less meaningful final series as essentially whether win or lose in the final you are guaranteed almost the same prize as the 1st place winner and there is everything to play for in the 2nd vs 3rd place match but 3rd vs 4th place is a complete booby prize fighting for a small amount of isk and a bronze medal if you redistributed the 50 unique frigate hulls and the 50 unique cruiser hulls to the following i think it would create more interest in the semi final set of matches and also encourage more teams to be competitive because you dont have to make it to the finals to get a prize 1st 30 unique cruiser hulls  30 unique frigate hulls2nd 15 unique cruiser hulls  15 unique frigate hulls3rd 5 unique cruiser hulls  5 unique frigate hulls4th some plex prizeperhaps have smaller plex prizes like refunded entrance fee for teams who make it past the group stages again by spreading the wealth of victory slightly more outside of the finals and into more places i think more teams will think they have a shot of winning and getting yourself on a ingame item and being part of history even if you end up going 02 in the tournament is attractive to some playersprehaps you could have a little cup or newbies cup or something that only allows x year old accounts to compete and players who have never competed in a tournament before obviously this may involve having to look at ips  hardware ids to try and prevent smurfs and a lesser prize such as pirate faction rookie ships etc at the end you could also just have a tournament that only allows ships which are in easy reach of newer players like t1 cruisers t2t1 destroyers and t2t1 frigates only contributer to eve is easy
so that just sounds to me its been ignored tbh if its been mentioned so many times and its still not implemented
hahayouve lost your mindno hell noif this happens you will see a huge decrease in active accounts
that not needed now since jetcan mining is dead what we need is a new way to steal ore from miners it could be a new module that shipons ore from mining bargesexhumers you get suspect flag
thanks ripardone of the main problems facing dust at the moment is that unkike eve which has a sense that it is going somewhere even if i personalky dont find ccp seagulls vision particulary interesting dust doesnt feel like its going anywhere interesting as it has no long term vision
really because according to your kb youre an industrial renter that doesnt have a kill to his name
i support this idea so much dnull dangerousity would still feel different from wspace but at the same time the local would slightly loose its importancealso thats a buff to bomber hotdrooooooppppssss
right but the bear tears are coming in from afk cloaking if its all hot drops its content and pvp no afking i prefer that myself
personally id be in favour of an actual pvp arena setup something like arena stations that people can dock at inside of which is a big hollow space that fights can happen in undocking into that space would be done through a specialized interface system which could be used both for tournaments and for other types of consensual pvp the arena interface would let you set up fights according to some reasonable number of parameters open fights vs byinvitation ones limitations by ship classtech as desired and so on the system should also support options for prizes and spectator modethat gives individual players the tools to set up their own tournaments up to and including everything ccp would do for the bigdeal tournaments except for spawn prizes which shouldnt happen anyway while incidentally setting up a proper system for honourable 1v1 pvp for the guys who whine about that at the same time it would still be within the sandbox people would still need to fly real ships to the arena and would actually lose them within at the very least itd also be preferable to some tournaments getting the blessing of ccp teleporting stuff out to a magical pvp instance and some tournaments having to play on singularity or similar
your idea includes the criterion that everyone has access to the same tools both in terms of prizes and location that makes sense to meim still concerned about the integrity of the sandbox i see a minor issue with introducing a feature or tool which is resultoriented rather than processorientedto illustrate the difference between a tool that enables a process versus a tool that enables a resultold probes were a processoriented tool drop a probe in a specific location hit scan the probe gives you coordinates of the signals it finds no matter how accurate or inaccurateif you want to pinpoint the signal you normally warp to the scanned location drop a more accurate but lower range probe and scan again this gives you a more accurate signal that you can warp toyou can repeat this until you get a signal that is accurate enough to place you within subwarp distance of the target generally on the same grid or in some circumstances a neighboring grid for example if youre probing for a nano ship that is moving fast which means it wont be where you scanned it when you get therethese probes were just a feature of the game that did specific things within the game engine they would return warpable spots on your map which corresponded to coordinates of some scannable object  some random offset to emulate inaccuracy there was no purpose or suggested use built into the mechanism of the probes there was only the mechanism of how the probes worked the process for how to use the toolthis meant that yes if you wanted to you could use the probes to do the thing they were intended to do find objects but you could also use the mechanisms to create different results for example you could intentionally use a large probe to produce an inaccurate signal which would give you a warpable location on your map that did not correspond to any celestial or line between two celestials an instant safespot thus ships that would fit probe launchers had some potential additional tactical abilities which happened to suit them very well you could use probes to find hidden pilots and also use them to hide yourself now thats what i call brilliant game designon the other hand new probes are the opposite drop 8 probes in a presuggested formation which happens to be the optimal formation for blanketing a system hit scan and the probes generate nonwarpable locations which represent the location of the scanned objects plus some inaccuracynext arrange the probes into a pinpointing formation there is a button which arranges the probes for you and it happens to arrange them into the optimal formation and keep scanning moving and scaling down the probes until you have a 100 signal only then do you get a warpable location which corresponds to exactly where the object was scanned with no deviationthese probes are not just a tool that you can use however you like there is no flipside or alternate process you can use to produce different results they are just the prescribed way to find hidden objects and they dont do anything else that in my opinion goes against the grain of the concept of the sandbox a resultoriented game mechanic as rigid as a minigame to put it mildly id call this trashy game design that has no place in this sandbox gameto put this in the context of your arena idea i think that the overarching concept of having a separate place unconnected to the universe outside where sterile prearranged fights can take place it kind of defeats the whole point of eve one of the fundamental principles of eve is that in order to play the game you must hit the undock button to throw yourself out into the wonderful dangerous unpredictable galaxy and subject yourself to the lingering possibility of disaster you could get suicide ganked you could have your mining picnic ruined by bumpers you could have your mission item stolen by a ninjayou have to incorporate the presence of everyone else into your gameplay considerationsrunning a successful event in the events business demands that you take these things into account if youre going to have many participants or spectators in one place you need to figure out how to minimize the risk you need to get people to spread out to discourage smartbombing you need to have a contingency in place to deal with potential suicide gankers taking out your contestants you have to think about where to host your event who is going to show up whether you need to accommodate negative sec status pirates or negative faction standing militia members you need to know what to tell someone when they inform you that they are at war with another participanti think if you had such an arena as you describe it might sterilize a lot of what makes eve into eve and if eve is not eve then it is just another hotkey mmo albeit with wonky inputs and complicated damage formulae
i get your point really but the fact of the matter is that these sterile prearranged fights already take place on a semiregular basis thats what the whole point of tournaments is maybe you dont like that idea thats fine i personally dont fly at that level either my point is that tournaments already exist they already take people out into a safe random instance to fight thats a problem for all the reasons youre suggesting but its worse since it exists right now in a ccp meddling in the sandbox senseif things were changed so that there were a small number of pvp arenas in hisec no more than 5 i think one per race plus a concordrun one then the alliance tournament and for that matter any other big important tournament would be held at a specific place in eve people interested in meddling with it could wardec the participants and camp the station trying to stop people from getting their ships into position they could attempt to suicide gank unique and expensive stuff enroute thats something that cant happen when the tournaments are exclusively in ccp hands arranged by magical teleportation the result of putting these tools into player control sure the actual fights themselves are isolated from the rest of the sandbox while theyre going on thats kind of the point that kind of even environment doesnt destroy the concept of events it gives more tools with which to enact them more ways for people who want that kind of gameplay to get involved with it and more ways for tournament gameplay to exist within the context of the larger sandbox
why everyone allways jump from afk gameplay to cloaked ships if you want to make it fare  use the same judgment to all docked and hiding in pos forcefield ships anyway i dont see the issue if someone need to leave his pc suddenly and have no idea if he would be able to return in time although i understand the desire to kill those helpless unprotected ships while someone is away
autologoff stay away with that please i am so frelling glad that eve doesnt do this st imagine you are sitting in your pos floating somewhere in hisec space or cloaked in some safespot you go chat on jabber with your coalition or are heavily discussing something on mumble or efting or checking some forums  then you tab back and you notice you have to restart the client and login you will have no idea if and what was written in all the open chat channels unless you start scrambling through the logs you will also have to wait for ewarp to finish doing its thingjust dock up when you go afk  tab out is not an alternative sorry and not everyone sitting still and watchingwaiting is an afk cloaker in nullsec please dont force me to do silly moves all time in order to stay loggedthey introduced autologoff in a game i used to play since 2003 its there for some years now and it still drives me mad even tho or maybe especially because i dont actively play it much but just log in to hang around a bit
the people most inclined to whine and cry about cloaky ships are the people who want a theme park version of eve online if ever the community has given you the impression that those sort of people are wantedneeded in eve you have been very mistaken
yes we agree on thisccp is abusing their powers to monopolise the tournament marketno i dont think the solution to one problem abuse of power is creating a different problem  you be unable to weddingcrash a tournament because the contestants just keep their tournamentfit ships in the station and if they want to be safe simply clonejump there when its time to participatein my opinion these are both equally important aspects of eve you have to take risk and you have access to the same tools as everyone else moving the offending aspect of the game alliance tournament from one to the other isnt as good a solution as simply removing the problem by having the event abide by the game mechanics that already existanother reason why your solution the pvp arena is not adequate is that it only caters to one type of event arranged pvp tournaments every other type of event that competes for viewers and participants with the offending events is going to be at a new disadvantage warp racing for example  which takes place in space and over a large number of solar systems since the goal is to warp and jump from system to system plan your route carefully to avoid potential hazards and get to a destination as quickly as possible  would not benefit from the secure environment of the arena because it would still have to happen in space and still be subject to all the risks and dangers of undockingsame with pretty much any other type of inspace event if you held a probing competition you couldnt really do it in the arena if you did one of those im hiding somewhere in low sec first person to find me and pod me gets a prize type things that would also not be suited for your arenathe inherent danger of undocking is such a fundamental part of eve that you cant just push it to the side you would be turning eve into a different game
i dont really see your point im getting heres a list of arbitrary nontournament events that would not be improved by an improvement to the tournament system therefore the tournament system should not be improvedthis strikes me as a bad point so you may want to elaborate there is a demand for tournaments tournament gameplay requires a measure of protection since otherwise you dont get fair fights you get gatecamps and hotdrops and such which are interesting but are qualitatively different from the kind of content people are looking for in a tournament setting that measure of protection is currently only provided by ccp for certain official tournaments and is counterfeited by certain other events by the method of taking them out of the sandbox entirely and running them somewhere elsemy proposal is to take some of ccps tools and put them in player hands as a strict improvement on tournaments being exclusively ccprun i dont have a position on all the other possible events players might possibly want to run aside from not everything needs its own dedicated subsystem that said this particular kind of content kind of does need a particular subsystem to exist at all and so i support putting that gameplay in the hands of more people the kind of people who will proceed to play arena games exclusively and never venture out beyond the boundaries of hisec werent ever going to join your other events anywayas a side note the idea that a pvp arena into which two people or fleets undock and one is guaranteed to be destroyed being less dangerous than other kinds of events is somewhat bizarre this isnt the vr combat simulator proposal if you want to get into a fight in the arena then youre either winning or losing your ship barring a few rare cases which legitimately end in draws
soas i continue to read this thread over ccp wants more tournament style gameplay readily available for anyonewell this is an option ive thought ofwhy not do arena based pvplet me explain this conceptmake a really big station somewhere where exactly i dont know and when i mean big i mean several hundred kilometres its a station but inside the station is an arena a really big onemake the arena the only instanced place in evepeople formup make teams in a fleet they randomly get pared up against another fleet either frigscruisersbcs only or mixed fleets killmails work the same but location is shown up as in the arena killboards will more the likely poke their sites to show statisticsevery weekendother weekend have mini tournaments setup through twitchtv also have players host eventsfights on ccps twitchtv channel obviously trusted players more gameplay tournament style fighting readily available for everyone
i think the mechanic here thats broken is the fact that a fleet can have 100 people in it sitting onin a station and be endlessly bubbled by a single norisk interdictor that has macrod the act of undocking dropping a bubble and redocking all without having to worry about dying despite being endlessly outnumbered and right under the nose of a fleet that could kill a dictor with even just a sneezeobvious techniques to kill said interdictor involve using remote sebos to try and boost the scan res of a fast locking ship capable of alphastriking the dictor or smartbombs both techniques are defeated by the fact that the invul timer for the dictor just flat out doesnt allow anything to ever happen to it on many stations the undock range wont come anywhere near where smartbombs can reach because of the restrictions on using smartbombs near stationsthe only mechanic right now to deal with the bubbles is to have a stealth bomber counter the bubbles using a bomb this only helps get the bubbles down though as the invul timer on the dictor still keeps it 100 perfectly safeis this considered abuse of a mechanic or this intentionally allowed gameplay
minigame isnt the answer definetly not miners especially those in lownullwh dont need another thing to keep their eyes off of important aspects of the game  dscanlocalintel channels besides having to transfer ore from ore holds to cansore holds if you want to mine effectively using hulksfyi not everyone is a retrievermackinaw miner who can afk for 30 minutes on end
it wont even be more isk just more minerals if you flood the market with minerals the price of minerals drops the best way to increase mining profits is to have massive ship destruction like br5 thereby increasing the demand for minerals

tldr  change tsm to make it so max shield recharge is at 0 as well as shield breaking pointthe tactical shield manipulation skill reads as follows skill at preventing damage from penetrating the shield including the use of shield hardeners and other advanced shield modules reduces the chance of damage penetrating the shield when it falls below 25 by 5 per skill level with 0 chance at level 5this in theory is a good idea it allows shield tankers to absorb the maximum amount of damage upon their shields before their softer armor comes into play however the skill itself gimps passive shield tank and since it is required to train for multiple necessary modules you cant avoid itthe problem arises from the fact that passive shield recharge is highest at 25 shields a shield tank will actually tank more damage by having this skill at 0 because the shield will be at its max recharge point for much longer since the skill is required however most pilots cant take advantage of their max shield recharge for very longmy recommendation is that the function of the skill changes slightly in addition to reducing the chance of damage going to armor the skill reduces the max shield recharge point from 25 down to 0 in the same way that the skill works now in this way even in the face of overwhelming damage the shield can provide a little additional damage absorptionthe description would probably read something likeskill at preventing damage from penetrating the shield including the use of shield hardeners and other advanced shield modules reduces the chance of damage penetrating the shield when it falls below 25 by 5 per skill level with 0 chance at level 5 additionally the point of optimum shield regeneration is lowered at the same rate giving the capsuleer the highest shield regeneration when their shields are close to failingthoughts right now tsm is useless except as a prereq for invuls etc this skill would make it valuable to have at level van additional way of making it a little more powerful would be to stretch max regen all the way from 25 on down but that might be a little op
someone didnt think that thought through considering the crow especially which runs at damned near 5kms would take about 20 seconds to get there which means youd be screwed especially since the most favored crow fits favor a long point which runs about a 24km range so with that in mind in about 15 seconds youd be pointed and would stand no chance of escaping even with maxed navigation skillsjump capable maybe in a t2 variant later down the road but first it would be nice to get a standard variant so that people could just haul their fittedrigged ships with some form of defensive capability tank andor ewari am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
you seem hung up on the word tournament would you feel better if i called it racing tournament or probing tournamentyes this type of gameplay you are describing is qualitatively different from the type of gameplay that happens within the rules game mechanics of eve ergo its not evei dont know what high sec has to do with this most events are held in high sec but if you have evidence that there is negligible overlap between spectators and participants in tournaments versus spectators and participants in other events then please present it as it would contradict my personal experience in running eventsthe same people who watch my events and compete in my events also watch and compete in socalled tournaments that means tournaments are in direct competition with events and as such it is unfair that one should have access to tools which protect the participants from outside influence while the other one does not as an event organiser i lose isk when a socalled tournament happens because the people who show up to my events are also the people who show up to tournamentsyes perhaps your arena idea would cause ccp to stop teleporting people but in the same way that building a baseball stadium might stop the neighborhood kids from hitting baseballs through your window its an overcomplicated solution to a problem that is behavior the simple solution is that they just stop doing it and then theres no need to spend lots of resources on building a stadiuman environment in which you are guaranteed that a there are no surprises hidden link ships hot drops logintraps etc and b no strategical advantages such as fortifying a position where the enemy has to come to you through a gate through a jump animation through an undock procedure etc doesnt sound very dangerous to memore importantly it doesnt sound like eve
ah i see your position is that you disapprove of tournaments entirely and want them to not happen given that this is a thread about suggesting possible improvements to the tournament system stop having tournaments is not really a constructive or helpful suggestionthats not to say that your point is completely unreasonable but given that ccp had a csm session specifically about tournaments and this thread was specifically framed around brainstorming things like ways to increase interest in tournaments ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournaments and ways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments its pretty much a given that tournaments are here to stay and that ccp is open to the idea of giving players tournamenthosting tools indeed its quite likely that theyve already started coding improvements to the tournament system and are looking for feedback on how open those tools should be madethats why i suggested what i did given that tournaments are going to continue happening the tournament tools used to support that should be open to all players to the point where people can engage in casual 1v1 duelingstyle arena pvp using the same system after all its the same dev time thatll be going into the system anyways and theres certainly people whod appreciate the use of those systems outside major sponsored tournamenttype events so why not give them the use of thatbecause i dont like fair fights i dont want people who like fair fights to be able to enjoy fair fights is definitely an answer to my question but its not enough of a reason to cause ccp to shrug and stop doing tournaments in all seriousness i get your point but you havent answered my question what can happen in an arena into which undocking is guaranteed to result in either a kill or a shiploss which is less dangerous than undocking anywhere else if you undock into normal space your ship may be destroyed at any time if you undock into an arena your ship may be destroyed if you fail to destroy your opponents ship what makes the arena less of a risk what is the arena player not risking that any other player isbecause i dont want to involve myself in using a proposed new system i stand to lose competitive advantage against other people who would do so is also an answer to my question and its an even worse answer ccp will implement new systems which they feel will generate interest and subscriptions for the game making pvp more accessible to new players is something which is likely to contribute to thati shrug every time anyone suggests anything that will make eve more accessible theres always people who argue against it purely because they dont want eve to be more accessible to be sure a good part of eves appeal is its unforgiving nature but at the same time eve wont grow if it doesnt let new players in there needs to be a balance and i really really dont think the existence of optional pvp arenas in hisec is something that will totally ruin the game forever that said there will always be people who feel that any arbitrary change x is something that will totally ruin the game forever so if you remain unconvinced thats your prerogative it seems rather likely that some kind of tournament system will be showing up before too long so nows your chance to lay out your own view of how youd like the tournament system to be implemented continuing to object to the existing system will not cause it to be removed from the game so if you really think that this is a problem you need to reconsider your approach
i nominate it to become 72 hours rather than 24hrsits that easy folks
i nominate that the 24hours is working well it was and still is a perfect solution to the 3am skillqueue wakup alarm that we used to have to go throughjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
this is new and exciting
no
i added minmatar deadnaught v my skillqueue is over 4 weeks
i still have 25 days on marauder level 5 and 30 days for minmatar battleship level 5 and 20 days for trajectory analysis level 5 etc etcwhats the problem here
i have a skill that sets mine to 62 days and 10 hours so really do not understand the problem heredestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
my first idea is that skill is correct if used within the median item price a bit more o less a 10 it need only to be pulled out from the scammers that use it but now in fact must believe tha it must be removed because every buy order must be fully isk covered isnt more a only scam problem it affect also the healty trader
unpossible
has very high utility the vast majority of margin orders are fulfilled a few vocal complainers on the forums do not always outweigh the many many people who have a use for the skilland since the scam only affects people who think that theyre taking advantage of another player  in effect scamming them  my sympathy for the victims is marginal at best
i said stop teleporting people that doesnt stop you from having tournaments i dont disapprove of tournaments just follow the rules that all the other players have to follow and im happyi disagree that being employed at ccp means you can play the game differently than all the other players when your gameplay is taking place in and affecting the game environment regardless of who pays your salary you can log on to the game as a regular player on a regular player character and if you want to host a tournament as that player with that player character then you have the privilege of doing so same as everyone elseif thats their decision then so be it all i can do when faced with the concept of a new feature is to look at the information provided look at the information i already have and form an opinion my opinion is that could make eve less eve and im here to play eve so that is a step in the wrong directioni like fair fights i want others to enjoy fair fights when i want a fair fight i play a game that has fair fights so does everyone else eve is not that game eve does not mechanically support fair fightsi donUFFFDt know you tell meif thereUFFFDs no difference in risk between undocking to fight and using your arena idea to fight then whatUFFFDs the point of the arena we can already undockthe rest of your idea is great an interface with brackets and signups and space for indicating prizes and tournament locations and what equipment to bring restricting who can sign up or making the tournament public and so on all that is great i would love to have that that would make hosting my tournaments so much easier
i want and bomb assist as well then i can truly enjoy tidionline by playing dota or watching a movie during the epic moments in this gameit didnt take long to locate the tracking beacon deep inside the quarters for sleepin they thought they could get away not today its not the way that this kid plays
drones have some advantages and disadvantage guns and they are purposely different animals it makes good game play what makes poor game play often happen when mechanics that scale poorly or too well rr scales too well allowing any fleet member to tank the dps of an entire fleet in most cases there is a limit where the incoming alpha is greater than the buffer of a ship but not necessarily true for capitals and supercapitals drone assist scales too well allowing one fleet member to control the dps of 1000 drones i personally would have preferred a different solution than limiting drone assist to 50 drones i would have advocated drones jammed by ecm bursts and lockbreaker bombs nullify the drone assist command so drones return to their owners control but the 50 drone limit is a more pragmatic and workable solution
nobodys forcing you to play in tidi plenty of us get around fine by avoiding these multithousand idiot meatpiles
the changes have come to mining its called getting blown up constantly so ive quit industry of aspects with the huge flood of gankersawoxors by 1 not mining publicly and 2 being in my own corp away from ever one else
i support this proposal
kali pijunngood to hear that and thanks for postingdmc
keep the support train rolling weve gotten the csms attention let everyone you know that we want thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i would like to think that this is still available this could be an awesome concept and would really work with modern mobile items have all players start at a beacon say 50 km from the cornucopia at the cornucopia there would be various cargo containers full of misc items as well as mobile depots along the radius of the cornucopia say 15 km away there would be several smaller containers with less items in them players would have to scoop and refit there or scoop and make a run for it there would be other beacons or celestial that they could warp to perhaps another outpost with loot or maybe they could warp to an asteroid belt and kill the npcs there which could drop t2 loot for the user to put on hisher ship if desiredi am not sure how sponsors would work but i am sure something could be figured out maybe a ccp member gives said player a gift from hisher sponsor maybe they could redeem item to cargoholdsome restrictions would be no cloaking devices allowed period you would have to also have a system wide effect that prevents users from creating bookmarks this would prevent people from hiding or if you do allow bookmarks maybe after 510 mins of staying out of the fight npcs police or rogue drones would come and attack to encourage you to warp awayanyways i think it would be a neat idea it could be done as a free for all or in teams of twolt
if anything i would say sbs need a slight pgcpu buff otherwise i think they are right where they should be although i would love for them to get a bonus to rockets as well
yeah than a instalocking interceptor can command every cap ship gun in a fleet on 1 target for insta blaps
nothing needs to be done about  it is pure social engineering youre made to believe that a toogoodtobetrue deal is at your fingertips and then the rug is pulled out from under you at the last minute the best way as usual to protect oneself against scams of this sort is to actually be familiar with the market if something looks off then it usually isthose who complain about the scam really need to ask themselves this question how does having the rug pulled out from under you via the scam differ from somebody simply happening to fill the buy order before you i cant think of any functional difference between those two scenarios you are not entitled to fill a buy order just because you bought some items and have them at the ready for doing sothe scam is a nonissue that people only think is an issue because a certain skill happens to be used to facilitate it i can understand why its easy to think that youre being scammed by some broken aspect of the skill but thats absolutely not whats happening the skill is working as intended and youre being psychologically manipulated its not some sort of i win button that another player can press and instantly relieve you of your isk you have to be ignorant about market conditions you actively choose at every step of the way to participate

all good points well mostly 1 against passive game play so using the same arguments against passive game play they why are we nerfing drone assist let me digress i am for the changes that are coming i think it will make combat more interesting reading the thread on it however
first off afk cloaking isnt a mechanicsecondly what is wrong with killing defenseless ships i dont see the merits of your argument anymore than someone saying nerf ship x because its causing trouble for me if you dont want a non active afk cloaker in your system you should advocate that cloaked ships are not in local that way only active ships are present problem solved
i have supported this numerous times in this thread i have also supported the need for other means of intel should local be reduced to showing only those who speak in iti also do not mind killing defenceless ships but i prefer they shoot back i like a challengeand it is not a problem solved
skill queueso youre telling me killing all of these npcs is not leveling me i quit
if you ever happen to find yourself actually flying a bomber in a pvp situation youll find that its hard enough already the moment you enter local everyone docks up or gets to a pos afk cloaking is the only method to force the defenseless ships to actually come out to get shot at eve is a game of patience it can take hours days weeks even months to finally hit your mark
keep pushing for thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
run tournaments on a dedicated server where all players have all skills maxed and all items are effectively freeor if running the at on tq then add stations in the tournament systems with all allowed items on sale at a reasonable cost and dont allow players to take anything back with them you could take this further and have items on sale at a tournament price and somehow limit spending  eg theres a price budget as well as a points budget take a look at any sports coverage and how they do the analysis in breaks in the match do this for eve there should be replays of key points in the fight and explanations of what happened and why that made a difference just have different tiers in the competition with different levels of prize  only allow alliances to enter a team at a single tier the tiers could have different shippoints limitations etc access to camera ships and overall team status for streaming purposes  that would probably imply that it would need to be a dedicated server
1 i support this 
kyle sevthanks for showing support for this proposaldmc
so yes we definitely need this however we already have this its called a carrier next someone will want to carry 5 bs then 10 then 15 when does it stop
i think you completely missed the point as stated this wont be able to launch in space and furthermore is helping round out industry to better balance with their combat counterpartsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
put gankers in the tournament since they are a legit game mechanic oh wait they cant handle being shot at
moving to nullsec doesnt really solve anything since youre going to be renting space from concordwhy do we claim a system then pay concord a fee to keep the system ours is whats beyond me i realize ccp developped it so you would still have a money sink even after you settled the far reaches of spacewhat id like is total independence from empire ie when i claim space its mine and if anyone is collecting a fee on stuff happening in the system its me not concord not ded not sisters of eve me
your another one that wants to nerf high sec so to speak we rent from concord as an isk sink which was over come by the massive alliances and coalitions if you destroy the stations which was done once in histry before ccp stopped it caused a mass loss of player own assets in the station i also have no doubt that even if this did happen where empire becomes like null with the major powers of null sec moving in it would be like pocos day 0 goonswarm swarmed empire placing as many pocos as they could at massive high taxes the stations would end up owned by the major player alliances and either ban those who arent a part of them or blue from accessing the station or you would be charges massive fees for docking and refining ratesif we did blow up stations like the trade hubs imagine the isk loss and the progress that markets would have to ultimately reset over 90 of the market is built by players im for people popping macro miners but not every miner is a macro and some of us enjoy industry and undercutting the competition in market pvpeven the csm have been against those who want to do away with empire even though its become a massive war ground while initially it will be a major isk sink but just like nullsec the player base will catch up with the isk sink and be even more powerful forcing people to takes sides as it is now to get into nullsec
you do realize that jita 44 would be nuked within minutesit would crash the game market and the tears would flow like a riverafter a dam burst its banks and taking out whatever lies in it wayalso goonswarm online your  is ours blue donut editionUFFFD is already upon us
i posted this over in the ideas  features and has been getting positive feed back wouldnt mind bringing this to the csm for a more critical look be nice
the mining has always been about two things that were supposed to be balanced outrisk vs rewardand since odyssey when hidden belts became nonhidden and could be accessed by anyone without the use of scan probes made the level of the risk go up rewards have stayed the samesame with all the interceptorship warp changes a dominix battleship goes alignes and warps faster than a hulk with 2x polycarbon engine housing rigs logic is where exactly risk keeps getting higher while rewards dont change or even lesseni dont even need to go into all the changes that happened to mining bargesexhumers that have raised the risk of miningthats the main problem that ccp needs to address if youve increased the risk factor how come the rewards arent really up to par
a couple of suggestions1 make static asteroid belts spawn as ice fields currently do and readd scannable belts with better ore typestiers 2 add more tiers for each type of ore with higher mineral densities3 reduce the mean ore amount in each asteroid and multiply the number of asteroids in a field the above will make mining more dynamic and with proper balancing will both thwart afkbot play and reward atk play with higher yields
i guess then we need siphon units to siphone money from marading pirates as well to balance the whole siphon story
i was chatting with someone on skype today about the tugboat concept and they saw it as a loot pinatawhich it would be in a way depending on its death mechanicsbut i suggested an addendum to aggro mechanics that any owner of a ship in the line would have return fire rights of a lmiited engagement think of a chain of industrials towed by the tug but with escort ships that had a stake in seeing the caravan gets to the destinationmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
youre trying to apply the logic of scifi stories and movies to eve online well you cantim sure everyone can find plenty of scifi material where battles between induhvidual frigateclass vessels takes seconds not minutes not hours seconds the thing that eve doesnt have is hullbreach which in rl would ussually happen if you had a crew compartment not isolated from the rest of the shipor we could go into fleet engagements in books or movies where they last way shorter than youd think so why make everything slower say i want to fly a capital do you think im prepared to wait 3 years to get into one then spend 2 more years before i can actually shoot with it
when was the last time your gun was destroyed by an ennemi reducing your dps
i believe eve is in the state that soes engineers have called the overbloated everquest codethe legacy code which would have to be completely rewritten to allow certain changes to itself be processed and no amount of adding new stuff is going to fix that
ill definitely put some thought into it and appreciate both the support and input just off the cuff i would say that attacking one could extend aggro to either the corporation of the pilot or the owners of the cargoi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
anyone else have any suggestions on aggroi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
bring jukbox back ccp your new system suks ass 
iUFFFDm stuck at work so this will be short to foster thoughstart everyone in a pod at the edge of the arena at the center place prefitted frigates and cruisers with destroyers at the edge where the pods start there could be more ships than people at each level with the exact numbers being worked out laterat the start the pods race to the center and get into a frigate their goal is to make it to a destroyer and then back into a cruiser lose a ship try to go back and get inside of one of the same or lessor size until they are goneonce you are in a cruiser you can shoot empty ships if you wantthis could a last person in a ship wins or a team format maybe even more than two teams at once
im not sure if youre suggesting slowing down just combat scenarios like forced tidi or all gameplay but if it was just just combat situations youd be screwing solosmall gangs that want to hit and run stuff by giving people outside tidi more time to react and save their getting ganked buddy or if youre suggesting all gameplay then again its a bad idea you already can give up huge periods of time for relatively small tasks as it is
how could you possibly think such a thing im pretty jealous that nullseccers can watch a movie while their fc fights their battles while we low sec scrubs have to actually manually shoot stuff
helloid like to present to the csm my idea that our official forums are far too heavily moderated by the isdsthey will lock threads for trolling just because they do not share your opinion or because you are voicing a negative feeling about an eve mechaniceg a topic like cynosural fields are op is likely to be locked for trolling simply because it expressed the idea that eve is not a perfect game and there are still things in it that should be reworked and rebalancedwhy does this matter well for interesting discussions to occur we should allow people at least some freedom in what they saythe posts on the forums will become incredibly boring and stagnant if everyone has to tiptoe around trigger happy isds locking threadsand also though its been beaten to death bring back caod ie let anyone post in caod the rules they implemented could have been a great idea they could have helped caod and made it more civil instead they killed itccp created groups like the csm to give feedback about various things in the eve universeid really appreciate it if you considered my proposal to go to the ccp community managers and ask them to try to be a bit lighter with forum moderationhi
i would like some clarification on something that seems stupid to me firstly let me clarify my point is from the perspective of low sec so if you dont care about low sec i suggest you stop reading nowi assume we can all agree theyre a large boost to anybody recieving them so even though ccp have marginally made them less safe by forcing them to be outside pos shields theyre still at very little risk despite being a major force multiplier sitting them on a station or on a gate ready to jump out and cloak is simple so why is it that when somebody does something like remote sebo an outlaw or any othere remote boost that they get suspectcriminally flagged depending on what the person recieving has shot yet somebody recieving gang links boosts and does the same crime as the previous example and the link char isnt flagged this would make a major difference to how passively they can be used considering the percentage of frigsdestroyers in the faction warfare areas that could otherwise force them to jump out or dock considering theyre commonly used in such ship type scale fights it seems only right that they should be able to drive that advantage off which currently they cant due to gatestation gun fire
more often than not boosters tend to be alts tabbed down while flying your main because ganglinks gimp your fit pretty badly so you can try to bump or alpha it trust me it works
it works aslong as the target isnt paying attention its a pretty big assumption to say more often than not people are tabbed out as loads of people have multiple monitors youre not really suggesting its working as intended due to link characters occasionally not paying attentionthis wasnt really the point either the main point was why other remote assistance flags a character as a criminaloutlaw while gang links which arguably are the biggest boost you can recieve do notthink about it from the perspective of someone in the fw areas most of the pvp in them is frigatedestroyer pvp imagine youre having a 1v1 with somebody in a t1 frig they are using links to significantly boost the ability of their ship their links are situated on a gate ready to jump out and cloak at the first sign of danger imagine somehow youve managed to get out of their extended tackle range and warped to the boosting ship this ship was being used against you for a criminal actsupporting a war target against you yet you cant engage it thanks to the protection of gate guns thats stupidthat differs from somebody using say a remote sebo alt to boost their main gatecamping which rightly becomes flagged and therefore a valid target
this will be messy so if you boost your fleet mate you go suspect imagine the impact his will have in highsec lol poor incursion runners to be frank gang links are not a targeted module which makes giving them a suspect  criminal flag upon activation problematic i think the real solution is simply to force links to be ongrid they are extremely imbalancing so forcing them on grid while very difficult on some fleet types is the optimal solution
no because theyre not aggressing other players like i said i dont see how other remote assistance modules can have different suspectoutlaw mechanics for your example somebody would have to go suspectoutlaw in order for the links to be flagged its not even like they couldnt be docked up but it would mean in low sec that small ships could drive them into the station or into another system which considering the links are working against the frigsdestroyers i dont think is unreasonable
while the above poster brings up some good reasons why this may not work i find the ops idea pretty interestingnot only would it be useful as he said if you are flying more than one account but also for fleet roams or patrols fleet leader can create a proposed route and hand it out to the fleet this way fleet members are more informed and scouts can then fly a few systems ahead while easily keeping track of where they are in relation to the fleetjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

meant to reply to this earlier got eaten by worki think a bracketing system for tournaments either or both neo and at would work well provide prizes for the victors of the lower brackets prizes which will help them compete in the brackets above them that gives nontoptier teams some money it gives players a sense of accomplishment and a taste of whats to come sounds at run was somewhat good for this our first match in particular was winnable had we more experiencei would tier tournaments by tournament performance or ship budget rather than player age one could run a team that repeatedly performs poorly gsfs team despite significant potential or a team full of relative noobs who are nonetheless the hottest up and coming tournament pilots you could run a series of tournaments made of constructed teams a la neo then use the results from that to compute the seed for the at alliances with experienced skilled tournament pilots should be put up against similar alliances alliances for which there is insufficient data should play in qualifiers perhaps on sisi or perhaps not i can see metagaming around this happening re tools one thing a former corpmate mentioned talking to you about was a tournament bubble deployable something that performs no other function than to define a radius so people can see it thatd be a neat start although graphics would be hard yellow warp disruptor
make it similar to americas cup winner gets to chose the rules for next year
op your an idiot lets be honest oh lets add a delay on locking on decloak what do you get anything small t1 or t2 frig sees you knows theres a delay eitehr 1 combat fit for pvp rushs you and in effect kill you assuming your in point rangebombing should only be done when you have a warp through so the range is meh and 2 if your out of range my nemesis has 119k range on the torps and 130k lock with my fits just warp away simplly put a bomber with a lock delay on decloak is next to worthless against anything combaty with someone paying attention and would only be useful on hualers and barges and even the barges its iffy since as pointed out before they have a flight of lights again as has been said before a solo bomber is beyond meh same with a solo bomber bombing stuff your meh i dont think a single bomb can kill anything in one hit beyond a mwding t1 frig you mentioned in fleets well guess what i could take 10 incursus warp in on something using a cloaking as a warpto and chanegs are anything short of a cap kill ityes i know uber fit bs could likely tank and all but 10 incursus can still do a lot of dmg and cost nothing in short bombers are fine the way they are
when will ppl stop calling for nerf because of goons fotm really this is getting old and painfullthis is how many ship were nerfed to the groundwhat will it be nextif your bc cannot defend himself vs a solo sb and die thats not because sb is op its because you are bad at flying said bcand for frigs lol the sb is probably the worst choice to engage frigs unless bombing them
bomber attacked my helios the other day foolish maniticorein general im pretty happy with bombers they are unique with an interesting weapon system that truly is only really viable against stationary targets or large targets their bombs are great antiblob tools but require work and coordination to accurate deploy they might be great for grinding sov structures but even a small force can harass the hell out of a siege fleet if they create the equivalent of tracking computers for missiles ie a module to lower explosion sig  velocity they might need reexamining but i dont see where they are overpowered in the current environment
in highsec you gain a suspect flag if you remote assist someone that is attack an opponent that cannot attack you legally so you are right that the incursion link alt wont go suspect unless someone attacks the incursioners and the incursioners shoot back
well thats exactly what im suggesting if they are being used to boost a players combat capability against another player they should be fair game im not sure how i feel about them being fair game for everybody in highsec but if thats how it works for things like logiremote sebo etc then it should be consistent
afk gameplay so that would means that anchoring mechanic is bad and need change to
afk cloaking threads are always entertainingbut seriously now a question for the hunterssay there was a game mechanic to force cloakies out of hiding just as an example yet another deployable that causes all cloaks in system to slowly degrade over time say after an hour or two the cloak stops working only way to avoid it is jump out of system if you do then jump back in the degradation timer resets completely logging off doesnt stop the timer when you log back in the timer continues ticking from whatever time was left when you logged outso yeah you can camp systems cloaked all you want you just have to switch systems or jump in an out every hour or twothe question is honestly guys how would this be an uninteresting new mechanicwouldnt it make things more livelyyou could still camp a system for weeks still play the psychological warfare game which i think is cool btw you just couldnt do it while youre off to work or pub crawling in rland the defenders would get a small chance to catch you once every hour or so if they prepare and pay attentionwouldnt this  or a similar mechanic  be more fun more interaction more gameplay both for the hunters and the preybtw im no nullbear im in lowsec fwpiracy theres no such thing as a safe system to me reds  neutrals are everywhere and i never engage in mining or pvebut from my outside perspective it just seems to me that the hunters resistance to any change on this matter is equal or stronger than the i admit often hilarious nullbear tears
i am going to have to answer no for myselfthis is focusing on a symptom not the primary issueplease consider the followingcloaked campers are an issue because the defenders wish to maintain a persistent presence of ships which are at best poor at pvp the primary tactic these ships use is evasion for this reasonthe campers are cloaked because ships of superior fighting ability to them can be brought in just not until they are aware of a need this problem exists partly because these ships are not a normal presencethe real issue is we are playing not simply a pvp game but one featuring space combatthe ships exist in three tiers in this regard to ability in space combaton top are dedicated pvp ships they are not good at much more than pvp so when other needs exist they have difficulty meeting them obviously they have superiority in space combatin the middle we have stealthy ships they are mediocre at pvp having compromised potential for the purpose of balancing their stealth capacity they are mediocre at space combat being less effective than the pure dedicated shipson the bottom are the dedicated isk generation vessels mining ships being an often cited examplethese are the least effective at space combat relying on avoiding conflict whenever possibleeach level is capable of preying on those below it and fighting against those on their own levelyour suggestion ignores the disparity in fighting ability and treats the symptom by simply limiting access to the middle groupif we want to see more fights aka interaction in the minds of many players we need to dispel the perception of disparity between the levels that players can make plans aroundgive the lowest level the fighting ability to confront the mid level and this resolves itselfnoone expects the dedicated pvp ships to stand a post and it would be absurd to coerce them for suchupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
im a passionate reader of all carebear vs tough guys discussionthough mostly a strong supporter of the tough guy side i believe the carebear apologists raise a few valid points namely 1 the need to give new players more ways to ease into the games difficulty and 2 the opportunity to extend the player base if it can be done without compromising the ruthless and complex gameplay we all lovemy proposal introduce limited companies natural new player progression would be npc corp limited company ltd corporation incall ingame player corps would be either one or the other with the abbreviation always shown after the corp name thus wed have corps like friendly newbies corner ltd and goonwaffe incthis is how it could workncp corps remain as they are but with a very significant increase in taxes  like up to 4050 or so also add additional high taxes to all buying and selling done by npc corp memberslimited companies ltds have lower taxes than npc corps but still high  like 2030 or so also all buying and selling will be similarly taxed i dont mean player taxes here but game taxes  isk sinks the company may also choose to tax its members to fund itself but that would be on top of the default game taxlimited companies cannot own pos nor claim sovreignty the may form alliances only with other ltdsplayers in ltds have their crimewatch safety permanently set to green no yellow or red actions allowedeverything else remains the same as current player corporationsso whats the advantage of an ltd there are two1 ltds cannot declare war or be war decd2 players in ltds cannot shoot eachother freely so no awoxingcorporations incs remain exactly the same as they are todayplayers may freely move between npc corps ltds and incs but if they drop from an inc to run from a wardec for example they get a one week cooldown before being able to join another inc yes this would also nerf serial awoxing but i think its only fair if recruiting somebody is not to be taken lightly so should joining a corpall this meansa if you are a new player or a casual player you stay in an ltd in highsec you can mine or pve all you want you can enjoy the game alone or  better  with likeminded friends without risking wardecs or awoxing sure your isk is nerfed but your player experience is not  you still get to do all the game activities you want except pirating and spacestructure ownership obviously you still can be suicide ganked or bumped or scammed  youre never 100 safe in eveb if you dont want any nerfs to your isk or possovreignity you join an inc fully accepting all the risks that come with it and hopefully not whining about it anymore  also the current pirates that hide in npc corps will probably have to take some additional risks too which im sure they dont mind at alladvantages for carebears a bit more safety from the more experiencedhigh sp players the ability to form a carefree group without having to triplecheck new recruits for aspiring ceos the opportunity to develop their soft skills group management keeping everybody engaged etc without having to also worry about more experienced players giving you a hard time they can then upgrade to leading an inc when they feel theyre ready for the upscale riskrewardadvantages for the tough guys nobody will accuse you of griefing newbies anymore and lets face it all tears are nice but true helpless newbie tears arent that tasty  better to focus on the guys that think theyre so good at this game but really are not  id expect many more players joining incs because of the isk greed so many more wardecs just think about incursion runners for example either they stop making ridiculous money or they put their shiny ships to good pvp useit would be like the often proposed nerf highsec to the ground only better imho highsec is nerfed only if you dont want to engage in pvp combat on the other hand if you are willing to risk something highsec becomes a high riskhigh reward player interaction heavenat the same time we could bring more people into the game who dont imbalance the economy because their isk is nerfed can always be ganked bumped scammed and interacted with in all ways except the current two ways that are honestly difficult for a true newbie to defend against war decs and awoxing have a strong incentive isk to gradually become less carebear and more badass eve playerif i got this right im pretty sure both tough guys and real newbies could support the idea i also suspect professional carebears meaning riskadverse experienced players 99 focussed on iskmaking will probably not as a way to make this more viable avoiding carebear riots  ccp could introduce the npc and ltd nerfs gradually like 20 taxes initially 30 after 3 months or so etc to give iskmakers time to better adapt and also have fun manipulating the economic side of things which i also consider a great form of pvp interactiontwo final words1 apologies if this has been suggested before i did do some searching but maybe missed it2 im sure i also missed a ton of possible drawbacks and loopholes if you like the general concept any ideas to tweak or improve it would be greatly appreciated
why not completely change how boosts workmake them modules that require targeting give em adequate range naturallythe targeted ship gets the boosts and also transfers the effect to all ships in the fleet command chain underneath so you need to target the fleetwingsquad commander to give everybody boosts fixes all the offgrid vs ongrid discussion yeah you have to be on grid and no gridfu doesnt matter fixes ops issue yes if you target boost a suspect you become a suspect just like rr makes flying a booster ship an active fleet role you gotta target the right person if he pops you gotta know whos next in chain of command etc all the while trying to stay out of harms way much like how logi pilots fly applies also to boosters the usual fleet tactics go for the enemy booster or not send an intie or two to tackleget warpinscare him off assign a frigate or two to protect the booster jamdamp the booster etc etc allows for some treachery suddenly your booster guy decides he likes the other fleet more and starts boosting themi admit to not havingusing boosters myself except when im in somebody elses boosted fleet but the whole trainbuy a booster alt get him in the system where youre fighting hide him away someplace and forget about it seems a supremely uninteresting game mechanic to me currently people are kinda forced to use it cuz its so powerful andor puts you at so much of a disadvantage if youre the only side without boosters but i seriously doubt anyone is having fun with itthe fact that there are plenty of booster alts but zero booster mains should be a clear enough indication of a boring mechanicedit derp i just realized that this could be easily exploited by having both booster and fleet commander offgrid  my badso ok i still support the op and furthermore im another one of the boosts should be on grid guys maybe a 150km area of effect around the boosting ship limited to fleet members would work instead
nick you fully understand what i am getting at i wish i could have explained it as good as you did herebarring a fundamental change in ships and eve itself solutions are far and few inbetween you cannot please everybody if a deployable is used i do like the idea of a slow decay or somthing along those lines however still be best ideas i have heard involve removing local chat as an intel tool and putting something in its place please keep the good ideas coming
why does anything need to be put in its place
in order to know peace and contentment a person must seek the path of least conflict with their environmentin objects dont put the square peg in the round holein eve dont expect pvp ships to stand guard when they could have more fun elsewhereupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
so you want pvp to happen in the pvp arena while you can theme park in your corner of the universe
for myself not necessarily that at alli want the pve ships capable of fighting back directly rather than subscribe to the myth of being defended by selfless players who pay to stand guard over themi want to bet my ability to defend my mining operation rather than run and hideupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
you want to plow the fields in full plate armor doesnt work that way chief
it does need to be nerfed or updated to make it eazer to cash out also another way to add more tags is to have players in fw drop rank tags it would give a reason to hunt down players
first i would like to state that i understand the importance of an impact fighter bombers have on game play however i do believe it is unfair that only the wealthy in eve have the ability to use fighter bombers while i would like to see this implementation actually happen it needs to be deployed in a controlled manner as to not greatly overpower the usefulness of this particular capital class shipproposal 1 allow carriers to deploy bombers according to their skill level in the respective carrier skillexample amarr carrier iv allows 4 fighter bombers maximum for the archon while gallente carrier v allows 5 fighter bombers for the thanatos on the same character never to exceed 5 deployed bombers for any carrier in one instanceproposal 2allow the advanced drone interface skill regulate fighter bomber use on standard carriers in one of two waysfirst allow one fighter bomber deployment from carriers per skill level of advanced drone interfacingorsecond allow one fighter bomber deployment for each capital drone control unit activated regardless of carrier or drone skill levels that would not naturally effect deployment of droneseither proposal would limit standard carriers to 5 maximum deployed fighter bombers per carrier i believe this change will allow standard carrier pilots to be more useful in pvp and allow different strategies for the fielding of capital ships for the future i would appreciate any insight others would have to amend this proposal or explain why this is a very bad idea please keep remarks clean
i think this is a very good idea and i would support it as a small corpalliance type of person where it would enable smaller entities a better chance against supers and the like i am especially thinking also about the impact on sov warfare which would shake things up a bit even with the blob blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
any reason it is not a good idea or just no actual input is required here please

please demonstrate the incentive that pvp players have to pay for an eve account so that they may stare at miners persistently cycle mining lasersnote the option to go on roams and seek pvp may be perfectly understood yet still be rejected so this dynamic can be preservedalso please note the ships most often cited as being capable of actually threatening pve assets in null are also demonstrated to be unwilling to engage in an obvious losing engagementthe pvp ships by virtue of their known presence would act as a deterrent sadly this would result in virtually ensuring that they see no pvp while filling this necessary function of guardianshipa cat sits until it is done sitting and then gets up stretches and walks awaya pvp player stays until they lose interest then looks up other opportunities to find play and warps awayit is simply in their nature and to deny this is follyupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
a carrier at max skillsfit can deploy 15 fighters 5 baseline 5 w carrier skill 5 w drone control units at 525 dps each for 7875 baseline dps the carrier is cheaper has less tank and can deploy any other drone out there other than fighterbombersa supercarrier at max skillsfit can deploy 25 fighterbombers 5 baseline 15 w carrier skill 5 w drone control units at 200 dps each for 5000 baseline dps or 635x as much dps the supercarrier is more expensive has appreciably more tank and can only deploy fighters or fighterbombersunder your proposed new mechanic a carrier fit for maximum drones could deploy a mixed squad of 5 fighterbombers in addition to 10 other drones this puts the maximum baseline dps potential at 1525 525 fighters 1000 fighterbombers reducing the dps spread to 328xi could probably calculate for the various skills and bonuses boosting drone dps but thats what eft evehq etc are forthis would increase the appeal of the alreadyversatile carrier i do wonder about how it would unbalance the existing capital ship hierarchy i dont see neardoubling of carrier damage potential being good news for the crazyexpensive and decidedly unversatile dreadnought it would point towards a new avenue for carriers in pvp besides triage and carrying infinite sentry drones for spidertanking efforts given the immense differences in tank between a carrier and a supercarrier it would be sort of like the tier 3 battlecruiservsbattleship tradeoffs or the new destroyersvscruisers a lot more damage potential but still cant fully punch above your weight class oneonone poss already easy targets for capital blobs will be that much more vulnerable with carriers able to hit harder than normal at less cost than dreadnoughts and with longer legs
i appreciate your input null and with the implemention perhaps the best way to manage it is with active drone control units meaning you must sacrifice high slots to fit 5 bombers totalleaving options for remote reppers and energy transfers to zero as carriers only have 5 high slots so to reasonably equip a carrier for xfer you would only be capable of launching 3 bombers to save space for 1 energy xfer and 1 shieldarmor remote repperperhaps those numbers are a bit more reasonable or equip some carriers full bombers and others full triage capable so while a fleet of carriers is potent as it should be this tactic could be added as fleets wouldnt know which carrier to primary
personally while the idea is noble i think it isnt the best idea out theredreadnaughts are the capital killers and damage dealers for the average pilot when you look at most killmails after the supers and titans the dreadnaughts make the rest of the damage with the carriers at the bottomcarriers really are more of a logistic ship than a damage dealer while their fighters can do very good damage most of the carriers bonuses are to repping and cap transferring depending on the racewhile dreadnaughts are more expensive they still arent completely out of reach
numbers from eft not sure how accurate it ismax skills thanatos with 15 fighters  1875 dps cant attack posmax skills thanatos with 15 sentries  675 dps can attack posmax skills thanatos with 10 fighters and 5 bombers  3250 dpsmax skills nyx with 25 bombers  12500 dpsmax skills moros with 3 ion siege blaster i loaded with antimatter and siege module i  5711 dpsthese numbers are on skills alone set to 5 no extra weapon upgrades or drone upgrades aside from drone control units if these are any reflection of true ingame numbers the carrier group will still be well below dreads and far below super carriersthis change would allow carrier pilots to be a fighting force for their alliances who can jump farther than any class capital and be a true asset for quick and effective strikes while being able to use other drone assets to defend against sub capital fleets adjusting the need for high slots to deploy bombers would limit the carriers ability to be used for logistics which would be the balance effect to require a pilot to give up something for added versatility
firstly supers arent even particularly expensive anymore secondly carriers already have a huge role in combat well multiple roles actually so why would they possibly need buffing further thirdly your numbers in the above post are completley meaningless why would anybody use a no damage mod moros for example fourth why would anybody use supers if carriers could do the same job at a fraction of the price fifth youve just killed any point in using dreads too well except maybe structure bashing carriers wouldnt be stuck in siege for 5 mins with all resulting vulnerabilities and doing comparable damagethe only thing i really agree with in this post is the suggestion that fighters need some love im not sure what but they need a boost of some kind perhaps fighters get damage increases from use of ddas but definately wouldnt include fighter bombers
just some quick questions to opwho do you think these isds are that seem to have offended you so muchare they independent entities with no connection to the gameare they alts of ccp devsor are they volunteers from the player base who give up their time to make sure that the forums maintain a reasonable level of civility and respect for othersi would say they are the last you know players with a stake in the game and who wish to give something backyes there are times that the moderation seems to be a bit heavyhanded but in my opinion the ccl for they are the moderators do a good job and i hate to think what the forums would be like without their unpaid effortsand no before you ask i am not a ccl volunteer just someone who has had reason to be grateful for the mods on these forums in the past

hi
this concept is awesome and perhaps an empire warfare would be necessary every few years started by ccp like incursions where one faction actively battles another in high sec space and shift the ownership this way ot that even into player controlled hands this scenerio could benefit game play and perhaps see caps allowed back into empire for a set duration controlled by ccp of course perserve parts how they are for new players and those who choose a neutral stance on the story line of what is happening this idea could spawn into many different things but is worth pursuing perhaps i would like to see the gallente empire pushed into making some 00 regions empire while losing ground where they sit or changing current 1 thru 4 systems into 5 and vica versapush this to the top could be amazing
i think you should at least be allowed one name change if you buy a character from the character bazaar
agreed i miss it alot in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move  d adams
well a boosted moros can reach almost 13kdps with mods which helps prove my point that unboosted it still ranks above carriers with up to 5 bombers but thats tech 2 siege faction ammo and 3 mag field stabs ii and 2 rigs lvl 5 skills ofc so its not actually comparable damageperhaps it is the fighters who need love for the carriers sake3250 dps max on a thanatos who receives bonuses unlike other carriers isnt in the realm of overpowered when you are sacrificing your ability to remote rep or xfer energy the only increased threat here are stations other caps and finally we can hit a pos respectfullybtw what is your range of not particularly expensiveappreciate the reasoning elextrix its pretty sound
the only way id be alright with carriers having fighter bombers is ifwhen they sieged allow them to fit a siege module that gives them the ability to deploy fighter bombers and perhaps it would be alright the truth is i dont believe this would be a good idea even if they had to siege for such an ability simply put theyd be competing with dreads but with less damage and less damage range i just dont see a reason to give carriers more attack potency
by not particularly expensive  im not saying theyre cheap of course but wealth per capita has never been higher isk grinding is easier than its ever been and it really wouldnt take that long to replace if you know what youre doing with isk making if youre in a corp that supports helping members into supers it should be even easierthe problem wouldnt be that dreads dont do more damage still of course they would the problem would be that a carrier could do a decent chunk of that damage without dread like vulnerabilities which is a really big deal once youve sieged green theres no aligning out no rr and at the mercy of anything that might jump in during that 5 minute cycle a carrier with your proposal could jump in out of the range of a sieged dread if it wished align out recieve reps from buddies refit on friendly carriers which inevitibly jumped in with you and warp out should the fc decide at the presence of a hostile cyno it would also still have the ability to hit sub caps hard on its own too which a dread cannot i dont know if youve been playing long enough to remember when supers could use all drones it suckedfor what its worth i would support an increase in fighter damage not as high as 3250dps or with the existing ability to assign fighters but somewhere around the 2k mark for about 10 seems ok to me currently they are terrible
so what you undock  bubble  dock up the second later one try to warp out and gain a timercool but you are already in station yet you agressed someone in a time frame that wouldnt allow you to dockwhat to do we eject you from station thenlaunch bubble  gun timer there fixed it
a couple other tings to ponder if you shoot an npc with your guns or use ewar on them you do not gain a weapons timer so why should dropping a bubble instantly give you a weapons timer if you insist that dropping a bubble gives you a weapons timer then then everyone inside the bubble should instantly gain a pvp timer my suggestion gives a weapons timer to the dictor at the same time that the victim receives a pvp timer ie when he tries to warp in the bubble and is prevented because of it furthermore my suggestion solves the bubble camping shenanigans if they drop a bubble and you warp in it and are subsequently prevented from warping because of the bubble the dictor gains a weapons timer if they are docked so what your problem is still solved because if they undock they will still have the weapons timer assuming you are still attempting to warp in their bubble and then they will be pragmatically stuck on the station undock inside their own bubble and unable to dock if you cant figure out how to solve that situation you shouldnt be in nullsec to begin with
1bubble aggression mechanics are ridiculous
this would enable gazillions of riskaverse carebears to join wardecimmune corps rat mission mine manufacture and trade to their hearts content thus affecting the rest of the game and only have to worry about being ganked or awoxed yeah gonna say this is a terrible idea
the concepts not bad i reckon ops suggesting creating an actual meaningful downside to being in npc or limited corp and a limited corpd just be a chatroom and a logo which i have no problem with but the safety shouldnt be stuck on green the safety is the idiotproof switch you dont need to idiotproof it againother problems are that mined ore should be taxed somehow and 4050 is way too high a taxe oh except the problem that market taxes are bypassed by alts in full corps but we i like the concept if not the execution
you havent met many carebears have you benny
problems with this proposal 1 safety switch set permanently to green so by joining an ltd characters are unable to commit a suspect or criminal action frankly there is no good reason to discourage players from doing these actions 2 cannot be wardecced players in highsec may mine manufacture mission and haul items around i believe that their operations should absolutely be hinderable by player actions suicide ganking wardecs etc you need some real drawbacks if youre going to have more wardec immune corps frankly we first need taxes to be set for refining sales bounties lps and si lines for all corps then simply set npc corp taxes to 1020 and let player corps set their own taxes after that we dont need ltds 3 nothing deployed in space if you cant wardec the corp they shouldnt be able to deploy any objects in space for corp pos are the obvious but no pocos no anchorable cans or bubbles etc they can launch items for individuals but not for ohters 4 why at the end of the day i dont see the need for this halfstep have people gimped in npc corps and let them take the step into player corps as they desire it isnt hard to do a background check on an applicant and it isnt unreasonable to expect corps to do such a thing i see no reason to create these riskfree institutions

if you dont have a hustle and youre not spacerich dont blame the isk blame yourself
i dont have the time or patience to explain in detail why giving carriers in their current state the ability to deploy fighterbombers is a horrendously bad idea so cliff notes there is a reason we dont allow supers to deploy drones other than fighters and fighterbombers a very good reason there is a reason we dont let dreads use drones anymore a very good reason there is a reason why carriers have their specified intended role in the capital tree a very good reason capital proliferation is bad enough asis giving highsp alliancescorporations easier access to fighterbombers regardless of place in the nullsec cartels or lowsecfacwarfare groups is a recipe for disaster and lessfun carriers already fill a plethora of roles some of them questionably not where the ideal carrier should be giving them the additional dps role that should really belong to dreads supercarriers and maybe titans is a recipe for disaster fighters have been metaouted for a while now due to their inability to be used against subcaps to much of a degree of usefulness or for most of my alliance against the redcross menace at an acceptable iskhr ratio they really need to be rebalanced to be useful for defending capital groups from bcbs gangs instead of reliance on sentry drones adi is a skill that needs redesigning anyway this is not the redesign it needs i really dont want lowersp characters getting access to fighterbombers just because they own a carrier there is a degree of epeening that comes from achieving the ability to field a supercarrier and being given access to fighterbombes on that ship may as well be an exclusive perk of the craft plus i hate people whining about instant gratification of their goals when they realize that eve actually takes some time and investment to get to where you ideally want to be as previously mentioned getting a supercap isnt that hard these days if you find it really hard to do youre really doing something wrong
thanks to all for your feedbackfirst id like to further clarify my main objective which is to make highsec a more dangerous place with more player conflictthe whole ltd idea is to address what in my opinion is the only reasonable objection to this plan that it would be a bit too difficult for the new playersalmost all arguments for the opposite ie make highsec safer fall into just two categories1 people should have the right to carebear in peace if they so wish2 the game is still too hard for newbiessadly i often hear and read argument 2 which is reasonable used as an excuse to support argument 1 which imho is bullshit and would destroy what makes eve such an outstanding gameso i tried to come up with a reasonable solution to argument 2 limited companies good for newbros bad i hope for veteran carebears because of the severe nerf to isknow ill try to address the points you all made
yes you may be right and that would be a terrible outcomebut how many carebears do you know that would be willing to give up 30 or more of their income carebearing is all about isk again just think of incursion runners for a momentalso they are already doing that by staying in npc corps or evading wardecs with no significant downside in my scenario the downside for hiding would be a severe hit to isk
safety being green was an idea to make ltds unusuable by carebeary pirates it wasnt meant as idiotproofingno need to tax mined ore if you heavily tax the sale of the ore and 50 is reasonable for the protection you get just think of civilian modules theyre starter gear theyre functional and yes theyre terrible compared to the real stuff so are ltds they work ok to start out but should be a terrible option for experienced playersand yes youre right some further mechanic would be needed to not bypass the taxes for example disabling direct trade and heavily taxing contracts unless theyre intraltd
1 see my reply to benny ltds should be unusable by piratesgankers2 see my reply to benny taxing all forms of asset sale or transfer should do the trick and its more simple got millions of lps good luck selling the lp store items but if there still are loopholes then yes tax everything thats my point too3 100 agree pos was an example yes surely also pocos and all4 personally i would agree with you but many people seem to be opposed to nerfing npc corps hell even among current csm some are discussing removing nonconsensual wardecs for example youre all for a more dangerous highsec i am too many are not the ltd idea is an attempt to find a common ground
1 i understand why you want to prevent suicide gankers from hiding in your nonwardeccable institutes however setting up a institutes that prevent players from engaging in ship to ship combat outside of extreme circumstances is simply not acceptable we want players to attempt ship pvp from time to time and your new entity almost forbids it no way 2 expanding the streams taxable by a corp offers more interesting corp management possibilities and taxing npc corps 1020 on their income streams is generally enough to get players into player corps those that dont want to deal with wardecs or potential awoxing can pay the npc corp tax and deal with it i really dont see the need for your ltds 4 to be frank im not certain we need to increase the bounty tax on nonwardeccable corps more we simply need to add similar taxes to all revenue streams and deny them the ability to use any anchorable object that cannot be immediately legally attacked to be frank wardecs are easily avoidable so creating nonwardeccable corps doesnt accomplish much other than create bonafide safe havens beyond npc corps why your proposal does nothing to make a vulnerable highsec population look at it this way why do people stay in their corps when they are wardecced dropping corp takes no time hell disbanding a corp and reforming it is trivial so why do people stay in a corp and actually fight the answer is generally to defend assets in space as such to have a more violent highsec we need players to put more vulnerable assets in space there needs to be concrete benefits to putting these vulnerable assets in space and any changes to the game should encourage players to utilize these assets look at t2 production to actually participate in this level of production you need access to copy slots the limited number of copy slots available in highsec has resulted in 3060 day queues on every line this results in any serious highsec producer to operate a pos these are nice vulnerable assets often with half a billion in potential loot for anyone coming along wanting to attack it this is a good thing look at manufacturing there are more manufacturing lines in the forge region than in all the nullsec stations combined the point unlike copy and me research lines mfg lines are abundantly available in highsec furthermore utilizing these lines costs 333 isk  hr a pos uses 10 20 or 40 fuel blocks an hour for a small medium or large pos with an operating expense of roughly 150000  600000 isk  hr you would need to run between 5002000 lines on the pos in order to justify using the pos just for mfg a pos will never have that many lines not to mention having lines at the pos is extraordinarily dangerous with me pe copying and invention activities the potentially valuable bpos you utilize are almost always safely stored in a corporate office in system which is an additional cost with mfg jobs you have to put the build materials in the pos which makes them vulnerable to attack essentially while in highsec you can use a pos to manufacture there is rarely a good reason to this is a bad thing look at refining in nullsec it is very difficult to get perfect refine even with excellent skills and implants in highsec it is trivially easy and while you can refine with a pos the process is not instantaneous nor low waste making it incomparable to highsec station refining the solution to making highsec more dangerous is not to create more safe havens but to simply encourage people to take risks have them want to utilize structures that increase their bottom line while being vulnerable to attack via wardec and require some level of defense things that should be done for miners reduce station refining turn station refining into a linejob and reduce refining to 90 yield when not refining in a poslike structure increase pos refining arrays to have the best yield hidden belts create a pos asteroid scanning array access it and it creates an expedition entry in system ideally for you to warp to and mine some newly spawned asteroids for manufacturers increase mfg pe me and copying line costs from 333 iskhr to 33300 isk  hr then manufacturing in a pos is cheaper than manufacturing in a station yes this means youll have to pay 50k isk more for that 200mm autocannon ii or an extra million on your t2 cruisers industrialists will simply pass on the cost to all end users but it makes using a pos make more sense for haulers create dynamic concord timers a mechanic that potentially increases the concord response time when in a corp for traders initiate a corporate tax on sell orders with the npc tax rate of 1020 for missioners an inspace agent allowing them to move away from mission hubs now all highsec players will benefit from being in a player corp structures give them a reason to defend themselves from an aggressive wardec they can still dodge wars if they desire or they can utilize mercenaries and allies to defend themselves the result is more content more conflict and a better game your ltds which preventing players from utilizing these tools results in less reasons for players to fight do you not see why limiting utilization of these items as terrible for the game

well i love the idea but with being scripted and removing everything after is there a reason it needs to be the character you just made is there no reason it could be a small demostand alone teaser where you just fly a lore non capsuleer pilot that suggestively dies at the end or fades to black mid fight with the current expansion slogan remember how homewolrds demo hooked you if not go to youtube im not saying it needs to be big but a small downloaddemo that is designed entirely around the experience while staying mostly true to eve and people are more likely to try something they dont have to sign up for 1st the biggest hook line is not allowing someone to finish something zeigarnik effect is a theory that says the brain is better at remembering unfinished tasks why do you think people keep coming back to mmos or that model you never finished basically by escalating the teaser fight like a dreadcap fleet hot drop and the overview going mad with reds then the fade to black something that shows you scale but leaving a cliff hangar and using lore makes it easier on resources its used very well in stories  eg bad guy got away finishing the fight in halo 2s ending but yes to anything that gets more new people in eve and trains them to want to stick aroundsupport the updating of rookie ships join the discussion
it is now 6 months since odyssey introduced 2 graphical effect that a sensible part of the player base would have the option to deactivatenamely the jump animation and the system auto scan when entering spacethe proposed changes are the following1 jump animation make it optionnal via onoff default on toggle like drone models effects etcthe reason is that it make some people sick having nausea  headaches etc2 the autoscan when entering system should be working according to its setting when its on off position no scan at allit is not logical than a feature on off position still turns on by itself with no player controlwhen one does anything else than running anoms  signatures there is absolutely no use to have this sweepingtravelling 10 jumps and seeing this useless animation every jump is annoying chasing a ship for combat purpose is painfull when you have this animationmany players already deactivated account  stopped playing just because of those two things and there is a 88 page thread asking for those two thingsi hereby ask that the csm express a clear position on those two points as well as bring at least the 1 issue to ccp since it does impact some player physiology in the best delaybrseth
are you guys really arguing siege fleet as a reason sbs are overpowered look just because you dumbasses only undock in carriers these days doesnt mean the sb is brokeni remember another alliance we fought in the last year that tried a siege fleet concept right back at us and we shut it down handily with a few rapiers vagabonds and sabres a small gang of dedicated harassers can really ruin a siege fleets day hell solo dudes in cynabals were giving our guys hell till i made the suggestion of sneaking recons into the fleet stop suckingas far as initial tackle of a bomber being op its like you guys dont even know about interceptors and warp speed rigs a ship thats only tank can be blown away by a stiff fart does not make great initial tackle unless you are dealing with complete morons
these are actually all great ideasi do hope someone in csm will present them to ccponly thing im not convinced is the dynamic concord mechanic i read your post i like the npc corp nerf but not sure about the corp sec status mechanic how about making it even more nasty if you want a faster concord you pay for itstill a corp decision you get say 34 levels of protection like ship insurance basic is free others cost more up to say 50100 mil per player per week yeah i know thats high but many people can afford that so it would be a kind of status symbolabout my ltd idea yeah maybe you guys are right but i still think inexperienced dudes could use some kind of starter mode group mechanic even if in the end its just a reserved chat channel and a common name of sorts while still technically being treated as in an npc corp
npc corps are by their very nature limited corps you cannot awox without punishment and you cannot own sov so this is really not needed and goes against player driven contentdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

question you write so youre a voice that would not normally be heard from a small bloc asking for ccp to prioritize proportional to what people enjoy doing the statements a bit vague for instance are you saying that ccp should prioritize nrds and similar gameplay in proportion to the percentage of eve players who enjoy it because that percentage is not very large would you be focusing on high sec and nbsi null sec gameplay since those are what most eve players seem to enjoy if you didnt mean that what did you meani ask because i like the idea that theres more than one way to do sov it adds texture to the game and it seems from my perch that it could make actual selfsustaining economies more possible without blueing up the whole part of space so if i were a provident i would want you to argue your case not for what it currently is but for what it could potentially bring to the game

agreed lets give us more realistic fitting options more options for using our lp as well as encouraging the lp isk sink i would love to see faction modules used more without ridiculous pricing
the original bpo holders of t2 weapon systems will see their profits drop to only healthy levels
i completely concur that faction modules could use a serious rebalancing pass at the moment they generally come across with somewhat jumbled attributes sometimes being better then t2 sometimes worse sometimes just different i think asking ccp to spend some time rebalancing them from their attributes to their build costs would be generally a good thing i dont know where i prioritize it but it is an area of game play that needs tweaking to be honest this is not a small project and shouldnt be treated in such a manner

still no answer from any csm either kinda wondering if they actually serve any purpose
the biggest issue i have at this point is being able to hit a pos effectively waits for the get more friends your space poor blah blah blahi think the carrier should have a fighter  fighterbomber bay and a drone bay i think that the number of sentries that a carrier can carry is stupid fighters need improvement that is for certainin terms of the comment about some sort of siege module for carriers when using fighter bombers why they are easy to get a point on anyway anything can point them unlike supers and titans if you make it certain death like a dreadnought then no one will do it i dont use a dreadnought simply because its just too damn vulnerable for smaller entities i am not playing this game to feed easy kills by the way if its certain death i dont do it which is why i dont use a dreadfighter bombers are good at attacking certain sov modules ihubs sbus and tcus also good on stations they should also be good on certain pos modules which have big tanks such as warp disruptor batteries ecm batteries to name a couple smaller entities would have more chances if they had fighterbombers in carriers imo also this would reduce the importance of supers death to all supers and all thatin terms of supers the reason why the drones were removed was that the drones made them too difficult to hold down they could clear off the interdictors and heavy interdictors easily on their own now they cant and are very vulnerable and need a support fleet a carrier can be pointed by anything so having drones makes no difference to them while for a super it made them virtually immune that is why you did not want to explain itdrones on dreads made little difference before the moros could have cleaned some small tackle big dealmaking carriers more useful in terms of sov bashing is a win win situation for small entities and will produce more fights in the game bigger entities will take more risks with a carrier fleet and have a reason to use them still after the drone nerf is applied when it comes everybody moans at the amount of dps needed for sov givving another option to apply dps on sov modules is a good thinga carrier applies logistics and fighters and has a tank and cap to be able to survive to a degree that is its roles it carries fighters as its main weapon why not a lower number of fighterbombersi find the comment about allowing lower skilled people getting fighter bombers on a carrier laughable all you have to do is train fighters to 5 what the hell is the difference i can jump into a super with carrier i and the advantage of supers is the large number of fighters and fighterbombers and the immunity to all but interdictors and heavy interdictors let alone the remote ecm burstno wonder you just said no with no elaborationas for getting a super sorry but i dont want another account so i can baby sit a super blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
in its current state supers are already quite useless except in certain situations they also require a dedicated character and are  expensive if you give fb to carriers it will just make them completly useless so nononononono

now admittedly my area of experience is mostly lowsec which i understand has slightly different mechanics but as soon as you land on grid in the carrier what prevents you aligning off and warping off if anything decloaks so no carriers are not easy to put a point on the siege like damage in a hard to catch ship is one of the best attributes of supers and should definately not be applied to cheaper ships and particularly ones which already have a huge rolethey were removed because they were an iwin button that didnt require subcapital support something that isnt supported by ccpjust because you have the prerequisites to fly a ship doesnt mean that you should fly a ship the difference is low skillers arent likely to jump in a super because of the cost of a loss whereas carriers are cheap for smaller and less cap heavy entities things like align out speed are a big deal so skills like capital ships 5 become more important in a superenjoy not using fighter bombers then
nothing prevents you apart from a skillful bump from warping off once you are aligned that is the whole idea of it i have bashed a few things on grid with a carrier such as pocos but the low damage i can apply means that poss are not really a good idea because i do not have immunity to the pos disruptors so in answer to you its no different to supers in terms of sov modules except that everything can point you but different in terms of poss as you need to take the point modules down fast and with fighters it is not fast also note that you cannot assign fighter bombers like you can fighters so you have to be on grid and supers being immune to all but hics and dictors have it easier do you understand it now when you say role the issue arrived because ccp added drone damage modules to the game to me a carrier applies fighters and has logistics and tank the drone issue needs to be resolved and my preferred way is a separate drone bay and fighter bay the fighter bombers sits well with their original role not the sentry drone role which developed from those modulesnote that i never carrier ratted with sentry drones the reason was that they were just too vulnerable for me i continued to use fighters and aligned out as soon as i could this made me very difficult to catch compared to all those around me that switched to sentries isk per hour stupidity wins eve lolthe fact was that the iwin was down to them being able to switch to drones clear tackle themselves and get out which is why the drone bays were removed because they were limited to only being tackled by hics and dictors made it easy for them in that respect as the carrier can be tackled by anything their vulnerability is much greater in fact with the change to an actual drone bay i would add a limited drone bay back to supers prepares asbestos suit for incoming flamesi was replying to an earlier post but i never said it was wise to do so and agree with your comment here but isnt that a good reason for have a low number of fighter bombers if you fly a super you should have cap ship 5 the racial carrier 5 and be packing the right implants the super has other advantages such as remote ecm burst immunity to all but hics and dictors and the ability to apply a large amount of fighters and fighter bombers unless ccp sees sense death to supers and all that this would be a good way to open up the game a bit more in terms of the sov modules ehp and enable smaller entities a chance to kill things without making it easy for the blobs with this change i believe that there will be a lot more pressure on those empty sov systems lets take a group that uses a character with a cloaked carrier or two they get control of the area then drop sbus and once online they use their already in place carriers that were used as mobile bases along with mobile depots with their fighterbombers now at last we have truly effective small group impacts on sov maybe it will pan out that way maybe not carriers are cheap and effective i have 3 on this toon aloneccp have started to look at making 00 more fluid this suggestion would be a great leveler but i seriously doubt ccp has it in them to do this so your little crack here may be the reality which is why that when a certain game is up and running in 2015 i am likely to be running around on that instead blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
this issue needs to be addressed i hear a lot of people in eve foam at the mouth quite rightly at pay to win however i also find amusing that the biggest example of play to win is this those that can afford multiple accounts have it easier my view is that you can only play eve effectively with two accounts in the past i used to play play by mail games and there was a game called tribes of crane in that game i was paying for 6 tribes and 2 political characters which gave me a significant individual power some people accused me of paying to win though of course they could control npc tribes and political characters as part of their faction the only difference i had was that my player controlled tribes and pfs were far better than the npc ones this gets into the issue of game balanceat this point we have these mega alliances with vast isk reserves that can plex up massive super carrier fleets when they want how the hell can smaller entities deal with that also the production of these things is controlled as part of sov in terms of game balance to give a chance of competing this fighterbomber suggestion has meritand if any of you think that 5 fighterbombers per player in a carrier that can be pointed by any ship is the same as a super that can run 20 of them has a remote ecm burst has immunity to all but hics and dics then i have to question the quality of your grey matter its as stark as that blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
supers at about 7 times the cost of a dread and 10 times the cost of a carrier have it easier how unreasonableyoure really not making much sense you seem to want to avoid any risks and have the benefits of supers without the penalties such as cost and the need for another account its your problem if your pos bash is going slowly because of your fear of using dreads or unwillingness to invest in supers riskreward working exactly as it should in my opinion when i say multiple roles i mean carriers can do triage pantheon ratting hauling all sorts there is absolutely no reason to give them any more roles such as siege proportionate damage again youre not making much sense drone problem drone assist is sort of being fixed and you solution has nothing to do with that so i assume you mean some other problem not entirely sure why youre smugging about being hard to catch either its swings and rounadabouts again fighters suck and youre no doubt making less money as a result by not using sentries low risk strategy deserves low level reward so thats a good thing in my book yes but costs considerably more than a carrier it cant dock has a massive bullseye on its back requires a second account for the holder cant be insured cant be built without access to sov its very much deserving of its unique abilitieswhat do you mean it wouldnt make things easier for the blob too all they would do is hit the same structures with carrier gangs too they wouldnt bother with supers as why risk them when the carriers can do the job just as well i share your desire for 00 to be more broken up and for smaller entities to have a fighting chance without a blues list longer than than this post but what youre proposing is just bad and im not sure why youre so terrified of any kind of risk if everybody was so risk averse then this would be the dullest game ever i have multiple capitals too and guess what they get put in harms way
i really need to stop responding to you were clearly not going to agree this issue is where ccp is making a ton of their money anybody who thinks there isnt a certain amount of pay 2 win in eve is naive or stupid of course they want players with as many accounts as they can possibly encourage because its more subscriptions to them supers arent the only example scout alts hauling alts falcon alts link alts farming alts cyno alts the list is endless all of them have substantial benefits to the player over those withouti dont really know what to say about the isk issue if your running anomalies with fighter carriers then i suppose its not that surprising youre having difficulty making the dough to get a superand you have obviously completley missed the point if you think im saying supers and hypothetical carriers with 5 bombers are the same thing the can be pointed by any ship argument is so weak as well youve already said your massively against risk anyone who roams knows what players like you are like safe up at the first neutral in local pretty hard to get tackled when your half way to the pos by the time the neutral has even dscanned your general direction down we all know what would happen  bash pos mods when local is clear you cyno in your gang of carriers drop fbs align out and get out the second any possible threat is anywhere near i mean you said yourself thats how you do anomalies meaning your as safe as any super so leave out the bs how a super is so much safer
ccp have said that they do not want ability linked directly to cost in any case supers would have four times the tank four times the damage in terms of fighterbombers in terms of this suggestion and they have the advantages of immunity to all but hics and dics and can use remote ecm burst they will be no where near as good as supers the damage would be 2000 dps which is double their current against sov modules hardly game breaking is ita dread gets a 10k dps in siege the fighter bombers from carriers as suggested would be 20 of that but it gives optionsyou talk about risk and reward so your comments on the cfc using sbs in fountain that was low risk wasnt it so i am some sort of bad player for wanting lower dps for lower risk but something better than what is possible now yeah righta carrier is a ship designed to apply fighters with logistic ability and a good tank that it has other roles within the game is how people use them now i have pointed out that a super had 8k of damage a sieged dread 10k and a carrier with 5 fighter bombers would be 2k people do use carriers against poss and structures but currently the damage is 1kthe reduction in the number of assigned drones is a band aid fix in reality they need to have separate fighter and drone bays so that the drones carried are more limited do you get that there was a goon a week back who lost two carriers sentry ratting within a day of each other i can assure you that i have made a lot more isk then him and my killboard looks so much better i play my game to be hard to kill it annoys the hell out of certain players but its where i get my kicksi was talking making it harder for the blob its really a question of numbers and vulnerability to being caught  if you are caught you die simple as and people will still risk supers ast they will be four times better in other words 1 can do the job of 4 carriers and are at less risk due to their advantages which i keep repeatingi think its more options and as for being terrified rofl i dont like giving easy kills and sitting there in a dread for 5 minutes is is an easy kill sorry not for me and yes i have had my stuff in harms way i just dont do stupid things and yes most people are risk adverse that is why i almost left recently most of the players i see in my area are waiting to cyno stuff on you that is their gameplay you cannot get more risk adverse than thatanyway i think for a person who supposedly wants more small entities in 00 you miss the point that small changes can make this happen i think this would make a slight difference to be honest but a step in the right direction blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
i have several accounts just cannot be bothered to get yet another to baby sit a super and you are confusing me with the op i could buy a super if i wanted to and i dont run anomalies with fighters at the moment i dont need tothe being pointed by only hics and dics is an advantage that the supers have as compared to a carrier people had said that they would not have a reason to sit in a super well at 4 times the ability and immunity to most ships and ewar plus remote burst ecm to me is still a massive reason to sit in one i called them out on that rubbish throw away line no reason to be in a super as being the pap that it wasoh yeah i am going to sit there and let people kill me wtf this is why i developed a healthy contempt for a lot of eve players so i am some sort of bad player for not letting you kill me cry some more please and the reason supers are safer is as i stated earlier of course that is how i will do poss but you do realise that until the warp batteries are down we could have 1 or 2 carriers stuck on the pos and you talk about the risk being the same as supers wowthanks for the replies i rather enjoyed it as it enabled me to really ram home the small improvement that this would offer in terms of dps blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
lol im not saying anybody is bad for not dying im saying what the real game application of fighter bombers in carriers would be and you know im right the only reason you dont want to use dreads is because youre clearly extremely risk averse and think you should be entitled to some low risk high reward solution to your structure bashing problem ive got news for you sieging dreads isnt insta death like you seem to think either 5 minute cycles do not give people long to respond and you can be in and out before somebody has noticed you and formed a response fleet let alone positioned cynos and jumped in amusingly considering your poor argument on how much safer supers are they would likely be noticed much sooner as a bunch of peoples addressbooks would alert them to its online presencekeep posting that only hics and dics can point supers isnt making its relevance any more important if both it and a carrier are aligned out and theyre both going to bug out once a neutralhostile enters local or neighbouring systems its irrelevant which without doubt is how you see them being usedi really dont understand how you cant see that by increasing the capitalstructure bashing role of the carrier that youre diminishing the role of dreads and supers that would be game damaging if carriers were close enough in ability that you remove the reason to use them why risk a nyx when you can use 4 insured archons or use a few carriers instead of a dread with dreads it wouldnt even necessarily have to be a direct comparison in dps because of their siege cycle if they need to be there 6 mins theyre there for 10 so a few carriers that could do it in 8 would actually be more efficient dps all of course without risking your ship if you want high dps at minimal risk get your checkbook out or accept that the cheaper version is more vulnerable youre paying for what youre getting if you dont like it im not going to feel sorry for risk averse carebears complaining how long its taking to bash a posthe idea that more expensive stuff is better at a job is a concept applied the whole way through the game the more youre willing to pay the better toys you get access to next itll be oh i want blops to be able to bridge my noctis to low sec i cant afford a titan but itll be good for the game if more ships can go through a black ops bridge its only a small increase to their existing role titans will be just as useful thoughim not sure where youve got this idea im totally against the idea of reducing the drone bay on a carrier fromanyway as much as ive enjoyed correcting your misconceptions i am quite tired of discussing this obviously bad ideadiscussing pvp content with carebears

simple if you drop a bubble and there is no player inside you affect nobody so there is no reason for timerif you drop a bubble with someone inside you actually point that person using a different mechanics than a tgt point but with the same result   timer should apply technically you affect one of its ship parameter denying him the ability to warp this is clearly an aggression regarding game mechanic

they should give additional attribute bonus to faction mods if they go on the corresponding faction ship like a 5 bonus that would make those faction guns more usable and other seemingly useless faction mods
what you seem to be missing is that carrier were never meant to be structure bashers thats what dreads are for its not the dreadnoughts fault that you insist on attacking a pos that doesnt have optimal conditions for their deployment and its certainly not a reason to introduce a change that gives carriers a role they were never designed to perform
while not in your proposal i would happily support new carrier hulls that could allow the use of bombers and a hybrid weapon system such as bombers  turrets at the expense of not being able to use remote capital reppers like the existing logiorientated carriers we have
carrier as in carrying something carrying fighters and why not fighterbombers they were never meant to attack structures you say but they do on the weekend a dd fleet of chimeras attacking a pos was destroyed likely they were dimwits using sentry drones but they were attacking structures with the highest dps they could the pos example i have given is what any smaller group in 00 has to deal with and is one of the reasons for such a stale game in terms of new alliances in 00 i dont think this suggestion on its own is going to change things but with others changes it couldlets come up with a ridiculous response to your ridiculous one men were not meant to be in space in reality we are talking about game balance supers and titans were never meant to be in the numbers that they now are can we keep doing this never meant indeed but the reality is that supers and titans are now in massive numbers hence the need for something to balance off against them your idea of balance is different to mine but please get away from never meant its a stupid argument when the issue is balance and options when the reality is that we are dealing with never meant numbers of supers and titans blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
dreads apply massive dps to targets they are the goto structure bashing ship with one major drawback they cant move fore 5 minutes when applying that dps if you want structure bashing carriers i insist that they have a similar massive drawback make them siege to deploy fighter bombers
make supers siege then but the carrier with 5 fighterbombers is 20 of a sieged dread which is double their current fighter dps blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
if one checks the mark my orders radio button through in the settings of the market window your buysell orders will be marked blue which is great for locating where your order among the competition othersa suggestion for visual enhancement fto help those of us who watch and track the market to ease the pain of the day trader who sorts through heaps of orders using  view market details to see if you still have the top buysell order please suggest to ccp to color code the orders buyingselling in the my orders tab of the market view make the colors reactive to the market ie order highlighted in green signifies that you have the top order and highlighted red means you have been out bidjust an idea
read until the military pi part just because of that the rest is great but the military part is excellent supported and 10000
ok as much as i have tried i have decided that i am not explaining my position or those of the people i have been discussing this issue with properlythere has been a recent article on en24 that i believe nails iti agree with most items in this article
based on the presumption that cloaking is balanced albeit severely dysfunctional in both usefulness  weakness aspectsi would say the concept of change needs to embrace two aspects and i would suggest a methodaspect one cloaking must remain a valid play choice this said with the understanding it is broken from the perspective of a cloaked playerwe do not live on a chess board the bigger ships relying on brute force for combat defense have no need for concealmentthe smaller ships may choose to be exposed but they all need a defense capable of making them interesting to flyaspect two cloaking must never be an i win buttonwe will always have players who are more clever than the next guy and they will own the foolish without mercy if they choosecloaking should never provide leverage enabling foolish play to have undue advantageclever play should be the only path to thispilot skill must be the ultimate factor in conflicts whether cloaks are involved or notas to the method for every advantage or disadvantage changed from the current system give the other side a reasonable means to counter it do not give anyone absolute anything save that the highly skilled and clever should only feel threatened by equally skilled and clever opponentsupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
it is worth mentioning that faction weapon bpcs are another isk sink and require multiple sources of labour to create if should face a rebalance then including datarelic site materials would be a good addition on top of mining and tags
i doubt it tbh faction weapons generally use less cap and fitting and have a lower skill requirement in return for a little less dps no t2 ammo and less availability most doctrines will still be based on t2 imo
with your suggestion carriers will have a much larger tank a larger engagement range and twice the dps of a bs im saying that isnt acceptable and needs a valid drawback if you are going to boost carriers so much an appropriate drawback is to immobilize the carrier for attacking this doesnt work for your desired implementation though does it you want a im not stuck here for 5 minutes dps platform that outperforms bss and im not ok with that at all
your comparison works for dreadnoughts they have a much larger tank a larger range and 9 times the dps of bscarriers currently have about the same dps against bs and structures we are talking about increasing their damage on structures after all fighterbombers cannot hit bs can theyand the valid drawback is that dreads are still 5 times better than 5 fighterbombers and supers 4 times betterand if you say immobilize carriers then immobilize supers personally i think this whole immobilize thing to be a sitting duck is stupid well lets look at your logic supers and titans outperform bs and they are not immobile where is your logic oh but dreads that do 5 times the proposed damage are immobile so every ship has to be like that what about making every ship immobile while you are at it i am after options for smaller entities and this is one of the changes that could shake up eve not create more easy kills for the blobs well go figureas it is fighterbombers they have no impact on subcaps zilch rien yet the best you can come up with is make them immobile its a depressing thought that your alliance who i had a lot of respect for has someone in it that wants easy gank type kills sad to see it blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
super and titans cannot dock pilots are stuck in those ships until the ship dies that is what they sacrifice to gain the extra potential siege and triage modes give massive benefits to their ships in terms of tanking ewar immunity and functionality but come with the sitting duck dilemma agony is a small entity and when we drop capitals we know that bigger fish may come and destroy our stuff we understand you dont like the sitting duck drawback but that is the cost for the enhanced performance and you might be thinking in terms of smaller entities but you have to look at the big picture do you know what a slowcat fleet is it is a large fleet of remote rep sentry carriers you want to double their potential dps without drawbacks because you think it will help out small entities your change has repercussions throughout the game only one of your suggestions has a valid drawback you must fit drone control units to utilize fighterbombers why do carriers need  deserve a 100 increase in dps output towards structures
supers and titans deserve and get the extra damage and potential the proposal makes no real difference to thatof course i know what a slowcat is i want to see carriers have a separate fighter and drone bay remove this excessive number of drones and in return give them a bit more power against structures by choosing to pack fighterbombers i was wondering if you knew what slowcats were after you suggested that having fighterbombers would double the potential dps of slowcats which are as you correctly stated sentry focused carriers most of them hardly have any fighters on boardwhy do carriers not deserve an increase in dps against structuresand by the way i am not the op blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
yes please 
oh well so if i ecm burst or smartbomb and there is no one around it shouldnt cause aggression either but it doesits a broken mechanic dudeactivating the launcher should cause aggression
the quickest and easiest fix is to apply the same mechanic other area effect modules have no activation within 5k of a station or a gate just like smartbombs so if you want to bubble the station you have to be far enough away to be targetable and kill able before getting back to the safety of the station the station can still be covered just no easy safety
only smartbombs and some anchorable objects have this penalty ecm bursts hic bubbles dic bubbles etc dont
troll alertwoop woop woop woop
either allow turretsmissiles the assist options or remove them from drones make people play the gamebut in all seriousness remove drone assist completely and adhere to the same rules as turretsmissiles fighters and fighter bombers should be the only assistance able ships as they follow different rules eg are piloted manned fighters support the updating of rookie ships join the discussion
some input on aggro mechanics would be helpful lets keep the ideas coming ini am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
they make defending space way to easy with any fleet can hop regions in minutes
i realize fighterbombers would primarily be good against structures or stationary targets the slowcat would rarely utilize them against ships but much of the sov level fights involve shooting 100m ehp structures and the extra antistructure dps would really increase their utility i wish carriers had more conservative drone bays too separate fighter hangars would be the proper course imo frankly because carriers are already very powerful ships the antistructure dps would have them encroach on dread territory and the mobility  range they already enjoy when deploying fighters already gives them a nice niche to declaw poss from a safe distances furthermore the ability to assign fighters gives them yet another means to somewhat safely contribute to extra dps to small scale engagements many people myself included believe that capital rr is too potent and makes carriers moreless overpowered perhaps the fighterbomber option would be more reasonable if carriers fighterbomber control range was less than 150 kms pos disruptor range and if capital rr  triage with 4x rr ability were rebalanced so rr is 12 its current rep rate while triage increased rr 8x instead until the imbalances around carriers are addressed i just dont think increasing their utility is a good thing
that was a much better from the start i wanted the carriers to have a separate fighter bay to the drone bay and i still have to go back to the difference between a siege dread and a carrier with fighterbombers 10k vs 2kmy suggestion within the ops proposal would be to stop carriers being used as sentry drone boats but increase their ability in terms of fighters and fighterbombers no other changes i suggested this because i felt that the game would be better with a more focused carrier the question of impact in terms of making it very easy to take down towers is one issue so you range suggestion is a very valid point but i still think the rr is ok for small fleets it gets an issue at the larger scale but for my part i want the carriers to be a threat to supers and titans if packing fighterbombers but they would be very brittle with the right sized fighter bay which should be limited to 12 fighters and 5 fighterbombers so super smartbombing would clear them out effectively as a threat blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
and since thats an issue with supers and titans what does that have to do with carriers and why does it require them to be able to fulfill a role they werent designed foreven looking at it purely from a game balance perspective its still a terrible idea because it makes dreadnoughts a massively inferior choice for the one thing theyre supposed to be best at why would i use a group of dreadnoughts to shoot a structure when with your change a carrier group can do it in much greater safety no requirement to use siege mode plus the ability to refit off each other for escape with a minimal extra investment of time and resources higher buy in because you need a couple of extra carriers to match dps numbers and you spend slightly more on fuel compensated by not needing to buy strontium to fuel siege mode and spending nothing on ammunition in essence youre just adding to the problem of a group of carriers doing a bunch of different things better than the ships that are supposed to specialise in those things
no and simply no
using caldari as an example the base cargo of their transport ships arebadger  3900m3 tayra  7300m3charon  785000m3there is imho a clear need for a ship sitting between the industrial class and the freighter class vessels my proposal is that it would be circa 75000m3 base cargo capacity being 10x the industrial class and 110th of the freighter class as to what the remaining attributes and fitting options for such a vessel might look like i hope more experienced players than myself can suggest some informed ideas about the final look of such a ship but my ideas arebase cargo 50000m3 to 75000m3similar fitting options to an industrial class eg tayraalign time and warp speeds half way btw industrial and freighter valuesnew skill for piloting with the same skill related ship bonuses ie capacity and velocityjax
orca
i dont feel that theres a need for more industrials with a generally huge capacitythat said theres certainly room for more specialized haulers the gallente have 5 including three that have particularly huge specialized cargo bays each of which break the 50km3 mark after skills right now the only other specialized hauler is the minmatar hoarder with its ammo bay as such in terms of parity theres room for as many as 8 new t1 haulers which would make 5 for each race proposals involving suggestions for specialized bay types to go in these slots are likely to be looked upon more favourably than yet another request for a bigger hauler
more space i want more solar systemsthere is defiantly room for improvement on this part and would be awesome with thousands of more systemscould also be all 00 space for what i care it would make room for more alliances in 00 and or grow the existing ones
introductionany veteran pilot will tell you that the merciless and cruel universe of eve is the only true sandbox out there a place where you can set out to be whatever you wish as long as you have the patience and the skill to do so they will go on saying that itUFFFDs way more than just a game tell you about their latest adventure or link the eve is real trailer and shed a tear this is however not how a new player will see the game to the newcomer eve looks overcomplicated boring and populated by jerks and scammersthe current new player experience ie a 15days trial spent running tutorials does a good job at showing what eve looks like on the surface  a huge universe a ton of ships decades worth of skills many different professions etc but it doesnUFFFDt give any long term realistic vision of what eve is really about the new player hasnUFFFDt been encouraged to team up with other players sharing the same interests knows nothing about the dangers awaiting him right next door or what it means to be a fulltime industrialist a wspace dweller or a lowsec piratei believe many new players stop playing after their 15days trial simply because they didnUFFFDt feel welcome in the game and didnUFFFDt get to see its true potential of course eve is a very open sandbox game and itUFFFDs normal to leave a lot of its content hidden for the player to discover by himself but right now the new player experience hides way too much the game must remain the unforgiving place where stupidity is severely punished but i think it wouldnUFFFDt hurt to be a tiny bit more helpful towards the new playersi would like to propose a set of ideas that might help in getting new players more interested in the game and give them a better chance at surviving thus making them want to play long enough to actually discover what makes eve so enjoyable and unique1 extend trial periodfirst of all extend the trial period to 21 days 28 with buddy invite eve is a game that requires patience and time and this should be reflected by the trial however the first 15 days or less if the new player wishes so of this extended period should be dedicated to learning the game as i will explain next2 training constellations  reworked tutorial systemin each of the 4 empires highsec territories there would be a constellation or more if required which would be accessible only to pilots  accounts that are less than 15 days old these constellations would be connected to the rest of new eden via the chat system or the mailing system but would otherwise be entirely closed pockets following special rules designed to provide a safe environment for new players to learn the game where it would be very hard for a player to abuse another each training constellation would have its own separate market run by npc only separate agents and standings no playerrun corporations mission sites that canUFFFDt be probed no pvp mechanic of any kind etc no assets or isk could be transferred between these training constellations and the rest of new eden thatUFFFDs not exactly compliant with the great open sandbox that eve is however a new player could in such an environment in which he would only be for a maximum of 15 days learn properly the basics of the game be encouraged to try out things and cooperate safely with other players and be prevented from being abused by older players  heUFFFDll have plenty of time to experience that laterthe tutorials and lessons available to the new players inside the safe zone would teach them the basics show them what they can do and how to get started and most importantly cooperation would be strongly encouraged a UFFFDpartyfindingUFFFD system could be imagined where players can find other people to run the tutorials with i wonUFFFDt go into detail about what the tutorials should be about exactly thatUFFFDs not the point of my concept hereas an incentive to stay in the training constellations and learn things each tutorial completed would reward the new player with a certain amount of points with extra reward if completed in cooperation with other players in order to encourage teamplay and social connections all the points collected during their stay would be spent upon exiting the constellation to receive ships modules and isk on the outside it has the benefit of making new players want to run a lot of tutorials try everything out with no long term consequence and when they finally get out into the UFFFDreal spaceUFFFD they can pick assets from a list of available stuff that will be useful for what they actually liked doing during the tutorialsin addition this system will give new players motivation and time to make new friends sharing the same interest when they leave the training constellation they can do so with their newly met friends and team up from the beginning to survive in the harsh reality of new edencontinued in a 2nd post itUFFFDs a bit lengthy 
3 sponsoringolder players say 2 years could be allowed to pay a monthly isk fee yes pay to discourage abusing to be registered on a sponsors list new players would be offered the opportunity to browse this list and chose a sponsor based on his interests and the description he filled upon registering the new player and the sponsor would be introduced to each other and have a privileged way of communicating special chatroom or maybe just evemails  for the duration of the new playerUFFFDs trial upon completing the trial or when he choses to dismiss his sponsor the new player could leave a rating and a comment about the sponsor for other new players to seeiUFFFDm sure there would be a lot of older players interested in taking someone under their wing and answer their most basic questions it might not be as reliable as a good tutorial but it brings a human dimension which is capital in a mmo gameconclusioni am leaving out some details on purpose like UFFFDhow does a new player exit the training constellation via a special stargate a clonejump UFFFD UFFFDcan a player return to the constellation after leaving it UFFFD or UFFFDwould there be tutorial agents outside the training constellations UFFFD these are details that must be carefully thought of but donUFFFDt really impact the concept as a wholeso what does all this do  well in my opinion it changes everything instead of having a lonely noob thrown naked on day 1 into the most complex sandbox ever who will get abused of killed within a few days and quit forever you have a 15 days old pilot starting his life in new eden with a minimal understanding of the game a few assets he handpicked a goal of his own and probably a couple of friends he will still be an unskilled noob who will make mistakes regret choices and lose everything he has but at least heUFFFDll have a chance of knowing why and what he could have done differently because he was given the time to learn properlyi strongly believe this will help in making new players interested in the game and wanting to stay i am open to suggestions and critics if this idea gets support iUFFFDll try to work out more details and refine the concept a little bit morethanks for reading
overall a good idea except that tutorial agents are used for additional faction standingshow ever i believe the starter area can be 1 overall areathe 14 day account age could help from old people from making a new character on their account but not it the make a new account to get into easy groups to start awox and ransoms
thats not what theyre for and i wouldnt take that into account when designing tutorial agents tbh and i also suggested that there could still be some tutorial agents outside training constellations its not really a key point of the conceptyou will of course never be able to prevent an existing player to make a new account and pretend to be a beginner to start abusing others but the idea here is to make training constellations a place where it is hard and not profitable to take advantage of noob players there will be less abuse if there are less means to abuse others and safer rules allow for more encouragement to learn and teamplay with others people bullying beginners will always be there and thats fine really i just think discouraging them from doing that in the 15 first days would help past that point its all good 
i know that hence the suggestion on a fix just treat the deployable bubble like a smart bomb leave the hictor and ecm burst as is that or if your not in space the bubble pops like you loose control of drones
i get it im not sure how it would be implemented but it would have to be quite a radical overhaul of how things are done now as it is i dont think the player base would be willing to accept such a change but perhaps one of the newer mmos coming out will do something like this
the reason for faction prices being so high is you dont need the advanced training to use the but they can function on around that if t2 t2 ammo isnt all that its very limiting except for so missiles there is no middle ground for a lot of t2 ammo which is also why faction ammo cost more than t2 ammo example is artillery has quake at a very short range then tremor at very long range on the other hand you can get every flavor of ammo type as republic navy and have a wide range of distance and damage types
i personally think jump bridges are a good thing i think the ability to take alternative routes to encircle your enemy is awesome what needs to happen is a mechanic that limits how much jump travel you can make in an hour or a day
jump bridges really dont take all that much off normal travel times as i mentioned in marlona skys teleportation thread if youre trying to cross from one end of the universe to the other even the best jb network in the game will only save you 13 of your timealso since jbs are fixed in place they arent nearly as disruptive as say titan bridges theyre also a lot softer targets than titans and can be disabled with a lot less effort than itd take to eliminate a titan much less multiple titans or better yet camped and thus rendered temporarily nonusable in the same sense as any other gate could be
its very interesting that everyone keeps pointing to individual things that can do and conclude that arent overpowered yes and as my post says if could only do a few of those things they would be pretty balanced in my opinion its the fact that sbs can do all of them and are such a short train that makes them need rebalancinga lot of you have also grossly misunderstood what i meant about good against small ships its almost like you guys read that tagline and didnt read the part where i talk about initial tackle for gank not 1v1 though i have linked a very successful solo sb pilot as tangential as that islets start with the very first part where i answer your very first questionnow go read the rest of my post to answer all of the rest of your questions
you didnt and that doesnt show it to be over powered it just shows you whining over a mechanic you dont understand simply tackling a small ship doesnt make the bomber over powered without other ships the bomber is as good as dead give me an ab af and ill kill 10 bombers by myself easily
is there any reason why the missile skills are harder to train than other turret skills for example when i train for small autocannon and artillery specializations i would train the relevant projectile turret skill to 5 then train into the specializationnow when i want to train for either rocket or light missile specializations there is no small missiles skill that builds into those specializations i would have to train both rockets to 5 then light missiles to 5this seems massively unfair on those that use missiles it seems like the obvious thing to do would be to change it so that the individual missile skills light missiles rockets heavy missiles heavy assult missiles cruise missiles and torpedos should be replaced with small missiles medium missiles and large missiles and keep the specialities the same
its simple really surprised that you cannot see it and even more surprised that you cannot work out why they are called carriers the suggestion is that they carry fighterbombers too and a limited number at thatyou are not looking at the game balance all you can say is never meant but when you look at game balance you have to assess the impact it has dreadnoughts will still have their use they are five times the dps in siege still a damn good reason to use them also fighterbombers are not cheap eitherthey are carriers why would they being doing a role they were never intended to do also dreads do 5 times the dps so its not better the only thing they have going for them is survivability and it adds options for smaller groups simple as and taht is game balance blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
counterproposal give me a reason to even bother going there without offering higher rewards than other parts of the game
you actually do realize that most of null sec space is barely used right and that ccp is planning inb4 walking in stations disaster 20 to implement player build stargates which lead to undiscovered systemsalso wh spacethe low class whs are barely used as welland basically what caleb saidempire space sadly is still one of the more profitable regions for individuals
ah yes the undiscovered systems that i do look forward to empire space is pretty decent in profitability thats true and also 00 entities could also just easily conquer any more normal 00 space added to the game i guess im just so tired to watch the same entities ruling 00 all the time
you are right it should be made consistent either apply the current timer mechanic like smartbomb or the one i propose to all thoseconsistency is great when it comes to aoe mechanics hictor bubbles too indeedregarding hictors what is the curent game mechanicif you use focused point you got timer but if u use bubble mode you dontwould be odd since in 1 case you prevent 1 ship to warp but in the second you might prevent 10 or 100 from doing so

i totally support this im new to eve 3 weeks now  never got to experience these agents  missions i can tell you with the current setup after finishing the aura  career agents i was totally lost it was a serious now what moment i knew the basic mechanics of the basics i didnt  probably still dont understand the political mechanics  undertones between factions i had to search around wikis to figure out where to go i think there is a huge gap after the career agents i really enjoyed up to the career agent point then i almost quit i forced myself through the steep learning curve  i think im headed in the right direction at this pointanything to help new players like myself with the intimidation factor of this game is a good thingps im still trying to figure out how to crack the whole storyline thing i did one sister of eve epic arc but now noone wants to talk with me i think ive read i get only 1 storyline quest for ever 16 grinding missions seriousely is there a good story to this game i hope its not just grinding
michael tiernanthanks for showing support for this proposal and welcome to evei understand your situation and agree that the game basically places you into the deep end with no direction after the level 1 soe epic arcfor a good story plot within this game you might want to check out some of the other event agents i have most of them listed in the plan along with some tips and guide linkstry not to get discouraged this game gets a lot better after youve put in some timedmc
given that ccp have never provided a single response on a single thread related to the idiocy of the current afk cloak mechanic in the last 8 years i see little chance that they will extract a digit and respondcomment nowi am glad to say another brainless  has decided to start camping my current home system 2357  this has now been going on nearly continuously for 5 months in all nearby upgraded systems each person finally works out it is a useless griefing tactic that eliminates pve and pvp content just in time for the next  to appearand on that happy note ccp and csm can continue to ignore the most commented longrun issue in the game without a single attempt to improve it
frankly i dont know the details of your camper nor do i honestly care toi would suggest however that they have either called your bluff or they are themselves bluffingby this i mean to say that they are implying that they have the means to cyno in additional forces at just the moment where your ships would be vulnerableconsidering that unless you are mining in titans or some equally ridiculous high value target they probably have not the means nor motivation to actually back that up except at specific times so you can call their bluff most of the timenow if you show up in some easy to kill soft target then they only need a relatively trivial force to handle it such forces i would expect are easier to come by and should be considered available more of the timeso when you call their bluff make it with something they think of as a hard target put in that nice cyno jamming tech so only covert cynos can be used tooif they feel an absolute need to attack make sure they need to drown in the isk required while you are out only what you can easily affordmany battles are won and lost on excel docs with ships never appearing make the numbers work for youupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
easy to come up with ways to catch them once or twice or three times involving other players and ships then they reship and are back in 10 minutes there is no counter that works for months until ccp bother their butts and think 00 is a waste of space full of station spinning players
i dont think you dont have a problem with the mechanic i believe you have a problem with your expectationsnow you imply the problem is the possibility of other players showing up when you are not readyi agreebut rather than the other player being limited as to when they can show up i would much rather see you less limited about when you can be readyi feel that we log into mmo games to interact not to avoid others or we defeat the purpose of playing an mmo at alli think we should look for ways to allow players to be ready for interaction better not be incentivized to avoid each otherupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
cloaky ships are balanced by the simple mechanic that when uncloaked they are extremely easy to kill what the carebears are complaining about is that they cant dock up their little ratting ship at the first sign of threat and have a way to stay hidden in their station until said threat goes away so they can go back to making their isk
standard rubbish  simplistic incorrect response no concerns about active players cloaking  afk cloaking is a pile of dog turd someone logging in after dt then staying in system closes it down for anything other than fleet ratting or ratting in crap ships  so you might as well just missionincursion in high sec get rid of this pos and you will get more pve and pvp content in null  there will be people undocked worth shooting
i feel you are being disingenuous hereyou are suggesting that you are wanting to use a ship that is simply not competent to deal with hostilesbecause the hostiles that are indicated as threatening you are believed to be cloaked you avoid them by not using the shipyou leave out this which is an obvious detail which i feel bears stating in this contextyou would avoid any hostile you believed to be a threat simply because you are not piloting a ship you would choose to have any unplanned encounter withcloaked  uncloaked no difference you want to have the opportunity to swap ships so you feel better preparedi am giving you presumed intention of being willing to fight herei believe it is not reasonable to expect competing players to give you a safety advantage just so you can feel more secure using a relatively defenseless vesseli think it is more reasonable that you should play the spaceship flying mmo in a spaceship that can deal with meeting other playersif that means we need to make your pve ship into something more practical lets consider that directioni feel blocking player interaction because it is not convenient for you makes no sense for an mmoupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
then remove cloakers from local problem solved only active players are a threat
its because missiles work on entirely different mechanics than turretsturrets are split between ranged types short and long they have tradeoffs such as damage and tracking missiles are straight classed no tracking each missile is designed to fight a particular type of ship not to mention that unless the enemy is speed tanking extremely well there is no way for a missile to miss within its effective range or score anything other than a moderate hitthe way range damage and general engagements work between the two weapon types is why they have different skills missiles are inherently tools specialized for their individual jobssorry if post has some redundancies in it im tired
well as long as bringing 10x the people to the fight is a guaranteed win then the ones who can bring 10x the people will dominate and as long as they dominate people will just join them bloating their numbers more because joining anything smaller is pointlessthis is the big counter to people who argue bring more friends whenever the arguement about sov availability to smaller entities comes up since the game is at a point that the large entities only real threat is from other old large entities no new group can really start up without eithera not threatening the sov of the bigger groupsb just joining the bigger groups and be petsrentersand you cant make more friends to pose a threat because all the friends to be made are already out in null in the big entitiesand no matter how much or what kind of space ccp adds this will always be the case nullsec is an old guard playground and until someone does something extremely stupid it will remain so hell even if the cfc split up and went to all out war on eachother whoever survived would be in quick order to setup as many renters and new blue alliespets as they can to maintain the old status quo
a good idea overall and this should maybe help out newly started players to get a possible view of things to come for them in eve when joining up with a real corp one thing i dont like is the sponsoring i believe a bit of self exploring and earning by themself is not bad
to the csm and the player basei am here today to request a simple but high results driven request concerning the eveonline forums more specifically i would like to focus on the alliance  corporation recruitment center area of the forums currently the structure and overall usability is very low there are currently 855 pages with thousands of different threads containing the recruitments ads for corporations and alliances pirates and carebears touting their trades and individual players looking at options that are available for them  however all of this is seemingly posted without any organization in mind it can often take several pages to find a players looking for request and then it usually is not compatible with your corporations culture so what we have is an outdated and cluttered resource that does not fulfill the roles it was designed forin a game like eve where player interactions is one of the driving selling points of the game and where statistics have shown the likelihood of player retention is higher when a player has joined an active player corporation it is a wonder why the recruitment forums have not been updated soonercurrent structureeve corporations alliances and organizations centeralliance  corporation recruitment centercorporation alliance and organization discussionshow to restructure organizational topics and subtopics eve corporations alliances and organizations centercorporation recruitment centerhighsec corporation advertisements player request lowsec corporation advertisements player request nullsec corporation advertisements player request wormhole corporation advertisements player request alliance recruitment center highsec alliance advertisements corporation request lowsec alliance advertisements corporation request nullsec alliance advertisements corporation request wormhole alliance advertisements corporation request corporation alliance and organization discussionsthis is the first step adding simple folders to help organize the massive influx of new recruitment adds this also allows corporations and players to make searching for their new home or new corpmate easier now instead of having to search pages to find a highsec or a lowsec corporation a player can just open the appropriate subtopic and begin their search right away on the reverse side a player can post their looking for request in the appropriate subtopic which will allow them to be found quicker and easier by recruiting corporations the above also holds true for corporations seeking to join an alliancein the end this is a simple and quick fix to help resolve a disorganized and painfully slow search for a new corporation a few man hours of restructuring this one forum section and the return benefits are more active corporations and higher player retentionthank you for your time and i hope the csm and players can get behind this little fix
