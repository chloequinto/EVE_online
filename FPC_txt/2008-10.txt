"signed.the naglfar needs both a damage boost and tank boost for the extra amount of skill/training required to fly it. this needs fixing."

"what are you talking about? it jams just fine. the exact same as a falcon, with less range (but you don't need a falcons range in non-fleet battles, and who would bring a widow to a fleet battle?)"
"get this into your head. a ship operating alone or in the presence of a very small covert gang needs more capabilities than their t1 variants, not less. these ships are not survivable behind enemy lines. and no, they can't jump long ranges, they actually jump very short ranges.black ops ships aren't logistics ships, so your point of their combat ability behind second to their logistics capabilities kind of just proves my point. c o m b at ship."
"also happens if you try and contract a ship with a damaged drone afaik, this needs to be fixed though."
"wrong. drones also have this problem.tbh even tho i've had problems with this in the poast myself i don't want to support it. when enemies take over your station you should lose stuff, you shouldn't just be able to sell it from a distance on contracts. where's the risk vs reward in that?"
"i'd point out to you that an outpost is worth somewhat more than a battleship. i'd also point out to you that it affects plenty of people other than those who have their outposts captured - try having two hangars 30-40 jumps apart and trying to contract a ship in the one you're not at. it's not as frustrating as having the whole ship unavailable to you, but it's still unnecessarily annoying."
"then make it true of any ship with any faction ammo or any t2 ammo. why punish amarr? i can repair drones, but i cant repair crystals."
"this would be a great change, please do it!edit: it would be even better if we could somehow have a default wallet for say mission rewards and bounties, so say everything i gain from missions goes to wallet 6 while all the money i get from selling stuff on the market goes to wallet 5 or something."

"if you look past the (rather selfish) 'i don't like it when i can't pew pew jf in lowsec anymore' and ask the question: 'why can they jump out of highsec but can't jump in?'that's like taking the train and having to use the bus on your way back.i wouldn't mind if jf could only jump in lowsec to lowsec or 0.0. jumping into low-sec and then cyno out is even lower risk then jumping next to high-sec and then jump through. that's no biggie to me really. if you can't light the cyno in highsec you shouldn't be able to jump out of it as well.there is a reason you can't light cynos in high-sec. to avoid caps jumping in and pwning concord. but the only thing you can do with a jf is bumping another ship and that's it.remember the erebus that was stolen by the serpentis? it was stolen in high-sec so this means factions are allowed to have supercaps in high-sec. it also implies that its technically possible to jump caps and supercaps to high-sec. so why would a faction not allow jf to jump back into highsec? because you like to shoot them? (i do to btw)"
"no. jump freighters already make 0.0 logistics far too easy. i remember having to escort freighter convoys from 0.0 to empire on a weekly basis. now all that work is done by a couple of cyno alts and jump freighters which makes it practically impossible to cut off an enemy's supply lines."

"while it sounds good in principle, how do you quantify it? what do you have to do in order to qualify for the official rubber stamp of 'roleplay alliance'?who do you let in and who do you turn down, just where do you draw the line?"
"i couldn't comment on that, not being a rper myself. just the alliances i think of when i think of rpers - ushra'khan, electus matari, pie, cva, star fraction (doubt they would join fw though) etc"
"you fail to see that nearly the entire fw population is against this. yet you find a few supports here worthy to push your personal agenda... wow. you are blinded by your jade online.try running your wealthy alliance sov towers, outposts, and maintaining 0.0 space inside a corp. disbanding an alliance for fw gives them all the power to be a part of fw, and not just be an alliance instigator inside fw. there are ways you can be a part of fw, i suggest you do it... alliances will break fw completely. there's absolutely no reason for an alliance to be involved... none."
"not true in the slightest. some of the long list of supporters in this and similar threads include pie, 17tw, ammatar free, maak, and other major players in fw. in addition, the entirety (as near as i can see) of the rp community supports it, including cva, em, and u'k. besides one or two members from slackers and a handful of individuals unwilling to display affiliation, who do you see against it? as to jade, well, sf has publically declared all militias red based on their own politics. so i think it's reasonable to claim that jade is not doing this for personal motivations, but because jade, as an rper, understands this to be a necessary change for the whole of the rp community.right, there's absolutely no reason for groups such as electus matari and ushra'khan, who have been central to the freedom fighting business since before 99% of fw players started playing, to be involved in the war against slavery. no reason at all for cva, who has arguably done more to expand the borders of the empire (at least in an rp sense) than anyone else alive in the empire, for being allowed to participate in the reclaiming.none at all.[/sarcasm]the problem here is that you seem to think that every alliance in the game is bob or goons. most alliances are considerably smaller, and most of the alliances that would even care to be in fw hold no space (exception: cva). and the huge alliances that could get involved just to screw with things ... can already do so! the goons wouldn't need to join fw to park their capital fleets in the bleak lands, they could do so tomorrow. there's a reason they don't."
"dual, yes, thank you as becq starforged said, it can be easily nerfed to take out any shananagins.is equal and fair to all (as stated)yes, it has been brought up before. with the current news article it was time to push the importance of this gain.there is no reason why not to do it."
"dual, as said... duel means grinding for exp, and that's one thing i'm thankfully glad eve does not have.anyway... i agree, and so do many others.as stated in the many other threads, there needs to be an approach along two different paths.a) backup skill. once your initial skill completes it automagically begins training the second skill you've defined as your backup skill (generally a nice long skill).b) 24 hour skill que. this would allow you to select existing skills (not skillbooks) totalling 24 hours, with the final skill allowed to surpass the end of the timer. this would be perfect for those short skills.c) dual training - i personally do not go for this, as it slows down the progress of *both* skills and is no better than the current system."
"while i am in favor of a skill training queue, i have a hard time following your logic:the existance of a eula violating macro that contains a trojan is not a sound reason to ask for a change in game mechanics."
"if people are desperate enough to work around your game mechanics via a mechanism likely to put a virus on their computer, perhaps that's a sign that your game mechanic is frustrating, and thus possibly change-worthy. given that this isn't an issue of balance or anything of the sort, and the frustration is entirely needless, there isn't a very good reason for them not to change it (seriously, \"it makes players log in\"? wtf?). i'm not sure if that's the op's logic here, but it's at least a plausible bridge from a to b."

"the concept that ccp cannot or will not reimburse ship losses when their hardware failed because it would set a dangerous precedent is ludicrous. ccp needs to own up to the fact that their troublesome goal of supporting and actively promoting massive fleet battles on said weak hardware/software/network is a max fail and reinstate these pilots ships. be men and have honor. battles should be won and lost fairly, not on the failure of your game due to poor planning and crappy support."
"i agree with shinma, and its not about loosing the ship its how we lost them, i would gladly loose a ship in combat thats fair and where we are able to fight back, but when you stare at a black screen for 4 hours only to see damage notifications but nothing else is not how you want to loose a 3 billion isk investment."

"little logic problem:- logging more data to check if the player had not loaded when killeld use up more server capacity and database capacity;- using up more server capacity will reduce further the size of usable fleet;- as people will not reduce the fleets more crashes will occur. end results: more ship losses, longest petitions queue, ship are reimbursed after months. option 2.- data are stored player side;- some player discover how to hack the data day 2 of the change;- no one ever loss a ship in pvp."
"invert step 3 and 5 and what you get?your ship will lock and start firing before being registered by the other players. so you will need a step 6. ship is frozen and invulnerable until all other ship have acknowledged his presence on grid. but at that point you can simply say: ship will never load in a fleet battle."
"i fully endorse this suggestion."

"understandable, everyone knows that the golden rule in eve is not to fly something you cant afford to loose, thats not the issue here, personally i had bought a new carrier and had it fitted and back up in tribute as soon as i was finally able to load into my medical clone, the point of this is that anyone who looses a ship this way shouldnt just be expected to eat it, honestly if the gbc posted something like this should they have lost ships in a situation like this i would support them in saying they should be re-embursed as well, we may be enemies in game but that doesnt mean they deserve to have thier in-game experiences ruined because of a hardware problem thats outside of their control"
"oh dear."
"adding one reply packet to the end of the initial grid-loading data stream to make/confirm player intractability is hardly going to cause a bump in server performance.'it might be hacked' is hardly a good reason to not fix such obvious issues.implement properly and it won't get hacked without a lot of effort."
"i've heard this and similar statements quite a lot last weeks, but it is not true. ccp won't lose accounts if the gtc prices go up.people don't understand that, they cancel their account because of a high gtc price and think there is one subscribed account less because of this, but that's not the case, the gtc which they would have bought is bought by someone else. only the gtc generates money for ccp, and the number of gtcs don't become less if you don't get one.the gtc market is currently a \"seller's market\", every gtc that is offered will quickly find a buyer. there are more buyers than sellers, not every buyer will get a gtc, so some will offer to pay more (in order to get the gtc instead of another buyer), that's why the price is rising. if ccp would put up a fixed price, this wouldn't help you, there would still be more buyers than sellers and some buyer would still get no gtc (probably the sales would be done to people the sellers know as favour, or people would offer additional isk (inofficially) to get one of the few rare gtc, this would create lot's of mess, no benefits)."
"it is a nice option to buy game time codes with ingame currency.it is not a guaranteed right to to get them cheap.if you want cheaper gtcs on the market, you have to buy gtcs and sell them cheap.but why would you do that? you wouldn't. and if: let me know. so why would anyone else? people demand the price that is paid. part of any capitalism."

"yes this.i'm not sure if rigged ships give more components to build rigs again, but if they dont then they should aswell."
"caveat: current corpses in storage 'decay' and can't be retro-autopsied.we should also be able to fabricate 'tags' from the corpses. non-commodity items, just database dross like fullerine shards and blood drops. trophies.copper tags for randomly scooped corpses.brass tags for corpses where the coroner pilot is on the ship kill (within 120 seconds of subsequent pod kill).gold tags for corpses where the cornoner pilot was on the ship killcrystal tags for corpses where the coroner pilot was in on the pod kill or final blow versus the ship.diamond tags for corpses where the cornoner pilot was final blow on the pod."
"as the header suggests this concerns command ships in relation to their t2 bc counterparts.are there any csm who have tried to champion the cause of the cs, particularly the nh (or are interested in doing so)?failing that, does anyone know if (since the advent of the t2 bc) any dev has commented on the usefullness of this class in relation to the newer bc's? i know ship ballance \"tweaks\" are few and very far between. i really don't know why this is, but i would like to.for instance(to shamelessly rip off another dudes post...)stabber powergrid: 700 nighthawk powergrid: 710sleipner powergrid: 1460, +1 hislotnh simply dosen't have enough pg to fit vital mods in pvp. having only 5 meds give it no ability to tank+tackle that the drake does, and it's lower hp and less rigslots than the drake means it dosen't really passive tank all that much better either. you can't active tank it either, since with an mwd it also needs a cap injector as well as a lsb which is complete overkill for the powergrid. even attempting to fit hams is futile.. don't even try to fit a command module, this ship class's supposed niche...simply put the nighthawk dosen't do anything a ham drake couldn't do, and it can't even tackle.please also look at command ships in relation to their t2 bc counterparts and tell us whether or not a gross infringement of class niche has occured across the board or individually."
"if you cut nighthawk optimal to sleipnir level sure buff it grid. like 2km optimal oin your nightfall? hope so."
"and the nh gets the same speed & agility and dps as the sleipnir as well, right?"
"lol yea and the ability to fit a practical x-large shield booster tank with high amounts of dps. it's very imbalanced."
"current imbalance is in:zealot -> absalutioncerber -> nighthawkboth are missing 1 turret. vaga 5 turrets, sleipnir 7. deimos 5 turrets, astarte 7. but both nh and absolution have 5->6 turrets."
"yes, because balance is decided by pretty patterns of numbers, rather than by considered examination of combat utility. seriously though, the nighthawk's pg is hopelessly inadequate and the ship is unusable in its intended role in pvp. the csm has, however, voted through this issue and will bring it to ccp's attention soon.but really, all of the field cs have problems to some extent. the sleipnir is best off, being able to fit a gang mod, xlsb and weapons (this would take 5 rcu iis on the nighthawk!), but all of them have problems fulfilling their role."
"you do not understand computer security, passwords or the way they are stored.with the correct settings your pc will prevent you reusing an old password. the network at your office should do the same. so should all the websites you use. they should also tell you to change your password on a regular basis.this is good security practice.passwords are not stored in plain text. they are encrypted to prevent people looking at them. this is as true of your windows pc, your work servers and eve as it is your bank. so the devs can't find out your passwords. (ok thats a simplification but it's very difficult for them to do so)using the same password for multiple accounts is bad security practice. rotating a set of 3 or 4 passwords when you're told to change them is very bad security practice.so.... ccp should continue their practices and you really need to change yours quick before someone steals your money by hacking your gmail account."
"sigh.let's say ccp uses sha1 for hashing. that's pretty much as generic as you can get these days. if you can produce a collision within a reasonable amount of time, then you should go publish it in a paper somewhere and you will be world famous. you'll also be targeted by intelligence agencies all over the world, but it's the price of genius i guess.even if you produce that collision (and become world famous / kidnapped by the nsa), it's a hashing function, so even collisions won't (probability-wise)get you anything useful.in the mean time, i stick with my opinion that you are just terribly misinformed.edit:i just saw (again) your post on the first page.i seriously think you should listen to your own advice.ps. qft makes no sense in that last sentence. learn internet acronyms."
"and that's great, assuming you can give everybody the ability to remember a large and ever-growing number of wholly random strings of nonspecific ascii. in reality, what you'll get is the aforementioned list of all passwords sitting on the person's desk(top) in plaintext. there's a reason people hate password security, and it's because they're not capable of meeting your rules. for that matter, i have one of the best memories for that sort of thing of any person i've ever met - every card number in my wallet is memorized after about three uses - and i don't even try to implement \"proper\" password security, because i can't do it. your ideas of password security are right up there with communism - great in theory, so long as your theory is wholly untainted by contact with reality."

"this. the mechanic shouldn't convert slaves into freed slaves; it should collect slaves and provide ... something, perhaps lp or standings. in effect, the slaves are being retrained and returned to npc society. if they are returned to the players as 'freed slaves', they are still livestock.and yes, the mechanics are already there in the form of cosmos trade agents. just drop a cosmos-style \"freedom camp\" out in amamake with a agents that accept slaves, freed slaves, elite slaves, kameiras, etc. in exchange for lps, and the matari part of this is done. the amarrian equivalent (\"slave-training facility\") would accept refugees and the like. since the gallente/caldari war is a little less idealisting, perhaps they are looking for refugees (their citizens captured behind enemy lines), militia (pows) and similar.i'd also like to see these sorts of 'commodities' dropped by fw complexes, which could tie into a minor set of rewards for those participating in the system capture portions of fw. by adjusting the drop rate per complex and the lp/whatever reward per commodity, it should be easy to make the rewards become an asset to fw participants without becoming a get-rich-quick scheme."

"best solution to the problem would be to remove the effect of the q-level and of the system security level of the system from the lp/isk rewards paid out by the agent.instead implement a multiplier like this:high-sec: 1xlow-sec: 2x0.0: 3xthis would make all l4's in the same security zone give exactly the same rewards, and you could choose freely where you wanted to mission. if a mission hub became too crowded, you could just move.would of.c. also work for l1-3's, but this is not too important."
"that... is a good idea."
"i'm not sure why they don't do this already. there is no measurable difference in safety levels between 1.0 and 0.5, or between 0.4 and 0.1; the only differences are between high-sec, low-sec, and null-sec. i would suggest basing the reward on the sec-status of the mission location, though, rather than the agent mission. an agent on the border of low-sec should give increased payoffs for their missions that take the pilot into low-sec."
"same here, amarr are great to mission for, it just requires a half hour or so looking through eve-agents and a map =]btw i think i know the system you're talking about, there's a rather nice cluster of amarr l4 agents together there ^^"

"if this means removing agents from high sec..... don't even bother trying to propose it.however... if this leaves high sec untouched and only affects 4's and 5's?fine... i don't see a problem with it going out there to low-sec.the only issue is the extortionists and pirates would have even more prey than usual... but on the upswing.... no concord interference means more baiting of those same pirates... they'd have to watch there backs. : o )would make for an interesting industry.but don't nerf the agents in high sec.... unless i mis-read it."
"i'm pretty sure he means alliances having the ability to hire new agents, not move around the old ones. it shouldn't affect highsec at all, unless it's to move players out of it and towards nullsec."
"it's got my vote then.provided high sec remains untouched.i realize that alot of you \"pros\" want more peeps out there in null sec.... but you will never get them all out of there.some people are just not into eve in that fashion.however with the climb in stupidity reaching epic levels in high sec (suicide ganking, mission ganking, war-dec-greifing, etc..etc..etc) i suspect more will be showing up just for the change in scenery and not getting bound down by concord rules.so yeah... thumbs up."

"this would be about the worse thing for new players ever ! you will shelter them in the early days when they basically pvp on a lvl playing field just against similar sp pilots making them feel nice and safe in their ignorance. then when they feeling uber in a bc or a bs with 3 mil sp's or whatever you turn them out of this safe hunting ground of low sp players and low and behond a pilot in a cruiser or even a frig comes along and tears them a new one, losing them a expensive fit bc or bs thus pulling the rug completely out from under their feet and making them drown in the knowledge that all the learned up to then is not a lot of use and they got to go back to frigs and cruisers themselves as just lost all the ships and isk they made up to this point. better they put a time limit on being in npc corps and get players in player run corps where they can learn the trade they choose under guidence and mentorship of others."

"as a trader myself i would love this idea"
"previous thread on ammunition swappingi'll be surprised that this hasn't been suggested, but wouldn't an easy lag solution be to make all guns 'clip-less'. make it so that you have an 'ammo bay' on each ship that can take a certain m3 of (whatever type) rounds.make all of the guns load directly from this ammo bay, such that the firing rate is continuous (as with an amarr ships currently). dpses may need to be rebalanced based on the type of ammunition.1.) we eliminate the a lot of the server load from reloading and tracking the current clip of 6-8 guns. we replace it with one 'ammo bay' object. furthermore, this is the type of behavior that can be *predicted* (rof * number of guns * time = rounds spent) allowing for further server side optimization in high load situations. you don't have to check as often to see if the ships guns still have something to fire/are firing, you check once on activation, deactivation, type change and at a time when we have calculated that you should be 'getting low'.although you will still track 1 or 2 ammunition types this is hardly different from tracking the ammunition in a cargo hold. we will essentially reduce the algorithmic level of complexity *exponentially*, as we are no longer really worrying about moving around small ammunition objects every so often and tracking 8 different objects, we are now tracking 1 or two ammunition attributes within the ammunition bay object, 2.) we reduce the currently huge advantage that amarr ships have in lagged fleet battles. no reloading = no reloading lag = insanely higher dps (10 to literally infinite higher dps, depending on amount of lag). (there is a reason 15 revs died in m-0 the other day, bob knows what they are doing and the rev is far and away the best dread).amarr ships still have the advantage of not having to manage ammunition/ammunition bay, and will still be *excellent* choices for fleet battles, just not the *only* choice as they are now.3.) we can have the desired effect of instantaneously switching ammunition types. this results in a number of interesting situations, where there may be a tactical advantage to switching ammunition types. you'll note two things here: first is that we are not dealing with clips anymore. we no longer have to move objects during battle at all, instead we decrement a counter. changing ammunition is now a matter of changing a pointer object rather than moving 8 objects (a pointer change should be a comparatively free operation)."
"tbh, i think we should just all agree to use smartbombs. no amoo issues, no reloading, no drone lag, local numbers would plummet due to lack of pods being around, blobs would melt under their own weight, and the geddon and phoon would probably be the only two battleships worth flying!"
"i wasn't too keen on this when i first read the titel, but by the time i'd got through the text it does seems to make sense and be a workable solution. it also solves another issue i have where if you don't have enough ammo to fully reload the entire bank of guns, there is no way (other than manually splitting stacks) to split your remaining ammo between them to maintain your dps.only thing that concerns me is you mention rebalancing of dps - have to say it is rare that i run out of ammo, have to reload and keep firing. generally i reload as i go, and select moments in the battle where the 10 second reload does not interfere with my shooting."
"i've never written code for an online game so i'm not really sure how much of an effect this would truly have. you used the word \"exponentially\" how about more concrete answers? fancy words don't mean much.a removal of an advantage for a specific weapon type as a counter to lag is something i simply cannot agree on without giving something to compensate.also removes the consequences of not being properly prepared or making a poor decision.i think time spent improving performance as well as upgrading server architecture to better handle the load is a better alternative."
"\"exponentially\" most certainly does have a concrete meaning. i would suggest you look it up instead of criticizing people for your own ignorance."
"exponentially is hardly a fancy word.if n is the number of guns:well for each reload you have n ammunition objects being moved into n number of guns. and an object update to the cargo bay. you also have n counters being decremented by 1 for each gun for each shot, n objects being altered for each gun, for each volley. this is of cubic exponential complexity. (n squared * reload) + (n squared * volley).(max 64 operations *reloads + 64 operations * volleys)in the proposed system, there are three possibilities:1.) 1 counter that decrements the ammunition in the bay once for each shot.(n * volley) second order complexity(max 8 operations * volleys)2.) 1 counter that decrements the ammunition in the bay once for each volley.(volleys) linear complexitymax operations 1 * volleys3.) the predictive approach-- do two calculations. on gun activation we calculate how long the ship can fire its guns with its current ammunition. if we reach this point we deactivate the guns. on gun deactivation (manual or otherwise), we do an update to the database about how many rounds are left (using our previous equation guns*rof*duration). client display of ammunition is tracked by the individual client. if we are firing for a particularly long time, and there is a possibility of desynch, we do run our rof*duration calc occasionally to make sure everyone is up to date.this is of a constant complexity (2). in particularly long firing sessions, this will be of a duration 2+ additionalchecks. in most cases, (firing a few volleys then reloading) it will be complexity 2. i agree completely, however amar currently outclass other races by so much in certain situations that it is foolish not to fly their ship type (better to bring a t1 amarr bs than a t2 of other races, much of the time), this is entirely because of their advantage of not having to reload all of the time (they would actually maintain their stated benefit of 'not using ammunition'. that is true, my point was more in response to wrangler's quote, that they do not want people reloading/changing ammo all of the time because of the lag issues involved. we can certainly maintain a penalty for switching from one ammunition type to the other, i was merely stating that the penalty would no longer be mandatory."
"zomg i have never thought of this"
"interesting idea. i don't think it'll reduce lag at all, since reloading is so much rarer an operation than firing, but it does have a few other benefits. most notably, you don't lose dps when you have 3 guns worth of ammo left for 8 guns, and you have to f1-f8 less often. you'd have to drop the rof of ammo-using weapons a little bit to compensate for this, which the pvpers won't like, but the difference would be small. also, your math seems flawed - where do you get the o(n^2) from? each firing of n guns decrements n ammo counters and does n damage calculations, and each reload decrements the ammo stack in your hold n times and increments n ammo counters. both of those operations are o(n), meaning that there's not room for more than constant improvement."
"no having the clip and force activation of guns makes each type of weapon unique they would have to redo every weapon system again if they were o go all clip-less as well as balance cargo space."
"rotflmaoepic fail.google mathematics and the key word exponents.as for the idea.... don't think that would fix lag as so much... even if it did... it would be rather smallish in effect.valid points however as far as the programing aspect goes.but i don't think it would effect much of a change.but i do like the idea of ammo bay as opposed to clips.storing the ammo in a separate cargo \"slot\" much like a drone bay would prevent me from accidentally yanking my ammo out^_^;"
"i never really understood the intelligence behind the ammo \"clip\". these ships would have the local ammo storage by the gun in order to keep a steady stable feed of ammunition, however the ship would also have a system to keep ammunition moving between the ships ammunition magazine and the individual gun magazines.for those who claim the amarr will loose their \"no reload\" advantage think of this: you still are not paying for your ammunition.the only thing not mentioned is ammunition swapping. as long as the ships magazine can hold multiple types of charges and it still takes 10 seconds to change what type of round you are using i support this idea."

"i think npc tax should reflect the risk reward model of eve. to me it has more to do with that than anything else. while i think it is a good idea to encourage players to join player corps, people shouldn't be forced. this is a sandbox game, there should be a choice, but it should be a choice which both sides have benifits on paper (not just because a corp is potentially awesome). on the same token, playing in an npc corp restricts you from the 'bad things' of eve, such as wardecs. while you can still be suicide ganked, or ganked in lowsec or 0.0 you carry significantly less risk with you. i think you should pay for that risk. the 2 things i would do: 1) non pvp related npc corps are taxed 10%2) broker fees for players in npc corps are reduced 25% on top of skills.3) npc refining tax is reduced 0.25% on top of skills/standingsbut at the same time i would introduce personal hangers, which benifits all eve players giving us more organizational options. whatever the solution, it needs to be more carrot than stick. keep in mind that an npc corp tax on rat bounties will not affect real newbies. real newbies when they just join the game will be unable to kill the rats that draw such bounties. <- in a corp/alliance which does not openly recruit, so that \"you can't recruit card\" you guys keep playing is meaningless to me."
"i would be fine with this if it means npc corp players can set up pos and get corp hangar style hangars (only accessible for them)tldr: no."
"not all highsec corps care about setting up pos's. individual players for the most part do not care about setting up pos's."
"it seems to me that the idea of moving players out of noob npc corps is a good idea, given that the player is ready and they are not forced.but for me there is a major problem.members of the dev team see the current war dec system as a problem (it's flawed not fatally but don't put the crash cart away just yet ) and will be fixed sooner rather than later.as far as i'm aware no member of the dev team has sen the current npc corp situation as a problem (i'm willing to be corrected here plz).so by encouraging players out of npc corps now seems like putting the cart before the horse!see what the new system will achieve (when/if it arrives) and then after it's been around and it's effects felt, if there is still a need to encourage people to leave npc corps by all means do it.frankly the war dec system is a bigger problem currently than the npc corps and changing the staus quo now leads to the very real prospect of having to change all over again when the new war dec system comes in.edit: also hopefully the up and coming midas expansion will also have plenty of extra advantages for players to join player corps. midas will be an excellent opportunity bring in systems to benefit joint industrial efforts centered around player corps, but that might just be wishfull thinking."
"well, i guess it's the point of view. you see it like a punishement, but imho it's far from that. actually, for me it's a bonus reward for not participating in any multiplayer content that is availiable. this is not about punishment, this is about fairness! npc corps are an exception and not standard. there is no reason why they shouldn't pay taxes as everybody else.your benefits 1-4 have nothin to do with player corps. i play solo as well as i have a hard time finding the right corp/ally. but i have no problems at all to find players in local, help channel or whereever to do missioning together, escort or whatever. it's called fleet, you don't need a player corp for all those things."
"the message i get from your reply is: \"avoid this guy corp as evidently the ceo/directors keep all the tax for themselves and give nothing in return to the players. evidently you are getting nothing for your taxes so you feel that other players should suffer with you. benefits 1-4 have all to do with players corps as most of those things don't work or are more difficult to set up than when players are in npc corp.your \"fleet\" can't help you someone steal your wreck/can and you want to retaliate, don't has aggro on the attacker if someone attack you and so on. i suggest you learn how the aggro rules work before commenting. not having learned them in six months of play is dangerous.edit: spelling."
"oh come on making people pay for something they already had isn't punishment??????? so you reward people by making then pay for something they have always had. how nice .... and we'll ignore the hypocrisy of your following statementyes you have just said you'll reward everyone in an npc corp for the bonus reward of not participating in multiplayer content even though they probably are.my only problem with your proposal i listed above.but saying black is white and expecting us to be dumb enough to believe it i do have a problem with.have the decency to call what you want done what it is."

"this i can agree with, as it doesn't allow for accounts to auto-train while the user doesn't pay for the account. either this, or the auto-training doesn't occur when the account is disabled.by that logic, all ore should automatically transfer to your hauler, and missions should run themselves without you having to press a button. sorry, this doesn't make a shred of sense."
"the logic is a bit sketchy, i'll agree, but it's not as bad as you suggest. i'd draw a distinction between playing the game(mining, missioning, etc.) and doing support activities(setting skills, looking up item prices, etc.) - the former are things the player has to do themselves, the latter should be automated as much as possible. this is what i was trying to get at with \"the frustration is needless\", but i didn't really make my point very well."

"\"adding one reply packet to the end of the initial grid-loading data stream \"ypu are forgetting a little point from each ship. each ship need to acknowledge that you have been loaded or you will be invisible for some of them when you start firing. but at that time your \"single\" packet can be some hundred confirmations, all subject to lag and packet loss. and it will require to be redone every time a new ship load. care to guess how long it will take? i think several hours."
"no. that's not the right way to implement it at all.1.) your client sends a packet (or set of packets) at the end of a grid load. this confirms that you indeed have objects and other players loaded and in place on your grid (the objects and players that the server sent... ie, 'hey i'm rendering stuff, time to start the shooty-shooty' ).2.) the server logs the data and activates hostilities between yourself and other players.3.) profit? ($$$)we aren't looking for a perfect system where we make sure everyone is rendering everyone, we are looking for an imperfect system where we can determine 'this person was rendering something and sending instructions' or 'what was this person rendering at time of death, and could he send instructions?'. logs themselves could even be sent to a completely different log server (making any point about increased load moot from that perspective).you also have to remember that the server is most likely already sending and receiving lots and lots (and lots) of packets every second in such a situation. maybe you wouldn't have to do this type of checking in highsec, but in lowsec or 0.0 these appear to me to be a particularly important few packets that aren't being dealt with. this is more about proper implementation and design than which side lost what, tbh (if this happens to bob they should be reimbursed too, it is a sucky/frustrating way to lose ships). i see it as a design flaw that this could happen, rather than some sort of red vs. blue issue."
"morsus mihi loses a fleet fight and spams the forums and demands their ships back, god you guys look like huge whiners.the problem is not the reimbursement, the problem is that you are dying while staring at a black screen. if your enemy spent the fuel/strontium and ammo and killed a black-screened guy instead of someone who loaded then that they should get an insta kill button as reimbursement as well. your idea is just terrible.you should not be loaded and on-grid and shootable unless your client has loaded the screen. i'm no programmer but i don't see why something cannot be worked out.big yes to fixing dying to a black screen.big no to being pompous because your alliance died to a lag fight, do you think this is the first time someone lost a ship due to lag?"
"as much as we the playerbase like to inundate these forums with \"remove the lag\" posts, ccp has been taking steps to sort the lag problem. the desync problem is seperate. all i am asking is that while they put us through alpha and beta tests on their new systems, that they take accountability for their non-performance. this is not a question of bob, the northern coalition, or anyone else for that matter, nor do i presume to be in the first fleet to lose a battle to lag. this does not invalidate the point that the reimbursement policy when such non-performance does occur is poorly designed. this is not conspiratorial, we're not alleging any underhandedness in the matter, this is not partisan, this isn't about spiting one alliance or another. this is simply saying, telling people that their time is simply not worth even investigation or what essentially appears to be a macro response letter, much less fairly compensating a customer for a product's non-performance is a policy that should be changed. as for the whiner comment, i suggest you peruse the killboards from that battle for my loss i'm 'whining' about, or more specifically, the lack thereof."
"qftft! you're pretty handy with the hammer there mate... two thumbs fresh.ops got my support."

"get a job irl? this is the typical solution for most adults. u can earn the measily 15$ with 1 or 2 hours of labor in real life with any basic paying job. this is not something ccp should be wasting their time focused on. ccp doesn't make any money from you spending isk in game to buy the card. they sell the cards at a fixed price. its just an option out there for people making huge amounts of isk per day that can easily support this transaction. if your not up to par with what you make in game. real life money god forbid can solve this rather easily.ccp is trying to get the game to the point where its 90% player controlled economy if they intervene with this, it's going against their end ideas of being hands off. the market price will go back down if the majority consider the price above its true value. economics class would explain this better than i."

"i don't judge ideas based on the programming effort or bug fixing difficulty. i'm sure ccp knows how to handle those and wouldn't take on what they couldn't do. now i believe this idea has exactly 0 support from other players of this game so howabout we just let it go back to page 2 where you found it and i'm sure it will eventually make its way to the bottom. thx."
"i'm completely against it, because it only has significant drawbacks and no significant advantage.the number of people who would suffer from it would be multiple times the number of people who could possibly enjoy it.the effort to implement it would be huge and it would take massive resources away from much more interesting projects.it will scare of new players even more.and last but not least: it is very likely already in the game. seriously, what do you think isk really is? it is an exchange currency. there are hundreds of planets in eve and big political blocks that rarely agree much with each other. i think it is very likely that many worlds have their own local currencies. you only don't see them in game, because it would just mess everything up.\"great work with the mission! here you got 500.000 aunianian flongs.\"\"uhm... what can i do with those?\"\"just take a shuttle down to aunia. you can spend them there. in hotels, bars, holocinemas, bu shoes, candy, liquor... or you can convert them for a fee and at a rate of 3.16927 into sinq unit<U+FFFD>s. those can be traded for isk at a rate of...\"\"i hate you.\"by the way: it is a freakish assumption that isk would be standard in 0.0, while the empires would massively deviate. the other way around is much more likely. compare europe with africa. europe has the euro. africa has... lots of stuff. it is not the more or less chaotic small dominions that create unified currency. it is the powerblocks. so even if something like this was implemented, it would be the empire space that would use isk and the 0.0 factions who would give out their own currency. hello bob-dollar, goonswarm rupees, red rubels, gurista pesos..."
"you say that because you don't understand whats involved in programming such things.it's not as simple as a web page.... you need to keep in mind that with the current system now...with all of its bugs... you now have to impliment 4 additional currencies... track there values... track the markets for each currencies....track the exchange rates... track the ammounts of transactions...handle any disputes...handle any possible logging loads.if you can come up with a basis for tracking all of the above without telling me \"ccp can figure it out\"... be my guest.i'll warn you... i have experience in database systems.... its never as simple as it looks.yes... your idea is quite grandiose and clever..... but we have major issues that need working out.... we should focus on fixing what we got first.... as opposed to adding a whole new 3 to 4 separate sets of economies.in all honesty i think its obvious as to why each empire has an unified currency system.it's to keep it simple.hard enough to track an entire universe with multiple currencies.now if ccp already had an \"prototype\" for such a system.... no problem then.but right now.. i doubt it.good idea..... but not likely to be something in the near future."

"i see the role of the field cs as being gang mod and dps support platforms, as opposed to the fleet commands which are purely there for the gang mod. also, they must have bs-level tanks, being a valuable gang asset. the shield tanker field cs fit the \"gang mod and dps\" role strictly; the armour tankers have extra flexibility, being able to fit tackle or ewar as they so choose.currently, however, there are problems. the nighthawk is unable to fit a gang mod on a pvp setup because of hopelessly inadequate pg. it cannot be tanked particularly well - the active tank is awful, the buffer tank is not much better than that of a comparably-fit drake. this is partially a result of limited midslots and rigslots. you could either give the nh (and presumably sleip) an extra midslot to help their tank, but another tank bonus or simply extra shield hp and cap would also be useful.elsewhere, the astarte meets problems by having to drop a gun to fit a gang mod - this may or may not be balanced as far as the ship is concerned, but it confuses people and dissuades them from using the ship as intended. another problem is active-tanking itself - it's broken in pvp, buffer tanks and rr are superior in most circumstances, so the sleip and astarte really get the short end of the stick. change these to resist/hp bonuses, or fix active tanking by significantly increasing the overheat bonus on reppers/boosters, enabling an active tank to survive longer under focus fire.overall, either the field commands should have the fittings to fit their gang mods without any problems, or (more sensibly) they should have bonuses towards the fittings of the gang mod. they also need more tank. there's nothing wrong with the nh's dps potential, and it certainly doesn't need an extra launcher - the problem atm is that you can't fit the 3 bcs that you should be fitting because of crippling pg problems.really, the entire class needs to be brought up to date."
"so you are saying that shield 'tanking' commandships are a causality of the perceived tactical necessity to fit a mwd? or at least the nighthawk is?do you think if some of the previously mentioned speed changes (devblog) that were added to sisi were instituted on tranq, there would be a need to overall 8 ships?"
"well, the need to fit a mwd does hurt the shield tank. but since the mwd is the most powerful tank mod that you can fit, i don't have a problem with that. the sleip can have a very nice xlsb active tank - but it's horribly vulnerable to cap warfare. the nh can barely fit a msb. giving them another midslot may cause problems with excessive combat flexibility (t2 ham drake? not good for game balance, i think), so tweaking shield hp and cap size may be better.i expect mwds to still be essential on large ships. abs will be a specialist mod, used pretty much only on frigate-class ships, and mwds will often be preferred there anyway - it won't change anything for the nh/sleip's midslots/pg problems."
"all caldari ships have less pg than their counterparts, because they need less pg to fit their tanks.lse = 150 pg iirc800mm plate = 200 pgwith shield boosters the difference become even more apparent.x large shield booster = 500 pglarge armour repper = 2000 pg"
"passwords are not personal information; indeed they should never be even close to personal information.passwords are almost always kept as one-way hashes, and a good hash algorithm ensures that the likelihood of finding the password from the hash is low and that the chance of your password and someone else's computing to the same hash is small. sha-1, a popular hash algorithm, has been shown to be weaker in collisions than it was supposed to be, but there are plenty of longer hashes out there. this sets aside that collisions are not as relevant for password hashing; their importance is in digital signing. that said, keeping the current hashes secure is important, but only from the perspective of your individual account. you could in theory replay the hash in some way if you had access to it, but that's got nothing to do with previous ones being stored.changing passwords often is a good practice; however it's hard to do. utilities like keepass are ideal because they require you to remember only one hard-to-guess password, and keep your actual account passwords encrypted until you request them. my eve password is more than 15 alphanumerical random characters, and i change it every few months. i don't need to remember it though; i need to remember the decryption password for the utility database. there is of course an overhead in this; i have to have the keepass program handy to decrypt the password, but given that it's a few hundred kilobytes it fits easily on a usb stick. oh and obviously i back it up, lots.any methods that will obtain your keepass password would obtain your account passwords anyway (keyloggers for example) so the security risk in using such utilities is small to none, provided the utility itself is reasonably secure. security is never 100% secure, but you can make life difficult enough for an attacker that they go somewhere else.regardless, storage of previous password hashes is not a serious security risk."

"you'll never completely eliminate lag, not at our current technology level.the reason you see less of it in other games is they are not nearly as dynamic as eve. they have far less computations going on in any given combat. the only way you could eliminate lag given current tech constraints would be to dumb down the game so badly that no one would want to play it anymore (swg comes to mind)."

"as someone who takes part in the null-sec p.o.s. warfare putting someone's towers into reinforced does not kill them, you still have time to defend them and regroup. the amount of time the pos is in reinforced, also making strontium timing a important mechanic yes a smaller alliance might have to become pets for a while until they get strong enough to defend a part of space; of which there is still a lot unclaimed; but i see the current system as viable and working."
"limiting the population size of an alliance won't work.just because your game mechanics caps the limit... doesn't mean there aren't any \"unspoken\" alliances in game that could easily be achieved.but i do think there should be some bonuses give to the smaller guys.much like a graduated \"taxable\" income... the bigger you are... the more you pay or have to compensate for.otherwise these giants.... will never ever be challenged or stoppable.that makes it boring and there's little challenge let alone incentive to bother showing up or trying.short of joining them... which compounds the problem.don't get me wrong... i'm not saying that alliances the size of _______ (those who have more than a thousand members) or others is bad.i think its kinda awesome they could amass such a population.but they should have fewer advantages due to sheer size of population as a result of that fact.there numbers alone could make up for the bonuses smaller alliances get.just means they have to work harder.... which would be minuscule in comparison to the bulk of the corps out there who don't have that kind of benefit.in short... yeah... bigger alliances are awesome.... but they need to grant a bit of a handicap to the smaller folk so its not so easy to pull a blitzkrieg on them.never mind the sheer firepower.... the population alone would compensate for the shortfall!that's how these big giant alliances thrive... massive numbers to draw on pretty much take care of any big problems.stagnant \"empires\" of little to no change make for a dull game.keep it fresh.... mix it up a bit...."
"well renewable sources would be good, if they provided enough energy... and selling any excess to the national grid.however, the initial cost may be higher than the actual income, where expenses with this idea would surely go past. unless ccp are in a lot of profit, enough which to cover monthly costs, unforeseeable(s) and so forth, then its doubtful. energy suppliers might feed them the power from what they could claim to be coming from renewable sources, but that wouldn't be certain... as the power lines aren't exactly changing themselves to source from a different part. anyway, it wouldn't be business ethical if costs are in excess of current strategy."

"not sure if the issue was eventually brought up or not. but i agree this would bring rsd on the same level as ecm for those specialized ships, or at least give a larger bonus to the ships that are meant for rsd"
"you forgot that they also nerfed damp rigs (made my rapier cry)i do not fly arazu/lachs/celestis/etc but i support an increase to their bonus for rsds."
"agree 100% on this one."
"agreed: damps were overpowered and overused, but the gallante ew ships were pretty much fine. at a bare minumum the arazu, lachesis and keres should get an extra 5-7.5% damp strength per level, taking them to 10 or 12.5%. celestis should be 2.5% lower.additionally: add ew falloff rigs.edit: also, change signal distortion amps to boost all ew types, not just ecm."
"damps suck and need a boost.ecm got nerfed damp style before, but ecm spec ships got a big boost."
"signed. arazu/lachesis are pricey boats for being basically crap compared to other recons. command ship can make interceptor into mini arazu/lachesis (in sense of warp disruption at range), that is fail when you are pushed in that direction because of the cost of boats that are made to do it, and just dont well enough to be worth it."
"i would take this one step further though, pos's should not countrol systems, planets and colonies should. if you want to contest sov in a system you have to siege planets which halts production and gives the attacker anything left on the planet and in the orbiting array. also no reinforcement timers ****i have no idea what ccp were thinking when they decided to exclude planets from any particular use and then include pos warfare. i can't believe this wasnt in the game from the beginning."

"i suppose warping while cloaked and jamming at 200km isn't enough for ya, also you dont want anything to be able to counter your precious little ship effectively."
"i can't even fly a blackbird effectively, never mind a falcon. i just happen to think that eccm is fine - you use two slots, and turn the falcon from jamming 2 ships to jamming 2/3 of a ship. assuming he doesn't clue in and splits his jammers, you're essentially in the clear, and you can always overheat if you're having real trouble. now find me two slots that will counter a hac to that level of effectiveness."
"again, its not the fact that falcons can permajam 3 bs's or that eccm doesnt work or anything like that. the problem is that the falcon can operate at silly distances.you can deal with a rapier, curse, arazu and all the other recons without having to field a ship specifically fitted to counter them. you cant do that with a falcon. mostly because its too far away. i suggest that the falcons max operating range is put in line with the other recons. the ship should lose its jamming capability at 40km. you know it makes sense :p"
"yesterday i fiddled with an oneiros setup and racial jammers. even with pda/sda you could get half the jamming ability of a falcon.its quite apparent that falcons always should be primaried."
"wtf? you do realize that every t2 caldari cruiser is very capable of operating at 50 km - 100+ km (including the basilisk!); 3 out of 4 of the caldari t1 cruisers have similar operating ranges, the osprey being the only one not able to do so in its 'combat' role?no; the falcon (& rook) are very different from the other recons, do not have the punch or close range tools of other recons.can i agree to modifying the falcons bonuses again? yes. where you are seeing a falcon i think a rook is the intended ship for it.duh - the falcon (blackbird & rook) are designed to use jammers. the oneiros is designed to use remote armor repairers & targeting links. you are going to get less jamming ability of a griffin."
"still don't see why this is a problem for you. it takes a whole enemy ship - specifically fitted to target you - to reduce you to >50% effectiveness (discounting drones). sounds like those eccms are working pretty damb well to me. i'd be tearing my hear out if i was that falcon pilot and only getting 1 jam every other cycle on you. talk about frustrating."
"no. op is right, there's nuthin reasonable why npc corps should be free of tax. i would even go further and lay taxes on market sales as well, not only for npc. npc corps are a pain in the ass. every time i stumble upon suicide gankers, they are in npc corp. scout alts ... npc corps. macro miners ... npc corps. high sec xtreme mission farmers/alts ... npc corps.something should be done, and introducing a tax rate would give an incentive to players to decide what they wanna do. risk vs. reward, that simple."
"i agree with this one."
"this proposal to tax npc corp members seems like it will be making the game less fun for a large number of players because;a. it will be taking away resource (isk) from players who might actually like the community of an npc corp but not especially like smaller corp life.b. it won't be adding anything of benefit for them,c. they can 'game' the system by starting a 1 man corp as others in this thread have pointed out.please fix the wardec problem some other way (mandatory military service for a week every month for npc corp players with over x million sp or y months membership.. i.e. they can be attacked if the npc corp is war decced)."

"i think bombs would be absolutely fine the way they are if they changed one small thing, the fact that a bomb does not hit targets that entered the grid after they were launched. when a bomb detonates it should hit everything in its range, like a smartbomb detonation, not just the ones that have been there for the past 15 seconds. this way with the right timing the bomb becomes a very effective anti-blob tool, keep the price where its at and maybe increase the damage but first change the detonation mechanic."
"i believe dual training was already presented by csm to ccp."
"i support a look at artillery in general or the tempest specifically.artillery has long been the lower dps, lower range, lower tracking, but higher burst damage choice. this is a fine role. however, changes to base hp, rigs, and scripts have increased the range/tracking gap while reducing the effective burst damage (as a fraction of the target's total hp). others have noted how the hp increases and introduction of rigs affects artillery's burst damage. artillery are now worse compared to other long range turrets than they were, even though the stats have not changed, due to changes in mods, ships, and rigs. artillery should still be low dps, low range, low tracking, and high burst, but the disadvantages need to be reduced and the advantages increased to bring artillery back into line relative to the other long range turrets."
"i love alpha strike on arties.i support this idea."

"as you should probalble alreayd start you're csm campaing, i want to ask you about what you think of small gang pvp and its future? with the nano nerf, how do you think about the survival of this type of pvp? i life of small scale pvp and roaming and ****. but now the with the upcoming nano nerf it might actually really die in 0.0. now i dont mean small scale pvp within 5 jump radius. i mean roaming.as alliances get bigger and bigger with more and more advanced jump bridge networks, how do you think we are able to do w/o nanos? or are you just supporting 'blob yourself, too' approach, as many do. i want to hear what you think about this future. i have 2 votes to give and the one who has the best ideas and dedication to support my style of gameplay. disscus!"
"given that applications for the csm don't close for another week, and it'll probably be a week after that until the list of candidates goes live, i don't think many people are going to start campaigning until the middle of the month. there's only one candidate who has announced as of now. and you have until november 21 to vote, so there's no hurry on that either. your question is a good one, though a little bit wide-ranging for me to answer right now(i have to go out in half an hour). but if you want it to be a topic of debate for csm candidates, wait 2-3 weeks, until the race is actually on, and ask then."
"well, i'd happily have a large discussion about this. but the question here is extremely wide.first of all, the nano nerf, while it's long due, is a sign that something more wrong than nano is on. nano happens mostly due to the blobs going on. it's simple cause(blobs) and effect(nano).but small gang pvp has died tons of times at this point. having been a pirate ever since i started playing, small-gang warfare is still extremely viable. at this point, even without nano. you would be surprised how well a hac or two can pvp in the right areas.it's still beyond me why jump bridges had to be implemented. it's just as bad as nano's. it encourages blobbing.at this point, anti-blob weapons and things like that are an oxymoron. i honestly believe what needs to happen is that ccp needs to rework warfare so that small gangs are encouraged. we discussed how we could move something like the factional warfare system into 0.0, just much more advanced and multi-tiered. i think that's a solution. blobs will never die, nor should it be restricted. but people should benefit from having a smaller gang!"
"not running for csm, but have taken a large part in the discussions with a lot of parties on all ends and had the opportunity to look over what's been said from a lot of angles.i do believe there are some unhealthy things about 0.0 and that most of the start with the one-trick-pony pos solution. particular to the whole small-gang/blob argument is that there is no granularity. on the low end, we have solo players as targets. on the high end, we have towers as targets (arguably station services, but who really cares.)if an alliance chooses to escalate the scale of engagement, there is no dimmer switch. it's either on or off. you either work very small or very large. no targets lie between the two extremes. there's not much of a role for medium sized subcap gangs. once you go capital, you're committing and end up having to blob to try and avoid being rolled.the fight broker in 0.0 warfare basically boils down to the pos, and warfare at the pos is essentially a binary engagement mechanic.the binary nature is created by the time-zone balancing system that exists to protect alliances from getting \"3am blitzkrieged.\" pos timers effectively eliminate the potential for hit-and-run tactics. surprise suffers greatly.the solution i believe is to look at the current system, figure out what's working, and duplicate the working bits in between the extremes of pos and no pos.as a fight broker, pos's are functioning correctly. the stront timer mechanic does tell us when to meet and does keep time-zone from being a dominant or reliable mechanic.with regard to allowing more mobile and tactically interesting warfare, the solution is simply that the fight needs to exist on several grids simultaneously and with increasing returns for presence at the majority of those points.to add the granularity that the system currently lacks, implement new structures that derive their value from increasing the income of 0.0 and exist at a level smaller than the pos and with a smaller maximum reinforced timer. smaller timers, smaller rewards, smaller risks, and smaller defensive advantages. everything the pos is as a fight broker and an income instrament, but in a smaller bite that will attract action to medium sized gangs.in short, the solution will look like this: a multi-grid instrument of income that acts to add more granularity in targets, engagement sites, risk/reward, and fight-brokering.in addition, following on the philosophies i've been pushing forward in the acdc thread, i'd like to see these new structures implemented as auto-constructing with a much smaller initial investment and a focus on pvp success affording one the ability to field them rather than pveve grinding to come up with the fuel/bs/godforsaken-trip-to-empire required."
"after standing back and looking forward towards a future where no capsuleer is left behind () i find it necessary to point out a disconcerting characteristic of mmo's.first, are mmo's designed to bring out the inner adventurer or to attract the adventurous? in the latter case, one could argue that no mmo player is truly adventurous, having resorted to an online escape to satiate their needs. however, the key is that the content of mmo's is not otherwise sensible in the real world.second, who has the most to gain from the widespread proliferation of mmo's? while the immediate benefactor is ccp, blizzard etc, there is something much, much more sinister going on. millions of people who would, without the available source (mmo's), naturally discover new modes of life in the real world, are instead slave to the \"dumb terminals\" known as \"the client.\"ask yourself, who could possibly want to pour such a huge source of raw human potential into a sink such as an mmo? who has the most to gain from the added stability of keeping so much flow potential hidden in the singularity formed by mmo's and mmo players (eve and capsuleers)?the answer is world domination. in order to establish more predictable targets of control, it's necessary to remove or pre-occupy entities with a high propensity for discovering life outside the control structures. yes, overlord powers are seeking to assimilate the adventurous of the world and morph them into a more benign slobbering, dorito-munching catastrophe known collectively as \"nerds.\"mmo's are the work of **** cheney.companies such as ccp and blizzard have been established in order to attract adventurous elements of society and remove them from circulation, thus dropping the total value of the world so that the dollar will rise and the us can finance its way out of the massive debt crisis it's currently facing. it's been one giant plan all along.the key to the functioning of eve in this role is to ensure that capsuleers never fight other capsuleers directly. force them into roles where they must out-mine one another and fuel the most towers. if capsuleers ever came into contact on a regular basis, they would have fun, and this would reverse the flow of soul-destruction, leading to a new generation of capsuleers who were bright and cheery and liked hello kitty.this is the evil that must be stopped. eve is a massive computer system trying to download our souls. even ccp employees have been duped. it's all a giant conspiracy and the only way out of it is to make the game pure fun."
"these are my personal and rather uninformed ranting on a question i havent really though about a lot:i think that the problem is that a single defensive pos cannot effectively hurt a dreadfleet that is properly managed.what i would like to see is a situation where a cap fleet approaching an enemy death star defended by mulitple large guns is certain to take serious losses by those guns. this would in turn neccessitate using battleships to take out the large guns before exposing the dreads. battleships have a sig radius that should make them invulnerable to large guns but very vulnerable to medium guns.so a pos defended by both large and medium guns would require cruiser sized ships to engage to take out the medium guns before exposing the battleships to take out the large guns before exposing the dreads to take out the pos itself. in comes the small pos guns to deal with cruisers.frig sized hulls could then be brought to bear to take out the medium guns. and no pos guns should have a prayer of instapopping a frig - webbed, scrambled or not.combining this with making pos guns a lot more expensive than they are today and also making it take a looong time to online them (48 hours??) would make pos warfare require all sorts of ships being used in offensive actions.instead of having the cyno jammer outside the pos shields it should be placed inside making an attacking fleet need to take down the whole pos before jumping in the caps.combine this with making the onlining/offlining of cyno jammers take 48 hours or more the defenders will have to think seriously about where they want their caps and supercaps.all in all this should encourage a lot of fleet fights using smaller ships - at least thats the idea.i honesty though, i'm no fleet wizard and haven't got a clue what i'm talking about.i'm just sitting at work being rather bored..."

"i agree. considering it costs nothing to set up your own 1 man corp, the argument about \"not wanting the obligations of being in a player corp\" are bs. there's no real reason to be in an npc corp other than to avoid being war-dec'd. having to pay a tax for a benefit that those in player corps do not have, only seems fair.plus the game could use more isk sinks"

"sorry for being late to the thread, i am fairly new to the game.being in my first war i started looking around. the biggest problem is being the defender there is no way to end the war. the attacking corp in not active so i have not seen any targets to attack. the idea of the command center that someone proposed is a great idea. probably should require the size and toughness of the center be an option for the attacker. bigger and harder to destroy makes the war more expensive to start and maintain. i may mostly run an industrial corp but i am not anti-pvp. if i could end a war by going out and fighting over something, anything, you would see us doing more than sitting around doing our trading waiting for this to end.the current system encourages avoidance since most actions the defender takes cannot actually end the war. there needs to be risk on both sides. putting an object in space, that when destroyed ends the war seems like a great answer. the attacker gets to decide where and what, effectively dictating the terms but the attacker at least has an option to put an end to the conflict."

"please don't fool yourself folks. the csm was a response to a tad of bad publicity and shouldn't be confused as a empowered entity of substance in the cogs of the ccp machine.at best its a idea exchange ccp uses to funnel the inundation of both worthy and stupendously silly player game improvement suggestions so that they can devote less personnel to dealing with this facet of customer interaction.don't take it as a slam ccp, in fact it was a brilliant move from a marketing perspective, however utilizing a few more token suggested improvements would have made the program go over more with the masses.anyway, best of luck whoever wins, you have my sympathy and condolences. my only suggestion to whoever is elected is that they open up the transparency more to the masses that put them in office even if its just as silent observers at a online meeting or question and answer sessions on a reg basis and unedited transcripts in there entirety or something along those lines."
"it woudnt have been a bad idea to take the ten most called for player suggestions, held a vote on the forums to see which of those would be raised at the next csm meeting. many union branches use this method to raise transparency and ensure that they are a true representation of their members.ofc our merry lil band of corrupt council members would never have agreed to this."

"hi omber it's different in a couple of ways.100% of topics raised at csm meetings should come from the manner i proposed. this way it does not allow csm members to push their own biased subjects and agendas.also prior to any meeting the player base would be aware of the agenda's 5 key points and as such could fairly expect feedback on said points afterwards, with clear action points and accountabilities for such.as it stands right now, the csm can select at will which of the hundreds of subjects on these forums that they wish to talk about and ignore those they do not. invariably they have chosen subjects which further their own ends.further detailed feedback (as demonstrated above) has not been forthcoming from the amateurs currently within the csm. all we receive are edited minutes of their meetings, and a dev blog which has failed to list so much as 1 acheivment the csm has driven through.btw, im logging in more and more, so i'll see you in space zombie"

"who says it's overpriced ? what constitutes \"overpriced\" ?in 2 months, a decent inventor char can get close to 2 bil isk, a half-decent manufacturer can get over 1 bil isk, a 2 hours a workday and 10 hours per weekend l4 mission-runner can get over 3 bil isk, or a veldspar mining putting in the same amount of work can get over 1 bil isk.i'd call that underpriced.quit some accounts, or quit playing altogether. or just get a job and pay cash. problem solved."
"clearly they aren't expensive enough if people are still paying the price for this outdated, bugged, and generally not very good game.you have to remember that the price of gtcs is directly based on the willingness of the playerbase to convert dollars/euros/sheep into isk. with the world economy slowing, people are less willing to waste money on such silly things.certainly ccp could help out the playerbase with prices by actually banning farmer accounts instead of leaving them active so they can track the isk then remove it from idiot rmt'er accounts. that would result in less income for them though, so don't expect that."
"this isn't the first time i've seen this claim regarding fake orders and it isn't the first time i've seen no evidence presented to back it up. what exactly does a fake order look like?i doubt anyone is forcing you to run 4 accounts. perhaps you should consider consolidating your \"core\" characters onto one or two accounts during this lean period you're facing.exactly! say \"no\" to the dirty pinko scum! seriously though, i'm not opposed to the return of 30 & 90 day cards (or some variation of these) but i'm more inclined to think this is just a case of supply and demand being felt more and more by the \"whiny\" element in the community.i tend to feel a little smug about the whole thing now because the moment i heard about the changes i loaded my account up until next year while 90 day codes were still available and priced in the 300m to 350m range. in fact, when i got a little spare currency today, i turned that into a 60 day code and exchanged it for 485m within half an hour."

"the problemunder the current game mechanics, npc faction/corp standing is only obtainable in reliable quantities through missions. with factional warfare and cosmos, players can get limited amounts of standing, but the underlying principles of cosmos does not differ significantly from normal mission running, and factional warfare only offers a quite limited amount of faction standing, nor any corporation standing besides standing with the respective militias through the completion of objectives.personally, i don't like areas of the game being so limited to a certain playstyle. there is a large part of the playerbase that simply is not interested in mission-running, yet they require standing for other areas of the game such as setting up a pos or having access to datacores.the fixreliable standing gains should be obtainable through other means which are accessible to different playstyles.right. how?one mechanic would be through exploration mechanic that is already part of the game. pick up sos signal, rescue a sisters of eve vessel from the clutches of the blood raiders, and gain a bit of standing and loyalty points for your troubles. just an example, i'm sure people can be more creative than this. even better would be situations that offered players a choice as to which faction they want to assist: tip the balance for the serpentis or sansha (setup can be akin to infamous worlds collide mission, with two faction bases in a single deadspace pocket). as usual, the more dangerous the system, the better the rewards.another issue is that science/industrialist players are also unable to partake in missions. miners can at least get some mining missions (although they suck, i know), but there is no way to research or produce for some juicy standing. it would be nice if the npc factions would tax these players with the production of goods or a contribution to research. to prevent \"industrialists\" from buying goods off the market, an agent should instead provide an item which is then placed into an assembly array or lab, and produced or researched. this would take job slots as normal.pvp orientated players are also a group that is not very happy with the current situation and the solutions above does not answer their woes. for this type of player, i suggest a more open-ended system, where players can get bounties or standing boost through the elimination of players with high standing in an opposing faction. how to prevent people from selling themselves for kills or people shooting their alts i do not know, but possible avenues would be that a player can only provide standing once every x time, or that the standing gain is based on the amount of financial damage inflicted on the victim.thanks for reading, suggestions and discussion welcome!"
"by killing players with negative standings, or with high standings to opposed factions.edit: diminishing returns for killing the same player. eg: gallante gives a relatively large standing boost to the next guy that pods me, a 50% smaller one next time, etc.or: balance it with faction hits as well as boosts. anyone who kills me gets a boost to gallente, but a loss to caldari."
"if it is made easier to manipulate standings they should matter a bit more and be more interrelated.also there is the ever present 'issue' of recovering from negative standing and the lack of tools to do so.possible ways to include standings.npc buy orders for things pod pilots make/acquire at varying % / isk & volume. the danger of course is it will put a min buy on those products as no one would sell for less than the npcs will buy it. but lets argue for the moment that they will have buy orders for the base value of minerals (they need those). so when you sell the caldari navy 1m units of trit you get a 0.1% increase in standing with the caldari navy. alternatively they npc corps could issue contracts for these goods.research & industry agents providing missions similar to the starter missions! in the tutorial mission arch the tree contains a mission where you are given a bp & told \"make this for us\", more of these; possibly including what are currently npc goods would be help there i think.i am sure there are other options, just some ideas."
"that is the most important part that needs adressing, the pos is a industialists tool and there should be a way without mission grinding that gets you the standings to be able to hang a pos, all you are doing by not changing this is giving another easy another income stream to missioner's who already got a isk printing machine by doing lvl 4's. have heard the same thing mentioned a few times on the forum's but never really seen a decent fix for this come forward, certainly there should be a way which means industrials can get these standings without either hireing a missioner to fix there standings or doing missions themselves but still something that takes a similar about to time and trouble. btw i'm a missioner who has done corp fixing job's in past so it's not sour grapes on my part."
"how about gaining small faction increases for buying and selling in the market? the rationale here being that the better the market, the better the faction's economy is, and that is better fort the faction. not sure if it would be possible to prevent abuse of that by having two people buying & selling the same expensive things backwards and forwards to push up their standings... but if the increase is small, that agent commission will start to add up i guess!i do like the idea of selling goods to npc corps - particularly if that moves over to fw as well. i don't enjoy pvp but i really like faction-building... i would like to be able to support my chosen militia in logistical or supply terms rather than going all out pew pew - after all real armies very quickly learn the importance of good supply and support or they don't achieve very much."
"certainly the war efforts of the various empires need supporting, especially in the form of missions to produce equipment for the war effort .... at higher lvl missions ammo and weapons, at lower levels they could be given specific bpc's for components (like the fictious ore types in mining missions).and yes outside of the fw system, there should be some standings bounty available to players outside of missions.at the end of the day even with vast empires as your dealing with here, most of the populations efforts would go towards the war effort, beyond simply shooting things that is."

"shouldn't defence be up to the holders of the system to provide rather than let some automated npc mechanic do it for you?heck, why not just have sov 4 give you npc roaming enforcers who concordokken annyone they find if they belong to the wrong alliance?"
"good, its 1 less of last years corrupt council members who can retain his position."
"would imagine that he is one of the few that have got their brains in most of the time tbh. most others not let their lack of knoweldge in certain areas stop them from spouting crap about it and only one or two can be seen to have a proper discussion and thinks about the matter in hand instead of just saying the same things over and over in the belief that the more words you write the more people will think you great. one of the others i think people have respect for is the goon dude, he has on the whole represented his side of the game well and has rational thoughts and tries to see each side of debate."
"appreciate your answers. i know my q was quite large. for vista this was about 0.0. i know you can pvp q/o nanos in small gangs in lowsec. not in 0.0. you simply cant go much further down the pipe that 2-3 jumps from empire, you'll get titanized most likely or blobbed like *****. ofc atm its possible in the south, because bob isnt home but when they come this are goes down the drain.and for the other answer: this wasnt for the guys who want to take pos down. this was about getting fights, trying to make living of pvp and generally ganking peeps in 0.0. i dont care much for sov anyways."
"now considering before the csm; things changed when people whined enough.this is the same even today.so what has the csm actually done? i posit nothing.what is the csm actually about? or around to do?before if people whined... but ccp wasnt going to change it... ccp was essentially saying no to those players. thusly ccp looks bad.now people whine. some 12 year old people argue with eachother and vote to say yes or no then pass it on. this essentially filters out loads of the nos. then finally when ccp doesnt change it; it's the csm who said no and not the csm. thusly ccp looks like they are the neutral or good guys.now i would like someone to prove me wrong. what has changed because of the csm that ccp wouldnt change normally?"
"the csm allows for the voice of many to be voiced through few. it's a poll like system that is bring many changes into the next expansion.it allows for ccp to hear what the players want and to give feedback on all the ideas that have a lot of community support.it also gives the players a real path of action if a dev is caught cheating again.now now i know, everyone has their own way of posting or voting blah blah, but overall this sort of thing is needed as the playerbase inceases.it worked really well in jumpgate 3 years ago it's not doing too bad now.however it's very very rusty and needs work to smooth it out, however i hope to see it become a feature of eve that lasts forever."
"a lot of things are still in the development pipeline (black ops boosts for example).what i've personally achieved that is actually in the game now?* suicide ganking rebalance* factional warfare mission difficulty rebalancewhat is in the pipeline?* drone implants* hopefully the return of the 30 day gtcthings currently in discussion...* drone behaviour fixes* small anchorable structures* more crossfaction ships what will help out eve in the long run?* contributions to industrialist expansion* mission review"
"you personally? as if you were the csm all by your glorious self. proofs to me that this is nothing more but a theater for bloated egos."
"just read what you want to read, abrazzar.at least i know i'm not spending a lot of time every week polishing my ego."
"omg you don't honestly think that you personally did that did you ? apart from that insight into you're greatness that did or will not come about because of the csm, it was being talked about before and a re-balance was on the way weather you like to admit it or not. the other thing in the pipeline you mention are not what the csm will achieve but other's, they will come up with the idea's that will be acted upon and as always others ( just like you did re the suicide gank thing ) will claim credit. sure some idea's will emerge from csm's esp with the industry fix but i bet more stupid idea's will come forward from people who are not really industrialists but think cause they are carebears they got to speak on every subject non pvp around. i personally feel the jury still out on the csm and it could be good, just ego's and petty politic's and are getting in the way and not neccessarily from the ones you'd think."
"you mean as opposed to the pvp players & pirates who think they have to speak on every carebear subject around?everyone has an opinion which they are entitled to share - it may be more, or less informed than other people's, and it may be different to your own, but it's still a valid opinion.my opinion on those who constantly dis the csm is that they fail to realise that the csm can only function if the players get behind it. anyone purposefully trying to hinder the process or drag it down seems to be failing to understand that the point of the exercise is to improve eve for everyone. if you look at the voting records, all of the delegates have voted for things that have a personally detrimental effect but which are better for eve as a whole, or not voted for things that would have had a detrimental effect if they had gone through.it is clear that others have different opinions, but i say to them that if they don't think that the csm works, please feel free to propose an alternate method to filter the signal from the noise of thousands of forum posts every day, so that ccp don't accidentally listen to the whinings of a vocal minority and implement something that is great for 5% of the player base but bad for the other 95%.i for one am glad to have this vehicle, and quite impressed that ccp have tried to give players a voice. i think they could have implemented it better, and supported it better, but it's a lot better than having nothing there at all.it is difficult to say what the csm has achieved this early on. many of the proposed changes require considerable development and testing time and will not come to fruition in this, or even the next, incarnation of the csm. there is something on the table that when a change is patched that has happened as a direct result of the csm, that it is highlighted as such, as this will help everyone see that the csm actually works, and improve public confidence in the mechanism."
"trolling is cheap and easy.standing up for what you believe in and trying to get things changed takes guts.bet you won't be putting yourself forward as a candidate."
"while english not native lauguage i thought i said that just cause someone a carebear not mean they got any knowledge of industry and their idea's may not be good ones, , nothing about pvp'ers thinking they industrialists or industrialist saying about pvp aspects. seen a lot of csm members just say a idea is silly or stupid etc if disagree with it and seem to think that thier title will be ok and they not need a rational counter to it."
"didn't like their opinions or attitude ... don't vote for them next time or vote for someone who better represents your opinion ... or even better stand for election.didn't challenge their stupid opinions when you had a chance .... not their fault, it's yours.couldn't challenge their stupid opinons, get elected and change things so people can't."
"why is it \"slam the csm\" week?i mean seriously... do you people love to just kick dirt in everyone's face.it's bad enough all the pirates and gankers yell carebear at there own shadows....now we got a ton of whiners and morons who completely throw rationality out the window for the sake of breaking the window.did you all forget that the csm has the unique ability of directly interfacing with ccp?think about it... out of 30 thousand some odd gamers who all have there own little pet peeves and a very small number of them get the chance thanks to this csm system to voice those thoughts and opinion's.like i ranted about in a previous topic... there is no such thing as a democracy... there's always some damn bunch of idiots who think they know it all and grind an axe as soon as you make a mistake or ignore them.and here you are trying to burn that bridge.... you honestly think it would improve the situation even after the fact?yes... people make mistakes... people screw up... people are selfish.. welcome to the human race.so in short... stop throwing a fit and get off your lazy @$$ and do something about it.like running for the csm.i swear... must you people throw your brains out the door every whim and chance you get?i support csm for the fact that the communications pipeline.... granted narrow and not entirely clear.... is the only way to get things done and fixed in the world of eve without having give into the mass rioting and screaming mob mentality. that's why its there and it makes ccp's job easier.ccp may not be perfect... but its certainly better than most gaming administrations i've met in the time i've been gaming for... and its been a very very long time since i started playing online.with all due respect... if your going to throw a fit.... stfu... or gtfo.because all your doing is wasting our valuable time and looking like an idiot.screaming and complaining only slows the process down or makes it worse.and while i feel like im contradicting myself in saying that... at least i'm \"complaining\" at the complainers.so how about coming up with a solution as opposed to starting a flamewar.oh wow... what a great idea drake...well duh!ps: as for what changed? i can see a lot has changed... your just too jaded to even notice. it's called progress.... small yes.... not as grandiose as some would like it.. but it is progress."
"having had insight from within on the csm (serving as an alternate) i can say without hesitation that the csm has made a difference. ccp listen to player concerns and issues/proposals, and use this information to inform and plan future developments/expansions. there is invariably a lag phase between issues reaching ccp and their implementation, which is to be expected when development/balancing etc is involved.i'm running for the csm because i believe players need such a route to have their voices heard, and its imperative that the csm interact and listen to the player base at large on issues. having just finished with a ccp meeting (records posted hopefully next week), i am feeling very positive on the future of the csm and the importance given to it by ccp!take care,bruce hansen (arithron)"
"mothermoon recites democracy's talking point. ya thanks for coming by.the devs admitted before black ops went live that they pre-nerfed it and they plan to boost it in the future. obviously the csm has absolutely nothing to do with that.so you are part of this csm? interesting. though just glancing at your post it is very respectable of a post. so i give you props.suicide ganking whining existed long before the csm. i'll keep this one neutral.i was on sisi for fail warfare testing. i put in my many cents. which got many dev responses. up until i got podkilled a couple times and lost all my sp. dont think csm really has much to say for this.chribba and myself; i know have multiple threads which were before the csm and had devs saying that they are looking into it, but not any time soon. perhaps it is coming up now... i'd say that one is given to chribba.this one would truly be a real csm victory. considering how much whining is happening and nothing is being done. csm would get credit. then again if you notice... you use the word hopefully. yes well you notice how you have no sway over what ccp is going to do.there are some good and funny little flash videos showing this. honestly though... that recent change really made it good. yes sometimes drones do what they are told too and instead shoot what their autotarget is; or they split into 2 groups. this is far from what was happening before.i posted this idea which split off into a much larger discussion and eventually got linked into the sticky in features forum. csm really isnt doing much here. and finally we comment on the whole...things currently in discussion...these arent changes.now lets discuss how many ideas have been shot down by the csm and not ccp. i bet there's a load of them.this kind of proves my point csm achieves nothing. good in theory... not practical. ccp is a company who do what they do. they likely even have rough plans of what each expansion will be about in the next couple years.ps: where i say i posted the idea. it just is to elaborate how me and about 20,000 other people have also posted the ideas."
"how much money are these people making for their time? i suspect it's closer to 0... which last i checked was slavery. sorry i'm not a slave. i can however post my ideas here and there and ccp will likely read them.because i've been bothered to read about how the csm's term is up and how an age limit is being imposed and such. the csm is getting attention because of that... the csm's record is also up and available and a batting record of 0 is pretty bad.isnt there a podcast people who talk with greyscale all the time? that's direct interfacing. oh and recall... devs post in the forums... they at least read them. meaning thats direct interfacing as well. csm has nothing special.burn what bridge? there clearly is no discourse. they seemingly say nothing to the devs; because nothing changes."
"so you admit bias and then make a statement. hah.yes well before the csm existed... people did exactly the same thing... make threads with hundreds of responses and then change happens. that's how it happens still. then again im still waiting for the nano nerfs take 3. csm has nothing to do with this.yep we propose stuff 2 years ago and it gets implemented now. csm then pretends to take credit. here's how it actually works. either goto features or game development. make thread... \"nerf titan dd\" get 50 friends to post in there to say how the dd needs to be nerfed and what changes could be to be reasonable. then because of popularity of thread in there... loads of other people show up to say something also. then eventually change happens. then we get 1 hour cooldown.that's how change happens."
"wow! okay first post, basically your argument is that csm have gotten nothing done in 6 months, where as 20,000 people whining for a couple of years have achived loads of stuff .....except that all the examples of things they have achieved havn't happen yet, and are about to happen. in other words it took over 2 years plus to achieve anything.then you have the cheek to say that the csm are useless cause they have achieved 'nothing' in 6 months.you need to buy a dictionary and look up the word hypocrit.slavery, yep last time i checked the dictionary volunteer is another definition of slave .... oh wait just rechecked and you have completely misunderstood what a volunteer is. let me help you what it isn't is a trollyou expect them to have done so much in 6 months and yet you havn't got the guts to try and do 1/10 as much as they have. you are however willing to take the glory for what other people have achieved, just because you replied to a couple of threads on the forums.one of the main blocks to communication between the player base and the ccp are the forums where people like you, elitist clichy forum warriors, who make the forums so unwelcoming to anyone outside your narrow group of friends or outside your narrow minded point of view.remember the old saying ... if your not part of the solution your part of the problem ... guess what."
"actualy jason what you are refering to used to be called flaming..and with the csm it is now a much more orderly discusion..things dont just get spammed they get discussed and in a lot of cases acted upon.."
"if they supposedly can do so much... they should have at least gotten 1 thing changed.whiners get stuff changed more often then the csm apparently.actually all my examples are quite live events. a titan cant fire its dd as long as it has enough cap.erm. i was born with 2 cheeks. so yes i have \"cheek\". yes well the record is evident that things change due to whiners within 6months or less. these whiners arent in some csm deal that speaks directly to the devs.yes well i would be a hypocrit if things didnt change. but they do because of whiners.as we established using the points that a csm member put out. the csm did nothing. so 1/10 of nothing is still nothing. infact i've done 10^109574636 times more then them. which is still nothing. at least according to you. i have on the otherhand been on sisi doing things and bug reporting. etc etc. that's something. meaning i really have done more then the csm. though i will admit... the csm members most likely also contribute also.i never took credit. i just put it in that light because it fits. tons of other whiners with me also get credit.you only a few sentences were calling me a troll... yet i think i am at least bringing something to the table. valid examples and arguments. you on the otherhand want to throw around these ad homninems. i do believe i have been rather cordial.you are certainly strong with the fallacious arguments."
"i'd also like to point out that this doesnt count for private communications. such as private channels. you can pretty much say what you want when you want. if anyone doesnt like it... they can block you.being vulgar or offensive in local channel though is inappropriate."
"where can i find the minutes from these csm meetings, there seems to be allot of meetings but nothing actually coming out the other end!thanks-cj"
"come on ccp - stop hiding, and come out and tell us when this is going to be done. and, csm, seems that lvv is the only one who actually keeps us updated... where the hell are you? come out and tell us why in the world you have not pushed this with ccp hard enough? i mean, come on, other issues made, and were heard about and this thing has ben just hanging here. i do not think this is the best way for you guys to appear in the upcoming elections...."
"barrage affects gun tracking. as i stated before ammo that affects the gun only affects that gun and no other, so you only get one incidence of the penalty for that weapon.hail affects your cap regen, so each weapon penalizes the ship as a whole. the penalties stack, reducing your capacitor regeneration to effectively nil while using hail.if they do nothing more they should look at this unbalanced disparity that renders certain t2 ammos downright dangerous to attempt using (missiles most notably), and considerably less useful than their base t1 counterparts, much less faction."
"one skill \"train all\"this would make things easier and more fun."
"while i also would like the bo to get a boost to their combat abilities i think people are taking this too seriously.remember, many items (boats, cars, planes, cell phones, computers, ect...) are rushed to market before they are ready for release.also remember that many are released with poor design and functionality.i speak from experience in that many pieces of equipment at my work are released after being designed by engineers yet no actual field personal being involved and they fail miserably.it happens.now, i would like to see ccp improve the bo but release it from a different manufacturer with different features. this would be more realistic.but just cause the first release sucks (and dont get me wrong, it does truly suck) does not mean that it is the end of the world. as in the real world, sales would slump and plummet until a rework of the ship or a different company released a model with different attributes.but just remember that it just might turn into a covert hauler type role rather then the role that most of the community would prefer. the af is a good example as are afterburners. both have limited uses and both are not popular in many pvp situations.it happens.if ccp would release a design model that allowed players to exchange features on a ship to create truly unique craft so we could redesign it ourselves then that would be a leap in not only the pvp side but the manufacturing and research areas of the game.till then we just have to realise that ccp might just write the bo off as a failed ship release and move on to more important game issues like lag, war dec mechanics, the sovereignty rules, adding more systems, or many other more critical areas of eve that really do have a larger impact then fixing the bo.dont get me wrong, i would love to see a tier 2 ship based on the domi. its just that honestly it is not as important to the enjoyment of eve by the majority of the playerbase. it is a ship for players who have been here a while.anyway, just my 3 isk..."
"alot of people like to point to the jump bridging ability of the blackop as the defining charateristic of this and it'd intended implementation . imho i feel this is completely ridiculous . why would someone train the supportand required skills for a ship that use is sending other ships into combat. what fun is there in simply standing on the pier waving while oters go to war ? well it does have a combat ability ... well no it doesn't beacuse they are inferior to their t-1 cousins in combat . so what do you get for your considerable isk and time investment ...1 a battle ship that has traded combat ability for jump drive ability which is rendered useless by game mechanics involving sovereignity and cynojammers2 a battle ship that has a very limited jump bridging ability which is further limited by the issues in 13 a battle ship that in the end cannot compete directly with it's t-1 couterpart in use vs expense - in dps ( cept widow ) - and in overall survivability .now look at tech2 ships in generalcompare a recon to it's t-1 variant which is the better ship?compare a hac to it's t-1 variant which is the better ship?command shipslogistics ceptors.....each of these classes has abilities far in excess of their t-1 variant hence their use despite the cost . now i have posted b4 with diferent ideas on what could be improved but simply even in it's current state if jumping into cyno jammed systems and covert ops cloaks were alowed i could forgive the loss of dammage and cost ."
"the meeting was 3 months ago....is tux on this?are there any plans to un-nerf black ops?will there ever be?"
"signed/ i support any direction that bring the black ops into line as a useful ship type for behind enemy lines hit and run engagements in small gangs of coverts, recons and stealth bombers."
"just have the stupid contract system completely ignore 'charges' entirely. voila, vixed, and you still can't contract a ship with 5% hull."

"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.smartbombs have long been a neglected weapon system in eve online. available and functional at release - they've stayed more or less consistent ever since. we've had faction variants of course, tech2 variants and some mechanics involving smartbombs have changed but we are still lacking support skills for these devices to allow people to specialize (as they have in drones, missiles, ew etc etc) and we're missing capital ship sized smartbombs to put on our carriers, dreadnaughts, motherships and titans. if this [issue] is supported and passes the csm i'd like to ask ccp to make time in the next available development cycle to do a general refresh/revamp/rebalance of all things smartbomb and bring this system back into the mainstream of eve combat. this would involve (but not be limited too): introducing skills for specializing in smartbombs smartbomb range. smartbomb damage. smartbomb energy use reduction.smartbomb rapid refire. etc etc.introducing rigs and implants to boost smartbombspretty much taking a leaf from the book of current missile/drone rigs/implants.introducing capital sized smartbombstech1, tech2, officer grade perhaps.balancing and platform interactionparticularly important for things like the unreasonable vulnerability of citadel torpedoes to current smartbombs. its important that enhanced current and potential newcap class smartbombs aren't ludicrously effective against missiles and drones and such. random scripting musinghow about giving smartbombs a scripted mode switch \"indiscriminate/selective\" - maybe allow indiscriminate mode to function as is (as in everyone in range takes the hit) - good for lowsec/0.0 work or selective mode where they do half damage but only hit war enemies / criminally flagged people perhaps?obvious questionsq. but won't this mean pirates would camp lowsec gates with capital class smartbombing motherships again? a. i'm not sure thats such a bad thing ... seriously, aggression flagged motherships at gates in lowsec? sounds like pvp opportunity to me. q. won't smartbombs become overpowered against missile/drone users?a. its a fair question and i think we'd have to take the example of the missile weaponry overhaul. missile weapons became underpowered with inferior skills, about the same on levels 2-3 on the support skills and slightly better at high levels of specialization. i don't think thats unreasonable. if a player wants to become expert in smartbombs and put a lot of their training points in that objective then i think its a good thing to let them perform better than an unskilled smartbomb user. if you were trying to counter drone/missile spam it makes sense to go with smartbombs. q. why are you promoting this just now - has sf got some uber plan to take over fw with smartbombing typhoons you fiendish political manipulator you! a. i promised to raise the smartbomb issue during my csm election campaign and i honestly think its a under-supported weapon system that could do with the skills to specialize and the provision of capital ship sized smartbombs for cap on cap mayhem. with proper balancing and development i think its a good addition to the eve combat cannon and will provide some additional fitting options/complexity for the pvp game.conclusionlets have re-working of smartbombs advocated to ccp's development agenda for next year and bring this weapon system into support equality with guns/missiles/drones/ew for increased variety and potential in the eve combat system. ccp have teams of developers that can do the brainstorming and balance work if we let them know we care about this issue. lets put it on the agenda."
"and +1 support because it'd be rude not too."
"smartbombs are very narrow weapon systems at present, but i'm not really convinced that they're bad per se. if you have a ship that you want to defend from drones, they are very good, because it multiplies their effective damage immensely, which is why most supercapitals use them. if you need to do damage instantly, without a targeting delay, they're your only means to do so, which gives them some utility if you're trying to collect a pod. they also have some utility as missile defence, but that's mostly because of a very odd interaction with the rules for defender missiles, to my knowledge. ultimately, i like the thrust of your proposal, and i think that a couple of those skills ought to be added(though i'm surprised that you request a rapid-fire skill, given that that's what energy pulse weapons does), but i'm not sure that smartbombs can be made good without just becoming ludicrous. for example, if commonly available smartbombs can go above 20 km or so in range, they will virtually eliminate nano ships, interceptors, and small ships generally, from being plausible in combat. and that still wouldn't make them usable in highsec, because highsec combat happens close to gates and stations, which concord doesn't like you bombing. one alternate proposal comes to mind - make several scripts for smartbombs, to fulfill their various roles. have one that shrinks the range to 1-2 km and drops the cap usage, to allow you to clean out drones in highsec without blowing anything up if you're careful. have one that increases the range dramatically, but put an explosion speed/radius on it like a missile, for mission work. have a script that limits it to a 180 degree spread, so that your buddies can stand behind you safely without explicitly coding in iff mechanisms. if the anti-missile role is one you want to encourage, have a script that increases range, increases rof, and decreases dps. perhaps even have a script that increases range and damage dramatically, to somethign near the range of a bomb, but that burns out the module in a single shot, for blob-smashing. this would be a bit of a mess, but something along these lines might be workable."
"i like the idea of scripting these for multiple uses. would add a little \"smart\" to my bombs. :)"
"actually, since ccp has indicated that details and specifics aren't required (they'll do the hard graft part!), simplify the issue to:we think smartbombs could do with some loving! (and here's a couple examples).being a drone user myself, i can see the drawbacks of making them more popular! however, i like them and would like to see them more usable with covert ops and black ops....take care,arithron"
"i am happy with skills to spec smartbombs. i'm less sure about capitals - as far as i'm concerned, smartbombs are already a hugely popular and powerful weapon on e.g. a carrier or a mothership. i mean, it's not like we already have named/officer capital mods."
"make smart-bombs smart? what nonsense you speak!p.s. supported"
"i like the idea, number of things i would like to vote down :)"
"a thumbs up for thumbs down!"
"a thumbs up for a thumbs up for a thumbs down!"
"signed/ let the mass vote ya or na"
"i agree with this topic"
"i'm a big fan of logistics so i very much support the concept. although i think having a ship with shield transport and cap transfer and only having 2 highs isn't very effective, likely need a 3 high. not to mention have you reviewed cpu/pg use on logistics stuff?"
"sorry, i've been away for the weekend... (n = guns, y = volleys, r = reloads a = ammunition types)now:you fire n*y times checking n*y times for ammunition and then reload r*n times checking r*n times for ammunition in the cargo bay.after:you fire n singles guns y times checking a times for how long the ammunition will last.this isn't really about firing guns, it is about moving/calculating ammunition objects. when you count in all of the extra calculations/queries/movements that we could completely axe, it does become exponential.it will check once, however. from a programming point of view, given the amount that we have reduced the complexity already, we could make our single check able to handle that.not a hazy area at all. different guns have different rates of fire, and we calculate based on type of ammunition. at most you have 8 calculations at the beginning of firing (one for each gun). this would be a worst case scenario. given that most people do not load 8 different types of ammunition, we can guess that the improvement in performance will be much better."
"got my vote"
"an age limit of 18 is necessary because it's probably not feasible to have minors travelling abroad alone for csm meetings and such...too many potential issues that could crop up with laws, etc.an age limit of 21 is just stupid, unnecessary, and based only in the stereotype that people who aren't 21 are dip****s. lvv proves that false pretty well."
"21 is the legal drinking age in some of the most drinking stringent countries, which means we will have more drunk csms.i would support 18+ but 21+ is a little much, i mean i am 18 and i like to believe i am capable of some coherent thought."
"nerf supported."
"by by nano .....have a nice trip, see you next fall"
"this."
"i said this before in another similiar thread..having a tax for npc corps is pointless..first off if you force npc corp players to pay taxes then you have to make player owned corps do the same..ie they must have a minimum tax= to the npc tax..second to be taxed for a singular benefit as you call it is worthless as well.it will not discourage those big fat isk makers from leaving the npc corp and it will put newer players at risk as well..picture if you will the noob who has less than a million isk and finds him/herself paying more tax than they can make to buy skill books supplies etc..all this so a few more experienced players can have target practice?? bah there are much better ways of expending your energies than finding new ways to disadvantage newer players."
"i'm sure i'll need a flame resistant suit for this, however it's a pretty simply issue;if csms are banned from the forums or banned from eve, they should be removed from the csm immediately., gives the csm members the right to vote on whether the banned csm member is kicked from the csm. one vote may be taken per forum banning. this should be the case for both temporary and permanent bans. the issue i can see with this is that it provides ccp with a mechanism for removing csm members, so it would need to be documented that the person in question has received warnings first, and notified to the whole csm that this is occuring.on the other hand - do you really want someone who gets banned representing you?note: the situation of what happens when a csm member gets removed is already dealt with: an alternate is raised up in their place, in order of max votes receivedvote!edit: revised based on feedback: text removed text added"
"i thought this was the case already. of course, this has to be done."
"you need both forums and game to interact with the csm now that we have the csm forum, and a csm member who is banned on one of those (or both) channels will not be able to function in the csm anymore.it would make sense to remove them from the csm, especially when it concerns permanent bans."
"makes sense to me. at the minimum an elected csm delegate needs to be able to keep to the basic rules of conduct on the forums and in game so they can set an example to the playerbase."
"support this initiative..."
"isn't this already the case? i thought that if someone got banned from the game, they got booted from the csm. if ythey don't, then i would support changing that. and i don't think that a forum ban is necessarily ejection-worthy - it certainly shouldn't be automatic."
"considering ccp's occasional trigger-happy approach to bans, this has pretty impressive potential for abuse."
"it's clear from the documents that csm members are expected to follow high standards of behaviour at all times. getting oneself forum-banned should be enough to get oneself removed from the csm, as it's pretty hard to discuss and interact in jita hall etc without the ability to post! i'd also suggest that the actions that resulted in the forum-banning probably don't reflect well on the csm. all organisations have the 'bring into disrepute' clause for removal from office (i'd lose my job!).take care,arithron"
"given that you cannot apply to be on the csm if you have had a ban in the past, that seems not unreasonable."
"not supported. first, ccp has already demonstrated unwillingness to get involved on that level of the csm. second, forum mods should not have that kind of power over the csm.oh and third, the potential for abuse of in game petition system and the like wasting time of ccp employees is immense."
"in the process of changing my signature, i've come across another text length limit - sigs are limited to like 200 characters, which effectively means you can't have more than one link in it. there should be limits on sig size, in the sense of making sure that they don't dominate a page when you're reading them, but you should be able to put in a bunch of links if you want to."
"it's important to make the distinction between character limits on in-game mechanisms, and out-of-game ones. out of game, the limit could be relaxed, although as others quite rightly point out some players will ramble on and on and on...in-game, the limit is there to prevent exploits. ccp are pretty clear about this and are looking at alternate ways of fixing it (for some future point). mail is getting a revamp, so expect some fixing there (i'm hoping for a 'sent items' folder option!).it's a shame that players choose to exploit such innocuous looking areas of the game system, i'll live with the character limit rather than the consequences of exploitation any day though!for a fuller update, read the latest csm/ccp notes when released later in the week.take care,arithron"
"this is just an idea, its based on the current ingame mechanics. at the moment you can buy shares from corps, and get a reasonable return based on the isk you put into it, this we all know, but it is easy to get scammed.my suggestion is to have npc version of this feature. your character continues to grow and gain skills while your afk, at work or simply taking a break for a few days. why not have the option to utilize your isk in this way?say for instance if i wanted to buy 100 interbus shares, as a result i get x amount of isk per share per day/hour for my investment.understandably this would have an effect on players curently trying to sell thier corp shares, if everybody was to invest in npc's, the smaller starup crops would suffer.this could be combated by making the npc shares less appealing. i spend 1 million isk on 1 share, which generates me approx 1% of my investment per hour for my troubles. so for spending 1 million isk, i get 1000 isk an hour. you could limit the amount of shares one could hold per corp, and you could increase the amount of isk generated based on standing with the corp, kind of like level agents. buying 1000 shares from a level 1 npc agent would only generate you a small amount of isk, but buying 1000 shares from a level 4 agent would be more expensive, but ultimaly generates you more isk per hour/day.obviously player run corps could offer higher rates of interest the thier npc counterparts, this would make them more appealing and actuly create some competition and possibly a new \"price war\" for a previously overlooked area of the game.so whats the point of all this? players, no matter what level they are, can generate isk while afk just like thier skill points, it costs money to do but the longer you hold the shares, the more likly your are to see a return. not insain amounts of cash, but enough to feel like your actuly earning somthing while afk.this is just a rough idea i had, nothing set in stone, any comments/possible changes that peeps want to add please do.thanks for your time guys :)cs"
"ok..an agenda is posted before the meeting, agenda items need to be submitted to the chair by friday (for a sunday meeting) so that this is possible. the agenda can be found in the forum below us. after meeting minutes are also posted (as for hosting of such, i'm still waiting for a ccp minutes page update) in the same thread. unfortunately action points are hard to put in as the csm doesn't know the action ccp will take until the topics are submitted to ccp and they get a response back. as many have pointed out, csm is more a vetting process of what topics are raised with ccp on behalf of the players rather than a 'task force' of fixing things themselves. asking csm to 'action' things is pointless - they can't.csm can select their own topics to champion, but the public can champion their own topics too. if a topic gets enough 'thumbs up' votes, it's automatically added to the agenda as per the rules governing the csm.the edited minutes are there for the reason that if unedited, they would include a whole bunch of irrelevant side chatter (last meeting included an entire conversation about nero electing a horse to be a senator in the roman council). they also need to be checked for things that may be covered by an nda, so as such, are edited by necessity rather than in any attempt to 'keep secrets'. as for the dev blog - a lot of csm people think the same thing as you, a list of what has been put forward by them and inserted into the ccp production pipeline would have been extremely nice to show the player base, ccp thought it shouldn't. a way to do so was discussed fairly intensively at the ccp/csm meeting last night/yesterday.on a more general topic - i agree that the transparency and lack of communication of the csm is a major issue, but it is slowly being resolved. i expect the next csm session will run a lot more smoothly due to the efforts of the current csm."
"the next csm will learn from the mistakes of the past...transparency and discussion will be key to the next csm being a success. that's not to say the current csm haven't done a good job! many issues raised with ccp, some of which will shape planning and inform design in the coming year!there are many players committed to making the csm the success it should be (myself included), and we take the job of representing player views and issues seriously. vote for one of us!take care,arithron"
"not quite. the monster truck thread definately got enough thumbs up and as far as i'm aware was never taken to ccp though i admit i may be wrong but seem to remember csm's throwing it out before. now i'm not suggesting for one minuite that this should be in game but it should of been taken to ccp and they should of thrown it out as it starts a precedent for csm overuling the player base. that is a chatlog and not minutes, minuites are what is in fact posted even though they call them edited minutes, minutes by their definition are the important parts picked out of the meeting and i dare say nero's nag would have no place. on a side note i did notice on the forum's the chair refer to one or two of the council members by thier full title and at least another on the same page by a shortened version. while may not seem important, it could look as a certain favoritism to a member. we found this on my local council which i'm on, so we got in the habit of calling other members by thier title in the meetings and this also helped distance any comments made as being more in personal as we knew several of each other in personal life."
"yeah i dont have much faith in the current csm, though i wouldnt have faith in any other csm election either.personally, ive always wondered if i could actually be elected if i ran, but sadly i dont have enough time on my hands for that kinda thing...."
"high support counts means it automatically makes it onto the csm agenda. it does not mean it automatically goes to ccp. the monstertrucks issue was put on the agenda because of the high support count, and then promptly voted down because its ridiculous and not worth the time in the rare csm/ccp meetings."
"the primary function for this csm board was to help define the process and practices of future csm board. with a majority of the \"first times\" encountered, assessed and addressed, future csm boards can then properly focus on it's elected business.i'm not a fan of the csm itself, nor many on it, however with that said i'm not expecting much from them and i'm not going out of my way to bother (with) them either. you don't like this process, don't partake. no sweat off my back.note: i imagine somewhere in iceland there is a version of dogbert at ccp offices laughing his head off. \"see, we gave them the csm to moan about and look at them waste their energy attacking each other instead of us. moronic lemmings never fail you!\""
"lets not forget that ccp has very publicly patted themselves on the back for implementing the whole csm concept..it would seem rather foolish for them pr wise to then do anything to tarnish that..so the whole arguement about csm becoming irrelevant would only come from the player base failing to utilize it wisely rather than ccp failing to be responsive to it. like any democratic society the real responsibility comes from the voters. choose wisely and if you dont get what you wanted..did you realy want it in the first place..food for thought."
"hey miz, thankyou for a highly amusing thread. the harsh reality is however that the eve forums are not a good representation of the player base. i've run 2 general eve surveys now, and each one has clearly shown that the population of eve do not think the same way as forum posters such as yourself. the irony is that the csm topics are raised via these forums, so any good csm will actually raise additional topics not on the list here, through in-game discussions and other information sources.as for the first csm being a farce; it's by no means the best functioning csm i hope to see, but on the other hand, it could have gone significantly worse. so while i'm not able to say i'm proud of the 1st csms cohesion, i am pleased that nothing eve destroying made it to ccp and we've got through a majority of ground work for future csms, both as csm operating rules and setting our expectations with ccp."
"the idea is nice and all but - as usual with ccp - it's being turnes into a huge pile of bs.just look at the jerk-off answers given in the csm-ccp meeting (i'm paraphrasing here):csm: skill queue? ccp: yeah sure we kind of know this has been bugging the hell out of everybody for years on end, but hey, we kind of like it that way. oh sure we will \"look into it\".csm: switching all ammo at once? ccp: yeah well you know this is all difficult and stuff. and it might add \"l a g\". but sure we will have a talk with the server guys who will (totally unexpected) concur with our opinion so we can shelve this as well. m'kay?csm: forum software?ccp: well you know this really difficult and hard to do too so we will probably just do nothing and continue to ignore the problem.csm: 30 day gtc's?ccp: hmm we hear ya - but well we'd kind of much rather sell a ton of stupid bs products like mouse mats and key chains because you know having two seperate products it really much too expensve.this all reads to me like ccp is going to throw a few token bones to us yo they can pretend to actually listen to player requests while in realtiy all they are doing is continuing to walk the same old path.all those \"cannot be changed\", \"would be much work\", \"would add too much load\" answers are really driving me up the wall.instead of fixing preformance issues and usability problems they waste time on totally inane pointless garbage like ambulation (so they can pretend to be wow in space in the hope to scr-ape up a few more gormless marketing victims).ah well at least writing this made me feel a bit better."
"agreed.ambulation = secondlife in space. ooooooh, wow."
"actually the ambulation project is worked on by different sections than that of bug fixing and ship balance etc.but it is lame when they say \"its too hard\" they shld really say \"its a long way off\" or something"
"i'm going to propose assigning a certain dev to an issue, just like an issue is assigned to a csm. then there will be some accountability, and the csm that is responsible for the issue can get into contact with a ccp representative to get a status update or add further feedback.*is currently working on a document that explains how all of this works*we had a meeting with ccp yesterday, and i get the feeling that they agreed with the sentiment that some issues just end up in a black-box which neither csm nor player has any sight on, and that we need some means to give some more transparancy there.once i have a wiki running for the issues, we will likely see some more two way communication as well, see this as example:"
"i would dance if devs gave people the ability to switch all turret/missile ammo at once, i cant believe this isnt in place yet."
"ankhesentapemkah: good to hear that you are trying to get ccp to commit to a more open process.i wish you luck with it ;)"
"i got the feeling from the meeting that ccp are trying to be open. however, there's a limit on how much they can share. devs assigned to an area etc already happens, as obviously issues are directed at different depts within ccp. assigning a dev to an issue and a csm member just complicates things, especially if that csm member just shows up for meetings and occupies a slot on the csm.for ease of co-ordination and fairness, open dealings via csm/ccp meetings is what should remain the mainstay. that's not to say more ccp/csm meetings in a csm term aren't needed!perhaps an update on submitted issue progress could be a requirement at the start of each csm/ccp meeting, or a document that can be posted and accessed by players?take care,bruce hansen"
"i agree with you neresky and backing you to the hilt. maybe one of the csms can clarify this for you. i would hope so anyway..thats why we voted eh?"
"there is a lot more going on here than neresky can talk about due to eula but tbh ccp's actions stink like week old fish in this case."

"hello all,it's been 6 months since my last campaign went on, and i've learned a lot. i've encountered a fair bit of pvp recently, and have learned more about trade. i seek to represent the entire playerbase professionally, delivering the ideas you agree on to ccp for implementation.while i mainly represent the industrial side, i will do my best to make sure nothing would occur that would make the pvp side hindered in any way. i have proposed a few ideas to the playerbase before, some of which have been trashed and some have been endorsed. i will be an active member in the game, the csm, and the forums.my alt's webpage has some details on the items i plan to incorporate, and more will be added later to enhance it. likewise, i will be adding a forum on my website so players can contact me with any questions into csm operations, and i will reveal as much as possible without breaking the nda.some of the issues i plan to focus on are as follows:* industry (working a better system for manufacturers, making mining more important and varied)* macroers (introducing ideas to help eliminate macroers while not harming the true players)* ships (creating new ships and new ship ideas for players to diversify)* pvp (deciding on a reasonable anti-nano solution, introducing bounty hunting, etc)as to who i am in real life, here is my picture:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.you can view more about my game details here: my site"

"absolutely. i certainly know that reakktor media gmbh (developers of neocron and neocron 2: beyond the dome of york) allowed under-18s to be part of their community teams (equivalent to isd/aurora), allowing their legal parents/guardians to sign the nda on their behalf. of course, the people were chosen and interviewed to make sure they were mature enough, but knowing that one of the better members of that team was 14- well, let's just say that age is not a direct correlation to maturity. ccp really need to think that one over. i was considering applying for the csm this time round but this has left a sour taste in my mouth that has lead me to seriously reconsider an application."
"i admit bias by being an alternate, which excludes me from trips to iceland/fanfest and the like...hence i get nothing for my time. however, i see what the csm does behind the scnes and how ccp takes it seriously. guess you'll have to believe me there, no biggee if you don't ;)your point about things being proposed 2 years ago valid...thing is, something is now being done about them due to the csm raising these issues (on behalf of players that proposed them in assembly hall etc). had there not been a csm, are you so sure they would be looked at?the bounty hunter and merc issues that dierdra and i looked at and proposed are an example of something that has been formalised and pushed by the csm entirely...read some minutes that will be posted later this week.your arguments against the csm will make little difference, since the candidacy period is open until the 17th, then voting begins. there is going to be a second term of the csm, and a third etc. if you don't think it's working, run for a spot!take care,bruce hansen"
"again your your deliberatly missing the point.lets see if i can simplfy it for you?you expect few csm dealing not only with their own agenda, but with constant submissions from the playerbase to look over and think about, and with only 6 months to do it in, to do more than, or even the same as what a large group of people focused on a single issue managed to do in 2 years.your impossible expectations are no reason to disband the csm.so i again ask you to prove that you have done 1/10 as much as you expect them to do?i'm not asking if you could have done more than them, i'm not even asking you to do as much as them, i'm asking you to prove you have done one tenth as much as you expect them to have done.but i seriously doubt you are able to becasue that is the very basis of your agrumentative tactics, you say a has done more than b, and ask b to prove what they have done, knowing full well that b will spend so much time defending themselves they will never ask a to prove what exactly they have done. it's a cheap tactic often used by politicians in public debates.your own expectations are your own problem, not a sympton of the failure of the csm.as for being cordial, it makes no difference how you say something if what you say is offensive. an insult said with a smile is still an insult. at least i can say i have been honest when expressing my feelings.on the subject of false dilemma .... so far you have gone out of your way to paint this 'discussion' as you against the csm, it has not worked how you think it should be working and should be scrapped and thus it is you who is trapped within a false dilemma.again it is you who has attacked the very premise of the csm, it's operation, it's results and it's supporters. and while the entire enterprise is far from perfect it dosn't warrent the vicious attack by you and others.rather than work to make the system better you would rather tear it down completely, why is this? is it because if it does work, if it does get better dosn't that mean that it will more accuratly reflect the opinions and desires of the whole player base, rather than a select minority who would rather use the bullying tactics to get what they want while trying to suppress what others want."
"internet spaceships is serious business.i think imma stay with ccp + microsoft = evil corporation who doesnt care position.the devs did say something would be done. i cant read all possible futures... i'd love future sight but sadly i dont have it. so lets go with the devs arent liers option.not familiar at all with this... but devs have constantly spoken on how the system utterly fails. honestly is it that much a thing that needs fixing? should it get priority over the dozens of other bugged systems. perhaps u did get them to move it's priority up... perhaps they've had some guy in the basement working on it for a few years and he's getting close... so nothing changed. i guess i'll have to look into it.i'm not saying its not working as it should be. i also dont think it should be abolished.my point is that you guys are puppets and nothing you do will change anything. ccp does what ccp does. they only change that when there are excessive amounts of whiners whining. because mass whining rage quits hurt their profits."
"not 2 years. just 6 months. 2 years was just the length of time some of the changes that the csm was claiming credit for.i'm sorry but i dont recall where i said to disband the csm. i'm sorry if i said that. i never meant to.what i expected them to do is exactly what they did. i gave them 6 months silence. their purpose is to take the position of saying no to bad ideas instead of ccp being the ones saying no.well i guess it doesnt matter what i say to you. no matter what i say... you are going to take offense and i dont wish to do that. thusly i will end discourse with you."
"so you are saying the csm are puppets of ccp? yet, you admit you aren't familiar with issues that the csm puts forward to ccp? bugged systems get submitted via the bugs and fixes threads. the csm has a mandate to suggest changes for the future direction of eve, and these ideas and avenues are proposed via players. we see a lot of tweaks and bug issues submitted by the csm as some are irritating and have remained so for a good chunk of time. ccp have also taken these onboard.the csm works independantly from ccp. i view ccp differently than you. i see them as a committed company wanting (and striving) towards bringing a game for players that is rich in environment, opportunities and playability...and keeps players interested over long periods of time. it's in their best interests (financially) to make the game the best they possibly can. players play the game- it's a good idea to let them have an imput into features and the future direction. the csm is the conduit that makes this possible. it gives the players a voice.take care,arithron"
"you are correct you have never said that the csm should be disbanded, i sincerely apologise.i have therefore taking offense to a faulty assumption, as the csm is pretty much the only real route for individual or small groups of players to contribute to the game (no matter how ineffective it is) it's disbanding would pretty much remove my ability to have my say and that i was finding offensive."
"look at the threads in this forum regarding each meeting. the ones that have been done will have a link to the chatlogs, usually on page 3, and usually posted by jade(although i did enjoy the meeting where i posted the link faster than the guy who put the chatlog online). it'd be nice if there was a central spot to point you, but at present there isn't."

"i dont think this will happen because there are times when the test server could be unavailable for a few hours to a few days depending on the changes being tested, it wouldnt really benefit anyone to spend all thier time on the test server since there is no guarentee that it will even be up the next time they go to log in.i like the ops idea in that it would make it easier to test out certain game mechanics for new patches. hoever, i would have to disagree with it because it gives younger players the opporunity to fly ship they otherwise havent earned the right to fly yet in a consequance free environment, the thought that a brand new player could log onto sis and then get to experience flying a capital ship after a few minutes as opposed to a veteran who waited years is a little scary, plus since sisi is consequence free said pilots would really have no need to learn to fit and fly the ships properly after all who cares its only 100isk. the only way i would support this is if they limited sis to pilots with a set number of skillpoints."
"the test server would have more testing and less people screwing around being irresponsible with large amounts of isk if we could actually use the new features being tested"
"come on ccp, on cms was said this had high priority but there is still nothing on the server (test or real).so hurry make these ships an bit better."
"if this happens then citadel torps need an even larger buff than what ccp nozh is suggesting in doing, because of smartbombs.currently smartbombs on capital ships emit the blast from the edges of the ship, not the center part of the ship. that is fine, but in reality that gives the same mod (large smarty), which can be fit to a bc but more realistically a bs, a complete range boost by now being on the larger capital shipalthough i would love to see these things get a bit of love as you suggest. capital sized smartbombs are not needed. and smartbombs being used to take out citadel torps needs to be negated.will not support this issue as you propose now, but i do fundamentally agree they need some love"
"yeah ultimately if we get enough support and get it through the council thats how its going to be submitted - i just wanted to give enough meat for discussion on this thread - knowing that ccp have the internal talent to do the balancing and numbers for themselves is very useful!"
"oh i quite agree. the current citadel torp vs smartbomb/defender balance is simply wrong - that needs fixing. and if any future smartbomb overhaul increases their damage further than additional citadel tweaks will be needed to keep things reasonable. true - perhaps that could be looked at also - rooting the blast at center point of models? i'm not really a fan of the sub-capital modules being weapons of choice on the cap ships anyhow - would much prefer an actual capital smartbomb rather than the subcapital bombs auto range boosted by the model size. i'm open-minded on the capital smart bombs issue and welcome more debate and pros and cons there. you and james make some good points. how about if we narrow the effective submission text to a request for a general revamp of smartbombs that includes the skill specialization options, rigs and implants? and leave the numbers and balancing to the developers?"
"there is already a skill that makes smartbombs refire faster. really all it needs is an energy and fitting reduction skills to normalize it with other weapon systems. range increases however would be bad overall."
"regarding the debate over capitals and smartbombs, it seems like the two concerns - model size as a range bonus, capital ships not needing better sbs - can solve each other. make capital smartbombs, give them a radius of around 18 km or so(so as not to make them kill tacklers when used on a carrier/dread), and make all smartbombs emanate from the centre of the ship's model and not the edges. you'll ruin the price of officer smartbombs, since they'll lose much of their current market, but that can be counteracted by a buff now that their supercapital use isn't tying your hands."
"thats because the csm is a powerless group of power hungry wanabes that has not managed to influence any change whatsoever in its time. hinestly check out the dev blog which listed thier influence thus far - its empty. lol"

"absurd - many of us have spent the past 5 years setting alarm clocks etc to switch skills (yes i did when i started playing) and now the lamer wow newcomers are complaining that its too much hastle for them.stfu, stop crying for yet another nerf. ccp need to grow a pair and just say no."
"pfff! i used to play ascii games, you whiner!why improve when we can go backwards to the \"good old days\"?..."
"i'd much prefer a tech ii gas harvester/salvager role orientated frigate, but i suppose i'd settle for a tech ii logistics frigate if that was the only alternative ..."
"why can't we have both?"
"i kind of like the idea, but rather than a frigate, make the logistics ship a destroyer. there are already 5 t2 frigate classes, but only 1 t2 destroyer class (which has been heavily nerfed and is largely obselete)."
"well, in this [issue] tarminic specifically presented some logistics orientated designs instead. i'm in no way opposed to it, i'd just prefer a \"utility\" frigate with an alternative focus. if i didn't think it might be a little too overpowered or \"jack of all trades\" i'd suggest role/skill bonuses for gas harvesting, salvaging and logistics. i still fondly remember the first time i stumbled across the tech ii hull of the bantam in the form of a cosmos agent aboard a \"sparrow\". i was so excited, then so disappointed!"
"the idea is sweet but i agree about the scaling part.current proposal gives you fast locking frigs with a small sig radius so you end up with a slower version of interceptors.and with at least 3 med slots its suited for tackling as well.so i guess the slot layout needs some more attention to make this work as intended."
"it seems to be par for the course for quite a few csm members. whilst i can cope with csm members championing causes they themselves believe in, i do also worry when various issues get catapulted to the top of the list when little actual support and a lot of negative opinion has been expressed. this thankfully isn't one of them."
"okay this issue is deferred till next week, so some more patience please..."
"yes yes yes yes"
"i like this idea to an extent. we should, however, be able to form two groups of ammunition to use (sometimes people use both missiles and guns, sometimes they use different shells in different guns, etc).while this won't drastically reduce lag, it will reduce the number of calculations per second the client machine has to perform, meaning computers with poor cooling and with lower-end processors should handle combat somewhat smoother. sounds like a win-win situation, honestly."
"i'm not a missile user so not sure how large they are, but it seems nonsensical to have them the same size as bullets. therefore you might need a gun ammo bay and a missile bay. however, within that bay you could have as many different types of loads as possible. simply right click on each gun/launcher and it lets you select a load for that weapon from a list of what is stored in the appropriate ammo bay.alternatively, bin the whole 'bay' idea, and get the weapons to load direct from cargo, with a minor tweak upwards in cargo size to compensate for storing ammo there rather than in the weapon.i'm not a programmer or mathematician, but wouldn't that also benefit lag hits when changing ammo, even as suggested on other threads, to change ammo in all guns at the same time - since the operation is a 'pointing' one rather than a 'moving things around' one?"
"while i completely agree with the op there is another issue.for ccp solving reload problem in fleet battles will be like shooting itself in the foot.what's happening if you fly a non-amarr ship? well, when your clip is empty (eventualy) and since you almost never reload we have one less ship creating lag.poor tempest.. can you believe it can be even worse considering reload?i'm wondering what would happend if everybody would fly only amarr in fleet battles.. amarr nerf maybe? at least that's my choice, having to choose between my server and some whining.it's fair for non-amarr? hell no, but what's fair in life (and eve)."

"supported - though i'd like to see re-examination of docking games and other issues where bumping has become the default, as to why that's the case and what's broken about it that they have to bump in the first place (if anything)."
"bumping seems a little metagamy for my taste. would like to see this done away with."
"definatly agree with this one makes no sense whatsoever for a tiny ship to pput a much larger vessel of course by flying at them."
"supported but please dont swing the nerf bat too hard!"
"tax!it's ok not wanting to pvp and staying in the npc corps to be protected from it. but there should be a drawback to balance things out.npc corp pilots interact with each other, run missions together, mine, so on. they have the multi player part sorted.. nice big channel of people talking , sharing information, having fun.edit: plus this would be a very good isk sink."
"actually i'm going put a different take on the title of this issue, and say that i'm all in favour of purely solo players in npc corps being taxed. now as soon as the op and proponents identify a way to spot a purely solo player, we can talk again. i propose that the tax is cancelled the moment they have fleeted with someone else. problem solved, they have learned to interact with others...you're about two months too late. fleeting with someone can no longer be scammed, concord rules apply as though you weren't fleeted. besides, i gang with random people all the time, it's called factional warfare. oddly enough, i don't need to be in a player corp to have fun and pvp."
"epic @ topichmm, to get that straight. what kind of guys do we have in npc corp and how would they be affected by taxes? new players of course (if we had a dynamic tax, like 0% for the first 1/2 months, then they obviously won't be affected the time beeing a new player. i see no problem here) all time high sec solo mission runners (would be affected, and maybe some would make their own corp or join player corp/ally once a specific tax rate has been reached. perfect!) all time solo miners/traders/industrialists (wouldn't be affected, somehow unfair to mission runners/ratters. but this problem applies to player corps as well, so maybe you start another thread on this issue sometime ) griefer, ganker, scammer, any scout/trade alts ... (wouldn't be affected much)so, the only \"problem group\" affected would be mission runners and mission runner alts, right? well, it's a start, but as long as market transactions are not included, it's just a drop in the ocean. this beeing said, taxation of market transactions would be a fair deal in general to balance taxes for industrialists/traders and mission/runners/ratters.conclusion:taxes for npc corps wouldn't change too much and only punish mission runners, but the reason is that we would still have a missing tax on transactions. as this general problem applies to player corps as well, i see no reason why npc corps should be an exception support granted."
"hi, let me summarize the op's problem as he describes it and then demonstrate that he himself is the problem.1)op's problem: not being able to recruit players from npc corps.2)op's felt problem: lack of tax on npc corps and npc corps being safe haven from wardecs.3)op's proposed solution: tax players in npc corps4)expected result 1: more players play together5)expected result 2: additional isk sink let's analyze this point by point (and i know that i will be repeating what some people already said):1) imagine 3 players: a,b,c.a is ceo of a 1 man corp and wants a corpmateb is ceo of a 1 man corp and wants a corpmatec is in an npc corp and doesn't want to leave it.now a and b want ccp to tax c so he joins either a or b.if ccp does tax c, there are following possibilities:- c pays tax. leaving a,b and c unhappy.- c quits eve. leaving a and b unhappy and c badmouthing eve.- c creates his own corp. leaving a and b unhappy.- c joins either a or b. (probably the one with the lowest tax) leaving either b or a unhappy and c wishing he had created his own corp instead.-> wouldn't the best solution be a and b merging corps and c untaxed in his npc corp. ?my point is: recruit people with similar goals, don't force others to adopt yours. merge with others and put an end to 1 man corps rather then upsetting the communities which build in npc corps. (yes, communities in npc corps do exist)2) what are taxes used for ? to pay office rents and finance a goal common to the pilots in the corp. the money a member pays doesn't vanish. the money returns to him in the form of a corp hangar, maybe free ammo, maybe a pos in 0.0 ... you name it. if the money in your corp just vanishes, i would suggest you leave that corp a.s.a.p. so why should npc corp members pay a tax that would be a deliberate amount and a pure \"isk sink\" as the op put it himself. i see no reason. oh sure, you can't be wardecced ... but then you can't wardec either. but you can still fly to 0.0 and shoot everyone. vice versa a 0.0 corp gives a damn about wardecs, they live under constant threat. so aren't the high-sec player corps actually hypocritical. they live in peace unless someone decides to wardec them. there is zero danger of losing a ship during peace and a war costs the declaring party isk. shouldn't all empire corps pay a tax when they are not at war, to compensate for the lower risk compared to 0.0 ?3) compare point 1. the op's inability to recruit likeminded players understanding the need for a tax in return of (insert free items / service here) can only be solved by taxing players which do think differently then the op yeah, right. you may lol here ! 4) the op expects more players playing together. he didn't say wether he meant cooperatively or adversely though. actually it doesn't matter because in both cases you need players willing to join a player corp, willing to work towards a common goal, but not necessarily on the same side. (the soldier in north-corea does the same job as the soldier in south-corea. neither of them is a one-man army, but they don't fight on the same side.) so i assume it's more a question of numbers. let me depict the op's logic with an analogy. counter-strike is a popular fps game which can very well be played 1 vs 1. but it's more fun when there are more players on the server because the tactics and teamwork get more significant. now the op sits on a server with only 1 opponent but wished both teams had more players. now what to do ? oh yes, of course ... he logs onto the wow forums and starts a topic: \"why pay to play if you could play css for free: join ip. x.x.x.x:x.\" wouldn't it be more logical to search other css servers with more players (i have a hunch they like playing css at least a bit). i ran out of space ... (edit: spelling mistakes)"
"5) i may be dumb ... i am ... but what does an additional isk sink have to do with the type of corporation a player joins. or is it the tax rate. maybe security status. no ? faction standings. no ? gah ... i give up ... i'm not mathematically inclined. last but not least: demonstrating that the op is part of the problem and not part of the solution. (you may all hate me ... later, first read)imagine 4000 warriors aching for a good fight. imagine them in following situations.1) they all are in the same corp. 4000 unhappy warriors: no ennemies at hand.2) they are split evenly across 2 warring factions. 4000 happy soldiers. 2000 in each camp.3) they are all split evenly across 4000 warring factions. 4000 angry posters protesting that their 1 man faction has not enough warriors because all the carebears decided not to pay taxes and also avoid war. do i have to get more explicit. (edit) forgot to add: awe and respect for people coming up with very good points and reasoning. i am aware that my post recycles some of what has been said. additional considerations: a) ccp markets eve as a \"sandbox\"-type game with a player driven economy. sandbox means: everyone is free to do what he wants to do ... even being pressured by other players in-game ccp just provides the sandbox. player driven economy means: the economy (= mining, salvaging, researching, inventing, manufacturing, selling are part of the game.) w00t, it's not all about pvpb) ccp actively helps solo-players. power of 2 c) mmo = massively multiplayer online-game. as stated by previous poster that is: massively multiplayer (a lot ... or even more in the case of tranquility) online-game (it uses da interwebs somehow ... no clue how *looks at router* with that box)ok, that means many players interacting (world of warcraft, guild-wars, project entropia ... are all considered mmos ... heck you could even add second life to that list, and that one has a lot of pvp )actually i even consider the radio-moderators and lottery organizers part of the community (sometimes annoying though)d) ambulation may even attract more station-huggers (that is if ccp adds hugging to the possible gestures)... and : no support."
"nice to see you so aptly demonstrate your own qualities for employment (i.e. none) - perhaps you should read threads like this before mouthing off about someone. this sets aside the fact that you're talking rubbish - nobody has said eve is bad because you can pvp."

"sounds like an awesome idea to me. my alt would still fly a freighter when needed but this gives more fun options and avoids some risks of losing such a huge investment."
"well, i acknowledge that it provides ccp with a legitimate appearing mechanism for removing csm members. obviously, as things stand now they're able to can anyone at any time for any reason anyway, while probably the only concern for them being the potential fallout for being seen doing it to a csm after they lauded the whole thing in their public relations material. at least this kind of thing would give them something to point at in justification to the community, i suppose.while i don't entirely think ccp are the kind of people to rock up, black-bag someone and drive off with them into the dark of night never to be seen again (without good reason) i am a little uncomfortable about the idea that a csm member banned from the forums is automatically kicked from the csm. no offence meant to the forum moderators, but since anything worth a ban is usually deleted from a post it doesn't seem very accountable to, well, us.while i figure a certain degree of good conduct is required i've never expected any elected official to be an angel. on the other hand, anything they could post worth a ban would probably/usually incline me to be happy that they're gone but this won't always be the case.i can't help but worry that this just mandates the potential for abuse."
"forum ban - noingame ban - yesyou can get banned from the forums, very easily. i have seen people get forum bans for less than what csm members have posted."
"gets my vote"
"supported, if it's not already the case. yes there's an issue about whether they were justly banned, but then you're into 'did ccp do the right thing' territory, and given that 99.999% of the discussions in the entire set of forum constitute that in one form or another...."
"there is no way in hell that a forum moderator should have final say on who can/cannot be a member of the csm.if you get banned in-game then yes, i could see a reason for removal from csm, but being temporaryily banned from this forum should not result in removal from the csm, especially with the inconsistencies of recent forum bannings (darius banned for trolling, but jade not for doing the same thing is just one example i can think of)."
"i'm unhappy with some appearances of the csm on the forums, but i have mixed feelings with being booted from the csm for a forum ban. i'm more for an investigation if that happens, and the ccp people behind the csm scolding the csm in violation, and deciding on action, rather than a forum ban resulting in removal 100% of the time.after all, if this goes through, people can be provoked by alts or throwaway accounts on purpose, and it will likely result in a lot more trolling and harrassment of csm on the forums to get them to lose their temper and get themselves banned."
"you are kidding right? ever heard of conflict of interest?if a csm member is banned from the game/forums the csm itself should decide among themselves about the fate of their fellow member."
"who got b&?bet it was a goon"
"well i'd agree there could certainly be some kind of behind the scenes discussion going on - but ultimately if you are getting forum banned under the new enlightened forum regime we've got now then something is going wrong ank. people do get sent emails from the moderators telling them when they've had posts removed/moved/whatnot and why and if they keep insulting other players then its really their own fault.well to be quite honest, i very much doubt any csm present or future is going to get as badly trolled and insulted and flamed and stalked than i've been this summer and at the end of it all i've still got my posting rights and managed to avoid breaking forum rules handling csm business in the midst of some extremely ugly discussions. i've had literally hundreds of forum alts trolling me and the ultimate answer is simply to install caod-cleaner and block entire organizations and alt posters if you really can't handle these people with an even temper on eve online. i've found it hugely liberating to be able to say what i really think on shc from time to time mind you :)"
"ban from the game or a ban from the forums? the proposal also included forum bans. wasn't jade banned from the forums at one point prior before sitting on the csm? a ban from the game i would agree. but not a ban from the forums. to get banned from the game you had to violate the eula. banning from the forums means that you were being an over emo troll."
"definitely agree."
"personally... if you get banned from the forums... you should get banned from the game and vice versa... as there's no real reason to be one or the other without the other.as far as the csm goes.... the csm should be responsible for itself... but i have no idea what sort of system they have running.... but its a bit painfully obvious that anyone who gets banned from either or..should quickly be removed from the csm (provided its a just cause)/semi_supportps: anything can be viewed as a potential serious abuse in power.... welcome to paranoia."
"yes."
"i was going to vote against this because it can be easily abused, but then thats a good reason to vote for it."
"agreed. just basic common sense."
"no, not kidding. yes, i've heard of conflict of interest.i agree that the csm itself should decide the fate of their fellow member, however this is problematic, as it means a faction in power can totally kick-out all other votes in csm-members.so based on the comments so far, i'll revise the ejection process like this;forum banning gives the csm members the right to vote on whether the forum banned csm member is kicked from the csm. one vote may be taken per forum banning."
"yes"
"/signed"
"so who got banned?"
"i still don't really like it, but that's much less bad."
"depending on the csm member, and what alliance (if any) they are in, ejection via csm candidate votes could be just as bad!a forum ban could be looked at by ccp (not forum admin) first, the csm informed and some reasoning given (ie, serious breach/not serious breach). the csm could then vote, ccp be informed of the wishes of the csm, and ultimately someone in ccp to take responsibility for a final decision.a forum ban would entail some warnings first, plus the csm member would not be able to interact with players via the forum (which i'd say is a pretty important duty). if csm members are aware of the consequences of actions beforehand, then choose to act in unprofessional ways, i'd say they had fair warning.take care,arithron"
"upon reflection, and in danger of opening another can of worms...what about removal of a csm member by vote for dereliction of duty?the definition of duty could be decided (a commitment agreement by csm members) at the start of a csm term.take care,arithron"
"is any one else sensing a witch hunt is a foot? getting support to take to ccp to go after someone currently on the csm? i thought there was some kind of movement already to oust jade for some things that everyone had heart burn about,had a lot of support and ccp said \"nope.\"well if this is a last poke in the eye of whoever it is on the board..i am going to need popcorn for this.please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"ofc this should be the case, if they are unable to conduct themselves in a proper manner ingame or on the forums, then they have no place on the csm.or perhaps you believe that ccp allows any old muppet to be a forum mod and furthermore allows said muppets to ban anyone for no reason."
"heck yes!"
"as far as i know nobody on the csm is forum banned at the moment. i don't think its so much a witch hunt as just trying to set up some solid rules of conduct for the people going into a second term and being joined by the new intake. as for people going after me - bah, that was just trolling. nobody sensible took that to heart - certainly not ccp or the csm."
"for myself, i just can't seem to conect the ingame stuff to the forum stuff. forum stuff your really not logged in. whilst in game i see and feel a completley different manner a play and behavior. that when i get my role on so to speak.here..it's like having a beer with the fellas and talking about how much you suck \"in-game\" or talk about how we can fix this or that, and tell funny stories of **** poor fittings and scamms.but i guess most just can't seem to sperate themselves from ingame and out."
"bit different for a csm delegate though, you do need to use the forums to communicate with the players and you can't afford to use them lightly - ultimately its a medium for discussion and has to be treated with respect."
"jade - changing the way eve sovereignty works is an interesting proposal toward helping to reduce the reliance of power blocs and alliances on massive fleets and decrease blob warfare thus reducing lag, however that defeats the purpose of this topic which is quite plainly - give us massive fleet battles that don't lag - period.perhaps there needs to be two additional components added to sovereignty that takes into account the amount of days a friendly and hostile force has actively occupied a system or area of space called - residency and occupation.these would be composite scores based on the number of active pilots over time (excluding afk campers) in a system that would determine a weighted average of a suite of bonuses that would discourage blobs or enable more distributed warfare. these bonuses would need to target anti-blob mechanisms such as bombs, dds, etc. (perhaps a new miniature dd needs to be developed to take advantage of this properly)grid loads through star gates/jump bridges and jump portals have always been troublesome and allowed the upper hand to the force already occupying the field. if an option was added to allow inbound jumping fleets to distribute randomly into other grids in the system and then coordinate a rally point from there it would reduce the node strain arising from massive gate camps and breaking forces. this would definitely make warfare more mobile and fast paced as it would rely on more probing and system scouting to locate the opposing forces.spamming gates with fighters is also a contributing factor to gate grid loads - there needs to be something added to discourage fighter spamming under selected circumstances where the node is under severe loads or at least allow a fleet to properly counter a fighter heavy force with tactics or weaponry."
"i like!"
"no"
"my understanding is that larger limits can cause strain on the database.whilst the in-game mail length can be a problem, the max length for forum posts should be sufficient for most purposes - if you really understand the point that you want to make, you shouldn't have any difficulty making it concisely."
"bah, you just hate long posts you damned amarrian zealot!but seriously - the forum post issue will get resolved at the point that ccp overhaul the forum software. there's no real point us promoting or advocating \"improve forumz!\" issues because ccp know there is a problem, know what they have to do, have scheduled improvements in the coming year and its just a matter of waiting and seeing there. on the issue of concise point making - well as a fan of impassioned rhetoric i'm obviously going to disagree with you but there are some kinds of posts it would be nice to have in single inputs - war diaries, stories, ic pieces, recognition threads, resource lists, etc etc. so lets not tl:dr ideological purity blind us to practical advantage there."
"it's text. even without compression, assuming a million evemails a day are sent(which there aren't), making them all 3x as long as the current limit(which they won't be) will add about a gig of data. a gig of storage space, at current prices, costs about a quarter for the home user, and presumably a fair bit less when you buy hard drives by the hundred or thousand. the gig of bandwidth to transfer that data costs the home user about another quarter, and ccp certainly gets a better deal on that than you or i. so even for me personally to hold and serve the data will cost about $15/month, and for ccp it's probably more like $10/month. in other words, a single additional subscription, even at annual rates. as for forum posts, while this is sort of a moot point because it's getting fixed, anyone who can say it in 4000 characters probably still will - most people don't like typing all that much. for those who do(like, say, me and jade), they'll split it into multiple posts when needed anyways, which doesn't save space at all. all you'll do is get rid of those absurd \"reserved\" posts that the current system requires."
"i only support this for eve mail and bio.forum post of chat post are totally fine with me"
"the reason why players are willing to tolerate risk is for reward. the reward in absolute terms does not matter, however - it is the reward compared to other options that matters. the rate that is most important for this calculation is the risk-free rate of return - the best interest you can make without exposing your money to any plausible risk. in the real world this is generally taken to be a us treasury bill, and in eve it's your wallet(since the lack of forward-looking contract enforcement prevents any investment from sanely being called \"risk-free\"). investments are then compared based on their reward over the baseline vis-a-vis their risk. thus, a canadian government bond with next to no risk needs to offer next to no risk premium, whereas a zimbabwean government bond needs to offer a gargantuan risk premium to make it worth investing in it given the risk of default. eve finance works in a similar fashion. investments range from low-risk sources of cash flow(datacore-farmer characters, bpos), to medium-risk(reputable businesses looking for investment), to high-risk(things you expect to be a scam). at each level, you demand a higher return, for obvious reasons. what your proposal would do is to completely throw off the risk-reward ratio for the game. you would destroy the value of long-term investments, because why would you invest in a t2 bpo to earn 6% per month if everything stays stable when you can just sit your money in stock and earn 5% per month? a lot of people who invested into datacore standings, or into invention skills and interfaces, or into bpos, or into anything similar are having their entire investment strategy undercut, because you're upping the risk-free rate of return and thus making their risky rates of return almost laughable. as such, you will destroy the value of these investments - you'll have effects on the character market, on the blueprint market, and on all forms of player-driven investment, ranging from ipos to deposit banks. also, your proposal goes against the grain of mmo design. the player gets nothing for free, at least not when it comes to assets. you want money, you need to go earn it. you can earn it by good old-fashioned murdering people and robbing their corpses, or by doing something productive - producing, trading, providing a service, or investing in those who do one of the former. you do not under any circumstance get to put your money into a black box called \"free cash!\" and have a developer assurance that it will, in fact, spit out free cash with no further effort on your part. also, your rate of 1% per hour is astoundingly high. it doubles your money wvery three days with reinvestment, or every four without reinvestment. even at the rate you seem to have meant, 0.1% per hour, you double your money in 694 hours, or st under a month. nothing in game at present pays out at that rate, or anything even close. for comparison, t2 bpos are priced for about 5% return per month, and those require fuel costs for the pos and a lot of effort moving things around to keep them fueled. if this system were implemented, anything above 2-3% per month would be far too high. i disagree with it on principle even if the rate were that low, but i want to make sure that you at least have a sense of reality when it comes to what sort of rates we would see."
"no we already have enough \"risk free\", isk faucets in game thanks."
"ok no worries, thanks for the input guys. it was just an idea i was throwing out there :)"
"so we agree on 3 issues then...1 - the csm cannot action anything and is therefore a redundant process, if they cannot action anything and the dev blog in which thier achievements was listed was essentialy empty, it is somewhat of a waste of time.2 - despite the fact that in many threads the csm claim that they do not have time to cover many issues, in your own words they waste time on \"a whole bunch of irrelevant side chatter\".3 - the lack of transparency forthcoming from the csm is a major issue.glad we see eye to eye on that then."
"its an advisory council for players to give advice to ccp - not sure what else you expected? the \"achievements\" for this csm will be: a) setting up the process, b) making it work, c) promoting issues which will influence and prioritize game development cycles. if you want a quick win its not going to happen. devs don't snap their fingers and implement fully prototyped and tested game alterations in 5 months flat - just doesn't work like that. you'll see the in-game effects of the first csm's advocacy beginning to happen next year by which point some of us won't be in offense any more. i've certainly had the time to cover and advocate every issue i've considered to be important in this first term. i think most of the other csm's will be able to say the same. ultimately we've debated and advocated a whole slew of issues and got some real progress on influencing the future development path for the game. sure there are some disappointments - i'll cover some of mine in my final assessment posts at the end of the term - but there have been some good accomplishments and end of the day i'm pretty happy with the performance of a good number of the csm delegates and alternates who have aided the process.public chatlogs of our meetings? minutes from the csm/ccp discussions? public thread advocacy? hell, i've even had chatlogs from private channels and 3rd party forums brought up as smear and scandal material. i think its been pretty transparent and ultimately i'm going to be posting a summary of my activities on the csm as i leave office listing all the issues i promoted and why, and a full voting record. all the meetings i chaired will be on the public record as chatlogs and i'll be extremely open about what i think worked and what didn't work in this inaugural session."

"the policy is very logical. it discourages blobbing past the limits of server performance.if this policy was reversed it would leave the game open to more harmful abuse, where the largest blocks in the game could potentially field node breaking fleets without risk."
"it surprising how bob/pets pilots constantly act like they've never been on the laggy losing side of a grid load or crashing node. perhaps it's because they haven't been. the hubris and sheer volume of posts of bob/pets toward declaring the current game mechanics and client/server performance are more than adequate is also surprising. perhaps it's because the lag and crashes never seem to quite effect them."
"no, i just don't waste my time trying to blame everyone else for my actions."
"right now there are some very odd things going on in pos management. one of the things that we discovered in our corp (and no one seems to be able to find a way around) is that if you have any corp array access other than just viewing, you also have some very powerful rights management as regards the pos itself.this is not good. the purpose of a corp array is, at least in our corp, to be able to pick up and drop stuff off as needed for other corp members. that might be ore, ammo, items for invention or manufacturing etc. i frequently drop missiles that i pick up as loot for those using caldari ships for instance, because i don't use very many (if any) on my ships.rather than 'role management' each with overbroad powers, it would be good to see something less granular - more similar to what you can do with corp hangars in stations where you have offices, for instance. in this way you could give a new corp member access to the array so they could take out ammo etc. without giving them the ability to change the password, shut down the forcefield or unanchor the thing!please, csm, could you examine this issue and see about bringing it up to ccp? we have filed a petition on it, but i believe that is unlikely to do more than wind up as a note someplace.thanks!"
"this seems like pretty fundamental stuff. i wonder why it's not in place now?"

"just as in rl. a very small part of the eve population actually voted when they where asked to do so. could be explained by not knowing what to expect from the csm and by lack of time to read up all which was proposed during campaigns. currently i see the csm as a form of filter, helping ccp to sift through the huge number of postings on this site. the csm helps finding the rare gems and pre-polishes them. but ccp decides which ones they actually cut and put on display. after all they own the shop, they run the financial risk.the csm members seem very dedicated to me. ( good job !)concerning ambulation: as long as game magazines playtest eve for 1 day (2 if ccp gets lucky) and end their review with: \"eve has nice graphics but your avatar is only a picture 32*32 pixels ...\" that long ccp needs ambulation to keep up with other mmos. (and yeah: i don't think very much of mmos featuring 3d avatars which swing their weapon once every 5 seconds, with floating numbers above the head of opponents to indicate a hit. ah well ... at least you can dance in those mmos.)but i think ccp promised to add useful features to ambulation. i hope they add the macarena."

"the ancient greek form of democracy (where it originated) was indeed like that - but the definition of 'demos' (the people) was pretty narrow. it did not include women, slaves, foreigners, mad people... in fact, to a greater or lesser degree it basically covered individuals conforming to points 1 through 6 in your post the modern form of democracy may have widened the definition of 'demos', but it is probably more appealing to and more open to corruption by self-serving individuals than many other forms of government."
"the insane still can't vote, and the only country i know of that allows even nominal foreigners to vote is the united kingdom, where apparently they consider resident colonials to not really be foreigners. also, i'd wager that you won't find any slaves voting in the present day either. as for the susceptibility to the self-serving, i disagree entirely. power corrupts, famously, but power attracts the corrupt just as well, and it always has. whether you're a flatterer in the royal court, a warlord conquering for personal glory(read: ale and women), an intriguing noble, or any of the thousand other varieties of corrupt power-seekers in history, including lying politicians, you're going to find a way to seek power. the difference is, a lying politician can screw you over less with it, because you can vote him out again in a few years."
"depends on your definition of insanity.anyone and everyone votes in this day and age..... the standards of whats considered foreign...and insane.... are not where you think they are.and \"voting them out\" in a few years... is a few years too many."
"insanity is defined far more narrowly these days than in years past, but if you're involuntarily institutionalized for mental illness, say, i'm pretty sure you don't get to vote(although i haven't looked into it, so it's possible that somewhere a legislature themselves in need of involuntary institutionalization has extended the right to those people). foreign i define as \"not a citizen\", using whatever the legal definition of citizenship is locally, and as i said, i'm pretty sure it's only the uk that allows non-citizens to vote, and even then they're not really \"foreigners\" in the same sense, being subjects of her majesty resident in the uk. as for it being a few years too many, sometimes it really can be(which is why i'm a huge proponent of recall legislation in real life), but i'd rather live under a bad elected leader for a few years than a bad unelected leader for his lifetime. say what i will about someone like jimmy carter, i'd take him over a castro, kim, *******, mugabe, or their ilk any day of the week.edit: seriously, i can't use the name of the recently-hanged iraqi dictator? i can understand the german one, given the ubiquity that led to godwin's law, but sh was a piker compared to uncensored stalin or mao."

"way back when this csm stuff was first talked about, the idea was that popular ideas would get put through via the csm. lately i'm seeing a lot of 'i support this, putting on the agenda for next meeting' by current csm members on issues that don't have that much support, or worse, appear to have quite a vocal opposition which cannot be quantified thanks to this forum lacking a proper poll.i just wanted to ask what people's views were. should the current and future csm members be championing causes, or acting as an interface for the community, or both?to me it's tough whichever way you cut it - in an ideal world you voted for the right people so they should champion your causes - but eve is big and diverse enough that this may not be true. i'd be happy with causes if they were at a lower priority than obviously popular issues...equally i suppose you could argue that since all the csm can do is suggest, it doesn't matter, we have ccp as final arbiter of whether idea x is a good idea or not, but that comes off as very cynical..."
"that's a really hard question. the problem is that there's just some issues which are extremely controversial, but where the general public has a misconception about the actual problem. an example is the people who want t2 bpo's removed.people thinks that t2 bpo's are still a bad thing for eve, though this is certainly not the case.i hate to sound elitist, but some issues are not simple enough that we can agree on them nor can we all be right. somebody has to be right, and ccp must be that entity who decides on who this is. some issues are also not very mainstream, yet they are damn important for eve as a whole. an example is the economics issues which i have been advocating and will continue to do so. a very small minority cares about these, but do realize that are just as important as 0.0, mission and low-sec issues."
"i mostly fall to the edmund burke position on this one - we elect representatives for their judgment, not for their ability to slavishly follow the whims of their constituents. as long as representatives are honest in their campaigns, people should basically know what they'll be getting when they cast their vote - lvv does economic issues, ank does carebear stuff, jade tries to overhaul 0.0, and so on. there always needs to be checks and balances, like the automatic escalation of an issue with a certain support level(currently ~2800 votes), and the short terms of office that also increase accountability, but overall i will largely leave the choice of issues up to the representatives following the general positions laid out in their election campaigns. they should consider public levels of support and opposition, but it's only one factor. after all, if support was the only metric, why bother having an election?"
"vague labels such as 'carebear stuff' need a little more definition. empire activities are vast and complex in their interactions. the term 'economic' covers a vast multitude of areas (one could argue that anything connected with isk is economic for example).having experience of particular spheres of game play might make a candidate a bit more knowledgeable in that sphere, but it doesn't make such a candidate an expert or any more qualified to deal with issues in that sphere than other candidates.however, it might mean that issues seemingly picked from random from the jita threads for agendas actually are issues that interest particular candidates.personally, i look for issues that show a degree of thought, define an issue well, and qualify as affecting the majority of players and making eve a better gaming environment. i don't think it follows that i'd need vast experience of the sphere the issue stems from; i just need an open mind, ability to see outside the box, and the ability to weigh up the pros and cons before making a decision. maybe this is what you mean by electing for their judgment?it's clear to me that ccp want ideas for the future development of the game; players needn't get bogged down in the finer details! at times, csm members also get into conflict with the finer details. the ability to stay objective should be a mainstay for any candidate.take care,arithron"
"i was vague with how i referred to their topics of preference, but if you look through the past csm agendas, and the topics that they have created personally, their opinions and styles are pretty obvious. it was only intended for illustration, though, so a bit of a lack of specificity is tolerable imo. my point was that the nature of the electoral system tends to lead to very factionalized representation. the goons vote for a goon, the bears vote for a bear, the industrialists vote for an industrialist, and so on - not always, but pretty often. fortunately, a lot of the issues are similarly factionalized - most non-industrialists don't need to care about whether components are used in production or not - and so representing the assorted groups leads to most of the niche issues getting checked off, and the broader issues(lag, forums, etc.) will be raised by just about any of the reps. it's certainly worthwhile to have generalists on the council, but the voting system tends to skew it more towards specialists, and there's nothing wrong with having a few of them too. as for my comment about electing people for their judgment, the point burke(and, by quotation, i) was trying to make was that representative democracy is not direct democracy. you do not elect a representative for the sole purpose of listening to his constituents and doing what they demand on any given issue at any given time. you run to represent them, by using your own judgment, not to parrot them. this is why election platforms matter - if we were just electing avatars, trust would be the only factor. since we are electing councillors, their opinions matter more than ours - you elect somebody who you believe will represent your own methods of thought and take care of the things you want taken care of, not merely somebody who will follow the mob. incidentally, this is why honesty matters so much in politics - anybody who says they think like x and then acts like y is being elected on a fraudulent basis, and since those claims are all the voters can judge based on, they are diminishing the quality of the voters' representation by their deceptions."
"i attribute the low population of 0.0 most of the time to the fact that you only need a high population for that duration that a meaningful fight is going on. that's 0.0 for the most part. nobody, a random scout or nano, some gatecampers, and then huge blobs. the rare mid-sized roam and finding two of them in the same area is incredibly improbable. we're talking about non-nano pvp right? there's nothing in the gap between the lone nano's and the large blobs when it comes to targets, so there are no attackers or calls for defense at those engagement sizes. you can size up the enemy and determine if they can hit a pos and instantly know whether to log or go defend a pos.other than that, participation is very voluntary. with a little luck and a lot of watching local and maybe both, it's really hard to get ganked in 0.0 in your own system. for countering roaming attackers, this means it's possible to simply let the tide go back out.basically what i'm saying is that the reason why it seems like 0.0 is either rapiers at chokepoints or blobs smashing towers is because there's nothing in between to demand anything else and 0.0 lifestyle has evolved into a culture driven by that fact. if there was an intermediate facility between naked space and the pos, there would be intermediate-sized objectives, and medium sized responses.you're not just asking about why people use nano's right? that's tactical. midsized gangs can go roam and do some decent havoc when they catch the right targets flat-footed, but they have a harder time forcing engagements and a much harder time getting out of bad ones. nano's offer both those advantages and that's their sexy.at the point of rambling more granular sources of attention would lead to more granular tactics of harassment to draw more granular responses in less blobbable environments. this would work in favor of the small gang who could then pick an objective appropriate to their goals and shape the size of the response. at current, the targets are pretty binary and so are the responses.at least that's what was on my fortune cookie at lee po house of soy."
"i think there should be objectives for small gangs, so it can be profitable to have a quick and disciplined raid against a larger foe. large fleets also take a longer time to assemble and to respond, by the time the small gang of raiders should already have had a chance to escape...large groups should patrol their space, and small groups should be able to sneak behind enemy lines and cause actual damage (and get some nice booty in the process).i've supported issues regarding these problems in this csm, and it is absolutely something i want to put more effort in in the next csm incarnation."
"this is a great idea."
"definitely is and one of the big reasons i hope ank gets re-elected for the 2nd term."
"with the advent of small anchorable structures coming, these might just be the ticket small gangs are looking for to utilise 0.0 space. essentially, what is really missing is a true covert ops/black ops that can sneak down pipes and setup requisite jump points for a small gang to jump to from empire...that would create a bit of fun and mayhem behind the lines. of course, the small gang would still need to get back...alternately, look at the pipes which present natural choke/easily defendable points to prevent access to 0.0 space. making it easier to jump into 0.0 space could be one possibility...you have to define the goals of small player gangs a little more:are they for pvp in 0.0 against alliances etc (annoying to alliances, but no longer term damage done).orare they for quick mining/spawn/exploration runs (quick isk-making ventures with risk)orare they small-scale war groups sent by other alliances to test/destroy/harass the local sov holders and allies.perspective is everything. depending on what goals you have, your envisioned solutions might be different (and end results wanted). i included other possible goals (and probably missed some!) as i see any solution as having to be suitable for any small gang (regardless of goal). i'm for the ability to loot and pillage...lightning strikes, quick getaway, nothing permanent done that can't be fixed with a bit of isk and tender-loving care. black ops gangs...i'd listen to any sensible idea though on the matter. i'm of the opinion that it could be something that ccp could look at to enrich this style of gameplay though!take care,arithron"
"use more lotion. \"small gang targets\" is kind of a landmine to some people.i just had a fairly promising \"what if\" that goes like this:what if the route to being a permanent 0.0 power went like this:1) you can build standalone self-constructing facilities that produce the backbone income of 0.0, but require production facilities in high-sov systems in order to process into space bling. they are more vulnerable, but with low risk. income is transient if you can't defend anything, but flows quickly if you can win some quick battles.2) once you get your station(s) etc and get some high sov systems with planetary control (going on the basis of fahtim's 0.0 thread a few pages down) you can build the \"high society\" structures that eat production from the initial structures in order to build space-bling. this is the backbone of turning the young emperors into space pimps who are middle men for space bling.3) once you get enough constellation sov and other cool stuff, you can build research facilities that crank out bpc's for really nice space bling. at this point, it's a true player empire.in short, give up-and-coming players into 0.0 a fast route to access, but make it transient and unstable as well as tethering it to the production means of larger alliances, just as players are tethered to empire for npc fuel etc.this might be the key to getting a more granular system that the large alliances won't throw a fit at. their empires will be constantly eroding and they will be losing raw materials, but if those materials have to go through them, the overall power landscape still moves relatively slow.the granular structures become the subject of mid-sized gang warfare while the alliances duke it out over the top-level production facilities and research capacity etc. 0.0 is more accessible and more meaningful in the same stroke.everyone wins"
"no opinions are correct. all they are is opinions, and yours are no better than anyone elses, regardless of what you and the majority may think. there is nothing inherently wrong with racism or dislikes toward sexual preferences, its simply what society has taught you. i challenge anyone who cares to logically explain why it is wrong. you can start off by explaining why \"damaging\" other peoples lives(which is arguably what this type of 'hate' does) is wrong when you, as a business owner or employee, make your living by increasing or maintaining high sales at the expense of others reduction in those areas, thus damaging their lives, a position you wouldnt want to be in yourself. if we want a world where our own opinion is heard rather than repressed, every other opinion must be accepted, regardless of how disgusting you find it to be. that is my opinion.that said, i recognize theres a paradox here, namely that i must accept that some people want censorship despite the foolishness i find it to be. ccp is running a business and have made your version of bigotry a punishable offense in their game, at least on paper. i reckon you may get your opinion through if you complain loud enough.rock on."
"well ... still waiting ... hope a csm could atleast comment on whats going on with this issue before the new csm class rolls in ...thanks"
"next weekend? when? the 11th and 12th? or the 18th and 19th? that way i will be here shortly after to hear my answers. because, from what you have said, ccp does not appear to be too \"enthused\" about doing this... unless i have misinterpreted what you have written, which i think i have not. in any event, whatever the news, keep us updated, we can start a threadnought later - worked for goons didn't it?"
"i see no downside i even think you should be able to set your skills like you can in eft so you can test anything with any skillset in realtime rather than numbers of eft"
"supported"
"thumbs up for thumbs down!"
"be quiet yourself - i strongly disagree with you.i have just noticed that the skill-queue has disapeared from the drawing-board and is neither in development or under testing.what does this mean now? has it been rejected by ccp or what ??ccp said they would look into it and are thinking about either a dual-training system or a 1+skill-queue.could we please have an official statement about the status ?greetings belmarduk"
"while i agree with this idea in principle i wondering if there would be any issues with rapid firing weapon systems such as auto cannons.another area which also needs to be looked out at either an alternative or additional changes is weapons systems need to group.a typical fleet fit tempest has 6 1400mm all firing the same ammo.there is no reason why we couldn't just have the ui group all the guns together fire once and have a multiplier applied to the damage dependent on how many guns you have grouped."
"the hell...lv's the last guy they should be keeping out of csm, esp with the upcoming midas patch.supported."

"make bumping take a ships mass into account, thats all you needfrigates going 10k ramming battleships 5km at 1000m/s is stupidthe battleship should move about 50m at about 10m/s while the frig rebounds off"
"yes the mass of the ships should be taken into consideration.it is stupid that you can bump a titan with a shuttle...."
"fine, have it re-align the you part of your statement and not the other ship. if you fly your ship towards someone like that it either needs to take collison damage or your ship needs to be bounced away and not the other ship.i have seen a tiny frigate fly up fast to a titan and make the titan \"bounce\" off it at hundreds of km a second or more.there is no skill involved and the reason ccp has said it is not an exploit is because they know it is a ton of work to rework it. im not saying make it realistic, im saying make it make sense."

"no support me this thread"
"no"
"imo, there needs to be some sort of interim solution if the mechanic will be a while changing. my friends and i are suffering under a \"ransom demand\" seemingly random war dec. some have already quit the game, and i'm seriously considering it myself. this type of event is clearly part of the current sanctioned griefing issue and if a corp is able to present proof that a war falls under this type, it should be eligible for a harassment petition. only until the mechanic can be fixed."
"great, another carebearification of eve.fantactic."

"lets try and look at it another way:if you are a taxi driver and are taken away your drivers license, don't you think you are going to get fired? you obviously can't do your job(driving around) without it."
"if a member of parliament stops sending out newsletters, do they have to resign? that seems a much closer metaphor. the forums are hardly necessary for the csm role, as evidenced by how many of you shun them frequently. they are unnecessary for internal communication, for attending meetings, for consulting with constituents, or for anything else essential. if the csm moves to a forum-based system, then this might change, but given the present system, forum access is a throw-in, not a core responsibility."
"i beg to differ.if you want an item on the agenda, you have to post on the forum. we now have our own private forum, where communication does happen. it hasn't been the case that the csm is forum-based, due to the lack of tools provided to us.the fundamental role of a csm member is to communicate. it's a 2 way communication in my mind. a ban will keep you from doing this job."
"how about this example:you continue to keep posting on the forums about the age question for csm and get a forum ban because of it (purely hypothetical ofc). would it then be fair to get kicked out csm?besides even then when the rest of csm don't vote you out would ccp still communicate to you?what if then all of the csm would resign because of that?it's all a big what if but it's better to think about it now and not when it's too late."
"the hypothetical situation is not likely to happen. you need a more likely example to make a point.but if it did happen, then several things can be done. either write to wrangler, stating the case(assuming i didn't break the rules). if he just doesn't bother, then internal affairs will have to look into how the community team does their job.however, the example is really bad and only suits to try and prove a point which in my eyes isn't valid. yes, the mods are trigger happy from time to time. but they aren't unreasonable people."
"being unreasonable isn't as black and white as you might think. the csm should at have the ability to form its own opinion about this. is ccp's change of the min age for csm reasonable? is getting banned from the forums because you lost your temper when you got trolled for months reasonable? is getting banned because of outing ccp mishaps reasonable?"
"eh, i still don't like the idea of removing csms on the basis of a forum ban (and letting other csm members vote on it either) but on the other hand if you're banned then that'll probably affect your ability to do your expected tasks, from which i can see the value of a banned csm member being diminished to the point i may prefer an alternate being put in their place anyway.in the case of a game ban i'm inclined to fully agree with an automatic removal. so, i approve, both on this aspect and primarily the fact that having some clear direction for future csms is very important too. thumb up.and to be honest i enjoyed almost every minute of it. i may not agree with some of the opinions i've seen you put forward, but your responses (and some of their charges against your opinions) often made many subjects i wouldn't have taken much interest in more engaging to read/consider and a convenient distraction from my studies too.so, what're you wearing?"
"yes, it is, now that they have explained why. of course you might not agree with them. but they listened and postponed the rule.assuming the reason one would get banned is that you broke the rule, sure. but we must assume that the troll got banned too. in either case, you can reason with the community team about your ban if you think the ban is wrong.sure. you broke the eula, so it's reasonable. and you can always petition it to a lead gm or talk to internal affairs. i don't want to get into a discussion on if the kugu case was justice or not though. lets just say i have an opinion, but it's unrelated to this specific point i'm making.reason is not a 1-way thing."
"i guess we agree on this.no system and nobody is perfect otherwise there wouldn't be the need for csm.lets take the following rule:"
"i know posting on the forums to add a topic is standard procedure, but if a csm were forum banned and still on the council, the chair would surely accept submissions by email, in-game convo, or a similar mechanism. and while i don't dispute that 2-way communication is critical, it can be done just as easily in jita local, or in most of your corp chats, as it can be in the assembly hall. i'm not saying that it'd be good to have a forum-banned csm member, even temporarily. i'm just saying that, given present methods of operation, i don't think it'd be bad enough to justify ejection."
"i support this"
"if they receive an in-game or permanent forum ban then they should be removed immediately with no exception. however for a short temporary forum ban i think they could be required to abstain from voting until their ban was lifted and one of the alternates allowed to vote in their place."
"the new forum moderation team is no more enlightened than the old. action is created by nothing more than the click of a report button, with no examination of the context of the reported post done.now, i'd agree with a review by the council of the offending posts, but that lends itself to the same silly bullying the \"moderation by report button\" lends itself to. a situation where a majority in the council can remove minority representatives is not a healthy one per se. i'm not sure if this is meant to be ironic or not. suffice to say you've broken the rules plenty, and everyone's had their fair share of forum alts attack. let's at least be honest if nothing else.:edit: to clarify the above statement before the report post crew goes into full effect. based on what i've been told and how i've seen the forum rules applied, many people on the csm have violated the rules. repeatedly. i don't think the current standards as they're applied should allow for the moderation team to have more influence than the players in determining who their representatives are. the moderation team shouldn't be choosing the representatives. the players do and if the players want to elect people who post a particular way i do not see how their judgement should override that of the voters."
"no, you cannot. i also do not think the community moderation team should be in the position of determining the player's csm candidates. especially given that forum moderation has been placed outside of the purview of the csm.if the council has no input into the actions of the moderation team then i'm astounded we would request that the moderation team have input into the makeup of the council."
"there have been thousands of posts over the years containing the \"fix lag\" mantra. for many of us it's simply become something we deal with on a day to day basis, making the best of the situation and dreaming of a day when we could click our modules in the often touted in interviews \"large fleet battles\" that many of us are engaged in, and have them actually respond within seconds as opposed to 10-15 minutes.large fleet battles are a major selling point for ccp. they are sexy. furthermore, lag is something that impacts every single player of eve, whether you be a 0.0 territorial alliance, a factional/empire war corporation or an industrialist who never leaves empire.i also realize that ccp accepts and knows that this is a problem, so a mere issue raised of \"fix lag\" isn't going to accomplish anything. what i'm proposing is that we see a commitment from ccp, as we've seen the past 2 or 3 weeks, that they will keep the players informed of the steps they're taking as regards the fight against lag. i believe that part of the continued outcry stems from a lack of communication on their part over time. this is understandable in some respects as it's certainly more exciting to be selling your new content, but nobody who plays eve today does not want to know about what's being done to rectify the performance of the game.posting 10,000 dev blogs about ambulation in a year and a few minor blurbs regarding lag isn't doing anything to pacify the mob, and in reality all i think is required is a bit more regular communication with some actual results and numbers to point to, as we had with the stackless io blog and the recent posting regarding upgraded servers.tl;dr i'd like to see frequent communication from ccp stating that this situation is being rectified, and detailing the steps the dev team is taking to combat the sources of lag. not everything needs to be out in the open as i'm sure some of it could be exploited, but at the very least a degree of communication should be had which will show that they understand this is an issue and are committed to dealing with it.while i'd love to raise a topic of \"fix lag\" i think that this is a more realistic approach, that may actually pay off."
"now this is a lag post i can fully support. communication with the players - both actual and perceived - would do a lot to alleviate many of these concerns and ease player pressure. plus, i'm naturally an inquisitive sort, so getting more info appeals greatly to me."
"i agree completely."
"yes."
"more communication from ccp concerning what has been done, what is being done and what the future plans are to attack lag are would be greatly appreciated. i support this proposal, however they also need to stay vigilant on the issue of actually fixing lag in addition to communicating what is being done about it.i consistently and frequently raise the issue of lag in massive fleet battles in hopes of keeping the volume turned up on this issue which is of a grave and pressing nature to eve. to many subscribers who play eve for many hours every month this is really issue number one. we often wonder why we are incapable of convincing ccp that without fixing lag eve's future as an un-sharded mmo is questionable."
"i am generally in love with the concept of player enabled content, and have been thinking a bit about if this can be done on ships.the basic idea is this: if i fit a ship and provide a bpo for said shiptype, i should be able to convert these two to a \"prefitted ship\" bpo. when producing on this bpo, i would then get a prefitted ship with the exact same stuff as put on my original - modules, rigs, drones and ammo.the upside: 1) the new ship bpo would have cpu and powergrid calculated on the initial creation of the bpo - thus allowing expert pilots to create good ships to be handed over to not so expert pilots who would usually not be able to use the fittings together due to cpu/power limitations.2) the prefitted ship bpo could then be researched to reduce the mineral cost of production.3) as well as providing a bpo for the ship it should be possible to provide bpo's for whatever modules you fit to it (provided you have such bpo's). doing so will add the production costs of the module rather than the module itself to the production cost.the downside: 1) as a prefitted ship it is not possible to remove any modules whatsoever. once the ship is produced it's fittings are fixed, period.2) production cost on the \"prefit bpo\" is a mineral expenditure + whatever tech i, named and tech ii modules are fitted to the original ship (unless module bpo is provided) used in creating the bpo. mineral research only affects the mineral costs of producing the ship - not the amount of modules needed.3) the pilot flying the prefitted ship would of course still be subject to the skill requirements for flying the ship/using the modules. no fitting tech ii tachies to an armageddon and handing them to a 3 day old char with absolutely no skills....the idea behind this is partly to get the various organisations out there to create bpo's for whatever ships/fighting style their organisation prefer. i would love to some day scan the market for \"bob sniper mrk 2\" or \"goonfleet hvy tackler\" ships.or how about me personally fitting an omen with a lot of basic tech i stuff, gather all the bpo's and combine then into one \"prefit bpo\" and then flooding the market with \"octstyle disposable holy light\" throw away cruisers for 7.5 mil apiece?of course, if ccp nerfs the original ship it should carry through to the prefit bpo and so possibly make it \"unfittable\" in which case it should be possible to \"unravel it\".let me know what you think."
"a cautious thumbs up for this, but i'd like to know about the strain that it would put on the database."
"while i approve of having stored settings for quick-building ships, this seems like it would break the database to no real effect. make it easier to mass-fit ships, sure, but this isn't the way."
"yeah, stored fittings would make more sense then prefitted ship bpos. i would love to see an ingame version of eft and maybe even the \"gang tool\" from that well-known site.op not approved"
"don't you know everyone in eve fits their ships terribly?i can't say i like this idea for a number of reasons.firstly, you can already use contracts to sell fitted ships. we also use an internal forum-based market system to order prefit hulls. the only advantage here is to the producer and it comes at the cost of...variety. this proposal would shoehorn you into a specific ship configuration for little benefit. when ccp changes any particular mechanic ship fittings change. that's the nature of the beast. in this case you'd be left with a crap bpo or ship that couldn't be properly readjusted. in short the resale value turns to poop.what is the producer actually producing? i'm not saying the current system is perfect, but it seems to me that what you're suggesting is a system in which a producer can merely be in the bpo copying business to acheive what now is a significant investment of time, and i'm not sure that mass-scale ship production shouldn't be a significant investement in time."
"does anyone actually use this module, or is it as useless as i think it is? it, at first glance, appears to have a nice, high jam strength until you realize a few things:it doesn't get bonuses from most shipsit costs tons of capit has a 30s cycleit doesn't actually jam anythingit doesn't work on the one thing it'd be super-usefull against (drones), since they just insta-relock.it affects your own fleet members up to 27km away give or take.this module is just horrible. there are a lot of really simple things that could be done to 'fix' this module.it doesn't get bonuses from most ships - let itit costs tons of cap - lower itit has a 30s cycle - lower itit doesn't actually jam anything - fix itit doesn't work on the one thing it'd be super-usefull against (drones), since they just insta-relock. - make it so jammed drones lose their current stance so the user has to re-attack.it affects your own fleet members up to 27km away give or take. - this would be fine if they didn't suck in every other way, tooany one or two of these would fix these fine."
"supporting my own issue, of course."
"i fully support improving the quality of the servers.there is a problem though and the problem is we need to be reasonable. if you could improve infrastructure enough that you could have say 1500 people on the same grid fighting, what's to stop 3000 people from coming in and bringing the lag back? you make it sound like removing the lag is easy when it's not. without a major leap in technology your going to have to deal with lag as people are going to bring as many as the possibly can before **** break, as unless you didn't notice... people like to win."
"agreed and supported"
"actually i heard of a pretty nice idea where instead of attacking one pos in order to get it into reinforced you had to attack five other supporting structures each on a different grid in order to get the main pos shield down. it's not impossible to make a situation where it's better to split your forces up."
"i complettly support this. on a psihological plane, is all about goals. in a social environment with a hierarchy established like is the 0.0 environment, there always be a need to concentrate brute force in order to acumulate power.the thirst for power is imperative, and this is all about 0.0 pvp warfare, even if you talk about actual pos blobs, the miriads of freighters in empire moving alliance goods, the matrix of economical products of t2 market. with this thirst in mind and with the easy way rule of all human beeings, you will see why always more people will be needed. in the end if the game mechanics will force the players to spread around systems, if game tools will allow and promote this approach of game and if the real power of sovereignity in 0.0 can be changed only when fleets will battle not only in a single solar system but in entire constelattions, maybe we can have epic battles with no or only few lag.until then the hardware evolution will always be outrunned by the numbers of players in a battle.in addition of what serenity said i would like to add the change of pipe architecture of constelations so actual travelling, tactics, strategies would not rotate around choke points.just 2 cents from a larger idea i have"
"just so people know i do actually appreciate ccp's recent work on their hardware (eve64) and software (stacklessio) architecture and i do read the dev blogs (actually i hover over them like a hawk) quite often.i recently posted this comment and these questions on a dev blog: these questions need to be answered by ccp about their ability to predict or quickly respond to the needs to switch a 0.0 system or group of systems to a stronger server node.for further information on what ccp is doing to improve performance throughout the tranquility cluster read here:eve64my node was equipped with the followinghowever, even after ccp switched m-oee8 to a dedicated intel eve64 server node and the gbc and northern coalition brought all they had to bear on the system it still crashed a horrible death so there is definitely more work to be done to improve performance for massive 0.0 fleet engagements:"
"keep up the good work ccp and eventually the dream of 600 vs 600 fleet battles without crippling lag may one day be a reality! also for all those naysayers out there that believe this is in vain because it will escalate to more pilots further straining the improved architecture - there are limits to how many pilots an alliance or power bloc can field and bring to the fight. however one day as eve grows those limits will also be exceeded and a new mmo super computing cluster will be required - ccp will need to continue to toil and burn to reach ever greater heights of space combat mmo greatness."
"i have a lot of thoughts on this particular issue. on the one hand i think it's silly to go to ccp with a \"fix lag\" issue. of course they want to fix lag. \"duh\" will be the response.on the other hand i think they haven't done a very good job of acknowledging the issue and being forthcoming about what is being done to rectify it. this leads people to continuously keep bringing it up and posting these topics and in some cases, quitting the game in disgust, which in reality doesn't benefit anyone.now, what i was originally going to propose was a request that ccp keep the players up to date on this issue. that we would pass a resolution requesting that ccp have an ongoing status statement on what's being done to combat lag and improve the situation. it certainly isn't nothing.the thing is that in the past 2 or three weeks we've had 2 different announcements regarding lag. the first was the stackless io annoucement and the second was the 64 bit server upgrade blog. i'm really not too sunshiney about asking for somehting that they may already be addressing proactively as they see both the performance of the game and their lack of communication on the subject to be detrimental.i'm going to give this bad boy a bit more thought. whatever we deliver should be constructive and useful. \"fix lag\" is neither."
"i've detailed a bit regarding what i think is a bit more realistic a response here:"
"copy from cross postmore communication from ccp concerning what has been done, what is being done and what the future plans are to attack lag are would be greatly appreciated. i support this proposal, however they also need to stay vigilant on the issue of actually fixing lag in addition to communicating what is being done about it.i consistently and frequently raise the issue of lag in massive fleet battles in hopes of keeping the volume turned up on this issue which is of a grave and pressing nature to eve. to many subscribers who play eve for many hours every month this is really issue number one. we often wonder why we are incapable of convincing ccp that without fixing lag eve's future as an un-sharded mmo is questionable.i will continue to raise \"fix lag\" as the most important issue facing eve. we all know what this means and we must continue the message to ccp on this."
"totally agree with op.also there should be consequences for losing/gaining a system. the losing side can't dock up, stuff like that..."
"i agree.... fix fw before you even think about anything else... such as alliances in fw (which would kill fw btw).but wait... the csm is debating alliances to be in fw, mainly due to the selfish personal opinion of jade trying to push her agenda. 23 supports and jade thinks that's a majority to propose the issue! when 99% of fw players oppose alliances in fw. fw is so broken, yet adding alliances deserves a csm push? where's the csm talks about fixing fw and its core mechanic first!?!?jade... that's the reason why the csm stinks."
"just to interject a bit of reality here... jade can't pass a single measure by himself. if the council raises the issue then it passes by a majority vote. i personally support alliances in fw, even if mainly because i don't support the idea of mechanics that limit gameplay to certain individuals via artificial means."
"well as is evidenced in the recent \"sugestion\" to tax npc player corp members there seems to be a real desire to have more isk sinks in eve. so i offer a counterproposal to levy a jump gate fee..graduated from 100 isk in high sec systems to 1000 isk in null sec.why? 3 very good reasons (1) it will help reduce lag a bit because when those annoying players who jump in and out of gates just to keep loading and loading the grid thereby creating tons of lag get charged for it they may slow down a bit. (2) it doesnt unfairly target one group of players (3)last but not least it addresses all those people who recently stated a real need for a new isk sink..well there you have it.."
"yup werks for me"
"much more fair than a specific forced tax on a specific group of people..supported"
"cautious support"
"hmm ok"
"maybe a tax exemption for freighter pilots ? i see many newbs setting autopilot to \"shortest way - include low-sec\""
"since this is just a troll, i'll bite.if you are going to base this on the fact it takes fuel to run that thing. why do i have to pay the same as the guy in a freighter if i am in a frig? then i guess you will have to use jb mechanics to make is work."
"she didnt mention anything about fuel..where did you get that idea.anyway i think this is a good idea."
"um sounds like a toll not a troll..but there isnt a country in the world that doesnt impose a toll somewherein there transportation system.so why not in eve? and i like the flat graduated fee rather than one based on ship size..supported"
"from the other thread she posted the idea. this is just a retaliatory response to the the taxing of npc corps.i underlined the funny parts."
"as i note in the op this is a response and if you want to characterize it as retailiation so be it.glad we share the same sense of humour.it was meant that way.but on a serious note i strongly feel this is a much more balanced and fair way of creating isk sinks..it effects all players using the gates not based on their specific game play or allegiance or non allegiance. and as mentioned it also performs other useful tasks."
"supported"
"vlandina,i view this in the same light as the the npc tax. creating isk sinks is fine. but not at the expense of game play. on a serious note however. charging in null sec makes little or no sense. if you look at it at it in a rp view, those gates are mine if own the region and the powers to be in empire has no reason what so ever to maintain them. in a game play sense it just slows down the game play and already we are having issues with fluidity of game play. one more headache piled on the never ending mundane and redundant crap just makes it less appealing. now as for my view of the npc taxation..its silly and stupid. the npc huggers not wanting to leave empire for love or money has already penalized themselves. they have cut out 90% of the game. and that is a shame. but to each and his own. when i do go through empire i see the npc guys the same way as i see the npc rats and agents. they are interactive wall art."
"we don't need to tax people for playing the game in a way we don't like, we don't need to tax them for playing the game at all, and we don't need bloody isk sinks. this is an even stupider proposal than the one it's responding to, no matter how many of the op's alts vote for it."
"implying you have some inside information on a players account info is not imho a very intelligent arguement against a very valid issue..too many sugestions that severely affect the balance and quality of eve game play have in some measure been supported by some csm's(and no doubt there alts). if you dont support npc taxes rally your player base..if you dont support this issue do the same..but pretending you have info you do not (and should not have) is outrageous."
"0/10"
"i support this proposal, but only if it includes docking fees and ship-type-specific jump fees. goodbye freighter profits. also, it should be the same for all space, but increase in proportion to the number of people in system. base fee should be 10k, raising by 1% per person in local (cumulative). goodbye jita/motsu/rens/<insert laggy place here>. oh yeah, and 0.0 alliances should be able to change the tax from players if they want, but it should always come out of the alliance wallet anyway (jump tax for the alliance anyone?).btw, nice alts i assume that you are opposed to npc tax because you're running 5 npc corp chars, probably farming missions all day.edit: and yes, i realise the irony of posting this with my alt, but tbh this thread doesn't deserve responses from mains. let the alts be with their kind"
"in case it's not obvious, i was mocking, not stating with knowledge - a bunch of corpless people i've never seen around here before posting unanimous support in relatively quick succession look like alts to me. it is of course possible that they're not, but it seems unlikely. as for the issue, you're proposing that we bleed the poor, annoy the rich, and deflate a currency that's not suffering from inflation. you'll pardon me if i vote against it."
"do a search and you'll find i(mara) belong to a corp..i dont advertise it so those who might not like my corp wont automaticaly flame the topic..vladina is vladina i am me.."
"more and more alliances are requiring its pilots to no longer use missile boats for combat. all of the missile based ships are almost worthless in fleet fights because it takes too long to reach targets and either the target is already dead or warped off before the missiles hit.half of the caldari ships are worthless because of this as we are told fly a gun based ship or ewar. give caldari more gun based ships or fix the missile issue."
"as long as fleet fights happen at long range, this is inevitable and unfixable. well, you could fix it if you wanted missiles to have effectively zero flight time under normal circumstances, but that's not an acceptable solution. my advice to you is either to figure out a way to get your torp raven in close(like, say, use it in a small fight, where it's very effective), or fly a scorpion or rokh. you have gunships, and they all have range bonuses for you, the problem is that nobody likes them. i'd like to see the nature of fleet fights change so that more play styles are viable, including missile ships at close range. but even if it doesn't change, this is a problem that affects exactly four ships(raven, typhoon, phoenix, naglfar), two of which are entirely usable and the other two of which are having their fundamental problem addressed in other threads. it's hardly a balance-breaker."
"missile boats in fleet is viable. however you have to fit a role like everyone else. drakes are decent anti-support and not often targeted first because it is usually a waste of dps at the start of the fight.cerbs are actually great anti-support. high dps, very fast missile speed. scorps, bb's and falcons are your e-war strength and i do not know of one fc that does not appreciate their presence on the field unless you have to deal with them.rohks are awesome snipers. just need the training.caldari has some pretty decent boats for fleet. just need to understand the roles.there is a trade off with missiles. you don't miss and you maintain a consistent dps on your target. however the trade off is that it takes a while to get there. you just have to think of positioning and how you can be the most effective, pick your targets. and start shooting the tertiary targets first."
"more gun boats? what, like the eagle, moa, ferox, rokh, cormorant? there's a caldari gunboat in every shipclass. but really, missiles are bad for fleet, sure, but they have their place still. it's not like a rokh does a bad job of being a gunship."
"misiles are bad? /me looking at sacrilage,cerberus,rapier,crow ........."
"caldari misile issue will be fixed with nano nerf. they will be brought more inline with guns. ( higher signatures ion misiles), and better reduction of damage vs misiles."
"yea i \"think\" he was talking about having a raven spewing cruise missiles from the north forty. and having them take too long to actually hit what you had targeted."
"support... double all missile speed and explosion velocity.done"
"if you're in a raven, just shoot the secondary. this is difficult?edit: or nail the hostile falcons. hard to argue with a 3000-point pure em damage alphastrike vs falcons."
"i rarely fly ravens, despite them being quite good anti-support, as all too often i'm flying falcon/onyx/rokh/eagle instead."
"yeah well i was referencing missiles. the only boost caldari missile ships could even think of asking for right now are missile velocity/explosion velocity scripts for tracking computers. pic wants to double missile velocity? lol... 20km/s cruise missiles?"
"glad to hear your not standing again. one less corrupt member."
"jade actually covered most of this but...this has been raised with ccp, and their pov is that listing accomplishments sets a bad precedent. i personally don't agree with that pov, and i've said that to them. hopefully this will change.the irrelevent side chatter happens between meetings and topics under discussion (toilet breaks, food breaks etc.). it has no impact on the time spent on topics.no the lack of transparency of what the csm has discussed with ccp and it's outcome/timeline to implementation is a big issue. as jade pointed out, all the meeting records are publicly available from the csm, i have a large issue with the lack of support from ccp (hosting of minutes, lack of forum until very recently, 3rd party providers of communications) which are all helping to cause people to question what the csm has achieved and whether ccp actually cares about the csm due to only the csm people disseminating information which people like yourself consider biased or corrupt.it's a rock and a hard place situation - csm posts stuff, and people scream bias and corruption. ccp post stuff and people scream that they aren't listening to csm. we need something to bridge that gap. that's my transparency issue."
"makes you wonder why ccp e-mail surveys to people who gave up their accounts and is rather reluctant when it comes to communicating with csm."
"this?"
"i have used them with corp members"
"as usual ccp are doing a masangsoft on us and just going the communist china route of:ignore, ignore, ban, ignore, do it our way pr gtfo1sec they dont give a flying **** you still pay right!?only way to make these corporate ***** actually do anything is to take some money away or go get a cyno in polaris and assualt magicland and stationcamp them all until we get banned"
"i support the reimbursement system being examined simply because i'm personally biased: i've had a (comparatively) substantial loss refused reimbursement inspite of a much smaller loss easily reimbursed and both eventuated in virtually the same circumstances. consequently i more inclined to think that a (comparatively) substantial loss is likely to be little more than an isk sink, even when you have a credible case against that.also that the logs are more likely to be 350 ft long and made of solid oak than they are to resolve your problems."
"c'mon take off that tin foil hat and cancel your subscription to paranoia weekly. we experience the same lag, desyncs and other problems you do. we just don't whine about it. when it happens stay calm, get everyone to try logging back in or whatever and if you lose a ship take it on the chin."
"this is not about lag, this is about poor customer service. currently, the fleet battle policy seems to be used as an excuse not to provide customer service. losses that have nothing to do with a fleet battle not being reimbursed because there may be a tenuous connection between the loss and a battle. stuck petitions being refused, and players left staring at the 'entering game' screen or being stuck in a jumpbridge jump that doesn't complete, because gms will not intervene until hostilities have ceased are another such example of appalling, atrocious customer service (or lack thereof).how can a player who cannot log in be considered part of a fleet battle? how can a player who has initiated a jump bridge jump and who can no longer do anything other than wait for it to complete be considered part of a fleet battle? yet still the fleet battle policy is used to deny basic customer service - namely, to get the player 'unstuck' and enable them to continue playing the game that they pay for.to receive a copy/paste flat refusal in such a situation is an insult, tbh.i think the fleet battle policy and reimbursement policy should be reviewed, and petitions responded to and granted/refused on a case by case basis."
"tower management is terrible. overhauls for permissions, security and operation are all needed."
"hello communityi love the eve community and the game, and i've wanted to be able to put forth the ideas and concerns that we players have needed to be voiced.i ran the first time some months ago trying to fulfill this purpose. well it is that time again, and while some of the ideas that we players have been desiring have been voiced, i still think more can be done, if elected, my primary purpose will be what you the players are worried about, what you want to see done.without sounding too cliche, i want to work for you the eve community, as it is you who make this game what it is. if given the opportunity to work on the council, you will be my focus.so i hope i can have your support come election day. please feel free to send me an eve mail in game to kaiden exeider, and i will be happy to answer any questions or concerns.thanks for those who supported me the first time and i hope i can have your continued support this second time.hope to hear from you and have your support.-kaiden exeider"
"hello,what changes do you represent and what do you stand for? how do you know what people want? what are the current concerns you think are important and ccp needs to hear about?maybe you can explain this in this tread or link to your blog. thanks in advance.-esiq"
"well first and foremost i would like to fix things that may not necessarily be 'issues' as much as convenience things.for example, a lot of people have been worried about a skill queue, balancing between keeping people from farming to allowing people queue up skills to be trained so there is no missed training time.the fact is character farming will still happen regardless of a skill queue, and without it, it punishes the legit players. i will try to push through the idea of a skill queue.also, something else that would be very good, especially for those of us who can't log in to change their skill, it would convenient to be able to change your skill through the website.for example, let's say your at work and you can't load up eve on the machine, or your at school and your school's firewall won't let you log in. it would be good to be able to change your skill through your account on the website.another thing is clone vat bays for capital ships, you can jump clone to it, but you can't jump clone from it. i think people who use these bays, like rorqual pilots and such, i would think it would work much like a medical bay. this should be fixed.also, i would like to push forward the fuel pellet idea that was posited by ccp greyscale, where the pos fueling being streamed down, something to help reduce the logistical thinking to something more manageable so you won't be confused if you don't have 1 out of umpteen things you have to keep track ofthe liquid ozone and heavy water both serve a distinct purpose, so they shouldn't be changed. but theres no explicit design need though for towers themselves to burn six different fuel types (racial isotopes, enriched uranium, mechanical parts, coolant, oxygen and robotics) at a constant rate. the key point is that we create four racial fuel pellets, which replace the isotopes and npc commodities in the starbase fuel bay. they are manufactured, using blueprints, from the relevant isotope type and npc commodities. you then just pop in heavy water, liquid ozone and fuel pellets, and the starbase runs as normal.another thing that i personally would like to see is a class of vessel that will fit between industrial and freighter, like a cargo hauler or something to that effect. this has already been posted by the current csmanother thing is i've heard the jumpclone timer should be lowered from 24 hours to 12. the idea is that based on playing habits most people might play anywhere from 4 - 8 hours in a play session, as someone who uses a jump clone as a lot of people do, i've noticed after a hard day of playing or working the mining fields, when your winding down, you look at the timer and there might be 13 - 16 hours left on it, and it seems to me 12 of those hours is just excessive.i've often asked random players that use jump clones, given the option, what amount of time would they think is reasonable. ive heard 8 hours, 16 hours, 18 hours, but more then most 12 seemed to be the magic number among people.so i would like to push this up for people and get a resolution on it.this is just a small number on the list of things i am tallying up, things that people are saying \"man i wish this was fixed.\" or \"why doesn't this work like...\"mainly, what i've listed is things that i have heard from people in my personal experience. but if elected i would like to create a special email, that people could mail me things, so i can know on a real time basis what the current attitude and climate is about particular issue, or a general consensus of what is the idea or feel of the direction of the game is. first and fore most i want to be able to say that i am connected into the pulse of the people of the eve universe and not some bureaucrat, or politician that only worries about the people paying the campaign finances, or the lobbyists."
"i don't want to be that kind of councilman, i want to know what people are thinking, i want to know what people want. since you the player is the one shelling out cash for this game, your concerns should be foremost.maybe that's a naive way of thinking, but its an honest way to think, and though i'm sure i will get flamed for it, i know in the end, if i am able to fix a third or even half of your concerns, then i'll call it a job well done.-kaiden exeider"
"how do you plan to keep in touch with the community, and how will you insure that you deliver what the players want?since i'm in the csm and try to represent the players to the best of my abilities instead of furthering a personal agenda, i know how difficult it can be to get in touch with the players that do not post on the forums, and to read through the whining and altposting that occurs here.what are your plans in this regard?as second part, do you have what it takes? can you write quality documents, and dedicate at least one day a week for meetings and many hours every day to read the forums and talk to players, answer your mail, appear on the tv/radio, be interviewed, and so on? being a csm is a job and requires a lot of effort, do you have, say, 20 hours available per week to serve the community?and as last question, what is your background in the game and in real life, what is your playstyle, and how do you plan to approach other playstyles that are not your own? take me for example, i've hardly ever set foot in 0.0 before this whole csm business, but once i became part of the csm, i suddenly had to vote on issues regarding 0.0 sov, capital ships, black ops, and many more things. i'd say at least half the issues were issues i never had given much thought. no matter what your area of expertise is, how do you plan to deal with issues outside your comfort zone, especially if the players want you to deal with them all of the sudden?sorry for the difficult questions, but at least it prepares you for what is to come ps: skillqueue has already been through the csm."
"welcome to the rat race!ankh already beat me to mentioning that skill queue has already been raised. i'd note as well that i believe simplification of fueling was raised as well via the flogging the dead horse proposal in assembly hall."
"that is correct, at least you did a good job explaining the issues with pos fuelling in iceland, to the devs directly."
"no, i like it. well thanks for taking your time and explaining what you stand for. i'm sure it will make your case stronger. good luck with the campaign!- esiq"
"well i think we should look at the fact, that i am already thinking like you do, as evident by what your saying as some of these issues i have listed here is already int he process of being worked on.i am a writer and going to school for game design, going to get a bachelor of science degree when its all said and done, so as far as expertise, i am being taught not just how to program, or create animations, but also to design games from the ground up. basically i am being groomed on basically being a dev, and maybe one day i will be.i read the forums everyday, specifically the game design section, and read what people are saying. i log in everyday, if even to just check my mail. i would even go so far as to say i wish there was a csm meeting weekly. as far as appearances, tv/radio, you name it, where ever the opportunity to speak and present, i will take it. i would like to say i am perpetually \"on-call\" for the community.as far as play style, i am an industrialist, but the people that i have surrounded myself with are of many different play styles and have a constant barrage of issues that are important to them. and many a time i have wished i was able to help them with it.i plan on having a dedicated email for both internal use ie for csm members to contact me, and external use , for the public to contact me. and maybe even a blog to constantly keep people up to date with whats going on, and whats being discussed.henry ford was quoted saying \"i may not know how to build a automobile, but if you give me 5 minutes, i can contact those i employ who do.\"my meaning is, that even though i do not know everything about eve, i do know a multitude of people from many different backgrounds, and points of view, and i have access to that. so if i don't know it, i know how to find out. i am constantly exploring eve related websites of both corps and just people who have information about the game that is relevant to the topic that i am needing to research about.though there is no substitute for experience, i would like to believe that i am prepared to serve if given the opportunity.i hope this answers your questions, ankh-kaiden"
"the result of discussion in at least ten different monstrous threads regarding sov and also a place to talk about potential big-picture changes to 0.0 in the context of steering the devs in a direction for great justices. all of them.the triangle of concerned parties:0.0 alliancesinterests are enhancing the value of 0.0, easing the logistical nightmare, making sov more meaningful, better sov warfare. concerns are that increasing 0.0 volatility will undermine an already shaky and kinda meaningless 0.0.not boblesser alliances who find the \"get mowed down by 100 dreads\" nomad lifestyle kinda...\"i pay for this game too.\" interests are lowering the barrier to 0.0 entry, increasing viability for a hundred pilot alliance to pull hundred pilot weight, and increasing volatility such that cap fleets are not the sole measure of sov projection. concerns are that increasing the strength of 0.0 holders will skew the balance of power in favor of super alliances.empirepirates, carebears, and hisec bling-blingers. concerns are, like the not-bob's, that increasing the income and prominence of 0.0 will simply squelch empire play such that empire becomes a relative slum even for isk farmers.we are not so differentcompromise point #1compromise goal is to lower 0.0 access barrier and provide avenues for the not-bob's to assert their presence while at the same time lifting the position of 0.0 powers and providing avenues for more meaningful sov.make 0.0's biggest income generator accessible from day one with minimal investment; then make the form of that income useful only to 0.0 powers with established infrastructure. 0.0 wealth will be easily accessible to all, leveling the playing field at a very nascent stage, while at the same time leaving a hierarchical source of economic power less exposed and more to the tastes of large alliances. raw materials through mechanisms are responsive at the sub-cap level while production can be controlled via mechanisms that are responsive at the cap level. implementation proposal will follow at some point.compromise point #2compromise goal is to address the issue of poor sov combat as well as providing a more versatile fight broker that scales better with engagement size, provides impact via tactics, simplifies process of sov, and gives ccp more possibilities to distribute load in the future.concensus reached in a thread fathered by goonswarm's fahtim was that the proper sov instrument will be a multi-grid solution based at planets. system will create simultaneous combat at multiple grids that will amplify the affects of better mobility and force distribution. planet base system is simpler and more consistent than moons. multi-grid solution also adds more balance by reducing effectiveness of pure blobbing.compromise point #3compromise goal is to preserve the place of empire while allowing 0.0 to flourish.similar to cap-ship production, add new facilities and hulls to further provide a sink for 0.0 income as well as increasing the appeal of 0.0 without overwhelming empire player productivity with the excess wealth of a 0.0 flush with bling.structures that form the basis of utilizing productivity gained from structures in point #1 should be expensive, flashy, a point of uberness for alliances that make the leap, responsive solely to cap threats via sov mechanisms in point #2 , and provide unique goods to 0.0 holders that are not marketable in empire, thus protecting empire economy from the end result of that income buff. implementation proposal to follow at some point.please discuss these compromise solutions for 0.0 improvement in broad terms and attempt to direct discussion towards wide-reaching aspects."
"as with most of these types of threads, some very interesting points and proposals are raised. your points 1 and 3 - get resources of some kind from 0.0, usable primarily/only in 0.0, and make them the primary profit source - lead to an interesting idea. two end products of the type you describe already exist - capital ships and pos/outposts. obviously, it would overthrow a large variety of the existing economy if those were to be transitioned to something other than minerals and cash as their source, given that both are large-scale sinks of their respective types - much as inflation isn't a problem now, it could be if you removed large cash sinks without making corresponding adjustments - but it might be possible. what if, for example, all poses, outposts, and components thereof were made from blueprints, and those blueprints used minerals sourced primarily/only in 0.0 space? you'd throw the economy for a loop in the short term, though i suspect people would stockpile to bridge the gap, but it might yield the sort of situation you describe. replace a large portion of the cash bounties from belt rats with component drops, which means the primary source will be 0.0(although empire can source it at dramatically reduced efficiency) and that should cancel out the loss of a cash sink i propose. ratting suddenly becomes the only source for 0.0 infrastructure, which might shift some emphasis to small-gang raids, and which yields the desired result of making the raw source open to just about everybody while leaving the manufacturing closed. to make the loop complete, make the only feasible way to produce poses be an outpost, and the only feasible way to produce an outpost be via poses - say, ludicrous time requirements, with -90% time modifiers on factories of the appropriate type(or, if you're feeling really mean, a similar material modifier). you can bootstrap your way up from empire stations, but you won't want to. as ever, i'm just pulling things from my posterior when i muse about 0.0 overhauls. but i'm curious about other people's thoughts."
"thank you sir ^_^i believe it is possible to avoid the inflation issue entirely by decoupling the new 0.0 production from the empire economies. i mulled over this a lot in the acdc thread i was working on, and concluded that 0.0 goods will never inflate or deflate because all that will happen is demand will grow and subside. i summed up the philosophy in the slogan, \"moar ships. moar pew pew.\" we all saw what happened when the drone regions flooded the market with nocx and other high ends. imagine if instead drone minerals were only useful in 0.0. they would be produced in 0.0, consumed in 0.0, and balanced by the pew pew supply and demand relationship. (just a for instance.)a lot of the philosophical base i'm working off of was the result of the thought process in the acdc thread. i didn't take that particularly seriously, as apparent in the no-holds-barred uber abstracted writing style, but got some surprisingly smart replies. (please come again!)at current, 0.0 looks a lot like what i would call the \"salary man model,\" where mechanics that resemble work are used to limit things like scope creep and single alliance domination. after all the thought process in the acdc thread, i'm aiming to shift to what i call the \"nba superstar model,\" where the high capabilities of players are balanced instead by each other. overall, a shift from the game itself slowing us down to more player driven limiting factors.the reason why i've chosen these two monikers is that the salary man works to build what he has while the superstar is paid by the league revenues. we can simulate space as a place for up-by-the-bootstraps self made men or as a giant sports franchise where good players get paid a lot more and while bench warmers make less, nobody spends time grinding.one of the big things i have in mind is the idea of self-constructing production structures for raw materials. ask yourself, if we need pos's to determine sov etc, why are the players expected to grind just to come up with the income to set up/maintain the mechanics necessary to have sov warfare and 0.0 production? it should not fall on the shoulders of players to slave away to build the game they have come to play.as far as where the loop should exist, i'm imagining something like this: you step into 0.0, win a few skirmishes to get left alone, drop some eggs that are about 50m a piece. add water. come back in a few days (while fending off counterattacks) and it's a production platform for asteroids or moons etc and is going to earn you 500m per planet or so.the goods exist in some kind of \"mineral formation\" that requires extraction at a higher level facility, which requires sov and more time/money to build. this produces a more generalized product which is used for basic \"space bling.\" or it can be sold on up the chain to the mega-alliance with a fully established research facility so they can produce their limited quantity, faction-esque space bling.the idea is to make the basic component of this space bling accessible at the minimal level of presence in a system. the production platforms should be at the sub cap level and get blown up and rebuilt at a fast pace. however, to keep this huge source of dynamic 0.0 from completely destabilizing large alliances and forcing them to run all over space, make the producers of these raw materials beholden to powers with established infrastructure, as 0.0 is beholden to empire right now.as far as making pos's or anything only producible at well established 0.0 facilities, i'm working against any mechanics that raise the barrier to getting into 0.0. the basic eggs etc should be seeded in empire and always fairly cheap. they exist so we can have things to fight over, not have things to grind for."
"you might want to change not bob to not mob : o potherwise your going to come off as a whiner to some people...might as well say not goon or something at that rate.it could be any number of alliances with there numbers... call me picky... but the message is still the same.but your points are valid... the mob mentality is what i think of when looking at point 2."
"gramyreall three of these compromises will leave 0.0 much better off for everyone, mega-alliances fully included.i doubt goons enjoyed the seventy-something moons in q-t or any other system. same goes for everyone. switching to a planetary sov instrument is a huge gain. as far as the \"mob mentality\" i'm not sure what you're getting at. i'll try to answer, but please elaborate further. the instrument, as developed in fahtim's thread, would work to the advantage of any well organized fleet of any size compared to a jumbled blob of any size.nicer structures would be an immeasurable benefit. right now we're relegated to fighting over space-sticks that give rights to a flag on a map or an outpost that looks like every other outpost and will get named something ridiculous because nobody really cares. i've taken to heart what darius had to say and my own experience in 0.0 as far as lack of gold at the end of the pos rainbow.giving large alliances a more pivotal role in the income stream of 0.0 without requiring them to worry about every little moon should be a welcome change as well. under my proposed compromise, losing a few of the new production streams at the base level won't immediately or detrimentally affect a large alliance that can benefit from the steady supply of raw materials any small-time raiders will have to offload.with all those benefits to large alliances, i hope the few hyper-sensitive pilots who get their feelings mistakenly hurt can get over it."

"iused to have three accounts on the go,(training alt for rorqual).the rorqual been made low sec only, and the the credit crunch. has made me put that account in stasis so to speak.anybody else changed their game because of world events n.b. read on msn iceland maybe bankrupticeland agreed to adopt sweeping powers over banks on monday as its financial system tottered, its currency plunged 30 percent and a leading agency cut its credit ratings.the small country's financial stature had swelled in recent years as its banks expanded overseas, investors took large positions in its high-yielding currency and foreign firms poured money into local projects."
"i don't have time to get into a proper economic analysis of this right now(wait a few hours), but the fact that the rl isk has fallen by 1/4 against the euro will do wonderful things for ccp's bottom line - they just got all their icelandic employee salaries cut by 1/4 compared to their income streams."
"as i read more information about what's happening to iceland right now, i'm struck by just how much of a cluster**** the world banking system is right now. this is, of course, the same thing that's been striking me since i heard about the lehman/merill/aig/fannie/freddie collapses and the associated bout of temporary insanity the financial sector underwent. (seriously, t-bills earning 4 bp per annum, at the same time as the cds rate on t-bills quintupled to 30 bp per annum? insanity.) i still have trouble believing that something as blindingly obvious to anybody who looked as \"houses are overpriced right now\" could blow up in the world's face this badly. thank you, fannie and freddie, for the gifts you have brought us with regard to the iceland situation specifically, the banks of the world are currently engaging in the first recoded run upon themselves, because of a catastrophic loss of trust among all involved meaning that banks are sitting on their own money instead of loaning it interbank, which is why libor has done such silly things recently. oddly, this hasn't hit customers much, since a good credit risk is still a good credit risk, but it's hitting banks like a sledgehammer, since they're all deeming each other to be poor credit risks. icelandic banks have the misfortune of being based in a country that can't bail them out of deep water even if they wanted to, and so the government is stepping in in advance to secure sources of credit other than banks. as for your comment about what effects it's having on eve players, i suspect you'll see a rise in gtc prices(as more people want to avoid spending extra/any money on their entertainment budget), and a drop in the number of alt accounts, but really no effect on main accounts - people tend to cut their rudimentary entertainment budget(be it mmos, movies, or booze) last in times of financial distress, because it takes their mind off it."
"how does the worth of isk effect my spending on eve?"
"it doesn't, unless you're paying for your account with gtcs because you don't have the cash for it."
"just make conquerable stations and outposts launch sentry guns as they are in empire (nerfed a little) that are configurable in aggrono gate guns no gate guns!!!"
"i can not see the reasoning behind this proposal. it can't be for defense- especially if you are proposing sov 3 or 4 to have them...any alliance with that sov won't be needing gate guns...it would also make it more difficult for small gangs and solo 0.0 players to travel about in 0.0 space. there should, imo, be some encouraging reasons to do such activities rather than sit in empire space all the time.take care,arithron"
"the problem with the current system of popular placement of topics is that as per the rules the bar was set higher than the interested and engaged portion of the playerbase could hope to achieve. that bar will be lowered in the next cycle. having the bar set so high meant that in order for any topic to even make it to the council causes had to be championed by the council. if they were not there'd be very little for the council to discuss at all.we also have to remember that we do elect csm representatives. what you have to keep in mind when electing a representative is that you're electing a vote. you're also electing a voice that can champion any issue they like, which should give you a bit more pause for thought when considering whom you are voting for.ultimately i think that in a perfect world the representatives would be championing both their own causes and those of the community. i've personally voted multiple times for items i felt were quite silly. i voted positively for the items because they did not have any negative repurcussions i could anticipate on the way i and my constituency choose to play eve. why should i vote down something that will bring joy to someone else if it doesn't impact me in any negative fashion?hell i've voted for things that have impacted me in a negative fashion simply because i was able to see that they were better for the game. that's just a part of the tough choices you have when choosing whom to cast your vote for. i should think at the very least you'd be looking for someone who didn't just champion your causes, but also that you'd take into consideration whether or not they could be trusted to exercise reasoned judgment in cases where the items presented were not personally of interest to them. believe it or not, there will be a lot of times where your chosen representative will have no opinion, positive or negative, on the item on the table, but their yes or no vote is required."
"hello all,in general, i think the nano nerf is a bad thing. it was only rumored to be included in one of the trinity expansions, and we saw the alloyed tritanium bars market take a nose-dive because of it.my solution would be this: have webs operate a bit differently. momentum should still be a factor, but it should be less of a factor than it is now. if you're going at 3km/s and get webbed, you can usually break it without breaking a sweat.the reduction thing can be changed as well, so that top speed is not cut as greatly, but the momentum thing should be looked at. from my experience with pvp (nano and non-nano), this seems to be the hinge point.i feature an option for smaller deployables on my webpage here, but generally this does seem like the way to go. as far as the industrial side, i've had other ideas that i have yet to post on my website, but will post it soon."
"that is right. i am running for csm.as a csm member i will bring change. change is what we need.i will also fix the current financial crisis (tm).a vote for me is a vote for change."
"screw that, vote for me and i'll vote nay on everything that comes up in csm, vote for me is a vote that eve is good as it is ps. i'm not really running for csm(it's a totally useless bunch anyway) but you can go for it and use same agenda as above for mere 1 billion isk."
"lol, you can put lipstick on a pitbull..."
"a nuance i think. maybe not puppets but certainly the sort of pr buffer zone.by the looks of things... the information available to me i am about 2/3s familiar. meaning i am reasonably familiar. plus my ignorance is only put forth in the case that something the csm actually did something which created change. my being familiarness has nothing to do with the pr buffer that which is the csm. it's an undeniable fact.ok? not that any of that really matters.duh?you can view anything any way you like. doesnt bother me.you make the assumption that i dont see them that way also? in reality this is true. but they have limited resources and tons of change ideas. features forum gets loads of suggests everyday. someone has to be there to say no.as we kind of established in this thread. there is no conduit from csm to ccp. features forum vs csm forum is exactly the same thing. ccp does what they do. when ideas dont get into the game... it's kind of the csm voting no now. instead of ccp saying no.i propose something to the csm.vote on something absolutely ridiculous. like allowing supercaps into high sec and allowance to use dd in high sec. then submit that to ccp. see what happens. you will get told no. anything ccp does change that might coincide with csm is just coincidence."
"your \"test\" is stupid. the csm is not a decision-making body, it's an advisory body. if your doctor tells you to walk for an hour every day, you probably do it, but if he tells you to walk for 24 hours every day, you get a new doctor, no matter how much you may trust the advice of doctors in the abstract. the csm's role is to shift focus, to raise counterarguments, and to emphasize that the players as a whole really want something instead of just a few vocal forum whiners. it is, of necessity, subtle, because ccp can't give them direct power. that does not mean that they don't have power, it merely means that you don't get to see them exercising it over the short term. if you want them to be able to stand up and proclaim that they forced ccp to make the game free, or something equally nonsensical, then you're going to be disappointed. if, however, you understand that ccp really does have the best interests of the game at heart, that they really do want to hear the imput of the players, and that they really are (eventually...oh god, so eventually) going to do what they say they're going to do, then you'll understand why the csm exists, what its role is, and why it matters."
"yes i said the test is stupid/ridiculous. that's the point.so they do have power. could you please post an example of where they were using this power? oh right that really isnt possible.nope. i want just 1 example of them changing ccp mind as it were.i'd love to link you a video of the privateers(alliance who kept over 50 wardecs constant all the time) were using a nanodomi with nos and ogre2s and a nanophoon. then compare that to todays stuff.every single bit of that has been nerfed. the torps on the phoon no longer fly 75km. the bs nanos arent anything like that anymore. the domi nos is changed.all these things have been changed because forum whiners got big whine threads going.now go look in assembly hall. any threads which only get 2 posts in it wont even get mentioned at the csm. the big whine threads are the ones which get csm attention. then they vote yes or no. ccp reads assembly hall. they can decide to make change without csm voting. csm for all i care could vote no on everything and then see change and oh wait..."
"my point was that it doesn't illustrate anything. testing via ludicrousness(aka reductio ad absurdum) is fine in many cases, but this isn't one of them. your test would only be meaningful if ccp did it on the csm's advice - in other words, if they were as powerful as you seem to want them to be. unfortunately, we don't have a lot of responses from ccp just yet, what with the limited time in iceland and the slow release schedule on the second submission. thus, i can only point you here, here, here, here, and here for examples of things that the csm apparently changed ccp's opinion on at least somewhat. one of the changes has even been implemented, being the one that required the least programming work. yeah, but those torps did 2/3 the dps of the current ones. overall, i think that change was for the better. battleships shouldn't be usefully nano-able, and the old nosses were too strong by far, meaning that those changes were good too. nonetheless, you rather illustrate my point here. prior to the csm, ccp had no useful quantitative metric for determining what players thought, and so they used forum static as a proxy. now they have a real broad-based measurement scheme - the csm elections - and can make information judging by what the representatives of some ten thousand of the players decide, rather than what some ten dozen talk about. or do you think that eve general is a better proposal mechanism for game changes than the csm?"
"the new csm won't be rolling in before late november. don't worry.we discussed this with ccp last weekend, so there should be an official minutes on this issue sometime soon. i have no idea when though."
"cool ... thanks"
"on the 11th we will be having the (hopefully) last csm-ccp meeting for this round. we have issues which weren't discussed inside our window of oppertunity with ccp last weekend, so it will be next weekend.to be fair against ccp, the last month or two has been the conference season(i for one spent a weekend far away from home, due to my attendance in one of the said conferences). ccp obviously sent their employees there. this means that people like noah(ccp hammer) weren't available during the weekends after the initial response. thus, it had to be post-poned till these 2 weekends.prior to the meeting we had saturday, we had some very interesting discussions(and lots of absurd jokes) on how to thrust forward csm and take it to the next level. dr. eyjog, greyscale and hammer(head) especially seemed very enthusiastic about csm, which was really nice.so i would certainly not give up hope. the wait is over very soon hopefully. sadly, when coordinating these kinds of things, not only with 7+ csm members, but also a large company like ccp, it's bound to be a slow process. but that's just the way it is."

"i've changed my mind from what i said in my last post. i'd prefer dual skill training because, unlike the other systems, it also reduces the problems new players have with learning skills* by allowing players an easy way to balance it. just keep a learning skill in the second slot until you run out.though when i think about it, i would regularly be able to make use of up to maybe 4 skills training simultaneously. any more than that i won't make much use of. naturally if i'm training n skills, they all train at 1/n speed. but 2 skills at a time is enough.*do i train for new items now (screwing myself in the long run), or train learning skills (making myself bored in the short term)."

"i would have thought that 20,000 years from now, or whenever eve is set, that a technology would have been developed that makes bumping into another ship/'roid/station irrelevant, and not damaging.nice idea, but way too 21st century for eve. ab"
"yes mass and speed needs to be taken in to account when bumping. keep the bumping until something is done to station games or anything that justify bumping now. i don't see that happening, since webbers will be soon losing some effectiveness and ramming people is realistic way to prevent them from escaping.as for collision damage no, never, not in a million years. anyone thinking it needs to answer the following question. does collision damage count as aggression? if yes does concord get involved? propably no since otherwise concord would be the biggest griefer in the game. just park a noobship on a freighters path and collect the loot after concord delivers quick justice to the aggressor. even without concord response it's not hard to envision that players would force carebears to accidentally aggro them. autopiloting anything anywhere would be out of the question, so maybe there should not be aggro from collisions. this would propably introduce a new and funny gank where higsec pirates gangram people to death and concord doesn't react, how realistic would that be? you could avoid some of these problems by implementing hard limits how low your armor/structure can fall, but that would not be realistic, so why change one unrealistic mechanic for another."
"mass is already taken into effect when it comes to speed. your ship will not be knocked off alignment if a ship the size of a frig impacts you at 6km/s. i don't know where you've been bumping, but i have never seen a ceptor sucessfully bump anything bigger than a cruiser. i will grant that bumping is a rather cheep tactic, but so is dockwar, and so are many many other ways of screwing your fellow man in eve. i too would like to live in a fantasy world where bs fights happened outside of stations, and neither side docked, logofski was impossible, and pvp was king, but i don't see how stopping bumping will alter this. if the problem is that small ships should not bump big ships, then this problem is already addressed. they don't."
"risk/reward.jf offer massive reward over industrials, which carry less, but are infinitely more risky. if you let them cyno into high sec, then its going to be almost entirely riskless. just deal with the fact that your uber hauling ship isn't ultimate, and untouchable, and give us lowsec pirates something to shoot at. maybe you should make some friends to defend it, and plan ops around it instead of making it the kind of thing you can do at any time, because your on with all your cyno alts."

"@ dex timorthx for your reply. i really appreciate such postings, and you made a good point as well. though, some of your assumptions are not correct. let me explain:1) i don't have a particular problem with recruiting. as many posters have stated before,"
"while i definetly empathise with much of your sentiment still i feel you are incorrect suggesting that npc corp members are immune from consequences..thats what concorde is for and ccp has finaly addressed some of the issues people had with that. perhaps if this plan had sufficient leverage for newer players..lets say no longer than 6 months and perhaps those who continualy hop in and out of npc cors..but again by imposing such limits you are presenting ccp with a lot of headache and possibly to the point they would just reject the idea as a whole..but i got to say this..i have rarely been hassled much by npc characters so again this could just be seen as a way to hinder new players and a futile attempt to prevent use of alts. not sufficient reason imho to make such a complex change."
"nay, because it's ccp, and quality of gms and cms are sloppy at best. and besides it should not be up to the above to decide over csm. ps. who got banned, the goonswarm guys?"
"me. not to insinuate that it was the cause of this thread in any way, but i wouldn't wish anyone's removal from the council for the two heinous posting crimes of:1) a \"yo mama\" joke on caod. -"
"this is not true. jade has had a full permanent forum ban in the past and was allowed to participate. there was a cut off period, where, if you had had a ban that was not due to an eula violation or \"egregious violation of the forum rules\"[not an exact quote] you were given amnesty. this amnesty carried over into the csm process.re: darius. oftentimes they will not discuss it with the person in question either. i have received warning and other moderation and not once heard back asking for clarification or protesting the decision."
"full permanent bans ain't what they used to be.you must be an insane forum ***** to think such a statement. i read the ah and jpsc and a post by the csm is a rarity, not the standard. communication from csm delegates? ahahahahahahahahahaha. csm can't do their job without posting on the forums? you overestimate the power of the eve-online forums. lavista vista, i suggest you actually go take the time (omg, effort incoming!) and read the ah topics, not just the ones that interest you. note how many csm repsonses their are. then go to a topic that you or another csm member really cares about and see how many csm repsonses over one line are in that thread. communication? my ass, more like using the csm to further your own agenda. don't bull**** me."
"so who got banned?"
"yes, it was harder to get a full permanent ban back then than it was today and the penalties that accrue leading up to said ban are more severe now."
"name me one csm member who doesn't do that...goons? hmm, no agenda there, i'm sure</sarcasm>as for jade constantine, lolagendasame for all the rest, they are just the most obvious examples.and do you know what, nobody cares. it was expected they would, which is why players voted for the one they wanted."
"you are very much mistaken there goumindong. back in the day it used to be possible to get a permanent forum ban for 10 signature size offenses if you were unlucky enough (or any combination of minor transgressions) the problem was that the forum rules made absolutely no distinction between minor issues and serious ones and simply handed out then perma-ban stick at a count of 10. the new forum regime has several important improvements over the last one: firstly, most minor \"offenses\" don't actually involve warnings - where threads can be cleaned up with deleted bits, locks or moves those don't obligate the moderators to give warnings. example being obvious ooc material on the igs forum - the moderators remove the offending material now - but don't have to give warnings while they do it (though they do give public direction to the people making this mistake. secondly, as far as i know its not possible to actually get a permanent forum ban in the new regime without posting something outrageous on the eve-forums - and this means seriously offensive material. i think we can all agree that somebody posting ****ography or extremely nasty images deserves what they get. there was a reason that scores of perfectly good posters got permanent forum bans back in the day and that was that all offenses were considered \"equal\" and it was a 10 strikes and you're out regime. fortunately thats all changed, we've now got a professional moderation crew - and the moderators are using a lot more discretion in using surgery on bad threads and posts rather than a ubiquitous ban-stick and things are definitely better from the ccp end at least."
"v0v forum moderation is not within the csm's purview so i'm really not sure where you could go to get that rectified, aside from asking that your request be escalated, which may very well still get you nowhere.as far as the amnesty, while it was certainly necessary i wouldn't go so far as to say that it is no longer held against you. it's quite the opposite."
"i suspected as much. oh, of course not re #1, that seems a less offensive thing than dozens of others i've seen elsewhere. more juvenile, but then what do you expect of a goon on caod? re #2, i said nastier things in the same vein to the same person on the same thread. gotta love the vagarities of the report button. i thought the council had jurisdiction over everything eve related. you've brought up the forums, pricing schemes, and all sorts of other things outside the purview of the game itself, why would forum management be any different?"
"where do you get this from?"
"the community manager. i'll email the relevant portion of the email to the mailing list or post it on the csm forum."
"there's a csm forum?"
"that was pretty much my line of thought, and i said as much regarding various other posts in the thread. v0v difference of opinion i suppose.i'm not sure why it's different. only that i've been informed it is. i don't agree with it either, but i don't work for ccp and wasn't a part of that decision tree."
"yes, as of about 2 weeks ago."
"yes. so far, it's just used for discussing issues which are being raised."
"that seems like an odd use - each topic being raised already has a forum thread, by definition. you have the mailing list for private communications and the eve boards for public - what's this third one for?"
"it's a better format than the mailing list for communicating. the mailing list is also provided externally rather than ccp. imo ccp should be providing the tools the csm needs to operate, so while i'm opposed to the private comms at all, it's better comms provided by ccp than some random 3rd party."
"well, we already spend tons of time during meetings asking questions on each issue. it's more productive to do that in a forum *before* the meeting. but it has obviously not been the case that people are interested in that, seemingly because they have to do it in a public forum.so in order to actually have some kind of meaningful discussion, i personally, as well as a few others, posted all the issues that was being raised, right on there.it was not very well adopted though. also, the mailing list is a privately hosted one, by serenity steele. it would not be good if it was to be passed on to the next csm. a tool provided by ccp is much better."

"lag is still experienced daily. i was warping around empire hte other night and experiencing all manner of weird bouts, warping to gates out of synch and such. quite a few people in the destination system were complaining about it. there've also been quite a few fleet battles that i'm aware of which were impacted."
"thumbs up."

"this one is straight forward. when you receive a mark or a warning of any type against your account, either for your posting on the forums or in-game, the notification is either emailed to an external email address or sent via evemail. evemail today is all but useless and i don't believe relying on an external email address beyond the control of ccp and often the end-user is the wisest course of action.i'd like to recommend to ccp that these items be placed somewhere accessible to you from the forums, under \"my account\" for instance, so that you may review these items and players don't encounter a situation where they receive a warning of some type but are unaware of it. i honestly don't see this as something which is anything other than reasonable and it should probably already be there."

"while you may disagree with alliances in fw, you seem to think that your opinion is the only one that counts. here are four threads i was able to find on the topic, and even if you assume that people voted in multiple threads (i did), there are at least 76 unique thumbs up (quite a bit more that 23) represented here:alliances should be allowed to participate in factional warfare - 24 thumbs up[issue] alliances and factional warfare - 26 thumbs up[proposal] inclusion of 'rp' alliances into fw - 23 thumbs up[issue] allowing corps to sign up for fw without leaving alliances - 76 thumbs uphere is a partial list of corps and alliances represented by the thumbs up, including militia affiliation where known:pie inc.

(note that i'm more familiar with the amarr/matar front, so i didn't recognize much in the way of gallente/caldari groups.)bottom line? you're flat wrong. there is considerable interest in this topic ... just not from you. and you are not 99% of fw."
"first of all, this topic will be up next sunday."
"wow! amazing suggestion/feature!!! not to mention it would reduce the calls to db for each activation/deactivation if implemented properly.true.up."
"i can see your logic about stackless io reducing lag, thus making it less of a concern.but i don't think just because we have had such an awesome improvement, that it means we can just throw db calls all over the place. we could re-raise this issue, but you will get the response much sooner if you ask a dev during a q&a session at fanfest."
"people regularly change ammo type anyway. a way to do it in less clicks won't affect what is already done regularly.if you really want to complain about lag, just set a limit e.g. you can only change ammo for every weapon every 1 min or whatever/"
"ok, how about it only working while in station."
"1. how is this different than ctrl-r ?your doing a \"reload all weapons with avaiable ammo\" command there...2. could you not just setup a client side macro disguised as a reload all with ammo x button?this macro would reload all turrets with the new ammo using a sequential, time delayed, command.i.e->send commands to reload turret 1 with ammo x->wait->send commands to reload turret 2 with ammo x->waityou could even make the delay longer that a human's manual reload time, thereby decreasing the command spikes on the server.edit: phrasing"
"how about having it automatically stagared? so when you hit reload all you get an in-game macro that unloads one gun, loads it, unloads the next gun, loads it, etc. hell, if you time it right, you might even reduce lag."
"well, text limits turns out to be in place to prevent exploits.ccp doesn't want to discuss exploits. so really, there's not much we can do"
"maybe ccp should fix those exploits?even just increasing limits would be good, e.g. 2x the limit for bio, mail and notes.also, it needs some kind of indication when it is over the limit (or even preventing you from adding more), notes has one but it only gives a warning when it is a lot over the limit and not a bit, if it is only a bit over the limit then first thing you know is when you open it and see the end has been cut off."
"there are a couple corner cases where unlimited lengths would indeed be exploitable - for example, using your bio as a lag bomb, as mentioned above. it would be woefully indiscriminate, but it would break the game for the poor sap who looks at you. that sort of thing does need to be avoided, which is why i mentioned pagination above. but aside from that i'm really confused by what they could be referring to. if it's possible to put a virus or similar into the game by typing it in plaintext, they really need to work on their security measures. and if they're referring to players putting so much stuff in that it overflows their system, i did say that i was fine with limits that didn't interfere with most user experiences. i know ccp won't discuss exploits(and i concur with that policy, for that matter), and so i don't suspect that we'll ever have an answer to this. but still, i really wish i knew what they were talking about.in any case, note my edited proposal above - it's still worth bringing forward imo, since it gives ccp room to deal with these concerns while still hopefully getting this issue at least partially addressed."
"this is utterly insane.the spirit of the idea is valid.but you failed to take one thing into account.what the hell happens to a player whose broke...but picks up a mission that is not in the local system?oops.. guess you forgot to think about that.that's all we need... beggars asking for a few hundred isk just to do the mission.compound that exponentially and you have an even bigger mess than before.epic fail./thumbs downps: and before you make a response.. also take into account standings could be negative... or systems with very few if any agents... and then some. this nothing more than a big fat annoyance to drive away players."
"well im glad people are paying attention to this thread..and questioning the whole premise of arbitrary isk sink threads(not unlike the npc player corp tax..they are just that arbitrary useless and just a complete hinderance to game play in eve..if you dont support this thread i hope you also will not support the npc corp tax thread."
"it should be free in 0.0 and gradually increasing by 100 isk per .1 sec gain to 1000 isk for high sec.not the other way around.encourage people to migrate from jita, not oposite."
"the npc corp tax was not suggested as a thoughtless isk sink, it was suggested as a fee for invulnerability to wardecs. i think the rationale was a bad one, but at least it had a rationale. jonathan swift you aren't."
"and yet i think you'll agree ccp had a damn good reason for it..so new players could have a safe (relatively)place to develop skills and prepare for the larger eve..this tax will needlessly hinder those players. should they pay for the sins of those who decide to stay and clutter up and abuse the npc corp ...i think not."
"in nullsec, asessing a fine would be a great way to end small gang warfare forever. i don't want to have to spend any isk for a roam. period. if this were implemented in 0.0, it should be for sov 3 or 4 systems, and the isk goes to the alliance wallet. i think this would be a great way to get the game to move into low and nulsec. you should actually decrease the fines the further from 1.0 you go. pilots would then be encouraged to leave 1.0 quickly, and enter more profitable lowsec, and the concept of the 'cheep but risky' industrialist might actually come around. besides it makes sense. the further from government you are, the cheaper taxes and levies get."
"at the risk of supporting something i just flat do not care for...i will say its a major issue regardless.i've heard its common for corps to get war'deced..then the whole lot of im just duck and cover by bailing out of the corp and leaving an alt on the ceo.yet the purpose of the said ability is for people to evade greifing.and no i don't give a #### about what you think about that bit.i will offer this idea.if your going to prevent act's of cowardace and abandonment with tactics such as corp jumping.require a fee to be paid to concord/ded/scc whomever... for leaving a corp during a time of war.the fee should be substantial but not insane.or perhaps have the fee be made payable to the war dec'ing corp. (which personally i don't like but its incentive enough to have an impact on your honor and ethics of bending over and saying \"kick me\" to the corp that's war decing you)this way you pay a fine for invunerability.you can also require an enterance fee for joining a corp as well.perhaps a cool down period of... a week or more?during war'dec.theres many ways you can take this.but unlike a tax... its centered around an area of exploitation.. the ability to hide under a rock.... without penalty."
"hasn't corp-hopping to avoid a wardec already been declared an exploit like a year ago? i thought you could petition it and have them get put back into the corp."
"not if your leaving a corp to join an npc corp.corp jumping makes sense as an exploit...but leaving a corp still is... technically speaking... corp jumping only your going to a \"default\" place holder which makes you immune to war decs."
"i may be wrong, but i thought that was banned too. if it's not then there should be something providing an incentive not to do this, agreed. this is probably best addressed by revamping the war system, but i'll agree that something is necessary."
"afik you don't get banned unless someone really pursue's the matter to the extremes.after all it would mean those who join up and then find out they are getting war'dec'd as part of the \"bonus's of joining a corp\" and then change there minds about the whole thing...would be messy at best.hence my suggestion of using fines/fee'sif they want to avoid war'decs they should penalize people so to speak."
"the exploit you are referring to is leaving a corp to reform it exactly at it was before under another name. leaving a corp to join another in time of war (npc or pc) is in no way an exploit.the op idea is so full of potential exploit that is incredible that someone is actually contemplating it.read the following list:- ceo do a heavy campaing for recruiting;- increase tax and wardec corp with alt corp;- now player in the corp are locked in unless they pay concord (and the ceo need only to keep his tax rate a bit under the cost of leaving the corp to keep them in) or even better they have to pay the ceo alt corporation to leave the corp. then there is the added joke that if you have a spy in your corporation when wardecced you will be incapable of ejecting him as he will not pay the concord fee to leave the corp. i suspect that people with more devious mind that me will find other even more interesting way to exploit an idea like this."
"ah, right, that's what it was. you are a devious man. i like it."
"your kinda ******ed if you belive what you wrote here.a fee while being at war is really stupid, especially for 0.0 alliances that often times always have war decs and multiple at that."
"your supposed to be able to kick players from the corp.if you can't... then there should be that option.otherwise you'll end up with a pile of people who refuse to leave to be an annoyance or worse.as far as the exploits.... that entirely depends on the implementation of that.and i don't see anyone here making suggestions.. just criticizing it."
"you might want to read what you wrote before you say its stupid."
"exactly, i think it is an awful idea and there is no way to make it valid. so i will point the flaw in it tha ti notice. no intention to do constructive criticism, only destructive (and thi is eve, destruction is good)."
"this suggestion is built on the false assumption that players are obligated to be vunlerable to war dec's.if invulnerablity was not supposed to be an option, then game mechanics would allow you to declare war's against players in npc corps.but that is not how the game is intended to work.game balance requires that players have a reasonable means of retreating from combat so that they can rebuild, and prepare to mount a counter attack if the choose to do so.to remove the option of retreat in eve would have the same net effect as permant death: in short order, you reach a point where your only option is to quit or start over. that works great for first person shooters, not so much for mmo's."
"yes... let's continue the destruction of eve.... oh wait.. you didn't mean that did you.^_^ (quip)"
"but you have a conundrum....the greifer's and people who actually war'dec for \"fun\" as opposed to torture... get shortchanged when people bail out in the middle of a war'dec and hide behind an npc corp.i don't think ccp intended for that to be the case aside from players opting out of such things.all i'm trying to do is avoid the \"tax the carebears\" tripe and suggest that a penalty be issued to people who intentionally... jump ship because of a war'dec.it allows them to hide.... as they wish... but only if they pay the fine.it dosen't cut them off.. it doesn't shortchange the war'dec'ing corp as that money could feasibly go to them.... as the greater majority demand ransom.as far as a reasonable means of retreat.... there is no such thing.the idea of building a corp. is to remain alive as such.to pull out in such a fashion is not exactly honorable... and most don't give a rip about such a notion anyway... they end up rebuilding... or making a new corp... or something to that effect.this is not to remove the option of retreat... its just putting a price tag on it to make sure that some sort of compensation is given."
"exactly!i believe that the missile speeds are way too slow, other ships are insta damage like they should. as far as the \"well missiles don't miss or missiles do more damage\", missiles do not miss but that is assuming other ships haven't popped it or it hasn't flown away since you launched them. the damage is not a factor if the targets are moving since takes almost nothing to go faster than the explosion velocity. at long distances turret ships do not suffer the tracking problems like they would close up. they fire and hit, caldari fire a missile and wait.. and wait.. and wait.it is not uncommon for me to have 2-3 salvos of missiles in flight before first missile hits and that is if the missile speed is 8km a sec. most the time the missiles have no target by the time they get there.i know caldari have turret ships but how would other races like to have half of their ships removed because of an issue like this."
"i fly gallente. ever try using a drone ship from 200 km away?"
"only problem is that fc's often want everyone on the primary. we use to target secondary targets but it has gotten to the point where everyone wants insta alpha strike damage. that is what wins a fight right now which means no missile boats unless you are standing on top of the target."
"what is wrong with that? do some math, how long does it take a current missile to get 150kms at 8.5km a second.. 17.6 seconds. so how many targets last 18 seconds unless there is a spider tank going? you could only get 20km/s if you put 2-3 rigs on your missile boat if the speed was doubled."
"missles are getting nurfed with the nano nurf - not buffed. you are asking for the wrong thing at the worst time. missles are an ok wepon system - but in fleet, instant damage is key - any missle lag, no matter how slight, is a disadvantage in fleet - the solution is to train for the rokh or train another races battleship (i would recommend amarr). missle lag is here to stay, missles are not gonna get faster (they are gonna get slower) so you best be planning for that."
"this is a stupid thread. caldari has a very competent line-up of railboats, and missiles are excellent - whether as close-range gank weapons, or as long-range fleet antisupport tools.and if your target warps from the field? well, the entire point of shooting a ship is to remove it from the field. as long as you don't attempt to shoot the fleet snipers' primaries, you'll be fine."
"see... if your caldari which are known for missile ships you need to train for another races ship or use a non missile caldari ship. so like i said half of the caldari fleet is worthless unless your pos shooting or unless a capital ship is tackled.the point of removing a ship from fighting is just that, blowing it up, just because it warps off does not mean its out of the fight.people can flame all they like, what if someone told the other races that turret guns are no longer effective and they need to train caladri missile ships how would you like that?why have the race that is know for its missile ships only to make it so everyone needs to use guns. that defeats the purpose of having that race."
"next time read before you post.. fc's are telling people in fleet for everyone to shoot the primary and many are now saying if your in a missile ship thanks but no thanks.like i said, either give the caldari more turret based ships or fix missiles since 1/2 of the ships now have little to no worth."
"so let me get this straight. you are asking for a change because some fc's in \"your\" alliance is telling you to bring something else. and you are having heart burn about it because you are a special snowflake?"
"if your fcs are telling your specialised missile antisupport ships to shoot the snipers' primaries, rather than the enemy support, then the problem is not missiles, it's your fcs."
"not just my alliance, every fc from every alliance i have been in a fleet with."
"so what. fc's have to work with the current lag prone environment we have to operate in. no amount of doubling, tripling the speed of missiles will make that much of a difference. it still has the effect of not getting there when it should on the primaries. it is what it is. with missiles you have consistent damage, always hit, no tracking issues, fire and forget, no fall off, no adjusting trajectory. hits from 0 to max range. optional damage types, requires flight time to get to target. with guns it hits immediately, tracking issues, variable damage, fall-off, hits are chance based, have to pay attention to trajectory, distance and so on. hybrids have no optional damage types, need to change ammo to increase range or increase damage. amaar has no reloading, variable ammo. minmi has low dps but high alpha. so there is your trade off. e: plus the rohk is one of the best snipers in the game."
"sounds like someone forgot about explosion velocity take away from damage or explosion radius. the effect is even larger against faster ships in a fleet fight. it doesn't take much to negate the damage of a missile.yes the rokh is a decent ship but the cost is sky high."
"missiles have their high points too, like the lack of tracking that allows a raven to shoot down a frigate, no mater how fast they're going (unless they break 6 km.)buying a rohk is a much better solution than making missiles overpowered again."
"your knit picking now. and looking for an easy button.why in the world would any one fire cruise or heavies at a ceptor in a fleet battle? why? you wouldn't. cruise and heavies are reserved for cruiser/battle cruiser targets. i.e. bb's, caracals, canes, falcons etc. when you are in the support, you should have a priority of targets on your overview based on what your ship and weapon systems can handle and the most effective. and as far as the rohk being sky high, well yea but its insurable. and you get most of your cash back. i have seen the rohk in 0.0 any where from 135 to 180. it depends on where you shop. and if you have buddies that can build you one, all it takes is a bit of effort on your part to have one built or build one your self."
"you see much drone boat or blaster boat in fleet operations? here it go half of the gallente fleet for exactly the same reason. and we don't even have a good ewar ship."
"complaining that the raven is not a very good sniper when you have access to the rokh is like complaining that you can't open a bottle with a cigarette lighter when there's a bottle opener sitting right next to you.you seem to be under the impression that \"half your ships\" being sub-optimal for a particular type of combat is a bad thing. how stupid would it be if every ship was good at everything?"
"i am all for such an option, if...and there it starts.if there are realistic market fluctuations to both stock value and dividends.that means that your shares may end up being worthless. literally. stock exchange is not a safe money maker. if it was, everyone would buy shares all the time.eventually, it is not worth the effort to implement. yet."
"the problem here is that it would help most the people who need isk the least, whilst fueling inflation."
"how about the aggression flag being set on for all fleet members in same system?if a pilot joins in that fleet after the aggression, no aggression flag."
"what gave you the impression that only sf cared about the various fw proposals? in most cases, i saw support from numerous people representing many corps or alliances both inside and outside of fw. one of my biggest issues is granting access in some manner to fw to pilots in alliances. i appreciate having members of the csm support this issue, one which is supported heavily by a wide variety of rp alliances on both sides of the war, including corps in fw (17tw, k's, heretics, pie) and alliances not (yet) in fw (cva, vv, u'k, em), to name just a few.given that fw issues affects around 20k participants, and includes the interests of thousands more non-participants, how is it 'abusive' or 'corrupt' to represent the wishes of such a large constituency? also, given that star fraction have positioned themselves as hostile toward all four factions, how do you imagine that any mechanics improving fw would benefit them in any way, except possibly to generate more interest in fw and therefore expand their target base?i'm not sure exactly what your 'issue' is, but whatever it is, consider it/unsigned"

"hello all,eve is a game about economy. since we can't create planned obselescence, there has to be another way for items to be replaced. we can't rely on technology, as merely placing a new type of ship in this game requires a boatload of thought (from concept to art to balance to coding to modifying the live servers).pvp is rough in this game, and i have been on both sides of the gun. i don't like ganking/suicide ganking/gatecamping, but it's a part of the game i enjoy playing and i wouldn't have it any other way.i'm not saying that pvp in this game is ideal or perfect, but any game is going to have some flaws. i'm bidding for a seat in the csm so i can help people with the game i've played for so many years now.this is a true sandbox game, and as with a real-world sandbox, there are always going to be bullies and wimps, the people who make the sand castle and the people who kick it to see somebody cry. pvp flags would destroy this game, as would most other \"let me play in peace\" ideas. as a mmo, you will interact with the community in one fashion or another (whether salvage/can thieves in missions, gatecampers in low-sec, selling items on the market, etc).as the poster above me stated, this is eve. everybody vs everybody. as such, it should not and in fact cannot be changed without rewriting or destroying the eve we all play."
"my six-pence (and im new tot he game) would be that players are given a panic button.this button will alert online members in their corperation that they are under attack.not only will this be a revenue oppotunity for the crop, because they could set a charge for every time they bail you out of trouble... but it will also make pirating that little more risk when picking on that defencless miner and what not..... 2 mins into the fight you get 10 people (wishfull thinking) from their corps show up who are willing to pvp...lets see how good you really are.. :-)but im a hauler... i appreicate the risks... and i accept them... thats life... it aint fair... and bigger dogs will always want to show there top by picking on the lower ones.... but it would be nice to have a distress system==edit==i have since spoken with some folk who say that what the corp channel is for... but it would be far simpler to hit one button that tells folk your location and whats hitting you than it would to type out you need help, where you are and whats attacking you."

"oh, i'm familiar with why it happened, but like you i'm trying not to go too deep into rl economic analysis on an internet spaceship forum."
"i would actually like your input in this. i hear that iceland may register the first national bankruptcy, and i'd like to know other economically-interested peoples' inputs. please feel free to convo me or evemail me at your convenience.also, if you're running, i look forward to a good political campaign. last time, i think we were pretty much neck-and-neck at the finish line, although not in the top running."

"the age limit is being held for csm ii and will be implemented in csm iii."
"to me we're talking about two things here.a) how ideas are put on the csm agenda.b) what do csm members think about the idea.i'd prefer a neutral system for putting up ideas on the agenda, in stead of a csm member having to support it. no definite idea here btw, something like a fixed number of support votes perhaps?after it's put online of course the opinion of the csm members decides if it should be passed to ccp.why?some items 'float' for a long time without any acknowledgment or support from a csm member. i assume this is because no csm member supports that idea. this of course is their right, but if it would come to a vote at least we'd see the argumentation behind the opinion and thus the vote.now all i can do is think 'well, maybe they haven't looked at it yet?'"
"that methodology exists today. if a portion of the playerbase expresses support for an issue by voting on it in the assembly hall the csm has no choice but to address the issue. the problem is that the current percentage is a bit unrealistic.they've significantly lowered the number for the next csm."
"actually, i'm quite surprised at ccp and their willingness to follow the csm's suggestions. i didn't think they'd have the understanding that they currently have, nor the force of change they're willing to give for these changes.from following the assembly hall discussions for the past 3-4 months, i've noticed that a lot of issues that had raised concern are suddenly getting the spotlight they deserved, although i can't say whether this was planned or not. issues such as the linux/mac problems, the industrial expansion (midas), suicide ganking, and others, are getting a spotlight i didn't think would happen for many months.kudos to ccp, and keep up the good work. likewise, kudos to many members of the last csm for getting these issues to the attention of the devs. i only hope i can fill the shoes that may be left open adequately."

"the following is a combined proposal which is more specific and on a smaller scale than what i usually prefer to deal with but i thought it was neat. i'm submitting this on behalf of my brosef vio geraci and have credited the necessary inspirational/contributive minds at the bottom. this is mostly a braindump intended to stimulate discussion, and it would be cleaned up before being finally issued.concepta pirate base structure that is launched at a safespot and is designed to be deployed offensively, and allowing one to refit/store loot. \"covert pos\" maybe. it would not be scannable or probe-able, and would have a shield that prevented things within radius from being probed out --perhaps by cloaking anything within that radius. no defenses per say, but also not findable except via infiltration (meta gaming) or if it goes offline due to fuel issues. perhaps one can probe it out during a half hour period each day, as it refuels.lunacy?this is less dumb than it sounds --there's nothing radically unfair about being able to refit and hide loot/reload. the problem i can think of is people would deploy these in their own territory and then just leave their ships there, rather than at pos as they do --maybe this isn't that bad a problem, or maybe have the cloaking shield only extend 5km and have it eject unpiloted ships/cans in a manner similar to some pos, which are then scannable and potentially compromise the base.limitsmaking a \"cloaking radius\" very small will limit the number of ships that can hide in it, and also make it possible for a ship to drift outside of it by accident, allowing the base to be probed out. the radius would have to be small enough to prevent entire fleets and especially capitals from hiding there. perhaps 500m. perhaps warping to one of these bases would stop you 500m away from the shield, in a manner similar to pos shields, so that there is a small window in which to probe people out, and adding risk whenever they are used.storage capabilitiesmake its storage capacity small, perhaps around the size of a carrier's cargo space. definitely not big enough to store pos parts. this isn't a covert offensive staging facility so much as a base for prolonged griefing operations. perhaps make it impossible to anchor them in sov 4 systems. perhaps limit the kind of things that can be stored in them.destroying itin concept, it would be killable via metagame espionage, lack of fuel, or carelessness, like maybe ships can't idle at it too long. perhaps it needs to be refueled daily, so it is imprudent to maintain too many of these at once. or perhaps it would only need a small amount of fuel but it would have to be manually moved, each day.advantagesadvantages include enabling asymmetrical warfare, offering incentives for corps or operating groups to be smaller and thus less vulnerable to espionage, more fun things to spend money on and build, more places to fight that aren't a pos or station, more fun anchorable structures. it also would allow ships hiding at it to not cripple their setups by fitting a cloak. i believe most of the mechanics for this are already in the game, and so this would not be an undue strain upon ccp man-hours.credit for inspiration/suggestions: jade constantine, darius \"i'm very busy\" johnson, daveydweeb, ~*vio geraci*~"
"that would be devious... but very cool.i would also like to think such a thing could be use not just at a safe spot... but elsewhere.however you need to clearly indicate the definition of a \"safespot\".and what of standard pos spots? could you deploy such a thing there?and would you be able to set up the usual pos equipment as well... observing the limitations of course."
"i believe the concept to be essentially an unprobeable forward base for small gang griefing in enemy territory. as such simply anchoring them to moons as per a normal pos would be unacceptable. i'm thinking more along the lines of it being an anchorable cloaking container with a decently sized field. so your gang can store your **** in it while raiding hostile turf.no pos equipment.:edit: although some form of covert cyno beacon would be p. cool."
"this might be exactly the sort of thing that guerrilla warfare needs. the covert cyno gen off a covert station in enemy territory would be even cooler. supported."
"this is awesome, vio is awesome"
"the only issue i have is the defition of a \"safespot\" would have to be some sort of area defined clearly with boundries to prevent abuse.so perhaps anything in empty space with a surounding radius of nothing for.... 2 to 3au's minimum?call it a shot in the dark... but if you could clearly indicate the limit... that would be great.as far as what kind of equipment... i was only thinking of hidden hangers... and what not. but yeah... i'm good for it.ps: nice to see the professional and rational side of the goons... i may have misjudged you. not all goons are alike it would seem. nice work darius... nice work./signed"
"good idea but needs alot of work, supported.edit: re-read your post and noticed my idea, was actually your idea :d"
"to stop people from deploying from within their own territory, you could make it so it can only be deployed in constellations that are owned by a wartarget of yours. soon as the war ends or soveignty changes, the cloak drops and they're probeable."
"this would be silly, since 0.0 powers rarely formally wardec each other while actually fighting."
"it's the kernel of a pretty good idea. what i'd say, though, is that the covert cyno generator would be overpowered, as well as devaluing the black ops bs. if people want to generate covert cynos, make them insert the right ship."
"naw people would just abuse this with an alt alliance claming sov with a mutual wardec then.sounds like it would add a nice new mechanic to the game thou"
"overall, this is a pretty clever concept. i would not tie deployment to war-decs because i'd hate to see that mechanic have utility beyond empire. that also limits the ability to use these in meta-gaming (e.g., to deploy them in territory of an ally to double cross them).otoh, tying the utility of this to offensive operations is better. instead of war-decs, perhaps they should be cloaked only when deployed in systems of different sovereignty. if sovereignty changes, all newly friendly ninja-poses decloak and appear on scanner to anyone."
"sounds like a good way to add a bit of intrigue and surprise to the current predictability of fights--being able to conceal numbers as well as give hidden bases.i would make these things have a glass jaw, where 5km smartbombs, stealth bomber bombs, and even doomsdays would reveal or quickly destroy these structures. it would make those using these have to be extra cautious, in that you don't always *need* a covops to foil these bases--it just helps *a lot*."
"i think you should be able to get 10 people at this, just like the number of people able to refit at a carrier."
"have kicked around the idea several times myself. by any measure would make the game more interesting. kind of disappointing that the only means of offline presence so far is outposts. it's like a right of existence...inalienable rights. yeah. that's the stuff."
"this is a good idea, but it still hurts my favorite form of pvp, defense gangs."
"i would love this kind of stuff from my own personal play style.but i have a concern about a thing which is designed so that there must be meta-gaming in order to destroy/counter it.so i'm really not sure what to think of this.isn't it going to make the \"griefing\" that happens with people who sit cloaked in a system for hours, scaring ratters away? i personally think it's a valid play-style. but people are going to whine about it, and this will decrease the barrier to entry for doing it."
"i would like to see the fuel capacity max 14 days for example, but seperate cloaking fuel max capacity 24 hours.no stront so if its allowed to go uncloaked, its destroyable immediately.and make it faction only, with fitting variatins depending onfaction.. maybe even unique abilities per faction, and reasonably expensive."
"i was part of the early discussion on this. after weighing the pros and cons, i'm personally against the idea of the base generating a cloaking field for nearby ships, unless there's some mechanism to prevent permanent afk-cloaking. if you want to do that, simply fit a cloak on your ship. also, i like the idea of being able to probe out the base via ships while it's being used and refueled. one thing not specifically mentioned above is the base has obvious pve uses as well - to rat and explore in hostile space. in terms of storage capacity, i think a proper size would be roughly that of a gsc (3900 m3)."
"the idea that was tossed around, and wasn't perhaps clear enough in the proposal is that the anchorable would be vulnerable periodically, perhaps during a refueling cycle that must happen daily, or when a ship dips outside the shields. then the structure can be probed. the intent was for meta-gaming to be a way to find it but certainly not the only way.people will whine about virtually any proposal. a lot of people seem to want to play a game in which they're completely invincible. that game isn't eve and when you're playing a cut throat game, someone is always going to be unhappy. that is inherent in the design.to further add to the statement regarding people sitting cloaked in a system for hours... so what? it's a perfectly valid play mechanic and i'm really not all that concerned about people complaining about the way people choose to play a game within the rules. some people flat out don't like cloaks. others don't like speed. it's the nature of the beast."
"one reason i'm being careful with fuel is that the target audience for this is smaller gangs and smaller ships. it needs to be designed in such a way that the fuel capacity is not such that some crazy ship is needed to keep it running. perhaps an additional use for the deep space transports."
"mechanic suggestion:fielded at lagrange points and can be de-cloaked. you can put it anywhere on the grid, with one caveat. if you put it smack in the middle, it will be anchored solidly. if you put it 200km away, within a few hours it will \"spiral out of stable orbit and destruct into the sun\" aka despawn with all your stuff and your clone in it.you can re-deploy it back towards the center of the grid periodically should you chose or just let it float off if you need. you can put it dead center in some backwater system if you need an emergency log-off spot or a safe stash.this way, there is a reliable, albeit tedious, way to sweep your entire system of enemy structures. or at least get the ones that aren't being managed actively.at the same time pilots can adapt the placement to meet their needs. they can make it not worth tracking down but higher maintenance or they can make it semi-permanent but easy to track down if somebody's looking.make the lagrang points show up in solar system browser and let that be the end of it.as far as size, it'd be nice to see a few versions for different needs. there should definitely be one that fits inside a blockade runner with room for loot to spare that can house several ships. sounds like we're talking about basically a cloaked tent of sorts. much more compact than the ships and goods it stores.just tacking on some more ideas, but say the black ops get ability to sling deep space transports around, have one sized appropriately for a gang doing that sort of thing."
"i really liked this idea when i read it in jade's blog, yes i read the whole thing a suggestion would be perhaps you would have to switch off the cloak temporarily in order to enter or leave it and risk it getting found out so entering it, thus making it difficult to find but not impossible. not that i'm totally against metagaming but i don't think it should be the sole tactic for a ruse. plus forcing people to overcome an obstacle by having to metagame will create a lot of detractors to what is an excellent idea."
"hell yes. deep space transporters are much needed."
"if the concern is how you would get access to it, think of how a normal secret base works. if you never use it, it's virtually impossible to find, but if you've got a small city moving in and out every day, it's obvious. they're found by traffic analysis, not by searching every square inch of the planet. make it so that use of the base is what allows it to be found - say, it takes a few minutes for the cloak to cover each new ship. if you only go there once a day, it's safe, but if you base a fleet out of it then any fool with a scan probe will find it easily.jade has a blog? link please."
"now this is the kind of ideas we need to help bring some fun back into the game again. just keep it simple. fewer moving parts means less **** can go wrong with it."
"yeh that part seemed like an afterthought when i read it, something that makes it probeable would be cool but i wouldn't leave it wholly out of player control when the cloak goes offline."
"his blog for the csm campaign jaysus"
"i like the idea"
"that's largely because vio wanted the thing that way and i pretty much flat out copied and pasted what he said. i'll edit as ideas bubble up in thsi thread to reflect things better."
"i agree, and therefore it doesnt need to stick to the std fuel types/costs we see in sov claiming towers, no reason why a full 2 weeks fuel shouldnt fit into a 5 black ops bs cargo holds, and the cloaking fuel be something again small but expenxive.maybe a new set of fuels could be created, made from the pos reactions that industrialists do, thus making new in in game content for those guys also.i like this idea, but i do not like the ability for people to sit within it cloaked (this is part of my belief that cloaks should cost fuel to run, and therefore be limited in cloaking time overall). stored ships cloaked good, small gangs cloaked wthout having to fit cloaks, not so good.although could be funny if one is scanned down just outside cloak range, and a defensive fleet of hics are on the scene to lock everyone sat inside down."
"there's also the possibility of the structure simply running out of gas and needing to be replaced, but i'm still up in the air as far as fuel/onlining issues. i am leaning towards herschel's idea though regarding the probability being directly proportionate to the number of ships inside."
"this sounds awesome, something that any small-gang/corp could use to their advantage."
"i'm opposed to fueling any structures in general. the idea is to make it require some upkeep and player interaction. fueling makes it require harvesting ice etc and there are already too many things that make this game feel like work. give it a timer. no need to have some fueling system to hide the fact that it's a timer. if you really need to hide it, that's why i came up with the lagrange point idea. =)"
"oh, what ushra'khan could do with these... i like the idea, but to be honest, i think there's balance issues. depending on the 'drawbacks' you build into the design, it becomes an invulnerable base, or a worthless hunk of debris. i can't see much in the way of middle ground, unfortunately.definitely something worth thinking about, though."
"maybe instead of fuel, cause continual damage to the structure, based on the mass of ships within its cloak radius. (more ship mass = more strain on the cloaking field.) prevent it from being repaired while anchored. give it a 10-20 minute anchoring and unanchoring delay as well. finally, only allow non-capital ships to refit at it.the mass-based degradation will reduce its viability for concealing a large gang for a long period of time, but still allow it to be used for that purpose in a desperate situation. the degradation rate would be tricky to get right, but i think the mass-based method simplifies the process.the degradation-while-used system prevents the need for tedious fueling, while simultaneously providing a limit to use, and an incentive to spend some time out of the bubble. it also allows use of the station as a long-term rally point, as it will only degrade while being actively used.the anchoring/unanchoring delay and the inability to repair it while anchored creates a window of opportunity for attack, the window increasing in frequency the more the structure is used (due to the degradation).the \"no capitals\" restriction will stop capitals from using it as an emergency cloak-fitting stop. (also, the huge mass of capital ships would cause the structure to melt like the wicked witch.)i think this is a good compromise between all the points of contention brought up, but i may have missed some. thoughts?"
"oh god, please no more fueling and anchoring bull****. it is designed for a small group so let's make it easy to use shall we?i would change it:-pirate base is only anchorable by black ops-lasts for 14 days, then explodes. no fuel.-black ops able to cyno/portal to each pirate base like a covert cyno generatori like the 500m cloaking radius so that blobs cannot use it effectively.thumbs up from me."
"yep!"
"this is a good idea."
"fueling and transportation are an important part of the game, man. they aren't going to just phase it out, and this is something that would obviously require fuel. that said, your idea about a finite duration would probably work, as well.it would be kind of neat to be able to generate a black-ops cyno network inside of your enemies' territory. i'm not sure it would be unbalanced, either. the local inhabitants can already move any ship around, willy-nilly, so why shouldn't hostiles be able to move their stealth bombers and what have you around, with a similar degree of effectiveness."
"i like this. you deploy it, and after 14 days it disintegrates."
"i like the idea, especially if a new reaction is needed to fuel the station. if you pop a hauler full of the stuff, you'll know to wait while they send for another. it'd make the station easier to probe out, especially if the shield drops while refueling.since it's basically a gsc with a small cloaking field designed to be deployed in hostile space, i think it should be able to run for two or three days without needing an outside source of fuel.as far as cloaking nearby ships goes, i think the field should be able to hold, at most, a hauler-sized ship or a few frigates, which should be able to afk.that lagrange point idea someone posted is awful.i like the idea of a two-week disposable covert pos, though."
"this is a p. good idea, and would make 0.0 warfare a bit more fun/exciting. i'm assuming it'd be possible to anchor these in mission running lowsec systems as well? i do think a maximum on how many of these can be in a system is a good idea. either a hard-cap of say, 5, or something a bit more complex like the inability to anchor the structure if it's in a certain range of another object. for example: another pirate base, either your's or someone else's may \"interfere\" with it's ability to online. perhaps it can't be anchored too close to a planet/moon/gate either. alternatively, it has to be anchored within a certain range of a planet, with only one per planet allowed. granted, this would make them a bit easier to probe out.don't mind me, i'm just thinking as i type here."
"my concern in this case is that friendly alliances would occupy all of the available space to prevent hostiles from taking advantage of these."
"was thinking about the aspect of probing the thing out. what if you could probe this thing out in the same way you do with exploration sites, but make it alot less precise and require multiple probes across the whole system. gradually triangulating the spot down until you got within a maximum of say 150km, this would take time and a whole lot of effort too do. maybe increasing the time needed to run scan probes significantly. you'd then end up with a hit that you could observe the surrounding space from.would be like fishing, you sit there in your cov-ops, somewhere within 150km you know there is one of these things. you wait for those few seconds when a ship appears from or goes into the hidden base as it comes in or out of warp. if you blink you might miss it but if you don't, you've found the bastards now..."
"anything that allowed them to be probed out, no matter how arduous, without the users of the pirate bases screwing up in some way, would make these useless for asymmetrical warfare. that is, smaller groups waging war against larger groups."
"this idea is in the same vein as small anchorables, which has already been escalated and replies given from ccp.i can't support something entering enemy territory that is essentially unfindable (if it's unprobable, its unfindable). a place for ships to hide etc; it's ripe grounds for unbalancing warfare massively in favour of the agressors. i can see uses that would go beyond small corps/gangs, .eg, anchor a few in one system (or in neighbouring systems), hide x ships at each (safe building up of a large force that can't be found), then attack with a large fleet that was undetectable.if its gonna enter the game, it should have realistic mechanics that are congruent with other features. being unprobable isn't.take care,arithron"
"so true"
"ok, say you incorporated my idea into the probing ideals of the op, you can only do this at certain times, maybe during the 30minutes of refueling, maybe you could make it more susceptible to probing the more ships are hiding in it. the more strain the cloak is under, the closer hit your probes would get, say the closest would be 100km, furthest could be 5000km. this means that if you have a pirate base that people are using constantly the more risk you have of being triangulatedi think the best part of this comes down to the fact you have to finally pinpoint this thing by eye, you gotta judge exactly where you saw something come out of it and then fly towards that spot. you misjudge it, you could fly right past it by. you bring people in to sweep the area? the guys inside get to sit there and wait, watching people buzz about looking for them, getting ready to defend or ambush the hunters"
"this is a great idea. as long as there are mechanics that make it useful for small gangs, without making it useful for large fleets, i support this."
"player interaction, wether its f1-f8 or fuelling poses, wether its mundane or exciting, is the backbone of eve.eve isnt free, it takes effort, co ordination, time to achive anyhting. timers defeat that fundemantal ideal imho."
"wow something new creative and cool with a dash of wtf sneakiness...i like it."
"sounds good, but needs much more storage space. i can fill a carrier's cargo worth of loot in no time. the cargo size works if you're using it as a forward pvp base, but as a ninja-ratting hq it needs much more. otherwise, it sounds good."
"mundane shouldn't be the backbone of anything i'm paying for as a service. pos fueling is...the most player interaction i've ever had with logistics is helping corp mine ice.there's enough coordination to be had with just getting all the goods together for pvp ops out in deep space. ships are a disposable. we don't really need more disposables, especially ones that don't contribute to why we play the game.you mine ice. throw it in a rabbit hole. it's gone. that is the reality of fuel. countless pod-pilot-hours of eve are spent moving gas from production sources to sinks with no higher purpose. sure, there's a market, but everything that can be produced has a market.moar ships. moar pew pew. no more gas."
"from a mechanics standpoint, even if it was reasonable to allow jump freighters to jump into high sec, the implementation would be problematic. as fuze indirectly pointed out, the main reason jump freighters are unable to do so is that cyno fields themselves are banned in high sec (not jf's which can enter, but only via gates). basically, high-sec has cyno-jammers in every system. from a flavor-text standpoint, it makes a lot more sense for the empires to simply cyno-jam every system to prevent foreign capitals to jump in than to find a way to prevent only capital ships from jumping to a cyno field in their space.as an aside, the events leading up to fw show that it is *possible* to bypass the empire cyno-jammers, but that technology is not available to pod-pilots."
"tired of the russian's popping you at your favorite low-sec cyno point eh."
"i can't believe i just read the entire thread and the only good point made in this failure of a thread was by treelox \"no\".you should never fly anything you can't afford to lose, whether it be a shuttle or a titan, i care not. failthread fails."
"why not. undock - warp to zero on gate - jump = no riskundock-- cyno into highsec = no riskits not making one jot of difference in the risk to the pilot but will save a lot of tedious jumping/aping through high sec.skunk"
"skunk is correct on that risk now is allready very low. however since we are apparently removing boring stuff, why not also give normal freighters ability to jump between high sec systems, otherwise it is boring. and how about you just start a lvl 4 mission and you get 20m isk without the need to do anything."
"saves them time sifting the wheat from the chaff"
"well i'm glad this is a contentious topic :) always more interesting debate.darius' point about the csm not having influence over the forum mods is correct afaik, but that doesn't stop the csm being given the ability to take action on forum bannings.the interesting risk (again by darius) is that a majority council could effectively \"war-report\" a fellow-csm member they wanted kicked out (think thread-nought with reports); at the risk being forum banned themselves for repeatedly reporting posts that didn't deserve it. however that would be a neutral action, as the \"war-reporting\" majority wouldn't vote one of their own out of the council. on the otherhand, the \"war-reporting\" csm would also be unable to communicate (or) do further reports. the only way i can think to counter that is to simply remove a banned persons right to vote, and let alternates step up. as alternates are sequential, this can also be gamed. ideas?"
"so it looks like the problem is that the csm members don't want to discuss issues in advance, not the means for doing so. unfortunate, but woefully common in groups like this - people think i'm slightly mad when i mail reports out in advance of the meeting so people will have time to read them at their leisure, when that's just simple good practice. meetings of more than five people cannot easily contain a useful discussion, so you do the thinking and discussing in advance, and use the meetings for voting, plus some q+a and hashing out issues you want to discuss in real time(of which there are a few). but the idea of a simple issue known and posted on forums a week in advance being discussed for the first time at the meeting itself is utter insanity. i am wholly unsurprised by how long your meetings take. use yahoo groups next time, or something similar. lets you keep a mailing list up long-term, so future councils can use it, without it being one individual's domain."
"it does stop the csm from being able to act on forum bannings as you have no way of knowing it's occurred and ccp will not communicate them to you. since the csm is not in a position to question this policy, nor any other forum policy, then effectively this topic is moot. if i'm a jerk who doesn't want to be removed from the council i simply won't tell you and because of the above items you'll never know.interestingly enough, being banned also prevents you from being able to apply for the council in the first place.personally i don't believe the csm should be in a position of further empowering low-level divisions within ccp with undue influence over the selection process. i believe that to be specifically against the nature of the council in the first place. any division of ccp having influence over the makeup of the council, without itself being subject to any oversight can lead to the same type of situations which the council was formed to prevent.ultimately while i like the idea of standards. i believe they're already being applied and leaving the decision in the hands of a moderation team who has already placed themselves outside of the process is a pretty daft thing to do."
"darius was a moron and went and got himself temp banned and this is jade constantine's pathetic attempt at what he no doubt imagines to be cunning subterfuge.voting no. i don't want csm members to be removed at the caprice of the forum mods."
"yeah, great idea! don't deal with the reason of the ban itself, just trust forum moderators to decide who is and isn't fit to serve as a csm!not only do i not support this, i'll go as far as to say that anyone who does support this should be ashamed of themselves."
"why are we even discussing this? what problem does removing a csm over some temp ban handed out by the forum moderation/gm staff solve? why would someone being temp banned on the forums mean that they have any less community support than they had when they were elected? and even if they did, why would that matter? they were rightfully elected in the first place, right?"
"for the record:darius was banned in a thread for slap fighting with jade constantine, unlike jade his arguments didn't devolve to personal attacks. jade wasn't banned for some stupid reason, and as you can see darius posting it was a temp ban.i don't think forum mods should have any power, be it moderation over csm members. i also don't think if you have had a temp ban prior you are unable to run for csm. right now you can get banned for anything. during the t20 scandal many people were banned after the threadnaught. you can bet if a gm or dev did the same misconduct there would be another threadnaught, or perhaps forums mod, and that would be justified. the forum rules aren't always correct, and people in power aren't always nonpartisan.-hellachicken"
"this is adding more fluff where we don't need it. the unnecessary complications aren't worthwhile.that, and it puts power over csm delegates from people who shouldn't really be involved in the process."
"this would be done with alts.drop it. you are already prohibited from running when you have a forum ban in effect, such there is no reason to allow candidates and representatives to be open to such attacks."
"/signed"
"thumbs down.the csm and the forum mods are two separate entities by design."
"no thanks."
"no support. this is an unecessary extension of power to forum mods in an arena they don't belong in. it only has value if you're looking for a new way to game the system."
"ccp moderation team should have no power of who is isn't on the csm this would set a horrible president espcially with the level of meta gaming in todays eve."
"i look forward to abusing the **** out of this."
"so far, this just seems to be another example of just how useless the whole csm turned out to be. thanks for this."
"this is stupid. you'd be taking my vote away by putting the decision of who is in the csm in the hands of the moderation team and people i did not necessarily vote for."
"ahahahahahahahahahahahahaa permanent in-game ban (on all of your accounts) should be grounds for csm dismissal, nothing less."
"there are a couple things ppl seem to forget:the csm was founded following some rather stupid actions on ccp's part.sooooo, if csm can be banned at the discretion of the moderation team, then the whole thing is just a silly stunt.seeing how the csm is elected by the players, the removal should also be in the hands of the players. ok... say he broke the rules. in this special case, (being a csm member) things could go through a different process than for a regular joe imho they should allow some sort of player controll before removal.a vote by the other csm membersa players votesome sort of mechanism to put the power back in the hands of the players and not in ccp's untrustworthy team again.i vote no"
"how about no."
"wow look at that poorly veiled attempted to get bane and dj kicked from the csm and stop any member of goonswarm every standing again so that certain parties can have their faux influence over ccp and suggest yet more meaningly crap in the name of a free trip to iceland.on top of that would then put the make up of the csm in the hands of ccp forum moderators and gm which of course have no vendettas against inderviduals or corps/alliances since they are totally impartial.why not just come out and say it? you don't want abrasive people who think differently to you in your little circle jerk as it means you might have to oh god... debate things rather than just act as a rubber stamp for solutions to problems that don't exist.the csm is about as ligitmate and has as much control over eve as the east german government did and their icelandic masters are just pulling the strings behind the illusion of allowing the players to have a say on what gets broken next.with this in mind i am going to say... no."
"this is a horribly veiled attempt by jade constantine to get darius kicked off the csm. nothing more, nothing less. if the moderators had one ounce of intelligence, they'd lock this thread."
"forum moderation is inconsistent. this would be too. dnw"
"this is an excellent idea**no it isn't"
"no, forum bans, and in-game bans are two separate things."
"unfortunately, eve-o moderators suck. hard. this just can't work.in-game bans, now that's a different thing."
"this would be a pretty effective tool for ccp themselves to remove people they are finding a pain in the arse from the csm system. a csm member would then have to be afraid of voicing any opinion of the player base because the mods could find one silly rule, forum ban you and then you lose csm. (yes this is serious tinfoil but it is something you would need to take into account)letting the csm council vote anyone they feel like off after a forum ban is also stupid. games of goading eachother into saying stupid things on the forum (like earlier in this term) just to have a power bloc vote them off could become an issue. players voted them there for a reason and they should stay there.a definate no to this stupid idea. you clearly didn't think this through. jesus."
"so if two people are banned for the same offence (which implies the sort of constancy in the current moderation team that we know isn't there) then both will come up for a vote in the csm team. that vote will then be decided by whether the majority of the csm sees it as advantageous to ban someone they disagree with.please don't pretend that the current csm would not use it as a chance to opress the minority: that is the whole point of this motion in the first place.the members are democratically elected by the player base. it is not for a democratic body to alter its own makeup so as to affect the results of an election. after all, it's only been a couple of thousand years and change in which it has been said that delegatus non potest delegatur: the delegates may not, themselves, delegate."
"jade, stop trying to use your little cat's paw serenity to help you alter the makeup of the csm.like the bulk of those posting, i disagree with this transparent attempt at election-stealing. fortunately, there's not a slug's chance in a furnace of ccp being stupid enough to fall for this ridiculously childish play: they know it would stand a chance of further devaluing an institution that they must be desperate to see rid of its drama-queen hijacker of a chairthing."
"no. this kind of policy would only make things worse, as it would open up another place for the csms to slapfight. whether it's people targeting goons, goons targeting others, or random other parties on each other, the players would not be well served."
"i think its probably fair enough that a temp banned csm delegate gets temp-replaced with an alternate according to the previously established tally of voting. so if x delegate got a 1 week ban he or she would be replaced as a voting member by the next alternate for the duration of the ban. if it was a permaban then they'd obviously need to be permanently replaced. now the problem is that the moderators might not like to share the status of the ban upon another player (for privacy reasons and such) - so the csm would need some way of ensuring it was correctly kept up to date on the ban status of its members. perhaps it could be added to the csm signup docs that the delegates agree to do their best to avoid forum disciplinary action and give their permission for the csm officers to be informed about potential forum bans and suchlike.to the few dozen identical posters in the thread above i'd say don't personalize this - its going to be something that does come up in future csms and the delegates need a way to resolve the situation."
"i have real concerns about the demonstrated inconsistency of the moderation team and the potential for abuse as outlined by darius and serenity.voting no.edit: rather, i'd vote no had i the option. what sort of poll is this?!"
"if these kinds of well thought out topics is what the csm spent their time on i ask for csm to be dissolved and new sol nodes be bought with the money saved from it."
"csm people trying to metagame other csms into being banned should be removed from the csm.i mean, come on, this is probably the most transparent csm powerplay to date. serenity, well done on completely hosing what was left of your public image, we now know whose music you're dancing to."
"prince of lies"
"cut it out already. the csm was not put into place to be some venue for you to larp an intergalactic douche-bag.do you remember one of the original reasons for csms? it was put into place as a response to outcry against one of ccp's employees being caught cheating, the initial response to which was mass bannings from the former moderation team. under that light, don't you think this \"law\" might create somewhat of a conflict of interest?"
"resolve what problem?"
"this is dumb, ban op, close thread"
"no, because that would mean that ccp is choosing the reps, instead of the players."
"no, the forum and the game are independent if each other. i'd go so far as to say that a banned csm member is not banned from the csm forums as one is more important than the others. netiquette is independent from knowledge of this game, don't try and make one about the other."
"this idea allows a body that has no ties to the csm or input from the player base to effectively nominate csm members for removal.i see no logic behind allowing this course of action and thus cannot give it any support whatsoever. i strongly encourage my fellow players to do the same."
"furthermore,jade constantine"
"the assembly hall is not an excuse for flaming and personal attacks and i'd like to ask the goonswarm posters in this thread to stop it immediately. it should be possible to debate and even disagree without the need to be openly abusive towards other eve players."
"i don't like or trust ccp's forum moderation policies, especially the way we aren't allowed to discuss them. i loathe this idea."
"weak-kneed pubbies should not be able to remove our ceo from the council."
"we're roleplaying being goons here so stop raining on everyones parade."
"the assembly hall is not an excuse to ignore debate.i ask again, what problem?"
"what a ridiculous suggestion.i mean seriously ridiculous.how does your ability to refrain from breaking forum rules directly effect your ability to shape the game into something that is better than it currently is.knowing you jade, i would bet everything i own that this is some sort of personally motivated bullsht, to get something you want, than about any real concern.which csm members are currently banned? which of them is the person you dont like?bewildering."
"the csm should be more like 0.0 itself: if you can't stand the pressure, go back to jita, or in this case caod."
"point is you don't know me eddz. you don't know anybody who hasn't taken the time or inclination to get to know you in return. this is a computer game with thousands of players - there is a limit to your understanding of other participants and assuming you know everything there is to know about another player always leads to misunderstanding and bad feelings. and this is why its always a bad idea to personalize these assembly hall issues. as far as i know (or have been informed as csm chair) - currently no csm delegates are forum banned."
"if i didn't want my csm delegates to act like goons, i wouldn't have voted for goons in the first place. this proposal effectively disenfranchises people like us.there is a kernel of truth to the original idea - there are some in-game behaviors, such as blatantly using exploits, that ought to disqualify someone for csm membership. these forums, however, are far too meaningless to justify any such action."
"this is a dumb idea.edit: of crap, i hope i don't get temp-banned for this pointless post or else i will never be able to run for csm! by the might of jade, spare me oh omnipotent moderators!"
"we should kick all people of the csm, it's a complete waste of time."
"as far as i know, the csm chair's job is to schedule meetings. i have no idea why you'd be informed in any way ever of anything other than \"here's a topic i'd like to propose\" or \"hey i won't make it to the meeting this week\".:edit: asking goons not to post is pretty silly. they have just as much of a right to voice their opinion as anyone else, including you."
"ccp forum enforcement should not override popular vote, especially with the rolling alternate system of replacement.this proposal puts even the csm member with the greatest electoral mandate (i.e., the most player votes) at the risk of any forum enforcement -- no matter what forum and with no reliably objective standard of conduct.the \"next in line\" alternate system aggravates the problem. consider this example, joe repro is elected to csm with a huge plurality of player votes. he/she gets into a random flame war on the science and industry forum and is temp banned. now in addition to the forum ban penalty (which may only be for cooling off), joe loses his csm seat. more importantly, that huge segment of voting players loses its representation in favor of some other guy for whom far fewer players voted. the potential for disenfranchisement is enormous.forum misconduct requires suitable penalties. those penalties should be gauged according to the conduct penalized, not according to the status of the player at issue. in real elected governments, commission of a crime does not strip a person of elected office. he or she might certainly resign in shame (e.g., nixon), or it might be cause for potential removal through a separate process (e.g., clinton impeachment), or it may cause them to lose re-election (e.g., possibly ted stevens). in the case of a separate process like impeachment or censure, however, that process includes a filter that prevents it from being triggered by every possible infraction and is limited to \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" an elected ruler should not face removal every time they get a speeding ticket. thus, having a forum ban auto-trigger a csm removal vote still makes the csm office too precarious.to emphasize the problem of enhancing penalties because of status, consider the reverse model. should csm members be immune from forum bans because of their status? they need forum access to do their jobs right? the justifications for this rule could just as easily be flipped to immunize csm from the rules of forum protocol. that would be wrong. just as csm members should not be \"above the law\" with regard to forum posting, they should not be specially penalized under those rules either.game bans are another story. if you are not part of the body governed, you should not be in the governing body. if you are stripped of eve citizenship, then your csm status should plainly follow."
"that has to be one of the funniest justifications i've seen in a while. the thing is, though, i'm not sure it's invalid."
"that is already in the agreement i believe."
"i didn't ask them not to post, i asked them not to post abuse and personal attacks."
"the csm is not a venue for you to exercise your own personal agenda against those players who cause you, of your own volition, to step down from your high horse. i'd like to ask the csm members in this thread to kindly shut up and start discussing issues that matter to the people who voted you into the council. it should be possible to vote 9 people into a committee without every other proposal coming off like a slap fight between a couple babies who all want the tickle-me-elmo to themselves."
"if they pretty up their attacks and veil them in [issue] tags will it be considered more appropriate?"
"the don't come up with banana republic style plans of political take overs."
"i honestly don't care what they do as long as they stop using assembly hall as a venue for personal attacks and flaming. discuss the pros and cons of the issue in the thread - or post other issue threads, but its never appropriate to use this ah for flaming and personal attacks against eve players."
"i honestly don't care if you want to change the subject. answer the freaking question.what is this supposed problem or situation you are trying to solve?"
"perhaps they view this issue thread as a fairly transparent attack on individuals within the csm and are voicing their opinions as such. i'd say that forum moderation is left to the moderators, and none of us really has any input into that. there's a lot of posts on these forums i don't like. i ignore them. no big deal."
"nor is it appropriate to introduce or support issues designed as a thinly veiled attack against another player, especially when you are personally just as culpable for being banned in the past."
"jade is trying to pull an acorn in the csm."
"what? hahahahaha.forum bans - no point even talking about it. it's not up to forum moderators to ultimatelly decide who csms will be. end of the story.if csm got an ingame permaban for serious violation(s), i don't think ccp is gonna ask anyone what to do. pretty sure they'd take care of it by themselves.pointless thread."
"i have to agree with sentinel exx because that is a very reasonable argument that makes sense."
"well, simply put, i dont believe this is not personally motivated.you can say i don't \"know\" you, but in the past 5 years i have read probabbly 100s of 1000s of words written by you, i feel i have a fairly good idea of your motivation within eve. its has always been about you for you, maybe an accusation you can sling back at me, but truthfull none the less.this topic is about getting some people you don't like removed from the csm, and indeed i would feel getting the ability going forward to influence the csms makeup.bait subject a with alts, watch his posts like a hawk, report anything that might get him a warning..you are fickle, and see through, you always have been. most people reading this thread deserve to know the feelings of others towards you, people that have experienced your poison pen once before. people \"voting\" on this issue deserve to know as much as possible about the person raising it for discussion, and allow formation of political discussion on the motivations behind it.you dont get to hide in csm, your personality, your motivations, your drivers are on public display, and thats exactly the way it should be.this entire suggestion is ridiculous, i have received forum warnings, i could be very close to another one, what if i got temp banned? that would in some way restrict my ability, and knowledge of the game to attempt in helping influence the way the game goes forward...its a ridiculous concept, and nothing more than an attempt by you to add to your tools.no doubt this post will be reported.but this is a delagation of peers charged with making the game a better place for all of us, your personality is in question as much as your suggested policies, much like your questioning of others personality within this thread it is both reasonable and expected."
"i think we've found the heart of the issue. if this can't get answered convincingly, then there's really no point in discussing anything further."
"adding a method for removal of elected officials, by people who may or may not have alternative motives is by definition itself dumb. granted i only became aware of the csm recently, but from my research it is an elected body of players who are tasked at bringing in-game issues to the attention of ccp. the elected are elected by the player base, based on who they want representing them. the additional mechanism for removal shows a serious lack of foresight and thought to the point of just plain dumb. i won't even discuss the potential for this \"post\", or \"issue\" to be a personal attack on someone at one time banned or not. i won't discuss this not because i have a strong feeling one way or the other, i won't discuss this because previous statements speak for themselves. you can hide your motives only for so long before transparency takes effect. once this is done, you and your idea will be hung for the idiocy presented here and not for the issue. you know as well as any this is a bad idea, funny though it may be, take a look around and count how many support and how many do not support this idea, and where they come from. ultimately however we ask in the spirit of level headed debate that you answer the questions provided. for what reason do you want to see this \"idea\" implemented? what \"issue\" will this remedy? what are the ramifications of this \"issue\"? oh and ... why are you against the debate of an \"idea\" by attempting to silence those who appose you? prior to this post the only thing i can come up with that is close to a personal attack seems to me ... 1. disagreement with your idea 2. not directed at you3. a figment of your imagination the quoted above was a prime example of why this \"idea\" is laughable at best. furthermore, without attempting to make the quoted statement a point of contention, if forums rules (re: personal attacks, etc) were violated there is a proper process with which to handle this. calling it out in a thread is flame bait, but you already knew this. have a nice day just the same :durh:"
"no, this is just stupid. getting someone kicked off the csm because another player thinks they are being flamed is wrong.why don't you go stealth bomb something about it."
"if this goes through, i pretty much plan to do this to jade whenever i get a free moment. alt accounts are relatively cheap, and get you 3 characters with which to troll him.in addition, i'd like to modify this so that people who are temp banned can't vote on the vote to exclude. with sufficient people timing their trolling, i should be able to get anyone i don't like evicted from the council.i'd like to throw my weight behind this issue - there's not a chance that it could be misused by the csm delegates at all."
"the fact that this thread is still open tells me what a good idea the op isn't."
"where is the \"vote no\" option, or rather, why hasn't anyone bothered to included one."
"so you would support an immediate ban of jade from the csm then?"
"any idea how many unfair bannings there have been? ccp shoots first and asks questions later, i myself have been banned on an assumption alone and coincidentally ccp didn't get back to me until the ban time had already expired. dumb thread."
"voting no on this one.forum bans are a joke since they are completely arbitrary. even for in-game actions, eve is well known for banning first and asking questions later. ccp then take weeks to do the investigation which some other mmos do before banning someone. csm membership shouldn't be voted on by the other csms in any circumstance. if someone does something so horrible they should be removed from the council, i have confidence ccp will act to do so."
"yeah maybe if the mods weren't idiots and bans weren't completely arbitrary"
"and thus the jade constantine legacy is further stamped with its signature trait of using the chair to try to push unpopular pet projects and eliminate members of the council that do not agree."
"has anybody yet noticed that this thread was started by serenity steele, not jade constantine? i mean, i know they tend to be allies on the council, but they are two different people."
"anyone who read the op did. i'm guessing they believe the two are in cahoots as they are buddies. much like if bane brought forward something i would be painted under its brush stroke."
"you think jade isn't pushing this issue? who has the most posts in this thread?"
"this is a ridiculous proposal, going completely against the democratic principles of the csm.as elected officials, csm members should only lose their mandates if they are caught violating the eula or the csm agreement, end of story. a \"recall\" is the only other acceptable possibility, even then, such a provision must be made written and should not be retroactive.this kind of ad hoc justification for power grabs smacks of authoritarianism, and was certainly not for this kind of fruitless discussion that we put the council in its place.shame on whoever agrees with this, if you're willing to give up the power of your vote, you don't deserve the right to a vote in the first place."
"just to be clear, if a character is banned, the character cant post here? you are asking, does your ability to interact(as specified by ccp) with the community you represent, directly effect your ability to represent them, the csm and ccp?jeez.."
"what if the character has another account and his main account gets banned? as long as they have an account associated with them, bravo. honestly i think part of the responsibility lies of people who vote for candidates. choose wisely for people who aren't prone to be dramakings.this concept runs counter to what the csm was partially formed for to be a quasi-watchdog group to questionable ccp actions. if people are afraid to speak out for fear of bans and then losing their csm position, we're overall better off having ccp just invest the csm money to hire new staff."
"i disagree, everyone in responsible for their own actionsi would agree or disagree with removing someone depending on the reason for the ban. from what i've read this only gives the csm the option to remove a member, it isn't automatic. this means that both the forum moderation team and a group of the players peers must agree that the behaviour was inappropriate before anything would happen."
"no, it means one over-zealous forum moderator and a few csm members with an axe to grind can kick a legitimately elected csm member for potentially no reason at all.i think we all can agree that posting something completely heinous like 2girls1cup should be banned and possibly banned from csm for being such a douche, but you are forgeting that people get banned from the forums for small infractions and that will be exploited to unjustly kick someone out of the csm.i could go on and on with the holes in this topic. i mean you guys used irc or some chat program, right? wasn't lavista vista (i forget who) kicked from said chat? shouldn't he be kicked from the csm? what if my computer just doesn't like ie/firefox anymore and i can't log onto the forums for 2 weeks, should i get banned from csm?the number of ways csm members, forum users and ccp itself can abuse the system noted in the op should not be taken lightly.also i'd like to hi5 my gs brosefs."
"trudat honkus--i was referring to using this becoming a tool for recalling csm candidates. if you don't take a little time to research the post history of someone and get overcome by voter's remorse, well tough. six months is a limited time to suffer the distractions and petty power struggles this could bring. your csm may be a brat or may not always behave or advocate as you would, but hey, you're just getting you indirectly pay/vote for. :)"
"posting on the eve-online forums is completely unnecessary to the function of csm."
"it's only not required by csm members if they choose to not interact and discuss/evolve issues and ideas in the jita park or assembly hall forums.i suggest that this interaction is one of the important functions that csm members should undertake. the forums are where issues for the csm meeting agenda must be posted to get requisite number of votes or csm member support. i find it hard to follow your reasoning that posting in the forums is not needed by a csm member....take care,arithron"
"when the sycophants henchmen of jade unleash their diabolical plans, the virtuous colorful knights of goonswarm rise up to defend the innocents good, the fat, and the ugly."
"terrible idea. this is nothing more than a backhanded attempt to make the csm team fit the ideology of a couple of representatives who are looking to water down the aspects of the game that they aren't personally involved in."
"incorrect. there are a lot of forums on the internet whereby you can interact with people who play eve. many people detest these forums and the moderation of them and will avoid them. these people are voting eve players. one could make the argument that by focusing so much on these forums you're actually neglecting a large portion of the playerbase. anyone can post a thread on the assembly hall. it does not need to be a csm representative. i can say quite definitely from a position of experience that few others, if any, have that it has not been required for me, in the least, to be able to post on the eve-online.com forums. ever.:edit: actually it is required that you not be banned to submit your passport for candidacy. that may or may not be intentional. if you're someone like me you can simply ignore the forums until it comes time to submit your passport, as eventually someone's report clicking will stick."
"actually, issues and ideas posted on other forums, afaik, aren't binding on the csm and can't be put onto an agenda unless first posted in the assembly hall for 7 days, and then getting a csm support (posted) or 5% of voter's approval.however, if you feel that interaction with posters on issues and ideas in the assembly hall (or jita park) is not needed as a player representative on the csm, fair enough.we just have obviously diametrically-opposed viewpoints on what csm members should be doing...take care,arithron"
"representing eve players... i already addressed the assembly hall in that very same post.\"representing eve players\" and \"posting on the eve-online.com forums\" are mutually exclusive. nevermind the slew of other issues that's already been mentioned repeatedly by myself and others in this very thread."
"i agree that other forums are valuable for csm members to garner player opinions and the like. however, i must have read your post above before editing...i took it to mean that you didn't think it was needed for a csm member to interact and post on issues in the assembly hall at all (despite this being the place that issues must be posted to gather support).if this isn't what you meant, accept my apologies.i can see clearly that you are now posting on the forums on eve-o...take care,arithron"
"haha touche'! the thing being that i'm posting here out of choice. not out of necessity. i go very long periods of time without even reading these forums."
"you should post here more often! many of your ideas are interesting and show effort and prior thought. in the very least they get discussion going and other player's views and input.i look forward to working with you on the csm! (hopefully not from the position of alternate again)take care,arithron"
"what would you suggest as an alternative? i am very much in favour of a csm member being removed if they step outside the rules, in a derogatory or detrimental fashion to individuals and/or the community. and to echo gramtar's sentiment, i believe ccp wouldnt allow someone to be evicted from the council unjustly."
"i really would like to see this implemented.most of the players, i guess 90%, are unable to log in during day time.like myself, i always have to do some real planning in my training queues to calculate a full 24 hours of training. and i have to do the short skills during the weekends.this would release me (and a lot of other players) from the intensive planning.i also can agree with this kind of feature, although not as efficient as the first one.if i could chose... rather not the dual training. as said before, it slows down the training of all other skills.unless ccp makes it possible to do trainings with more than 1 character (on the same account) at a time...i totally agree, wrath. ccp should make work of this."
"i'm here supporting third part skill training macros with trojans"
"queued skill training would be great but dual is not neccessary."
"queued training is my choice"
"i'm not a big fan of the dual training idea but a single queued skill would be a great addition. people would still need to log in after each skill completion to at least add another skill to the queue, except now they can do it at a more convenient time, rather than when the skill ends.i do think though that if a skill queue is implemented, the next skill should only commence training if the account is active."

"i don't see why they do not already have this."
"it doesn't get bonuses from most ships - none of the ships that can fit it (motherships) have bonuses to ecmit costs tons of cap - it's a capital module; it should have capital cap costsit has a 30s cycle - 20 second duration, 5 minute (base) reactivation delay.it doesn't actually jam anything - how do you figure? jam strength of 25 should have good odds against most ships.it doesn't work on the one thing it'd be super-usefull against (drones), since they just insta-relock - they would ... after the 20 second jam cycle finishesit affects your own fleet members up to 27km away give or take - yes, it's an aoe weapon, and there's no magic making firendly ships immunegiven the high jam strength (compare it to an ecm burst ii at 7.2, and a well-skilled falcon at around 14 per jammer), i think the jam strength is pretty sizeable -- it's jam strength is higher than the sensor strength of a basic battleship. that means that, used properly, your fleet has a roughly 30 second turkey shoot at the beginning of a battle, with most of the opposing fleet unable to return fire. it can't perma-jam like a falcon can, but it can affect an entire blob unlike a falcon. i've not been in a position to use it, but it strikes me as a very useful fleet tool, and most of the issues you raise don't seem like issues."
"no ecm burst like the remote one is supposed to break locks which it does i've done it to miners on multiple occasions it really does work and it its supposed to cap you out if you are using it on an underside ship. a scorpain's bonus does apply to it if you bothered to check. it also doesn't use that much cap when you look at a battleships which is what its really ment for even those the tool tip doesn't say that's what its ment for.again this is a non issue because the op is misinformed."
"still wrong.however, i'll take this moment to point out. this module is so crap, people don't even know it exists.the module i am talking about is this onethe capital module you are talking about it this onethese are not the same module. seriously, go buy an ecm burst i and put it on a frig. it fits, it can be used...but it just sucks.edit: also, as one person apparently doesn't know - the ecm burst module does not jam. it only breaks target locks. there is no 20s jam. the affected just lose their locks and can immediately relock. also, ship bonuses either don't apply, some are bugged, or they only apply partially. as the ecm burst has the exact same range on my caracal as it does on my blackbird.it sucks so hard, you people have never even heard of it."
"again you didn't read what i said i said the scorpian bonus does apply to this module but the falcon/rook/blackbirds/kitsune/griffon don't, i dont know why you are so dense.ecm bust does break locks, it does work."
"actually, all you said was that the scorpion's bonus applies. you said nothing about others' not. so one assumed that you meant that ship bonuses in general work - which they don't.so, in any case, the ship bonuses are bugged, save for the scorpion.and, *sigh* yes, i know, it breaks locks. congratulations on your obviousness, cpt. obvious. the point is, it still blows. it takes a ton of cap, has a super-long cycle and doesn't jam...you know, basically, exactly what i said in the op?"
"i have seen it work many times, as i was the intended target on several occasions. did something happen to it in the last week or so that it doesn't work any more? or is it because it doesn't work every time when you want it to?"
"are you just trolling, now?i already said it works. i know it works. i'm just saying it is a sub-par module and in need of some love."
"no, i am not trolling. i am just responding to your rant in the op. it seems to work fine. it like other ecm is chance based. the t2 version has a 7.2 to all races. the multi craptastic spectral ecm hits around 8 with good bonuses. ecm racials and multis' are limited to targets locked and one module per target. the ecm burst hits everything.no troll. just wondering whats up."

"let's get a few things out of the way first before we start discussing the real issue(s) that plague eve.- ccp intend to release ambulation. ambulation is a fantastic idea, were it not for the fact that they spend more time and money on promoting something that won't be released for quite some time rather than fixing the real problems of eve. also ambulation is an experiment, intended to test the mechanics of their wod mmo.- what powers does the csm have other than the power to be ignored? so far we have seen very little concrete evidence that ccp actually will do anything the csm propose other than pretend they care.- the csm have been forbidded from discussing certain issues because ccp want to move on to more 'important' things and don't want to 'dwell' on issues they don't care about. the issues i am talking about are lag and disconnects.the csm is, obviously, not a revolutionary idea. the idea was implemented by sony in an attempt to save them from disaster and look where that led them. soe has become a company many people avoid simply because of the great work they have done over the years. they are experts at taking successfull mmo's and totally ruining them through lack of support and lack of care. as long as the customer pays sony are happy.i am beginning to see that ccp and sony share one very fundamental aspect, and that's neither care about their customers. how many people have proposed things that would help the game? how many people have asked ccp to solve really important issues rather than concentrate on attracting more players through unwanted expansions? ccp usually have a very good response to these. either they are very straightforward and say \"no\" or have some half baked excuse that the mechanic that has been proposed would break the game, prevent people from logging in, ruin experience, etc. of course these are ridiculous excuses and we all know this.the question is what future does the csm have? i know many people who never voted and will not vote because the csm has no power and ccp aren't listening. there are many people who can't play and ccp don't care about paying customers who need the help, so who are the csm for ccp to take time, effort and energy to lend an ear to?my point is not whining about ccp's utter contempt for us as players but to ask what future eve, the csm and our relationship with ccp have. do we need ccp to go down the path of soe and lose millions, possibly billions, before they learn players will punish them or are there ways we, the players, can make ccp listen? if not then what options do we have? if none then we can simply disband the csm as some failed experiment and accept that we are running around in a mill while ccp watch and take notes.i obviously trust ccp to show the same amount of care they have in the past and continue on their path of self-destruct, the same path sony took. but i would like to hear from the rest of the csm and all players in regards to this matter."
"nope. this thread will still be locked for trolling, though.csms were a sop to the community (and in particular to impress the mainstream media) after the various developer scandals, it was never intended to have actual power. all they can do is suggest changes, and ccp are free to act on them, one way or another, on their own discretion."

"your statement is incorrect. ccp are already working on reducing lag, they are in fact and have been dwelling on lag for a very long time. ccp has stated that they believe that lag is an important issue for them.this thread is pointless and telling ccp to do something they are already doing is also a waste of time."
"this whole line of argument is old, tired, and pretty clearly false. yes, ccp is a business, and yes their marketing department has some influence over what happens. but what precisely is the alternative you want to see - would you prefer that the game is silky-smooth and lag-free with no players and a bankrupt company running it? because from here, that looks like the alternative. i'll criticize some of their past decisions in a lot of fields, but i'm not such a fool as to believe that they can just overturn all of those decisions instantly and with no ill consequences. just because you don't want to make tough decisions does not prevent ccp from being required to make them. look at the issue of reloading all ammo at once, for example - i started the thread that the csm brought forward, so i think we can all agree that i'm for it. i regard their argument that it'll increase lag as a bit unlikely, but i don't fault ccp for making it. it's really easy to snipe from the sidelines, and to complain about not living in the best of all possible worlds. i think they're being too cautious and are making a bad decision because of it, but i won't be the one getting the \"fix teh lagz!\" whines if it turns out that they're not. just because you aren't getting what you want when you want it does not mean that their rationale for not giving it to you is bad. your whines don't have limitations, but their programmers do. the fact that ccp is working within those limitations does not mean that the csm has failed - quite the contrary, those limitations are the reason that the csm could possibly be successful. if ccp could make a game spring fully-formed from hammer's forehead, then they wouldn't need us to tell them what to do, they'd just do it. but because they have development cycles, limited manpower, and all the rest of that stuff, they can't do everything, and so they need to set priorities. this is the primary function of the csm in many ways - it sorts out the signal from the noise, and says \"players genuinely care about x, but y and z are just being flogged by a handful of loudmouths, ignore them\" to ccp. a year from now(i.e., a development cycle), we'll see the results of that. i'd like it faster, but i know that's either impossible or likely to give us another boot.ini issue from lack of testing. patience - all good things will come to those who wait."
"that is exactly... what i'm trying to hammer into these people's infernal thick skulls.stop whining and shut the frick up.... if you want to help then be constructive or gtfo and gb2wow.the csm are human beings just like the rest of us... they make mistakes just like the rest of us.. but at least they give a damn about us... and that's why the bother to put up with our whines and complaints and gnashing of teeth.heck i'd been tempted to dig in (except for my lack of age and time put into eve) but i couldn't tolerate half the stupidity i see that gets flung all over the place.people who sign up for the csm should be given a solid pat on the back for tolerating the trash that gets thrown around... agenda or not.. at least they are trying.give im credit for that.ps: herschel you runnin? i'd vote for yah ; o )"
"the csm is makin a difference. thing is, given development schedules, we won't see the fruits of this until next year. i am heartened by the responses from ccp about the value of the csm (and ultimately players submitting on assmbly hall) input. ccp are a company providing an enjoyable game for us to play. it's in their best interests (financially) to implement ideas that will enrich gameplay and make players stick about for more than 3 months paying subscriptions. since players might have ideas about what some good features are, it makes sense to give them a conduit (the csm) to express these to ccp.the csm acts as a clearing house for these ideas. those with merit are put forward for the consideration of ccp. it was clear from the last meeting that ccp was taking these ideas and using them to shape future expansions and development paths.one of the additional functions that the csm serves is to make sure that ideas and issues that reach an agenda are well constructed/defined and meet the criteria to be considered (player support/csm member support). an essential function in this is csm members interacting with players in the assembly hall and jita park (and additionally via other forums and channels). take care,arithron"
"ccp's ignorance is sometimes unbelievable. amarr swap ammo immediately and have the best snipe ships in eve. how many amarr only fleets participate in fights? ccp should stop pretending the csm mean anything and admit the csm are just a veil hung before our eyes in the hope we won't get even more angry with them for being blind and not playing the game.until ccp start listening to what we want rather than what they think we should want the csm and all proposals are a joke. ccp should rename to sony v. ii and simply admit the nonsense that goes on in the game."
"consider allowing fire-linking of turrets or launchers of the same type.have your seven tachyon laser turret act like a single turret that does x7 damage, and when you load it, it takes x7 of the ammo. i dunno, it might be a way to reduce db calls."
"i want to be able to type 4582045756674 letter walls of text in the help channel too for the lulz. imagine that! wouldn't it be great if you could type so many letters you could block out everyone else's chat?i will vote for this but i would change the topic to: \"i want to be able to spam at hearts content so can i have a permanent mute placed on me?\" that should make op happy, right?"
"anyone who wants to do that already can - shift-enter is a lolspammer's best friend. the worst part about that being that you can't mute them, because the text scrolls too fast for you to be able to get a clean right-click onto their name(which is mostly the fault of an error in how text channels work in eve, but that's a different topic). anything can be abused by morons - such is the nature of morons. you might as well at least let the legitimate users use it too, so that csm meetings(for example) don't have all this confusion of text limit vs done talking."
"also increase the limit on character names, and most especially ship names (this includes starbases and anchorable cans). you can't have the -a- fuer und wasser iii without, you know, the und wasser iii."
"may i ask why we need more isk sinks in particular?"
"(1) totaly nonsense. 100 or 1000 isk wouldn't change a thing, you would need to set it a lot higher to have an effect on lag situation. this beeing said, 10.000 isk per jump would limit the sandbox design of eve way to much, don't ya think? (2) sure it does. miners, mission runners, ratters and industrialists would be much less affected then traders,haulers, pvpers. (3) there you go. but why again do we need those isk sinks? people getting to rich in eve and we need more grinding ... yeah, thats it! ... no wait. more people grinding would mean less people pvping, right? less combats would mean less destructed stuff, right? i suck at maths, but wouldn't that lead to inflation and people whining for more isk sinks again?"
"maybe start by quadrupling empire sales taxes ... because all empires are all at war, right?try to think of ideas that don't involve creating more transactions that need to be tracked. work with the existing systems first if possible, makes it easier to implement and maintain."
"with all the hubbub about the nano-nerf and some of its motivation supposedly being it allows risk free combat, i think that the issue of combat outside stations should be addressed.the ability to enter combat outside stations then to redock in ships with reasonable tanks is currently abused by many players. here is a typical scenario:a player undocks from a station in a ship with a good tank (e.g. multiple plates and trimarks on a bs, or a carrier).the player enters combat, and is completely safe from almost any form of retaliation.this is practically risk free for players abusing this game mechanic. if any attempt is made to bait the player, as soon as he sees local spike or more hostile ships on scan / grid. he just de-aggresses will mostly have plenty of time to wait out his short aggression re-dock timer and dock.the only chance is if he can be 'bumped' away from the station, which is near impossible for many stations with huge docking radii. also if the speed nerf goes ahead, bumping will be near impossible even for stations with a small docking radius.this should be a really simple thing to fix imo, many ways todo it, a simple solution that comes to mind is just to increase the redock timer for stations after aggression. this will not stop players from undocking and re-docking in say haulers, as long as they do not aggress anything, but as soon as they shoot anything, they should not be able to re-dock for a much longer period of time, say 5 minutes, maybe more?thoughts?"
"i support this :d"
"several threads about increasing the docking timer already. throwing support in anyway though."
"this one as submitted to ccp in iceland - they're working on it."
"everyone station hugs... the difference here is when you agress, tank, and dock. i think anyone who gets involved with a fight, shooting or repping, you should lose docking rights for 5 mins. simple... period. the only time you can dock is if your ship blows and you're ejected to a pod... otherwise, wait out the 5 mins of your agressing actions.of course, this does not apply to npc's and missions."
"absolutely. i've posted much more strict penalties than this, but bottom line is that the current redock timer for ships that have flagged themselves is a joke. when pilots choose to engage, they should be required to live with the consequences.this should be called the 'empire griefer corp nerf', and it has my support."
"this would work, however, presumably it would also apply to the members of your corp currently in the npc corps?"
"given that some players are much richer than others, how do you plan to calculate this fee ?"
"please do not post spam - navigatorgive me for posting at my soon-to-be-deceased alt, sir.)"
"i have no knowledge of who or what is doing this... you'll have to take that up with our ceo.this is the assembly hall... a place to discuss ideas... personal attacks are meant for places elsewhere. unless you want to find your account banned or blocked... i suggest you keep that in mind.what i say here and elsewhere doesn't necessarily reflect the views of the ceo of the shadow cadre. (well duh)as far as tactics involved... the only ones who have left are people who joined to be industrialists... and then didn't appreciate getting dragged into a war dec for the foolish notion of a mining permit. while i do not personally agree with there decision as it is rather... not so good.i can't exactly stop them now can i.i can't control any one individuals actions. only my own.if you can't think that far... you have no business posting here.either you post something constructive... or you gtfo.which is why i'm even here in the first place... and i find it disturbing that your obviously ignoring the intention of my post... to prevent such things from happening and the abuse of the system.for you to overlook such an obvious thing for selfish intentions is nothing short of disgusting and insulting."
"that's why i'm asking for people to come up with ideas as to how that goes about.perhaps a direct percentage of your total wealth coupled with a direct ratio/colleration with the size of your corp.the idea is to penalize them... not bankrupt them.i'm not too good with algorithmic math. : o p"
"i don't think ccp would be so forgiving.this is the csm assembly hall.. not diplomatic or alliance discussions.take your business elsewhere.also remember... i'm not ceo... just a simple member of a simple corp.talk to him.... not me."
"not the first answer or acknowledgment of the problem in here so far. what gives? could we at least have an explanation as to why a t1 fitted rokh or an apoc out ranges and out tracks a t2 fitted tempest while also being able to fit an omni dd tank?i'm fine with being a glass cannon, but the cannon part doesn't exactly exist anymore."
"hows this for an idea.when you log out your ship never disappears from space, instead it becomes unscanable after 1 minute without agression, 15 with agression."
"yay, clogged up gates!just imagine jita"
"they still attempt to warp off, just don't disappear after 1/15 minutes"
"was thinking about that just before and thought of something that could be an improvement. instead of the current; ship disappears after 30 sec if there is no aggression before he logs.change to a 30sec timer from the time he logs, where the server checks to see if there has been any aggression up to the end of the timer.would make a considerable portion of logoffskis fail as opposed to the way it is now and also still not screw over legitimate dcs. you'd still emergency warp if not pointed and still disappear if nothing finds you in 30sec (or however long the current timer is)."
"this"
"this is not an issue. missile ships are fine in their role and caldari have plenty of gun ships."

"reykjavik (reuters) - iceland seized control of its biggest bank, kaupthing, on thursday to try to shore up its banking system and halted all trade on its stock market.the state has now taken over three of the nation's major banks after landsbanki and glitnir were put under state control earlier this week.the stock exchange suspended trading in all shares, citing unusual market conditions. the exchange, part of the nasdaq omx group, said trade would not resume until monday.at the centre of a financial hurricane which has claimed several of the world's biggest banks, iceland's prime minister has warned of the risk of national bankruptcy.home to just 300,000 people, iceland epitomised the global credit boom that turned to bust. its banks expanded dramatically overseas, investors took large positions in its high-yielding currency and foreign money poured into local projects.the central bank has tried then abandoned attempts to prop up its battered currency and it is seeking an emergency loan from russia.this is not the subject of this thread however. the point is has it effected your game play.will it alter your plans for the forseeable future.are we to see less multi account players."

"the primary purpose for the titan doomsday was, to decrease lag, through removing a part of the player field that is in system.one of the \"problems\" seems to be that \"lag\" after a titan doomsday, is not really decreased, due to the amount of wrecks that a successfull doomsday creates.so why not, after the initial \"powerful\" titan doomsday, which creates all the wrecks, let the titan immediately create a second \"tiny\" doomsday, just enough to destroy, all the wrecks/pods on the field, which should give a real reduction of the lag.a side effect, of the second doomsday would also be that removing the wrecks (and their contents), would be a deterrent for \"misusing\" the titans doomsday, to \"doomsday\", small gangs of 2-10 peeps, due to not being able to loot afterwards..."

"hey darius,nice idea. i had an idea a while ago that might dovetail nicely with this one. it's on my webpage.it's not completely the same, as it's still probeable, but it also has some limited defenses. tell me what you think, plz."
"i love the idea, but i think a blackops bs should be required to maintain it with something like a warfare link module. have the blackops bs capacitor maintain the shield. when you activate the module from outside the cloak it will take half your capacitor and regenerate the shield for x hours. this gives you a chance to both probe the base by probing the blackops bs fueling it but also stops the attacker from having to bring fuel in. fueling stuff sucks. only allow a blackops bs carry one of these by having it be a launchable item from the module that only a blackops bs can fit. that would put more of those ships at risk and have a larger risk/reward to deploying one of these."
"so you want a free cloak on all your ships without any drawback of fitting one?if so, than very big no...if you want a ship maintenance array, and a gsc that cannot be probed by themselves, but do not provide any protection for ships and can be anchored anywhere in system...then maybe.the most protection i would be willing to support, would be something like a dead space like protection (decreasing chance of being probed out like in a mission spot)."
"what if it only cloaked unoccupied ships, sort of as an impromptu hangar? for that matter, you could even give it actual hangar space, although not a lot."
"i see your point. these things would then need to be expensive enough so that wouldn't be a viable option. what i'm really concerned about is lowsec being riddled with these things, where every pirate corp has a bunch in each system.edit: :page3:"
"perhaps to prevent people from putting up too many of these things there could be a limit to how many one character can anchor, which would be determined by some silly, high-rank skill. so a maximum of five per character.edit: and the skillbook should be expensive."

"the idea of a supply depot behind enemy lines is a nice one, but being cloaked while you're using it is just too prone to abuse. i think if you remove the whole cloaking thing, it works well. make the structure itself unscannable/probable, but no cloaking while using it, which means you don't hang out there unless you want to be probed out and destroyed. it'd keep usage to quieter times and less of something you'd be able to use during actual battles.without the cloaking stuff i'd support it in a heartbeat, but so long as it can be used as a place to hide, can't say i like it."
"i like both the original idea and this addition. no fueling needed, but an extra role for black ops. nice!"
"like the general idea since its fresh.its pretty much to hide it since you always see who's in local and whenever someone has their ship outside the cloaking range you can scan it in 20 sec to find the grid. and then its just a matter of waiting in a cloaker to spot where ships go.what about having a pirate structure in a gas cloud or asteroid belt which makes it undectable by probing but also receiving damage from the cloud or belt. then you have to rep the structure back up and and ships in there also have to be repped or they simply explode in time. (a couple of days?)"
"like i was hinting at with the distance requirements... you could have one for being unable to park one within a certain radius of other cloaked pos's... something like within 10 au's or something... maybe 5."
"i would enjoy this even more if those inside the cloak of the pirate base didn't show up in local."
"sounds interesting."
"yeh i know what you mean this cloaking thing is a bit far fetched, if you made it unprobable/unscannable then people would be less likely to abuse it. in fact you should make them bright pink and call it a bungadoo there's a new thread for you."

"this could work if you also had a pos module that allowed the defenders to scan for these types of pos.make the scan take a significant amount of time[2-3 days], and give the cloaked pos owner a timer so that he knows when the scan is going to end.this way you can clear old pos structures, and the aggressors have to keep moving their operation around.otherwise i don't see it being a reasonable idea"
"the only suggestion i would add to this is alternative method for finding these structures in space.have these structures show up as \"unknown\" anomalies through exploration, exactly the same as a combat site hit, but give them a very low signature where a very determined prober may need to spend several hours (6+?) to scan a well placed structure down.this way you introduce a risk that a general explorer might get very lucky (or unlucky?) while looking for exploration sites.it gives a determined hostile the tools to track down over time a structure.and it means that the person deploying the structure has to be very careful of where they deploy your covert base to ensure its more than 5au away from any celestial (so to be outside onboard ship scanner range)."
"both the arguements re fueling and disintegration don't have to be mutually exclusive. perhaps the way to work it would be you can get it anchored but it won't online without a new fuel. make it small and yes, expensive (did like the idea industrialist make it from reactions. let's get everyone involved. perhaps an 8 moon mineral reaction?) and then you fill the structure before onlining. this will be your first and only time to fill it... if you fill it to max it will last for the maximum duration otherwise it'll pop out of existence when the fuel goes out?"
"this sounds like a good idea, it's worth a discussion."
"i can agree with this."
"signed/"
"sorry to say but this gets a big no in my book, when you fly the big pretty shiny ships you take the big risks, i fly a carrier and fly it under the presumtion that there is a good chance i might loose it every time i undock it or move it from the pos shileds, just because i have a tank and fighters doesnt make me any less vulnerable to a small gang then a freighter, all it takes it a tackler to hold me down and someone to neut my capactior and i'm as good as gone, so sorry no high sec jump ins for jump freighters, you have to share the risk like the rest of us"
"i could not disagree with this proposal more strongly. it's not supposed to be easy. there's supposed to be risk. people who want to play a game on god mode never cease to amaze me."
"your argument is moot when you want to introduce pirate faction towers which are unprobable."
"pirate towers with inherent risk built into them. to be used in 0.0 where there is no artificial safety net. there's also within the idea the concept of periods of probablility. your argument is moot when you compare apples to oranges."
"i would support this if empires then treated all cynos in their hi-sec space as an illegal act and concord came along and killed any ship generating a cyno and the ship jumping to it.100% risk for 100% safety seems fair to me"
"why complicate things, just make a bs sized hauler class.just like a normal hauler, price around 50-150m isk etc. a simple stepping stone towards the freighters.if you want to do fancy jumping cloaking omghax ships, make a t2 variant."
"as an alternative to what? posting on the eve forums? posting on another forum? any other forum? email? evemail (when fixed). talking in game? there are a slew of alternatives to using the eve-online.com forums when it comes to communicating with people who play eve. re: ccp allowing it... that would need to be addressed internally by ccp. this isn't a thread recommending that ccp be able to intervene and save a csm member. it's not a thread saying that ccp should be able to remove csm members. it's a thread requesting that via some magical against-ccp-policies mechanism the csm discover when a member has been temp banned so that they can then decide to vote them out of the council, based on circumstances for which the representative will have not real ability to defend themselves. it's a thread requesting that the ccp moderation team, which has deemed itself beyond the purview of the csm in any way, be in the position of deciding not just who can post on their awfully moderated forums, but also who can serve as a representative. that's just plain silly."
"a some what theatrical representation some of which i would actually agree with, unfortunately it's the parts you seem to be deliberately ignoring that would swing my support for the the issue. within reason, i wouldnt be in favour of removal of a player representative based on constructive interaction with ccp, i would be in favour of the option of removing a representative who cant interact with other members of the community on e-o within the guidelines given by ccp.this suggestion so far is the best to this ends, so i'll ask again, do you have a better alternative?"
"the players elect the csm representatives, and the players should be the only ones with the power to remove a csm representative. ccp should have no power to remove csm reps, because that would completely compromise the entity's independence and ability to provide input without fear of ccp shutting off lines of communication by banning a csm rep."
"what is he ignoring?why is a forum banned representative a problem?these questions have still not been answered."
"how bout the alternative is not changing something that works as-is?"
"i'm not sure i understand why a temp ban on the eve-o fora -which are wholly separate from the game itself- should warrant removal from the csm. your idea is beyond idiotic."
"a better alternative is nothing. if it 'aint broke, don't fix it."
"has my support. you carry a responsability. i don't see how people find getting banned \"easy\" if you keep a civil tone at all times."
"\"civil\" is completely subjective. i'd also like to remind you people that these are forums for a spaceship game where you kill people. dumbing down the conversation to the level of the sickening repeated pretend niceties should not be a desired end result for any competent moderation team."
"the responsibility of csm is not to be a shiny, perfect person. that falls on the shoulders of the moderators and devs. csm are normal people that are elected by other normal people to try and help fix the game.the csm is not meant to be a pedestal, but unsurprisingly, certain egotistical people have turned it into just that - a position of power where no power was meant to exist, nor should it.a temporary ban means that the offense was not heinous enough to remove them from the population of eve. it is a slap on the wrist, and is usually a completely subjective judgment call.the only case where this should even be considered is on permanent bans of the account. this clearly makes sense because they have had their ability to contribute to the game removed, full stop.it does not matter if a person gets along with the others or the rest of the eve-o community. what matters is that they were elected by said community. if you don't like him, the solution is as simply as common democracy: don't vote for him next round. saves lots of unnecessary drama."
"-1, naivenobody is perfect but it doesn't hurt to try."
"i don't find it theatrical at all. let me break down the facts for page 7.1) ccp policy will not allow them to discuss bans with anyone but the person who has been banned. this means the council will never know that one of their members has been banned because guess what? there's no reason for them to inform the council, nor is there any activity of the council that is required which would make this apparent. nor should there be.2) the forum moderation policies were placed by ccp beyond the purview of the csm. this means that the above policy cannot be altered or even questioned so that the recommendation in this thread can even remotely become a reality.3) as per the example i posted in detail of my own situation, it can be seen that people can be banned for items that are quite trivial. 4) ccp has given no guidelines for how representatives should interact. this is mostly because their own mechanisms are either broken or were not up to snuff. it was only a week ago that the csm even got a section on the forums.5) allowing council members the leverage to remove each other will only create more silly situations like this thread. situations where people who have a bone to pick with other council members will seek to consistently passive-agressively find ways to manipulate their removal, rather than working on what they were elected to do. perhaps we should have csm survivor and we should vote someone off every week? last man standing wins eve! in this scenario had cooler heads not prevailed at least one council member would not have made it through the term this first session. while i think the result would have been a net positive, it would have disenfranchised their supporters.now you claim the suggestion is the best there is... the best there is to solve what problem? i don't have an alternative because i prefer to find solutions to problems rather than create solutions and try to manufacture problems to fit it. game account bans already warrant removal from the council by ccp. this problem has already been solved.this is not the csm's responsibility in any way. the council does not and will not have the resources or ability to actually follow through on it and it is not a need. i'm not sure how much more succinctly it could be put."
"i am well aware of the potential draw backs of this, this is why i have constantly ask you to provide a better alternative. but clarifying that on the ccp provided media (forums/game), community representatives are required to interact with the community they represent in a manner consistent with the ccp specified rules is much too important a subject to simply ignore. btw, this isn't a fact. guidelines are provided here for interacting with other members of the community (applies only on e-o ofc.)"
"everyone is well aware of the potential drawbacks. that is why we keep asking \"what is the problem in the first place?\" that needs to be resolvedwhat is the problem that needs to be fixed?you're misunderstanding the original statement."
"a better alternative for what? there's no problem.that link is the forum rules... the forum and the csm are mutually exclusive, by the design of the ccp forum team. the only standing rule for a csm representative's behavior is that they not violate the eula which would result in a ban, which would result in removal. a rule that already exists and a valid one as it would be pretty hard to represent a game you can't play because you cheated or said something terrible like a racist comment.the guidelines i was referring to are regarding (as i said) how representatives should interact. ccp has not provided the tools for this... that is a fact. the council had to create its own mailing list, its own website to publish the minutes... ccp did not.the only thing that link provides is rules for posting on the eve-online.com forums. that has nothing to do with the council whatsoever."
"quis custodiet ipsos custodes?we voted the csm candidates into office. let's not give the forum moderation team the ability to remove them. it's a one year position."
"6 months."
"the good thing about jade is that its motives are so poorly hidden that you really have to be dumb to not see through them."
"this was originally posted by ccp greyscale in features and ideas discussion and i would like to get support for this so that its is not lost in the pile of paper work that eve development can become.the original thread is here"
"the main purpose of the csm is to bring ideas forward to ccp, not to repeat ideas that ccp already has. it has 8 pages, mostly of support, and i'd bet that it'll be included in the next appropriate expansion. i like the proposal, but it isn't something that the csm needs to concern itself with unless someone has something to add."
"single skill queue is pretty much perfect, anything beyond that is just benefiting the lazy."
"skill queues have already been discussed with ccp at the first meeting in iceland. someone getting their computer hacked because they were cheating does not constitute an emergency issue imo. ccp has received feedback."
"the skill-queue system should have been implemented yesterday - enough said"
"there should definatly be some sort of mechanic put into place for lining up skills to train 1 after the other, now if people are worried about people cancelling the accounts and just letting them train then what could be done is to just make it so that when you de-activate your account you simply stop training skills period, thats how it works in every other game, if your not paying to play you cant gain experience, this is how it should be for eve as well regardless of if there are skill ques or not"
"with the colapse of the iceland banks and with uk goverments sueing the banks for 1bill will eve continue to play even tho the game and team are based there and have no access to funds ??"
"oh my gosh oh my gosh the sky is falling the sky is falling the sky is falling!run for cover!!!!!!no offense man... but that's what your screaming in your post.and its a waste of time.all your doing is making it worse by causing panic or inducing \"fear\" with the general trend.life will go on... and i'm quite sure eve online will be there waiting for you."
"it's 20bil fyi and gordy's demanding it in \"british money\". v0v i'm sure we'll all be playing spaceships just fine. in the future i'd recommend putting your money in a bank that actually guarantees your deposits instead of taking a gamble on a foreign bank that doesn't and shaking your fist about it after the fact."
"well i hope we do continue playing ! fly safe !"
"eve has one advantage some other locations do not have: it's multinational. it could easily repackage everything and head to it's facilities in the usa, london, or taiwan (iirc).ccp will continue. with multinational income, i don't think there's anything to worry about. if there is, i'm sure that's their first concern."
"supported - missions are broken"
"voting yes for losing probes due to dc/lag/crash."
"i think this a good idea but it would break eve is every player could create unique items.personally i would like to see some additional tools on the manfacturing side. one tool that i have been wishing for is a manfacturing container where you drag and drop your bpo's that would rollup the mineral and build times and could be built using one factory slot instead of having to run 7 really fast jobs in tandum.the tool would be a something like a fitting window for ships and would pop out the frigs with the mods already fitted to the ship.now that would be very nice."
"delete, sorry"
"got my full support"
"locked at request of op."
"your main argument seems to be the ability to compress high-sec ore. just wondering why one would need the orca for that purpose. wouldn't it be much easier to implement the possibility to use compression blueprints inside stations like another poster already suggested?that way one could mine veldspar in high-sec, transport is to a station with a factory slot, compress it and then transport it to 0.0 to be decompressed.just wondering why the orca comes in to play here.(all for an orca btw , but failing to see why it would be the best solution for this specific problem.)"
"supported for sure a empire baby rorqual for those people who want to fly a rorqual but dont have the skills yet"
"hurr, forgot to support"
"i absolutely agree with this idea."
"having a little reminder is always helpful to not slip up again."
"so, and? i was never even talking about how long it jams or it even does. i was just comparing the chance it has to work along with the other ecms'. it is working as intended. just not the way you want it to. its a trade off. instead of jamming one target for a period of time you affect a number of targets by breaking their locks. so whats the problem."
"1. it works as intended - it breaks target lock2. if all the ecm boats bonuses worked with it it would be overpowered3. if it cost less cap it would also make it overpowering as well as lowering the cycle time on it. if they made the changes to it your asking for it would make it the new ew of choice for solo ganking. imagine a cheap (cap wise) ecm going off requiring no lock before effecting the target ship"
"i didn't request all those changes. i requested one change, and listed a few possibilities.if it's expensive and slow & unbonused - at least have it jam.if it's slow & unbonused & doesn't jam - make it cheap.if it's expensive & slow & doesn't jam - gimme my bonuses!in short - it's too 'pre-nerfed'."
"what are you guys *****ing about? instead of saying oh i want lag free battles, whine whine whine, try posting ideas to fix it or shut up. fact is they are doing a great job. 10 sec mod delay would be a god send in fleet battles. past that, you guys miss all that info on stackless io, and possible hpc systems, as well as 64 bit clients and servers running 3.0 ghz dual cores, with 16 gigs of ram. i dont see the issue, jita with 1400 players in it still responsive. 1100 man fleet battles with 20 to 40 sec mod lag. i don't see the issue, and the promise of it getting better with there plans right up where everyone can see them in the dev blogs.you guys forget yourself, 2 years ago you couldn't cram 400 people into a system without it crashing, your talking about 1000's of calculations a min, each gun, each missile, each drone, each ship. the type of dmg, resists, ammo type, rof. and 1000's of more calc's that have to be done by the server. the server is running better then ever, if you want to keep smacking ccp, then make your own mmo that supports the kind of play style and 40,000 plus players online on a single server, and show them how its done. is eve perfect? is stackless python the best code they could have used? no but that doesn't mean bash them, and act like they have done you some wrong. they are doing the best they can, and tbh, its damn good. so stop sticking your nose up at them and offer things that could help, not just the same old ***** thread of fix lagggg omg the laggggg, or quit *****ing, they have shown us all how they have reduced lag, and they don't need the poeple in this thread to ***** at them all the time. as its already been said, you make the server so it can support 1000 man fleet battles then people will try to stuff 1400 people into a system, you dont want lag, make sure to keep your fleet battles to 300 a side or less and you should be just fine.less *****ing, more constructive posts."
"oh, and another thing regarding fw: please, please, please change the logic that spawns complexes at dt. in fact, change it for normal exploration, too. make them respawn immediately, or an hour after capture, or twenty-four hours later, or really anything other than at only one specific time per day."
"then they are short-sighted and foolish. the more people who vote, the more power the csm has because it is clearly representing a larger portion of the player base. if 90% of the player base voted and brought in candidates who advocated no pve content, that eve should be 100% pvp - then ccp would seriously need to sit down and make some decisions about the direction of the game or risk alienating a massive percentage of the player base... who might then choose to take their entertainment euro/dollar elsewhere.of course the issues are never quite that cut and dried. but the fact remains that in eve as well as in rl, the more people who vote, the more representative is the result. if you don't vote then you don't really have a leg to stand on if you say that the elected individuals don't have power or don't represent you."
"i agree, i should be banned. i'm only trolling. please ban me together withpoor mm guyasking the exact same i'm asking but in a different way going to get banned for trolling.trollingi wholeheartedly support.trollingi do not support.walls of textin chat channels.who cares?i don't fly these ships.so, when are we all going to get banned? most of the things posted by the csm themselves can be seen as troll because they create angry arguments by people who on either side. make drake draconis a gm, he will solve all the flaming in caod!as we can see lag is not, and i repeat not, a tired old discussion. if it is and people deserve to be banned for it then i recommend we start with the 'trolls' in the 2 page thread started by praetor novak.what you missed was me asking whether the csm had any effect on ccp's policies. i am not complaining about lag but feel free to whine about it anyway. i want to know what the csm have, will and could achieve. the only thing sony achieved was nothing, is that what has been achieved so far or has more? drake draconis spare me your flaming. your pointless ranting is unwanted as my thick skull just found loads of people needing a ban under your wise guidance.also if we are to 'shut up' and let ccp do their job then why does the csm exist? i assume that is something that was never thought about prior to poasting.in all fairness i am angry and frustrated but this is a serious question. for example, when it comes to the nano nerf, how much of an effect did the csm have on ccp's decision to nerf what?p.s. if all you can do is troll, please go to caod, trolling is welcome there and be a little child and poast with your 'main' instead of hiding behind some veil pretending your opinion means anything when you are scared of revealing who you actually are."
"are you intending to run for the csm or are you trying to get the csm's attention in regards to an issue?"
"the poll threads are hardly \"trolling\", they're a patch on a forum mechanic that has only been implemented partially, and they're a very useful one at that. it was, and is(albeit on the back burner) the biggest issue to most players, and having a concrete method of telling what people thought about it was a massively valuable thing. and your last example is just juvenile. i think drake is being a bit of jerk asking for your ban, but if those are the worst other threads you can find, maybe he's right. what they have achieved at this point is minor - as i said, a typical development cycle is a year long, and their first submission to ccp was three months ago. as for what they will and could achieve, that's obviously much greater. i expect the csm to have a major role in shaping ccp's vision of what players want and how we want it, as well as providing a useful vector for cool new ideas on how things could work. ccp has taken player suggestions and put them into the game before - i believe that they directly attributed the stab nerf to a player, for example - but this provides a mechanism for them to do so in a better fashion. who said anything about shutting up? i said to have a bit of faith and a bit of patience. i'm certainly not opposed to complaining(just look at my forum history), just to complaining done ignorantly."
"i'm being a jerk because i'm sick and tired of seeing morons who just go around whining and being deconstructive when they should be getting off there fat lazy asses and actually helping out instead of throwing a fit and doing not a damn thing about it.all your doing is repeating the same thing for the thousandth time... not to mention annoying the ccp by having them move this thread if that's any evidence.so forgive me for being annoyed at the foolishness of some individuals.not to mention the fact that you ranting about me being made gm so i can go ban the whole lot of you folks is only proving my case in light of your attitude on the manner.and even then i wouldn't take the job... a little too much pressure for that kind of standard.few could even meet it as it is.... even myself.as far as you complaining about the actual progress of the csm... if you had bothered to pay attention and think things through before you even started flapping your gums you'd see that this is not a \"do it right now\" type scenario... this stuff takes time for ccp to resolve.most people here always assume its a quick fix... yet they completely forget that they have no idea what really makes eve work... the programming... the development... the research.. the loads.all you do is just complain and whine and what not.the csm's purpose is to filter the noise down to a few people as opposed to a few thousand.its easier to get information... this means you need to vote.... to insure to make sure you get the right people for the right job.as far as you throwing a fit and hinting/implying that the csm is a waste of time... think about where that would go next... csm gets shut down.. now you have nothing... except a bunch of annoyed dev's who dont have the time to read every-single-stinking-post on these boards.let alone to listen to people who think they know best and have it made in the shade when only a small portion do.so yes... i am that jerk.... the guy who shines spotlights in your face to say hey.... knock it off.sorry if you took offense to the \"you should be banned\".because honestly.... your just 1 more to the pile of noise that has nothing better to do then to kick dirt in the face of csm.like i've been saying.. you want it fixed? get involved... stop complaining..and do something about it.and don't expect it to be done over night.it could very well be a year.... better that..then nothing at all.so i'm sorry if i seem harsh... but you kinda get tired of seeing the repetitiveness of \"omgwthcsmsuxkthxbai\""
"well with that type of attitude no one, and i mean no one one will want to respond with a constructive post. if you are going to be all emo about a video game you need a break. your posts and threads just brings out the trolls and flames. you are creating the problem.as to the op. dude you need to understand what the csm is for. it is to filter out the noise to have a couple good ideas that actually would make things a bit better than sifting through thousands of emo rants and add enhanced misfits to get an idea what to do next.the lag, they know, they get it. they are working on it."
"you posted didn't you? constructively and you read my post. guess i don't scare the \"thinkers\" away. ^_^i have a life by the way.... full time job... good one at that.... taking care of my parents whom suffer much in this world (health wise). if i took this game too seriously.. i'd play it 24/7 and be posting up a storm.if you can think of a better way to get the point across and to rally the people who just \"read\" and don't say much... be my guest.small talk is cheap.... i guess that's why i tend to be long winded.sorry if that bugs you... but that's who i am.nice to see someone gives a rip tho.. so you have my respect..and my regards.o7"
"i'm sooo sorry for not having 20000 more noobs who want to play eve for a couple of months and, after checking how hard the learning curve really is, they abandon for wow-like games.pathetic.eve is all about patience. those who disagree with this game mechanics, please leave and stop bothering about changing what a lot of people before than you sweated very hard and is enjoying right now."

"i'm being a jerk because i'm sick and tired of seeing morons who just go around whining and being deconstructive when they should be getting off there fat lazy asses and actually helping out instead of throwing a fit and doing not a damn thing about it.all your doing is repeating the same thing for the thousandth time... not to mention annoying the ccp by having them move this thread if that's any evidence.so forgive me for being annoyed at the foolishness of some individuals.not to mention the fact that you ranting about me being made gm so i can go ban the whole lot of you folks is only proving my case in light of your attitude on the manner.and even then i wouldn't take the job... a little too much pressure for that kind of standard.few could even meet it as it is.... even myself.as far as you complaining about the actual progress of the csm... if you had bothered to pay attention and think things through before you even started flapping your gums you'd see that this is not a \"do it right now\" type scenario... this stuff takes time for ccp to resolve.most people here always assume its a quick fix... yet they completely forget that they have no idea what really makes eve work... the programming... the development... the research.. the loads.all you do is just complain and whine and what not.the csm's purpose is to filter the noise down to a few people as opposed to a few thousand.its easier to get information... this means you need to vote.... to insure to make sure you get the right people for the right job.as far as you throwing a fit and hinting/implying that the csm is a waste of time... think about where that would go next... csm gets shut down.. now you have nothing... except a bunch of annoyed dev's who dont have the time to read every-single-stinking-post on these boards.let alone to listen to people who think they know best and have it made in the shade when only a small portion do.so yes... i am that jerk.... the guy who shines spotlights in your face to say hey.... knock it off.sorry if you took offense to the \"you should be banned\".because honestly.... your just 1 more to the pile of noise that has nothing better to do then to kick dirt in the face of csm.like i've been saying.. you want it fixed? get involved... stop complaining..and do something about it.and don't expect it to be done over night.it could very well be a year.... better that..then nothing at all.so i'm sorry if i seem harsh... but you kinda get tired of seeing the repetitiveness of \"omgwthcsmsuxkthxbai\""
"well with that type of attitude no one, and i mean no one one will want to respond with a constructive post. if you are going to be all emo about a video game you need a break. your posts and threads just brings out the trolls and flames. you are creating the problem.as to the op. dude you need to understand what the csm is for. it is to filter out the noise to have a couple good ideas that actually would make things a bit better than sifting through thousands of emo rants and add enhanced misfits to get an idea what to do next.the lag, they know, they get it. they are working on it."

"the timers exist to provide defenders with a means to defend themselves against attacks that are off their normal timezone. that being said i largely agree that planetary colonies (maybe even lunar colonies given the moon meets certain criteria, like no mooon minerals & around a gas gaint hehe) should be where the actually occupation and sovreignity lies. but this will mean that planets should have a mechanism beyond capital ships blowing up the station etc (one method but shouldn't be the rewarding one).no i think a protracted siege of the system/surrounding systems that involves things like blockades (blockade runners are useful here) and pushing towards smaller squadron level combat being useful means of fighting a war. sure you can drop your capitals next to the hub and try to take it down in a classic manner, but the hub should be something that take an investment to setup. so why not just blow it to bits? because once it runs out of critical supply a, b, or c (slaves, water, or holofilms :) ) the population gets fed up and lays down its arms allowing anyone to come and take the hub over with a few marines :). another option may be an assault on the hub and planet itself using your own marines as ammo against theirs, could have a basic rock-paper-scissors mechanic where marine type a is good against b show is good against c who is good against a. just some thoughts.csm how did it fair in the meeting 2 weeks ago?"

"there is a fundamental problem: it can be abused by squatters and farmers. basically this will make it to farmers can, with out fear, drop one of these and not need to fit a cloak, and be invulnerable. i mean, catching farmers is already hard enough. so i would want something included to make this not just, a ratting station."
"man i get sick of hearing how farmers will use this and that to their advantage as a point against any good ideas being brought forward. it's a really bad case cutting off your nose to spite your face why would you let farmers dictate how you play the game(rhetorical)."
"so basically a magic giant secure container that cloaks ships around it and allows me to refit? hell ya where can i get 50 of these?i would prefer it not to be a cloak shield (if you want to cloak, fit a cloak) but would support an anti-probe shield with an extremely tiny initial signature radius that increased as more /larger ships were \"protected\". this will provide small groups of players, who want to make a limited break into 0.0, a viable option of doing so. to wage asymmetric war you would simply use more of these devices to protect larger groups than could be safely accommodated by a single unit.if the unit functioned like a gsc in terms of being able to assemble it in station, fill it with a few days supply of fuel, throw it in an industrial or blockade runner and then anchor it up... that would be cool. keeping the combined fuel and item storage amount under the size of a regular gsc prevents it from becoming another hauler's exploit as they double up on fuel / minerals.i like the idea of not being able to anchor it anywhere and would definitely favor at least a 5000 km no-anchor zone to prevent pinheads from putting it off gates and thus using it as a gate / station camp mechanism. i don't think any other anchoring restrictions should apply other than the ones already in place for anchoring gsc's."
"i would go back to 0.0 for this.would also make using black ops easier. you can jump to a system and refuel at the cloaked pos."
"allow me to respond to your rhetorical question. how could you change the concept so it isn't super effective fro ratting. answer: design the anchorable so once you enter it, you are only cloaked for so long, say 5 mins, then once you leave the structure, you cannot cloak for long enough to be probed out if you don't move. this would still allow for this spot to be a pounce, and place to refit with out being a hiding spot where you can't be probed.just an example of how you could make it not as beneficial to farmers."
"heh kasheen i'm sure the flaws would get ironed out eventually like everything else so why break a format? ;)"
"when jf can jump to high-sec they become invulnerable? most of them get caught with their pants down undocking in 0.0 or low-sec or get ap ganked in high-sec. it's inconsistent when they can jump out high-sec but can't jump back.besides just like pirate faction towers you can tweak this idea around in a way that you need high-standing with the high-sec faction you're jumping to and have to be in a deccable corp."
"never ceases to amaze me when people take potshots and attempt to disrupt valid discussions by subtle personal attacks.jump freighters have a great deal of risk... if they are allowed to jump directly to high sec... the risk only gets slightly less.in reality all you'd have to do is war'dec the corp that owns the freighter and you can nail the target as it arrives without much trouble.unless its a npc... then you have a valid point of riskless there.either way... all i see is 2 groups... one who want's less frustration as they are going to and fro 0.0 to high sec.and a bunch of gankers who want meatier targets.if its going to be a problem... then have a \"cyno\" tax for jf's crossing into empire space.. after all.. its the only capital ship allowed to come in. (unless i didn't count the roqual (sp?).you could even use charters... and make them verrrrrrry pricey... where you could avoid the fee by taking the \"risk\" in low-sec."
"no, it isn't. you can jump to lowsec, you can jump to nullsec, but you cannot jump into highsec. it's not about where the ship originates, it's about where the cyno is. the only thing the jumpdrive cares about is there being a cyno in range, not where it (the jumpdrive) currently is."
"hi there forum people.this is basically 2 suggestions/issues which is bugging me.1. being able to set pos to use alliance wide standings apply as well as corporations. also, a corporation with a different standing than alliance should take the alliance standing. (this could also be applied to outposts). this doesn't have to be default settings, but optional settings to make it easier. as far as i have understood, pos and outpost actual standings are corp to corp based, and with lack of standing exchange system and limited standing slots it's room for improvements. this would improve:a. nbsi alliance corps don't have to put every corp into the friendly list to make their pos not attack unwanted targets.b. nrds alliances will be able to set their pos to shoot reds, even if the standings are not towards corporations. c. all alliances can have alliance wide standing, and due to standing slots don't have to set standing to every corp, instead only need to set standing towards other alliances.2. launch a pos for yourself or being able to assign a pos/parts of it to a specific person. this could be done in the equipment management tab. the settings here could only be changed by using an administration password set. clarification: you would need the administration password to make tower or parts of it set to individuals and also to take it back. this would improve:a. security when building/researching, since you could keep bpo in your own hangar at station instead of putting it into corp hangar and security for corporations don't have to give access to bpo storage divisions in corp hangar for members to be able to research.b. \"safer\" docking of super capitals. c. this could be used to make different hangars personal hangars. i.e. a few persons sharing a pos in a good ratting systems, while dropping loot into their own hangar.d. easier to allow corp usage of pos as they can not unanchor it and steal it."

"adding complexity, cost and time to fueling pos (making fuel items, also requiring factory slots iirc) = do not want."
"where is complexity?it is a needed feature"
"if you read all the responses in the ideas thread you'll see that many of the players running large pos operation, mainly in 0.0 are concerned the additional logistics steps in order to get all the components to a central point for manufacture of fuel rods, which in essence are just containers for the pos depletables with no benefit beyond removing a simple ratio calculation for the individual items.this is compounded by the fact that the ice products have other uses for various capital ships/fleets and the current method at least gives you options of using pos fuel if necessary which wont be the case after the change.further compounded by additional difficulty of groups working out of a pos where they would have to add a manufacturing step (min. 2 silos and a manufacturing array) at the pos (if they were sourcing ice locally) in order to convert fuel products for the pos.and if you were buying fuel products your now going to be paying an additional cost for what basically a plastic wrap process with a better name.basically i see this dev idea as un-necessary and shouldnt be supported.as for this thread, i would suggest that the op should have set it up a non support thread, similar to the nano-nerf threads next time if he wishes to discuss dev ideas."
"ccp isn't a bank."
"not supported. very very very bad idea."

"i also think that it's absolutely laughable that a company so dedicated to roleplaying aspects of a game gives set laws of physics, forces everyone to get used to them, and then decides that they just want to arbitrarily change the laws of physics as if god would change the laws of gravity to make the olympics more fair for fat people."
"i am voting against the nerf of speeds even though i was for a nerf of ludicrous speeds in the beginning. why? because ccp seems unable to fix a broken aspect of the game without breaking others in the process. nor do i like that they want to make the game easier for defenders and owners of space and drastically make \"guerrilla warfare\" less viable.nozh mentioned that the speed was fine in \"2004\" and that i believe is the problem. we have a dev with a \"2004\" mindset that want to drastically alter \"2008\".and that's my reason why i can't vote \"yes\".edit: forgot to klick the support-idea-thingy."

"the rorqual fits that bill aswell."
"because any activation of a non-governing faction cyno could bring in hostile cap ships as well as with a \"non-aggressive commercial ship\" with the factions at war any one of these so called commercial ships could be filled with explosives jumped behind enemy lines under false pretenses to ram itself into a station and blow it up.rp ftw."
"local is a ridiculous intel tool indeed. some sort of delay...like possibly 5 min (you wouldnt show up in local if you're less than 5 min in the system. it would work the other way too, so you wouldnt see anyone that had been in the system for a while until 5 min after you jump in) would be acceptable.i'd prefer to remove local completely though, and have the scanner modified so it would be more useful. possibly make the scanner autoupdate in a way, but only within normal scan range. that way as a gang you would be able to sneak through systems, without whatever random ratter there would relay intel to the rest of his alliance, making surprise attacks on enemy home systems possible if they dont have dedicated scouts out."

"upon entering a system with people in your fleet giving bonuses, any siege warfare bonuses that grant extra shields must be recharged. any armored warfare bonuses, however, are automatically applied without a need to repair or remote repair. for shield tankers jumping into engagements soon after receiving bonuses, this presents a problem where the bonuses can't be enjoyed.i suggest that shield bonuses be applied in the same manner that armor bonuses are. this is a significant disadvantage for people who rely primarily upon shield tanks without shield boosters or a remote rep nearby."
"i heartily agree."
"it would make more sense for the armor level to need repair than automatically fill the shields. goons"
"then there would be absolutely no reason to train for bonuses at all. no one's going to train for armor bonuses if it means you have to rep every single ship before an engagement."
"three counterpoints. firstly, this is the opposite of how every other shield hp addition works - be it onlining an extender, gaining a rank in shield management, or having a fleet booster leviathan enter local. secondly, armour hp buffs just add to hp, whereas shield hp buffs add to tank as well, due to passive regeneration being a time and not a rate. you get more benefit than an armour tanker does, you can suffer a drawback fairly. thirdly, if you care about hp, i should hope your gang booster has both armoured warfare and siege warfare trained, meaning that you get both effects and thus the difference between them is fairly narrow for most ships. besides, shields and armour are different. as long as it all evens out, and i think it does, i'm not going to fret too much."
"it doesn't even out. few ships fit armor reps or shield boosters in fleet pvp. most tanks are purely passive tanks. armor tanks are immediately granted a substantial buffer upon having bonuses applied, while shield bonuses have to recharge every time you change systems with your gang.if the shields had to charge up once after joining a gang, and then stayed charged as you moved from system to system, i wouldn't have a problem with that. but having to recharge them every time you jump through a gate with your gang is pretty ridiculous."
"this is a good idea. i am stupid and every time i get a shield bonus i think someone is shooting at me."
"yo sup joe dis a pretty neat thread u got goin' on up in here dogg but man i don't know about dis reppin **** dogg like it's my body i do what i want you know"
"joe your stupid. just get them to fill up the shields ( buff ) rather then nerf ( make armor work worse)"
"supported. it takes a really long time for them to regenerate too since the last bit of shields always recharge the slowest."
"it would be a nice bit of balance."
"supportedno reason in the world that shields shouldn't be filled up after bonuses are applied. doesn't matter if other modules don't work like that, this is a basic balance issue."
"you can't just balance things for fleet pvp though. people gang for small pvp and for missions/complexes, and you have to keep that in mind. admittedly, this isn't as relevant an issue for them as it is for fleets, but it does have to be kept in mind. that said, your point about switching systems is a good one. if you wanted to make a rule that bonuses linger for 30 seconds or a minute after somebody leaves system, so that they can meet up on the other side and not lose hp, i'd be in favour of that. but it shouldn't come in full every time."

"remove local, no free intel, the game is meant to be fun"
"not unless a better on-board scanner is put into place."
"i agree. having to scan every belt in every single system you roam through to find ratters would make this game more fun."
"i can see some changes to the game involving the removal of local that would be beneficial overall - a decent one was proposed a couple months back(the neural network thread). a naked removal, however, would be a horrible idea. don't eliminate it unless you replace it with a suite of other intel-gathering tools which are at least as powerful in the hands of a skilled player."
"replacing it with a better way to get intel than we have right now?(apart from local) yes. making it just as overly effective? no."
"that's been the general consensus for the past several years i've played eve... why the devs have completely ignored this aspect, i have no idea.(hey, bonus! a great way to discourage blob warfare is to make it harder to know the opponents exact numbers by simply popping a scout in local)"
"this is a god-awful idea. it doesn't surprise me that someone in a newb corp would suggest it. locating people in a system take long enough as it is, and demands good skills either with a directional scanner or good skills with probing. simply knowing that they're there is akin to a flight transponder or radar screen, it makes perfect sense, and allows people to know when to have fun and when to tred softly."
"this. actually finding a target takes long enough. i'm not in support of this unless whatever replaces it actually tells you someone's in there. i could live with it not telling you exactly who was in there and just listing the number of people in system. even with that it'd completely mess up empire wars. good luck sifting through 100+ ships to try and find out if a wartarger is in local or not. local would simply have to stay around in high-sec."

"i actually rather like this. low priority, but it'd be cool to see."
"i like this idea a lot. it provides another entry point for player-based game building while providing a non-mechanical way for people to feel the significant effect of their alliance achievements.i say proceed."
"this is a fantastic idea. almost like a player controlled concord billboard"
"system motd, yes, low-priority \"fluff\".pob (player owned billboard), hell no, especially for those who are evil enough to place it at the warp-in of the gate."
"this is an excellent idea."
"this is awesome, you are awesome."
"\"2) qued list of skills\"this is needed. logging in change skill, log-off does sod all for game play. i hate corp mates joining for all of 4 seconds. it does not add to game play or participation at all ccp."
"support for this idea"
"what exactly is the csm saying \"remove lag plz\" going to accomplish? ccp is well aware of the lag issues, and those lag issues are an inevitable consequence of trying to have 500+ people involved in a battle. this isn't some simple issue of turning the lag switch off where all the csm needs to do is ask for it. no amount of whining is going to make the hardware issues go away, and even if/when ccp manages to find a solution to the current lag, players will simply start bringing bigger and bigger blobs until they hit the new server limit.as for useful or not, the real test will be the nano nerf. if the csm gets an alternate idea for the final nerf, it will have done its job. if ccp just ignores their advice (as i suspect they will), it will be painfully obvious that it's nothing more than a publicity stunt."
"the amount of whine is too much to go with my cheese in this thread, tbh.the csm, whilst having flaws in its first ever run, did its job, and that is bringing issues in front of ccp that matter to players, instead of them having to sift through tons of crap whine posts like this to get to actual, good info they could use.does it mean i like the csm now? not really.oh, so that means i dont like the idea of the csm and that it should just be thrown away since its useless. no either.the csm is a far better option than having ccp getting the wrong idea from the stupid amounts of noise and whines on the forum."
"i already see a massive response to the second csm. maybe we'll get actually 400 people to vote."
"patience, grasshopper. i don't think ccp has approved the candidacies yet - when that happens i would expect to see a lot more campaigns begun in earnest..."
"of course, a month later, clinton and obama had both launched. it's a rule of elections - the no-names launch first, because they need to make a splash to stand out from the crowd, because they're hoping to use the extra weeks or months to build momentum, or because they don't understand how easy it is to be forgotten when you're talking before anybody is listening. look again in a week or two and tell me that there's no response."
"the problem with the csm as i see it. isn't that it hasn't done anything.but that it hasn't been seen to have done anything.ccp has not given it a chance to validate itself.and as such needs to do something visual, for the rank and file."
"amen. i've trained through all the learning skills nearly three times now. at best (having basic implants right away, well-spread stats) it's 45 days of wasted game time. at worst it's the #1 reason why people burn out and there are so few that make it past the 1 year mark. i used to be of the opinion that they were a choice, didn't need them, and they should remain. i've since grown up from such childish non-thinking. ultimately there are two things to consider for an mmo: growth and retention. learning skills run counter to both.here's my solution: ccp should sell characters that come with all of the basic learning skills at lvl5 and the advanced learning skills at lvl4 for $30-$50 (the cost of the 1.5 wasted months of game time + additional markup price gouging). now instead of blowing cash on power of 2 and grinding *two* characters through 2 months of wasted time, they can spend it on one character and start playing instantly. they also are not advantaged over people who actually took the 3 months to train the advanced skills to lvl5. i know this is unfair to people who have low incomes, but it's the best crackpot solution i can invent given my knowledge of mmo bottom lines and the absolutely terrible game-killing solutions that actually get adopted (nerf nerf nerf! hahaha! it's all fixed now!).i can tell you that ccp is not going to remove their precious money sink skills, though. they're so damn scared of modifying their skill tree (bonuses notwithstanding) that it's become the disorganized mess we know and love (hate?) today."
"eve is all about mining veldspar for 6 months, griefing veldspar miners for another 6, and then blobbing from then on.and growth and retention are the key elements to the mmo business. or did you forget that ccp is trying to make a living off you? it's in their interests to increase both.edit: and the only thing complicated about eve is fitting your ship. once you've got that figured out (a total of 1 week learning right there, tops), you warp in, hit your win button, warp out. repeat as necessary, replace ships as required."
"if you're needing to replace ships at all then you badly need a better 'win button'. either that or it's not quite as straightforward as you make out...i'm mostly looking forward to the next csm elections so this post can finally die the death it deserves. only posting in it again now because it's already at the top of the forum so i'm not bumping it"
"you eventually need to crawl out of the ibis, (or, if you're the 50% that didn't roll caldari like the rest of us, one of the other three ships). from there you will probably want to get something larger than a frigate, unless you love frigates.then there's also the portion of people that pvp in this game. i know it's shocking, but apparently people do it. unless that pvp is waged only against people hopelessly outclassed and outnumbered, you're eventually going to lose a ship. of course, we could all gather 'round the largest veldspar we can find in our hulks and sing kumbaya.and i was unaware the sole purpose of the csm was censorship of unpatriotic thinking. sounds a bit communist to me. can i be a bluecap? i'd much enjoy going around throwing posters into gulags."
"im running for csm. i'm a long time eve player focusing and primarily experienced within the null sec life sphere.i have done pretty much everything within this game at one point or another, from mine to mission to run a reaction chain.i consider myself to be an honorable player and i value above almost all else things like intergrity and trust.i know this game and i love this game. so,ask away with you questions on all my various belief's and see if i'm your man"
"why did you join razor?"
"eve mail him and stop derailing this thread vily is a good man and will do great as a csm. massive respect vily o7"
"it's a good question, it establishes the type of player he is."
"i assume you're joking, but in case you're not, q+a was the primary purpose of these threads in the last election - it isn't just a campaign platform, it's also a town hall meeting. it's far better this way than starting a \"why did you join razor\" thread separately - which, if you wanted it answered publicly, would be necessary."
"i didn't ask him to start a new thread. i don't understand what a town hall meeting is on a forum, can you explain it to me please? (sorry i am new to computers and forums)."
"\"town hall meeting\" is a political term, not a forum term. the idea being a spot where the candidate goes to a \"town hall\" and gets asked large numbers of question by ordinary people, instead of a more conventional interview or debate where all the questions come from one person. what i meant by it was that this is a forum thread accessible by anybody, and as such it's a spot where people go to ask direct questions of the candidate. questions for all candidates tend to be asked in separate threads, but if i wanted to ask specifically vily something(as the above poster did), then i'd ask it here. and you're right in that the question could be asked by evemail, but if the questioner wanted to ask the question publicly, it'd basically have to be done on the forums. also, the text length limits on evemail is even more punishing than it is on the forums, so if the answer was long it'd require several mails. as such, for most questions of a candidate, the right place to ask them is on the candidate's thread - i.e., right here."
"a multitude of reasons. rzr is a well organized and stable entity, within which i know the leadership and have a good base of freind's. i wanted to get involved in the conflict up north and i like the underdog. i like places where i can help and make a difference.i also enjoy capital warfare (theoretically) and to do so a large style alliance like razor usually provides good opportunities for that."
"thank you for the frank answer to my question. it seems these days people like to \"troll\" geniune questions on forums and your attitude is refreshing to say the least.i never lived in a town so i guess the term went over my head. i do however see how it works now, thanks to your insight. with this in mind, i would like to ask vily this; do you believe that ccp should add more lvl 4 missions in high sec to alleviate lag in mission hubs?"
"if been a member of the csm and been a member of a corp or alliance, conflicted with each other.would you give up said alliance/corp."
"what kind of stuipid question is this, i mean there are goon csm members, geese get a grip on reality"
"it's a question of commitmant to the csm.which in their minds is the most important.corp, alliance, or the csm"
"a good question, and one every candidate should be askedbefore i vote for someone, i want to know who they represent me or their corporation and alliance."

"actually, why don't you just have a pos module that locks the jumpgates to any hostiles if you control the system? or the ability to use the carebear billions to contract concord to patrol your sov space?"
"how about a system-wide doomsday pos module.. that only affects hostiles?"
"um going to vote no! however if there was a way to make destroyers have a cloaked ship sonar sytem id be all forit. system wide? going with no no and hellno! i say this as a sb pilot mind you."
"i've seen 4 \"power of 2\" promo's in my time in eve.the first 3, of course, werent in \"dire global financial restraints\".still hasnt changed why i would not spend more than 1 account's worth on the game, not counting my reasons for doing so either."
"this csm will be just as fubar as the last one.because the big alliance's, have to much influence.every idea, is viewed towards maintaining the status quo.new player corp's and single account players are strangled, which is why so many fail or leave the game.this as got to be the hardest game to get a start in, unless you have a mentor and or previous experience.the role of the csm should be to promote the game, not private or corp/alliance agenders"

"locked.non-constructive."
"not every alliance with sov 3/4 in their space have the numbers at other peak times to fight off, say, a 20man camping of one's station or attack on a pos when no one's online.example: a us/uk based alliance losing a pos to an aus/nz/asian based group and losing just because they have to force themselves to stay up/wake up early to fight them off. many would rather just not play in this case, which means less revenue for ccp, and we all know how they can react when it means they're losing money.not every alliance with any sov for that matter have 24/7 slaves attached to their eve clients staying on station to provide security.some people have lives beyond eve."
"can't think why irc would be interested in this sort of thing....."
"is there a small gang giving irc some trouble or something?"
"could be, could be."
"i think this was on the drawing board at some point, but since jump bridges put an end to 90% of gate travel then they werent really needed."
"i for one support this statement."
"i'll take this as a compliment."
"no to gate guns - but i do like the idea of being able to place a couple around an outpost - controlled from within by a gunner"
"i do imagine that part of the responsibility of holding space in 0.0 was having to actually defend it; made oh so much easier by the tools you already have (hello system scanners and jump bridges)"
"to be honest, you should be able to defend your space without logging in for months and not having to sacrifice ships to the enemy."
"there's an idea i could go for, risking taking considerable heat and radiation damage, sensor scrambling em waves and potentially getting caught with your pants down in a desperate attempt to get a little fuel from the sun to make the next jump. could consider it part of the tactical environment idea. but i actually like that idea"
"i gotta find a tactical environment thread, i'm really starting to like that idea"
"nice stuff! love it.this isn't just for capitals, but for black ops ships as well. if anything black ops vessels would profit more from it - a boost they could use."
"as dark said above me, its already hardly even profitable (read not at all) by comparison to mine ice instead of regular ores... the last thing we need is a system where people can get fuel without even mining ice."
"the idea was that you'd be too far away from your mining vessel to mine ice for fuel, or anywhere near a station to buy it! black ops definately, tactical refuelling etc i like...keep the ideas coming...arithron"
"so whats to stop people from doing this in their personally controlled low/null secs.. or even in high sec.. why mine ice when i can probably scoop the fuel i need 10x faster than mining ice.. which causes the problem.. it would have to take atleast double the time to get the fuel from a scoop than it would from mining it."
"it just needs to have a massive downside to it, like really, really large bursts of thermal/em damage (i guess relative to ship size, otherwise blast big enough to hurt carrier would pop a black op) and minimal returns in fuel. make it so if a carrier/mom/whatever is caught harvesting from the sun its at a huge tactical disadvantage and can be easily destroyed. that way the primary source of fuel will still be ice, but if your a long way from home and short on fuel, that sun might look worth the risk.after a little more thought, best way to do it would probably be a high slot module. long cycle time that prevents warp, stops shield and capacitor from recharging, makes ship unable to receive logistic support or something like that."
"you could make it require modules, which use up slots that can't be used for something else. could be enough of a downside when you need to add a highslot harvester and a medslot on-board refinery to your ship. in addition to it being less efficient than ice mining, of course."
"he he he... i figured, at least answer me this: was the \"dead horse\" discussed? if it was discussed, we will hear, at some point, what the deal is. that is all i want to know at this moment."
"i can't wait for a response to this either, hope its good news, would hate to see we lobbied for this for 2 years just to see it all go down the drain."
"it wasn't discussed directly due to ccp's initial response. however, it was refered to quite a few times in discussion about other mechanics."
"this is a really good idea and really something that \"feels\" like eve. :)"
"well looking at ccps obsession with ambulation, which is a completely unneeded feature from game perspetive and totaly ignoring this issue for well over a year, i am not very optimistic.seems to me that this horse will wither to dust before ccp even acknowledges the idea ..."
"what? you kidding me? why were we not told the ccp response? what happened, are we getting screwed again by ccp? why did not csm notify us as to the content of ccp's response? isn't csm duty to the players of this game, and oversight the ccp's actions and to bring suggestions? you need to lay it all out for us, there has been to many half-words, and double takes with regards to pos/dead horse/ccp/csm - this is the only issue i have seen thus far thoroughly ignored or avoided by ccp."
"no kidding, that's a crock of crap. wasn't directly discussed, that's useful, and what pray tell was this referred to from, new sov system? research? that's a crap answer. ccp is going to have a lot of mad pos's runners if this doesn't go through, or they don't explain why it's not going to happen, assuming its not."
"i say first major engagement."
"don't worry, ccp will fix it!"
"unfortunately you know you will be called primary, right? p.s. please ccp save yorda!"
"i do seem to get primaried a lot, but any decent fc wont primary a nag in a cap fight. lowest dps, high burst tank (it only lasts for 1-2minutes but that's about as long as most dreads last in a cap fight anyway), plus they're like a giant marker of where the enemy cap fleet is.pos shots on the other hand..."
"i do not see how the ability to train skill during account inactivity is a so called advantage. i strongly incourage a rethinking of this idea."
"it's not advantageous to train a 30+ day skill without having to pay for the game?skill training is part of the game. to play the game, you pay. to train skills, you pay."
"good change, pay if you want to train your skills. use your alt in a blackbird till you got him trained up for falcon"
"**** ccp, if they take this feature out i'm not playing this game anymore"
"thank you ccp."
"removing ghost training is a good thing.people pay to play, why should people be rewarded for not paying? it makes no sense.the change is good in my opinion."
"this change will lose ccp some of my money. ghost training isn't something i and most others do instead of playing, it's something we did as well as playing.the exception is people who have to be away from eve for a while. that consoling phrase \"oh well... at least you can set a long skill mate\" will no longer be there to encourage them to return.they can have my cash for 2 accounts or the can have my cash for 2 accounts + 2 ghost training accounts = about 50% more. their choice, really.edit: as for the mythical and never proven \"character farming\" - what the eff? they just spent a year giving isk farmers every possible buff and protection, now we're supposed to think they care so much about character farming?"
"just because it's refreshing to come back into the game with a nice new skill when you've taken a break for a couple months."
"its ok ccp, make sure that people who quit the game stay quit :)"
"i'm sure they'll get right on reversing the changes due to this thread."
"well.. just for the record. for the good it does."
"i will no renew my subscription to my third account if this goes through."
"but but but, the csm isnt just a powerless circlejerk right? right!?!?!"
"i can clearly see why its a serious advantage of training up your char while not paying for your account.heck i'd call it an exploit.ccp loses money over such things.... because your ganking them out of there hard earned money in supporting this game.that's like saying i'll train _____ level v which takes over 30 days and not pay for one month of eve online.and then come back and reactivate the account and start paying for it but they dont get the one month back.that's cheating the system.convenient or not.... i support ccp in there decision.if your not going to pay for your account... there should be a count down timer then everything on your account should just flat freeze. (glorified pause button)when re-activated the account should pick up where it left off.as for the timer? 48 hours or something... not too long to make it abuse-able... but long enough for someone to figure out where to get the cash to pay for it again.sorry folks... but putting a stop to an exploitable feature is something i want to see.people who pay for this game pay to play it and train there char's on it.if your not going to play the game just to train up your char... you shouldn't be able to train up your char by not playing the game for extended periods of time./me emphatic thumbs down"
"4 days left until account canceled still left 33 days skill training"
"corrected that for you.i see nothing wrong with this change. why should people who aren't playing the game benefit equally to those who actually pay to play? makes sense that if an account goes inactive, training should too."
"its just a suggestion, but i would love for them to re do allot of the sound effects ect, make them more movie like and a little less pac man.you know, stuff like new gate jump noises and new laser noises, a nice bass tone while your ships in space would be cool also.cheers"
"the game could definitely use some audio polish. graphics have been improved a lot. sound fell short, so far."
"i vote no.i'd be fine with the suggestion to make mwds turn off other modules like cloaks do, as long as abs got a buff to help.no ship should ever be invulnerable, but the nerf as described is doing it wrong."
"your market orders and research points should stop if the account is inactive. after all, with market orders up you can make money while your account is expired. with research points you can continue to accumulate them while your account is expired, and when you re-subscribe you come back to a fat amount of rps that you can cash in for isk. that is entirely inconsistent with the ghost training thing.if ccp wants to remove ghost training then they should also remove market orders from inactive accounts, and stop inactive accounts from acquiring rps.dividend payouts to inactive shareholders as well, those should be stopped. capsuleers who actively put their time and energy into working on their characters should reap the benefits of the game, not inactive ones. timexenergy=profit! not timexinactive=profit!"
"supporting my idea."
"because it makes sense."
"this game isn't fun to play anyway we might as well make it worse rite :ccp:"
"if skill training suspension for inactive accounts is logical, there's no reason why this shouldn't be also.edit:agreein' wit dis"
"if ccp removes ghost training they should do this as well."
"might as well be fair and run this **** into the ground across the board!"
"this is logical. to some extent, more logical than removing 'ghost training,' which serves as a carrot to entice people to come back to the game if they have to leave for a while.i don't know about market orders, though -- i'm not a programer, but it seems like it might be hard to do it in any way other than cancelling all orders, and if your account lapses for even a day . . . well, yeah."
"also, character inactive for longer than a certain time period (to be determined by devs, of course) should be deleted. they're getting to use db slots for free to the detriment of people paying for the game."
"signed in support."
"buttess"
"qft"
"well if ccp is going to move with the ghost training this only seems logical. supported..."
"yes. if you're going to do something, then you need to be consistent."
"not much else to say. the value of rp items have gone drastically down with all these old unsubscribed accounts pulling them in. a player just has to reactivate the account and has access to upwards of years worth of rp. that kind of passive unsubscribed income must not be allowed."
"support"
"supportedmaybe allow a few days for forgetfulness then make all characters on unsubbed accounts completely inactive.no rp gainedsuspend market ordersno bpo researchno production"
"supporting goon trolls"
"throw in a small meager timer for those who don't have money right now but can get it in 48 hours ish and you got my vote."
"proposal makes sense. on the other hand, you left out outstanding contracts. presumably they should be cancelled as well. if ccp want all or nothing, than all or nothing it should be. supported."
"or you could send the money to the scc or some such black hole which would make a great isk sink hole. ^_^"
"lrtsitg"
"short term, yes. first 30 minutes, the lag will be worse. look at a current double dd'ng, which is as close a simulation, to my proposal as anything, only difference is that with double dd'ng, the second dd does full damage, while in my proposal the \"second wave\" of the titan, would only do enough damage to remove wrecks/pods. but most fights were titans are lagbreaking fights/nodecrashing fights, i.e. fights that take hours upon hours, a good \"second wave\" dd can then be beneficial for the longterm of the fight.i agree. thats why, i proposed this idea, to make doomsday only interesting to combat the lag and to remove all other benefits from doomsday'ng. (i.e. the loot)or otherwise told. current situation2 fleets, a lesser skilled pvp fleet with 160 peeps but with a titan in system, a skilled pvp fleet with 80 peeps but without titan in system. 80 battleships in the lesser skilled pvp fleet, vs 40 battleships in the skilled pvp fleet.the 2 fleets go head to head.after 10 minutes in the battle, the skilled pvp fleet are making headway in killing more hostiles then loosing friendlies, 20 battleships of the \"lesser killed pvp fleet\" are killed for 10 battleships of the \"skilled pvp fleet\" , however far from being able to tell that the \"less skilled fleet will loose the battle\".however the titan pilot of the lesser skilled pvp fleet , doesnt want to take the risk, that they will loose the battle, and orders the friendly fleet to warp out so that he can warp in and dd' the hostile fleet. the hostile fleet looses the majority of its ships and the battle is over. the lesser skilled pvp fleet warps back in and loots the field. my scenario2 fleets, a lesser skilled pvp fleet with 160 peeps but with a titan in system, a skilled pvp fleet with 80 peeps but without titan in system. 80 battleships in the lesser skilled pvp fleet, vs 40 battleships in the skilled pvp fleet.the 2 fleets go head to head.after 10 minutes in the battle, the skilled pvp fleet are making headway in killing more hostiles then loosing friendlies, 20 battleships of the \"lesser killed pvp fleet\" are killed for 10 battleships of the \"skilled pvp fleet\" , however far from being able to tell that the \"less skilled fleet will loose the battle\".now the lesser skilled pvp fleet titan pilot, has to weigh the risks, if he warps now in, not only does he risk his titan, but also he will remove all the loot from the field, so instead he chooses to wait, battle rages on, 30 minutes in the fight, 40 \"lesser skilled pvp fleet\" battleships are lost, but also 18 \"skilled pvp battleships\" are lost.the lesser skilled pvp fleet sees now even less reason to dd the field, if the \"skilled pvp fleet\" keeps loosing its own battleships at this rate, they eventually have to retreat, as they will not have enough firepower left to kill fast enough the \"less skilled pvp fleets\" battleships. and indeed this happens 50 minutes in the battle, 60 battleships of the \"lesser skilled pvp fleet\" are killed but almost all of the 40 battleships of the \"skilled pvp fleet\" are killed. the \"skilled pvp fleet\" has to retreat.the \"lesser skilled pvp fleet\" holds the field and loots the proceedings. no titan needed to be used.in summary. with my idea, the titan pilot will only warp in when the fight, definitely looks lost, from his side, instead of always warping in..."
"i like the idea, but in my opinion the titan should be able to roast pods and wrecks as well as the ships they came from in a single blast.if you can survive the dd then thats great, warp away to rep or join your fleet, but if you pop it should destroy your ship and wreck, regardless, but any excess damage left over from your ship should be applied to your pod and you may or may not survive that."
"ccp has already said they are looking at titans doomsdays in general. to the effect of changing them. i don't support this for the reason that it would elimate any money you could make by salvaging or looting the wreck.no, i'm not an appleboy alt."
"much to my dismay ccp has decided to move on this issue without the csm delegates debating the value of eliminating ghost training but leaving all other ghost activities in. (rp farming & market orders)i would have preferred smaller steps eliminating some of the absentee resource gains other than skill training. (again, i don't ghost train.) i would have also liked to see some sort of guidelines to cover the occasional billing problem here and there that does, often enough, crop up.sad that ccp will latch onto an idea from the players but will not discuss the idea they co-opt with their customers. in fact, i think ccp has forgotten that in the end they are a service provider and we are the customers. rile us at risk to your business... in an already risky economy for you."
"agree,there is no good reason to allow unpaid accounts to gain skills."
"yes. if you're going to do something, you need to be consistent with it."
"i like it. i can already think of lots of ways to use it offensively and defensively."
"i like this one ... but 14 days is a lot imo .. 7-10 is enough.the general concept is ok, but it needs some tweaking still (like better scanning options to start with)."
"sounds interesting."
"sounds interesting"

"lets say corp 1 wardecs corp 2. they pay like 2 million and thats it? 2million is nothing.my corp has 5 standing with concord. we are bestest friends. but it only takes 2 million to make them turn on me? even when i more or less keep my nose clean. no piracy, no resource stealing, no anything. i dont bother anyone.if concord can be bribed by people who concord hates for a measly 2million... my being best friends with concord should mean i could pay 2million per week to concord to be perfectly immune to war decs. but that doesnt make sense.if concord is so corrupt... they honestly should auction the wardec off to the highest bidder. if i'm such a pain my enemy should be willing to pay 500million per week? if thats what i will pay?the auction can literally work the same way as normal auctions do. 10% increase per bid. this will give true value to how much corp/alliance 1 will pay to wardec the bad person; or at least in turn causing the enemy to lose funds to concord for continued safety."
"do you mean an alliance that simply can not claim sov? interesting idea.i think for us it would be an issue, if we ever want to hurt cva's position in providence then we have to be able to break their sov. that means sov challenging towers.i guess a work around is forming a second 'alt' alliance that runs the towers while the ushra'khan becomes this new non-sov alliance but it would need thinking about. pos gunners would either be alts or mains moved out the ushra'khan to the other alliance, which would be a similar issue to the one we currently have with fw - fracturing of the community.it's an interesting idea but would need careful consideration."
"supported"
"i've always liked this idea. give us a chance to actually catch cloaking isk farmers. the constellation chat would replace local for intel... could be very interesting."
"another option would be to make the normal scanner systemwide, and autoupdate with a certain interval (to remove the need to spam the scan button every 5 sec).the downside of the systemwide scanner would be that it gets more inaccurate the further away you are from the object. for example 50% chance to get wrong results at 20 au."
"this new 0.0 region(or 2) will be home to a new npc race.this new race will be natural descendants in new-eden. they evolved in this space; they have very strong ships but no capital ships. why?this region will be unique in that due to physics and proximity to the inner gobular cluster creating cynos will be impossible; because of this they developed no capital ships and instead have slightly more advanced ships. many of the designs very similar to rogue drones.this race will have faction ships such as a rogue drones dominix.this race is faction neutral and due to only recently discovering they arent the only ones in new-eden. they dont trust anyone. they hold no stance towards pirates or empires. they also dont sell bpos for their ships. these faction ships are only available at lp cost.the rats are obviously rogue drones; they may drop faction bpcs just as you might find a nightmare bpc; the exploration complexes only obviously.what makes this fun is that it will be 0.0 fun without any capital ships."
"against. no aliens. ever. one good thing about eve is no aliens.eve is all about humanity. about our nature, our expansion, our greed, our passion."
"i never understand that kind of mentality or rationality on the \"aliens will ruin eve\" type atitude.nevermind the whole damn game is science fiction to begin with.it just sounds..... stupid.sorry... but i keep trying to figure out as to the justification of that kind of mentality.after all... the galaxy was not inhabited by humans to begin with... in reality we are the aliens there.anyway... to be constructive... if there's going to be a new ncpc race... use one that already exists...rogue drones."
"was there a prayer of this making it out in the december industrial patch?"
"-tier 3 transport? would be ideal i think. currently there's like no reason to train transport above 1.-no cloak option so it isnt used to get through blockade of any kind.-use of cans would be reasonable.-tractor beam single would be best."
"ok so we have something on the overview that now shows you who is scramming/webing/dampening etc you, why not have something for miners that shows which roid is already being mined? you could even go further and show which one is being mined by your group and which one is being mined by somebody outside your group. i'm sure it would be easy to code and would be a great help to all things mined.edit: \"i'm not sure what more to add. on the overview there should be a little icon next to every roid, just like the icons that tell you who is warp scrambling you etc. this icon will serve to show you if a roid is already being mined by somebody else, that is it's only purpose. maybe it could even tell you who exactly is mining it in the tool tip when you mouse over it. the icon could also be multi-colored, white for neutral, green for corp members and purple for fleet members.this helps in just that situation that you mentioned, when you have a ton of people mining the same belt so they aren't \"mining over\" each other. mining the same roid is counter productive because if 2 people are mining the same roid and one person kills it before the other one whoever's mining lasers finish first gets all the ore, and the other person doesn't get anything. at present the only way to counter this is to carefully select roids in space that don't have a laser on them (which is tedious and also can throw you out of alignment if you're clicking on a roid too fast and start to move toward it instead of selecting it), or to just randomly pick roids on the overview and hope you don't overlap other people.this is an easy solution to the problem and a sure fire way to keep people from mining the same roid.\""
"i can see where your going with this... but your idea needs refinement.what happens if you end up in a area with a ton of miners chewing away?refine it a bit for and you just might get some support.^_^pardon the puns..."
"mega carebear reporting in. frankly there's no new content like missions that really make a difference. you could create 5000 new missions, 1000 lvl 4s and we will eventually memorize and know which missions we hate and refuse to do and which missions are good and the best ways of doing them.industry sort of is very dependent on pvp factor as it's the pvp guys who destroy and use ships. rogue drone dominix would be great. something to really compete with the golem. the minifreighter is happening. most likely a method of moving rigged ships en masse is likely in the works also."
"for some of us that have a hard time getting an issue they order in the mail, maybe ccp can put the eon magazine up for digital download as a .pdf file like alot of rpg companies are doing (ie. drivethrurpg.com). on a more personal note, i'm currently deployed to iraq (and can, even if barely, play), and the last issue i ordered didn't get to me for almost 3 months. that's about the time i was getting ready to order the next issue. a digital download version of the magazine, i can keep up with current events in the eve universe rather than read up on \"future\" updates that already have been implemented by the time i get the magazine. and if it catches on, just think of how much money would be saved due to printing costs .if illegal downloading is a concern, you could (like drivethrurpg.com) keep tabs on floating copies by use of secure watermarks, ie. customer name and tracking number.yes i keep referencing another site, but i believe it's good to have done my homework."
"(i searched but did not find anything regarding the subject.)i have played over a year and have multiple account, which i have no intention of changing. however, i found out long ago that \"alts\" are near useless since only one character at a time can train.i understand the reason behind this as a result of how offline training works and if everyone could have a three characters per account getting full offline training at the same time, well, everyone would have three characters per account, just cause. (ok, plus it makes good business to get more players to play multiple accounts instead of multiple chars.)i already know why it would not be fair to veteran players to now implement standard alternate character training and why a company would not want to do it from a financial standpoint.my idea is simple and it makes the idea of playing alts more appealing, even for those of us with multiple accounts.ok, to the point...in it's crude form, if there were sliders on the character select screen that allowed one to select how much of the present 100% training is desired for any character(s).one could take the default as is now and give one character 100%.one could give a main 75% of the training while trying a new race and/or career combo on an alt with 25% training, or 50/50.one could have a main running at 50% with two alternate characters at 25%.there are plenty of examples but i am sure all reading this get the idea.for those that care nothing for alts, then keep the default 100% that you enjoy now. for those of us that prefer to mix up our play styles, roleplaying or immersion as times, there is a slight training penalty when using multiple character, but not the all or nothing penalty that currently exists.thanks for your time, now go explore the stars. the universe awaits!"
"actually i think this idea was \"implied\" but not clearly stated.i think that would work.... it gives a balanced penalty for such an advantage... and it woudln't unbalance everything.... the only drawback of course.. is it takes longer to learn.but at least your alt doesn't become a \"toon\".i'm gonna wait for feedback before i give support."
"exactly...as it stands now, one \"toon\" gets no learning, compared to only taking longer to learn. to avoid the penalty, one can keep the default, as is now, with 1 char always getting 100%. either way, it's balanced as we are still talking about the same amount of skill gain now for each account. just give the player a choice as how to divvy up that skill gain.edit - oooops, this is still ledoro, just didn't change my \"toon\" before replying...."
"hey, let's get rid of 12 years of school and give everyone diplomas..seriously tho, if you think learning skills are hindering you from playing eve, you're obviously not playing it right. anyone who has a new character and knows exactly what they want is definitely not a newb.while learning the learning skills, a newb can learn build on the skills he/she learned from the tutorial, while building up a path to get future skills faster. think about it, what does a brand new character need before anything else? isk.whenever i recruit new players to the game, i tell them to learn the learning skills first and foremost while they mine roids to gain money before they decide exactly what they want their character be. that's what i believe the learning skills are there for. to give the character time to decide before they dump their hard earned isk into random skills that won't benefit them."
"i think the use of sensors, or the evaluation of actual sensor data is almost non existant in eve and if it was, it could improve gameplay, immersion and tactical options.what i would like to see is a basic representation of the sensor systems a ship has, beyond what the onboard scanner can do already. the funny thing is, that it is so immensely powerful, that it can pick up and pinpoint anomalies as far as 5 au and scan half a solar system via directional scan, yet it completely fails to deliver things much more simple.what i am talking about is ship data. not like the ship scanner, which gives detailed data on fitted modules. what i mean is the technically obvious stuff.massinertiapowergridcpu outputshield strengthmax capacitorsensor strengthmass should be obvious for ship scanners and even a few minutes of flight observation will give good data on the ship's agility. since the shields are projected from the ship and have strong interaction with almost everything, they should not be hard to evaluate either. powergrid, cpu and capacitor maximum could likely be evaluated from the ship's electromagnetic signature.my concept is that you lock a ship, open the onboard scanner, select a specific option (e.g. target profiling) and wait. the better you are with survey, the faster it goes and if you got a real ship scanner installed you'd get a massive bonus to both time and lod. after the scan is done you get results just like with normal scanning, where you get a list of target capabilities as listed above. not 100% precise and always with a small margin of error, but close enough to use it as tactical data.the great tactical option in this would be, that you could actually learn something about your enemy. not about the class of ship he flies. that is obvious to the naked eye. but every enemy is unique, each ship influenced by a unique set of skills. these skills impact ship characteristics, so it should be possible to get a basic evaluation of them. players can interpret the data any way they want to get intel either on the target in front of them, or on the pilot inside of it. tactical and strategic data beyond name, race and ship class. since only data that can reasonably be picked up by basic starship sensors is reflected, only a fraction of a character's abilities can be evaluated from his ship's stats and only a fraction of his ship's capacity and potential is visible.it would also add more usefulness to the basic scan and survey skills, beyond level 3 to learn salvage.it would allow players to conduct actual intel gathering operations, infiltrating enemy territory to gather data on their ships and pilots. such data, properly evaluated and analyzed, is worth money and i know quite some people who would pay for some profiling on their enemies. since the player only gets some raw data that includes a margin of error, it is the players brains and creativity that make something of that data. notice i did not include armor strength in my list of suggestions. armor is not easily visible, and likely hard to scan out. it can be derived by an experienced player, based on the ship's mass, though.it would be possible to identify the tank in an enemy formation, based on actual sensor intel, given the intel player knows what he is doing, instead of shooting the ship to find out. it would add some more subtlety, yet more depth to the game experience."
"do you mean to imply that this scanning would happen at long(measured in au) distances, or would it be an on-grid thing? if it's the former, this could be a very good addition to the pile of intel-gathering methods intended to replace local, and if it's the latter i doubt it will have any real use at all - if they're on grid, you should be shooting, not scanning."
"actually, both would be an option and being on grid also doesn't have to include shooting.range could be included as a factor that affects the margin of error, so that players could snoop out targets from a distance with lower result quality, while get better results when close up.being within vision range of the target also doesn't have to result in hostilities. after all, such intel gathering would work both at peace and at war, in 0.0 and in empire, between friend and foe.the onboard ship scanner works while cloaked. this could be the same case for this application. cloaking could influence result's margin of error, too.actually, the more options there are that allow intel gathering, the better. the more choices players can make to get fast & safe or slow & precise information, the better. i think the whole intel issue is incredibly important, because it gives options to those that want to play the mm part of the game, instead of just the o part."
"just an idea for those of us that use two monitors in eve. if it would be possible just to make the control area, i.e. the part where you choose the speed of your ship and all that stuff moveable. i don't see how that could be all that hard of a change but then we could move it from the middle off to the side or something.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.linkythat thing if i still wasn't clear enough."
"possible mechanic:each ship hit by a bomb explosion releases a secondary explosion, proportional to ship size. thus, lots of small ships would release lots of small explosions that probably don't reach their gang members, while lots of large ships would release lots of large explosions that probably do reach their gang members. thus, failure to spread out = death. blobs can be killed, small gangs are pretty much unaffected. large fleets are still viable, but need to spread out to survive. sbs gain a purpose in fleet warfare.disadvantage: probably harder to compute. secondary explosions should probably be instant, and non-visible. could be used to kill pos, so should not do damage to static installations. could be exploited via making a fleet with a ton of alts, blowing a bomb and stacking the explosions. somewhat unlikely though, since alts would need larger ships to make reasonable explosion sizes. thus, newly-created rookie-ship alt fleets would add essentially no damage.second possible mechanic:mines. mines are launched. mines sit in place. the longer the mine sits, the higher the damage. mines are triggered when the duration runs out or the sb pilot launches a trigger. thus, mines are a \"get away from that\" object. you see the mine, you run in the opposite direction or die. should be reasonably cheap and easy to get away from the explosion, but devastating to be caught when the timer is up. timer should be 30s-1min or so. breaks blobs with the \"run away\" factor. gives sb pilot a tactical decision: blow the bomb or make the fleet get further away from it?disadvantage: not as good as solution 1, but easier to compute. should not do damage to static installations."

"hasn't this been proposed before?my arguments against it are in another thread.ab"
"create a npc backbone to fluctuate and grow as normal. perhaps with ccp able to tweak according to storyline?the market history for example can show the history of the stock prices, and other details for the stocks.some newb with an obelisk shifting around t2 mods and such creating profit can put himself on the stock market. perhaps there's some super rich people who could drop 100mil on this stock at high risk. the guy turns out to be legit... your money in dividends returns. advertise and tell your friends... show them the history. they drop 100mil also. now this obelisk guy has a couple billion to use. which he puts to good use. eventually that person builds credit for himself.in real life people spend money on penny stocks all the time for the risk... they might drop some on microsoft also.risk vs reward. i know ricdic(if he's still around) and others have billions and billions and could hear of an obelisk trader. not care about 100mil and go for it.not only that....ccp themselves can develop indexes of their own. the ccp industrial index could be mixed around putting isk on the long term solid people who are established already with rep; they could throw npc corps in the mix; and also be kind enough to throw scrap money off to higher risk people in the attempt to create the ability for legit people to get started.not to mention... traders can start from scratch... buy their own stock and such and show good rep.yes creating the stock market or at least establish a new part of the normal market for stocks. would be quite the undertaking... but i think it certainly isnt just for a few.not to mention it isnt just for industrial people. goonfleet corp could put up stocks and their stocks could fluctuate based on how well they are doing. if they take heavy losses and have to pay for ships... their stock drops. etc etc."

"also please use more ice harvested fuel and less npc bought fuel."
"k, ill bite and ask a few questions then1. you view on local? should it stay or should it go?2. what do you feel about the current way pos wars work?3. you opinion on the nano changes?4. do you feel that the game mechanics are to much in favour of the defending party?"
"you have my vote :)"
"i haven't seen a situation where this would apply but in such case i would yes be forced to drop either my corp/alliance or csm.i have made similar decisions before, once with a character i was using to help friends, all of a sudden being in an alliance which we were planning hostilities against. i, despite wanting to help my friends, resigned that character from the alliance so as not to have conflicting interests"
"1. local has to stay sadly unless you are willing to accept a gigantic game shift. i will never forget after a patch a year or two ago local was gone. pirates and 0.0 players were having a feild day, but it was only enjoyable because we knew it was temporary. local represents the pre-dominant player scanning method within eve. without accompany changes to the scanner system, changes to things like constellation chat, and providing some part alternative to player listing then it makes 0.0 life impossible.so i think it should stay, but i'd love to see some modification to it.2. the debate about pos wars is probably the largest ongoing debate about change within eve atm based on the fact that it covers, massive fleet enounters, capital usage (the dreadnaught ship class), territorial control, and rare resources access. i currently think there are imbalances in some parts of eve that create im-balances in others. if we had a perfect world within no lag then my concerns would be directed at cyno-jammers. i would also have issues with things like mass cap blobbing and the ability to use said cap blobs to control large (asset related, ie. moons) portions of the map that they would otherwise be averse to controlling. within the real eve however just being able to fight under the circumstances we have is a major issue. dynamic load balancing and re-inforced nodes becomes major issues and how to apply them correctly without changing how the fight will unfold.3. i think that the nano changes as they are coming in are hard hitting a problem that is smaller than some people believe. nobody with a hint of common sense can say that poly+gisti+snake+booster+rogue+skirmish linked+overdrives+nanofiber, fitted ships were balanced. poly's needed a nerf and so did snakes. did the whole of speed engagement fighting? no. the nerf hits guerilla tactics much harder than it should. i have yet to playtest other parts of the patch with regard to medium drones(apparently) and web changes but i think in the end players will adapt as they always do. my only real fear being that falcons will become more prevelant after this ;pso, i think it was a little to much, although partly needed, but players will adapt in the end and the whiners will find something new to complain about in short order. 4. as seen in the campaign into delve, and within bob's max campagin, the larger the territory the harder to defend, the smaller the territory the easier to defend. with titan's involved once you hit a certain point of systems left it becomes extremely difficult to make any progress. as it stands atm as well, critical mass to successfully hit a cynojammer, with acceptable losses is about 30rr bs. meaning that to make progress in hostile space you need at least 30-40 people to hit a jammer that is going to receive zero defence. so yes i think the game heavily favors the defender. (mind you i think it should favor the defender) but not so much as it currently does"

"hmmmm... one minor detail though.i hope stuff like lp and standing stays out of the picture.you know a lot of amarr & caldari pilots with good soe standing?didn't think so...."
"according to ccp representatives at the meeting this weekend ccp is doing quite well. one may posit that this is because the majority of their income is in foreign currencies as opposed to the isk. as long as that continues to be the case i don't think there's much room for concern, though the employees in iceland may have a harder time obtaining anything that isn't a fish or water bybroduct."
"theoretically when your home currency value decreases and your revenue is from internal streams you increase revenue.so until iceland's currency rebounds ccp will be making more money than they normally do."
"me too. if there is an exploration ship i would suggest that it is not a new type of class from the existing empires. instead it's probably better done in the same way as ore doing the mining ships. if we consider this as a starting point we can start to look at what we want / need on there.for a start, and this to me would be a balancing point, perhaps no covert ops cloak. it's not a covert ops so if you want to warp about cloaked you can use a covert ops. also a low sensor strength like the marauders would make sense. it's computer systems being dedicated to exploration jigery pokery, giving it no real downside in combat exploration yet diminishing it's pvp uses.if we can agree on these proposals we could scetch in some basics, need highs for probe launcher, mids for electronic gadetry, and drones seem reasonable given its role. anyway just a few thoughts."
"big alliances you say? well yeah, there's two goons on there, but the others are from cva, star fraction, ivy league, electus matari, the ministry of information, the conservative shenanigans party, and the federal defense union. only four of those are even real player-run organizations(two are tiny shells, one is a npc corp), and only one of the seven has any sovereignty. and on top of that, the chair is about the most anti-status-quo person i can think of - he got elected on flipping 0.0 upside-down, and has repeatedly brought forward suggestions for doing so and successfully passed them through the council. and while i admit that i'm not privy to their internal debates, i've never heard any of them say anything about being anti-change, or about deciding that they were going to vote against something because it would negatively effect them personally. human nature being what it is, there's probably been a bit of self-delusion on that last score, but it's still been quite good on the whole."
"good then because isn't that the way things should be."
"this. its crap like this that is breaking the bubble known as player democracy.and ccp, i know that the csm where never supposed to have any power over game design and it's purpose are only to present the opinions of the player base. but what happened to the open dialog that you advertised as ground breaking steps towards an virtual democracy. all i see is a csm that has it's hands tied behind its back, being forced to refer to the dead horse in related discussions as it apparently was not allowed to be discused directly."
"you mis-understand. it's simply too-hard-basket technically for ccp to re-write and re-generate art work to make it happen. so we refered to it in other proposals such as small anchorable structures - where there is no existing art-work, so that at least removes one barrier."
"/supportseriously, wtf ccp"
"ok imma sum up all the reasons why ending \"ghost training\" is dumb right here so people can refer to them all in one big tl;dr:1. it has been referred to as a feature of the game. see any of the twenty posts in the first pages of the dev blog discussion thread for a link to the player guide. obviously, in addition to being a contributing factor to people subscribing to the game (the cancellation of which will obviously result in canceled accounts and possible loss of future customers), this also spells out that ccp is being intentionally deceitful as to their reasons for terminating \"ghost training.\"2. because a player works in eve to make money, not to gain skill points, there is no undue advantage provided to inactive accounts.in eve, skill points are acquired by clicking a button, then coming back in a few days to click another button and train a different skill. there is no hard work involved. instead, work in eve is used to acquire isk, which can even be used to bypass the timesink that is skill training by purchasing more advanced characters. a good metaphor is that of two players, todd and frank. todd lets his account lapse training carrier v, while frank keeps it subscribed while training the same skill. however, over the course of a month, frank works hard to earn isk. at the end of the month, both characters can fly a carrier, but frank, having worked hard and paid his subscription, actually has the carrier.3. ccp gains more money from the subscriptions of multiple sporadically subscribed \"ghost training\" accounts than a single perpetually subscribed account.this one is simple math: let's return to todd and frank. todd runs two accounts over a year, both of which are lapsed and \"ghost training\" for three months out of the year, while frank runs a single account subscribed for the entire year. assuming they both pay in one month intervals of 14.99 per month:todd's accounts: 179.40 * 0.75 * 2 = 269.10frank's account: 179.40 * 1.00 * 1 = 179.40therefore, in addition to not being played for three months out of the year (thus reducing strain on ccp's servers, however little), todd's two \"ghost training\" accounts bring in more money than frank's single perma-subscribed account.there are other reasons, but most of them are on a case-by-case basis, and i figure three massively glaring flaws should be enough to warrant a change of plans.further tl;dr:preventing \"ghost training\" is bad for ccp. many accounts are cancelled and some accounts are never created at all, resulting in less money.preventing \"ghost training\" is bad for players. the true advantage in \"ghost training\" is given to permanently subscribed players, who are constantly earning isk and making more money than \"ghost training\" players, while gaining skill points at the same rate."
"and a quick counterpoint: people who pay to play the game have one massive, distinct benefit over someone who isn't paying: they get to play the game. i pay to play spaceships online, not progressbar online. it's not as equal as one would think."
"this.also, i read the player guide as this is the how the game works, not \"this is how it is intended\" or \"this is not a bug\".ccp has always reserved the right to change anything about their game.for example: i will use pos bowling, as it was ok then declared illegal. if pos bowling was in a player guide, it wouldn't mean that pos bowling was intended, but merely that is how people played the game and that is was doable and a normal tactic. when pos bowling was declared illegal, said hypothetical pos bowling player guide entry would be amended or deleted. seems like a normal thing to do.once again, you are twisting a simple factual statement in the player guide and making assumptions on it. it is simply stating what is possible, not what is supposed to be."
"i'd say it's a pretty reasonable assumption that, when ccp lists information in a player guide, it's done so so that players can then use it. as it stands, ccp is suggesting that \"ghost training\" was always an unintended bug - essentially, an exploit, in the same vein as pos bowling. however, unlike \"ghost training,\" pos bowling has never been used to sell accounts, nor has it been specifically cited in a player guide.which is the bigger leap: that information is there with the intention of being used and cataloged as a feature, or that a known exploit would be listed for years?edit: looking back on my post i see it's a lot of circular-reasoning words based on the fact that vaal's assumption is completely unfounded, here let me sum it up better:\"no guys we're just writing all about it here so you know what it is no we don't want you actually to use it no stop what have you done *ignores it for a few years*\""
"this was a change that needed to be made, and i say that as someone who exploited the hell out of the old system(gallente cruiser v, drone interfacing v, gallente battleship v, and advanced weapon upgrades v were all trained by me while unpaid). it was a system i used to good effect, but that doesn't change that it was a bad system. the one thing i look forward to especially is that this removes one(dumb, but still frequently used) argument against skill queues. no, skill queues will not allow a player to come back to a maxed-out dreadnought pilot after a one-month subscription and three years of waiting."
"the thing is that the only reason skill queues may be added after the removal of ghost training is to appease an angry player base, not because removing ghost training was a prerequisite of establishing a queue (hint: clear the queue when an account is canceled, problem solved). if an argument is dumb, ccp shouldn't even think about using it as justification."
"when you can sell a character for billions of isk that you have been training forever without having to pay is well broken. i do understand that for those people who simply cant pay for whhatever reason..well it could be worse..you could altogether lose that character..it would be within ccp's rights to do so..the fact that ccp has allowed this for 5 years and almost promoted it as a desirable feature is the real problem here."
"i don't want to see this go and i approve of moustache mcgee's message."
"this change is useless and unnecessary."
"i didn't claim ccp used the argument. i don't recall them ever doing so. fools on the forums used that argument. it doesn't make a huge difference that they can't, but it's nice to see it go away nonetheless. and i'd like to see queues be implemented on the grounds that they should have been there since beta, but i'll take what i can get."
"to quote wrangler in the stickied csm meeting thread:so i don't think you're gonna be getting that queue any time soon regardless, seeing as how you logging in and working hard to get those skills switched is one of the reasons subscribers are supposed to have an advantage over ghost trainers. if ccp's been unable to find a good system for implementing a queue, ghost training's removal will have absolutely nothing to do with it."
"after reading the blog and both related threads, i'm against the change."
"gonna cancel my alt and just run 1 account now."
"kill it in order to save the company, or don't, i don't really care. it'll be fun to watch idiots go broke."
"(disclaimer: i do not have an alt, i have not played in 3 months and have been paying the whole time.)dear ccp,get off your lazy asses and deal with the isk farmers (read: anyone name \"xghgjsfdj\" or similarly) in-game instead of killing your profits with your flawed marketing moves. sincerely,- the people who are about to give their stuff (or not, lol) to someone else.p.s. fire the r3tards in marketing.now instead of getting $15 every other month or so from alt owners or even people who take breaks once in a while, they'll get nothing! brilliant!if this goes through, i'm going to jettison every. single. corpse i have right outside jita 4-4 right before i cancel my account."
"yes, thank you ccp !!!!"
"\"bug\" or not, something that has been in the game this long that this many players feel strongly about should not be changed."
"no support here. i really don't see whats wrong with asking people to pay their subscriptions while training skills."
"less money for them is what's wrong. that and i can't take a break for a month to train a 30 day skills after paying the 3 months before training all the 3-12 day skills for it. not only are people most likely not coming back after taking said break or not renewing their alts, there are far more pressing matters at hand like isk farmers, lag, and fixing the ui, but no, let's \"fix\" the ghost training instead, in a feeble, yet flawed attempt at making more money.i'd like to meet the dev that though this was a good idea, so i could give him a nice punt kick in the ass with my steel toed boots."
"it has pros and cons really, if you look at the big picture.people that have to go away from eve had something to return for, their long-run skill finishing.on the other hand there are people creating a bunch of alts while strategically letting them lapse until they're ready to, like, be sold off or gather research points (while the account is not paid for either).i understand ccps reasons, but i think the problem is inherent in the way the skill system is done, in that there is no way to progress your character in game, no way to catch up with older players, and spending your first month only training those darned learning skills. of course, whatever is changed to the skill system now is going to result in a whine just as big as this one is.in it's current form, all of this sounds like a money grab.thats why i want two things from ccp in return for this nerf:30 day gametime codes back now!a skill queue!"
"this will only make quitters not come back any more."
"good move to make less subcribers :)"
"maybe you should delete inactive accounts too :)"
"the skillsystem was one of the main reasons i played eve. if i have to pay for looking at the progress bar, then i can go and play wow too, it's the same therethanks ccp, after 3 years in the game i'm fed upedit: and btw, why aren't you disabling multi-accounting too? i think it's a bug in the account creation system"
"its a good move to remove the train while you don't pay ability. it never made a lot of sense, and really only benefits the experienced alt-multiple-account crowd, widening the gap between casual and dedicated players even further.it is a poor move to do so after (by their own words) many people started to use this feature. if the game has this bug for so long, so much that many players start actively using it to their benefit, you will **** off a lot of people if you suddenly remove the feature.more of a pro-active and less of a re-active policy would work wonders for pr in that respect."
"actually, my prediction for the future (especially if eve does not increase its rate of growth) is that the pool of older characters for sale will grow and grow, and thus will get cheaper and cheaper. more and more beginning players would be tempted to sell a couple of gtc's and buy these characters. thus the proportion high-sp characters and low-sp characters will continue to shift, effectively making low-sp players an (insignificant) minority and the need to buy characters greater and greater.all these people who might decide to discontinue some of their accounts/alts, some might decide to try and sell them or even move them to their main accounts, increasing the amount of available high-sp's."
"lol.i love eve's skill system because it doesn't require me to gridn.the fact that non-paying accounts still had skill training going on always struck me as more of a bug then anything else.i mean, seriously, what is the fuss about? yeah, it forces you to pay for the 4 alt accounts all training skills who you don't play, but i don't see anything wrong with that. for accounts you play on, you're going to keep them subscribed and actually play the game."
"how about making the change at only 48 hours notice, directly after running a promotion to encourage people to start a second account.and then lying about why they did it.and then lying about it being a bug.and then deleting proof that they lied.do you see what's wrong with those?i'm mildly peeved about losing ghost training; i won't bother with my dread alt any more; ccp will lose the 3 or 4 1-month subscriptions it would have taken to train him and and the 20 euro transfer fee and i won't get a dread alt to help support my alliance. ccp and i both lose out here. i guess i'll have that account as insurance in case anything happens to one of my mains, or maybe i'll win the lottery and have the time and money to manage another active account. who knows.i'm absolutely incensed by the high-handed, dishonest and extremely disrespectful way in the way that ccp removed ghost training. first we were fed some utter guff about \"game balance\" and \"complaints\", then they tried to claim that inactive characters place a high load on the database , then an outright lie that ghost training was a bug - many times disproven, including with a screen shot of wrangler's own forum post advising players of this feature, i mean \"bug\", and finally they grudgingly semi-admitted that they just want the money.we were lied to. we were treated like idiots, and told it was for our own good. we were lied to again. dishonesty and disrespect are the issues here.frankly this affair has destroyed what little faith i had left that ccp have a long term interest in eve. my characters represent a very considerable investment for me, and now i'm wondering if i should realise that investment while it's still worth anything."
"and this crap comes in just as im about to start lv5 bs which takes 37 fricken days.they take years to sort somthing out for jita then they take a few days to think, hmm i could make more money out of people who cant be arsed waiting for a skill that takes over a month to do.any think that improves the game they take ages to do, things that make it worse takes a week.c*nts"
"against the change"
"well im not happy with this change, but it was rather predictable, island gone bankrupt and ccp is going to leech money from customers in every possible way"
"canceling my 5 accounts as soon as they open the account management section back up."
"supporting this despite the fact that ccp won't change their minds.i'm actually pretty disgusted that ccp tried to palm this off as a bug fix."
"signed"
"this sets a dangerous precedent. what's next on inactive accounts? rp? market orders? contracts? research slots? manufacturing slots?will npc slots be forever taken if someone lapses an account? will they lose that slot and the result if they happen to miss a day's payment? will their orders no longer be visible and operating?i can just about cope with the ghost training change, but it really does send the wrong message.edit: oh and i agree with what malcanis wrote. since i wrote my equivalent in the main feedback blog thread, i won't repeat it here."
"can i have your stuff?"
"hell this is great.... i see a great potential of <coughmoronscough> leaveing the population of eve online.means bigger fights...less lag.<raises glass of wine> cheers."
"make me a favor a drive a nail through your ear, n00b."
"sorry... haven't had my tetanus (sp?) shot.besides... i ran out when i couldn't drown out the whining. : o p"
"skill training on a lapsed account really isnt that much of an issue, it brought people back to this game. and so what if people used it to train alts, you had to sub that alt for 30 days at a time in order to set the next skill. this was more money in ccp's pocket. a large number of v skills finish before 30 days, so you usually would have an alt account 30 days on, 20ish days off (unless you were training a rank 8+ skill to v). i always thought training skills was to be detached from actually playing the game. a person ghost training a skill isnt logged in with that character and isnt playing the game or effecting the game world with that character. the end result of this will be a huge drop in subscriptions for ccp, people will not find it worth it to keep alt accounts going and will just transfer their alts to their main accounts and forget training all together after they get the alt built. what they should do instead is prevent rp gains while on an inactive account and introduce a skill queue that only works on active accounts. these 2 things would fix a needed advantage, and would add to the game in a way most players want and would find very convienent.i was up until recently considering getting an alt account so i can train up some useful alts, now it seems like a worthless idea and would just cost too much extra money for a character i will not be playing that often."
"ccp should just get rid of trial accounts. as a paying account holder, i object to other people playing for free! this is an exploit! (i know, they advertised this \"trial\" as a feature for a long time.) plz fix asap."
"t.t"
"thinking of doing just that atm.have 3 accounts, might transfer to 1 account taking the main off each account"
"i say let the skill that's currently being trained, complete. if there's more in the queue, it stops training. this gives added peace of mind for subscribers and less peace of mind for people that want to take advantage of this. i\"m still against the proposed ghost training nerf."
"new sound effects would be an awesome addition."
"i am completely against this change, and i almost never fly nano. it is easy enough to counter and harder to do than than the carebears would think. this change would also make it impossible to bump ships out of the docking radius of a station leading to ungodly amount of docking/undocking station games."
"against this crap"
"i'm against the nano nerf"
"yes way, stop this nerf!!"
"againstyeah no i don't think this a good idea at all,"
"i am against the nanno nerf- its not hard to kill a nano-vaga-or ishtar-- there are ships and tatics for that if ya cant handle that go back to carebear land---- if your gonna be in 0.0 grow some and stop crying--and o yea time to pay for your training muhahahahah"
"i'm against the nano nerf cus'ummmmm i live in fountain which is conveniently placed for snake droppage and autumn walks, so long live the nano ***."
"can his go on the front burner now that everyone has to shut up about ghost training?"
"now that ghost training is gone this makes even more sense because now people can't abuse it (pick 3 30 day skills and train them all for free)./signed."
"if you need to seduce players to log into your game by having a user-unfriendly skill training mechanic, i would say you don't have a lot of confidence in the fun of your gameplay. personally, i've not seen or spoken to anyone that logs into the game to change a skill and then magically changes his mind and stays to play.i've seen plenty of people log on to the game to play *after* a skill is finished recently, so they can enjoy its benefits. if you come home, knowing that you can finally fly assault frigates, and can take out your lovely retri for a spin, that *will* motivate people to log in more. usually i simply choose to lose skill training, spending 5 minutes to start up eve, login, navigate to skill and switch training and then logging out again feels like an idiotic chore. also, to have corp mates pop on, say hi and seconds later log off is a common occurence (skill change visits). i don't think this enhances gameplay in any way.i don't see any need for limitations, especially now that you can't train skills while not paying. only difficulties i would see are technical in nature."
"give damn facking queue !!!"
"now that you are getting rid of ghost training why can't you give us a bone and let us have skill-queues? we log in to play a game, not to micromanage skill-swapping.and i already klicked support box earlier."
"i would change to wow just to spite ccp but wow is evil i tell ya.any how, as you have taken away ghost training like 10 days b4 i need to do bs lv5, you ****s, alteast give us a proper skill queue so people dont have to log on a stupid times of the day to change.and no that will not make people play less, it just lets them get more sleep.and dont worry ccp, you ****s, you will still get our money for doing bugger all for us."
"might as well do this, since if an account doesn't train while unsubbed there's not much of a reason to keep an alt around."
"this makes dollars, so it also makes sense."
"hrm... just remove inactive chars from eve altogether.it's like they never existed. :iiam:"
"support"
"these are arguably worse than ghost training, in that they generate isk, the real bread and butter of eve, without any subscription or effort. i'd elaborate but i already wrote a bunch of words about it in like three different threads so whatev"
"you have my axe... erm, i meansupportwhy let people make isk without paying for it if they can't train skills without paying for it."
"constancy is good."
"^^^ it's \"consistency.\""
"supported"
"lets run this **** into the ground"
"while i don't like this decision, ccp's method of informing us, or the short notice...i have to agree. if they're going to do it, they shouldn't half-*** it."
"in the name of consistently ****ing up the game, sure, why not!"
"/signed"
"if ghost training is removed, all of this must all go into effect on inactive accounts, as that would seem to be the most fair of things."
"this just sounds like a bunch of suicidal fans that want to make sure to nail in the final nails in eve's coffin.i agree. strip all the features out of an unsubscribed account. let's get this band-aid ripped off fast and let the hemmhoraging of ccp's cashflow begin."
"hell must be cold tonight because i am supporting a goon"
"this is a good idea. all of these poor capsuleers who are being cheated by ghost training surely must hate inactive accounts existing in any aspect of the \"game\". under ccp's insectoid logic, we must remove all inactive accounts from any aspect of the game because waaah it isnt fair. let's be honest ccp, dont take us for fools. no one is whining about people ghost training, this is about you getting your hands on every penny you can pinch. i almost think the announcement of the ghost training removal wouldn't be so bad if you would have just admitted from the get go that this maneuver is about making the money required for you to maintain the server, not about \"capsuleers\" putting energy into the game. as for ghost training being \"unintended\"....\"skills continue training even if you are logged off or if your account is inactive (in the second scenario you can't change skill training, though). as a result, it is a good idea to train short skills while you are playing and longer ones when you log off. if you want to switch skills, you can simply do so by starting another skill training. the points gained on the previous skill will not be lost, but you don't benefit from the training until the level is fully completed. the highest level for any skill is level 5, but some skills also have an advanced version. some of those advanced skills influence the same area as the basic version, others only a related area.\"so in the spirit of shafting your player base, by all means, lets run this game into the ground so that maybe the capsuleers wont put any energy or money into this game."
"supporting this, let ccp put its feet into a meat grinder.hopefully lag and disconnects will disappear when the rp don't get accumulated once a day /endsarcasmalso i suggest that ccp should immediately delete an account, all characters on it and stuff, as soon as the account becomes inactive."
"eve is getting a little stale, i think i'll let some accounts lapse so i can pay for more hookers and beer. 3 months down the road, i start feeling a little twitchy and am thinking about maybe relapsing and hitting the ol' space-crackpipe again. my incentives to come back include:gallente carrier v completednice pile of accumulated passive incomenot coming back at all and going outside. if you're gonna screw it up, at least be consistent about it. supported."
"i don't like this. i cant use my card here my bank is blocking all international charges. so i buy gtc with paypal. but other then that i like this."
"totally agree. no matter who much hard earned cash people spent creating and using accounts on eve the moment they stop paying they are worthless scum who are freeloading off the system and everyone else and should have everything they were told they could have in the game taken away. and i don't think more then one days notice would sound unreasonable to me."
"if ccp really have to do this then i agree they should completely disable anything that could advantage a disabled account."
"it's possible to have an inactive account for a year or more, come back, and drop a huge load of datacores on the market. enough to seriously mess with the market for that core for weeks.that's vastly more disruptive than anything ghost training does(which is basically nothing)."
"i have no experience in r&d but i do have knowledge of contracts and buy/sell orders. and i think if something's worth doing, it's worth doing right(eyes on the ether.)my vote, character must not be able to profit at all if the account the player is part of is not actively subscribed. could mark the sell/buy orders in the db as not to be listed on the market, almost as simple as that."
"if ccp are going to screw us over, they might as well screw us over royally and do it right. momma always said it ain't worth trying if you're not gonna do it right."
"why go half hog with a stupid idea when you can run with it!"
"momma always said like was like a box of chocolate, you never know when you're gonna get punt kicked in the butt.or something like that."
"stop lp = yeacorp closure / market cancel = naydeleting very old characters (specially on trial accounts), and corporations without any members = yea"
"agreed.imho, banning \"goast tranin\" is a positive step, so they should go one step further and nerf account processes in general."
"supporting goon trolls"
"goons are being sarcatic trolls per usual. but i agree with killing rp and market orders (if possible) would be consistent with ghost skilling. the difference between market orders/rp and sp is that you cannot just 'pause' a market order or pause your rp. you can cancel market orders/rp, but that is different from pausing as you lose all current rp. if ccp wrote a way to pause all orders/rp and other stuff then i fully support this.not being able to reactivate an account with gtcs makes zero sense however. you not are profiting with an inactive account, so that doesn't make any sense at all.weak troll .5/10"
"yes to a stop on rp gain for inactive accounts, so that the legitimate players can earn more with them.on the other hand it makes invention more expensive and that's not a good development, but that system should be overhauled anyway."
"all is good up until...gtcs are cold hard cash. some of us cant subscribe through ccp shop.. i forget the error or whatever i got when i tried but it wouldnt work.trading isk for gtc codes securely just makes sense."
"did not read op."
"absolutely, i've been calling for this for months"
"ghost research points should be removedother changes are not needed"
"i hate you all"
"if ccp are removing 'ghost training' then i see no reason for them not to do this too."
"yes."
"i'm going to say no on the basis that i'm against the disabling of ghost training anyway as a bad precedent that caused all this crap, promoted by a bunch of whiners who seem to want every mmo out there to be absolutely the same.why not go the whole way and just have us earn sp on blowing ships up and therefore no sp earning unless you're playing the game (which should sound familiar territory to those from other mmos), and forget about all the things that made eve the game it was?"
"supported (if only because this will make me ****loads of isk)"
"only right to halt all functions on an inactive account while it is inactive."
"++"

"yep yep."
"very much agree."
"i can hear the screaming on the forums now my bank screwed up my direct debits.and you deleted my accounts,wheres my dreadnought/freighter/battleship/etc/etc/etc"
"op is nothing but logical and consistent. end rp/market/research exploitation by unsubbed alts now."
"1.0"
"supported"
"consistency++"
"i'd agree with it, without the non-gtc option. simply because with multiple accounts, it's easy and frequent enough that an account goes inactive because you weren't watching the days remaining on the account. transferring isk to the inactive account, from an active one, should still be possible."
"i love this idea."
"supported"
"i'm all for consistency."
"this needs implemented if ghosting is an imbalance, then getting rp (and thus isk) while inactive should be blocked, too, and right away."
"accounts should be frozen, for six months then deleted. to allow for minor misshaps to be avoided.i.e. people in hospitals the forces etc"
"this is an issue extremely important to the success of eve."
"i agree with all points but reactivation using real currency.gtcs are purchased using real currency, and whether the holder of the gtc decides to use an in game mechanic in order to exchange it for isk with another player should not be a factor. ccp still profits from the sale as they would a normal transaction."
"yeah, if you're no longer able to accumulate skill points on an unsubbed account, there's really no reason why you should be permitted to acquire research points or sell items through the market/contracts either.ending this inconsistency would also mean less easy isk entering the game and distorting the market."
"i find the whole idea of inactive accounts accruing rps unfair. support suppension of rp gathering/all market buy and sell orders."
"yes"
"seems reasonable"
"disable all inactive account progress not just skill training.:diecccpdie:"

"since these forums have something to do with the game i assume i can still raise this issue.i'd like the forum mods to be a lot more heavy handed on the forums.obvious trolls, spamming childish catchphrases (ibtl, \"first!!\" etc) these things should incur a warning, with a second infraction resulting in a temp ban. (if it was my choice you wouldn't even get the warning) thankfully the \"signed\" spam was stopped, but it's time to take out the rest of the trash.out of all the forums i've read, this would have to be the one with the worst signal to noise ratio.you don't need an account to read the forums, and dare i say if i'd browsed the forums before signing up to play eve, i would've thought twice before subscribing. this game has an awesome community, unfortunately the forums don't reflect this at all.just a quick glance at the front page of general discussion at the moment shows about 10 threads having been locked for spamming/being useless threads. the people posting these should be warned/temp banned so that those serious about this game/community don't have to wade through that sort of thing.so basically i'm advocating for stricter rules on the forums to hopefully increase the quality of posting."

"reduce training times by 50% ive been playing eve for awhile now and have two accounts, presently on one alt i am looking at training frigates, cruisers, battle cruisers & battleships to lvl 5. this will take 3 months to train with my learning skills of 4/4, this time makes me think should i bother, should i do train something else, or should i quit.now with the ghost training nerf im finding that paying continuously to achieve these skills is just not worth the money spent to achieve lvl5 skills.my proposal is to reduce all training times by 50% so training doesnt make you quit eve with what i call training boredom. and to placate all the paying long term pilots they are given 50% of the skill points they have at the time of implantation to use on which ever skills they choose."
"been there, done that. you'll make it through. ;)if you want to be perfect in something, it takes time. my advice is to widen your abilities and go for flexibility instead of ultraspecialization. and get the learning skills to 5 on the tier 1 skills."
"i see no reason to decrease the training times.after all, you can always play the game while you're waiting for that skill to reach v."
"by decreasing training times you suddenly have a major problem on your hands.noobs show up with battleships and larger vessels... and traffic gets to be a major problem.might wana think before you post."
"this is a random solution that doesn't address the issue you're really concerned about - removal of 'ghost' training. if removal of ghost training is the issue, it'll get a better result by discussing in those threads on how to improve it."

"if a cyno can be fired in high-sec, there is no logic by existing game rules that any capital ship be able to lock onto the signal and jump-in.additionally, as mentioned in previous posts, it would make eve a small place with little meaning in market differentiation."
"why can black ops jump in and out.sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander. lets have consistancy at least."
"agreed on that. maybe the issue is because jump freighters are not covert-ships?pilot a: \"hey .. i'm sure i just saw a ship the size of a small moon .. where did it go?\"pilot b: \"it cloaked!\"pilot a: \"yeah right.\""
"somewhere in the middle is \"eve online\" and the people who play it. allowing ships to cyno into high sec is silly. cyno into lowsec and use a gate. just like a normal freighter."

"there is a trend now for pirates to join a militia faction as either a sister corp to a pirate organization or as individuals. in any case they show blue to their targets and are killing their fellow militia members. there doesn't seem to be any mechanics other than word of mouth to stop this. militia fw need a voice and some control over these individuals. recommend that csm look into having players have some say on corps and individual(s). something along the lines of a \"misconduct board\" with the ability to discharge from the fw individuals that are not in the spirit of the game."

"don't know what your talking about. got 3 blues today with a pirate corp, killing militia in amamake. its not a solo trick. there is no way to eject these people from militia as you can in any other corp or alliance. as for attacking you. you really should read what you posted. my post is not a whine, there needs to be a mechanism in place to build a foundation.. even a npc one."
"i'm not really sure you understand how pl operates if you think for a second that we wouldn't enjoy the hell out of bob invading."
"i fail to see the problem, whether they are in militia or not they're going to kill you."
"shoot them when they go flashy (in lowsec) - if you are in a militia npc entity. wardec them and fight back - if you are in a fw aligned corp.use the systems in place to organize and gain revenge for these slights. this is not any kind of \"issue\" that csm or ccp need to address."
"they lose a load of standing if they do that right, and will be booted from the militia quite soon, at least that was the idea. could you look up how big a standing hit these guys are getting?"
"well i think a solution would be to allow megacorporations/conglomerates can claim 0.0 for a faction!this would mean that player groups could choose to work to expand their chosen empire's borders. cva might decide they want to remain separate from the empire and so not chose that path, but a megacorporation might join a faction and work to claim sov for that faction as well. so when megacorp u'k decides to try and take parts of providence from cva, it might actively claim those systems for the republic.but maybe i am off my rocker."
"no. if you want to join then quit your alliance.ccp allowing alliances to join fw would severly mess up fw severly. no alliance should be allowed to join fw."
"we're had the 2nd formal meeting with ccp (over the last couple of weekends) and while i can't say anything officially as yet on the precise minutes (waiting formating and approval) lets just say things are looking pretty good for this proposal its been a bit of a fight and lots of anti-feeling from a tiny (but vocal) minority inside fw but ultimately i think everyone sensible realizes that you just can't have bits of eve content roped off from the rest of the game and inaccessible to the very players who are likely to enjoy it most and bring a lot to the table.it was always an aberration that rp alliances like ushra'khan and the cva were barred from fw - i very much hope and expect to see this resolved in the near future."
"i think this could be a good thing, it could add a bit of structure to the fw militias that have had problems with leadership!"
"while i like the rp flavour, i'm not sure how you would handle the specifics. wouldn't this still be giving the sov holding entity the benefits of 0.0 holdings? if so, is there a reason why players would choose not do this? i had three teeth taken out this morning so maybe i'm not grasping something yet. ;)you are not giving any reason why alliances would be a bad thing. what impact does letting an alliance in that a large and wealthy corp does not already have?not all alliances hold 0.0 space, own high-end moons or even can field large fleets. those that do have little to no interest in fw anyway."
"ok i can support this idea...only question is will this work the same way as drone regions..ie accesible only by exploration?"
"i honestly dont know how those drone regions work... i was under the impression that the faction drone bpcs drop from exploration. though the rats in asteroid belts are also rogue drones."
"here is an idea that i hope will add some neat content for mission runners and also perhaps (devilishly) please our pirates. why not introduce escalating missions that during each step will bring mission runners deeper into low sec while at the same time deliver escalating rewards.now these would be optional missions with a disclaimer that refusing the mission would not cause loss of standings ,however once it is accepted then if a player decides to cancel mission would cause a loss of standing."
"this would not push highsec players into lowsec.it would just fill the wallet and toolboxes of lowsec players.bad trade. eventually highsec players would only be more deterred from going lowsec.also the depth of lowsec is totally meaningless. the lowsec systems closest to highsec are usually the most dangerous and most camped. this would just increase and make things worse."
"low sec wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so greatly gate camped and pirated....but it is... and no one will find a solution to that because chaos is vastly encouraged."
"actually, there is a rather simple solution that would even underline what lowsec really is, instead of making it a 0.0 mirror.instead of full fleet and concord presence in highsec and practically none in lowsec, ccp could just have empire fleet groups randomly roam and patrol the lowsec systems. the higher the security rating, the more likely meeting a patrol until in 0.1 it will rarely ever happen. more chaos, even less predictable, yet less pirate friendly. they'd actually have to evade the law, instead of just not having to worry about it. that is not the topic here, though."
"i see your point..well back to the drawing board lol"
"roaming patrols of even concord and empire at random intervals would be intriguing.you should post an idea on that.it would discourage intense gate camping raise on high sec borders.and anything nearer to .1 space would be overlooked as it borders on 0.0 space.i like this.i'll be keeping an eye out for that.it kinda makes a nice transition from high sec being \"safer\" and low sec being..... less safer... as opposed the literally taking a deep dive into the unknown."
"as many of you know by now, on wednesday, oct 15th, ccp will put out a server update disabling \"ghost training\". ghost training was an unintended feature where unpaid accounts of eve online were able to continue training skills. while this allowed players to run multiple characters on a shoestring budget, in all effect, this was a bug.it should be noted that we're not changing offline skill training for active subscribers in any way. this change only affects those who do not have an active subscription.does that mean that ccp is a greedy money chewing monster that just loves nerfing things? of course not. we're a company like everyone else, we make a game, that we happen to love making and for most of us is the passion of our lives. but it's also a company. we make a product, sell it, get salaries and then continue maintaining the product and making it better.now i'm not saying that if me personally would be at the other end of this dev blog i wouldn't be annoyed by ccp's actions. we are gamers. we game the system. we figure out how to maximize our returns. there's no surprise that people have done this for the simple fact that it wasn't banned per se and also for the fact that it was possible. but recently we have seen a surge in this behavior in a way that we were essentially supporting and maintaining a large number of customers that weren't paying us regular subscriptions. that's not fair towards ccp as a service provider and it's not fair towards other players that pay a subscription but don't make use of this bug.now a single customer that doesn't log into the servers may not weigh heavily on our database infrastructure, just as a single snowflake isn't that heavy, hardly a measurable quantity. but it's hard not to notice an avalanche if it hits you. and that's what was starting to happen in our database.we can look at this from a variety of angles, but it all comes down to: 1. there was a way to progress a character in eve without an active subscription 2. ccp noticed a surge in the trend and decided to fix the leak 3. players now have to pay a subscription for characters to have them progresswe truly hope that the community will understand our actions and continue to enjoy playing eve as much as we enjoy making it.torfi frans olafssonsenior producer of eve onlineyea you are money grubbing thieves.i have had up to 8 accounts feeding you cash and as the economy died so did my spending cash so i have already had to thin it out. you say this is unfair to people who work their chars? i still use and grind all of my accounts and to save money i let them expire to finish skills to save a few of my bucks. you rotten ingrates guarantee that all people with active accounts don't just log on to train and never undock i will say ok. until then keep looking for more reasons to charge more and come up with flimsy reasons that are ******ed at best. i have 3 active accounts active at all times and you want more? you are finding new and improved ways to rip people off and jacked up time periods for gtcs. there is no question you are after the money nothing more."
"i really wonder how many total threads were created due to this ...... unpleasantness. seriously, i don't think this is something that the eve community will get over, and i really don't think that ccp has seen the last of this.. wait until others come back to find their accounts still not skilled up in a month.... way to go ccp for killing their accounts. seriously, if i had inactive accounts and i came back... i wouldn't play your game, just out of spite, and in fact i'd trash you to all the blog sites - which in fact is being done now.... good luck with all of that.."
"i have the solution!!!!!!!!!!!!!!as per the laws and regulations of the u.s. any and all false advertisements are subject to fines imprisonment and or lawsuit. you come after my wallet i come after yours. this is not a threat it is a promise. a foreign country based corporation selling their product in this country does fall under this topic."
"normally i would fight against this. but ccp is starting to risk it's very survival. this game relies on hardcore players. hardcore players often times are smart and will not take much ****. ccp is risking it's survival by raising gtcs, and caning ghost training. i say this because they were 2 things that have been stable throughout the game and have helped make eve what it is. ccp is currently upgrading server hardware. this means there will be loads of old hardware either re-routed to other portions of the game or tossed. take 1, one of those old opteron blades, and code it to be the ghost training server. voila, nothing lost from the eve cluster that isn't of less then negligable value that will be paid for by the every other payments from those ghost trainers. money in the door is still money in the door, and ghost trainers are using up way less resources then everyone else and you manage to turn a profit from the average player, so you'll be making a profit from ghost trainers as well. as for gtcs, you blabbed about how it was a money choice. you guys made money selling them at 14.95 per month, now you've raised them to 34.95 for 2 months. thats an extra $5, not much right? wrong. many eve players are not financially well of, even more have families, and still more have wives that won't tollerate a nearly $20 a month us game. money in the door is still money in the door. be patient like all the players who train lvl 5 skills, training corporate titan is a rank 55 lvl 5 skill. every time you chase a player out of eve, you're losing money and gaining nothing but a bad rep. don't become the next blizzard, you will regret it ccp. you will regret it and die as the hardcore players, the backbone of eve, leave, ruining your game forever.i support ccp learning from it's mistakes, the carrier nerf was a bad idea, so you looked elsewhere, making gtcs cost more and killing ghost training is a bad idea, look elsewhere, we know you can do it."
"greed...ccp you should be ashamed of yourself....i have been playing for about 6 months now...and this will probably be enough for me to tell you to stick your game...i play everyday , for hours on end....grinding my character through what is at most times ...a grind.and according to you ..my newly started alt doesnt deserve to train 5 days of skill training off account, while i play and grind my original character everyday..i think your greed may have just overtaken your respect for the people who support your game day in and day out...theres many ways you could have handled your situation with people training extra long skills in ''ghost'' mode...why not limit the days to 30 ....why not do lots of things...and dont try to tell me its not just about money...cause you certaintly dont care what happens to mine...i hope you get your money....because you may need it with the accounts you might just lose..shame on you...yours sincerly hacked off.huntedmaster and my now ripped of alt regoroth"
"ccp will do what they want and will always apply what they deem as important to them, whatever is voted for or not will only ever get approval if they want it to,as a gm said to me once 'its our game, we can do what we want end of the day'same can be said for players in a way - only interested in themselves and what directly affects them and nothing else, so whats the point in raising a topic with this issue? none unfortunately"
"alright,let's play with an analogy a bit.ccp runs a lemonade stand. they make eve lemonade. i like their lemonade, it's sour and bitter, but still more refreshing than the other guy's lemonade. the next day i see ccp ****ing into the lemonade jar and when confronted about it they tell you, \"its our lemonade, we can do what we want end of the day.\" i then take my money and either buy the other guy's lemonade or go to the store and buy myself something else.\"it's our game, deal with it\" is no way to sell a game."
"i know that and i know the playerbase knows that but unfortunately ccp never will - either learn to accept it or dont ccp's strengh in customer service will never return - ive accepted that now i just play the game so i can keep in contact with friends ive made and damn ccp"
"so if i do not pay my account my charicters stop training till i pay my account.i can live with that."
"it's a bugfix. live with it. it doesn't take something away that you payed for. it takes something away for which you did not pay. how many other games keep feeding inactive accounts? a lot of games don't even keep them for reactivation for long."
"then keep some of the accounts inactive. what's the problem?why do you think you should have some sort of \"right\" to have 8 accounts training skills with paying three subscriptions?lol. you're not being a customer when you don't pay for your accounts, so you have 0 rights to anything. what makes you think that you've got some rights while not paying a dime? i guess threatning people with lawsuits because you cannot have free stuff is the us way."
"well as a us citizen i assure you not all of us are so damn petty i find it amazing that you're getting so insanely bent out of shape out of something so small. you're exploiting the game and you complain when ccp removes said exploit? lawl. pathetic."
"what part of \"subscription service\" did you not get?you don't pay... you don't get service.how can you possibly hope to even sue or take legal action when the judge would laugh you out of the court over a freaking game you didn't want to pay for but still wish to play for nothing.get a life.... sheesh.ps: id say gb2wow but you have to pay for that too... : o p"
"i think what people don't understand is that it gives eve a uniqueness that was not found in other games. the military man, the family man, the very busy school student, can pause the game and pick up without feeling like the eve world passed them by. that's something other games cannot provide, and i think that's why others are thinking of trying out other space games that are in the works - at least they don't nerf features that are actually useful to them. ccp made this game something that for 5 years people saw as something that fit their lifestyle - it may not have been the best game out there but the skill training motivated them to mission run, to pirate, and to make the eve-verse what it is today. ccp in effect made it so that you pay for their bandwidth and overhead costs while you use them - not while you don't use them. i think that's the biggest issue - people are busy and don't play eve when they don't have the time. sure some people may take advantage of the system, but it costs ccp nearly nothing to keep them on board, and eventually those people pay out. now with this setup, i think a lot of people are refusing to submit to ccp's demands. i know i'm not going to be happy about it - and i don't even use this feature. that feature is security for me. it states if i get bored, i can leave and when i come back, i don't have to start where i left off. people feel betrayed. people see this as ccp being unloyal to them. when there's a breech of loyalty, people lose respect and loyalty for those who don't stay loyal. i really do believe this change could very well kill eve online, and if the majority of people leave eve... there's no point for me being on eve either..."
"same here.people need to stop crying about the change and get the hell over it. ccp is not going to change their mind just because of a bunch of whiners are telling them to.life goes on, get over it."
"easy for you to say, you're not the one who's only got 15 mill sp and can only use t2 small hybrids."
"thank you.. i was starting to think i was losing my my mind with all the whining."
"due to the extremely low survivabilty of the eas (paper thin and thus at the top of the primary list in most pvp fights) they should be allowed to use the covert jump bridge to give them more of role in combat and give the black ops a much needed boost."
"they're frigatesfrigates are no meant to be survivable. they're cheap ships that fill a niche. if you want more survivability train into recons."
"yeah, i agree, but this isn't about adding survivability really, it's about making them more effective at being portalled into enemy space and making them more mobile. supported ;)."
"for now, with the fuel issues as they are, this would give black ops a slightly greater punch since all of the other ships that can go through the tunnels are paper thin. sb's and recons can both benefit from the cover of eas's.with this addition, the handful of paper thin ships that can go through the portal would have more bite and since eas's are light, they can be sent through like sb's en masse.it'd make a decent team. eas can incapacitate responders or defenders while sb's etc do their thing. fly 15 or so through the portal and bring the hurt onto lonely ratters and miners.goes without mentioning that bops, with their crappy scan res, could use eas wingmen to increase their survivability. again, the light mass of eas and sb support hulls could allow a bops, even with current fuel situation, to pop in and back out with a covops or recon in local as the only warning."
"/me thumbs up"
"this will make things a lot more fun edit: support is lol"
"why does everyone want to make it a friggin t2 ship?on second thought just give me whatever ships rats can fly that drops a 20m trit load and can loot."
"i believe that ccp should set a date and give notice well in advance when making significant changes such as the removal of ghost training and the nano-nerf.example one: ghost trainingon monday 13th october ccp announce they're removing ghost training on wednesday 15th october. this is pretty horrible for anyone who's gameplan involves taking advantage of ghost training, especially if they're in the middle of a long skill. a much more palatable decision would have been to announce on the 13th that ghost training would end in, say, 3 months time, or possibly at the end of the year. that would lessen the nasty shock factor and give the players a little room to adjust and replan.example two: the nano-nerfwhilst we've known that this is going to happen in some form or other for quite a while, no date has been fixed. this is rather unfair on anybody who wishes to play with nano-tactics in the meanwhile, there's no way of telling how good an investment polycarbing a ship or buying a snake set is when it could be when they could be snatched away from you at a few days notice. again, setting a date for the nerf would make this a lot fairer; say three months after the changes are decided and finalised."
"**** ye"
"yea, the ghost training thing kind of screwed over people who had taken advantage of the power of two offer. it seems hard to imagine that ccp didn't know they were considering nerfing ghost training before the power of two offer; so it would have been nice for those people to have had some forewarning."
"i'm not sure what more to add. on the overview there should be a little icon next to every roid, just like the icons that tell you who is warp scrambling you etc. this icon will serve to show you if a roid is already being mined by somebody else, that is it's only purpose. maybe it could even tell you who exactly is mining it in the tool tip when you mouse over it. the icon could also be multi-colored, white for neutral, green for corp members and purple for fleet members.this helps in just that situation that you mentioned, when you have a ton of people mining the same belt so they aren't \"mining over\" each other. mining the same roid is counter productive because if 2 people are mining the same roid and one person kills it before the other one whoever's mining lasers finish first gets all the ore, and the other person doesn't get anything. at present the only way to counter this is to carefully select roids in space that don't have a laser on them (which is tedious and also can throw you out of alignment if you're clicking on a roid too fast and start to move toward it instead of selecting it), or to just randomly pick roids on the overview and hope you don't overlap other people.this is an easy solution to the problem and a sure fire way to keep people from mining the same roid."
"could you not just move to another belt?i don't think this would be worth the programming effort, given other priorities."
"you can already uses tags can you not?"
"well i had a crazy idea..much as we have escalating exploration sites why not have optional escalating missions that will lure players deeper into low sec..i say optional as in if player refuses they dont lose standings..anyway cheers on the rest."
"i made a clarification."
"eon is made by a separate publisher (mmmpublishing) under license, so it's totally outside the realm of influence of the csm."
"the the problem that needs to be fixed is there is no way to repair a disfunctional council/members that cannot work together in a civilized way to identify, analyze and promote the issues effecting eve players. i would define a disfunctional council/members as those that spend the majority of their time having non-eve related arguments about their respective characters to the point of abuse.forum bans are an indicator of this problem. there are many others seen at the start of the first csm, where a lot of that energy could be directed to helping eve, and had no actual benefit to the purpose of the csm what-so-ever.in regards to \"not everything has to have a benefit to the purpose of the csm, the csm are only human\" argument belittles the humans who are capable of getting down to business. are they sub-human? i don't think so, i think they're fit for purpose.unfortunately the nature of \"internet space games\" and lack of real-world or real-consequences for being unsuitable for position of responsibility mean that there is no existing (please someone think of one) way for vetting player appropriately with an election.in rl there are multiple-elections before making it to the top, but in eve's election system this isn't currently the case; which gives a high risk for people poorly suited to the job imho.edit: thought of a potential sub-filter - if the forums actually had the \"rate this post\" system and you could chose to filter out low-rated posts, then there would be less voice for csm candidates who really weren't fit for purpose."
"forum bans have nothing to do with the above problem. forum bans are merely an indicator of the moderator's judgement at any point in time. they are mutually exclusive to the council and have no bearing on a council member's effectiveness.if you're looking for a measuring stick for council members, i'd posit one already exists with the checks of a 6 month term, ccp's ability to remove council members, and the council's desire to function internally against people if they so desire. every time it's come up it's been shot down either administratively by the target, or by the council when the target decided to feign good behavior.nothing in this proposal solves the problem that you've outlined above. this proposal merely gives the council a mechanism to alter the election results based on the judgement of the csm-proof moderation team.ultimately like it or not it's the people voting who decide the council's standards, not some silly \"elite\" class of people with their noses in the air. this is by design and as it should be. it's called \"democracy\". your personal standards for behavior don't matter a bit when contrasted with the voters.:edit: to answer your edit, i welcome a post rating system. we have one on gf.com and it works wonderfully."
"as long as you're just assigning shares totaling 100% to each of your characters on the account, this seems perfectly fine to me. it's not exploitable, given the demise of ghost training, and it's just an easy way of saving clicks when you want to train multiple characters on an account."
"ok, i see you understand what i am saying. you just said it all in one sentence...."
"why would they all have to add up to 100% instead of all training full speed?i don't go for this for the same reasoning that ccp is killing unsubbed training. unsubbed acct = no trainingsubbed acct = training for all characters i'm paying for."
"what about if there was a slight penalty for training on multiple accounts, say a -5% total for training 2 accounts, and -10% total for training 3 accounts, at the same time that is. so if you're training 2 accounts, one would be at 75%, the other at 20% etc. same with 3, main is at 50%, the 2 alts are at 20% each. if you only train 1 account you get the full 100%, but if you want the ease and convenience of training multiple accounts at the same time, you can do it, but there is a penalty."
"you do not have to answer this. just want you to think about it. do you currently have 3 toons on the same account that you actually use, or do you have a main, and maybe a toon, that you just pop onto once a month or less, where you might delete it and make a new toon?if you could train 3 chars all at full speed at the same time, everyone would have 3 character, just because they could train 3 chars at full speed at the same time.what i am proposing is not much different than now. it's still 100% total for the account, which is what we all pay for. it's just that i do not have to completely stop training on any char for a few hrs while i train something new on a toon."
"this method would penalize people for playing alts. alts are already near useless.you mentioned \"convenience of training multiple accounts at the same time\". the difference in my idea and the current way we are forced to train alts is that i can decide from the char select screen if i want one char to get 100% or two chars to get 50% each, and so on and so forth.i am suggesting neither a penalty nor an advantage for playing alts.i have played many games and eve is the one where you often say, \"why should i play an alt when my main has to completely stop training?\" i understand the present process because of how offline training works, where in other games, you can only train when you online, regardless if it is a main or a toon.i am just asking that since i do pay for an account (more than one actually) that allows training while offline, let me determine how that same rate of skill gain is dispersed to my toons. if it is too confusing for anyone, they can leave the slider set to the default 100% to only one character at a time."
"global criminal countdowns are too long, it's too much of a paint to deal with on low-sec roams. they should be reduced to 5 minutes to help encourage piracy."
"awesome idea, it is really a pain roaming with gcc."
"i concur."
"concur"
"i agree it is a pain, but im pretty sure thats the point. cripple the big bad ebil piates! (im a pirate) just make more ss, if anything the gcc should be used as a tactical limit, makes everyone into better bait!"
"increase to 30 minutes. honestly how lazy are these concord fellows if they give up after 15 minutes?on a side note...global criminal countdown is silly. no where in eve is there a global as in globe criminaluniversal doesnt seem to work neither; though maybe. could be universally recognized as a criminal."
"indeed"
"hell no. profanity needed to express hatred of idea. this is a horrible idea. the skills are ballanced and fair, and in all honesty, i like the fact that most noobs ***** and moan and leave because of the learning skills. eve is and always has been a place for determined, patient players. by removing the learning skills you would undermine the basis for eve's strong footing as the biggest (virtually) and baddest mmo on the planet. thats like making it so you can't kill players who are on trial, it defeats the damned purpose! don't edit the skills system. ever. *looks for negative support button*"
"opps, wrong button"
"to phrase it differently, i think all varieties of intel-gathering in this game need an overhaul, and it has to be done all at once instead of piecemeal. local chat is a terrible, terrible source of intel, but it has taken on great importance because there's really nothing better. local needs to go, but it needs to be replaced by a real method of gathering intel - the directional scanner and scan probes are great, but they're nowhere near enough for a full intel scheme. if we were to view this suggestion as an addition to the current system, i don't think i could support it - it's too much when added to what exists as-is. if viewed as part of the aforementioned overhaul, it sounds like a reasonable system, more so now that you've clarified what you mean. i'll give it a thumbs-up, but it's conditional on it being one part of a broader package of changes."
"congratulations about your carebear abilities. 6 months mining veldspar...wow!that's the last thing i would do in this game, but dude,if you had balls for mining 6 months in a row without shooting at yourself (apart the other stuff you mentioned) you're a ****ing winner"
"hyperbole and sarcasm. of course, i really have to wonder sometimes, with all the mining barges in empire..."
"qft"
"yeah, pity bomb launcher range is 15-20 km. :)"
"mob mentality = large groups of people with such massive amounts of influence by sheer numbers have the ability to effect/affect smaller groups of people via the threat or action of \"steam rolling\".smaller \"guys\" can't fight against such things without a great deal of suffering and loss.... few survive... even fewer remain.either they end up joining the \"mob\"... serving it... or leaving.that's why i said you shouldn't say \"not bob\" as its a personal attack imho.you could change that to \"not goon\" and it would still be the same message.but what you are referring too is the classic gaming syndrome with larger communities... the mob mentality.and since the super alliances that now exist number in the thousands... its pretty easy to push people around.fortunately the population of everyone else outnumbers them.... for now.i'm quite sure there are members/corps in these larger alliances that are not as bad as there reputation tends to indicate.... at the risk of stereotyping of course.so don't typecast the super alliance or a super alliance... give the impression your above prejudice and just indicating the tendencies that come with the territory of being that large."
".......meh. bob is probably flattered by the reference. or maybe they're screaming \"we've thinned down our numbers to only the very best and are now only about one thousand and that's mostly alts and after all we've accomplished this comparison is so unfair! nande yanen should be banned 4-ever!!!!!!!!!!!\".....which i highly doubtback to more relevant things, i'm still panning around ideas for integrating the whole planetary production chain with ccp's ideas for reworked industry and my idea for \"space bling.\"idea in short is to have meta items capable of being produced by smaller alliances with planetary resource income. meta items require minerals and progressively more \"mineral formations\" or whatever from the planetary side for higher meta levels. this way, as an alliances production capabilities get more and more uber, it ends up producing more and more luxurious goods.to isolate production from affecting empire, i was thinking that each item could have 1) the name changed to reflect the producing alliance (item is a dummy that references an existing meta item) 2) a stat that requires user to have same alliance ticker in order to be able to use...or something similar.same idea for the slightly better ship models. harbinger mk i, harbinger mk ii etc. these should have slightly buffed stats and ever so slightly buffed fitting. add an extra \"configuration\" slot that can be fed a special rig that can't be placed on other ships. (this is all ripped off the csm-cpp thread and slightly worked on by me btw) rig buffs the bonuses or maybe adds new bonuses etc.research facility + manufacturing plant (better names desired)requires intermediate sov and a decent sized investment. can be destroyed only if sov captured and can be captured instead. produces bpc's based on some metric i haven't decided yet. these get used together with the planetary resources to produce meta space bling and slightly better t1 ships etc.development institute + industrial complex (better names desired)requires capitol sov and a large investment. same destruction rules. produces higher level bpc's based on a similar undecided metric. used with planetary resources for faction-level space bling, maybe cross-faction-esque ships, and definitely for implants. has a hit-or-miss \"can you hq it?\" invention feel and requires lots of planetary income per item, but produces really uber stuff that is unique to the producing alliance.this provides a clear path to having the best shyt involving processes that use resources that are quite volatile at the initial production level but mostly useful at the \"i gots sov 4\" level. the intra-alliance consumption system would guarantee empire producers won't have the stuff being dumped on their markets. kinda draconian, but also kinda cool. interstellar alcohol conglomerate mega neutron blaster mkiv would be really awesome if these structures could be built with a modular design system such that one alliances prized assets are differentiated from other alliances assets. paths for upgrade as well.how does something like this sound?"
"point the first is already working but does not achieve the intended goal. pos are relatively cheap and you don't even need sov to put one on a dyspro moon. requiring infrastructure in order to reap the benefits or to make those benefits useful entrenches the existing alliances. it is just those benefits[money, ability to build super-caps] that keep 0.0 alliances so powerful compared to start ups.any effort to increase the value of 0.0 needs to come exclusively in the form of the general non-infrastructure related activities. 0.0 sov space needs to have much better asteroid fields and rats, to encourage people to come and kill them and mine them. new logistical structures that would be put in place need to have no tie to existing sovereignty mechanics. their value to those who are taking effective ratting, mining, and missioning area is in the power they afford the people who are trying to control the space in the first place, which makes them effective incentives to pvp.[as well on the other side]the only reason that dyspro moons do not fulfill this requirement is that dyspro is a corporation wide endeavor. this means that the individual pilots will unknowingly shy away from attacking and creating such infrastructure since they are unaware of the positive externalities[their corp having money externalizes benefits onto its members], and even if they are aware may not act anyway. as well, the difficulty in taking down said resource is too effective a barrier to entry if we want more competition for 0.0 resources.compromise point the second will not work. it is impossible to remove blobbing by enforcing simultaneous combat. multi-grid solutions are possible, but multi-grid solutions still must resolve around a single contention point or fail in that one side can blob and win and the other has no such option.the only way i can see that working is by letting dreadnoughts target stationary objects from off grid via a target painter and allow pos guns the same luxury[while severely limiting their on grid effectiveness against smaller ships]. though this produces other problems. compromise point 3 is futile. while wealth is not a zero sum game, player participation is a zero sum game(more or less). if you want more people to come to 0.0 they will need to come from somewhere. this somewhere will be high-sec, since there are even fewer people in low-sec than null-sec. empire is already where the majority of pvp good production is handled[since there is no risk of losing access to a t2 bpo in a station and there is ample supply of invention goods], with low-sec handling the majority of non-super capital capital production."
"i'm aiming for something much more granular and straightforward. say 25m to throw it up. add water. reap income. sub-cap gang can knock it out in a day. that's volatility that small alliances will benefit from as they can live under the radar and rapidly regain their territory if wiped. kind of \"capture the flag\" but it's only one part of a two-part compromise.exactly. part two is to elevate stable alliances to an extent above the circus that will become resource production with fast turnover at the subcap level. this is why i called this thing a compromise. it benefits the large and the small and enriches their means of interaction.raising income through ratting and mining just means more ratting and mining. that's not a game to me. skill training is automated for a reason. i'm in favor of moving 0.0 income to a more passive system as well, where your successes in pvp and war industry affect your ability to field passive income generators.we already hit that pony until it was blue in the face. check out fahtim's thread. there's even a q&a by toman addressing your concerns. easy to find in the second assembly thread i believe.point 3 exists because with all this passive income flying around, some empire players might wonder if empire will just become a huge joke compared to the bling of 0.0. in a way, that's what i hope happens, but more in the sense of 0.0 being a different ballgame altogether."
"how long does it take to take 25m. any effort to induce players to move en-masse into 0.0 cannot have an infrastructure component. even mining has a problem they have large infrastructure components[logistics].you need to encourage people to go there and stay there for the duration, then you need to encourage them to come back. the barrier to entry needs to be more or less nil, only the cost of the ships you are flying. otherwise you are not going to create any significant pressure on 0.0 entities. [or there will not be a limited amount of resources to go around, which means less pvp, rather than more].0.0 space is a zero sum game. two entities do not co-exist. there is a limited amount of resources and as one side gobbles it up, the other side necessarily loses. if you are inducing small alliances to push into sovereign space then you are necessarily reducing the power of large alliances.there is nothing wrong with reducing the power of large alliances, but you cannot possibly do both at the same time. they are mutually exclusive. that is exactly what we have and its not working. its not working because large alliances have huge efficiency gains as they grow when it comes to putting up, taking down, and protecting passive income generators. they have to do less work per person than a small alliance has to in protecting limited resources. link? i recall reading it, but i also recall it failing to properly address the problem.point 3 exists yes, but its not compatible with the other stated goals. these positions are mutually exclusive, and any \"compromise\" is going to compromise on just how much participation you want to drain from empire and just how much power you want to remove from existing alliances. any solution that fails to acknowledge that fact will fail, because its goals will be impossible."
"assembly thread toman's version of the proposal with his q&a included. at the time, 0.0 threads were the redheaded stepchild sextuplets of the assembly hall and nobody wanted to raise any more of them. not sure about some of your points, but keep working on it so at least the language of this compromise can be adjusted to get the message across clearly.nobody's talking about increasing the player base in the game. what is being talked about is 1) not making the game a joke for the 50% or so of players who never leave hisec (who probably will to an extent if 0.0 is buffed) 2) not making empire such a joke that anyone who can't leave immediately (new players) needs to quit the game.i understand what you're saying about the zero-sum game, but large alliances can't play whack-a-mole across the entire galaxy every time someone trashes one of their production units and sets up shop. the inevitable result of a high volatility asset is that those with the most consistent presence will dominate the activity regardless of the tides the flow over them.before i answer about the 25m, i'm envisioning that they make the equivalent wealth of 250m by the end of the week. does that change the nature of your question? is free a bad thing? i'm all for free.25m could be too large or too small in some eyes. being taken down in a day (reinforced mechanic, but no stront) by a handful of rr battleships may be seen as too fast or too slow by some. without a doubt though, it sits far below the pos level of volatility and will create the whack-a-mole environment that large alliances will have to ignore at some point. they can participate where it makes sense, but will inevitably seek to consolidate their territories to what they can keep in easy reach. for the volatile part of this compromise, that's what's desired.on the high end with the production systems requiring various levels of sov and having capitol benefits etc, stable alliances with the muscle to play on that field will have the upper hand. while nobody is blocking small alliances from getting the proper sov and setting up their own systems, the reality is that they will suffer from sov volatility at the hands of larger powers and have to resort to their advantages at the whack-a-mole scale.the zero-sum will be made more of a mutual relationship by the reality of supply and consumption capability of the new resources. for instance, sub-t2 meta level items can be produced by small alliances using mostly minerals and a little bit of the new \"mineral formations\" from planetary sources; higher level meta and beyond can be produced by large alliances who can invent the bpc's at their facilities, but these items require an **** ton of the planetary resources. result is that the large alliances are trying to offload minerals and the small alliances are trying to offload mineral formations. that's a self-contained economy that plays out entirely outside of empire.in a nutshell, there should be new assets for all. some new assets will cater to large alliances. some will cater to smaller alliances and corps or even individuals. the mutual relationship via production and realities of the types of volatility that large and small alliances can handle will ultimately keep them in healthy symbioses.that make more sense? keep posting. i'll work on the language at some point."
"toman's version is ****ty and falls into all the same traps as every other \"decentralized\" solution. he makes no mention of the obvious defensive strategies and \"one sides\" lag.[he assumes that one side will have problems because of lag and the other will not, specifically that the small gang lags less than the big gang when the big gang comes to knock the small gangs **** in]. the obvious defensive strategy, since the attackers need their dreads on the field is t blob the freaking dreads while they can't shoot the planet.this obsoletes all the other fights until the main fight is over since one side cannot hope to win the cap fight when their sub-caps are off spending 20 minutes killing the pds's.and neither am i talking about \"increasing the player base\".look, assuming that the player base does not increase, the number of players getting a use out of space will always total the number of players. if we induce more people to leave high-sec for 0.0 then high-sec suffers[since its the proximity to markets and missions that gives the space its value anyway].there is no way around this, if you make 0.0 better in order to draw people out, you cannot keep high-sec \"the same\". it will change, new hubs will be created.no, see, that is exactly what they can do, and its even easier for them to actively defend production with less people due to the way that systems are aligned.high volatility is good, its exactly what you need, but that is not what you are proposing. the barriers to entry reduce its volatility. the logistics reduce its volatility. this means of production needs to be solely based on the activities of players. in short, you want a resource that gives you money when you are there and doesn't at all, period, when you are not. no reinforcement, no 10 minutes of an rr battleship. if the enemy shows up, its production is toast until the enemy leaves. a simple reseeding of belts in 0.0 to double or triple their size and/or value as well as keeping their spawn rate constant would do this. 250m/week is simply not enough to justify consistent presence. and without consistent presence you are back to the large alliance problem. they will dominate that game just as they dominate the pos game.i mean, ****, how long did gs keep those dyspro moons in the north while fighting a full on pos war in geminate? now, while this isn't likely to happen on such a scale, its going to happen.there is no such thing as an organic small alliance boost. there are only boosts to established entities or upstart entities. more coming"
"it makes sense, its just intellectually bankrupt. you cannot change the 0.0 sov mechanics without impacting the status quo. you should not even be trying.the question is instead, what about the status quo is bad, why is it bad, how do you change it?well, aside from specific balance points, the complaints from the large alliances are threefold.1. shooting pos is boring. its boring because there aren't any people around and there are a **** tonne of pos to shoot.2. lag3. small gangs have nothing to do.____________the complaints, aside from specific balance points, from the small alliances are fourfold.1. shooting pos is boring2. lag3. small gangs have nothing to do4. holy **** we're going to get crushed_________________you can do something to fix number 1 and 2 and 3. number 4 is impossible. but we will talk about that in a bit more depth later.fixing number one is easy, reduce the number of structures that are necessary to destroy in order to flip sov. from a game standpoint it doesn't matter what the structures are and where the structures are so long as they are limited and don't interfere with other mechanics of producing sov. you can also make them easier to destroy, easier to fuel, etc etc etc.moons are, actually a good place to put these structures. stations already go on planets and we have a bunch of moons around to use. stars are the other point, but it might not be that a central sovereignty point is what people want to focus on.here is a way that you can reduce the number of pos simply and speedily. and while it ain't perfect, its better than moving it to planets.alright, so we reduce the number of pos and make their defenses weaker. now we have to do something about lag.lag is the tough one. because you are dealing with a central point of contention. and, in order to really effectively have a fight, you need to have a central point of contention. spreading them out creates blobs at one side or the other.one way of spreading the fight out would be to have one fight spread across two grids. the fight is threefold. 1. defending your grid. 2. finding the enemies grid, 3 attacking the enemies grid. blobbing any one grid will leave you unable to damage the enemies important infrastructure. if you can't damage the enemies important infrastructure they are just going to keep beating on you until you die.i.e. lets take small, cheap friendly ships, give them a target painter s that only work on modules, capitals, and pos structures. then we let any dread within 1au shoot the target of that target painter. if one side doesn't go after the others dreads, then its a race to kill the painters [which will be carried to the front lines en-masse by carriers just as they now provide frigates], before the enemies destroy a target. and such, the side that is not doing offense looses. if both sides are doing only offense then at least we have two fleets in two areas. we have successfully split the fight for a single point[the pos] into two points[the pos, the enemy dreads] and maybe even three points[the pos, the aggressor dreads, and the defender dreads]point three is the hardest. letting small gangs be good at sov warfare means that large gangs gangs will be even better. such, small gangs need to have efficiency gains built in some place. there are a number of problems with this that mainly rely on the eve system architecture. you see, systems in eve are mainly arranged in pipes. this means that a number of attacks on various structures doesn't gain much over a single force attacking one and then going down the line.more to be continued"
"a pos requires a capital attack and nobody wanted to invest in an assault on gs at the time, especially when they likely had no capability to hold the assets or defend anything they put in place. it's that simple. on the flip side, if it were possible to cut the legs out from under gs with sub-cap gangs, gs would have seen a much higher loss in domestic production on the home front. hell, that's where i would have been. that's what i mean by high volatility.i went exploring all over gs and found the same things over and over. a few people in a station system here. a paladin hitting the station as soon as i hit local there. nothing really to defend. gs's home front was not as exposed as you would think. there was nothing to rally a sub-cap gang to go hit. i faced greater risks from gatecamps set up by other alliances and corps at regional choke points. in a high volatility environment, those gatecamps would have been instead attacking gs assets.i hope highsec does recede a bit because of the exodus of players with the skills to get involved in the skirmishes over planetary income. by isolating the source and sink of the added production to a 0.0 phenomenon, empire won't turn into a slum for the players who start out there/choose to stay there. the entire t2 production stream will still be in place, and that leaves a lot of activity and opportunity for trade, which is all that empire needs to preserve its place. the missions are still there. the mining is still there. the low-risk income for start ups is still there. the lack of exposure to the 0.0 alliances via pvp is still there. this is what i mean by preserving the place of empire.not seeing the advantage you're getting at. while gs can wipe most alliance's best fleets by getting their numbers together, can they do it in every system where every upstart 0.0 tycoon chooses to attack them? can they do it against every raid from every other neighboring alliance? if the income lost to gs and gained by the raiders were large and required an expendable investment, would an alliance like gs feel much more hurt at the level of this mechanism when they were away from home? i believe the answer is yes and that gs leadership would opt to rein in their assets to what they found essential and what would net them a gain as far as the required presence to maintain the asset.gs can't fly across the galaxy to meet every gang that rears its head. sure they can win here and there and by great margins, but can they do it everywhere at a minutes notice? sure they can make a tour of an entire region and incap everyone's income generators with minimal losses, but can they hold anything like that? i believe the answer is no and that alliances like gs will quickly realize that while the rewards are high, the player load is simply too high to have to repeatedly make these attacks over and over again.maybe localized gs cells would be able to fight this mechanic to an extent, but this splits up gs's numbers and makes them progressively more vulnerable to any other alliances best fleets, and this nullifies their initial advantage of size.sub-cap vulnerable, low hp, and cheap would present the most challenging environment gs's of 0.0 can ever face."
"the only way to make said attacks do that[and this is the only way to effect an organic way to make small gangs useful, which is to make the efficiency gain in adding another ship to the existing fleet lower than that of having that ship go off and do something on its own, which occurs mainly in the time cost of travel] is to vastly reduce the ability of pos's to defend strategic pos modules[bridges, generators, maybe jammers, but probably not]. as an aside you would then git rid of fueling as well. the idea that logistics would be getting the stuff up and protecting it since it was easy to destroy. like a 5-10 man cruiser gang could do it easily in a few minutes. give them the properties of a repping bs. once the repair rate is sufficiently broken the gain in efficiency in killing the target becomes linear rather than exponential.[repair is unnecessary, flat hit points could also work]. if you make the strategic pos module effect sufficiently time sensitive[a broken jump bridge doesn't matter if its up when the enemy jumps trough], easy to replace and easy to destroy then attacking them for the heck of it isn't very valuable. but during a sov contest, sending forces to destroy those structures that aid in the enemy bringing ships to the front[and then camping the pipes] and ensuring that they stay down becomes a valid option. as well as if course, dedicating forces to ensuring that the structures stay operational. then you have a balancing act regarding ensuring that you can reinforce the fight, that your enemy cannot and the fight itself. as always, the sole determiner of the outcome of sovereignty has to be fight over the single point. but you can extract efficiency gains by running interference on both sides if the structures that allow that to happen are sufficiently volatile. 4 is something you just cannot fix. though you can make it easier. the reason you cannot fix 4 is because not only is \"more people > less people\" good for the game[since it encourages newbees to participate in the fight, and keeps the hegemony of the rich and old from turning the game into a ****ty wow clone], but because more people always means advantages in a cooperative game. the only way that you can reduce the strength of established alliances is to increase the number of small alliances and individuals. when there are a small number of players, the power of the large established block can easy cajole the others into working for their own ends.e.g. lets take a three person game where the winner is the one that wins a fight between the three relatively equal people. there are no rules, what is the optimal strategy?a: form an alliance with either as quickly as possible then beat up the odd man out. then after they are gone, try beat up the other guy. your chances of winning went from 1/3 to 1/2. sometimes, people kinda kike the guy they teamed up with to beat up on the odd man out and they form a more lasting bond. this is how corporations, alliances, and power blocks are formed.[again, remember, no rules]. if you want to shake up 0.0 you will have to encourage the formation of new power blocks, that means you have to give small individual entities a reason to go to 0.0 space and hope they don't ally themselves with the current space holders. [either way you have increased density]. the last time this happened was when new space was introduced into the game. since its unlikely we will be getting new space every expansion, its much better to slant 0.0 income towards active players to draw people out of low-sec and empire with the promise of rewards that they don't need infrastructure to get at.only a little more coming"
"now, of course, this doesn't cover the specific balance problems of fueling[seriously a boring stupid mechanic which only serves to exacerbate the feeling that pos need to be hard to kill, if no one is coming around to fuel it, they aren't going to be able to defend it if you come to knock the thing down], titans[actually all large aoe's since they break the entire idea of efficiency loss from focus fire], and capitals[oh hey, why even bother having battleships when you've got 60 carriers?]"
"actually they did bring caps on a number of occasions. it has nothing to do with whether or not they brought caps and everything to do with the fact that reinforcement timers let is get back and defend when necessary and that we didn't need to be there in order to make money.because there is more to power than the forces on the field at the moment."
"this is exactly what we were going after in fahtim's thread. by all means, create the perfect solution. i think we were pretty close and at the very least in the right direction.i'll posit that 1. exists primarily because of 4. and the subsequent lack of any clear avenues to fight. once it's over, it's pretty much over.3. can be fixed by more mobility requisites (via multigrid solution) and with a sub-cap volatile asset below the pos or sov conflict scale.the mechanic you proposed with the target painter is quite similar to having simultaneous points of contention in that the speed and support will determine who gets to use their dreads and who gets trapped out in dead space where the action isn't going on.while the vulnerabilities created by a multi-grid solution will create avenues for a defender to blob the detachments from the main force, is this not the desired solution to 1. where nobody shows up because they're afraid of 4?have a feeling we're very, very close to a damned near perfect implementation."
"again, pos's lack of volatility is what lets this work. shorter reinforcement timers (maybe 12h) and less hp/firepower would have turned those into gs loss of income."
"i assume you're talking about gs's ability to project sov and the threat of wiping another alliances sov? if gs had to worry about the subsequent full out assault on their planetary income out in the boonies, if gs faced the fact that the defenders would just come back the next day and re-whack the mole, this projection of power would lose influence. gs could come tear down all of the towers or planetary defense stations or whatever, and all that would happen is the defenders would give gs the runaround and go hit a bunch of their planetary income points...or if the multi-grid solution works out well enough, they might stick around and try to pick off sub-cap detachments of gs."
"no, i am not. i am talking about how a perfect defense is never tested.also, i just got to the point where kelsin wrote the proposal. no wonder..."
"think you're getting a little ahead of yourself, kanyenah, we pretty much abandoned anything with the toxic \"small gang\" phrase and just went for a more balanced sov tool. most of the input on that thing came from fahtim and i. toman wrote the q&a on his own. ...did i link the right thread?"
"@ op in response to my responsemy best friend told me that diplomacy consists of 90% bs and 10% fact.its a necessary evil... and honestly... it makes things go smoothly.but oh well.^_^;;;and personally.. i've learned the hard way... not all people are tot"
"yes you linked the right thread. yes, kelsin still wrote it.no i am not getting ahead of myself, you are not understanding what was said. its educational. first understand why the statement is true and you will understand where your understanding failed."
"no. there must always be one objective. not one objective after other sequential objectives. just one objective. nearly all other solutions result in consolidating forces being the best option[the only way to make consolidation not optimal is by splitting the battlefields so far its near impossible to travel between them, and that presents many many more problems.]nope. 4 primarily exists because its impossible for iraq to assault the united states of america. some organizations are just bigger and badder than others. this is a natural progression in semi-cooperative games. there is no getting around it, you're gonna get crushed. if you set it up so that they could \"not get crushed\" then you're still gonna get crushed, except instead of being crushed by someone because they had more guys its going to be because they had more money or were playing the game longer.blobbing is much certainly the lesser of the three evils."
"that sums up exactly where we were going with requiring simultaneous points of contention. i read your proposed strategy for why the attackers would always fail against such a structure, and the thing is, there are a hundred fc's who would find ways to counter your defense and a hundred more to find counters for those attacks, which can only point to effectiveness of the solution.gs isn't perfect. no defense is perfect. players aren't online 23/7 (though some kia in tde may beg to differ regarding my current activities...) perfect offense isn't perfect defense. you can't win them all. you can't be everywhere at the same time. some attackers have nothing to lose. the laws of entropy will take over.you need to elaborate and not because i'm misreading what you're saying. come out from behind the magic curtain and we'll talk about it :-)4 exists because i don't send my three dreads after your ten dreads without a damned perfect strategy and intel. that's not so much a law of the game as it is a symptom of the failings of the pos as a sov tool. one of the goals of the sov instrument we came up with was to have limited victories and defeats at the satellite structures instead of binary victory or loss when fighting asymmetric sov battles."
"uhh, so you're saying that you want the \"pds\" 3-5 systems away from each other? cause otherwise, no, you're not. or you're foolish in thinking that the nodes will be defendable. a defense does not need to be perfect to be successful. a perfect defense is never tested. defenses are only tested when there is a question to their success. there is no question to the success of said operations. success is determined on an individual basis, the possible actions of third parties take little part. such, they do not occur. it is only a matter of scale that prevents gs's space being taken by a coalition of alliances[and the alliances we make], the same efficiency advantages that protect large alliances with hard to destroy assets protect them with easy to destroy assets. in order to reduce the power of the entrenched alliances you need to increase the number of players, diluting the power of the larger groups. you will not do what with mechanics that retain the entrenched alliances advantages, you need to wholly remove said incentive from that cooperative structure.impossible, rookie ships will blow up the node before they can make an impact"
"no, it is very much a law of games."
"myth propagated only within gs. persians and greeks. hannibal vs romans. etc etc. gs members seem to like using luke skywalker analogy to poke fun at such concepts as tactical victory over superior forces.truth is that the tactics in eve are washed out by the pos, not because players wouldn't be smart enough to use them otherwise. go fly losec enough and you'll see the difference."
"tactics only matter when one sides is better than the others. but balance must be done for optimal tactics. people with bad tactics will lose no matter the balance.that more people beat less people is a law of these semi-cooperative games. it is inviolate.some people in gs laugh about luke skywalker not because they are poking fun at tactical victory over superior forces. but because people always think they are luke skywalker. they think they have more \"skills\". but in eve, skills are normalized, there are no jedi. and while they are variations of the tactical and strategic acumen of humans, those people with more tactical or strategic acumen realize that the guy with more guns is probably going to win.i suppose you might not believe me, but then again, most people don't have tactical or strategic acumen, have never read the works of anyone who has or had tactical or strategic acumen and have never studied games, politics, economics, or war.as for it being a myth. no, its not. eve is a non-cooperative asymmetrical game, but sovereignty is a zero sum semi-cooperative game[or hybrid game, and combat is a nash game, which is why sov is semi-cooperative/hybrid]. and that means that bigger is better, always and forever."
"gs pop culture and nothing more =pwhile it is true that all tactics available and all ships available are available to all, and that this would \"normalize\" all skills within the balance of the game, large alliances are generally pulling out the right tactic for the most important job they have at hand, and this should always leaves them open to the use of the right counter-tactic.a losec or empire 0.0 harasser can choose what exposure they have. gs can't stop being gs.this mechanic is slowed down not by \"normalized skills\" or optimal tactics or more is better, but because the pos kills entropy and tells us what to bring and where to bring it. it is this fight broker that is screwing up entropy.only gs espouses the notion that the situation that is arises because of fundamental laws of semi-coop games. it's blatant circular logic. change the game mechanics, and a new fundamental law will be observed. it's not fundamental, but situation specific, and entirely driven by stront timers and the low volatility of the pos in this case."
"if by \"only goonswarm\" you mean \"the last 100 years of economic, political, and strategic thought\"the u.s. army sop doesn't say \"don't engage unless you have a 9 to 1 advantage\" for no reason.in a world where one side has perfect information, the other side does not, and the side that has perfect information is the side with less resources to allocate to information gathering, and any of that matters because overwhelming force is not applied.let me explain this to you in the simplest way possible. \"overwhelming force\" is the one tactic with no counter-tactic. this will always be true. bigger will always be better. you cannot change that, even if you try. you keep using that word, i do not think it means what you think it means.you have no clue what you are talking about. you want to remove free association from eve? that is the only way to \"change the system\". that is what a semi-cooperative game means, its a game where there is some order of player cooperation and those entities compete with other entities composed of player cooperation. remove and/or change stront timers and all you will do is make it easier for gs to attack multiple systems at once. it make it easier for others to attack us as well. but that is all that a change in stront timing will do, a shift in the value of strategies."
"the problem is you've gone and quoted a large body of academic knowledge regarding zero-sum games and all of the meticulously proven behavior regarding those games, but eve isn't a zero-sum game. ccp adds things. ccp takes things. furthermore there's not unanimous agreement over the proper treatment of opportunities as opposed to resources with regard to how you can model the thing.in addition all of the theory surrounding player behavior has been proven bad over and over. how good was it for lotka vitra to \"discover\" focus fire.bigger hasn't always been better either. i think smash + rk might have actually been bigger in terms of sheer numbers. we all know how that ended. without even mentioning the older bob or ..asvn or whatever the hell they were called.the theory for well described systems has been fleshed out and is good at describing things that are well classified, but eve isn't going to classify well and trying to apply game theory without proving that eve fits the classifications for which those proofs hold true is going to get you nowhere.so no, don't pull out some damned academia stick at us all as if the underlying assumptions have been met.i have better marks in organic chem than any doctor who will be opening up your chest someday. i know what the entropy is"
"this has got to be the most civil argument in the history of the eve online forums.i found it quite entertaining to read.: o )oh and please keep it coming guys.its a nice change... keeps me thinking..."
"power is a zero-sum game. wealth is not. you can make players more wealthy, but at the end of the day, the part that matters in terms of sov, that is zero-sum.edit: also, there is no discussions about behavior there, only about optimization. balancing a game needs to be about what is optimal not what people might do[as people will do all sorts of sub-optimal things, and keeping those who do the optimal things from becoming a hegemony is important]. in this particular instance we have the optimal thing and the behavioral thing coinciding but that does not necessarily need to be the case in order to make these determinations.1. what?2. lv failing had nothing to do with \"discovering\" focus fire.bigger is always better that does not mean other things are not also better. all it means is that bigger is always better. heh, apparently not. no, eve is going to classify pretty easily. since it fits the models for pretty much all international relations discussions since well, forever. its the basic formation of societies and their interactions amongst one another. [as well as most economic thought regarding monopolies and other coordinated actions]bigger is better. you can do nothing about it. you can only try and influence individuals to form more coalitions and hope the older ones fall apart."
"i'll take your word for it then"
"hi ccp, since the \"ghost training\" change is bad for many people in other ways than just eliminating people cutting in and out of subscriptions, you could give us something to sweeten the pot in the training area: allow us to switch skills by logging on to our character's account on the eve-online website.because so far, if you went traveling, you wouldn't be able to switch skills on your journey, cause you can't start up the game client in some internet cafe in india or wherever else.so the obvious reaction to that would be to let the account expire, since you're getting no benefit once the training runs out.being able to change your training through the website would be great... i'd like it even better if i could change training from my cell phone (myself? i always keep my main active, but i do suspend alts, especially cause eve is often just not interesting enough to play it without taking repeated 6 months breaks. here's hoping the new performance changes will make large territorial fleet battles a little more fun)"
"that's all good and fine... but what of the macro-skill training exploit potential?it's better if you implement a skill training queue."
"does it make me a criminal to be a proponent of exploiting the game via skill-training macros?hell, i would support online skill training because it would result in a firefox plugin to get around this awful ccp imposed draconian ....law.going to go eat some pizza. sick of skill training discussion already. ccp, give us a skill cache or something. of all things in this game, i want a skill training cache.okay, you could give me 1000bn isk, but i would still be almost as happy with a skill training cache."
"think about it this way.you got a guy that pays for said account.... whom also has a isk farming account.... and all he does is use macro's to train all of these accounts and then turns around and sells them for money on ebay or something.thats what i was referring to."
"like the idea, no, i really do, although it is a bit weak reallyhow about a mod requiring sov 1 that makes all ships belonging to the sov holder invulnerable and makes all other ships explode when they enter the system? now that could provide a much required buff to sov holding blobbers"
"don't know if this is the right place to post this but i couldn't find one specific to this, so if it's in the wrong place then i apologise.so the time code debacle goes on with today someone putting up a wts order for 999mil isk for 60days. yes, you read that right, 999,000,000isk. he justified it by saying there is going to be a shortage and he is just jumping in there first.this begs the question of why is there a shortage in the first place - the removal of the buddy program i think he said. unannounced by ccp (he mentioned two days notice - which for people who don't frequent the forums is no notice).my view on this is that eve made a major wrong move when they got rid of the 30 day and 90 day time codes. 30 days time codes used to sell in their hundreds every day on the bazaar. 90 days time codes used to sell in their hundreds as well.ccp made a lot of money this way, but they wanted to bump their prices up and they tried to hide it behind \"streamlining\". well, anyone with a calculator could see that it was a price increase on the time codes despite what ccp wanted to call it. they basically tried to hide the fact that it was going up in price. why? what is the sense in that? did ccp not trust their game was good enough and people would leave in their droves because they said they were putting their prices up?at $34.99 for 60 days this game is still remarkably cheap compared to other mmos. so why did ccp try to go about it a clandestine manner?anyway, back to the time codes. people need choices. those of us who don't have credit cards, or use debit cards, or have bank accounts (yes, there are still people who do not use these things believe it or not), buying time codes with isk earned in the game is now my only option, but i cannot afford to pay out 550mil isk for a time code. i would have no money left to buy stuff in the game, and the game would cease to be a game anymore if i have to spend all my time earning isk in game to pay these huge prices for a time code.also, with the prices of time codes going up all the time, it means people are getting more and more isk from selling them, and surely that will have an effect on the economy in the game. in real life, when economies are flooded with cash inflation spirals to higher and higher levels.ccp do the qen to tell us about this and how this game is being used as a model economy in studys by real economists. what do they think of this influx of isk?all in all it seems a very bad idea by ccp to leave us with no options to pay for the game. the greedy will only ask more and more isk for their time codes, and the part time players will dispappear if they can't afford the new prices. me included. ccp have literally priced me out of the game with what they have done, and i am sure i am not alone.my son currently needs a time code for his character as his account has now expired. i can only afford 475mil isk to buy one but my wtb posts are simply ignored on the forums and now he has no game to play. i will probably be following shortly....but, what do you think?"
"yes but will we see account numbers drop.people using less accounts means less foreign currency."
"will mommy and daddy still pay for juniors account, when the bills mount up.can the multi account man afford all his accounts, when redundancy looms.are we moving towards single account players?i already know of players who have left, because of money worries"
"if you look at the demographics of eve i would highly doubt its the kind of folks that are getting hit hard by the \"credit crunch\"some people will always leave, but thats always true"

"there was open dialogue. we were fully allowed to discuss it directly. but obviously there was no reason for it, due to the actual response. ccp is well aware that this is on the top of our wishlist, but we can't tie ccp's hands behind it's back and force them to do it either.i'm sorry we couldn't do more than this. sadly, i think it's a matter of bad expectations."

"this has been around for far to long, as is supported by their own documentation.this is a bad idea, and even as someone who has never ghost trained, this is a notch down on the customer service scale imho."
"can i say i've never taken advantage of the \"ghost training\" bug? no.can i say i agree with the way they suddenly banned \"ghost training\"? no.can i say i'm upset with the \"ghost training\" thing being stopped? no.i know some skills take forever and a day to train, and i've felt that sting (bs 5 anybody?), but i think ccp was well in their right to stop the process. for too long, people have been 'playing without paying' both in rp, sp, market orders, etc. it's about time ccp stopped the process and let the game be truly player driven, instead of inactive account driven.the long-term effects are that some vets will stop playing, which is neither good nor bad, and that less capital ships will be fielded, which is good honestly. i do wish they'd stop all gain from inactive accounts, and implement the skill queue, but one step at a time.i cannot support this thread, as this is ccp's game, and we just play to share in their virtual world and maybe even change it a bit. kudos, ccp."

"1)eve actively kept ghost training in. clearly it was not a bug.2)unlike other mmorpgs eve does not reward you with how much you play, it rewards you with how long your sub is. in wow someone can go exp mad and reach end content in a few months, whereas in eve it will take a good year to be good in a ship, not great in it. you pay to train when you buy a sub, ghost training only seems fair as eve slows you down by a hell of a lot compared to other mmorpgs. basically, to be good in eve you have to pay around $500 under the new change, which is a f**king rip off and blatantly nothing other than a grab for money."

"this is the worst most appalling and ghastly idea i have seen ccp implement so abruptly in the time i have spent with this game.there is no justifiable reason to implement this idea now. for ccp to cover it up with the rouge that ghost training is an exploit is an insult. ghost training has been and advertised feature, which has been a deciding factor for many to subscribe to an account. i am simply not interested in the explanation that it was an unintentional bug, which has been used by players. this feature, which ccp has advertised, has been used for 5 years now and it is deplorable to suddenly withdraw it with virtually no warning.we will see whether ccp have made a bad move by noting the active subscriptions over the forthcoming months."

"voting no against the nano nerf. terrible idea. too heavy handed.approach it differently. removing a style of play instead of finding ideas and new roles (new ships) to counter blobs as well as nanos is more interesting and creative. again so far i see this as another bad idea from the devs. you guys need some civil or mechanical engineers on that dev squad i swear. 69 pages of no votes against 32 votes for the nerf. yikes 2:1. time to listen this time. already accounts closing due to the gtc ( not whining just the truth) and now this? where is a shark when when have the fonz all ready for it.brka brka brka"
"obvious a lot of goons used this inactive feature... so i propose ccp goes thru with the change. maybe some goons will leave... yay!"
"if you dont pay you should get nothing."
"this just in: ccp apparently run by the director of kaup<U+FFFD>ing banki."
"i agree with all 'inactive gain' parts. stop market orders, stop rp gain, stop skill training.gtcs should still be used to reactivate an account, and corporations should still be active if they have some paying members. players should have their characters dropped if the following three conditions apply:- they've been inactive for six or more months- they have less than 2m sp- they have not paid their account for six months.given these conditions, i'm willing to bet that a great deal of player and corp names will suddenly become available as the older characters that were started in a trial or such are suddenly dropped.this move will clear up the database and give freedoms back to the players (name selection, etc). i support this topic, even if it was sarcasm."
"lets run the game into the ground. signed/ i support killing eve."
"supported fairs fair tbh i have never used this feature erm sry bug but i think ghost training can go both ways tbh really unless you have crap stats eventually you will have to pay up to keep training so honestly i don't care either way but....as it has been pointed out yes rp and isk gain should be disabled aswellprops for pointing this out op"
"agree."
"dont forget about jobs in npc stations, like material research and selling bpos with high me for profit."
"why not delete all those trial accounts, people who have not paid a penny to ccp"
"yes, remove the real issues, or none at all.ghost training should stay!"
"agreed.progress on skills, rp, market, manufacturing, research, ect... should all halt on unpaid accounts. corporation title positions, however, should be maintained.how to deal with pos run by a single 'ghost' account that lacks any other corporate members to maintain it however? does it continue to consume fuel until it runs out? should it go offline immediately?"
"guess i did forget to \"support\" my own thread. hehe beside its got buried in the ghost training complaints fallout"
"fully supported!"
":speednerf:"
"during our meetings with ccp on sunday, ccp raised the question if we wanted another alliance tournament. if yes, they would let the important people in ccp know that this was our wish. of course they couldn't promise anything, but they could at least let them know.the mesasge from the csm this case was a big yes. however, i think it would be nice if we maybe could prove to ccp that this is something that everybody wants.so guys, show your support for or against another alliance tournament. post right here.and remember to press \"support this topic\" right under here ;)"
"full support."
"supported."
"yes, but no rewards/prizes. bragging rights only from here on out."
"good stuff."
"yes.as long as it has pig cam intermissions"
"tournaments have been awesome!"
"yay"
"its one of the things that makes eve so much better than any other online game, definitely yes!"
"very yes."
"+1!"
"absolutely, tis an amazing thing and makes eve stand out even more from other worlds."
"do miss tom/spiral want back!"
"i fully endorse this product and/or service."
"last time we had v without his pants, how can you not support?"
"i and all my alts support this initiative. we watched every match of the last couple tournaments together."
"yes."
"haihaai. supported."
"sounds like a good idea"
"yes, why would anyone be against it???"
"support button. let me show you it"
"it's a fun event to watch!"
"not sure why they need to ask"
"i've always wanted to watch another circlejerk"
"the army of me supports this, but i'm too lazy to support with them all."
"yeah was something the whole eve community got behind and loved. seems odd that they would even question it to be honest."
"yeah, bring um back - they make good watching :)"
"and yet you didn't click the support button!"
"i didn't know they ever disappeared. giev plz!"
"it has my support in principle, but i am not giving it a thumbs up. i would say seeing eve tv return is a far higher priority than the alliance tournaments."
"yes. brings it back"
"erm yes? of course we want more tourniments."
"supported"
"i want to watch more of these... kinda want evetv back too, but that's not what this thread is about."
"supported"
"or at least no prizes with redeemable isk value."
"yup, they're great television. no more state issue ships, though - the universal standings rewards were nice, and the lp wasn't bad, but giving bob 300 billion worth of unique ships was a bit much. as an alternative prize, replace every ship and module lost by anybody...and give them all to the winning team. it makes the whole thing not affect the economy at all, but still provides a huge incentive to win."
"supported in full, they're fun to watch and are one of the reasons eve stands out over so many other mmorpgs"
"yes, but we still get to reserve the right to ***** about the rules, officiating and still get to tell the commentators that they are noobs.ahhh, such fun stuff, i love the alliance tournies."
"terrible idea.on the other hand, they really need to add skill queue system now that ghost training will get disabled."
"i'm all for the removal of learning implants and some learning skills; they're a real barrier to new players and hold people back from pvp from the fear of podding but the training times as they stand are about right really. a reduction of 50% would make it far too quick to train into roles people have spent a long time training."
"so more targets to shoot at ?personally i feel that the training times are a bit long. bearable as they are now, but having them shorter would be helpful."
"right. and what about the people that have been here 3 or 4 or 5 years already and have tens of millions of skill points? are you going to reimburse them 30 million skill points that they can then effectively double their already insane amount of skills? this will do nothing but keep you at the bottom of the proverbial \"social skill hierarchy\" because they will still be so far ahead of you you'll never catch up. for instance, if you have 2 million sp and they have 60, you go up to 4 million skill points while they go up to 120 million skill points or worse. skill points take as long as they do so that not everybody is flying around in titans and capitol ships 6 months after they start the game.i think you have your whole frame of mind messed up. you shouldn't be paying to train skills, it's a waste of money. play for the experience that is eve online. you can still have fun without having x million skillpoints.while i do agree that it would be nice if caldary battleship 5 didn't take a month to complete (if you're lucky), the alternative is just as bad."
"what has one to do with the other? apples and oranges."
"no. wow is that way. ---->"
"the long training times to get to where you want to be is good, it's eve. we have had this for over 5 years and to be honest the people who have had it easy are the nerer players rather than the older players. skill times aren't broke, so don't mess with them."
"i think you got my suggestion wrong. what im proposing is reducing training times so it doesnt take over one year for me or anyone else to fly a command ship properly with decent skills.for all the older player that are worried about newer players getting something you did'nt you'll recieve 50% of the value of the sp's you presently have.rodj blake - you're the same age as my ceo so id guess you'd have the same amount of sp's as he has, around 70mil sp's ? my suggestion would give you approximately 35mil sp's and im sure you'd find something to use them on.drake draconis - post on your main if this is your main you dont know what your talking about.jin habarre - i dont want to fly every races ship to battleship, i just want to fly minmatar ships to bs to their maximum ability."
"no, its completely inter-related. if ccp didnt like ghost training, then implimenting a queue so people could ghost train 2,3,4 or more skills without ever subscribing would be clearly bad. so now they have no excuse."
"so, err, why is that good again? maybe if you dont want to spend a year doing it, you shouldn't be flying a command ship? there are plenty of ships that are smaller and easier to train."
"i think everyone got that point quite clearly. it is just that most seem to agree that this is exactly the way it should be. with less than a year, you don't have the logistics, supplies and buddies to make much use of one anyway. you don't need a command ship to make a commanding impact on the battlefield.nightmare. can't think of any other word for it.the game is not about getting what you want, just because you want it now, while at the same time breaking the whole game world to get you there. your suggestion doesn't work. plain and simple. if you think it through, it would be a total catastrophe for the game. eve would be nothing but junk in less than 6 months."
"it took me one year so why should you do it faster?"
"while in concept shorter training time is nice and i would love it my selfits could never be fair to the peaple who trained there skils on the slow timernow you could say the peaple get sp depost that they can spend in anny skil they want is not going to change annything in what some peaple would call the sp=skil ladderlet alone then alot of peaple would be able to do everything and im sure alot of peaple wil have nothing to train for that wil have a use for them so they spend it in things that there never going to useyes it can take some time to train into something and yes it can be boring but you have friends and corp mate's for that who can help ya or you can tag along with them in those pvp op mining and missionssp = not skilskil is learned in game not with stats and spso i give a big no for this"
"this"
"i may have changed my mind."
"its goons, what good can come from it?"
"you state this as a fact but its an opinion. how about some argumentation to back up your opinion and provide some valid points into this discussion?besides if you think black ops are different since they have a special role why not make a difference for 100% passive 4bn ships as well? they already are a different breed of ships since it doesn't require capital ships skill but are treated by the majority as a capital ship."
"if you don't have the support / brains to jump into low sec and go through a gate to high sec, you probably shouldn't be flying this ship. cynoing to high-sec takes all the risk out - its not that hard to cyno to low-sec next to high sec and use a gate and still exposes you to risk. you can cyno out of high-sec, that's good enough."
"was looking at smartbomb's today we got all sizes including micro smartbombs why not also capital as it stands to get a good smartbomb u have to pay a minimum of 100 mill (ts) and a realy good one up to 4-5 bil pls for us capital pilots give us a capital smartbomb :d"
"i suport miself"
"we need it :))suported"
"why?"
"efective at close range say give it bit more dmg like 2 k but over longar duration and 10-13 km range :dwhell fleet ops realy good lag killars couse they reduce the amount of lag using capitals would kill even more dronesjust my 2 cents"
"smartbombs aren't good as they are calculation intensive.so that's not something i can support."
"there are already 4 capital smartbombs in the game.....aurora ominaegjallarhornjudgementoblivioni think that's enough"
"enough? that's 4 too many.also, posting in a 'i want faction/officer mods without paying faction/officer mod prices' thread."
"i could support this given some changes in how smartboms work. most notably, have them emanate from the centre of the ship, not the edges. give capital sbs a longer range, and in effect it'll be the same as what they have now. also, this gives you room to better buff the officer smartbombs, because you're then not affecting the balance of supercapital ships when you do so. of course, since i think scatim has the right idea here, i don't think i'll be supporting you."
"thank you!so ... how near might this future be? is it going to be soon(tm), meaning we should resign ourself for the duration, or will it actually be a definition of 'near' recognizable as such?oh, and i like the idea of space claimed by alliances that have joined a faction as being claimed by the faction. obviously, there's some work to do in terms of figuring out what that would mean, but i certainly don't oppose the concept."
"agree"
"i really don't think it's going to happen... unless you weaseled a way thru some new fw content and schemes... unless its a total rehaul of fw... which is why i highly doubt the smoke and mirrors you toss out. you've fought hard on an issue that very few side with... and in return you have disregarded the thousands of people who are currently involved in fw, and the original intent of fw. involving alliance in fw's current state would be a disaster. let's hope you had good sense to talk about the mechanics of it, rather than the 'wa-wa-waaa' whines behind roleplayers."
"i will again refer you to"
"its going to happen. negative. its clear the majority of players want this to happen. negative. you are not \"thousands of players\" and you don't speak for \"thousands of players\". you are one player and you have made your argument and in the final analysis it was found wanting in the process of debate. and i don't believe you are qualified to speak of the \"orginal intent\" of fw any more than you can represent a vast unspoken majority. face facts, we've had the discussion and you didn't convince anyone.of course the mechanics were discussed. and as a solution i think it will satisfy pretty much everyone."
"first of all, i'm at work and havent had the time to read the whole thread so much of this may have already been shot down.i really like uglebs idea, but would suggest a few minor changes:a) make the average standing entry level be dependent on meber standings rather than corp standings. ie all members in u'k must have an average minnie standing of xx to join. also make a minimal standing requirement that applies to all members. ie u'k can't join if any member have a negative standing.b) make it so that no 0.0 sov holdning alliance can join fw. this will screw over cva pretty bad of course, as we'll go for a few months and then see the old \"you're not rp'ers at all\" etc being thrown our way all the time. but it would allow all other rp entities to join (i'm not aware of any other rp alliances holding sov anywhere). it would also mean that no 0.0 non rp alliances would ever join. not optimal, but i can't see why we should restrict u'k, sf and all the others simply to accomodate the one 0.0 holding rp alliance.c) in order to compensate poor old cva (and u'k should they ever decide to grab a bit of 0.0 again), make it so that you can set standing to the factions as a whole. ie cva could set standing to the minnie faction in one go, and any corp or alliance joining would then be subject to that standing. we could participate, but at a cost to our sec ratings. not optimal, i know, but far better than nothing.question is wether ccp will asign programmer resources to actually rectify the complete screwover they did of the rp community when they introduced fw. i doubt it.i'll pay some better attention to this thread when i get off work, and will probably find i'm wrong <U+FFFD>n all of the above points"
"give them their fw so i can go about my piraty business in peace *wishful thinking*"
"please... maybe just give us a limit of saving our last 10 emails. add some sort of organization to the email system. i'm not asking for a new version of outlook... just something simple."
"this suggestion is a part of our second package of issues, which i hope will get posted sometime in the near future.look forward to that!"
"right now the work around is save em in your notes.but if this is implemented at least let it only be an option you can enable/disable as some ppl might not want this feature.either way i'll support it as is"
"speaking of email difficulties, the sorting options are simply insane. let's tsay i want to look at my new emails. i sort by 'unread'. i then click on the first person who's sent me mail i haven't read. i click on the unread mail. so far so good.let's say the mail was a inquiry into joining my corp, and i want to respond. well, at this point, the person who sent the mail no longer counts as 'unread' which means that although i'm still reading the mail, the person's entry in my mail list has been resorted to some arbitrary position in the list, and has been unselected. this means that if i want to find out who sent it, that information is not encoded into the mail itself, so i need to note the subject line, and look through each person in my inbox until i find the person who has an email with the matching subject line.or, let's say my corp is having a discussing using corp mail. no matter how i sort the mails, there's no way to read posts in the order that they were read, meaning that context is lost unless everyone quotes the mail they responded to.who thought this stuff up? this needs to be changed so that, at a minimum:1) i can display a chronological list of mails recieved. this would likely require the index to display individidual posts, along with timestamps to sort by.2) sender is always displayed along with the mail.some useful extras:3) make the sender tag that gets added to the message a link, so that i can click on it and bring up mails that i've saved from that person.4) change the index portion of the screen depending on sort type: if i sort by sender, it shows me an entry for each sender, and i can click on a sender to bring up a list of messages from that sender. if i sort by timestamp, it shows me a list of the most recent few subject lines with sender and timestamp, along with links to pages older messages.there's a lot of email systems out there to model it on, none of which come close to being as bad as the one in eve.funny story: a while back, i recieved an in-game (mass) email from a developer asking for feedback on an event i had participated in. he wanted us to respond to his outside email, and said that the reason he wanted us to respond outside the game was that the ingame email was horrible!in any case, any improvement to the in-game mail system would be fantastic."
"there are faction drone bpcs? the augmented drones not actual drone faction ships right?"
"op: don't even try to get highsec missioners into lowsec. it'll fail. yes, if it wasn't for all that annoying pvp, the pvp-legal space would be pretty nifty."
"as nice and nifty as irony can be, it misses the point, unless someone had said pvp should be prohibited in lowsec. that is not the case, though.as it is, the galaxy is more or less divided into:99%-98% safe highsec0% safe lowsec0% safe 0.0the thing that would make highsec players go into lowsec would be:99%-98% safe highsec90%-0% safe lowsec0% safe 0.0i think that this is much more what ccp had in mind when they made the distinction between high and low security space. they just underestimated player's fear to venture into the unknown. as it is, most of lowsec is more dangerous than most of 0.0 and that misses the whole sec-part in lowsec. it could as well be called nosec, added to 0.0 and be done with it.it is likely true that it is bloody near impossible to lure players that normally wouldn't go into lowsec with some kind of glittering prizes. the reason for most not to go is not the lack of opportunities. it is the lack of safety.while you can (almost completely) safely fly around highsec in a shuttle, even a short single-jump trip to 0.4 in a tanked battleship can be fatal with the relevant factor being nothing but bad luck. people don't put their faith in karma, though. those who dislike losing don't go where the odds are completely unknown. if they were partly known and if they could rely on equalizing factors to at least some degree, some of them would venture forth.and don't just say that something will fail, because fail will failingly fail to unfail...there are many ways to skin a mink and if player psychology and game development were so easy to predict, a lot of game concepts would be completely different and at least 90% of all nerfs and buffs would never have been necessary in the first place. i leave it to those who do this stuff for a living to iron out the details of any potentially useful direction and since i have been in such a position myself before, i know that it is possible beyond what most on the outside may anticipate.a thing that will always fail is any attempt to persuade a large amount of people to make a jump into the dark. only few will make that jump, while most will hesitate first, or not do it at all. making them jump into a slightly darker shade of grey is much easier, though. one step, then the next and the next and before they realize they will willingly fly where no searchlights penetrate the darkness anymore."
"i dislike the idea of randomized concord presence in lowsec very much.if a pirate should attack a person, he would then be xx% likely to be instaganked by concord. seriously, not a good idea.if you wish to go down this road i'd rather see permanent concord presence in lowsec - but of far less effectivenes and response time than you see in highsec. so if, for instance a priate attacks a hauler in 0.4 he is set upon by a \"standard\" battleship rat and 2 cruiser rats but if he does the same in 0.1 he's only met by one rat cruiser. i'm still not in love with this idea though.i'd rather actually make lowsec more rewarding compared to high sec. the problem with this is that making lowsec missions more rewarding would introduce a lot of extra isk into the game as well as potentially making lowsec more rewarding than 0.0. the answer is obviously to nerf mission rewards in both lp and isk in high sec at the same time as low sec is boosted. or you could go by mara's original idea - with the slight change that only lowsec missions can escalate. this would still, of course, introduce additional iskies into the game, so a similar isksink would need to be introduced. my suggestion is to reduce mission rewards in high sec - but obviously even if this is necessary it's not going to happen."
"that doesn't work out, because it will end up pouring money into the pockets of those who are there anyway, while it would lure only very little new people in.any kind of npc presence that gets weaker in terms of firepower the further out it goes also makes no sense. concord and the empire faction's fleet commands would have to be braindead, if that was the case. the more dangerous an area is, the harder you hit, if you do so in the first place.eventually, it would be like modern slums in africa or south america. little to no police presence, ever. but when they come, they come in full force. they come armed to the teeth and they shoot first, ask questions later. they will not do it often, though.that is how lowsec should be. the slums of the empire.keep the background of the game world in mind, not just the game mechanics. the mechanics have to fit the setting, not the other way around."
"i don't get why people feel they have a right to get all of the in-game benefits for (using the op as an example) eight accounts if they are only paying for three of them at any time.* if i go to a restaurant with seven friends and pay for three meals, should i expect the restaurant to feed all eight of us?* if i subscribe to eight magazines, then stop paying for five of them, should i expect the publisher to keep sending all eight since i'm such a good customer?* if i subscribe to a newspaper, and cancel it, how long should i expect them to keep delivering it?c'mon, folks, it's a game that we pay to play, and ccp is in the business of making making by entertaining us. players began to more and more blatantly take advantage of the training system, so they finally decided they had to revise it. how many other premium online games not only let you improve your character while not actually playing, but allow you to do so while not subscribing to the game? i ackowledge that you got used the way they had been doing it, but i challenge you to head over to wow, subscribe, unsubscribe, and check back in a month to see how many levels you've gained. heck, stay subscribed but don't play and see how many levels you gain...in any case, i'm not sure what your proposal is, but if it involves you getting an advantage by training multiple accounts without even the slight mitigating factor of paying for multiple accounts, then you can consider me,/unsigned"
"well, if that is what you have, then that is a little bit more than what i have.besides, sp do not matter on this subject anyway. i know quite a few people who have been playing since beta and did not even know what ghost training was, and they have nearly 90 mill sp.right now i have cruiser v going and i am just playing the game like i normally do, but it seems 26 days for some of you is like a death sentence, and thus enter ghost training. i happen to like playing the game no matter how long of a skill i have."
"it's not a death sentence, per se. but after paying 3 months of doing nothing so i could cancel for one and come back to being barely useful instead of completely useless, feels kind of like i got betrayed. if i'm feeling betrayed, i don't even want to know how the people who fell for the \"power of two\" feel."
"can i have your stuff? honestly, everyone knew it was a bonus and never an intended feature.it sounds like ccp has been fine with a low level of it and the recent surge ****ed them off. i don't even have to log in to advance. no other game has that during a really busy week. if we finally get a skill queue i will be all set."
"[citation needed]"
"the best proposal i've heard is making a rig that allows any ship to be dropped via covert bridge. it'd be interesting to see an eas do that. however, as a straight ship effect, i can't support it - you want a bridging ewar ship, use a force recon."
"fuel problem. even if bops get fixed, eas's are going to be easier to send through the tunnel. also, given that eas's are more or less scale models of recons in terms of their ewar, the question is why can't eas's already be sent through the tunnel?"
"i am pro-communication, yes."
"i'm gonna use reverse psychology.ccp, ignore everything i say, k?"
"yes"
"one of the things we internally in csm has taken note of, is the bad communication that ccp has suffered with recently.so yes, this is a large issue!"
"i am very much in favor of ccps move to eliminate 'ghost training'. that having been said, it would not have hurt to give a bit more notice for those who'd been (ab)using the system as it existed.regarding the date for the nano-nerf, i disagree. i think it's fine to state what they plan to do (preferably with as much detail as possible) and welcome (reasonable) discussion while not giving a specific implementation date."
"i've always supported greater and better communication. it was one of ccp's strong points when i first joined, and one of the reasons i took an instant liking to eve, compared to the experience i'd had in other mmos."
"i agree communication hasn't been as good as it could have been. one thing i can say is that the bigger your company grows, the harder it becomes to fix up the communication problems. it's a pain to iron out the flaws but very rewarding for both the company and the customers in the end."
"ok so this bug has now been removed where people who were not paying subscription fees no longer got free skill training for their characters.one of the cases for ghost training was when people couldn't afford the full subscription charge so would be away for some time. so how about ccp introduce a downtime subscription whereby someone can pay a greatly reduced amount say $5 a month so they can keep skill training going, of course you wont be able to log in to the game so as to prevent exploitation.players would manage their own account and set those long skills before the reduced subscription kicks in.so ccp gets their income and customers have the choice to keep their characters skill training going, albeit at a reduced cost."
"it would be handy and if it doesn't take vast amounts of programming effort for some reason then why not?"
"i agree...someting more comprehensive then the 'tag' column should be developed."
"problem:the use of skill training based play in general is a capitalist based decision. as a company you can have thousands of paying accounts without having to host their bandwith/processing power as most of them are offline awaiting for the next skill to complete so they can get into their bigger or better class of ship. i can understand the choice here as a corporation to base the decision on player leveling this way, however as a mostly player run game (or so i am told/hope), i would ask that things be looked into so that a more even playing field be created.solution:learn the lesson from the game \"earth and beyond\" and make player skill advancement a situational event. let's look into this from a few different prospectives shall we?pirate: the first time you pop a (insert race) frigate, this should be worth alot of sp, however on the 50th identical pop it should be worth next to nothing as it is not a new event. or spending 20 total hours on a gate camp should be worth more sp then spending the same amount of time docked online or offline. ships and modules should be base on hours played/new events and not offline training those req skills and having the money. one encourages a player to be envolved in the game and the other encourages a player to be offline training for the most part.mission runner: each mission should be worth sp. lvl 1 = x. lvl 2 = x2, so on and so on. you are actively online and doing something and should get more of a sp reward then someone who is offline (standing increases be damned).miner: first veld is alot of sp, 50th is next to nothing. someone who has mined thousand of m3 of bistot should have more sp then someone who has only mined a few hundred m3. activly mining should be worth more sp then being offine. (money be damned)you see where i am going with this? one way rewards the guy who plays 20hours a day more then the guy who plays 2. is this not fair?solution t2 (in depth):i propose the following:a multiplier be added just for being online ie, intel base = 20 * 1.1 (online).a multiplier be added for each event like: reward = (mined ((roid * class) / (frequency of class or roid))) or (destroyed ((ship * class) / (frequency of class or ship)))modules and ships have an added requirement of time invested in the previous class. example: you should need to log 10hours in a frigate before being able to use a cruiser. same thing with a module, 20 hours and 3000 rounds required with the t1 varity before graduating to the t2 flavor. (note the times and rounds/shots are up for argument)people with multi-year accounts and hundreds of kills / losses be given block sums of sp to invest in the areas that they choose. this way the guys with 200hours total online and a 4 year old account can't be over taken by the guy with a 4 month old account who has played 200hours total online.optional extra:the ability to take (and this could be a pay feature) sp from a skill and put it into another field. ie. 20mil invested in being a miner? take it all and invest it into pvp or pve.in conclusion:don't screw over the people who have invested their time and money thru the years and come up with a repayment method for them and in the future require an online time investment with actual game-play (sitting in station does not cut it) for all future ship/module/skill use.let justice be done."
"no thanks. eve's sp system is one of its most outstanding aspects, and rewards both casual and hardcore players without turning the game into a grindfest korean mmo. it also prevents players from feeling pigeonholed into one \"class\" because of an uninformed decision they made when they first started the game.your \"solution\" would encourage players to keep their computers on 24/7, and force people to log on just after downtime to log onto eve again if they wanna max out their sp gains. in addition, it would mean that being a \"jack of all trades\" character is manditory, and force players to go around doing every possible activity they can think of in order to collect sp. either that or start macro-mining. but in any case, it would make having a single focused profession completely impractical."
"this is a dreadful, horrible idea.from day 1, eve's skill system has been an outstanding idea that differentiates it from the other ****ty mmos, and means its not a grind to develop your character. the \"grind\" is for isk, but even that isn't true for people who make isk not from pve."
"i've spent the last few minutes trying to think of a idea worse than the op's. i've come up with letting all t1 frigates fit doomsdays, but even that's not coming close."
"what are you a communist? if a man works harder then another man he should be rewarded. they both should not recieve the same reward. you mean people would have to actually play the game? ugg how horrible. but, yes it would force people to spend more time playing the game. ohnoes!how do you see that? it would still allow training under the existing model, however it would reward the guy who does more of everything. i don't think it is mandatory i think in the future it would allow you to choose what you want to do when getting online, ie. do i wanna mine or pew pew because i have the sp for both and am no a longer 1 specfic trade charactor. yes! that is the point entirely! have you been to the second moon of planet 3 in jita? no one has. the point of the whole argument is to force players to explore their mmorpg universe and reward those who have gone further or pew pew'd more than the guy who has done less."

"not that that is a good or bad idea, but this is an industry thread. not a mission or high sec in general thread. did i miss something in your post?"
"since ccp stop the ghost training prog. we would suggest that to enable 3 characters in 1 acct to be train together.so we can still transfer our active acct to an another active acct when one is off for long session of training. youdont expect us to maintain 20 accts for 1 whole year dont you..i would like to have your vote on this. thanks and best regards to you all.p.s we all love eve online.hope ccp will love us all."
"if you want 20 active and skilling characters, that is exactly what i would expect you to do. however, i can't even understand the urge to have more than 1 or 2 secondary characters.and the game doesn't cost a fortune anyway. if the game is such an important and dominant part of your life, that you need to manage a whole private army of characters to play it, it should still be worth the money. actually, even more so. just think what a partner, a pet or any other hobby would cost instead. however, i support the basic point of your suggestion, which as far as i understand it is multiple skilling character slots per account. not just as is, though. i think ccp should just remove the 3 characters limit from the accounts and instead make it as many alts as you want, with each alt beyond 2 and each skill slot beyond 1 costing extra. let the players chose how much they need. in one account, if they prefer."
"my view on this:- 1 character in training = full speed- 2 characters = each progresses at half speed- 3 characters = each progresses at 1/3rd the speedif you want two characters to progress at full speed you need two accounts. and yes, more slots on the account would be nice. a cap of 5 instead of 3 should do."
"well im against the ghost training nerf as it stops people doing stupidly large skills while not paying.how ever, to equalize this i think that all other things should be stopped i.e researching....i think this may keep most people happy whule not giving a huge advantage to inactive accounts.there are only so many skills that would be worth training while inactive and aslong as the people are only allowed to train 1 skill while inactive, they wont stay inactive for to long"
"when i started playing eve, which was not so long ago, there was one thing that immediately bothered me. it kept bothering me, still does and with more and more knowledge on how the game works it seems just plain wrong to me.the issue is the transition from empire highsec to 0.0or to be more precise: there is practically none.for all that matters, lowsec is completely misnamed, because there is no relevant sec that could be low. lowsec is nosec and in many aspects just like 0.0. in some points it is even worse, because the borderline is defined so clearly, making easily campable.what i suggest is a more fluent transition between the two and to achieve that i suggest the addition of active npc fleets/flotillas.lowsec is still empire, owned by an empire faction and theoretically patrolled by that faction. not frequently, but still patrolled. what else guarantees the empire faction's system sovereignty, if they wouldn't care the least bit what happens there?practically it isn't.so add military and concord combat groups that patrol the systems from highsec to lowsec. from 1.0 where a small group of 1-2 fleet cruisers or 2 frigates will be enough to 0.1 where it will more likely be 1-2 battleships with escort. on the other hand however, the frequency of patrols should be the other way around. the higher the security rating, the more frequent the proportionally weak patrol.so in highsec, we would frequently see a few small military vessels that take tours around the system, jumping from belt to belt, planet to planet, gate to gate, station to station and so on, engaging and destroying any reds they encounter. any pc and npc reds alike, of course. so it might happen that a fleet patrol comes to a belt and kills the beltrats there.in lowsec the combat groups would be larger, as mentioned, but there would be fewer of them, that would make less thorough tours of the systems. especially there would not be combat groups for each system, but instead constellation combat groups that would prefer higher lowsec systems over the lower.in addition to that, these fleets would take the role of concord in lowsec, but without instant appearance. instead, in cases where normalle concord would spawn, these combat fleets would actually have to move there from whereever they were at the moment, even if it is two systems away.what i think this would bring to eve is this:1. better game world immersion due to visibly active nps factions.2. blurred borders and less gate camping, making high lowsec actually safer than 0.0 borderline and 0.0.3. cat & mouse thrills for pirates, who'd actually have to evade the armed forces.4. more highsec players would dare venturing into the higher lowsecs, thus blurring the border even more and acting as fear therapy for paranoid carebears. eventually it would encourage more players to leave the safe havens eventually.5. more uncertainty. players could not easily predict how safe it is to operate in any given lowsec system. both non-pirates and pirates.6. a low risk of minor additional lag factors. i don't think that a handful of npc ships operating in a system can be that relevant, though. each highsec gate is camped by navy ships already.7. captains attacked in lowsec would at least have a faint hope of getting rescued, which would also encourage pirates to work fast and stay alert.pirates could still engage in piracy, but like pirates and not like african warlords. lowsec would be clearly different from 0.0, more risky for some, safer for others and all in all more turbulent, diverse and thrilling.last but not least, these combat groups would not even have to automatically engage and fight anything and anyone that is hostile. the first thing they could do is demand an immediate end of hostilities. if the pirates withdraw, no shots need to be fired. also adds immersion and game world credibility.opinions please."
"well i'd halt short of calling them whiners, although they definitely border this. the problem is it is a huge misconception that wrecks = loot. it is not loot. i saw in an old thread where ccp prism made some good comments on the subject. empire space he said, whether a mission spawned ds pocket or otherwise, belongs to empire, thus probing and entering this space, is not intrusive to the mission runner. second, another player in the same thread mentioned other mmos, while tryign to avoid equating anything to any specific other, i'll still use the common knowledge of wow (since a larger percentage seems to have this experience) to make the point. if you kill a creature in wow, you and only you may loot it. however if i come along with the skills to skin the creature, i can skin it, what is left behind is the loot bag, with your loot still in it. this is strangely similar to eve's method, all except in one way. rats in missions are not in the commonly accessible area of the world (as in wow you can run by and often see people killing things in open areas) however this is a misconception, missions are run in commonly accessible areas, you just need probes to find them. the earlier statement by prism stating that empire space is owned by empire makes this clear, it is no different than happening upon someone by walking by them slaughtering a tiger and skinning the kill for yourself with no repercussions, as to probing a mission runner down and salvaging the wrecks from that which he's killed. i've played eve for a long time, i was here during the closed beta when we didn't even have autopilot and had to use a third party app to find the route in which would take us where we wished to go. probes weren't around, and when you killed something it died into a can. the loot tables have not changed much in the last five years. if anything they've gotten better. people routinely make the statement that we are cutting into their \"profits\" of their missioning. the problem with their assumption here is 2 fold. 1) it's their profits to be had and 2) that it is really a large portion. an example here. if i come across an empty mission after they've completed it, i'll loot everything as well. everything ranging from lots of 100mn mwds (800k isk) and meta 0(t1)-4 1600mm plates (300-2mil isk) and tons of various high end weapons (in 2 missions i gathered 7 prototype auto cannons alone, around 7.8 mil total) the total salvage from 1 mission is pretty high, but hardly a majority. even if it was a large portion, before salvage no one complained. salvage was not added to benefit you as missions runners, it was added completely seperate to this, so your complaints are invalid. mission runners do little but run missions, drinking from a stream of endless isk. sure those of us who salvage (i hate the term ninja salvage as it is some what pejorative and in truth, true salvaging involves hunting down those wrecks to salvage, whether another killed them, they crashed on their own, or whatever) did not kill the wrecks, but this doesn't matter, this is what we do, continue your missions, but seriously stop trying to have cake and eat it too.in conclusion, ccp has forced this method upon us. we cannot probe down wrecks, but only those running them. given this, we've little choice as pure salvagers (not missioner salvagers) but to do this. given this, there is but one and only one assumption. salvaging as a viable occupation must and only must include salvaging others wrecks."
"since this thread got bumped im totally laying down my stance ;p[x] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic."
"i think the idea was to express why... not just your choice."
"i have very little to say, but it is the biggest stfu to you whining ninnies. you do not have to train learning skills...sorry for the cruise control. but you don't. when you train learnings, you don't actually lose time, so to say. lets pretend with hypothetical skills. you have lvl 2 in advanced learning ...logic for this example. and you have skill x at 4, to go to 5, it actually saves you time to get logic up one point. this may take 7 hour, but it saves you a total of 12...and so you actually have saved 5 hours. how this is a time sink, i do not know...what i do know is that i never straight trained any learning skill. i simply trained it when the numbers added up to me saving time by spending 8 hours training a skill to save 15 hours of training another...its all how you look at it. stop complaining, these skills have been here since day one, you've not, don't come in crying because we've already trained them and you've yet to."

"i don't know if the csm are aware but ccp already plan a redone of citadel torpedo hp vulnerability thing. i thought i would save you, csm, the trouble of going over it.link to ccp post:"
"stop! wait! wait! i figured out where i'm failing to answer your questions and how to answer themyou're saying that because wealth in 0.0 (available resources) is a zero-sum game, i can't give the small alliances anything without taking from the large. however, i'm talking about boosting the income of 0.0 overall, so it's there are more resources available and it's no longer a zero-sum game. why, yes, i support opening the treasure chest to all.as far as the zero-sum of sov, i hope that the new sov tool and fast routes to income would together increase the volatility of assets, resulting in more power passing through more hands. in that sense, it's definite that i'm proposing taking sov from the haves and making it readily attainable (don't landmine me!) to the have-nots. to address this obvious unfair redistribution, the value of stable sov will be increased a great deal and sov will be made more meaningful by a shift from space-sticks based sov rewards to space-bling based.as far as entropy, the reaction barrier via the pos is very high. entropy would favor the disorganization of power. more is better favors the conglomeration of power. the only way large multicellular organisms fight entropy is by increasing entropy outside the system. that is, in order to maintain power, to prevent the steady erosion towards disorder, you have to be consuming energy.in eve, the energy level of a system can be modeled as a reaction diagram. the energy state of organized power should be higher relative to lower states of organization. however, because the mechanism of power transfer to lower organizational states has a much higher activation energy (relative) than the activation energy for transfer from organized to organized, most power transfers are from one organized alliance to another.in this model, raising the volatility means lowering the activation energy of power and wealth transfers to lower organization states, resulting in a higher rates of transfer.second issue is that the pos acts like a molecular ratchet, a molecule which stores the random energy and, to an extent, defies entropy. when a molecular ratchet stores energy, it holds onto it in a higher energy state that is quite stable only because it blocks the reverse reaction pathway, something that shouldn't happen according to second law of thermo and micro-reversibility principle. when a pos is placed by a large alliance, it's much like this molecular ratchet in that it is the result of a fairly minor sov conflict, but is now in a higher energy state that can't go through the reverse pathway, thus breaking the reverse reaction. this creates a situation where a relatively easy reaction is turned into a nearly impossible reverse reaction. equilibrium thus occurs far away from where the reality of energy states would have it occur.sov entropy is broken in eve because of how the pos prevents the reverse reaction in some cases. :-)ship entropy in sov warfare is broken in eve because of carrier circle-jerks manufacturing armor and shields from thin air, but that's an entirely different matter.the $20 question is how to break the molecular rachet and let the reaction loose. i surmise that the mechanism of this rachet requires opportunities for organization on the part of organized powers and that increasing the volatility will give them less time to respond and take away their size advantage by forcing them disperse or nullify it by reacting before the ratchet mechanism can take place.thermodynamics level iv 135,765 sp"
"no, that is not what i am saying. i am saying that power is a zero-sum game. increasing everyones wealth doesn't do anything to the system, entrenched alliances still hold the power. you have to necessarily decide that you are going to intentionally alter the power balance of 0.0 if you want to advantage start up organizations. you have failed to make this acknowledgment and because of it, your ideas fail. they fail to produce your goal, since your goal is impossible. and they fail to produce a better power balance for eve since they aren't aimed at the problem.people are not unintelligent logical operators without goal. your description thus has nothing to do with anything as it actually pertains to the game. even if it was not, your theory[which is wrong] would state that removal of pos would bring about an equilibrium state faster. which is bad."
"power, if affected by the total amount of players and activity in 0.0, will also increase, and then neither is power a zero-sum game. existing 0.0 alliances might absorb a lot of the new elements or may face dilution overall. that's up to the dynamics of the game.the volition, choices, needs, and capabilities of people are conceptually compatible with the models used to understand and predict the behavior of molecules that have reaction kinetics, affinities, reaction sites, and multiple equilibria and major and minor products. anyone who takes enough chemistry courses eventually runs into at least one professor who uses analogous human contexts to explain the complexities of chemical relations. i'll bet you 2 isk someone somewhere has used game theory to describe chemical systems of some kind. in that respect, game theory can probably likewise be modeled as cases of chemical systems. the concepts are without a doubt more similar than they are dissimilar.removal of the pos isn't a goal. if that happened, it would be more comparable to removing a whole class of chemicals and their interactions. repairing the reverse-reaction mechanism would be a goal. that involves lowering hp and stront timers or adding more granular mechanisms at the pos. the multi-grid solution achieves the latter by giving an outnumbered alliance the alternative goal of harassing detached forces, defensive or offensive, while remaining mobile and writing off the tower as an acceptable loss or impossible objective."

"my two cents on pvp in eve.pvp in eve doesn't happen when the ships are fireing at each other. pvp in eve is all done before that. pvp is mostly intelligence gathering. what ships? where? backup? who? the best plan always wins, the worst plan always looses. going in with the wrong ships and numbers against a enemy, will get you killed, vica versa. you say someone got ganked in a non-combat ship? well, they had the tools to avoid getting ganked, so boo fricking hoo, they deserved to loose their ship because they didn't pay attention."

"that's stupid. not only is that an easy way to lose your characters, but skill training is hardly something that requires a lot of time. you'd spend more time coding the macro than you would just managing the skills."
"i'll assume for a moment you have zero experience in any sort of coding. for large software projects, yes it is a long ordeal to get things written, working, and in a good form. scripts? i can write a web interfacing vote bot, or a cute little aim bot, or as you've said, a skill training bot that uses web based skill changing, in less than 10-15 minutes. for a web based authentication, and changing of a skill, it would consist of about 50 lines of perl script. the majority of that script being generic support for the modules used for web interfacing (lwp) and simple routines for reading a skill plan file and changing the skill at the correct time. it'd be simple. it would happen. it's fine as it is. as for losing characters, people don't lose characters that often selling them on ebay, the buyer may lose them, but the seller, he gets paid. he can afford his accounts using isk farmed from a farming account buying gtcs...bad idea, skill training is fine as it is, remaining so will be no complaints from me.as for the original post, i'm confused as to what the patch has caused problem wise? it does but one thing, stops people from advancing whilst the account is unpaid. fine by me. if you play any other mmo (where you grind for skill/xp as we do massive amounts of isk here...) you cannot cancel subs and continue to level up, why would you expect ccp to allow the same? ridiculous notion my friend. ccp does well, in my opinion some of the best customer interaction and shifting their game play to the majorities needs, unlike any other experience in any mmo i've played. eve has come a long way since the first time i played in closed beta (didn't even have autopilot, thank goodness for whomever had coded that eve-routefinder...) ccp deserves every cent they make, as i truly feel the majority of that goes back into development of a good game. there is still some rough edges to polish, but the fact it inconveniences you that you don't skill up while on an unpaid account is not part of what needs to be polished...."
"sorry herschel... but you'd think differently when you take into account that in this day and age... no one gives a damn about how much time.all it takes is one guy to do it... then sell off the script/macro/idea/product (legally or illegally) and now its very quick and easy to implement.i would have thought you would have figured that out by now.: o )in the age of computers... it gets easier all the time. just a question of motivation... and will power.joe gamer may not have skills or time.. but they do have the motivation and will to find a way.... and find a way they will.oh and i do have programming experience.... i would guess its safe to assume you don't.don't get me wrong tho.... great feature... i'd love it... but it's potential for abuse is a bit high. so if a way can be engineered to prevent that kind of thing from happening.... i'm all ears...and all thumbs up.otherwise... bad...bad idea."
"i smell an uber geek./me appluads"
"i don't have a vast amount of programming experience, but i am well aware that scripts are very easy to make. i know it wouldn't literally take longer to make the script, i intended that phrase as a commentary on how little time skill-swapping takes. that said, i just ran the numbers on what skilling up a character for sale will get you, and it's surprisingly little - depending on how you choose to count, herschel would fetch me a profit of 1-4 billion after costs, which at gtc prices is $70-280. assuming you can get cash at the same rate as you get isk from gtcs, that's less than $1 per skill swap, which is hardly worth it for some actively trying to make money, but it's more than enough to justify macroing. i can't imagine ccp puts up with ebaying of characters - it's way, way too easy to spot and shut down, either at the level of nuking the character or at the level of petitioning ebay to take it down - but assuming it was possible i would actually almost expect to see this as an issue. it appears my point may have been made in error - it depends a lot on what numbers you use, because there aren't hard and fast prices for a lot of this, but there may well be a market to be had in character farming. of course, this raises the question of why this isn't done already. is there some reason this macro wouldn't work right now? yes, ccp just closed the profit margins somewhat, but there's still money to be made. you just said how easy it is to make and distribute this macro, so why can't we assume that everyone who would do this is doing it already? the topic at hand here is a skill queue, and if a skill macro is so trivial, where's the harm in ccp doing it for us? anyone who wants to use one for profit already has a reason to, you're just giving the same capability to those of us who want to use it for fun."
"i suppose you got a valid point there.but also keep in mind that ebay... as well known as it is.... isn't the only form of selling your accounts.i've already met 1 who obviously bought his... no proof.. but everyone seems to think so for rather strong reasons.even then... its not really my business to point fingers on something you cant prove.but it can be done...and likely will be the case for many months to come... if not years.i guess what i'm trying to get at... is this would potentially make it easier... to exploit that.but if there where safeguards in place or some sort of \"ccp approves this method and regulates it\" then i don't have a problem with it.but after some thought in light of what you brought up... i'd have to take a step back and think about it."
"no waythat's an interesting idea. so what would you get from the sonar, just a bearing?"
"i think it was largely a cash grab, but i also think there's nothing we can do about it - any company that lets the customers dictate the price is a company soon to be enacting the \"something for nothing\" business model. if you don't like the price, stop paying it. not my preferred situation, but not one i'm going to argue my way out of either."

"5+ years, and it comes to this.."
"ccp has to rethink the ghost training part ... it was the main reason why i ve started with eve (no joke)without it it just looks like ccp tries to bind the player with long skilltrianing times as long as they can (a cheap trick) to get as much money as possible from each customer(all accounts canceled till ghost training is back)"

"bad move ccp i never once heard anyone in any chat complain about \"ghost training\". this was one of the great features of eve and what the people complaining now dont seem to see is that yes the characters are inactive or unsubbed but they still get brought back online to change the skill meaning you still have to pay to train. this is going to hurt ccps bank account more than us as players"

"ccp wants to drive there company into the ground by screwing over there player base. they would never try to make up for it by giving us something that has been needed for years. no not ccp. i have always supported this idea."
"definitley"
"yes please"
"the very least ccp can do now that it's screwing over it's playerbase by making multi-account running more expensive."
"no nerf, no nerf, no nerf *brings torch and pichfork*no seriously, a bit of fine tuning might be required tho."
"against the nerf if you can even call it a nerf. ccp has taken small gang warfare chopped it up into little pieces with a chainsaw and set it on fire. ccp you fail"
"after further consideration, i've changed my position from my previously held & (elsewhere) stated opinion and so support the issue raised, as it has been edited by serenity."
"abolutely."
"you aren't going far enough.once an account laspes it should stay paying impound fees on all items in all stations. prolly make it equal to say 1 isk per m3 per day of laspe.then you need to lose sp when you lapse because you know. use it or lose it. i would say 100k sp per day off of the highest sp skill first.then your rp should just go away. you unsubbed they don't know you anymore. you shuold have to regrind all of your positive factions but keep your negatives.finally you should all ....sorry. don't really care much about the loss of ghost training especially if we finally get a skill queue but all the whining about it has annoyed me."
"firm beleiver in pay to play, not paying shouldn't equal an inflated wallet."
"i agree with this, it should really have been considered by the gm's when ghost training was on the board!"
"yes! and throw out chars who haven't been subscribed for over a month. damn those leeching database fillers!!!it allways makes me laugh when companies claim stuff like this is stretching their hardware while the performance/dollar ratio of that hardware doubles every 1-2 years. storage, bandwith and calculation power have never been cheaper and will continue to get cheaper pretty much forever. yet ccp needs to nerf things like ghost training and up prices? instead of laughing i should really be crying shouldn't i?"
"when ecm ships got a boost, they forgot to boost eccm modules to match the change. now everywhere you go (especially in low sec) there is falcons everywhere.it is simply not possible to roam in low sec in a small gang without brining your own falcon to jam their falcon. this is just silly.eccm modules should get a much needed boost."
"but falcons are caldari... nerfing caldari is not allowed ok?"
"when did ecm ships get a boost? was that about the same time as ecm got it's strength reduced 50%?"
"entertainment ftw"
"alliance tourney >>> csmif it's a budget issue then it's a no-brainer ... the first is worth the money, the second isn't, that is all"
"yes!"
"yes please"
"yey"
"/support from the initiative."
"thumbs up from me.needs moar evetv tbh"
"yes! and support evetv while you are at it!! duh!"
"evetv is dead get over it.as for the alliance tournament sure bring it back."
"i'd like to know why ccp thought we might not want it back? i was starting to wonder what was taking so long to announce the next one."
"cos they cancelled them."
"yes"
"yea defo"
"yes."
"oh yes!"
"one of the things that infuriated me about the alliance tournament was the way the commentators talked about billions of isk like it was nothing. perhaps that's why today we have devs balancing the game around snake sets and t2 rigs."
"with rules that aren't stupid and reward luck."
"has my support. the alliance tournament is always a great thing to watch and talk about for weeks before and after its been and gone."
"billions of isk is nothing to an alliance. it is a lot for a character. 1 significant amount for most corps. and petty cash for the biggest alliances. you seriously think an alliance feilding multiple 60 bil+ titans is going to think even 5 bil a horrendous blow?now yeah a bil is tons for the rest of us. my total net worth for me and the wife after almost 1.5 years together is likely under 5 billion. net worth includes all assets. my wallet is under 10m."
"def need this, its one of the things ya just have to watch."
"i always enjoyed watching these, as did many other players. fully supported..."
"look, this is a really simple issue.we have some truely great third-party tools that interacts with the api. overall, the api is fairly decent. however, there's some which we need to truely make the api usable:a contracts api.there's a disconnect in the data which you can get from the api at present. filling in an api for contracts would fill most, if not all, of this gap.so here's a request for ccp to finally add one of the missing things from the api. please make the api truely useful and wonderful!"
"signed"
"sounds good."
"i personally would like also like a blog about the status/direction the api is heading in..."
"i drool a little too heavily at the thought of going from 27msp to 54msp. that would let me finish so many skills that i want to train. on the other hand the 70msp player going to 140msp has me about to wet myself. every titan to v."
"stadshage - i can solo all lvl4 missions and do lvl5 missions often (getting boring), my alt flys a hulk (totally boring), pvp i dont like as i dont see ganking noobs or using the mob mentality ftw fun."
"hell no!you gain the bulk of your characters abilities very rapidly, maxing skills out is the preserve of a veteran pilot. think about it, at lvl 5 your character reaches the peak of his abilities in that skill. he can ever get any better at it. that should be an achievement and not one that comes easily. eve is meant to be played for years, not months. there are meant to be goals to achieve ahead of you and the 'most powerful' craft and equipment is the preserve of the veteran pilot - if it isn't then what will you have left to aim for after two years of playing? why should everyone be flying elite battleships? they would no longer be 'elite'."
"i don't have 70mill sp's and let me tell you, if i had 50% more i could probably max out on pretty much every capital ship skill. then what am i aiming for? then what is the point of training?"
"while i disagree with the \"ghost training\" nerf business, i'm starting to get sick of the serious case of stupids which has swept the forum of late.just because you're waiting for a skill to train,it does not mean you can't keep playing the game while your skill is training.if you want some quick gratification, try jerking off. as things are, if you don't think it is worth paying money for to train it, then don't train it. i only ever liked \"ghost training\" because i respected the fact that in the \"hit by the no. 3 bus to cheswick\" style scenario i could have a character train while unfortunate external events prevented me from playing. now, hopefully, this can be locked."
"qft"
"smartbombs have limited range for good reasons. you should not be able to hotdrop a carrier and uber smartbomb everything smaller than a battlecruiser within, what, 15-20km of your ship?fighters and drones (along with most frigates) would be rendered utterly useless by a smartbomb with extended range and damage that can instapop them outside of their engagement range. especially as it would be a t1 mod built from a bpo which makes it highly affordable.dictor spheres would be renderred pretty much obsolete as the dictor would not be able to drop a sphere outside of smartbomb range.if you want that kind of power on one ship then you have top pay the premiums. either on faction/officer loot or on a titan. capital ships should not be solo pwn mobiles and this would be tipping the odds too far in a capital ships favour.i do fly them and this would not be good for game balance."
"this is an idiotic change, with no rationale aside from 'i want a rly big big smartbomb because capital pilots want one', which i, at least, don't find particularly compelling. there are many reasons to not implement a larger smartbomb, among them the fact that tacklers are already at a disadvantage against capital ships due to heavy energy neutralizers and drones, and the fact that easily available faction smartbombs can hit out to warp scrambler range (not that anyone uses those, but still). capital ships already have extremely potent defensive and offensive capabilities, and in the case of carriers, have effectively no limitations or downsides. giving them an additional offensive module would be idiotic."
"i have been running l4 missions for almost a year now and i have yet to shoot a tier 3 battleship. why are these ships missing from missions? are the npc pirate factions too poor to purchase these ships or is ccp too lazy to program them?i move to rework missions to add tier 3 battleships to the list of targets.edit:add tier 2 bc to the list of ships to be worked in.add more variety to the ships seen in missions."
"i am not sure how much being lazy has anything to do with why a certain tier ship isn't in missions i do like the idea of shooting something besides the same ships over and over again. eve has over 300 ships in it. save seeing capitals in lvl 4's i wouldn't be opposed to a larger cross section of ships added to the npc pirates."
"yes, and tier 2 drakes too and myrdmidons, absolutions and you know... we need them much"
"realistically we are talking about a culture that is essentially far superior to our current irl. i imagine a few tweaks to the ole mail box should be supported. seeing as how its 2008 and even microsoft has this one figured out."
"i suggested this as a useful feature in the last ccp/csm meeting. the csm supported it and ccp acknowledged it. changes to mail system are being looked at in the very near future.take care,arithron"
"i suport the idea but have a realy hard felling lets do a background chek :we whanted nano's nerfed (first nerf when domis wore going 8 km/sec)they changed it to curent sistem we whanted more nerf we are getting ab's better then mwdso as a great man spoken :no battle plan ever survises contact with the enamy so do i say no nerf plan ever survises with ccpif they will nerf it it will be nerfed so hard u wont be able to find ure corp mate if u are 1 au from him nerf it but do it gentle"
"silly whiners. this isnt a big deal. if you need 8 active accounts to feel happy you have other bigger issues you need to sort out than the fact that you cant pay for them. it was a nice feature, now its gone, its not a big deal. now, start redoing the bloody ui :p"
"now let me get this straight. are you implying that ccp announced that they are disabling the skill training when your character is not online or are they disabling the ghost training for inactive accounts.i'm pretty sure that it's the latter and your incoherent rambling and disaster prediction is not only uncalled for, but also a strong indication that you are trolling or unable to grasp reality.the categories of people you are mentioning are not able to play 23x7 . i am a member of the afore mentioned groups (not a student) and my workload keeps increasing steadily. i can't be online every day not to mention for prolonged periods.still i am able to afford and pay for the account i own (and i could easily afford a second but don't want too) which gives me the right to enjoy the services ccp offers. one of them is being able to train my skills while i am not playing the game.i can't understand why someone who is not paying for an account, should enjoy the same services as a paying customer does.if there are people who would not reactivate their accounts because they can't finish training a skill while they don't pay their sub, i can safely assume that they don't like the game either. they are just in here for playing with new toys only, until they get bored of them. to these people i wish good luck on their next game and would ask them to contract to me their stuff."
"they hunt whales... end of story"
"fixed for you :d i have used it transfering my alt and the wife's alt from trial to full account. it makes me less angry when i miss a skill change cause i can go hey i already got 2 weeks for free."
"i am in full support of ccp's decision to get rid of ghost training. personally it speaks to players trying to extend beyond their means imo. if i can only afford one character to train, then thats my own financial issue. its their game, we just pay to play it.my heart goes out to the individials whom have been effected by the latest financial crisis and i pray for your families to continue to have food and a roof over their heads.internet space ships is serious business, just not irl."
"well, ppl start whining cause this is the 2nd time in a matter of months that they make eve cost more, first the gtc price raise, and now this... these changes are hurting the hard core multi-account players bad! and in the end those are the players that make eve an interesting game and provide a lot of ccp's income. i hope for their sake they did not shoot themselves in the foot with these 2 measures...."
"any players quitting because of this won't be missed or even noticed since they obviously don't have their accounts active anyhow."
"i honestly don't get what the hell the problem is.if your so upset... then stop playing.money talks... not whiners.if they see a major drop off in subscriptions... then you will get there attention.no ones forcing you to pay for something you don't like.so leave already.... and let the rest of us brainwashed folk continue playing the game."
"they're miniature combat recons, not miniature force recons. combat recons can't be bo bridged."
"this needs to be implemented fast, bloody outrage this hasn't been done sooner."
"signed"
"while i appreciate that people like this idea, i disagree with it. eve has always demanded the element of trust be required in cooperative operations and this proposed change would act to remove that requirement in an important area of application."
"heyhas any candidate been pushing for a redo of the overview and ui?im ready to vote for the one that promise to scramble and web some devs until they promise to fix the crap. :p"
"nobody has come out on that platform yet, but very few candidates have announced thus far. i'm quite sure somebody will run for the csm with the ui as a major part of their platform pretty soon, though."
"why is it we have a check box allowing us to support a csm suggestion but no option to reject the proposal?give us a thumbs down button!"
"this has been posted several times before - please use the existing old thread here or the smaller but newer thread here."
"this was the original thread over at the features and ideas section.thanks to inactivity locked by now ^^the main problem is that it is possible to lock yourself out of the chance to ever fly a mission again for specific factions. more details/info/discussion in the original/locked thread.i would like to encourage anyone to 'revive' this problem, because i think its an issue that contradicts the principle that eve stands for."
"make a friend run an l1 mission for a corp of the opposing faction. turn in for gang. you now have standings with that corp and can get storylines again after completing 16 missions just like everyone else.before you **** every other faction why not start and fail a mission for 1 corp of everybody. then train diplomacy 1 and you have positive corp standings again.the only ones this doesn't work on are the pirate corps where you can rat the corp standing to nothing and mission the faction standing to nothing. then you have to get personal standing with 1 specific agent and use that agent forever until your corp and faction can be rebuilt. join a corp with good standings for a few days.with it using the highest of personal standing with agent, corp, or faction or corp standing with agent, corp, or faction there are plenty of ways to get out of the hole. it will likely take longer to recover than to screw yourself though."
"if you screw your faction standings 'good' enough, you wont be able to fly for any corp/agent of that faction. even if you have +10 corp standing, a -2 faction standing (after adjustment with diplomacy) will prevent you from doing anything for that corp.the only chance is to get derived faction standings - but as is already stated in the linked thread (if you would care to read) - at least for some factions its quite easy to lock yourself out completely.and ofc the fact that killing structures / ships of npc factions will drop the according standings without getting whatever increase in standings with hostile factions just adds to the problem."
"you had the perfect ship for the job. and you put it in low sec only. where it now sits at a pos, compressing ore. or used as a hauler. what a sad end for a great idea. used in empire it would have been the centerpiece of mining operations, and provided a way for meduim sized corps to dip their toes in low sec. with out the full blown (time) commitmant of a pos. also would have been used for exploration i.e grav siteswould also have encouraged low sec ninja mining on a corp scale. subject to been able to cyno back to hi sec space."
"well the orca is going to be a cap ship. likely like the freighter that can use gates because i don't see what purpose a second a second jump capable ore capital would serve but meh.here's to having to go spend the billion isk on cap ship skill books still. it was a significant part of the barrier to entry. i really hope these mini-freighters don't take more than 500m in books."
"i'd really like to see more specialized transport ships.strontium haulers, race specific isotope haulers, mineral haulers and so forth. would make hauling a bit more interesting without destroying logistical difficulties even more (like jbs and jfs have)."
"definitely an area i would like to see some development on. it's one of my aims in the next csm in fact! communication is always good, as it prevents misunderstandings and mistrust.take care,arithron"
"clicky buttan?"
"i don't know if this is a good idea or what effect would it have on other players, but i would use this feature if rl kicks in (beeing a freelance programmer i never know when i'll get to work on an urgent project)... so, you have my vote"
"i can't imagine ccp could support this as a business model, and i don't want to think of what it'd do to the character market. i'm not convinced it's a good idea, and i am convinced it won't be used the way you want it to be."
"suggested this myself elsewhere but no longer in favor of it after i realized how it would make the job for character farmers only easier."
"this would be used as a tool for training capital ship alts on the cheap. i'd rather people use isk to buy gtc to play if they can't afford the sub, then they at least can still login for some gameplay when they aren't grinding for isk to pay for the next gtc. this is afterall what the gtc system was intended for. also, if your wallet is so tight then you can't afford to continue subscribing then you probably can't afford the reduced fee either. it would be false economy."
"1) why is this such a bad thing? it makes sense that if you can mine more than the other person and finish your cycle first that you get the resulting ore. if the asteroid \"pops\", then that is just bad luck for the slower miner.2) you can already clearly see who is mining which asteroid, simply by observing mining laser activity. i contest that it isn't a difficult thing to do. 3) just because there is a message that an asteroid is already being mined doesn't mean someone has to pay it any attention, or respect."
"first of all, i don't expect a non-miner to understand at all, but i'll try to enlighten you regardless.1 and 3.) this has almost nothing to do with mining in public areas with random people you don't know. i don't care who gets the ore first in those situations, in fact i generally try to mine the same roid as somebody else if i don't know them simply because they are mining my roids and it's a way of staking a claim. this idea is intended for groups of people who are mining together and sharing the profits. their #1 priority is to mine as much ore as possible in the shortest amount of time. mining the same roid is counter productive if this is your goal.2.) of course you can see it. you can see the laser, you can see where it's going. what is usually not obvious is exactly which roid it is hitting. you've got roids in front of it, behind it above below and to each side. depending on which way you're looking at it, it could look like it's hitting another roid in front of it, and it is also difficult to locate the roid you want to mine in space. using the overview you can locate which roid you want, but you can't see if it's already being mined. my system completes the cycle easily, pardon the pun. using my system, (a small icon that is already available for enemies), by simply looking at the overview you can select which roid you want, and can easily tell if somebody is already mining it. with just a little more effort the devs could make it so that you can tell who is mining it at a glance, ie corp member, group member or neutral.and lastly, why do you care so much? not only is this a good idea, but this is just one easily implementable addition in a sea of other additions. did you see the last patch notes? 90% of it was nitpicky stupid stuff, and if you think this is a nitpicky stupid addition, then 1 more won't hurt will it. anything that makes mining easier is good for everybody."
"first of all, try not to make assumptions about what other people do in eve - i'll take a moment to enlighten you.for most of this year, i mine on my industry alt most days i'm online because of limitations in my life placed on my ability to pay the due attention required for the kind of extensive 0.0 pvp i would otherwise be able to enjoy and as i used to do quite frequently. mining is much less demanding on my resources so i can usually get away with it and with some success. often i mine alone, though i'm happy to say that sometimes i don't and the company has been very good.so i think i know what i'm talking about and i don't particularly care for your automatic \"why doesn't anyone understand me?\" attitude based on absolutely nothing other than fobbing off what i've said even before you've begun to make a proper response to it.now, if you read my second point again you'll see that i clearly state that i can (personally) consistently tell which asteroid is already being mined, though i see that you probably didn't understand what i said because what i meant conflicts with what you've gone on to say about what i said - i generally have no problem with working out which asteroid the beam is striking, i don't have the difficulty with it that you've reported.i said that (in my experience) i can tell who is mining which asteroid, simply by observing the mining laser activity - which means both watching for who is using the laser and where the laser is striking. i still contest that it isn't a difficult thing to do. perhaps i'm having a better graphical experience than some other players are. in the case of a gang mining, i would expect some form of gang communication to exist either in chat, eve voice or an external equivalent of it - such as ventrilo. therefore i wouldn't think it too difficult to believe it possible that when confusion in the gang arises about who is already mining which particular asteroid, the most likely suspect could be quickly asked to describe the rock/s they're already mining.another idea that comes to mind, is using a target painter as a laser pointer before asking for a whole ui change. did you consider posting in (or notice) the features & ideas discussion forum before posting your unpolished concept here?your main complaint is that the most sure way to avoid the problem is tedious ...welcome to eve. tried to unanchor a large pos + numerous structures lately?"
"well i would like throw my hat in the ring for the csmeveryone seems to ask opinions and such so here goes:ninja salvager i wouldnt do it but i do think its a \"profession\" in this game, personally i would like either a compromise of something like a timer making wrecks in \"degraded\" wrecks which would be able to be tracked down with a specalized series of probes and launchers the degraded wrecks wouldhave no loot and 80-100% of there salvage intact.low/null sec issues my opinion on this is no matter how appealing ya make this some ppl just wont step outside the gates of high sec its not gonna happen, i would love to see roaming gangs of killable concord floating around as bounty hunters or something interestingthe speed nerf: i believe it was needed but approached wrongly, instead of making one item counter another make it into a give and take aspect, since the 2 pt scrams stop a mwd make it something like 2 points above the ships warp str will kill a mwd, and in turn add some advanced warp stab mods and rig to reinforce the warp str allowing some players who still crave speed to sacrifice something to keep running like a bat outta hell, i don't think nerfs should be straight up road blocks to steer the game but ya know theres some ppl that aren't happy going less then \"ludicrous speed\" and should have the opportunity to work around the speed issueshigh sec issues ganking, high sec ganking shouldn't have insurance payouts your insurance company wouldn't pay your claim if you total you car running from the cops after a heist, i think if concord destroys your ship the insurance is voidlow sec, if ya go into it ya know what to expect, if ya don't, you'll find out damn fast my opinion on that im not throwing my hat in for corp or alliance agendas but i feel i would be an asset to csm and would like the chance to prove it"
"well number one you should show us your ticker as your corp etc. number two, you missed. the instruction on how to apply and where to post is not in this forum. this is not a great way to start considering you have not took the time to read the rules and find out where exactly you apply. also the first idea..ninja salvager. crapthe second. low sec roaming gangs of concord..crap.the rest..crap."
"anchoring lvl 5 prereqs: anchor 400.000 pos modules or 1.000.000 bubbles.jump drive calibration 5 prereqs: make 20.000 jumps with your capital.corporations management 5 prereqs: create 5.000 unique corporations and go and troll on the forums."
"or perhaps something more reasonable like: jdc level = sum((10 jumps completed) and (10 jumps completed) and (20 jumps completed) and (40 jumps completed) and (50 jumps completed))cm = minimum(((count(corpmembers)) * 0.(age of corp in days using 001 as default)), 5)"
"thank you captian obvious. perhaps you should target my spelling or sentence structure next eh?or perhaps leave it with you disagree with my idea."

"having served as an alternate (for an inactive alternate!), i am standing again for election to the csm. for further details on my views, agendas, and character please visit my blogsite:linkage arithron's blogsitealternately, why not read my latest interview, conducted by sam guss at the excellent online e-zine, eve-mag.com:interview at eve-maga quick summary of my platform:i will represent, interact and consider supporting issues from any player, regardless of nationality, alliance, corporation or sphere of play.i will push for the csm to conduct themselves in professional way, in dealings with players and ccp, and for the csm discussions and meetings to be available as soon as possible for all players to view if they wish. additionally, i will be requesting that a more permanent and accessible record of past issues raised and meeting logs etc be developed.i will push for better communication with ccp and from ccp, and encourage ccp to be more forthcoming about changes with better warning periods given.i will interact and discuss (or ask for elaboration of points) issues and ideas with players on a regular (nightly when possible) basis. i will support issues that i see as benefiting the majority of players, regardless of how such issues impact on my in-game characters. i will seek the advice and experience of other players if i do not have direct knowledge of any issue being discussed.i am interested in making low sec more interesting and appealing, having characters that choose to walk the path of evil (crime and other dark pursuits) get better content and opportunities.i have no hidden agendas. currently arithron is an industralist/inventor/missioner/explorer/marketeer. however, i will not be specialising in issues from these spheres alone. i will consider any issue and work at understanding the complexities before making a decision at a csm vote meeting.feel free to ask questions below and i will happily answer them to the best of my ability! take care,arithron"
"this is where i stopped reading. think about what you said and get back to me when you've figured out where you went wrong."
"you can't tell me that a dinner table is a zero-sum game and then bring out a thanksgiving feast. the conditions for classifying it as a zero-sum game become broken. in the case of bringing more players and money to 0.0, neither power or money are zero-sum games. it will create a new zero-sum game until things change again, but locally, it's not zero-sum and the conditions you're saying i'm under in crafting a solution aren't going to hold. non zero-sum immediately implies that it is possible to raise the condition of large alliances and aspiring 0.0 players/alliances/corps at the same time.things won't change again until a new game is defined i.e. next patch."
"it depends on the game you're playing. power is irrespective of what is on the table. there are only so many seats and no action in the game can create more."
"you're going to have to elaborate on the mechanisms and behavior you're referring to.this is probably a half-hearted attempt at best, but might be sufficient to give you an answer. the new income system, which sits below the sov level, represents a large new body of power that can be held. sov still exists above the system and gets its own boosts to value and meaningfulness. if the volatility of the new asset is high enough, it will exist in a power structure largely disconnected to sov mechanics. only through economic relationships between those who have large amounts of planetary income and those who can use it will still exist. what's to prevent an alliance from seeking both the infrastructure and the income? volatility. volatility fragments the big picture into a large number of smaller time domains where the more is better mechanic cannot operate."
"there are three tables. a high sec table, a low-sec[and unconquerable 0.0] table and a 0.0 table.adding more food to the tables does not change the game, because the game is defined by who is sitting at the tables. \"giving something to both sides\" doesn't change power and power is the game. and here is the crux of the issue. the new asset you are devising uses the same sov mechanics to produce. if you want to change the power balance, the mechanism needs to advantage players who are there now as much as possible. you have to incent individuals to go to the 0.0 space and stay there, and if they get knocked out, they need to have the incentive to come back. passive income generation does not do that, especially with the barrier to entry and production rate that you have proposed.large organizations will not fail to pick the low hanging fruit, and it will be low hanging.bull****. more is better always holds true. if you have 10 people and i have 20 then i can knock over and set up twice as many passive income generators. but you have to worry about twice as many people coming and knocking over yours so not only can i do twice as much, but my exposure is cut in half. goodness why do you think alliances are created in the first place. there is no way to get rid of this advantage. it works for corporations in modern economies. but that is because these organizations aren't playing for power, they're playing for money. when you're playing for money, the fact that someone else is where you were and doing something that would not be totally efficient for you is o.k. you have an implicit agreement to stay out of each others way. when you're playing for power, destroying your opponents structure is easy and beneficial. under your theory, nations would never form and wars would never happen. this simply isn't true."
"the crux is in fact the reason why large alliances can get by without worrying about the low-hanging fruit and having to put up with the high turnover rate of assets at the bottom of the food chain. they can focus on their playing field and leave the circus to the carnies so to speak. sure, in systems where it makes sense, they should exploit all they can, but by and large, if they have to run regular patrols of their territory because joe six-man-gang can take out their infrastructure and replace it with his own in less than a day, it won't be worth the effort and drain on manpower.a new volatile asset would be akin to lowering the activation energy of 0.0, exposing everything to a higher number of potential reactions, because a higher proportion of agents will have the necessary energy (pilots). gs largely can ignore the uncoordinated actions of many of the current elements. in a context where that activation energy is low, everyone can chip away at gs on that playing field and gs would be smart to avoid it.the issue isn't what 100 or 1000 pilots can do. for all the pilots in the top three alliances, there are many, many more in losec and small alliances. what lets a large organized entity like gs to operate is coordination. smaller time scales would exacerbate logistics, travel time, and response window issues, which would definitely hurt an organization like gs that depends on their coordination for efficient power projection. this would be a large blow to an alliance like gs, and that's why the infrastructure requirements for utilizing the new wealth should be placed in the hands of gs and co."
"this works as long as you can't shoot anyone. since, in eve, you can shoot people, your supposition fails. and if you can't get them into 0.0 by shifting the balance of power then it won't matter. you have to get them into 0.0, keep them in 0.0 as long as possible, and make sure they come back if someone steps on them. through this mix new organizations will be created and they can be big enough to challenge. but your suggestions don't do that. they don't do that because you are fundamentally ignoring the dynamics involved.you are, at this point, just throwing out buzz words and hoping something sticks."
"funny i have the feeling i'm gaining more and more traction by focusing on the aspects of the solution that break the underlying assumptions necessary for the angle you're working to hold true.gs can shoot people. any large alliance can still shoot people and steamroll large swaths of territory any weekend of their choosing. that's not going to change one bit.however, like a forest fire, the gs's of the game will end up sweeping over the land to clear it out only to find life springing up in their wake. in the current situation, with pos's as the smallest common denominator of 0.0 civilization, the fire is more like a crown fire that wipes out the whole forest and leaves entire regions barren. i still can't make as much money in geminate, and it's been months. i'm having to recapitalize the mineral market all by myself.add life at the bottom of the chain that can survive as the fire burns over them. even if all that's left are ashes, life will spring back quickly. if all it takes is finding the right opportunity and stealing back a bunch of planets, it's immediately worth it to do so and much easier to survive the larger fires."
"and that is why power will not change. you being able to put up passive production units would not change anything, it would just mean that we would kill more things as we rolled through. you need to remove the barrier to entry entirely, you need to encourage people to be there the entire time. otherwise there is no contraction in the amount of space that can be produced from and there is no increase in the amount of people that will be moving to 0.0. or, at least, not enough to matter."
"nah, see, way i see it, getting to 0.0 and then having to grind your ass to the bone while trying to get some pvp victories with the yokals is a surefire recipe for falling behind on the war effort. also, by making the individual production overshadowed by the isk productivity through corp avenues will encourage the one thing that really will change the power balance, more cooperation.grinding has the absolute opposite effect that you want. people end up playing solo and macro-mining or macro-ratting. tde4-h looked less like humans that bots in ffxi. income through grinding dissociates corps and alliances because everyone is out making money as fast as they can \"for the team effort,\" but the best avenues are decidedly through the solo route via mining or ratting.more grinding and more mining will just lead to more solo miners and ratters.a 25m asset that makes cash is a reason to go fight for a place in the sun, or in the quiet expanses of some 120 au wide system. you still have to get it out there. you still have to go pick up the loot and get it to market or find ways to use it. that promotes cooperation and teamwork, assets that above all will change the landscape of 0.0."
"it doesn't have to be grinding, you just have to ensure that the benefactors are online and active, that they lose the benefit as soon as anyone pushes them out and they regain it as they get back into the space.these barriers to entry[as well as the logistics to make it all work] will just make it another way for alliances to make money."
"press button is a mechanic i would agree to as i'm vehemently opposed to grinding and the feeling of playing asteroids with guristas and rogue drones. i'd rather smack local in a hostile system than pretend that killing rats or asteroids is a game.i don't think you can compare an asset that's like playing tennis to the current pos situation. pos's are more expensive, much harder to take down, and don't particularly make a lot of money (most barely paying for the gas.)now, a dyspro moon would be a good example of how an alliance can go out and rack up some passive income fast. problem is, what are the chances of a good moon not having a pos on it? second, what is the likelihood that an expensive moon won't mean a really hard fight? third, dyspro is expensive because of a near monopoly that was held for some time. there just aren't that many to go around.proposed new structure would be much, much cheaper, require no fuel, be easy to remove, and all of them will make nearly the same income.the move by ccp to have the whole moon mineral trade thing didn't work out the way they expected. some moons became gold mines and most became cash sinks. any proposed new system would have a mineral distribution not unlike some of the proposed fixes for moons on assembly hall. much more even, changing over time, and much more diverse. in this way, while there will probably be some trade, most planets would retain their relative value.that is a much different playing field than the current situation on high-end moons."
"yes, and i am telling you its a bad idea, its barrier to entry to too high and the passivity of it allows large alliances to exploit the same mechanic they do with moons."
"let's talk about numbers then.1m100k hp shields100k hp armori was considering something that actually uses the production stream to finish construction of itself...for coolness and to explain the extremely high income for low initial investment.reinforcement....if the tz whine wasn't there.... since this is an expendable asset and nobody is supposed to cry if it falls, no reinforcement is fine by me. either that, or a much different type of reinforcement mechanic. i.e. the device will activate a shield during the same window as it's attacked for the next three days and will be vulnerable when that isn't up. either that or let the defenders choose the time window of \"shield-resting.\" something like that might have more promise than the current system.although, timers lead to fights and fights are good...guns are a better mechanic for enforcing a minimum gang size. that or multi-grid solution, which would be....odd. small sentries to protect from the roaming fast ships. can be tanked by drake...at this point you can say i'm off in space without a clear direction."
"timers do lead to fights, but only if there is a question as to whether or not who will win. excuse me if i have the belief that most of the time, the larger force will easily be able to win. its an important mechanic when dealing with losing expensive physical and power based assets, but beyond that, its not.much better than your previous numbers, 1m isk is dirt cheap, and 100k/100k is roughly 300k ehp, about as much as a heavily tanked rigged plated bs.now the only problem is how the resources get back to the owners. a direct isk or asset injection is the best idea as \"unrealistic\" as that is. without it, then any placement is just going to be \"ping pong\" problem with the people dropping it losing it during their off time. which means it wouldn't be valuable for anyone but an established group who would likely be able to keep it up."
"direct asset injection in the form of some kind of \"mineral formation\" or \"gas mixture\" that is pretty standardized. no real high ends or low ends and all of them have a little bit of everything.volume wise, one industrial should be able to take a day's pay. otherwise it starts getting into the freighter problem and favors those with caps and the ability to protect them/use jump bridges etc.no reinforcement mechanic would probably be a good thing. kind of like hands-off mining. do pvp things in the meantime and watch for those who would trash your basket. scoop loot and just leave the thing there to weather the winds of 0.0. come back. maybe it's there. no crying if it isn't.i don't think it's that unrealistic. it's the perfect kind of tool for harvesting resources that would probably be developed in a real world situation. if oil rigs had a 90% chance of blowing up, they would be made out of cardboard and matar refuse. just add \"nano-technology\" and pretend they can finish their construction by themselves.raw materials can be taken to market, so it's fairly close to isk injection if you can't directly use the goods."
"well i would like throw my hat in the ring for the csmeveryone seems to ask opinions and such so here goes:ninja salvager i wouldnt do it but i do think its a \"profession\" in this game, personally i would like either a compromise of something like a timer making wrecks in \"degraded\" wrecks which would be able to be tracked down with a specalized series of probes and launchers the degraded wrecks wouldhave no loot and 80-100% of there salvage intact.low/null sec issues my opinion on this is no matter how appealing ya make this some ppl just wont step outside the gates of high sec its not gonna happen, i would love to see roaming gangs of killable concord floating around as bounty hunters or something interestingthe speed nerf: i believe it was needed but approached wrongly, instead of making one item counter another make it into a give and take aspect, since the 2 pt scrams stop a mwd make it something like 2 points above the ships warp str will kill a mwd, and in turn add some advanced warp stab mods and rig to reinforce the warp str allowing some players who still crave speed to sacrifice something to keep running like a bat outta hell, i don't think nerfs should be straight up road blocks to steer the game but ya know theres some ppl that aren't happy going less then \"ludicrous speed\" and should have the opportunity to work around the speed issueshigh sec issues ganking, high sec ganking shouldn't have insurance payouts your insurance company wouldn't pay your claim if you total you car running from the cops after a heist, i think if concord destroys your ship the insurance is voidlow sec, if ya go into it ya know what to expect, if ya don't, you'll find out damn fast my opinion on that im not throwing my hat in for corp or alliance agendas but i feel i would be an asset to csm and would like the chance to prove it"

"i am sorry, you mean just because the guys who made you sign nda and paid for the trip to iceland said \"no\" or something along those lines, there is nothing to discuss? i think something lost in translation here man, because there is plenty to discuss! that is the whole point of csm to bring pressure on ccp on behalf of the community - no? not walk away with the tail between one's legs. you see what i have highlighted there? well, the response has been received month or more ago, the discussion took place, and yet, you guys chose not to publish it why? furthermore, there has been way too much \"half-talk\" from csm about it, you clearly guys have bad news to give to eve community from ccp, and yet, there was clear avoidance, or appearance of avoidance on csm and ccp's part when it comes to this issue. what i predict is that ccp simply gave you guys the same brush off as they did us a year ago, with \"it is too much trouble to implement\" and yet we have really proven them wrong in the original thread, and since then they simply ignored it. in my opinion this was and is the issue that 99% of eve community can get behind, and yet, we have \"musical instruments\" - does this not make you shudder? does this not make you appalled? does this not make you angry? basically what i have gathered from s.s and your responses is this: you spoke with ccp and ccp told you to screw off. and you guys were unable to come here and tell us outright so we can follow up with additional pressure on ccp. for the first time in five years i am really upset at ccp, at their covert attempts at manipulation of their mistakes, and at continual subversion that they have exercised on many occasions. it is definitely not the same company that made eve online in 2003, and are not the same people. by not making even an effort to come out and talk to the community regarding the \"dead horse\" issue, and by tying your csm hands when it come to clear, concise, and truthful account about your communications with ccp it proves to me that pretty much all is lost."
"because we had to have the ccp-csm discussions first, then create the minutes, have them approved by ccp and then have the community team post them. anything else would be a breach of the nda. we didn't chose not to publish it, that's stupid to say.you are basically telling me that the csm should not care about the nda and ruin the integrity that csm has, because you want feedback from ccp.i'm sorry, but you are *not* being reasonable. don't even get me started on the musical instruments in ambulation. seriously, i wish that they could just implement this. but hey, i'm not hilmar.but here's the deal:wait till the minutes are out like everybody else who raised an issue or had interest in some of them. the fact that you kept posting here and demanding an update gave you a bit, congratz. but you still have to wait for the minutes. nobody on the csm is going to break their nda just because you want an update.but thanks for proving to me that it was wrong of me to even give you an update on what was going on. i don't think that going to happen in the future like this, when people aren't being perfectly reasonable. but let me once again point out i would love to see this in game. and i'm pretty sure we will some day."
"1) you do not see me being suspicious about the whole affair, and demanding answers as reasonable, especially since the \"ball was dropped\" once before, for whatever reason, and issue ignored, or sent too late or what not?2) lavista, you did not \"give me an update\" specifically, you did post for everyone that something has been received, and we should wait. if you read further, s.s. actually said in so many words that it was \"useless since ccp gave definitive answer\" - from which anyone with modicum if intelligence can glean where it leads, and what is going on. then you came in and pretty much confirmed that \"yea we could talk about i, but why, since ccp already told us .... \"the only reason i received replies from you guys is because i am a pushy bastard, and i pretty much called on csm and ccp to provide answers continuously, for years with ccp, and for months with csm, until someone said, lets shut him up, and throw him a bone. just because i get a bone, does not make me happy, i want the whole steak, or in this case information, every bit of it. no one wants to break the nda, it is the question of why it has taken so bloody long in the first place to go to ccp, we know, we know, clerical error, and then why has it taken months to actually get any news at all... when, bring it up again, silly ****... gets pushed through?! the whole thing with the \"dead horse,\" ccp, csm and the way this been handled is purely kafkaesque manner.anyway, as i said before, you did not respond to me, you responded to all of us, and do not feel bad for a second that when you did the right thing, you might have to feel slightly bad about it later - that is what happens, and what you did unlike so many other csm was the right thing, even if i am shouting at you, and making you feel uncomfortable - i am shouting at csm and ccp, it just so happens you are the guy who does the right thing and talks to the people, so you get the bayonet, you still get my vote later on kiddo. edit: think of me as the guardian or ny times when it comes to the \"dead horse\" issue, only with spelling errors. they are pushy, and obnoxious, but they never blame anyone for doing the right thing, even if they would critizise them for not doing more.hell i would run for csm myself, and give ccp run for their money, but i do not want to sign the nda, or make my name public for the video game."

"you fail at making sense. you know, you don't have to train skills. i mean if it's so boring, or tedious, or whatever you think it is, just don't do it and you won't have anything to complain about. seriously if skill training wasn't so important to this game, i wouldn't get to laugh at all your tears. notice that it's the people with 3, 4, 5, and more accounts that are upset. guess we get to play eve without 50% of the player base being alts, i can't wait."
"i have no alts. i'm not so much ****ed off at the fact that i won't be able to ghost train cald bs 5 so i could use the raven better, i'm ****ed at the fact that ccp is acting like ea. power of 2, 30-d gtc, removal of ghost training, ccp made a plan for this to leech as much money as possible in as little time as possible. also, asking me not to train skills is like asking me not to paint my house because i can't be arsed to watch the paint dry while i could be doing something else."

"*sigh* this is simple really, i promise.to play you pay. pvping is playing, pve is playing, and market pvp is playing.skill training is also playing. prove it otherwise.if you want to get better at any of the above things you have to train skills. don't tell me you don't enjoy seeing \"completion imminent\" on that 30+ day skill. that is playing. if ccp made a game where all you did was train skills, and whoever had the most was best, you'd be playing. if skill training isn't playing, you would stop training as soon as you felt your character is where you want him to be skill wise. if it's not playing, then there is no enjoyment of ghost training that 30+ day skill, and why bother?but i'll agree, ccp's business practices are sketchy. if that is what everyone is \"canceling\" their accounts about, i don't blame them. if it's because they can no longer scam ccp out of cash so that they can train 6 alts while only paying the equivalent of 2 full time, well tbh i don't care and their tears taste so sweet."

"hell yeah!!!!! how many forum posts do we have to initiate just to get something that a majority of players want and all players would benefit from?????????? what is wrong with you people??????i logged on today to start a post almost exactly like akita did, so i was pleasantly surprised to see that im not the only one who was utterly shocked by the sudden end to the only (if not tenable) rationale that one could possibly make against having a skill que.guys, i pay money for this game and i really love it but i find it insulting that your interest in customer service is so low that you would ignore such a vocal request from so many players. if my company did this, we would go out of business long before you guys will. please, this is a detail!!!!!! do it now and let us get on with getting our full money's worth!!!!!!oh, and by the way, just in response to ccp wrangler's post on the previous forum post about this: i have this to say: people log on to play the game, not to change skills. i will log on when i want to play not because i will perhaps play from some whim that will overcome me suddenly when i log on to change skills. if i got something else to do, i will log on, change the skill (pain in the a**) and log off so i can do something like...oh...live my real life!!!!! i have a life. i want to enjoy my life. part of the enjoyment i get from my life is playing eve. however, having to log on just to change skills (or losing training time just because i cant get to my computer to do so) only takes away from my enjoyment of this part of my life.get over yourselves, stop jerking us around and give us the unlimited skill que now!!!!!"

"there is no reason not to have a short skill training queue of 2 or 3 skills.none.i'm constantly having to train - not the skill i want to train - but the one that's going to last until the next time i can log in.one real problem here is if i want to train a new skill. the training times are so short that i can't start one unless i can be on for at least that amount of time.an example here is the learning skills.the best way to train learning skills is to train all your memory and intelligence skills first - because those are the attributes that all the other learning skills use. what that means is - i do not want to be training some other skill. i want to train those skills in that order.the way things are now - i have to schedule even starting to train these skills for a time when i can be online long enough to get at least one of them to a level where i can let it go for a while.the end result - is that i have partially trained skills all over the place.while i'm on - i train my short time skills, then have to switch to some other skill when i have to log off that will last until i can log back in again.waking up at 0200 just to reset a skill is not something i should have to be doing for a computer game.the computer game should fit around my life - not the other way around.prior to the end of ghost training (while i disagree that it was the problem it was made out to be) - yes - i could see the logic in not wanting someone to string together long term skills and not have to log in (i.e. pay for) that character for several months.well - ghost training is gone now - so you can stop penalizing all of us because a few people were doing that.as i said over in the ghost training thread - you'd have gotten vastly less flak about ending that - if you'd accompanied the end of ghost training with the addition of skill queue's.as to the suggestions mentioned - i don't like the idea of the half speed training. why take the trouble to code that? just make it 2-3 skills, the total training time of which can't be longer than some period. that period should be at least a day but you could make it as much longer as you'd like. for people who have to go on travel or for some other reason simply can't login for an extended period of time several weeks might be very helpful.get the idea right out of your heads that being forced to login to change a skill is going to encourage people to play the game. all it does is make people not want to play this game at all.i may login now and again just to check my skills - but if i don't have the time at the moment to actually play - then i don't!logging in and playing is solely governed by my having the time and desire to do so - not having to log in and reset a skill."

"1. bombs should be fire and forget. there should be no reason a bomber should have to stay uncloaked until the bomb triggers.2. range should be selective and have more of an option then 18km. being that up close and personal make for almost no chance of surviving a bombing run. 20km, 30km, 40km should be able to select the flight duration of the bomb.3. cost of bombs?! should be halved at least. between the short range attack, the inability of the pilot to escape in stealth mode while the projectile is in flight, and high cost of ammo makes this a waste of skills to learn. make the stealth bomber a useful ship to use. if nothing else allow for the bomb release and cloak back up with 2 seconds."
"this really needs to be fixed, the stealth bomber using bombs is nearly useless as it stands right now."

"i dont care about ghost training too much, if i play a game, i play it. no need to not pay and train.skill queue would be kinda nice though.reducing training times, hmm. yes, some skills definitely should be decreased in time to train. no, because it just would spam the market with those \"selling 50 million sp char blabla\".in general i would prefer to have the l5 skills a bit less important and long and have the lower skills a bit increased. some l1 are too short, some l5s are kinda too long. but the general overall time for a skill should remain as it is, maybe shortened by 5-10% over all. but it isnt really necessaryikonia"

"eve must be the only mmo game that does not support parallel training of all accounts. since the training model is designed based on real time passing, and thus has huge training time for advanced skills, and incorporates offline skill training to counterbalance the length of the time needed to pass for these skills, we should be given the ability to have all three of the characters that each account can have under it be trainable at the same time (in parallel).this proposal will:a) might stop the deletion of alt accounts under the withdrawal of the ghost-training feature.b) generate immediate income from the character transfers.c) rectify a long-existing grievance against multi-character players."
"actually, without this, i'll probably keep 2 empty character slots until my first one is finished training, which will take about....forever.i'd love to build a new character, but not if it slows the progress of this one.what's the point of having 2 extra slots if you can only develop one character at a time?and my communist attitude prohibits me from taking another account, just to 'enable skill training'.i will not take another account until i've filled all my character slots, but seeing as that will take forever...fully supported!"
"it still comes down to fixing a side effect of the skillsystem, if you take this idea a bit further to allow you to dictate where your training resources go it may help the new players as well.with that i mean with that:1. allow 3 characters to be trained on a single account at normal speed2. allow 1 character to be trained at 3 times the speed (this to accomedate players like me who like to operate from a single identity instead of detaching your ingame self even more by having mulitple characters to enjoy all content)."
"i believe minimum time for all skills lvl 5 is between 22 and 25 years. i can understand somewhat how this would make it easier for the character farmers to operate but at the same time it hinders us casual players. we can't log in both characters at the same time so please let us train them at the same time."
"why not?"
"makes sense to allow all three to train at once. after all, you can't play them all at once, so what's the problem? if people do things ingame that require two characters to be logged in at once, they'll have two accounts either way. i don't see how ccp would lose much by doing this. it might possibly dilute the value of characters sold via the forums...but that affects only players. big deal."
"supporting this. as it has been said, we cannot play two (or three) characters on the same account at once, so for dualboxing (or more) you'd still need other accounts. giving a person the ability to train all characters on their account at once is long overdue."
"a definetely no. smartbombs shall not be made bigger than now. else tacklers are useless."
"tacklers have 20k disruptors right? this would only prevent the use of 2 point disruptors.if you want more than that there is at least 1 ship with a bonus to range on disruptors and faction versions of them to combat faction versions of the smartbombs.heavy interdictors have what range again and infinite point? they were designed to tackle super caps.i don't see how you can be so against it. not a capital pilot myself so not voting but i can't see the arguments as valid either."
"no.large smartbombs are already very powerful. better smartbombs would be horrific news for frigs, drones and citadel torps."
"in other news citadel torps are having their hp almost quadrupled."
"the problem with this suggestion is that a capital smartbomb is a drone/fighter nerf.this alone should be a reason not to go with it."

"hello. the purpose of this thread is to garner attention towards the upcoming eve nerf that will take place in the winter expansion. by posting here and ticking the \"support option, you are forcing ccp to take a further look into what these changes would do to the game mechanics, or at least to be more aware of it, and hopefully respond to the outcry raised by the community.but let me be clear. this thread is not meant to imply that nanos do not need a nerf, or that all of the changes ccp proposes are bad. rather, this is for those of you who feel that ccp is simply going too far in nerfing the speed and mass of every ship in the game, among other things, while trying to sell all of these changes to the community as a batch speed rebalance. here is the original dev blog on the subject."
"ok, now, why in the world would a nerf to the entirety of the game be a bad idea? well first let's look at why ccp thought this would be a good idea in the first place.#1 complaints. that's right, especially since the introduction of polycarbon rigs, there have been a huge number of complaints that certain classes of ships, namely hacs and recons, can simply go too fast, avoid too much damage, and be able to fly with minimal risk, and that this is not fair. personally, i agree. as someone who has flown the nano ishtar/cerb/recon/interceptors a lot, i will admit that the speed of hacs and recons, in general, is imbalanced.#2 physics breaking aspect. ok, so ccp claims that fast ships break their physics engine. is this true? well, it might be at extreme speeds, but i don't want to challenge this claim. what i do want to make clear however, is that speeds of any ship going 15km/second or less, do not break the physics engine in any way. in fact, i lost a 10k taranis to a pos while doing 10k, due to lack of transversal a few weeks ago. that said, it is entirely possible that a 28k ares may be so far beyond the bounds of ccp's physics engine that almost nothing except webs and neutralizers can touch it. i still think it would be more correct to say that ccp never designed counters for these ships, especially considering the sizes of today's grids, and the vast amounts of space that they are able to transverse in seconds.#3 common sense. if these things are true, if you can have an 80 man roaming gangwith an average speed of 4.5km/second, with hacs able to deal insane amounts of dps, speed tank most cruiser/bs class ships, all with minimal risk, especially after the initial grid load, then you have a broken system. while there are ways to fix this aside from nerfs, such as fixing certain ships and adding new ships that specialize in anti-speed, it is certainly easier to simply nerf all of the offending ships.now that we have an idea of why the general community would recognize that the speed of hacs and recons in particular is out of whack, let's look into what ccp proposed to fix this.#1 increased mass and decreased velocity for virtually every ship in the game.#2 nerfing named/t2/faction/deadspace/officer mwds to t1 status.#3 nerfing webifiers.#4 taking 1 of 3 speed variables, mass, out of the game.#5 nerf to overdrives, snakes, speed hardwirings, and skirmish warfare modules.whew. so just to be clear, any ship that ever undocks, will be affected by this nerf.... rather than going through these changes and explaining why each is less than optimal, or just horrendous in some cases, i will say this to all of you, especially ccp.the game mechanics in their current state (tranquility) are probably as good as they have ever been. there are many people that would be perfectly happy with playing the game as it is for years to come. no one person is complaining that for example nano megathrons are overpowered, or that a t2 speed fitted 6.5km/sec interceptor is broken. so why nerf these ships? i have heard ccp devs say before, that the smaller the change, the more desirable it is, when it comes to fixing broken aspects of mechanics. so let's fix these broken ships huh? let's think for a second, straight math. if the average speed of a nano gang were to be changed from 4.5km/sec to 3.5km/sec, the maximum possible speed for interceptors from around 30km/sec to 15km/sec (mind you, this is with 5bn invested in a 15m hull), and the maximum speed of ships such as the vagabond from around 15km/sec to 7km/sec, then i think we'd all agree that that would do most of what needs to be done, to fix current mechanics. it was never your 4km/sec ishtar that you could not kill if you really put your mind to it, it was that 8k rapier, or that 12k vaga, or that 10k machariel, or that 20k ares."
"let's not get caught up with whether this is perfect or not though. this is merely an example of how the few ship classes are broken, can be brought inline without a nerf to eve in general. if you need any more proof, look at tracking, look at missiles. the devs know they've broken these things on their test server, so are forced to come up with a new missile formula even though nobody ever complains about missiles nowadays. and who knows about tracking, there's a 25 page thread that the devs have commented on, with numbers and graphs galore, proving that the nerf will also nerf many other aspects of the game. not to mention the isk/time people have put into things such as deadspace mwds, implants, or command ships. in closing, think about this a bit. that's all i ask. thanks."
"scripted webbers along with a couple of other additions would leave killing nano in the hands of the players...where it should be."
"supporting this, nerf stupid speeds but don't go too far."
"personally, don't really care much about nanos, although speedfits, imo, should be a viable option (although i'd probably say polys/snakes need rebalancing). certain hacs completely rely on this anyway, and are perfectly balanced on current tq mechanics (eg, vagabond). interceptors need their current tq speeds to avoid being suicide machines (what they did to interdictors, for instance*).the far-reaching changes to all ships in eve and all combat, which obliterate entire ship classes and playing styles, however, are the problem. on sisi, there is no reason to fly a interceptor short of producing t2 killmails. most non-sniper hacs are just bad.the massive devaluation of solo tackle bothers me a lot. slowing down all bigger ships by the mwd nerf and direct mass/speed nerfs bothers me even more. total shift of balance which utterly shafts short-range ships which already, on tq, are limited in usefulness is insane. the missile changes on sisi are a joke (as they do nothing to help smaller ships as long as you fit a tp, and prevent you from damaging ships of same size fully without a tp) . the suggestions that people should fit abs for 'speedtanking' (on anything except frigates for solo lol kills) is laughable, and only applies to killing solo targets.current iteration of sisi and seeing they've failed to change anything meaningful is a major let-down (and there were good suggestions even in the flame-ridden feedback thread).basically, ccp ignored all important feedback, and just decided to pursue their own vision of 'new eve combat'. *tq mechanics, gistii b + poly sabre meets artycane (and artillery really has utterly horrible tracking). result: 20s later, 35 mil worth of easy loot. i don't live in 0.0, but i don't understand people who'd use a 100 mil dictor which is such a horrible deathtrap."
"i agree with op. there are a few things that could be done to mostly eliminate ludicrous speed that would not have such far reaching consequences to eve pvp as a whole. i actually think eve is very close to well-balanced right now, so almost any change is going to be bad."
"op is obviously correct. supported."
"/support lets not nerf the fun."
"why ask for a vote if you dont accept nay voters?i disagree, recons seems very solid in taking over gank pvp but with far larger risk then nanos do as it should be.a concern i have is interceptor survivability though."
"i'm not a fan of the current nano nerf. speed tanking as a whole as well as un-related ships (blaster boats) are changing (bordering on extinction) when only a few changes need to be made to poly rigs and snake implants. a serious re-think is needed."
"i think it has something to do with the fact the missions were made before t2 battlecruisers and t3 battleships. i might be wrong but if not then it is simply an oversightfor the sake of shooting rokh's abaddons hyperions and maelstroms i support"
"i'm pretty sure an overview of npc ship types, roles, and effects is needed, and this should be a part of it."
"in fact a ground-up review of the way ratting and missioning is structured is urgently required."
"tier2 bc need adding as well."
"/signwhat makes eve a lil unicolored is the never changing environment. i would love to come to a place that changes. personally id love to see a situation like a foreign race from a far distance galaxy wants to invade our galaxy and should turn the so beloved hi-sec into a partially fatal and dangerous area so taht corp claimed systems get the chance to become an island of safety deep somewhere in space. that would be great. but i dont think that the game engine would give a chance to do something that brings more variability into the world.non competitive games are kinda vanishing from the market. i hope that ccp makes eve more competitive than it is right now."
"no."
"hehe, nice idea. problem is, that those players doing escalations then are nothing but cannonfodder. of course i would love to have more chances to pvp and i would prefer that all of eve is pvp area fully. but since the game engine isnt really developed for pvp this would just bring problems and would be kinda one-sided.in general: pvp in eve is in comparison to other games a bit boring. pirates only attack when they have a safe win, else most flee. that brings up those gankings, and suicide gankings from lowskilled players with just the wish to post a kill somewhere. high quality 1:1 exist maybe in the dreams of some developers but not ingame. as long as it is like that, it should remain as it is. i prefer pvp but not by being ganked when ever possible."
"all that will happen is lowsec ones will get declined/ignored."
"training is playing. if you want to play you should pay."
"how do you make the thumbs up and down ?just wanna qoute dennis leary: \" stfu next !\""
"you are correct i only have 29m sp and have been playing every day i'm off work since making my charicters. just because you are a new player do not think you can not do anything."
"it is annoying to see the \"service ? pay\" argument all the time, when in the real world, there is also some counter-exemples.in france, \"mobicarte\" (and others) cards permits to emit/receive phone calls, and have a number phone, for a limited amount of money. but if you use all the emit credits or don't use it, you still keep your number phone and the capacity to receive calls with, for six months, without having to pay anything more (after 6 months you have to pay, or more earlier to be able to emit).it is unfair about all others persons who pay a monthly subscription to emit and receive phone calls, isn't it ?no, this is business. this motivates to buy new credits.eve online did this too. we paid to be able to play, but if we stop, we still have some skills points, but not able to play, do missions, etc... so this motivated to return to eve online after a small break.ccp decided to retire it instead of doing a compromise, and did a really bad communication about it, calling implicitly all users of this maybe \"unintended\" feature like cheaters.sorry but this is difficult to accept that.if i remember correctly (i can be wrong), ccp say that after the account is expired, the skill point progression will stop within 3 days. it is possible to do a compromise of the suppression of this feature as the infrastructure is online, like stop it but after 15/20 days. not unlimited, make more difficult to do some abuses, but this keep the capacity of eve to remotivate players to come back.because you \"play\" and have fun when you see the progress bar of a skill gain a nano-pixel ?curious definition of \"playing\""
"excuse me? my first account dates back as early 2004. (messed up attributes, abandoned.)this account is from 2005. i've quit eve a total of 3 times (including this time). i'm anything *but* new, so you should probably get your facts straight before poastin, k?"
"in all honesty i think it is fair for ccp to stop providing service to unpaid accounts, however they should realise why there are so many alt accounts; the limitations of the skill system. or in effect the silly long real time it takes for skills to progress. thus forcing people who like to enjoy all content of the game into having multiple accounts."
"and everything in eve revolves around team play, again to promote multiple accounts."
"not really sure how this works, but..i have ran a corp for about 3 years now, and one thing that has seriously annoyed me about eve. and i have no clue if others have this same frustration, but if so i'd like to see it brought up to ccp. or if not maybe an answer so i won;t be so annoyed.i'm ceo, and i recruit someone. i give this person a role, and this person then steals. i now have to put up with him/her for 24 hours before i can boot them because he had a role.another issue, i recruit someone and they happen to be in space. they start acting like idiots, or something, and i have to either hunt them down and kill them, wait for them to log or dock before i can kick them.my question is why? as ceo i shoudl have the power to kick anyone from my corp at any time for any reason. i should not have to wait 24 hours, i should nto have to wait till they dock, i should not have to have a vote if they have alot of shares. as ceo i should just be able to kick them out.why i can't this has frustrated me for years. and i have never found a legit answer as to why, just the ceo, can;t boot at will.what do the rest of you think?"
"a: corp theft: don't be so trusting.... that's your responsibility... not ccp or anyone else. 24 hour timer is not going away either.b: i was under the impression you could kick any one member as long as you had them in your address book and right clicked there name. so you'll have to wait for confirmation on that bit."
"you can't kick someone in space due to obvious exploit being obvious (war, kick them right before they get shot, other side gets concordokkened)"
"yeah... makes perfect sense....not.<shakes head>"
"im kinda new to here, my first post in this forum.what i miss is some kind of ammo-setup-menu. since weapons require a lot of swithing ammo some kind of menu, where players can define their own preferred setup for ammo config would be great. how do you think about that?ikonia"
"umm... i really don't think that is a reason to not let them."
"it wasn't a reason per se, it was a counterargument. but at present the rule is that no cloaking device bonus of any kind means no black ops bridge - eas is hardly the first ship that should be changed for."
"i ran in the last session on what was essentially a \"no platform\" platform. i think we've all learned a great deal this session about what the council actually is and i've personally learned a great deal about when and how to present issues and what to expect. that being said in this round of elections i am actually going to have a platform which will include a few items which i find to be of some importance.curb the stagnation of 0.0 - while my alliance is going to do their part to spice things up i think there's a lot to be said regarding the current state of affairs in 0.0. massive powerblocs, stale gameplay, lag, boring and tedious pos mechanics, and a distinct lack of benefit as anything other than a merit badge all rank high on my list of things i find to be inherently broken in 0.0 today. i'd decided on a tiered approach to this issue as it occurred to me that the best way to make headway with this problem was to obtain some consensus. many of the \"solutions\" proposed in the last council to some of the problems of 0.0 warfare were rather shortsighted and proposed seemingly out of ignorance of the realities of the current state of affairs. because of this i proposed to ccp that we establish a pair of roundtables at fanfest focused specifically on 0.0. one for those actively engaged in 0.0 warfare and another for those who do not currently. the goal is to try to glean from those who are currently engaged those things that they like and dislike about the existing system, and to obtain from those who do not partake, some sense of why and what could be done to improve that. the basic idea being that i am just one man with one man's skewed opinion and ideas, and i felt this was the best mechanism to obtain input from a wide variety of people, each having different opinions so that we may work together to chart a better future for a game we all love. i am happy to say that this proposal has been accepted and i will be working to craft a series of proposals from what i hope will be a fun and successful dialogue with others at fanfest. i also hope to see a greater variety in representation of the 0.0 alliances in the next council.continuity - it is my belief that having a few of us from the original council carried over to the second can help to alleviate many of the growing pains we experienced in this first iteration of the csm. i'm not sure who else is running at this stage of the game but i know that many are not and i believe that a mix of new and old blood will ensure the most optimal configuration. being on the council does require a bit of getting used to and i think it is best for us to have a few council \"veterans\" return for the 2nd go-round.customer service/pr - i believe that ccp and all its employees are well-intentioned. i also believe that there are times where they could use a bit of outside guidance in understanding the perspective of their customers. there are a number of cases where simply communicating better would make people feel a lot less emotional about certain things and i have been and will continue to try to offer some guidance in this regard.those are my 3 biggest ticket items. i want to stress that while my personal focus is towards pvp and 0.0, that does not mean i have no compassion for players in other aspects of the game. i think those who have any concern in this regard can take a look at my voting record to see that i was in favor of many of our industrial/\"carebear\" proposals. i believe personally that a good council member should be objective and focus on what's best for the game itself, rather than selfish personal motivations. i have quite a bit more to add but i'll reserve that for a second post."
"so who is darius johnson? i am sean conover, a 30 year old computer forensic analyst for a major company based in new jersey usa. my work for years has involved leading and engaging in internal investigations for large corporations running the gamut from employee misconduct to the commission of crimes.i am currently the ceo of goonfleet, the largest corporation ever to have graced this fine game. goonfleet is also the executor corp of goonswarm who happens to be the largest alliance ever in eve. i don't want to delve into a resume of accomplishments, but suffice it to say managing a 3000 member corporation and a 6000 member alliance takes a great deal of effort and organization. goons are involved in every single aspect of eve, and it is our responsibility as leaders to ensure that their path to \"fun\" is as clear and unobstructed as possible. this is often a great challenge.i happen to love eve online. it is the greatest mmo i have played since i was a member of the lut guild in ultima online. i believe in a sandbox-style pvp environment and no other competitor exists, being that uo lost its way a long time ago. i believe i offer a semi-unique perspective in that my primary focus is on preserving the balance in the sandbox between risk vs. reward. i believe that the \"spirit\" of eve must be preserved at all costs.\"but darius, you're a goon and you'll already get a billion votes i'm not wasting my vote on you\". that is the argument of a man i'd like to call the cynic. the reality is that you should cast your vote for the person you feel will serve the best, regardless of any preconceived notions you may have on the amount of support they will receive. i expect much greater turnout this cycle and more hotly contested election and i will require the support of as many of you as possible in order to continue our fight to preserve and improve this great game."
"1: what is your stance on the current implementation of the skill system (like the turning off of ghost training and what not) and do you have any suggestions to put the storm that's raging as a result to rest.2: do you have any prospects or solutions to also help sort of the issues surrounding high sec space... like the war dec system... and the intentions of keeping the industrialist strong and ever growing in high sec all the while to encourage movement to 0.0 space without the ever ending loop of \"greifing because we want to make them move to 0.0\" but ignoring the side effect of squashing any particular chance of such a thing from taking place due to continued harassment. and of course maintaining the freedom of the sandbox environment.ps: i'm likely to vote for you anyway : o ) but i don't see this discussed at all.. other than large rants.... i'm curious as to your viewpoint.oh and to everyone else... not all goons are alike.; o )"
"weren't you in the first csm?"
"didn't you read his post?: o )ps: that's a yes by the way...."
"hello, i hereby announce that i will be re-running for the second cycle of the csm. my main priorities remain small-scale 0.0 pvp and game balancing in order to achieve greater fairness. you can find my idea, background and programme on my campaign site. you can read about my ingame history in eon#13, if you are lucky enough to have a copy of it. eve-mag.com has recently made an interview with me, you can read it here."
"i am throwing my hat into the ring. if nothing more, it will provide the players of eve a source of great amusement. feel free to ask any questions below and i'll do my best to answer them. i'll field any topic relating to eve. edit: i suppose i should include a short platform. i won't write nearly as much as i did last time, but here are the sticking points, in terms of priority.more communication: the past week has been a good example of what we should expect from ccp. i aim to do what i can to keep it that way.limiting entrenched interests: there are a lot of entrenched interests in eve, from large alliances, to wealthy production asset holders, to highly skilled players. all of them need to be taken a peg down. when the differences between players are lower, hegemony can succumb to competition without it, stagnation will end up ruining the gamecompetition in all sectors: i want to make sure we as the csm promote systems that foster continual competition in all aspects of eve. you should not be able to rest on your laurels after attaining the top spot without someone else coming and taking it from you. to ensure that everyone, no matter when they start, has the opportunity to become a powerhouse."
"hi goum! haven't seen you around on the forums much in a while.here's a question:how much of a threat should a gatecamp be; how necessary should a scout be for travelling when otherwise alone, and how easy should it be to mwd back to a gate in the event of a ****storm on the other side?"
"1. it depends on how big the gatecamp is. for the majority of ships, a significant gate camp should be pretty much certain death. if we are playing a game with non-consensual combat[and i think we are], then landing on the same grid as a bigger and more coordinated force means you're going to take losses. if there is only one of you, \"losses\" pretty much means that you're toast. the only ships that should stand a reasonable chance of running a significant camp are force recons, covert-ops, and blockade runners. that doesn't mean getting back to the gate is out of the question.2. it depends on where you are. if you're deep in hostile territory then a scout should be necessary if you're a small force. if you're in friendly territory then it should be less necessary. this dynamic is more a result of player actions than it is of anything inherent in the game through, and i don't think it will be changing any time soon. 3. it depends on how specialized the gate-camp is. if they've got recons and inties, you're probably not going to make it. or, at least, one of you isn't going to make it. i doubt this will change much pre-patch to after patch, nor should it[there are really nasty ways of making a camp that is, more or less, impossible to run without a cloak, or to even get back to the gate, without relying on the other side messing up(17km web+ 34km scram w/ ~5000 scan radius is possible atm)].eve is a dangerous place, and gatecamps, being an entities ability to enforce its terms on another's travel is important to ensuring combat occurs. everyone has to get somewhere sometime, and i think that that should difficult and should usually entail shooting people."
"don't forget to add my issues to the list:factional warfare complex spawn mechanicslack of focus and goals in factional warfarebreak mission monopoly, obtaining standing through different meansstanding recoveryskill queue and 30 day gtc now that ghost training is gonesee mail and internal communication."
"the problem with the hauler is that you have to get it out there and back, as well you aren't informed indirectly when its destroyed. i think its much better to actually put the assets directly into your hold/account, even if that is in low-sec/empire.if you have to leave it and come back, then that seriously advantages large alliances, since only they have the assets to protect these things for periods of time. that is why i was harping on the fact that the profit has to be made immediately. without it, large entrenched organizations gain more production from the ability, and if you want to shift power away from them that production ability has to be even for all individuals."
"one of the things i'm also putting on the docket are decoupled structures for markets etc.offline presence in something other than a station. market structures especially. you can log in a big empty system, but you can't for love or money sell something in 0.0 without owning the station or finding a friendly alliance/npc station.cargohold size of the device should be small, a few hours. that kills the income stream when players aren't around, but is still much less grind than mining etc.market structures and the interbus might be a workable solution that's very close to free delivery.as primary consumption takes place in 0.0, market structures would cut the need for empire markets out of the loop for these goods. anchorable structure with a maximum capacity (not station) and a goods deposit/retrieval system that doesn't involve docking. sentry guns from hell that respond to any attacks of any kind. can place orders just like a regular station market. limit one per system or so."
"interesting, but it kills the primary function of sovereignty, which is to serve as that logistical and power control structure.the solution to your problem is to try and start a utopia like the goons failed to do with the free trade zone, or like cva is kinda doing[the problem being that no one wants to live there less than that they have bad policies].being able to enforce these policies via stations is what makes 0.0 a reasonable game, i don't think circumventing that is a good idea, even if i think its a good idea to provide pressure against entrenched organizations.i mean, we want new entities to come, gain power and cooperation and build stations right? any hard assets should only be means to take space rather than to ignore the way that power is handled."
"think i had a palinean slip. not anchorable. constructable i mean. requires sov. like a much cheaper version of a station minus everything except the market and storage capabilities. add neutrally aligned guns to enforce your free trade zone.let the maximum broker fees go a little higher. maybe up to 10%. owning alliance would be well served to put it out in the boonies so that their own activities won't interfere with the profitable trade.there are times when you wish, more than anything, that you could do the trade in 0.0 and not have to deal with going to empire, even if it meant trading with an enemy. the structures would be useful in that respect too. sling a jump freighter or rorqual through. pick up/drop off stuff under cover of massive sentries. jump out.can trade with everyone in 0.0 without opening up the station. can make money off of trade even from enemies and passers by. increasing volume always makes prices better. well oiled economies are better at building shyt for pvp."
"why not just have limited access docking rights that you can assign? [cant we do that already?]so if you want anyone to be able to use the market, you just turn the market on public and let people dock and use it[but not store items, repair, etc]though it might be logistically easier to erect a new structure."
"yeah sure. even a renting system with a mechanic for eviction aka jettison all their shyt out the hatch. add a statistic for eviction rate to let people judge if the owner is likely to exploit them. lots of stuff could be done. cheaper would be good. limited capabilities, but much cheaper than an outpost to drive development of more infrastructure for supporting neutrals. might even spawn an alliance business of taking over remote systems to put trading/docking systems down and reap the income without worrying about the local influx of neuts.as it stands, not really a good way to open your systems to neuts without reducing security. no real guarantee for alliances that things won't go sour and no great way to deal with the problems. access that can be enforced would solve a lot of the problems that are introduced.end up saving a lot of trips to empire for a lot of people and provide the two things most essential to playing in 0.0."
"i was just saying that i don't think that we need a new structure to do that, we just need more control over existing outposts. is there any reason why we would have to use a new structure i would love to hear it.i think that the \"free trade\" model has a lot of merits. i know a lot of people have tried it, with some success and some not. [big blue, cva, and ftz are the largest that i am familiar with]. i think the cva model has the most merit from a security standpoint[everyone is neutral until they aggress anyone for a illegitimate reason, at which point they are set red and kos to anyone who cva and anyone who wants to shoot them]. the ftz model is too hard to administer, and the big blue model is too prone to losing combat effectiveness]do we have a list of what we would need to add to stations to more easily allow this sort of activity?separate permissions for dockingall station activities.rentingwith each one allowing a charge to be modified from 0 to fully blocked for all entities.[you would need hundreds of slots each]. as well, to allow contract type enforcement where, so long as the station does not change hands, someone can buy rights for a period of time[for an individual or corporation for a set rate] and have that contract enforced. you would needrented timed hangar access. where-by hangar use is limited per item in the same way a can is. if you don't remove the item after x amount of time where x is a variable set per corporation by the owners the item is confiscated. the ability to pay for more hangar time to the owner of the stationetc etc etc.the contract system, so long as it was enforcible, could provide a very easy vehicle for negotiation and sale of these rights.e.g. lets say you have an owner and a possible renter.the owner puts lists his price as 1m/day +1 isk/hp repair. so if you want to use the service you pay a flat rate plus more for each repair. then the buyer can accept that contract for say, 30 days, it gets sent to the owner. and once both have clicked \"agree\" the station itself enforces the conditions.fake edit:have you come around to my thinking regarding how your anchorable asset generator has to get assets back to the owners?"
"if the assets go back to the owner in their own space, that means a trip to empire to do something with it and also brings empire into the loop if you don't have a friendly station somewhere.the isk method would be a little too artificial. rats are already very artificial. i like shooting drones more than rats simply because the income feels meaningful.extra market infrastructure would probably be the easiest solution that would be realistic and would close the loop inside of 0.0 for the most part.building an outpost just to support trading or housing for the neutral traffic would be a very large investment. a slimmed down market structure would present something that could be fielded away from capital systems without as much risk and would allow the owners to tap into the revenue and production stream without getting their hands all the way into the cookie jar.on the flipside, such slimmed down structures might present a stepping stone on the way to full outpost (prefer calling them stations...makes 0.0 sound like a tourist destination for davy crockett) or station capture.think ccp is probably considering something to that effect already, albeit via the pos system. probably not markets, but for offline presence.in truth a simple module for depositing goods in a common neutral site is all that's needed. contract system can take care of the rest."
"makes sense. but you're going to have to have some sort of docking mechanism. otherwise item transfer is going to be a pain.true, but i think the downsides that you have to go somewhere else to make use of them[say they get put wherever your clone is] is easily outweighed by the advantage that large alliances can't get the same efficiency boost in hauling protection that they can with moons over small alliances. as well, it reduces over all the effort required to maintain the systems.make them \"autominers\" that automatically mine the roids in a belt[only anchorable in low-sec and 0.0, and/or attacking them never flags anyone] would make it even more so, since there are few refining and production slots empire auto-miners would be able to refine and produce in the same station while 0.0 station holder would need to move the assets at some point to effectively bring them to market."
"what if you could turn it all almost directly into t1 ships and loot?i'm tossing around the idea of having a very fast responding production system based on the same kind of self-assembling structures. as a counterpart on the high end, structures that can produce faction-esque bpc's and are much less efficient with the loot, but produce \"shinier\" things.imagining an anchorable structure (safespot-able) that you add a few hours of planetary goo to and it finishes itself off into a low level form that's capable of churning out meta and t1 goup that's directly useful for pvp etc.not a well rounded out idea, but basically something where the lowest common denominator of 0.0 access is that you invest ten-million cleverly and within a few hours your outfit becomes a cloud of zerg with ships upon ships to burn :-)upgrade paths would be nice and cool, but initial production ramping should be of a fast pace that makes entrenched infrastructure unnecessary and provides the necessary ships to try zerg-rushing against the neighbors and prepare for sov level combat.have a feeling large alliances, aware that t1 is not the best way to go with capships on the line, would be better served by more quality goods. in an environment where patrolling is involved, these quality ships are less useful and more a liability due to intermittent zergling attacks.admittedly, don't have it rounded out, but that's what i've been throwing around."
"then its only good if you're being attacked[since you need to get ships out there you already have one] have a place to store them [which means they are just like minerals anyway or you have a pos, something we are trying to get away from neeeding]. and still have to find a way to protect them with these assets as someone runs you over.i don't think directly into ships and loot will work, unless you're tuning it directly into ships and loot at a station of your choosing. it would also cut into tech 1 ship producers profits[who run on thin margins already] and so could only be reasonable if there was some other production system implemented that would allow production with competition.i think its too heavily slanted towards organizations that already have stuff in the area. i mean, do you know how much fun goonswarm would have with something like that? we have carriers dedicated nearly entirely to bringing frigates back to the front lines so that goons can get in them once they get blown up.now you want to give us cruisers and frigates et all with even less logistic work? something that even our small gangs can use? yea, i don't think that is conductive to the general power balance in the game.naw, they would do it both. if there was a fight on established alliances would zerg the **** out of whatever they could, anyone that wasn't podded would get back in a ship as fast as possible and have it out. a ship in the fight > a better ship 10 jumps out.fake edit: i was working hard to get that plug in."

"yeah, i agree. those words were insulting. when someone who has to get up to go to work sets his or her alarm to change a skill in the middle of the night, they're not going to settle in for some eve time. i've heard of quite a few people doing that.but ccp is solidifying their position and reputation as spinmeisters. i've been in eve almost 2-1/2 years and i've about had it. i cancelled nine accounts (well, eight, because one is on a gtc thanks to another ccp stupidity -- bugs in the credit card processing, an issue widely reported in the forums). they will all be reactivated after they suspend, but after varying periods calculated to cost ccp some money."
"there are a couple viable tactics that can make use of the stealth bombers as a bomber:- limited numbers of hostile- bombing drone/fighter blobs- suicide bombing (you can launch more than one bomb with your ship before dying too!). go at it with 2 or 3 bombers so not all have to die and you have the recipe for a nifty battlefield cleanup. alternatively, one of the bombers can carry a lockbreaking bomb to allow the others to escape, it now becomes a question of timing.overall i agree though with your first point: fire and forget. cloaking should not hamper the ability of a bomb to deal damage.the issue now becomes that your ennemies have basically no chance of getting back at you considering your lack of cloaking duration penalty and minimal signature.also, have you tried using an ab instead of a mwd so as to minimize your signature while getting away, x5 locking time because of a mwd doesn't help... that and put some tank modules, it is quite easy to quadruple your effective hp if you can be bothered to fit for it. this puts you in the same position as a dictor pilot.the range issue i don't necessarily agree with, it's a bomber, not a sniper. this is debatable. give a longer flight duration and your targets have more time to leave too, so you'd end up having to get up close anyway.the last point i disagree with. while bombs are indeed terribly expensive, they are one of the few area of effect damage available (with smartbombs and dd), the others all have their disadvantages (one has very high cap cost and limited range, the other requires a titan) but on a damage dealt to isk ratio, they're not bad at all considering they have an immense alpha and a huge area of effect.overall, i agree that stealth bombers need looking into, though."

"i believe 50% is too drastic. however, i would support a 5-15% reduction in training times. this would allow some of the newer players to catch up to experienced in their chosen specialization. before you go asking how it allows newer players to catch up i will make it simple. char a is 4 years old and has maxed out all e-war skills.char b is new and wants to go e-war.char a is off training something else while char b maxes out his e-war skills 15% faster than char a did."

"as a jf pilot myself i don't see the point in this. the only dangers in low-sec or 0.0 cynos is to the cyno alt itself. for a jf jumping to a friendly station (npc) there is no risk. the only time a jf can be killed is the following:1) using gates in low-sec to reduce fuel consumption (lol yes some fools actually do it).2) jumping into a system with no station and getting jumped3) undocking and getting ejected outside docking range, then an infini-point heavy dic prevents you from jumping.4) being bumped out of docking range while waiting for the session timer to change after jumping into a system.all of these can be avoided by using common sense, and if you do the worst case scenario is that your 4m-isk cyno alt gets killed while your 4b isk jf docks safely. after that just undock, warp to 0 and jump into high-sec. nothing can stop you once you are in warp to the gate... unless you ctd when clicking on the gate. the latter actually happened to me once but luckily there were no pirates... very stressful!part of me wants to agree with the op just so i can save my cyno alt and jump without worrying about local, checking for pirates before jumping, choosing the best station for undocking, etc, etc, etc... on the other hand using a jf is very safe. hell i remember having to use a freighter to 0.0 and low-sec and yet i didn't complain. just be happy we got jf from ccp and stop whining about being 100% safe."
"historically eves economic focus for market movement has been on the direct production and trade of player made and mined materials for other players consumption.after looking through the dated, but still relevant first quarter economic newsletter which was released this week i feel there are some growing issues with the model which might want to be addressed in new ways. both from a standpoint of virtual economic growth and game play enrichment.given that only four percent of the character population in eve was in a state of continuous production of goods we may be faced with the following condition that it was only profitable for four percent of eve to be in a state of sustained manufacturing. if we make an estimate that between fifteen to thirty percent of these industrialist were not producing goods for the market, but were producing for internal alliance, corporation, or self use to replenish stock piles, fuel expansion, or missioning we are left with only 3.6 to 2.8 of eve finding it profitable to be producing and selling to market all the time.what id like to propose to help such a situation if it exist, and to add to the enjoyment of the game, is a new way to convert the stored purchasing power of isk cash to longer term investments that would help to make room for greater development and complexity of the eve economic model with the development of a planetary asset system along with a revamping of the eve npc trade goods market.a planetary asset system would consist of a way to buy a lot of land or a production facility on a specified planet that produces a commodity. the types of commodities should be based on those which currently exist in the npc trade goods market.the idea would be that a character in good standing with the faction or corporation which governs a specified planet gives a character the ability to purchase a virtual asset from them. this assets price is determined by the commodity it produces and in what amount. the asset is taxed weekly based on its profitability and the characters standing with the fraction or corporation that holds sovereignty over it. asset should produce the same commodity as the sovereign corporation supplies in the npc traded goods market. additionally by investing significant isk and resources into the asset, over time the character may increase its productivity and worth. but the amounts of time, isk, and resources in the form of other npc trade goods to do this should vary by the planet and randomness. asset development should also be a long term goal taking much higher amounts of isk and resources to increasingly develop, with a rising tax rate and upkeep expenses to match. an assets rating should not be done on a level system but instead by a less quantified indicator. with an efficiency/development rating that goes from 0 to 100, and it should be an estimated rating as far as players are concerned as this will introduce a real world like risk mechanic and make the appraisal of assets more subjective to individuals own perception of its worth and knowledge of how to profit from the produced commodity.a stagnate system of level based prices should be avoided for an active trading market with healthy volatility based on changing conditions with the asset and linked with supply and demand for the commodity it produces on the open market."
"in my view this opens up a whole other area for economic opportunity, but stays in line with eves theme. assets also make for a more natural place for ccp to take isk out of the economy that missioning and over mining dump in with a mechanic that can fight inflation and deflation and bring players an enjoyable new challenge. i would also strongly encourage that as little new art assets, and other visual resources be used for this, and that it blend as seamlessly into the existing game as possible with a simple interface which stresses the raw figures. but random common events that would affect a commodity, such as floods for wheat, slave uprisings, or industrial accidents, should be added.a factor besides the economics of owning an asset is the re-shaping of the npc trade goods market this can usher in. it would make it easier to introduce mechanics that instead of artificially limiting the npc trade goods profitability, it would instead make real fundamental and technical analysis of the markets possible and allow those whom do research to profit from pure hauling and trading in a new way. it also introduces new levels of risk and reward, along with laying down market mechanics for things such as stocks and futures trading which the player base or ccp could expand upon. but most of all it adds another milestone which players can work toward. even if profitability from owning an asset was a somewhat lower percentage gain then straight trading after the taxes, improvements, and upkeep for the asset are paid, i think players would still invest. the idea of owning land, or a factory, or a landfill even is a draw. it would give players and corporations another tangible thing outside of bigger ships and net isk worth to develop around."
"planetery based interaction (including some of what is mentioned in your post) has been on ccp's 'to-do' list for quite some time.i do like the thought of the efficiency system you are talking about tho - but i wonder how you will get around the isk faucet issue. yes, you spend money initially (and continually to upgrade), but surely people wouldn't bother unless it was profitable, and as it's a continuous income the profit will either not be high enough for people to bother, or too profitable causing isk to flow into the economy that wasn't there before.if that can be balanced, it would be a great addition, but i'm not sure how that is going to work to make it worthwhile for people to stop trading with the secondary market and invest in property instead.gets a thumbs up for raising the issue tho"
"well to be honest, this is really a first step. to properly address the isk inflation and deflation issues requires work on ccps part, and them allowing the market to be what it should, unpredictable and based on the sways of bullish and bear sentiment toward it. adding what acts as a real estate sector to the market helps quite a lot to add volatility.a next step would be putting in place a stock and futures market. i have read ccps stance on the subject, and can see their point, which was the concern wed have only a system that makes a select few ultra rich in isk. but my reply to that is, that is real life, and what people love about the markets. the overwhelming majority of people whom enter into the market lose their initial investments, yet they try several times, with the same results. however the markets are still there, and growing.i believe ccps stance from an eve designers view was completely correct, if they were worried about fairness. however like what happens so often with a programmer mindset, they did not see what the end user was actually looking for here. instead they evaluated the situation as a problem for them to solve or consider. i.e., they were thinking how do we make a proper securities market. the simple answer is, you dont, and you simply make a market platform. peoples market sentiment and what they will bid or offer at is what makes a market. people do not want a 'fair' market, they want to try and be that slim majority that flourishes and gets rich. as someone whom works in the technical side of the electronic futures industry i was guilty of this myself several times when i first started out.but the securities market is another [idea] post for another time.the real way this specific step helps is restrained investment and productivity, something not truly in the mining and industrial side. for example, say wheat is the hot product, everyone starts buying up wheat assets, developing wheat assets, driving the wheat npc trade good up. then, pop, billions and trillions of isk lost on a bubble burst. even more so as your formerly billion isk worth asset is now considered overvalued in the extreme. you have to sell it at a monstrous loss because its development upkeep cost, and tax base is completely towering over what it is now worth. but so are every other characters leading to a natural market collapse and a great deal of isk leaving the eve economy for good. even worse will be if you are unable to sell the asset. your stuck holding and keep paying the upkeep and taxes, or do you let it downslide and loose more, possibly even foreclosure? the risk factors here can make for some very interesting market dynamics.it does not cost you anything to store stock piles of goods in eve. you simply sit on them till the market is back up. it is a factor for why the economic model has problems similar to certain industries in the real world. however here to hold onto your investment it does cost you isk. so we finally have a dynamic for bubbles and crashes along with booms that do have proportional effects to bottom line. and ccp through a little work can use that to correct inflation and deflation. not by playing god, but by making sure the market model booms and crashes with what traders and speculators do when they go to extremes."
"you mentioned that only 4% of players are in continuous state of production, but you didn't mention how using planets as factories would solve that problem. and more importantly, why is 4% of the total population doing continuous production a problem in the first place?secondly, everybody got lots of money, as soon as ccp makes planets a tangible asset, it'll be all purchased up. you haven't stated how a piece of land would be used to turn into profit. it's like that stuff you brought off the late night infomercials, ya just gotta have it but not use it.my thumb is down because planetary interaction for the purpose of production is useless, won't change the overall percentage of manufacturers in the game. no reason to own a planet either. it'll be another form of isk sink."
"i'm going to stop you right there. no reason to post another thread about stock market or mineral reserve. simply because there is already a stock market, mineral reserve trade, etc. they're all third party corporation/software and i do believe that ccp stated that they wish that the market is player driven, this part is already achieved and no reason for them to get involved."
"stupid comment tbh."
"personally i like the idea, however a few questions maybe i'm just not seeing as this is your model.would there be 'chains' of production or straight production. i.e. would an item be made by various properties working together, say mechanical parts would need say iron, carbon, technical prints and construction blocks. (forgive me it's been almost 2 years since i've played in the trade goods market). or would you simply own a factory that produces \"mechanical parts\".i know this could get incredibly complex quickly, but i believe if any game could sustain that it's eve. the other thing that i'd like to know, is how many 'properties' would be allowed on a planet as well as would the more properties drive down the production/quality of the items coming out of the property. we all know people would try to get to jita and buy properties there for ease of sale after all. yet someone who goes into a forgotten region like solitude might reap a massive production because no one wants to move goods that distance. the ebb and flow is interesting as well and i believe it would make people lose as well as make fortunes.the one thing i can't stress enough however, (if cpp reads this) do not let this idea become like moon mining concentrations i.e. if possible we should not have dyspo and prom planets where only the biggest factions snark them up and the entire market is buggered. i'm not 100% sure how to combat this problem without 'isk faucets' like omber zombie said. but hopefully it can be combated. one other thing that might want to be considered, will security status of a system effect if a planet is able to be interacted with much like moon mining and pos anchoring?the empires basically keep 0.8 to 1.0 systems 'for themselves' i believe they might do the same with this idea, however nations thrive and grow when more and more people can get into property ownership. as such maybe this would start out in any security and expand to even 0.0.i like the idea, and give it a good thumbs up. -kara"
"another thought that just occurred to take money 'out' of the system, the empires would charge a 5% to 2.5% (based upon a new trade skill) transfer tax when a property is sold between players. it's not huge, but it would be another sink. just a thought."
"to be honest, i think i'd waste a lot of time trying to explain some things here from economic theory.so i'll just leave it with this, rather then over simplify.why do people buy a home beyond just the need for shelter? why do people do home improvement? why are people so badly hurt financially by real estate value collapses? why are home starts and permits such an important economic indicator? why in the u.s are mortgage rates so closely tied to the ten year treasury note? what factors strongly tie the manufacturing, retailing, and real estate sectors together? if you are unclear on those relationships, i implore you to go out and take time to research them. don't just google a simple answer but actually read over a few wikki articles and government websites. i think once you do, you'll better understand exactly what i am asking to be introduced here.also to answer your question kara, i am not sure if it should be a circular supply chain. in that certain npc goods are needed to produce other npc goods. my gut instinct tells me yes. but free trade tends to promote peace and stability. something i am not entirely sure goes with ccps plans for eve given the tone of ea and factional warfare. as for amount of assets per planet, that is more tricky. i'd say the majority should be in low sec and 0.0 though. and that those planets be able to sustain far more assets. but as for quality of goods given a planets total volume of production, i'd be inclined to not have that. but to certainly think on it as a future factor to put in place if characters drive a planet to over production on a regular basis and keep crashing the market.brock, i know there are third party securities. and sadly, i wouldn't give them a single isk. this is a place where ccp shot themselves in the foot royally. you can't say you want players to develop markets, but then say you want players to be reluctant to trust others in investments as a core component of the game. anyone following the most basic risk management rules would never invest in eve given that situation. some regulation, and securities protection needs to be in place. in the real world, government over sight does that, here it is ccps job whether they like it or not. and until they decide to take that responsibility, securities markets in eve will not have volume or liquidity."
"well, you through alot of words at the subject, i can appreciate that. but on this one area i think you are daft out of your mind. i like having such a deceitful & paranoid environment. it allows an honest person like myself to thrive and excel on that honesty.if some sort of securities oversight were introduced good character, ethics, and integrity would be instantly devalued. i'd say the mistake that is common in people like yourself: you try to trap people into being good instead of letting people be whatever they are. call it laws, say it is for the common good, whatever you want to say, all i see is someone trying to place controls on my life."
"uiliam,i'm not totally understanding what you are proposing. it sounds like you are proposing a stock market or investment of planetary assets and production(completely made up) which means everyone's isk is completely at the benefit or harm of the gm working the associated system."
"it does lead to the interesting situation that npc goods can now be produced by players. and perhaps that production of these npc goods is capped.here's my take. before a player (or corporation) would be permitted to have such a franchise, they would need to have considerable standing with the faction and corp that controls the planet. that should raise the bar a bit. further, the player leases this franchise. perhaps an auction could occur near the end of the lease to determine who gets it next time.added: for my purposes, i propose that a planet with stations (maybe just stations in the system) can produce a list of goods. each good would have one or more as yet unspecified units of production and each unit of production would have a station associated with it. a player or corporation would purchase a lease on one or more units of production, paying a monthly rate for production. this is the \"franchise\" i mention above. once obtained, the leaser uses the proparty for the length of the lease, until it expires. rent for franchises would be just another payable expense. in addition, the leaser can use the property for the extent of the lease and make improvements to it."
"calling for simplified oversight on securities is trying to place controls on your life?so say i suggest if ccp institutes a stock exchange system, with a simple margin system. and that players have to deposit to an account, and maintain it in proportion to their current investments by some percentage or they get called. and the position is liquidated to make sure there is mutual party coverage, and that it remains a zero sum game.thats trying to tell everyone how to live?relying on a good ol boys system like you seem to be suggesting has never been good for anyone except the good ol boys in that club all ready. what i'd ask for opens up trading and hauling in eve, what your wanting keeps people out.so whom is trying to control others here really?"
"yup, you got me. i'm well known for my cartel like dreams and desires. i'll just leave you to your betterment for all though i'll reiterate, it's bs and will never happen even if it was not.when you go thinking up ideas, why not think of things that are possible? as a suggestion."
"the way it is now sucks. eve is an mmo, and you're only vulnerable to unrestricted wardecs if you leave the npc corp. people shouldn't be penalized for that...not to mention the fact that the current system strongly discourages smaller corps from forming.yes wars should still exist but not in the same form. change wardecs around and change the way npc corps work and problem solved."
"then i will basically need to create two more characters and constantly log in to micromanage their skillset. if i don't then i'm going to be at a huge disadvantage, because someone else is going to be able to do everything under the sun in eve and/or sell his characters off for extra isk.no. specialization is good."
"supported."
"i agree, honestly i think it's absurd that all 3 characters can't train at the same time. it makes the other two chars useless except for use as scouting alts. please make this idea a reality."
"i doubt it. you would have everyone a production and market alt most likely. you still have to pay for skills books. the guys who currently do production for making isk to support their pvp habits can close the other account.this really only works for things where you want both people at the same time. if you had a mining character and a separate pvp character you aren't hurt anymore than having to buy all the skills books for two accounts."
"this has been suggested numerous times in the past, and the answer from ccp has always been a very firm 'no!'.the reason is that this would hugely increase character farming, and make training much easier for isk farmers.if character trading was removed, i can see them reconsidering, but not otherwise.it would also further inflate the number of capital pilots, something i think most agree is not needed.so all in all, bad idea!"
"since ccp is hell bent on making multi accounting more expensive for us (upping the price on gtc's, removal of options of gtc's and killing off ghosttraining) i now see no other way but too fully support this topic. i would not have done so if the changes mentioned above had not taken place."
"many players are dissatisfied with how ccp has handled the ghost-skilling nerf, and of course with the nerf itself. dealing with this issue unequivocally comes under the csm remit to 'represent'.so, reps, please represent us. please press ccp to 1) unhide the complaints thread.2) stop locking discussion threads on the topic.3) respond to customers complaints.4) provide supporting detail for information to date that is perceived as disingenuous.4) reconsider the feature change in the light of customer desires and expectations.thank you.-vk"
"i've already put it on the csm agenda for tomorrow, don't worry, we read locked threads too."
"that was fast! thank you../impressed-vk"
"i cannot believe they locked a thread - way to go ccp or should i say cccpoh i forgot i support most of the points, i would prefer having a alternative suggestion than bring back ghost training, like a skill que or a 'cool down' feature where the training continues for a short while once a sub stops (like a week or 10 days or something)"
"i have already dispatched a mail to ccp saying that it's unacceptable. i hope it will be back open very very soon"
"not only does this topic deserves a thumbs up, but so do you guys"
"this is one of the most stupid things i have seen ccp do.i cancelled nine accounts. they will all come back eventually but i will make sure ccp suffers economically in my accounts from this stupid action and lying explanations."
"has my full support.also offer money back to anyone who signed up for the power of two promotion and who wish to cancel their accounts in light of the removal of ghost training. this will remove any perception that ccp obtained money through deception and may go some way towards mitigating their terrible customer relations on this issue."
"ad 1) achievedad 2) unable to judge, lets see what happens to this threadad 3-5) still missing ^^nice to see its on the csm agenda at least"
"all the posts about ghost training have been locked or \"misplaced\" how long is this going to be here."
"i knew i voted for you for a reason."
"although having accepted ccp's decision, i still think this was very wrong and shortsighted of them. they have clearly did not tell the truth about the reasons behind the removal of the feature, and attempted on many levels to simply suppress the outcry. if they have admitted that the decision was motivated by business sense, i bet we would still have *****ed, but at least accepted on some level, that it had to be done. lying to the community, repeatedly, and just blatantly pretending that we are all idiots is what most infuriating about the whole thing. so, if csm could make ccp issue a public apology for blatant lying, and to give us real reasons behind the cancelation other than \"data base issues\" and \"unfair advantage\" i would probably consider that a great success."
"fully supported, lying to the people is bad form, and leaves bad taste in one's mouth."

"op is on the right track."
"we all know well that capital ships are the most expensive, lucrative, and powerful of all ships in eve. they have a strong history of making low sec dwellers run in fear, or organize in an attempt to take on the challenge of putting it down.pilots whom face such massive ships and have no capital capabilities themselves all fear, yet respect these powerhorses. any sane man will think twice before attempting to attack a capital class ship on his own.we all know of the great battles in 0.0 and epic capital vs capital fights, we may hear about them by word of text, vent/ts, or even in caod...for those of you that recall that very first titan that was destroyed, you may know the pilot's name. but what of his ships name?i feel that capitals and super capitals arn't given nearly enough credit. people have proposed over time that we should have some kind of stat keepings of each ship. while i would give an arm and a leg (figuativly speaking) for this kind of \"spice\", i feel there is one first major step before adding any kind of ship statistics tied to every single ship.that step would be to make all capitals, or at the very least supercapitals have permanent names.this will in effect make owning a capital a much more rewarding feeling, knowing that you are about to take hellokitty, your hellokitty themed kestral into fierce combat, and you know she may never come back.and if you do lose that ship, you will think back to what all accomplishments you've done with it, and all the battles and kills it has soaked up.permanent names would give the ships more personality, help make eve more immersive and indepth, and make chosing a name a much more difficult task. hell, for me it would be almost as bad as naming my ferrets...(i finally settled on booger and goober) :p"
"this post gets tridik's seal of approval.even though its a dumb idea.i just like the op"
"meh, i'm in iraq and bored, what did you expect? :p you know i lub ya trid i saw what you guys did in fw...the united officialy won eve with that now to be on topic. yea....it's more of a rp thing i suppose."
"i proposed something similar half a year back.basically the idea was for all ships to be able to be named *once* per assembly, so that once you assemble it and rename it from it's stock name, you can't rename it again unless you disassemble and reassemble it.the whole point of the exercise was to have stat tracking for each ship, so that individual ships could have a record of how many fights they've been in, what ships they've killed, how much damage taken and output, etc. etc.the reason for doing all of this is to attach some meaning to seeing a ship's name on the overview. if some horrible pirate flies around in your area with an abaddon named 'dead puppies\" and you see it on scan, you know for *sure* that it's the same ship that ripped your buddies apart last week.yeah, it's an rp thing, and it's a lot of work probably, but it would be cool."

"titan graveyards plz."
"in reality what you are asking is simply to change some npc ship skin, as the ship statistics and even weapons sometime have nothing to do with the player piloted ships.thorax firing missiles (serpentis ships)? dominix not launching drones?amarr ships with weaknesses against em?and so on.the npc ships live in a different universe.on a \"bright\" note if you read the blog about the future optimizations it is cited in passing the \"beautiful\" idea of doubling npc damage and halving rate of fire. in theory it will keep npc dps at the same level, in practice i suspect we will see a increase in the number of ship lost to mission loading lag as the npc will have a large alpha. so npc apparently will change, how and how much is jet to be seen."
"situation: moon exploration and mining is both unrealistic and unlike asteroid mining in that, once discovered, a moon is productive of minerals forever.this makes each moon with valuable minerals something to be owned and operated in perpetuity by whichever corp can possess and defend it -- by force of arms, or negotiation, or whatever.by now, every experienced player in eve knows that every moon in every system has been probed and all minerals have been discovered. major deep space corps and alliances keep databases of the minerals on each moon and seek to expand their databases.by this means, the moons that are worth seizing are well known and the only issue is whose fleet will be largest.i suggest and propose that this entire situation be changed as follows:1. moon exploration be changed to a probability driven mechanism. each mineral might be assigned a partly random probability of being found (lower probabilities for rarer minerals), if any mineral is present on that moon at all. moon probes would draw a random number, partly driven by the owning character's skills and the probing equipment being used (can you see t2 probes? how about t2 launchers? or a bonus for using a specialized ship or having specialized (t2?) booster modules?), to determine if that probe finds that mineral. {comment: a moon is an unbelievably large volume of rock, ice, and dust, several orders of magnitude larger than the asteroids we mine -- expecting one probe to find all minerals no matter where they are hidden on the moon is just short of plain silly.)if the mineral is found, a certificate of location is generated. [see below]under this revised mechanism, a character would not be certain whether his probe found nothing because there is nothing to find, or because his searching wasn't lucky this time, which is much closer to real mineral exploration. i expect that players would tend to use multiple probes per moon, however, the \"optimum\" number isn't easily determined, nor is the \"optimum\" combination of skills and modules.multiple certificates of location would be possible for a particular mineral deposit on each moon. they might be held by different corps, or multiple copies by a single player. certificates could be sold or traded by players like any other object, but can not be copied.2. the certificate of location for the mineral found on a particular moon would then be required for moon mining to be effective. [works like a script -- load it into the moon miner.]certificates could be stolen or destroyed if the pos is defeated, based on the usual random chance mechanism.moon miners without a certificate would fail to operate [or might find only the most basic (worthless) of minerals].3. moon mineral deposits would have limited volumes and would, after that much has been mined, be gone. the deposit quantity might be generated by random means when the deposit is \"discovered\" for the first time.each time a moon mineral deposit is exhausted, the eve system [at next downtime] generates a replacement deposit of same type and not yet known size, somewhere in the accessible [to moon miners] eve universe.this would limit the overall value of a particular moon. it would also force the corps owning valuable moons to continue exploring for minerals since they would know that their present moons will, one day, be exhausted. [remaining size of the deposit might be reported in the moon miner's screen.]and it would offer an incentive to every player and corp to keep looking -- that elusive technetium moon might be the next one you probe.***improvements requested.thank you for your time reading my thoughts today.{i've been ingame since beta and have operated moon mining, reacting, and material sales since shortly after they entered the game.}"
"i like this, could use a few kinks ironed out but supported by me."
"supported"
"your proposal would only lead to chaos.unreliable provision of moon minerals will lead to unreliable provision of t2 components and hence market instability on that front.also, it's already a nightmare enough to manage poses, having to change what moon mineral is mined after each downtime is not an option.your proposal also fails to take into account that not all moon miners are part of the large alliances, individual corps and small alliances also partake in that activity and your proposal would render their investment void.if your objective is ultimately to lower the barrier of entry to production of items requiring rare moon minerals, there are better ways to go at it.here's a suggestion that does not disrupt the current investments and achieves that goal:assign a \"presence\" factor to moon minerals in a given moon on a scale of 1 to 100.set all existing moon minerals presence in a moon to 100.randomly assign new minerals at moons on a 1-99 scale.the amount of mineral mined on each moon per hour is equal to that moon mineral \"presence\" factor.this proposal is of course not without its drawbacks, oversupply of minerals leads to a price decrease, especially for rare minerals (the ones worth mining at less than 100 \"presence\", thereby making the investments of r64 moon owners moot. valuable systems suddenly become less valuable too. the investments people have made in probing moons over the years also lose all their value.ultimately, increasing the supply of r64 minerals decreases their value to the point where all minerals end up being worth the same (ie, the pos fuel it takes to mine them), t2 items become cheaper, thereby decreasing the value of industrialists' investments.while the current situation where a limited few have a monopoly on supply is not necessarily desirable, the alternative is probably worse."

"currently hulk invention takes 8 mechanical engineering datacores and 8 gallente starship ones.i think it would be fairer for it to take 8 mechanical engineering datacores and: 2 amarr, 2 caldari, 2 gallente and 2 minmatar starship engineering datacores.the reasoning behind this is that hulk invention drives up gallente datacore prices so all other t2 gallente ships become more expensive. doing this would lower gallente datacore prices and increase the other datacore prices and force people to trade for all the cores they need and reinvigorate the datacore market. i guess you could also make it so you can use any ship data interface to invent if that's possible in the coding, if not i don't particularly mind if its just kept so you have to use the esoteric one."
"TRUE"
"mining barges and exhumers are based on gallente technology. so it makes perfect sense the way it is."
"eeehh im gonna wait a bit first before i respond.: o /"
"i don't dispute that, it makes sense for them to be based on gallete technology but the result of that is a massive distortion in the datacore market which results in an inherent unfairness to those who wish to fly t2 gallente. keeping the esoteric ship data interface for invention allows it to stick to its gallente roots whilst splitting the datacore cost between the races evens things out."
"unless you make them using different decryptors the difference is moot. 8 datacores are nothing special, but the difference in price to the gallente decryptors imposed by the hulks invention was staggering and is still high."
"isn't this one of the reason why gallente ship data interface is pretty ship compared to others?"
"it would be great to see local only show you if you speak.all for changing it."
"if i may speak from a none pvp'er point of view here.the only people that this would benefit are those that are actively seeking combat and wish to hide their numbers and general presence from other people in the system.i dont think that would be very fair to the poeple that just want to go about their business without being ganked all the time by people that are actively looking to do such.i know that happens anyway, but with instant local at least people have a chance to get away or whatever they want to do. calling for a nerf to catch cloaking isk farmers is really just cloaking the reason behind the thread"

"no actually, it is not, even though i do not like goons in general, i find myself agreeing with many of them quite often. well, we can leave the \"herd behaviour\" out of it for a moment. i do think it is a crime to pretend not to have an opinion! which what you seem to have shown in your last couple of posts. just posting a quip and glib remark does not cut it. i personally want to hear what you think - rather than a quote of something relatively amusing. and you know why i want to know what you think? even though you are a complete stranger to me? because i think that for the most part part last csm was not very effective, because i think this is last time i will give csm idea benefit of the doubt, and i want to see how they do on the second session, and because i think it really affects everyone in game, including you.... so do not pretend to be an idiot, and actually give your opinion out."

"i have a few questions for the goons.... 1) wtf is the deal with the musical instruments? why did you waste csm and ccp time with that, when so many more issues, as apparent from your post, exist in game at this point? 2) what about general statement by goons on number of occasions, especially during \"threadnought\" surrounding the \"shrakbait incident,\" that they are aiming to destroy eve and ccp, and if they can, the will do so from the inside? do you think that you are pretty much working toward that purpose, to make a \"joke\" out of csm, ccp, eve, and generally will try to muddle things as much as possible? 3) please tell us what you have done while on csm? what vital issues for eve have you supported? do not forget the musical instruments now.... 4) how would you rebuff the accusation that as a leader of goons, and a member of the goonswarm, you are actually not trying to damage eve, and through it the ccp? (frankly, i think ccp needs a kick in the balls, allot of kicks, but damage to the game outweighs my personal issues of how ccp handles their customers)."
"hey guys and girls.i'm running for another term on the csm. the first csm was a bit of a rollercoaster, but i'm here looking forward to hopefully making the next csm work much better.anyways. whom am i?i'm charlie eriksen from sunny(hah!) denmark. i have been playing eve since late 2005.my main profession is piracy. however, i'm most well known for my heavy carebear interest, where i have been doing my own investment schemes, all which has been paid back to the investors. i then helped building up ebank, which is now worth over 1 trillion isk. i have enjoyed talking to a lot of different people, and i have always accepted a convo if people wants to talk to me about csm matters. i hope to continue to communicate as much as possible. i will be posting more thoughts and things like that over the coming weeks!i hope to see you all at fanfest!i will be posting tips of the day on a regular basis. here's a list of all of them thus far:#1 - how i would like to see csm improve#2 - my first campaign thread and my writings about the econonmy of eve#3 - in the media#4 - behind the scenes: computer science is fun!#5 - yarrtastic!#6 - live debate on eve radio this saturday#7 - going out with a boom!best regardscharlie \"lavista\" eriksen"
"most people would agree that lavista is one of the best of the current csm. he really does care about issues effecting the community and try's very hard to represent and raise our issues with the devs. the way he represents us is an example of why the csm was founded and should be an example to all future csm members of how to carry out the role.definitely worthy of a second term. thanks lavista, keep up the good work and good luck on re-election 8)"
"i would also agree, that despite his age the boy has done well on csm, and one of the rare few who took the time to come out to the forum and keep the community informed as to the progress on number of issues. this does not mean that i would not hound him, or that he could not have done more. lavista vista could have done more, as most of the other csm members, to oppose the idiocy of \"musical instruments\" for eve. also, there was a number of issue that csm simply said: \"yes masa\" to ccp - you guys on csm have to bear pressure on ccp, that is why you exist, to soft-handed approach, not being aggressive enough with your time spent with ccp, allows them to push csm over to the kerb. lavista vista needs to do better than he did before, not be a push over to ccp, but he still gets my vote, since i did not see many others do squat.remember that at the end of the day you work - even if \"arranged by\" ccp - for the players of eve, and not for ccp. i honestly feel that csm was more of a shield for ccp's recent actions in game, and csm did not do enough to protect player interests, as opposed to being ccp's mouthpiece 99% of the time. answer me this though:oh, and lavista, what would you change about yourself, and would you be a different csm member than you were in the past. because, after recently viewing your response in the \"dead horse\" issue thread, it would appear you actually regret communicating with us? the players? some of us maybe pushy... but that is how people get results, not by being meek. so, elaborate, go read my response to you, and then elaborate with your answer."
"i would probably like to try and represent and communicate more with a broader aspect of gameplay styles. i think my background is pretty well balanced, but by no means perfect. i have as a result of csm tried more gameplay styles, in order to represent more people. for instance, i was never a fan of pve. however, when the issue of exploration ships were brought up, i started doing exploration in low-sec and now i'm trying in 0.0, to see what it's like. i would also love to have more actual productive discussions on the forum. however, it's not something i can change alone.and i would like to respond less to trolls. but hey more perspective is never bad. however, nobody is ever going to be perfect. but that's not an excuse not to try make no mistake. however, i did release information about the specific issue because you were being pushy about it. not that it's a negative thing. however, it might have been wrong of me to post as detailed an update as i did, because none of the other issues had anything like that.however, i must admit i wasn't very pleased about the general attitude i was met with, hence why i wasn't proud of what i had actually written. while i stand by what i did write, i could probably have communicated in a better way in order to have prevented it. so don't get me wrong. if i could, i would have communicated with the players about the response we got right away. but i got squized between the fact that i have an nda and i can't really talk about things before the minutes are out, and the fact i don't want the community to feel ignored.it's a hard balance. but i understand that the current pos system is awful and that the dead horse idea looks awesome. but there's not much more to say about that."
"much love for this guy.  voted once and will vote again."
"quoted for truth, just not the love part"
"there, i will just paste it in:"
"ok, omber, other than the fact i tried to pay to have you delivered to my hangar... (/me hangs his head in shame)... tell me:1) i feel csm has been very soft with ccp, in other words they appeared in most cases, to just buckle under ccp pressure, and not investigating more when ccp refused to give answers, or was evasive. what are you going to do about it? 2) whom do you work for? ccp or players of eve, and what happens when ccp tells you to bugger off? do you say: \"thank you sir, may i have some more,\" or do you fight them and demand more answers, and clarification? i think recent csm has walked away too many times when they could have stayed and fought the ccp. if it is an issue that you feel ccp is trying to just not deal with, what do you do?3) what about other player communication? i think last csm failed miserably at being open to the player community. 4) and, finally, how do you feel about musical instruments in eve? and, do you think that we should trust a member/group of players who have vowed in the past to do their utmost to destroy eve?"
"should have paid me a decent amount and i would have delivered myself i agree to an extent with that sentiment. you have to realise though that some answers as presented to the eve public are heavily sanitised due to nda requirements. some issues fell into exploit areas (which can't be discussed) others fell into areas that were already addressed and were waiting on being announced by ccp. basically, a lot of the issues which got a simple public response were for those type of reasons. as for haranguing ccp into giving more complete answers - imho it's a major part of the job for the csm, and when the log for the last meeting makes it's way to the forums you'll see pretty much everyone in the meeting badgering the devs about things at different points in the meeting. if you need an example, both lavista and i instantly asked questions about why the qen hadn't been published when eyejog logged in, and hey presto, 3 days later we have a published qen.i guess it's all about getting an answer for the public that covers enough detail to satisfy the request, as well as allowing ccp to have some 'wow' factor when they announce things.i work for both. i'm there to relay and argue issues from the players to ccp and to pass the information from ccp to the players. as i said in the above 'wall of text' - sometimes the answers you get aren't able to published, so what may look like the csm walking away isn't always the case. i'm all for arguing with the devs tho if the response they give is unsatisfactory. completely agree but with the caveat that it wasn't entirely the csm's fault. i think it's a joint failure on behalf of the csm and ccp (next meeting should be fun after they read this ) on the ccp side: until recently the csm hasn't had a ccp secured forum to discuss topics (which as an alt i still don't have access to), the internal communications have all been hosted by serenity (cheers mate), the minutes section of the eve website hasn't been updated, and the assembly hall voting system is shockingly bad (no negative votes is a major oversight). from the csm side: i think a there has been a real lack of explaining the csm decisions - yes minutes of meetings were posted, but none of the csm members have cared to clarify their positions on the issues they voted on (some of which were highly contentious), and other than for pet projects, none seem to want to go out and see what the average player thinks about what is and isn't being raised and voted on. granted, that is what the assembly hall was supposed to be, but there are plenty of other forums on this site let alone outside of here (scrapheap comes to mind, i probably should register an account there).tl;dr - more communication is definitely needed, and i think pretty much everyone involved with csm agrees."
"damn character limiti think i actually voted yes to that one. not because it's something that is absolutely necessary to eve, but i am eagerly awaiting 'walking in stations' and think it would be a nice addition considering i run a live music venue in rl. one of the things i continually point to when people ask me why i play eve and not wow or some other mmo is that the community here is highly creative and any way for people to express that creativity as part of this game is a good thing.as for who raised it - yes, the goons have said they want to destroy eve in the past. so what - they failed, eve beat them (sorry goons). they came to this game attempting to break it, in the end eve was such a great game that imho it has effected them more than they have effected it.should you trust them? up to you i guess. i personally look at the issues rather than who is bringing them up - if i think it benefits the people that play the game, i'm for it, if i think it's harmful, i'm not.i hope that answers your questions, if not, please feel free to ask more"
"so far, you have oz, although, i think i might have to attribute your vote for musical instruments to some really strong aussie cannabis, at least for my own self delusion.... (sorry no \"shakes head\" emote on forums). anyway, you should make a platform, and post it, as i am sure others will do as well. i am sure it will get hairy on these forums pretty soon."
"elaborate, and in detail, otherwise this is just allot of bull-**** talk. no hot air, specific examples as to what you are referring to, or what you consider to b the \"entrenched interests.\" i am wealthy in game, and i have allot of \"assets\", and i am also \"highly skilled\" player - so what exactly do you propose to do when you take all the veterans - \"down a peg\"furthermore: eve is hyper-capitalist game. and fundamentally, any capitalist system is unfair. as such, eve is fundamentally an \"unfair\" game, where someone will always have an advantage, or will be \"entrenched\" to the point where there is nothing anyone can do about. think about it this way, in rl we have banks, and rich people have their money there, so we can not go and just take it. what do you propose, we try and \"rob the bank\" in eve? i think, also, what you call \"hegemony\" is actually a fully egalitarian system ,very much opposite of what you think it is, where you have to work for what you got. so, you would think that it should be ok for someone to surpass me in my skill points through what means? how do you propose to cut my isk? by hacking my wallet?how do you propose to curb my purchasing power? or my ability to make more isk with the isk i got through the market, and thus always staying ahead of the guys with less isk? do you wan to make eve into what exactly?"
"before i start out, i would like to say that i am definitely and old player, i have 33m skillpoints and am near full specialization in the area that i enjoy. when i play, i play with an organization that is able to give me pretty much any ship that i need to do a job with any reasonable fit for free. i am one of the players whose advantage has become too great over newer players. edit: i was typing as you edited, writing another post for you.the issue is one primarily of player retention. eve is a game which gains a lot of efficiency boosts as player density increases. but currently the game is set up in a manner that discourages players to continue to play past their initial play time. if we do not address this, eventually we will get a system where new players do not want to join the game.the crux of the issue is that the difference between old players and new players is too large and ever increasing as ccp adds new vertical advancement opportunities. one of the founding concepts of eve is that additional play time would not increase specialization significantly, that there was a realistic limit to how well you can specialize and that after that, in order to gain significantly you would have to branch out into other areas. this meant that the prime difference between a relatively new player and old player was only a few percentage points in their specialized field with the old player being able to specialize in more areas.eve has moved away from this setup, and it means that there is a gulf between the haves and have nots. while these gulfs are important to foster combat and strife, key features of eve, if they are too big and of the wrong type, then the \"have\" side never lets up ground to the \"have not\" side and the game becomes stagnant.what does this mean specifically?it means that we need to reduce the item requirement grind. achieving tech 2 qualification is a big thing for players. but is also means that the gulf between a player has a \"plateau\". before where the differences are huge, and after which they are small. a good example of this is tech 2 guns. the difference between tech 2 and tech 1 guns is not only the initial advantage in skill[~7%+any extra specialization] but also 50-80% range, and/or an extra 15% damage[and more depending on item availability due to the fact that named items are not as abundant as tech 2]. now we have, on top of that, thermo dynamics, for another 15% damage, 50% speed, 10% resistances in some instances, 15% repair rate etc etc. i don't think that plateau should exist, the item grind should be less dealing with primary statistics and more with secondary. money, experience, and skill are plenty enough advantages for old players to exploit, especially how they work together to make an advantage even larger. in short, it needs to be easier for people of all strata to knock the king off his throne. when the king is knocked off his throne, fighting occurs and that is what we play this game for. knocking down entrenched interests doesn't mean changing the way the game is played for them, but changing the rate at which players achieve the level that they can be a challenge.there are pretty much three areas that this exists. production, sovereignty, and individual skill. i have already discussed the problems with individual skills. there are some interesting ways to foster competition in production here. and sovereignty is a whole other bag that needs to be addressed, mostly dealing with the power of capitals and super-capitals, the proliferation of pos, the difficulty in removing them, and the lack of realistic secondary objectives. talking about that is a whole 'nother post, but i would be happy to do so if you wish. parts of that issue can be seen discussed here, with nande yanendid i fully answer your question?"
"you have to understand that eve is, fundamentally, a game. and because of it there are a number of fundamental differences between it and the real world, as well as a number of fundamental similarities.one of the fundamental differences is that in the real world, there is no over-arching entity that can make changes. another is that, in the real world, the \"goal\" of any individual cooperative actor[i.e. nations], is to gain the greatest benefit for its citizens usually described in wealth. in eve, the \"goals\" of individual cooperative actors are to have the greatest benefit for its citizens, but in eve, its described in fun.this means, that talking about eve in terms of \"how the world is\" doesn't make much sense. in eve, if someone were to rob eve bank, no one could do anything about it but try and shoot that person. in eve, we don't have a fractional reserve banking system with the full power of the state to enforce loans[p.s. real collateral backed loans would be awesome]this also means that at the end of the day, in order for everyone to have fun, you need players. hegemony is a state where one side dominates. this is bad, because that is when the game ends, someone has won. people go home and leave the game. people having fun in eve is more a less, a function of the number of people playing. you can produce more, there is more competition for goods and services, you have more targets, etc. fostering this is good, because, in the end, everyone has more fun.now, i am going to talk a little bit about power. power can be, more or less, described as the ability to coerce, force, or induce action.power is a zero sum game. this means, if you gain power, someone else must lose power. if we assume that you have more power over your own actions than a newer player, then every time a new player joins the game, so long as all influence is even[which is a necessary assumption to make this example make sense], your power increases[if only very slightly]. as the newer players get better, they take back that power, and your power decreases. but, for the most part, they never catch up to you, your power is maintained at a higher level for each new player that joins.while this is not true in the specific case because of variables, it is true in the general sense, in that as new players enter the game, the power of the older is continually expanded, the ability of new players to have any power increase is entirely dependent on newer players joining the game. the goal is not to take anything away from old players, but to make new players capable of controlling more of the game. this contracts the above system and reduces the amount of power that older players have. the power of older players will always be higher than newer, but less so, and so variations due to player skill, organization, smarts, and gumption will make a larger impact on the end result of the system than they do now."

"remind me why i'd ever want to undock in my helios again?'fixing' one ship by obsoleting another is not a solution."
"things i really really like about your production plan are...quite a few. this is my \"creative\" posting time.i think an easier mechanic would be for having only bpc's for the high meta stuff. just say that all ships are manufactured nowadays with nanite production molds. nanites are molecularly programmed to guide the assembly of many components at the material level before final assembly in the factory. a new set of instructions, like ship dna so to speak, are required for every production run.thus we have only bpc's and all production degrades if new bpc's aren't produced. maybe they derive from t1 data blueprints (the only bpo's) and are produced themselves with nano-tooling, much like dies have to be manufactured with special equipment.back to actual game mechanic stuff....rolling production anti-creep and systems that require constant re-investment to stay competitive are good because they erode the top end and keep things churning regardless of player age/capital and research ahead-ness.something i was also thinking about was, instead of increasing the real uberness of high-end gear, increase the coolness. one implementation could be to have dummy items that reference an existing item in the database, but have a customized name i.e. \"goonswarm i core compensator\" etc. paint pallets for ships maybe. cross-faction hulls with nerfed stats down to t1 ship specs... just ways to soak up excess income into non-balance affecting value.the conclusion i had in my acdc thread-rant is that the only value in 0.0 that ccp can sell is fun, so if you add style at the top end, you can soak up excess wealth and increase fun, adding value without doing anything to upset power balances."
"bpc's doesn't work to have competition. invention isn't a mechanic that simulates making new items to out perform your competition, its simply another input to production. it is, economically the same as a tech 2 bpo, just with a different barrier to entry and different fixed costs for production.this is why you need to use bpo's, because otherwise you will not be creating competition you will just have another production tree to climb.the problem with that is that you have to have dynamic creation of items in the database. it could work if your dummy items didn't change stats at all, but then all you're doing is adding a name to an item. and it definitely would not be easy since you've got to vet and implement new art for all the paint pallets."
"money supply in eve is tightly controlled with price floors and ceilings as well as isk and item faucets, so worrying about that isn't something worth worrying about. there will be a general decrease in price levels so long as it doesn't hit the floor since you are adding another good and not adding more money[money becomes more valuable, prices fall(note, if prices rise its because of a quality increase, not inflation)]at the bottom end of the spectrum will still be tech 1 and now tech 2 production. tech 1 will be more ultra cheap corp specific stuff, except for ships. tech 2 bpos will eventually fill the market to the point where they can reasonably be sold on the open market. their price continually decreasing as people amass more and more. eventually you might need a mechanic to remove them from the game, but i'm not worried about it yet, and it should be pretty easy to set up npc buy orders if you want prices above a certain level."
"so, the basic feeling is that hegemony needs to be made more or less impossible. \"in the beginning\" it seems cap ships were designed as a sponge for wealth. the idea being that concentrating your power as a single pilot gains diminishing returns and is harder and harder to maintain. since dreads can't receive aid during siege, they could be zerged and life should have been good.however, a couple of things break that mechanic. carriers for one, via the mechanics of the capital circle-jerk, just will not die to zerg. the dimished returns for each pilot are wholly counteracted by the synergy of this action. arguably second relevant mechanic is blinged out nano's with snakes and billion isk mods. get on top, stay on top. an undeniable third mechanic is the titan, but i have a feeling that's headed for a nerf on account of its problems in many contexts. last, as you have addressed so well in your proposal for production, the tiny bonuses of high-end modules add up quickly, so they don't act very well as wealth sponges, and instead reinforce the uberness of full faction fits.these mechanics work to reinforce hegemony because, if it takes a lot of t2 ships and/or capitals to zerg a few other capitals, the victor scoops the loot and the attacker goes home with jack shyt. titans obviously make zerg a completely unworkable mechanic for large fights.for large sov fights, there are definitely advantages to going huge and expensive. if you wipe the opponent, you take few losses and get lots of loot. there is definitely a motive for those on top to go for the landslide victory.in the context of regression, that route has a further financial load. if you regress implants as well, you hit pretty much all routes to staying on top, and everything requires reinvestment. fix carriers and titans, and the zerg attacks will return to full effectiveness in stirring the game up.carriers are really simple. dreads don't get their industrial sized damage without going into siege, where they are vulnerable. carriers as well need to require triage for their industrial sized repairs. bump up the bonuses on triage modules and reduce repper effectiveness. yay for packs of t1 domis zapping carriers into hardener-less suicide capital purges."
"requiring a carrier to triage in order to rr would go a long way to breaking up \"capitals online\".titans should go to \"capital killers\" with a big couple million damage[or more] blast every hour or so. and even that would go a long way to killing the \"rr carrier circle jerk\"speed nerf is probably a little harsh, what needs to happen is a mechanic by which smaller ships can get under the weapons/launchers of a larger ship, but not so easily run away from the fight. not sure how the speed nerf is going to play out, it has a long way to go.hegemony of the rich and hegemony of the old yes. remember, there isn't anything you can do to stop hegemony of the many once you fix the problems of hegemony of the rich and old. hegemony of the many is the least likely, but if all of empire banded together and decided to wipe some 0.0 entity off the map, its not like we could stop it. and its not like we should be able to.edit:when taking systems the loot is more defined in 1. high end moons2. the stuff that the enemy doesn't have."
"at this point i feel it's time to show some support for space whales.but seriously, i'm starting to have hope for 0.0."
"speaking as a carebear who will try to get into piracy before january (ghost training fiasco), i completely disagree with your proposal. i've lost ships to my own stupidity and i've enjoyed it. many pre-existing mmorpgs have worked the model you've defined, and some have been ruined by making the introductions you've suggested.we already have a system for \"consensual\" pvp - highsec space and fast ships. ccp has already appeased large swathes of players by making concord a guarantee that you'll get out safely. i disagree with this idea."

"i will ask you what i asked the others: 1) what do you think were last csm shortcomings?2) what do you do when ccp says \"no,\" and there is \"nothing to discuss\"?3) what are your passions about the game? you must have something you \"specialize\" in - that will of course influence your leanings. 4) do you think eve is fair? do you think eve should be more fair? less fair? is it fair enough? elaborate."
"once ccp officially published candidates i will start my campaign, before that i will take your questions but will answer them once the official campain starts.a statement will be made by me once the official candidationlist has been published by ccp.i'm sure this will answer alot of questions beforehand.meanwhile please keep sending your questions, these are appreciated./extreme"
"in a word, no.but id say this is because the csm as it was envisioned by both ccp and the player base never actually came to fruition.the idea,a council of people, elected by all the players of eve would offer an unprecedented means through which ccp and eves player base could communicate. the most prevailing issues to the player base could be more effectively identified and addressed by ccp then. this would lead to a better player experience, and a more profitable eve for ccp.the reality,a popularity contest was held with nowhere near the population of eve voting, and some people got a free trip to iceland. then petty rivalry and power tripping between certain players has made it as efficient as a one legged sprinter. and when an issue is identified and put before ccp, it is usually given lip service treatment at best. mostly because the issue was not all that pressing, and in all honesty was usually just a petty gripe about eves design. at the end of the day, things are back to par for the course, as the only real winners are forum moderators whom get a new sense of job security as nothing has been fixed and more than ever people are posting about it.change out a few things above, and ccp has made a shockingly accurate re-invention of the united states house of representatives.this first round of the csm was not a waste of time. it was a learning experience for everyone, from ccp to the player base. we rolled the dice, and saw our system for working the craps table was just flat out wrong. and that is all right, we try again, and we perhaps get some better results next time. or we choose to ignore that it is not working, and learn its short falls even more which really would be a waste.so here are some of my suggestions to make it better the next time about.one, everyone stays home.yes a free trip to iceland sounds really awesome. but ask yourself, how serious of a person is it that can drop everything in their life to fly off to the top of the world to debate a video game? this requirement basically cuts out the type of person whom makes an ideal csm candidate, a responsible one. i want to vote for a person whom is highly intelligent, knows how to organize things, and can deal with obligations in a responsible manner. sadly such a person is not free to run for the csm because they have actual career responsibilities, family obligations, and ambitions in the real world outside the game. im sure if being elected to the csm meant only making the time to join a few online video conferences with ccp staff, and one another to carry out the responsibilities of their office that they would do it on a weekend. but expecting a person like this to maybe give up their one week of vacation a year to sit around with the ccp staff and work out the issues with eve wouldnt happen.now let us look at the alternative. do you really believe that someone, for a fictional world, that has the week to spare and zoom off to a foreign nation to basically talk about said fictional game could ever have your best interest in mind?finally for ccps consideration,several web cams, 30 usd each.several usb headsets, 20 usd each. several next day air delivery changes on shipping, 15 usd each.one game where the community is represented by better qualified people, pricelessplease save the money from air fare and everything else and put it back into developing eve."
"but what is a better qualified candidate? they are one which will ignore what the mob wants, and work toward what they need, even though the mob has no idea what that is. a qualified csm candidate should be able to filter through the assembly hall forums, and look at the issues that need attention. they shouldnt have to cow tail to peoples christmas wish list of complaints. but they should be able to come together and work out why is it an issue, what is the under lying cause and mechanic, what realistically can the csm suggest to ccp regarding it. the csm is an advisory board, not a complaint queue. so they should spend most of their time as a representative in learning to see the bigger picture of what is actually detracting from the eve player experience. not dealing with the flavor of the month being nerfed, or a policy change by ccp to eliminate ghost training. ccp is a game design company, and they seem to have had a little bit of success at it, im sure they didnt just decide to annoy the player base by changing this or that lightly. so it is pointless for the csm to go over these issues, the pros have made their choice, the arm chair quarter backs should accept it. anything else is a waste of all our time.in closing, the eve player base needs to lower their expectations of what the csm can do to fix their personal gripes with eves design by a factor of about 260,000. they should instead look to have more qualified people represent them, and then let them do just that, with the belief that the person they elected actually gives a damn about them, eve, and ccp, and wants to make it better for everyone with a reasonable donation to us all of their spare time."
"from our point of view, csm candidates should do a whole lot of work and data gathering/reformatting, to present to ccp. it's a perfectly reasonable demand, but why the heck would anyone volunteer for it? the pay is crap / nonexistent.from ccp's point of view, all suggestions / topics are useless unless they're triaged and formatted by someone with knowlegde of programming, and specifically of how eve is structured. and i think that ccp feels the average player cannot get that unless they sit down with a few devs and have things explained and see things for themselves. thus, perhaps what would be better for the csm is for ccp to get them to iceland as soon as they're elected, train them up / give them all the nda'd behind the scenes view, and then send them back home and let them do work and submit [issues] electronically.in any case, there's a lot of work that needs to be done that falls in the realm of telling the playerbase \"we can't do what you're suggesting in [issue x] because it's just not possible to code with the backbone we have.\"ccp just wants to hear ideas that are technologically compatible with the current code, and the playerbase wants feedback on every idea submitted. but nobody's doing the work of sorting out and answering the \"that's impossible\" cases."
"i think csm played \"nice doggie\" for ccp for the last six months, they were largely ineffectual, and rolled over for ccp pretty much every single time. which is exactly the opposite of what they should be doing! just because ccp paid for their trip to iceland, their obligation is to the players, and not to ccp, and i think some of them have forgotten that pretty quickly. i just hope next csm grows some balls, and gets some teeth, because sure as hell ccp needs to answer some questions."
"is your sole purpose in life to flame and attack the csm and ccp with every word you utter?do you have anything better to do then destroying the hard work these people do?people who make mistakes just like everyone else?i've not seen one post from you today that offered any solutions... only insults... attacks...and deconstructive/negatives.you must be a very very bitter man."
"it's the same problem like with any democracy. the ppl you would like to give your vote are not up for election. the best what you can get from such an institution whose members have no power whatsoever, don't really know what they are talking about and come with their own personal agenda is a nice show. and you can't even watch these!if a forum doesn't last out for a company to keep in touch with their player base, that company got a real problem. the need alone for the csm showes there is something wrong big time. maybe it would be best to switch the company. sadly nobody got the balls to be competitive when it comes to online games."
"actually, if you do little research, you will find that i am very much pro csm, and have been from the very beginning. i am, however, quite appalled at how ineffective they have been. so, if me stating that fact, and thus making sure that future csm members are more aggressive with ccp, then, mea culpa. do little research, ok? the new csm has to be much more forceful than they have been, that is what i am pushing at."
"you can't demand a change of companies.... you can't even stop a company from making decisions.the only thing you can do is either keep playing or just flat quit.the quit part means you dont flame or attack.. you just stop paying for your account and walk away.if enough people do that... then you'll get there attention.otherwise your just throwing mud and not doing anything productive."
"excuse me, what you suggesting makes no sense. ccp was never so onsided before, ccp has never been so harsh and inattentive before. and i believe that one has to fight for something that one cares about, whether is one's country, job, life, or in case of eve a hobby. you quit when there is no hope, you quit when there is no other way. if you think that calling previous csm \"ineffectual\", and calling ccp \"inattentive\" to their customers = mudslinging in your book, then i suggest you re-evaluate your personal dictionary. if enough people speak the hell up, it will get their attention as well.actually you are the one who appears completely dispassionate, and nonchalant about the csm, i read all your remarks, and you appear to be an alt. so if anything, i would be suspicious of you mate."
"thank you for proving my point.tootles."
"how about the game design or information&communication technology students running for csm? debating video games is what we do.i'm not the only one.school gives me study points for it (i already have 12 extra ects but whatever) and it gives me experience that works out for me post-graduation. this is my last year. if the csm business would have started a year later, i probably wouldn't have had the time, but until then, i'm all yours. you'll see when i reveal my secret graduation project at fanfest."
"fact is, csm is good for eve, they have done allot, but they could have done more, i bet you all of them would agree. there were too many times when csm were not able to get over themselves and get behind something and really push hard for it. at least that is the general impression i get. i understand squabbles, and i understand disagreements, but, i am worried that csm as a whole were generally awed by the ccp/csm dynamic to be really effective their first term and give all they got to the players. if anything, i would re-elect them all for a second term, now that they have gotten used to the whole thing and see if they would do a better job at it, and would cover lack of communication - or perceived lack of communication, the lack of ccp customer attunes to their players, and a slew of other issues that have been plaguing the ccp<->player base relationship. it is people who are passionate about things that usually shine. so, personally, for those who care, i would suggest to either vote for the existing csm who have done a good job, or for any alt csms who have been through a process and know what the deal is, even for darius, even though he is a goon and i do not trust him as far as i can throw him - but if you like what he did then keep him in. chances are, now that they have been around the park they will probably do a better job than before, and probably realize what the shortcomings in the process are."
"absolutely correct, it's entirely irresponsible of me to spend my free time doing something i enjoy sorry, what? define intelligent - is there a minimum standard? do i need an iq score of 100+? what organisational skills do you require csm's to have? should i have a mba? i assume dealing with obligations like taking 5 days holiday to fly to iceland is not what you are talking about when you mention 'can deal with obligations in a responsible manner'?i have a career, i'm pretty successful at it imho, my family can get by without me for 5 days, and i have my rl ambitions which include starting an all electric dixieland band that plays the music of britney spears.i obviously don't exist. i obviously don't want to join the csm.oh wait, i do.yes, but as we have established already, i don't count.anyway, thanks for your concern, i'll be sure to send you my iq test results, brain scans, professional resume, bank details, medical history, family tree, credit rating, and a live recording of me singing bon jovi's 'living on a prayer' at the local karaoke joint so that you can look me over and i can possibly meet your approval.*oz* i probably won't send you anything but the recording of me singing, but i'm not sure you really want to hear that and i don't want to waste your obviously valuable time."
"and lots more."
"look at how stupid the op is"
"that's nothing... its going to get much worse in the next few days.guaranteed."
"you guys in goonswarm should copyright that remark, i have never seen it bandied around to discredit bad, as well as good posts, until goons came to the game."
"how does it feel to be a cheerleader? at least op is talking, and raised some valid points. all i see from you are one-liners, like you are on stage performing a comedy act, or just bumping that certain aspect...."
"is it a crime to agree with a goon?oh wait... your typecasting and applying stereotypes... i'm sorry... i guess i assumed you had the intelligence and rationality to look beyond that.i'll have to watch what i say in the future then.epic fail"
"no actually, it is not, even though i do not like goons in general, i find myself agreeing with many of them quite often. well, we can leave the \"herd behaviour\" out of it for a moment. i do think it is a crime to pretend not to have an opinion! which what you seem to have shown in your last couple of posts. just posting a quip and glib remark does not cut it. i personally want to hear what you think - rather than a quote of something relatively amusing. and you know why i want to know what you think? even though you are a complete stranger to me? because i think that for the most part part last csm was not very effective, because i think this is last time i will give csm idea benefit of the doubt, and i want to see how they do on the second session, and because i think it really affects everyone in game, including you.... so do not pretend to be an idiot, and actually give your opinion out."
"for me to express my opinion in such terms you could understand... would be a waste of my time... not to mention everyone else.you already made your mind up... your beating your war drum.why bother?"
"i dont think that is correct.ad 3) afaik ganged storyline missions will only give a faction gain to the person that accepts/returns the mission. the others will just gain personal and corp standings.ad 2) this is not correct (verified with a friend ingame) as soon as you have -2 faction or corp or personal standing you wont be able to use any related agent no matter what your other standings are. eg -2 amarr standings / +5 kador family standings = no kador family agents available (or in general: unable to use any amarr empire agents, no matter what corp / personal standings you have)so basically empire factions work the same as pirate factions (i would have been very surprised if there would have a difference).as soon as you reach -2 faction standings the only chance (as it is now) is to get derived faction standings by running important missions for a faction that is liked by your 'screwed' factionassembly hall: [issue]stuck faction standingsold thread (locked): eliminate 'stuck' faction standings"
"afaik this isnt true. unless it changed fairly recently.how much is a set of full snakes/slaves/crystals?it's because doing missions is hard in low sec, 0.0... once you add in the fact that most people totally ruin their pirate faction standings... mine are all like -10. we cant do anything in 0.0 for missions. the even worse fact is that when u do missions for them... your standing with empires drop quick and often make it impossible to return to high sec. which is bad because most people who go out to 0.0 eventually make their way back to high sec for whatever reason."
"ccp are slow as hell, more news at 11."
"i agree!"
"add the skill queue cos logging in for 4 seconds does sod all for game play."
"having no skill queue is really silly. it always has been. for someone who works 13+ hour days, getting skills done when i want them to without a queue is a huge pain. i don't like having to babysit multiple accounts on my hours off just to keep skills training."

"they already are. they do not destroy wrecks.smartbomb damage/rof/cap is all fine.but capital and range are very bad ideas, with faction and officer weapons they are already very powerful. giving carriers a cheap faction/officer alternative and a range bonus on top of that is simply unacceptable.all you would be doing is changing the supply line. faction/deadspace/officer sb's are already \"capital class smartbombs\" the production method is simply not as player driven as the player buildable items.now, it is possible to create player buildable capital class items which have the proper cost as to be non-trivial when fitting carriers and be limited to capital class ships, but you would need either a monopoly type system or rolling monopoly type system in order to get that done."
"need overhaul"
"agree'd smarties need more skills :dabout capital smartbombs taking out citadel torps... what about giving the capital smartbombs a longer re-activation rate too have a few holes where you can squeeze in your missiles.maybe not much more \"dps\" then large smartbombs, but a lot higher \"burst/alpha\""
"like i said earlier.until the smartbomb is changed from emitting from the edge of the entire ship, to the center point... then i can support capital smartbombs. but as long as they are as current. a smartbomb on a capital, is already just that a capital smartbomb.now for accessory skills, yes i can agree there needs to be more of that:-increase damage -energy use reductionnot for rapid refire as smartbomb's current skill should stay as is... that of a refire durationand not for smartbomb range as was stated earlier.i dont want to get into giant overhaul buff/nerf/reworkings rather i would like to see just a small tweak.but you get my lil support thumb on this because thats what ccp will look at.maybe a variant of the current smartbombs.... longer range for smaller dmg?"
"i absolutly agree, they are in dire need for an overhaul."
"something needs to be done, giving bombs to stealth bombers just hasnt given them a role, as it stands atm."
"big yes please."
"nerdiest thing i watch. its awesome."
"full 200% support."
"omg yes 100%... gogogo, i want it asap plz"
"i want my eve tv!"
"sure, if they get new staff to host it."
"you fail gone the staff were great and funny bring evetv back!!!!"
"supported"
"i think you failed to see posts from me almost from page one there m8."
"originally by: evangaas i read this you dont know you can jump from out of high sec to low sec. ccp could build in a restriction of not being able to jump from high sec to high sec. my point is to be able to jump from low into high sec. nothing more. period.all that was asked for is the ability to jump from low to hi sec not hi sec to hi sec"
"curently ecm isnt stacking paneltized, so runining mulpiple ecm on 1 target gives great results. without stacking panelty targets even with 2 eccm are jammes 50% of time + relock time so bs will shoot like 1 time per minute. ecm should get stacking panelty."
"ecm is chance based and does not stack so it does not have a stacking penalty.if you activate your first ecm it does not reduce the resistance the target ship has to the second ecm you use if it fails."
"i should have been clearer on that sorry. what i meant was make the underlying model tuned to react to how players move the market. say they determine here is what supply, or demand for a product can be sustained by the npc corporations. if the human trading market violates that by some percentage, the npc corporations buying or selling of the commodity collapses.i would imagine it works out like this.wheat has a demand figure of 0.05, so for a rule the supply of wheat that the npc trade goods market could handle in a given day would might figured out like 0.5 x 15. and from there you say no more wheat could be supported by the market then yesterdays supportable amount +/- 7.5% so if the human market pushes wheat supply in the market above or below that, we get a bubble forming that may become a crash. what forms a boom would have to be looked into more carefully. another generic formula could be applied the same way for the figure of supportable price.so ccp would not have to constantly watch the market, as the model of the market has a boundry built into it. does that makes sense?"
"i simply threw back at you what you threw at me.i've helped developed real time charting applications of market prices. those are much more complicated then this, and you can get that with just a graphing api and javascript in a web browser. most of the things to do this from what i see are all ready in the eve system. (the market history, and charts, the market table.) all this really requires if it is kept simple is a new window in the game client like the markets so basically a browser view, a database on the server side, and the coding to allow the deduction and addition to characters accounts and items. all that is needed after that is to develop the application that manages this and updates the database based on the market."
"i think that leads back to what i see has a problem for the eve economy in how moon mining and research and production are done though. i can see the merits of it this way. but it takes away from the asset holding mechanic, and also does not allow a steady liquidity to build up with the market for assets."
"failed.how about posting something other than \"stupid!!!\" with your main?"
"planetary assets certainly sound interesting, i'd need to see the idea fleshed out much more to support it though.i'm 100% against ccp created stock markets, they should be player run. ccp is there to provide basic tools to allow players to create things not hold our hands in the scary universe."
"where is the risk?the asset can't be lost, taken, blown up and can be held by an alt that never leaves the station.if you really wanted to push this it needs risk, like a pos can be blown up, can the asset be taken by force? why not restrict the asset with corp faction standings?biggest problem i see is the asset with no risk of loss. its the same idea as why ccp doesn't have a in-game faction bond as any form of a guaranty could hurt economy."
"personally i think planet interaction should be done a little different. at the moment in highsec there are moons with poses all over them. i would propose that given the right standing and enough isk, you could move your pos to planets.lets say, you need an 8.0 with faction to \"buy land\"you also need an 8.0 with the corp that has a station around the planet.add a new station server - planet management.you need an office on the stationyou also need an office on the planetyou buy up pos mods like labs etc and install them on the planet.each mod raises the planet office rental up, so no one could just throw 50 labs down, but they could if they had the isk.use the stations interface to interface with the mods you have on the planet. planet mods like ammo, ships, components etc are done at a 95% material needs (to cheapen it a little over the pos) anything made on the planet is deposited into the corp hanger at the station.pirate/griefers will turn that down as the corporation's assets are non-attackable. so it's not the most perfect idea, but i tell you, give people an unlimited pos like this, the database will clean up real quick!however the only time highsec poses really fall under attack is if they are at war. war could be personal could be contracted, doesn't matter. the fact is not many poses in highsec get blown up just for fun, too expensive to attack, takes too long etc. so really i can't see any difference between a highsec pos and moving all the mods to a planet with an interface instead of a pos. helps ccp and the users who can afford it out more then anything else."
"i like the \"moving poses to planets\" approach presented by sencnes there.i'm also dreaming of an endgame element where people could buy really expensive planetary assets of the sort that couldn't really be used to make profit, but that would give all sorts of bragging rights and e-peen benefits that would attract people. mansions with cool graphics would be one obvious thing. and here's another idea, a bit more unusual:players could pay a large amount of isk to become a mayor of a large city, and they could invest additional isk to various projects that would make their citizens happy. various cool competitive scoreboards could be included, but the major e-peen element that would motivate players would be getting \"loyal npc followers\" -- these would be npc citizens that have become really impressed and admiring of the billionaire benefactor of their city, and could visually present themselves in space as small npc fleets cruising their home system, and in various ways \"flying the flag\" of their benefactor for all to see.who wouldn't pay tons to have a fleet of 10 npcs cruising jita in cool ships flying your colors for all to see?and competitive scoreboards of who has how many \"loyal npc followers\" on which planet and in which star system would be really cool. the few ones actually flying npc ships could be just a tip of the iceberg. another cool element would be the followers of various players competing as political parties on their planets.this system could be expanded in all sorts of cool ways, like people sabotaging each other's mayorships and so on (there could be an entire simcity subgame), but the major initial elements would be:1) getting a couple of cool npc ships cruising around their high-sec system, advertising the greatness of their generous benefactor/leader2) the mayorship system should be such that it couldn't be used to make isk. it would cost a lot, and people could perhaps liquidate their positions for 80% of original investment, or something like that, but in no event could they make large isk profits, even though they were paying a lot.(one expansion would be utilizing these npcs to run missions as your companions, but the isk costs should be very large compared to this benefit, so it would essentially be done only for the coolness of it.)"
"the risk is constant price exposure on the asset's commodity. if you spend a billion isk to develop an asset and are paying the taxes and upkeep based on that, but the market has a meltdown for the commodity it produces, that is very high risk. also if you cannot pay the upkeep, the asset loses value, cannot pay the taxes it is foreclosed. i all ready did suggest that the ability to buy an asset be tied with faction and corp standing. i don't think requiring an asset to be outright destroyable like a pos is needed or feasible as that would require ccp putting changes into eve for ship on planet activity."
"i'm always disappointed in skills that don't serve a purpose at all skill levels. jury rigging 5, battleship construction 1-3 and 5, etc. for battleship construction (and all other construction skills) i'd like to see a reduction in production time per level. 5% per level would be reasonable. so, i'd say:capital construction: 5% reduction in capital ship/module production time per level.battleship construction: 5% reduction in battleship production time per level.cruiser construction: 5% reduction in battle/cruiser production time per level.industrial construction: 5% reduction in industrial/transport production time per level.frigate construction: 5% reduction in frigate production time per level.outpost construction: 5% reduction in outpost platform production time per level.i really don't think that this would have a significant affect on the market, and would make sinking sp into these skills a little less annoying."
"well, 25% less time is 25% more production, so its probably quite a large increase in market saturation. however, i do think those skills ough tot have some use, its very poor design that they do nothing.perhaps a smaller bonus, eg. 2% per level?"
"agreed. no skill level should ever be useless. i'm not sure what effect they should have, though your proposal seems sensible, but they should have an effect."
"sure, i am voting yes, just to see this idea shut down and killed by ccp in about 15 seconds. don't get me wrong, i think it is sensible thing to ask, i am certain, however, that ccp will veto this w/o any discussion from csm. so, yes, just to see ccp exercises their veto power. and, unless they will pull the \"sorry it will disrupt our database\" shtick... he he he..."
"aye."
"vote"
"even if ccp gets a boost of income now, it will result in a loss of income in the long term. assuming each player has 3 accounts (made up #), after ccp gets their \"bonus\" they get 1/3 of their previous income."
"no.firstly, no other mmo does allow parallel training as you have suggested, you need to log off one character to log the other on and train, thus you can only train one character at once.....just like eve!it will also promote character farming, which i don't really agree with either"
"i dont support this as it will only crash the char market. let this one lie.... i understand the mob is out with torch and pitchforks from ghost training.... im with you on that problem. but the fact is 1 char 1 training time, infact i would like them to fix the ability to set a toon to train a long skill, transfer that char to another account and then let that char train simultanously as the other char that was training already on the account"
"i agree with this since the beginning of year ccp have made bad choices for the gamers getting rid of 90 day gtc and 30 day gtc wich majer increase in sales for 60 day gtc and the ghosting is a good idea but has its bad ideas and then nano nerf same again good and bad (which i dnt think is taking place) and other things that have stopped us from having fun and making us isk farme all the time this is needed for people to come back or stay in the game"
"this. everyone who is supporting this is obviously not engaging their brains."
"this is a terrible idea. and not only is it a terrible idea, but the rationale used to support it is terrible too - it would do the exact opposite of a), b) would seem to be exactly the sort of cash grab players owuld thoroughly despise, and i really couldn't care less about the type of envious whiners you're holding up in c). on the bright side, i can safely assume it'll never happen."
"bolded the reason why it's a ****ty idea. also, the cost of skillbooks for most things is trivial"
"sorry to say but this is a really bad ideain some mmo's this may work but not evewhats to stop me creating an industrial alt that can fly hulks jump freighters rorquals etc etcand all you gotta do once you've trained a character is transfer it to a new account and you've got a character that you basically haven't paid for i think ccp would sooner bring back ghosting tbhmaybe a split training (an equal % to each slot with a skill running) but not this not signed xailz"
"bad idea. they made it this way for a reason. it's not going to change."
"im not good at spelling but ill ty and do my best.so my account has been in active for 3-5 days now for the simple fact gtc's have leapt a high price and are still raising, if you looked a few weeks ago they were 400-500 mill now they have creept to 500-600 mill now the avergae smart gtc payer doesnt want to spend the isk on a gtc so people like me ask for one at a resonable price 450-500 mill but the sellers have got greedy and started selling them at 500+ and are sticking to that. i looked at the timecode bazzar other day and sore there are way more gtc wtb than there is wts and sellers carnt keep up when we had all the gtc's sellers had a more choice if they didnt have alot of cash they would buy a 30 and then a 60 if they had enough and so on, but now if the sellers havent the cash they carnt buy the 30 so they dont buy at all = less wts and more wtb wich is causing a problem as the fact that ghosting is going to be banned the time it takes to get a gtc will run into your account expired which leads to all stop on training wich will lead to the buyers thinking ahh what the hell i cba any more with this which is less sellers and buyers=less cash for greedy ccp (or marketing side)now i suggest ccp return to the marketing side of them and ask are you sure this was the right ideas im sure you are loosing more money than your making and the fact that they thought 60 day were the future to soon must have crippled the game a lot i suggest bringing the 30 and 90 day gtc back would be the best idea for ccp now to keep there players and keep getting money.i now this has been mentioned loads of times but i would suggest everyone post there thoughts maybe i am wrong if so tell me now plzo and i no people have been saying iski farmers are a biggest problem for ccp right now but are you sure that is a problem for ccp i mean think about it as long as they are still paying for the accounts and ccp are getting money from them why ban them its a exploit that ccp have found, they said they would take action all i have seen is buffing the isk farmer problem not nerfing it all they need to do is ban the odd one and say we are doing our best and they get away with easy cash and no problems"
"obviously if gtc sellers are selling at that price, people are buying them at that price. supply and demand my friend, and if you feel like its not worth 600mil to keep yourself in game for 2 months, then go spend real money."
"or quit and save me the hassle alltogether each way is good tbh ^^"
"if you're not willing to pay the cash, and you're not willing to pay the isk so that somebody else will pay the cash, then that'd probably be your best solution. ccp doesn't do this for free, nor should they."
"according to ctrl + f, there were a grand total of 3 periods in that entire walloftext. granted i can't be assed to try to decipher it, i'm just going to say the op needs to learn what supply and demand is, and needs to get a job."
"i support this initiative but i doubt it'll have any impact. just look at the 30+ 90 day gtc removal a while back; all we asked for was giving up the options even if we paid the new higher price and ccp still ignored it. if you manage to get them to change ghost training it'll renew my faith in the csm. you do a great job, don't get me wrong, but ccp doesn't seem to listen to the more sensitive issues."
"this. i have no expectation that they will reverse their decision, but it would be nice to get an apology for the way we were treated, and an assurance that the lesson has been learned and the error will not be repeated.ccp: it's your game, shape it how you want. but just don't bull**** us about it, ffs. the bald, unpleasant truth is a hundred times less provocative than a stupid, obvious lie."
"assuming we can't get it back, i'd like - \"sorry we lied to you.\" - \"we'll give you a couple of months notice if we ever do anything like this again.\" - \"we'll go and make you a skill training queue now.\" (for f**k's sake!)"
"the funny thing is that we can basically see how useful csm really is on this topic alone. ccp does what ccp wants and doesnt care what the csm does."
"well, i'd like to see a converter for minerals..i.t taking 2 tritanium and sort of bpc or device and cooking 1 pyerite,or taking 2048 tritanium and bpc and making 1 zydrine..this is due to some minerals could be missing. in certain locations, and converting them into each other will make prices more stable. the same true for moon minerals..and one more thing, if bpc is just a paper, why not to \"fax\" it to certain station? could npc corp offer a sort of fax/postal service?"
"your first idea would wreck every market in eve, and your second one would change a few things pretty dramatically - most notably, utilization of lowsec research stations, and logistics for 0.0 groups. also, it's a bit simplistic - \"blueprint\" can just as easily include scale models and prototypes, which can't be faxed."
"it wouldn't wreck markets, it would just provide new price ceilings and floors, as once a mineral became too expensive it would be converted into another.would do the same thing for moon minerals."
"true, \"wreck\" would be a short-term thing. it would drastically change them, however, and remove a large part of the complexity in the current markets, which i regard as a bad thing."
"vote"
"the proposed cure is worse than the disease."
"supported. ludicrous speed has got to go but the proposed changes are a complete disaster."
"would definitely like to see some actual thought put into the consequences of the current change, rather than just tihnking about the actual change itself. examples include blasters, autocannons, battleship mobility, interceptor survivability, hac usefulness compared to t1 bc, as well as missile, laser and drone balance.there's been almost no attempt to preserve balance of other parts of the game while balancing nano. no thought put in."
"support of the op. ludicrous speeds is whats need nerfing, not a complete gamechange to make the game static and guerrilla warfare a joke."
"i propose this because i am, in part, not convinced that stability of supply, and therefore price, is either realistic or desirable. the present system has limited supply ... as the real life situation with oil demonstrates, when demand begins to come very close to supply, the price will shoot up.as you'd expect, this will cause the needed reduction in demand -- as well as causing increases in the prices of all t2 components made with that mineral.by inventing a mechanism to add supply [when a moon is exhaused another is added], ccp could choose to increase supply by quietly increasing the number of new moons supplying technetium [or whatever] without telling anyone.**as for your small holders and alliances, all of them are at risk of being drafted into one side or the other of the major alliances' wars. the mechanism is simple -- join as our ally and supplier or be conquered.i think small holders would be better served if valuable moons were constantly being discovered -- this would reduce the value of the moon mineral databases the majors maintain.the probabilistic method of finding minerals would also mean that even if someone other than the moon's current tenant probed it, there is no assurance that what the current tenant is mining is what the character doing the probing has found. thus, uncertainty is increased and other corps have less reason to conquer that moon -- they don't know what they'd get and, without the right certificate, can't get it anyway.this would tend to protect the small holders and alliances from arbitrary exercise of power by the big boys."
"i like it"
"limited resources on moons means that mining pos no longer become a valuable target for operations. especially since you can't know how long you will be able to produce for.all you would end up doing is having everyone put pos on all moons after generating the certificate that they want.end effect:1. less conflict over moons2. more pos as moon mineral wealth is spread out.3. moon scanning becomes tedium as each scanner will be looking for 95% confidence in material composition4. increased logistics as pos have to be moved when resources dry up.that is 4 negative effects and no positive effects."
"this would be too much of an imbalance to the game. not supported, even though i would love to see it from a pew pew perspective."
"current state of affairs:often someone either randomly goes through systems scaning and opening plexes and never gets back to them for whatever reason (up to and including getting blown up before they enter the plex) or a group of defensive plexers will flip a system uncontested and one, two or more plexes remain open and visible on the overview.defenders get no points for closing a plex in an uncontested system and defensive plexing is bloody boring enough as it is. however leaving them open gives an advandage to the next would-be attacker that comes along.proposal:if a fw plex in an uncontested system is opened but no one starts the timer on it, the plex should disappear from the overview after a set amount of time.despawning the plex probably isn't necesicary, but the possability should probably be looked at by the design team and either considred or rejected depending on their evaluation."
"i've already put the spawning mechanics on the agenda and will add your specifics to my document."
"forums ****ed up on me today, didnt let me post to the thread i hoped for.please delete!"
"what have you accomplished as far as ingame changes, and are there any pending changes that you have brought forth yourself that you are able to speak about?"
"dear jinx, here come my answers: 1) csm being bunniesas i have been receiving most of the communications between ccp and csm, i can ensure you that the first csm was not as evasive as your impression based on the forum might show. unfortunately they were not allowed to disclose their complete communication with ccp (see eula), but i can ensure you, they squeezed a lot more proper answers out of ccp than what ccp originally answered. you also have to understand that csm's options are limited. csm in in no position to make ccp do anything, as csm cannot fire ccp, nor take their money. as for what i would be doing about it? continue the modest pressure csm has been putting on ccp (even that we did not communicate this very well) and hope that there will be a better turnup on the next election, as the csms power depends on community support, and community support can be best expressed with the participation on the elections. 2) duplicate of the first questionsee answer to first question. apart from that, i would be working for the community, and if ccp tried \"not to deal with it\", i would re-request an answer and ask for a better explanation. if ccp \"does not want to deal\" with a topic, they can veto it so it does not get on the agenda at all... so if they already agreed on an item to be open for discussion, i feel that it is completely okay to push them as long as they say something acceptable. definition of \"acceptable\" differs from person to person. as for me, i usually stop asking when i get the feeling that the peer is simply not able to provide a better answer in the time available for replying, but go back to the topic at a later time. 3) csm and player communicationi agree with you, communication between the playerbase and the csm could have been a lot better. if i get elected, i will try to improve it, as in the end, csm-playerbase communication is the reason why csms achievements is not perceived at all by most of the players, leading to questions like most of yours. 4) musical instruments and destroyers of evei personally like musical instruments. i think eve deserves more musical instruments. i had the chance to step into a place of a csm rep when the topic was on agenda, and i definitely supported it. as for the other part of the question, i trust individuals, not \"groups of players\". i do trust people by default, until they do something to lose my trust. 5) fairnessthere are nothing that's completely fair. eve isn't an exception, it's not fair either. i do value fairness however it is not something that can be descibed easily. if eve would strain for total fairness, then new players would have same chances as old players, and everyone was flying in the same ships, using the same modules, having the same skills, an there would be no thing like money and assets. well, i definitely do not want eve to become so fair. but i do think that players in similar situation, similar age, having invested similar amounts of time and money and effort into the game should have equal chances."
"hello,i am happy to announce my application to the csmif i am elected my focus would be the \"the little guy\". those folks that remain independent or part of small corporations. i have a definite industrial focus but see that there is also a lot to be said about the \"fighting\" side of eve. i had created a statement before some of the recent anouncement (medals and market inprovements for example) but have left my thoughts about them in my statement. you can look at that i had provided when i applied at:issler dainze csm statementi'll try and closely monitor this thread and respond to any comments or questions.thanks for taking the time to read this and hope i can interact with many of you in the days to come.issler dainzeceo tadakastu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord(note: i have not received a response to my application yet from ccp but i expect it is in order, does anyone know when they are going respond to the applications?)"
"i haven't received a reply either, so you're not alone. i imagine it will probably be sometime next week.also, i want to wish you luck! i read your statement and it seems quite interesting, i hope we have the chance to serve together!"
"why thank you garion! i look forward to some interesting discussions and i also wish you the best of luck!i see some candidates have choosen to reveal that they actively play that mmorpg game called \"rl\". i admit i have dabbled in that game and would be willing to describe the \"toon\" i made when i started playing. i find a lot of pilots i encounter in eve play \"rl\" regularly, some play too much for my tastes in fact. if it is important to enough people i will be glad to tell you more about \"michele\", my female tech worker toon that i play on the \"seattle\" server. maybe some of what i do when i play \"rl\" is relevant. if you think it is ask away and i'd be glad to tell you more.to be honest though, i find \"rl\" to have some serious design flaws. the leveling system is terrible and some aspects of the game mechanics leave a lot to be desired. it doesn't take long for me to be tired of the limiting enviroment (come on rl developers, shouldn't we have the \"flying cars\" and \"life on the moon\" expansions you have been promising for decades by now!). and man, talk about some sorry looking avatars! so anyways, i'll gladly answer any question you might have, even if it has to be about that dumb \"rl\" game some of us play. i hope, however that most of the conversations will be about the realities we face right here, in the eve universe. we face some big challenges and i hope i can find a way to help us all find our place in this great big 'verse.issler"
"\"industry, lowsec, and roleplay (oh my).\"ive been thinking, lately. thinking about what i think could be better about this game. i figured that now that we have this csm, maybe i should tell my ideas to them. and then i realized that the csm elections were coming soon. maybe i should not only present some ideas to the csm  maybe i should run for the csm. after all, we have two expansions coming that focus on things that i have ideas about  even if my ideas wouldnt make it into those expansions, its a good time to raise them, when topics of industry and roleplay are brought into the spotlight.so here i am, running for election.let me tell you a little bit about myself.in eve, my primary jobs are to be an industrialist, a diplomat, and an administrator  i run a corp, take part in alliance leadership, and administer a mutual nap treaty between several alliance and a number of corporations in several lowsec systems. my hobbies include mission running, racing, exploration, and pvp, and i also spend quite a bit of time roleplaying and immersing myself in the eve universe. my alt, thulla icin, is a member of eve university, a corporation that teaches newer players more about eve, and helps them find their feet in this game.in real life, i have served on the student senate in college, which i believe is an experience that will be of great value in preparing me to represent the players of this game to ccp. in the student senate i helped represent the concerns and issues of the student body to the college administration  now i shall help represent the concerns and issues of the players to ccp. and any of my fellow senators can tell you that i am an asset to any meeting!let me also say a little about my ideas.my slogan is industry, lowsec, and roleplay (oh my), which should give an indication of the kinds of things i intend to focus on  though i hardly intend to exclude other issues.in regards to industry, i feel that we must make sure that our attention to industry includes not only something for those who produce the goods, but those who use them  the combat players. changes to industry will affect them as well, and we should be sure we have input from the consumer  and new things for industrialists to make means new things for combat players to use and destroy.i also believe lowsec needs a boost. recently, we had an update, the empyrean age, which made lowsec a battleground for the forces of factional warfare. what we have not seen, however, is meaningful improvements to low security space that would give non-pvp oriented players more of a reason to spend time in lowsec. offering rich industrial oriented rewards in lowsec would be good both for those brave and cunning enough to exploit its riches  and for the pirates who prey upon the less cunning.finally, the coming of ambulation puts the immersion aspect of eve into the spotlight. while i understand that this is not important to everyone, it is very important to a number of players, and, i suspect that while it is not the most important aspect of the game for the majority of players, i think the majority would agree that it adds something to the game. i intend to be an advocate for this aspect of the game, while keeping efforts balanced with other aspects of game development, and ensuring, as always, that there is something for everyone to enjoy  more events, for example, that will lend a sense of immersion for those to whom it is important, but that might still offer some interesting combat  or interesting rewards  for those less interested in immersion.if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. i have a blog for the election that can be found here, please tell your friends, i hope that you will support me, but regardless of who you vote for, i encourage you to get involved, find out about the candidates, and vote.thank you."
"i think you can count on the festival for this one gvote garrion, vote for lowsec"

"i was thinking about what you said about gs zerging likewise in the event of a fast t1 or t1-esque production chain.while gs would benefit from this tactic (and obviously enjoy the hell out of it as would i) it's not hegemony of the rich or hegemony of the old that would be operating, but hegemony of the many, which we've already stated isn't something that can or should be removed.second of all, fast t1 production works to level the 0.0 war-fighting field. t1 ships are easier to fly at max or near max skills, so getting zerged back doesn't really advantage the old all that much. when it comes to capital ships and t2 ships, if the zergly production chain can't manufacture them, then that advantage is going to wear thin over the course of a war/battle as well.lastly, while the effects on an extended battle are rather obvious, we have to ask, is this not what we want? should pilots not fly ships time after time? though large battle may begin to resemble a giant rts game with some people flocking around in one constellation running a production system and another group trying to ninja the opponents local production operation, all while fighting a huge as battle or series of battles in nearby systems, how can this possibly be a bad thing?so, while the system will advantage the rich and old as much as it advantages the new, the fact that the rich and old have to take the same route to utilizing it (pretending to be poor and young) would in fact have a leveling effect across the galaxy.now for how to not affect the t1 system or at least keep from tearing massive holes in the economy..."
"the reason i was mentioning it as a possible problem were twofold.1. t1 production means cutting into t1 producers profits: this can be fixed2. zergy production chains benefit entities that are better able to protect them more. there is an efficiency advantage for space holders in this respect. not saying its a bad idea, but it is not one that necessarily will benefit the small guy."
"the way i'm looking at a potential solution is to make it the kind of thing that evaporates the first time someone shoots it and fails to be productive without pilots in the system. no stability and no passive value. from minerals to final products, no step can run for more than a few hours (minutes maybe even) without some input.shortening the time interval would create the pos effect similar to having to run all over the galaxy to deliver fuel, limiting the ability of one individual to run a gigantic system. however, while people are in system and micromanaging things, production is through the roof. small volume increments of high value stuff that fills up a very small silo or bay would be desirable i think.have a question about your last post. going to ask it in a very uneducated way on purpose:if a system requiring stability benefits alliances and a zergy system also benefits alliances, what doesn't tip things in favor of the old?i guess when we're talking about the hegemony of the old/established, it boils down to the things that allow a two-year old 0.0 alliance advantages over a similarly skilled and directed two-day old 0.0 alliance.to keep that level of the action stirred up, all that's probably necessary are paths for day one to get a solid enough footing to have offline presence and production going.in the event that sov goes to a planetary system, there will end up being more slots open or weakly defended/not cared about at moons for alliances to set up shop. if the pos is given some measure of offline presence, albeit non-permanent and vulnerable to getting steamrolled and bubbled into ashes, a fully fleshed out production system is all an aspiring alliance would need to make the move to 0.0 on any day of their choosing.in my current situation, those are the only two things i want for my corp. if we can produce ships and modules, have some other sources of income to get stocked up for war, and keep from getting scanned down and blown to hell, we're fine. we can find a system with the right location and political situation. we can beat enough people to win some breathing room. that's really all we need to get started in 0.0.everything after that would depend upon our ability to build successes into momentum and avoid costly engagements while trying to disrupt our target system holder's economic activity to get them weakened and overexposed. next comes system sov and maybe outposts etc etc."
"almost nothing: the issue here is a non-linear advantage given to larger alliances. now, i was not saying that the mechanic proposed would necessarily do that, just that its something you have to be careful of to understand what might or might not add to the power of current power blocks lets first start with corporations in the real world. when corporations become big, their influence in small areas of the economy dwindles[usually]. the answer is not because they are too unwieldy to partake in those endeavors, but because the amount of capital they have is enough that they would not be able to utilize all of it if they went in that direction. such, small corporations can spring up and pick up the slack.[oftentimes with the larger buying a portion of the smaller]. if the large corporation, in its own entity, were to go into the niche markets they would have to create an extra layer of bureaucracy to deal with coordinating.in eve, that extra level of bureaucracy is unnecessary. alliances are more likely to operate like oligopolies, where there is a loose association based on some common ground [geography in eve and production type in the real world]. this means they gain all the efficiency bonuses of non-competition and none of the downsides of increased overhead to deal with coordinating everything.gs works this way, we have ops and generalized \"directives\" and subsidies, but for the most part, you don't have to go on any ops and the subsidies and directives only serve to inform those who aren't where the best profit opportunities are. then we all benefit from the lack of violent competition between us and go have fun.because of this, the advantages that you can glean for most cooperative actions, rather than increasing linearly, increase exponentially[where n >1] and because of this, power is pushed more towards those who already own the space and have already gotten the non-competition agreements in place.mechanics that buck this are mechanics that increase linearly in power, which, can pretty much only be personal[not exclusively, but close].a system by which people can produce close to the front might be better for the little guy[more likely for the aggressor] since they allow an attacker to reduce his logistics chain[which is especially important for someone who doesn't have a logistics chain, more likely for a small guy than a bug guy], but its still something that has to be looked at carefully.i think it would be better to limit the number you could use per system, make their production require no logistics, but have the resources produced fill up a small bay and stop when the bay was filled, so there was a rate at which you could produce but a max amount that could be in reserve at any one time.are there really enough people wanting to get into 0.0 that can't or is your corp one of the few? to really make a dent, i think you need to have make individual production much higher[and dense], as to lure more people into the space."
"lol. well...being that i enjoyed clones without having standings, ratting up a few hundred mil on a moments notice, dodging gate camps, the increased market opportunity (for a trader), having stations, yes, i'm more than ready to get back to 0.0.i've basically only lived in 0.0 and still haven't adapted to empire life. i'm a mission noob and feel like rambo getting paid to work a carnival shoot-the-clown-with-a-water-pistol game. yeah, i can still make money trading and pretty much everything in front of me melts in missions, but it's boring. it's dreadfully boring. it feels like every other god-awful mmo and i can't understand why there isn't an exodus happening in five minutes with twenty thousand pilots carving up a huge free trade zone.in fact, i don't actually have a clone in empire right now. i'm like a homeless wanderer in 0.0 with skills and cash learning to solo regional economies because i'm not civilized enough to fit into empire life.i go around in empire and i'm like a sheep in a grass-munching frenzy. sheep and wool flying everywhere and everyone trying to shear as much off their own backs as possible. entire pastures turned to dust and still there they are scraping around for roots. thousands of sheep sitting in the homeless line at the mission runners desk for a free meal because there's nothing to be had in empire.this is purely my own selfish view, but could we please turn empire off? it's a disaster. a f*!&ing disaster and i'm glad i came to empire because it's been an eye-opening experience. this is what people have been doing since i left after a month of off and on missioning in a catalyst and getting blown up in thoraxes by any random lachesis? i thought...i thought that people would move oni'm in a position now to lead a tiny band of fresh blood out of this disaster with skills in hand to turn them all into expert nomads and zerglings in no time and save them from this disaster. by and by, i have come to understand why people think eve is such a dark game and also why i'm thinking of myself almost as a humanitarian to do something about it."
"assuming nandeyanen is nande yanen, i was asking whether or not many people were wanting to get into 0.0, rather than just a few."
"yeah, that's my \"go help noobs in npc corp\" alt.i don't know what the proportion is. no idea really. i don't understand how it could possibly be too low. i think a lot of people lack the experience needed to know just how sh*!&y empire life is. that and the clear direction. you see yourself in a tiny corp or a tiny alliance and aren't sure and have a few bad tastes from the experience of getting pawned at the hands of a megathron rr gang with barely 850k sp.what is probably in far shorter supply than workable mechanics are simply good leaders and recruiters who can put together a smoothly running corp and find it a good alliance for a home.whatever barriers to finding the drive to move to 0.0 exist are probably more mythical in nature than not. i'll find out soon."
"i think it has a lot to do with the fact that individuals can make as much money in empire after grinding up standings as they can in 0.0.[pretty much, after the risk]."
"true that. i have no great standings and desire no further standings. still, is the game about achieving a huge level of bling or having fun? that's something i can't understand at all.how do all these empire ppl get rid of their isk? give it to the pirates and nano-gangs? i don't understand that at all. there is no level 70. stop grindinganyway...for sprucing up 0.0, we need more income and space-bling. back to the whole idea of putting stuff at the top and at the end of the rainbow... darius was pretty dead on when he said there's really not much to go for in 0.0 once you've blown up and put down enough space sticks. you get a flag. you're done. sure you're rich. you have outposts that look like every other outpost, but then what?check this idea out:say that these new space-rock (planet) eaters or whatever produce two kinds of goods. the first is useful for the production of all sorts of zerg friendly goods that are needed to support an up-and-coming war effort and quickly bounce back when the fire blows over. the second is used for the following:alliance named goods. yes. dear e-p33n. they go from meta to faction and require the alliance ticker in order to fit it. an additional fitting stat that just checks if you're in alliance. have to melt it down or sell it back when looted. using dummy database entries as i was going for earlier.faction, cross-faction, and pirate ships. several flavors available and built in with the regression system. mk i-v. mk i is a low-stat version that's probably closer to a tier i ship and has fewer slots, but hey, it's really cool looking and probably has neat bonuses. mk v is the uber expensive faction ship that soaks up wealth and removes it by getting zerged, but we're all rich, so people will build them.implants of all kinds. also built into the regression system and requireing some kind of cool invention system. archeology etc can be used to pick up technology from all these cool pirate factions and leftover jovian crap.new alliance structures that are neat. landmarks, cooler stations, capital structures, etc etc. exclusive access and having their own environments once we get to the whole ambulation thing.modular (finite and non-linear database entries) and customizable (new artwork with support for pallets) structures for everything from towers to stargates. maybe not the little stuff, but definitely the big eye-candy parts.monumental structures that can be anchored at unused gravity wells. limited purpose, but what the hell, it's cool eh? coolness has value. construct a monument to a special occasion.methods for defacement and destruction that require appropriate levels of pvp pwnage accomplishment.a neat side effect is that if you can't process the stuff, you sell it and get isk that you need to get more capitalized. whenever a large battle is lost that had a lot of zerg production involved, there's probably a stack of the high-end assets in store somewhere that you might be able to capture and convert into space-bling to commemorate the win. yes, smart players will dump it out into space and let it pop or ferry it home when things go bad, but occasionally this loot pile will get captured and there will be much rejoicing."
"two things:1. a lot of the people producing in empire play in low-sec and 0.0. people who make enough money to pvp off of are rare. its impossible for everyone to make enough money to pvp off of, someone has to lose out. i know i cant do it, even if i didn't donate my proceeds. absent communistic organization people need to make money.they do this in empire, because empire is the easiest and safest way to make cash. many players will have jump clones or alts in empire that, in a time of low war declaration, they can jump back to and run missions. this is less true in gs but certainly true. the other thing you have to understand is that there is a lot of bling that can go around. faction fit cnr will set you back a pretty penny, up that to an officer fit cnr and its even more. people play just to finish that line, viewing \"level 70\" as \"maxed skills with a faction fit\". same concept, different means of attaining it. a lot of people do the same, but with carriers/deads/motherships being their \"ideal ship\" and so, like anything else, they grind to it.darius is right in that there is nothing to do once you reach the top. but, as a game, that is just going to be something we have to accept, what other end game content can there be? in wow, its a loot grind in eve, its a loot grind. that is why eve stands out as a pvp game, because once you're on top its about staying on top. people end up playing for the experience and not for the grind.regarding your specific idea: all that is well and good, but aside from the research input good, you can just use minerals. the \"production method\" doesn't need to be created anew. the research input good needs to be separate so you can more easily balance the rate at which research occurs[and to make exploration more competitive]"
"perhaps i misunderstood you. are you dropping roles because you're trying to have more time for csm business, or are you dropping roles because you think it makes you more neutral?"
"greater than 1, less than 100in what terms? economically? see, here's the problem again, you keep generalising. what's important to one person might not necessarily be important to someone else.no, i'm perfect if i told you i was a brain surgeon how would you be able to disprove me? surebecause i am sick of people like you who hide in anonymity sniping from the shadows when you don't even have enough courage to run for the csm yourself. you open a can of worms and question the value of me, i will question he value of you. i'm not a punching bag. do some research about the csm and the people running for it before you start throwing out insults."
"so asking some rather straight forward questions of you in regard to what i feel is important for a csm is unacceptable for you? while at the same time i'm supposed to do research on the candidates, part of which is question asking. but when i do i get a bunch more defensive responses, and find myself trying to be made the issue?so basically, you want to run for csm, but you don't want to face any scrutiny? and anyone who does scrutinize you as a candidate, well there is obviously something wrong with them?"
"no, i'm happy for scrutiny, you just seem to not want to do any homework. everything you asked of me is available in my blog."
"then why did you not simply state, in your initial reply that i could find how mistaken i might be if i went and looked at your blog?"

"ghost training will lose ccp money, not get them more."
"i doubt the true effect of this farce will be known for 1 to 3 months. once people have stuck 30 or 60 days on expired accounts, waited for 29 days, then transferred chars to other accounts."
"i'm deployed, an have no issues paying to skill whether i can play or not.i'm all for the removal of ghosting. it was a great move, and looooong overdue. should have been in effect before carriers/moms/titans."
"i have never used ghost training (a phrase which didn't exist until ccp recently invented it) on either of my accounts. i never had any intention to do so.i do, however see the merits of it and it seemed like a great part of the service - another thing that set eve apart from all the other games.in order for someone to gain any benefit from \"ghost training\", they had to resubscribe. these are repeat customers.i think the decision to remove it was bad, overall, but that is as nothing compared to the way ccp handled it. in some ways similar to the handling of the t20 incident.in this case, they do something very unpopular which effectively downgrades the service people were used to for five years, then they pull any amount of garbage from thin air to explian why they did it... \"bug\", \"unintended\", \"a balance issue\"...then they massively censor anyone who tries to complain about it.this is hot on the heels of the gtc price-hike that was dressed up as being \"more efficient\" to have only 60 day cards... which suddenly cost more than two 30 day cards... but that's because eve is a \"premium product\", apparently.in neither case (gtc or ghost training) did they mention trying to maximise revenues - no hint of that at all."
"it wasn't, so let's penalise those that haven't trained up carrier 5 yet.btw, anyone wanna buy a char with carrier 5, fighters 5, adv drone inter 5, command ships 5, to name but a few of the stupidly long ones, trained?"
"this was quite a interesting post on the blog thread by gutta percha post no 4572;quoting;it's time to put this \"bug\" crap to rest once and for all.as a programmer of 45+ years i can see very clearly that this was never a bug. in fact, it had been the simplest, most elegant implementation of time-based \"training\" possible:for the type of training eve has had, several fields were added to the char info in the database:current skill: [database key of the skill]completion date/time: [date/time]any number of individual skill records subordinate to the char store the id of each skill and the sp or percentage of \"progress.\" the subordinate record for the current skill tracked in the char info doesn't have to be updated until examined at the next login, and then either set to \"completed\" or \"100%\", and then only if the skill step has been \"completed.\"if a skill is not actively paused, the static completion date/time means that a waiting period is being imposed. the skill step can only be used after the waiting period has expired. in reality, it's not \"training\" -- it's a wait. and not even a game wait. it's an out-of-game calendar wait.note that an entry in the database of a completion date/time requires no work. there is no actual ongoing process of \"training.\" rather, in the mechanics of the game, the training completion is a foregone conclusion that will be discovered at some future time when the eve client connects and discovers that the date/time for completion has passed.meanwhile, the apparency of ongoing training... the countdown and progress bar in the char sheet... are illusions created in the eve client.this mechanism for managing training that works by calendar/clock time instead of in-game actions is elegant. it requires no work or effort on the part of the servers. in fact, the server cluster could go up in smoke, a new cluster could be built over the course of days, weeks or a month, and in the end no \"training\" will have been lost because the \"training\" is not a process but merely a recorded completion date/time.now... an elegant mechanism like this is automatically going to \"train\" while you are offline and, yes, while you are unsubscribed. nothing is given away for free. everything needed has been paid for and done under an active subscription, and only the calendar waiting period must run its course before the skill step can be used. and then only if you actually log in again.this elegant mechanism was designed this way to minimize the impact of training on the servers. it's beautiful. anything different would be inelegant and probablly horrible.so now they have broken that elegant mechanism by the addition of new code... code that forcibly puts a skill into the \"paused\" state when an account is marked as inactive. this is more work for the servers than before. it is more work for the database than before. it is less elegant, less perfect, and wholly artificial.ccp is now penalizing us for something that formerly cost them nothing, and in doing so are going to extra effort, going out of their way to set training steps to a paused state. in effect they seek to charge us for a calendar waiting period for a skill we have already paid for and had to be active and online to initiate.end quote"

"capital smartbombs? really?!as tusko noted in another thread, the main applications for smartbombs are on capital ships. however, i do not agree that these are applications which should be having a lower barrier to entry. fine, if you wanna officer fit your super capital, fine. but i still don't agree with smartbombing on gates, killing frigates and pods without the ability to get away.smartbombs are also well-known to cause more lag than normal weapons.while i like variety, i don't think smartbombs are all that good to promote. ccp should spend their on balancing capitals rather than making them over-powered with giving them more smartbombs."
"while i agree that smartbombs aren't exactly as smart as their name intends and could do with some work to make them more versatile, i'm completely against the introduction of a capital sized smartbomb.looking at the footprint of a capital ship, it's sheer size effectively gives any smartbomb it has fitted a range bonus due to the way it's aoe is calculated.for their purpose, capitals already have sufficient firepower in terms of fighters for carriers, and turrets with siege mode for dreads. if the argument is that they can't defend themselves against smaller ships or swarms of drones and fighers, then it's a moot and completely void point, due to the fact that capitals are not and should never be solo pwn mobiles. they're designed to be deployed with support to defend them, and in multiple numbers to assist eachother.looking at supercapitals, i'll say the same about them as the standard capitals. again, they're not designed to be deployed solo. the benefits of owning and deploying them, such as a clonebay, massive hangars, sheer hitpoints, remote logistics potential and invulnerability to just about every flavour of ew out there far outweigh the distadvantages, and the main offset is that they need to be babysat when deployed into an engagement.looking at it simply, there's one type of capital that already has a capital smartbomb, with four flavours for your intended race of training. that's powerful enough, and restricted enough with it's anchoring effect on the ship for 10 minutes, and it's inability to be fired in lowsec to be balanced.capitals and capital gangs have never been about \"the little guys\". they're designed for terratorial disputes. they're designed for big space claiming entities to show their muscle and support their fleets in sieges on static structures such as stations and control towers.from what i can see in their design, although they're being used and lost in such a manner, it's never been inherent in the way they've been thought out for them to be a platform to support a small gang on the field. perhaps from a distance, assigning fighters yeah, but not on the front line where there's little to no direct support.i can't see how adding a capital smartbomb would be something that would benefit the capital classes at all. there are already tools there for the defense of capitals, nullsec alliances have proved this time and time again by pulling them out of the ****.a agree smartbombs do need work. what would i like to see?a standard vanilla module, in the form of a micro, small, medium and large smartbomb with their current ranges per size, that do a limited amout of all four damage types (a lot less than the current hit that a damage specific bomb will do.)add the ability to script it in two ways, to boost it's range and give it a larger aoe, while maintaining the same relatively weak blast of all four damage types, or to focus the module to produce a single damage type with a magnified amount of base damage traded off for much higher cap useage.how would this be useful and balanced?the increase in range is offset by the fact that the damage is relatively low, however there is still the possiblity of stacking the modules to create a larger effect if you want to sacrifice the highslots.the increase in damage for the focused module means that a pilot can focus his damage types against the targets he's tryin to destroy, however he has to have the knowledge and ability to micromanage his targets and know what the hell he's doing, or his scripted modules are worth nothing.i'd far rather see this, over the introduction of a rack of highslot modules for a capital ship that is effectively a \"/pwn\" button.no doubt i'll get flamed (as usual), and accused of being biased and posting only to troll you (as usual), but the plain fact of the matter is that i simply think there are better alternatives than jumping in feet first with an xl aoe weapon."
"against the nerf passionately. it kills close range combat, roaming gangs and renders fragile ships useless alpha fodder."
"against. so... if you have no ideea how to pvp just make a blob and win, yee for the lag that comes with numbers. i agree that snakes schould be nerfed but the this is way too much, that a noob in an insured bs stays and only activates modules. this is the pvp you wont???i certanly do not and will not."
"cruise missiles even with the speed nerf still cannot hit anything. the things it can hit has so much effective hp that stealth bombers are utterly useless and easily defeated.bombs are roughly 15-20million per bomb... it takes 3+ to kill anything. so you literally are spending nearly 100mil just to get kills... that's just totally nuts.next bombs are very hard to predict. you are plausibly going to kill yourself or your friends along with the enemy.i dont know how ccp are going to adjust bombs... but honestly the cruise missiles need adjusting to make them alpha kill virtually all untanked frigates. or drop cruise missiles entirely and give stealth bombers citadel torps who then are used in antibs-capital warfare. which is big value and not overpowered. 30 second rof with only about 10,000 alpha dmg only able to effectively hit battleships or larger."
"bombs need to be improved to increase usage. also has anyone noticed that the sb's have 7 bonus'? two for class frig, two more for cov ops, and three for role. yet still not alot of players fly these ships mainstream. very very niche ship that is outclassed by other more capable and cheap ships.i would like to see it given either warp while cloaked or the ability to target while cloaked whilst also having the missiles damage while cloaked. i believe this would give the ship the survivability edge without boosting hp's. would also encourage a \"wolf pack\" mentality thus grouping players together in order to kill larger targets."

"sorry, no, the question is nonsensical. there's no trade-off. the \"interests\" to which you refer are not supported at the expense of anyone else. sp and rp are not zero-sum mechanisms. look up the term. most of the things nonthinking people think are zero-sum are actually not.you fail again. don't try to design things you don't know how to design. a simple rule would prevent the problem you mistakenly believe would occur: keep absentee training as it is, but the queue doesn't kick in while you're suspended. that would give us a queue but keep unsub training just as it has been for 5 years. see how easy that was?you also seem to be confused about what constitutes \"playing.\"i won't go into rp as it isn't my thing, but training sps are bought and paid for the moment you click to initiate the training step. there is no ongoing training activity -- it's an illusion. there is only a completion date/time, which only means you can't use the benefit of the skill step before that time, and whether you \"play\" or not in the meantime is completely irrelevant. therefore whether you pay in the meantime should also be irrelevant."

"i hereby propose that the *log-off timer* when aggro'd be increased to 2-3 minutes. i dare say 3-5 minutes would be more appropriate but increasing it 2-3 minutes would be a significant blow to the *log off* tactic.discuss."
"supporting anything to get rid of logoffski bs."
"all true and good. however, there is no way to gauge if someone has logged off, or has a genuine ctd. until such time that the server can differentiate between \"logofski\" and \"ctd\" how can anyone support this?"
"how can you not support a fix to an exploit used by so many every day?"
"signed, all for the exploit to get fixed, whether it's regarded as one."
"if you ctd-sorry, not my problem, fix your computer.eve is a pretty stable game and internet lately is also quite stable. if a few people end up losing their ships due to a legit dc (a very few) to stop this exploit then it's still worth it."
"thats the thing, i agree that if the bugger logs off, he deserves the best spanking he can get. but, you can't say \"fix your computer\" - especially if the client is defective. i play on a mac now, and mac client has stability issues, and it is certainly not my mac. so it happens that the whole client collapses into a heap, and i have to restart the computer to start the client again... which is plain weird. thats the problem i have, i want to punish those who do it on purpose, and at the same time i want to be protected when the genuine issue happens to me, or to others. what do i 'sign' then? and how do i vote?"
"supported!!! maybe freighters would finally stop flying through lowsec with impunity..."
"i'd watch"
"i like the idea of planetary assets being about production (and consumption) npc trade goods. optimal production chains should be spread across regions on planets in multiple systems (got to give company haulers, independant traders and pirates the opportunity), and demand for trade goods should have components that vary randomly across time and space - from 48-hour fads to 3-month fluctuations.the new system would need to be isk-neutral in the long run: the theoretical ideal profit from the whole system produce - and - sell - back - to - npcs cycle minus the asset taxes should be zero or slightly positive (whatever ccp thinks is a good isk source level).maybe a well-organised group of players would be able to set it up as an isk source, but they'd be pulling the isk from other players who aren't doing so well. players might actually want to subsidise unprofitable ventures just for the fun of it, which would create an isk sink.so, if its not guaranteed to net you any isk, why would you do it ?boasting rights and role-play: you would be the governor of a planetary region: amarrians could aspire to be holders, minmatar family/clan leaders, caldari megacorp installation/regional managers, gallente regional senate representatives or local leaders; and out in 0.0 players can call themselves whatever they like. in lowsec it could be related to fw by only allowing new \"types\" of regional governor (eg amarrian holder) to aquire assets when the appropriate faction is in control of the system. in nullsec it could be related to sovereignty levels (or whatever they get replaced with)."
"there are some really good concepts in this thread, but there are also a few problems.1) would the trade good be based entirely on npc demand? if so, people could (somewhat justly) claim favoritism by ccp for modifying the market in a way that is not in their favor.the answer to this is to make all trade goods, from reports to exotic dancers, usable in the game in one fashion or another. people could use scientists (if they could train them up using special re-education facilities) and frozen food, as will soon be posted on my website. i sense there are some major manufacturing changes coming from ccp in the next patch, so we'll have to see.2) can the planet become a dedicated producer of t1 items or even named t1 items? this would open the market up greatly, as somebody (with enough research, isk, and time) could start manufacturing x5 webbers, throwing a massive fork into the gears of the ccp economy.i think the stations should be able to be taken over, but in a completely different field. maybe by bribing the officials of the city with luxury goods (spiced wine and long-limb roes, for instance). this would create a whole new form of piracy, and a new career in the game (as it were)."
"i've advocated for years changes in the markets for fundamental [npc] goods.{my original quest was to rationalize the items purchased by npc stations so that the items purchased are reasonable inputs to the items they produce. example: producing robotics should require electronic parts as an input. related effect: if no one brings ep to the station to sell, the station should cease producing robotics, and it should raise the price it is offering for ep.}while the \"buy a planet based enterprise\" proposal addresses potential increases in output [via the expansion and efficiency improvement routes], it does not discuss potential increases in demand. those demand increases should be necessary to avoid increased output driving down prices.as i see it, we capsuleers are a very small minority of the overall human population in eve. each populated planet in eve likely has between 50 million and 20 billion human inhabitants, plus those who live in nearby space.thus, the total volume of trade by and between the planets should be enormous. the few convoys we see are only the tip of the iceberg -- all npc corps must have fleets of freighters dedicated to hauling goods between planets.this suggests that prices should be quite stable -- the volume that capsuleers can haul, even in a freighter, is small compared to a system's likely total demand.populations tend to grow or shrivel based on factors which are not modeled in eve at all. economies grow in per capita output and demand as well. these are also inputs into volume and pricing models and thus markets. technical analysis of markets may become possible, but fundamental analysis will not be."
"absolutely."
"agreed. actually, i'm a little surprised that the skill level doesn't unlock the ability to build tech ships by tier. for example, look at battleship construction. you don't need the skill at all to build a dominix, megathron, or hyperion, but you *do* need it at level *4* to build a kronos. what's up with that? doesn't it seem more plausible that you'd need level 1 to build a tier 1 battleship (dominix), level 2 to build a tier 2 battleship (megathron), level 3 to build a tier 3 battleship (hyperion), level 4 for the tech 2 battleship (kronos - yeah yeah, it's a marauder...)?so, in line with other posters, i'd say a small time efficiency bonus (2% sounds reasonable) per level, plus ability to build the corresponding tier ships.but i may be reprising something that someone else has already beaten to death -- i confess i haven't scanned the topics.mdd"
"yup"
"very farmer-friendly, not necessarily fair. cant say i want."
"then remove it. if i can train other characters, i wouldn't have to buy them. and i disagree about the capital pilots, along with some other non-capital pilots, i imagine.no other mmo has a single shard universe either, are you suggesting they should change that? in other words, i always thought of 'most people do this' as lame argument.and what is character farming and isk farming and how is this done, and how is this affected by the requested change? saying character farming 10 times without the how and why isn't going to convince me.why would i want to stop you?what? we are not talking about ghost training here.i could live with this.i not sure why, but i'm getting this: \"the bottom line is money, nobody gives a ****!\"vibe.i mean, it is possible to train 2 or more characters and have all the benifits of 'isk/character farming' and being able to do 'everything'. you only have to pay for it. so only poor people who only have one account are not able to have these 'benifits', which kind of goes against one of ccp's concepts of equality regardless of real world wealth. like it isn't enough that people who pay more(have more accounts) have more votes for the csm. (democracy?)"
"you're right, using a 'most people' do this argument is lame, notice how the op is using it i was merely pointing out that the op is wrong in his statement.character farming is paying to train a character up and then selling them on for isk, one of the accepted methods for trading rl money(in terms of the time taken to train) for isk. having multiple training on accounts would allow everybody to theoretically farm 2 of these characters for free. and of course, as pointed out, absolutely everybody and their dog would be able to train an industrial alt, mining alt, cloaking alt, invention alt etc. whatever happened to the 'multiplayer' element of mmo's?edit: cos i fail at quoting"
"well i can see both sides of the argument here.and i think i have a more palatable solution.have one character flagged as main. that character trains as normal.alt1 and no alt 2 would train at half speed.alt1 and alt 2 would train at 25% speed.this keeps characters down in skill points rather then boosting as the other person suggested. which should make ccp happier. it will still keep the alts under control and should stop character farmers from going to nuts."
"they can do what ever they want with this game they own it but.if you create the csm for beter communication with the player base and then dont use that tool for this kind of things it becomes a liewhe can argue about ghost training but its there call. but the communication style lieng and cheating that is what should be stoped by the csm"
"wait, what? what kind of logic is this?the csm hasn't had a chance to get together for a meeting yet, in order to discuss ghost training.yet, you deduce because ccp hasn't changed their mind, that the csm is useless?wow, awesome logic. seriously"
"i was thinking about the way i used to ghost train, i have a main (this one) who i have subscribing almost continually for the entire of the chars life (just oevr 4 yrs) and i have an alt who i sub when i can afford it.now what i always did was sub for a month, train in a specific fiel duntil lv5, get in a few small sills and then set a lv5 going and cancel the sub.yes am sure alot of peopel did this but, with having that lv5 skill trainign it always gave me sumthing to come back to at the end of (max 38days so far) now tho, i cant afford to continually sub the char and with the skill not training i have nothing to make me sub again after a month or so.so what happens is, i had a contnual main and then i semi subbed a char for 6 months of the year. now tho i may only sub it in a coupel months time when i find a reason to or maybe even just sell/delete the char all together so ccp have gone from having 100% sub and a 50% sub to just a 100% sub and maybe a 10-25% sub, losing <U+FFFD>135 from me (losing 9 months subs) if that happens with 500 people then the costs soon start to mount up (<U+FFFD>67,500)maybe allow us to have a certain cut rate price for an alt (account linking) yeah liek power of 2 but maybe summat continually so ccp still get more cash and those that used to be as fair as possibly can with ghost trainign can afford to run an alt too."
"training an account that you don't pay for is cheating imo. i'm glad ccp removed this way for you to gain an unfair advantage over people who actually pay for all their accounts.imo csm should congratulate ccp for taking this action and ask why they didn't do it sooner."
"actually, i think that what will happen when csm delivers its questions to ccp would really decide for me, and should for you, what csm is all about. until csm actually does something we can't say whether they were effective, or were ignored. the only gripe i have with csm is that with the exception of couple of members csm has been very quiet on their interactions with ccp, whether as some say due to nda, or other issues, the appearance is there that the were/are ineffectual. this is what should change with next csm, i hope. as far as the issue reflected in this thread: csm should make a joint statement - all members together - as to what has been discussed with ccp. unless, of course, ccp invokes the nda thing again, or vetoes the discussion outright. till then, they should have a benefit of the doubt."
"i have two accounts, one for mining and one for combat skilling. i have been able to maintain both by buying time codes with mining isk, and it had been working fine. now, time code prices have climbed past the 1/2 billion mark, and continue to rise, and my plan was to ghost train one account for 20 days to catch up, but obviously now that's not an option. what is left as an option is to combine my mains into one account and try to maintain. eve is becoming more like a job than a diversion. not fun."
"the game has evolved over the last 5 years and with it many concepts have changed and the play of the game as also changed.i think it is past time for ccp to put a team togeather and go through the ships and better define the roles of the various ship classes and the ships themselves.many ships had certain roles in mind that they just don't do well at anymore. or the role itself is broken or useless.it is time for a good hard look at each ship class and role and make sure every ship fits somewhere and has a purpose.there are many ships that are just not flown or are flown so rarely as to be non existiant in the game.this should be looked at ship by ship and fixed so that every ship has a role and abilities that assist that role. the roles should be based on what current players use them for and what ccp wants them used for. not just one side or the other."
"43475.0"
"that does not make any sense at all.can i mail you some lead and you turn it into gold for me? very small change, actually. not often done though, as far as i was told.what you are asking for would require full scale matter transformation and if that existed in eve, there would be no need whatsoever to take anything specific. you could make tritatium out of air, dust, rock, water, or orange juice."
"it would be nice if pos's could be fueled by orange juice. much better tasting then plane old heavy water."
"actually in all 0.0 regions you can get some of every mineral from rat loot. you just can't mine it all. drones drop everything of course.melting down 1600mm plates may not get you enough megacyte for a bs quickly but don't underestimate its effects. especially on low ends rat loot is a larger source of minerals than mining."
"what have the csm accomplished so far?giving us an actual rundown of what the first csm have done for us would make us more, or less, inclined to vote for a 2nd council."
"are you meaning things which has maked it into the game? is that what you want a rundown of?"
"actual changes or planned changes or features yes. ccp being aware of your concerns means very little to the average voter."
"well. when you try to use that kind of logic you immediately hit a brick wall.things don't happen over night. ccp has said this times and times again. it might take another year before the features we have requested actually sees the light.however, several things already made it onto sisi:- mini-freighter(it's model is there, but the full ship will be here by the winter)- store fronts- ui fixes(tons of them!)and there's probably more to come as we see the full extent of this expansion."
"until you take credit and credit is confirmed from ccp people not in the know, on council or in close contact with those who are will think nothing substantial has come from it and election figures will be even less than last time around."
"i frankly agree we did discuss with ccp about adding a small icon in patch-notes for all items which were raised by the csm. it seems like a great idea to me.however, they later refused that because they thought it would become a \"****ing contest\""
"simply don't put any names on it, just add the csm stamp."
"i *must* assume that would certainly be the case. however, you could get into a ****ing contest by comparing who had most csm items in the patch notes during their term.i still think it's a silly argument."
"i don't see a problem there, something to work towards then, improving the game as much as possible. i'm sure people can settle claims of solutions that are not exclusive for one csm and you'd both get on that golden killmail."
"im more than willing to give the csm time to make changes for the better considering the stubborn non approachability of the gm's etc change for the better takes time and considering the pit the powers that be in the game have dug hemselves the work involved to rectify must be enormous,csm keep up the good work i really appreciate what you are trying to achieve"
"attention to suicide ganking - even if they already had changes planned, us putting it on the agenda certainly pulled it forward several months.making faction warfare missions easier, based on the feedback in our documents.alliance participation in factional warfare should be there soon, they're definately working on it now."
"don't settle for commenting on this thread, it needs to be out there in the election, repeated over and over as to notify the voters that things do happen."
"actually, meeting notes for all meetings should be posted. players can see what issues were voted to ccp from these (although i am pushing for a clearer record of issues escalated/discussed in future). there are still a number of meeting minutes missing, which is not desirable.the trouble with highlighting csm issues that make it in game;the csm doesn't really act as a cohesive unit when it election time comes near- you'll see csm members reeling off their raised issues that made it into game. trouble with this is that many issues were brought to csm attention via forums, or were issues that have been about for a long time (and may have been already in the process of being fixed). also, it required more than one csm member to vote it through. additionally, candidates that haven't been on the csm or alternates have a distinct disadvantage for the elections if this occurs, especially for new voters looking through campaign materials.now, you might think this isn't major. i'd agree with a csm stamp etc if the csm members/alts agreed not to use it in electioneering. afterall, the csm is there to serve players, not further individual interests.take care,arithron"
"i don't care who tries to use the results to further their own campaign, what i'm concerned with is that results are presented as to give the voters an incentive to vote at all."
"that's what meeting minute notes and effective communication is for.take care,arithron"
"i'm still working on that wiki which contains all our issues, our votes, the status of the issues, and what ccp has been doing with it, and i'm sure i'll have it ready before next voting round starts."
"at best they have helped push eve further in the direction of a mostly pve empire based game."
"ccp also share responsibility for posting minutes, and one csm member shouldn't be responsible for such a wiki alone (as its a large job that could be shared out)!take care,arithron"
"you've got proof to support this outrageous claim?"
"i name most of my ships. my mission running dominix is named \" stargate (fck-u) \"my cnr is named uss mudkipzthis is because i really dont have strategic need to name them anything specific.if i were in low sec. i would use default name for my 2400 omni dps tank myrmidon. i would cruise around in belts ratting; waiting for pirates to attack me. my gang would then jump into the belt and have fun with them. the myrmidon ratting in belt, 1 jump from high sec looks aweful newby and on top of that... my ships name is default crappy named? juicy and easy kill is plastered all over the screen.so i think the default name is best."
"i like this idea..."
"signed"
"the topic pretty much says it already.there are so many cool ships in the game that we cannot fly, because they are not available. it would be great if more of them were available as faction ships. since the models are already there, it would be little effort to make them available to players.with the significant presence of tech ii ships, it would also be great if there were tech ii versions of the faction ships."
"i just want faction battlecruisers and destroyers.there was sum talk that more faction ships was going to be introduced but all we've seen so far are the new navy versions of the osprey, omen, exqueror and scythe.discussion has been going on for bout 2 yrs now of more faction ships tho"
"i believe we did in fact discuss this with ccp just a little over a week ago. please keep an eye out for the minutes from this."
"ah hell ...faction myrmidon and faction drake ftw./signed."
"i think faction \"industrial\" ships are in order! like... \"imperial freighters\" or something. anyway, more faction ships = good. whatever they are."

"dev on jita park has called for candidates to link their thread into a sticky. official list will be published soon, but there are already info threads where you can see external site links, platforms, and ask questions of candidates..take care,arithron"
"not so fast, pls. suppose the quantity of mineable minerals is in the high hundreds to low thousands of hours. [there are about 740 hours in a month.]as soon as you put up a moon miner and begin production, you'd know how long you have on that moon. but, no one else would know.is this still a valuable target? yes. if you're practicing economic warfare. and it probably is if you've been watching, know the moon miner went up recently and therefore the deposit remaining is likely large.besides, who said the goal here is to make things easy for would be attackers? as it is, things are already easy for them -- each pos is a target, they have unlimited economic life, and they can't move. all you have to do is bring up enough dreads to defeat any weapons and then outwait the limited amount of sc the tower can hold. if you can defeat the oppo's fleet -- you have an assured conquest.as to putting pos on all moons -- unless you're trying to assure system sovereignty, this is too expensive. even a small pos with defenses costs seeral hundred million isk. operating just one small one costs on the order of 7 to 10 million per week.now, maybe your outfit can afford to spend some billions to cover all the moons in a single system and can keep them running at a cost of 350 million or more isk per week. i'm thinking that most moon mining ops can't begin to make that sort of income and so people won't do that."

"i always viewed this csm thingy as a pure pr stunt. if ccp was genuinely interested in knowing their customer's opinions, it would simply require adding the pertinent front-end to a database-driven polling system and bang, they could have their cross-referenced stats, on as many subjects and how often it would be deemed opportune.if ccp was also genuinely interested in eve player's grey matter, an equivalent system could be put at disposal of the community to allow polls on player's issued proposals in the spirit to perfect or add new features to the game.instead they came up with the principle of a consultative representative body. well, \"representative\" bodies are just that: an imperfect snapshot limited to the opinion of those (positively) interested (since you don't get the option to vote against the csm), with no implicit guarantees that the peeps you vote for will act as you wish. the \"consultative\" part is even more cute. basically this means: we might listen to the csm in areas we don't really care or view as critical.that's why i consider all this crap a monument of futility & deception. but maybe i'm wrong. hence i'm interested not in who will get elected, but in the participation rate. imho, i expect the number of voters vs the number of active accounts to be lower than the first time.only time will tell"
"i think you are right. i really hope that we see an increase in actual % voters of the userbase. however, at this point it seems like we have don't have very many candidates at all.maybe people realized it's not an easy task to be a csm member. however, if there becomes less and less people who wants to run for csm, we might have a problem.i'm sure we will always have enough interest in the csm to make it \"relevant\". i and several other members of the council have taken initiative to get onto things like eve radio, podcasts and even places like eve-mag.com, in order to increase awareness. i hope it pays off and we will see at least 15% turnout."
"i personally don't agree with changing the skill system given the information that we have. it's been that way for a long time and i think that the people it will impact the most will not be some evil cheaters out to game the system, but returning players and casual players taking a break who legitimately want to return to the game and now will be less likely to do so.could there have been greater reason than what was given in the blog? certainly, however the communication made by ccp was lacking in details and the amount of notice was inadequate. it was a change that was slammed down hard and fast with no opportunity for people to prepare to digest the bad taste in their mouths before receiving the consequences and that's a terrible place to leave a customer. i'd posit that it's the exact opposite of what you'd want a customer interaction to be.firstly, i don't think that, rp aside, anyone \"griefs because they want to make someone move to 0.0\". that would be silly. getting your things destroyed or having your fun ruined isn't going to make you want to leave your crib. it is my firm belief that people will move to 0.0 when it becomes worth it to them. right now the reward vs. risk is completely off. there is simply not enough money to be made, at least by the casual observer, in 0.0 to make it worth their while for the people residing in empire to move. it is my belief that 0.0 needs to be incentivized in order for that to happen. people will band together and take more risks when the payoff makes it worth it. today the only payoff is a spot on the map for the most part and marginally better ratting space and asteroids. woo hoo."
"firstly, there wasn't a lot of csm time spent on the issue. it passed with a relatively low degree of feedback. secondly, it's a forgone conclusion that walking in stations is going to occur. if we were asked whether or not it should occur i may very well have said \"no\" considering the status of various other aspects of the game, but the fact is that it is going to occur. given that we will have walking in stations fairly soon what is the harm of proposing something interesting to do while... \"walking in stations?\". the developer time is already being spent on it and if it wasn't playing music they were coding in it would just be something else. neither goonfleet nor goonswarm have ever officially stated we wish to \"destroy eve\", least of all \"from the inside\". there may have been statements made to that effect by individuals in the heat of anger, but that certainly hasn't been a motivation of the entire organization. as i said in my last election thread, our intention is to play a fun game and hopefully improve it for everyone. our motivation is to play a good game. as far as working towards making a joke out of the csm or ccp... well i think that my fellow members of the council and ccp reps would have to agree that while we may have some disagreements about certain things, and some differences in how we choose to express them, i've been a valuable and contributing part of the process. i've done nothing to earn a mantle of disruption. i want a fun and engaging game to play. that's it and that's all.i've supported a number of issues which made it through the last csm. as a matter of fact i supported a large majority of what was passed. my major concerns are, of course always going to be the aspects of the game i'm most heavily involved in, pvp and 0.0 warfare. however, that hasn't prevented me from supporting and providing input on other issues. a singular accomplishment that i could point to would be the 0.0 rountables which will happen at fanfest. after seeing the way the discussions were going and how 0.0-based solutions were getting to the council it occurred to me that the only way we were going to get any headway was by forming some degree of a consensus. i thought that the best way to at least begin this process would be a pair of roundtables during fanfest, so i sent a letter to ccp stating exactly that, and i'm happy that they've decided to add these roundtables to the docket. i had proposed that we have one for people currently living in 0.0, to express their gripes, concerns and desires and one roundtable for people who aren't in 0.0 to express why they're not and help gauge what types of changes would make it more attractive.i'll continue in an additional post as work is calling and i'm almost out of room."
"to answer this i'll simply point to my previous answer regarding your similar question. the idea that we want to destroy eve is a rather oft. repeated propaganda ploy. nothing more. while they certainly cannot weigh in or express their support in this regard i think anyone whom i've dealt with at ccp would attest to my devotion to the cause of bettering ccp and eve online.while i have made the mistake at times of using a hammer to solve a problem which could have been better handled with something lighter, i've never shown any indication in any way regarding my status of a csm of anything other than the best intentions. we're not always going to agree on the solution to various problems but a part of the exercise is to be able to voice those opinions, have them heard and to have a dialogue about them."
"my visionon november 14th of last year, i was logged in to change skills and update my research lines, when a corpmate mentioned a new dev blog about something called the \"council of stellar management\". i had no idea what he was talking about, so i went onto the website and looked up the dev blog. inside, i found a 20 page chunk of political philosophy shoehorned into the mold of a computer game. in it also lay the soul of eve. i do not believe that ccp set out to make a game when they designed eve, and i do not believe that they think in terms of making a game today. of course, they do so superficially, but at its heart, ccp has built a world for us to play in, rather than merely a game for us to play with. market share, player enjoyment, and all the rest matter, but they're secondary to building a world that feels real and that makes sense as a world. concessions to gameplay exist - infinite supplies of enemies, respawning asteroids in belts 50 km wide, and so on - but they always feel like it's a guilty failure of vision, not like it's a gleeful attempt to fit within the mould laid down by others. so it was here. ccp did not talk about player input into the game as a feature, they talked about it as a natural right of individuals living in a civilization. their goal was to create a \"deliberative democracy\" to allow the will of the people to express itself to the government. of course, it contained the usual ccp excesses - a grand document they spent huge amounts of time on with promises they still haven't delivered on a year later, wikipedia footnotes, and half-completed proofreading - but in this case it truly is the thought that counts. the thought, in this case, was the thought that makes democracy a functional system of government in worlds both real and virtual. individuals tend to be intelligent and thoughtful, often making better decisions in large groups than even the best individual can, and they tend to work for their own good and the good of those around them. the csm is an attempt to harness the power of democracy to improve eve, and as such it is one of the more ambitious experiments ccp has ever attempted, but given the experimentally observed effects of democracy in the real world, it also has the potential to be one of their greatest successes. it is our responsibility as players to ensure that this potential is not squandered because of us. not merely because some would consider it a moral obligation, but because we will be the ones who benefit from a game that harnesses the power of democracy to better itself. if we care about the future of the game, we ought to get involved in shaping that future as best we can. we should become informed, we should be active in the political life of our society, and we should try to use our powers of reason, persuasion, and voting to attempt to enact the changes we see as being the most beneficial. we should stand up for what we believe in because we believe in it. this is what i have attempted to do as a member of the eve universe ever since the council of stellar management became a reality this april. i gathered information, read the platform of every candidate who had one, and cast my vote for the candidate who i believed had the best vision to take the game forward. i have been involved in the csm's processes from the beginning, being probably the most active player in the csm-specific forums, and having done what i can at every point to aid the csm's internal processes, participating in everything from the keeping list of topics raised updated to creating archive threads for past csm information to participating in virtually every discussion of how the csm can improve its ways of doing business."
"the only way i have not attempted to participate thus far is by being a candidate standing for election, and now is the time to change that. i have a strong agenda for the future that i genuinely believe will make the game a better one for everybody, and i believe that my vision is shared by enough other players that i can make a real difference in eve going forward. as such, it is time for me to take that final leap and stand for election as a councilor. my slogan is a simple one - \"experience. dedication. clarity.\" - but it encapsulates the core of my campaign and my beliefs. i have more experience with the csm than most other candidates in this race, having been as involved as a non-member can be since day one, and having a significant amount of experience with similar bodies in the real world. i am fiercely dedicated to fulfilling my responsibilities to others, and i will never shirk them or abandon them because it's too hard or too boring. and i believe strongly in a series of measures designed to improve clarity in the csm (rules of order and improved resources for players to understand what we are doing) and in eve (a wide array of improvements to the user interface and to documentation of how the game works). my beliefs are more complex than that, as any person's are, but that is the core of why i am running and what i will do if the players entrust me with a seat on the council. i do not run because i think i can bend the game to my will, or because i think i will be able to dictate terms to ccp. the csm is an advisory body, not a legislature, and it must act as one. there are things that cannot be done due to limited resources, things that will not be done due to the developers having responsibilities to ccp shareholders that take precedence over their responsibilities to eve players, and things that will be done very differently than we propose because of the rounds of testing that ideas must go through before they are made into final changes to the game. however, we as players have one great advantage offsetting the limitations i just described - ccp genuinely does care. they may do boneheaded things from time to time - the fact that eve was not intended as a game shows up in negative ways as well as positive - and i will attack them when that happens. but at the end of the day, ccp loves this game as much as any player, because it is both their passion and their child. they want to see what is best for eve, and they have entrusted us as players with a major role in that process. it is our responsibility to ensure that we work with the developers, that we advise them to the best of our collective ability, and that we do what is best for eve. and with your help, that is precisely what i intend to spend the next six months doing. thank you."
"policy  csm internalthe first csm has been a success in many ways, but it has also been plagued with a large number of problems with how things are done, and if i am elected i will make a priority of identifying and fixing as many of these problems as possible. here are the primary issues with the csm's internal mechanics that i see at present.one of the saddest things about watching how the previous csm has done business over the last four months has been seeing how badly the council itself was run. there have been long, protracted fights over the nature of the chairman's powers, whether or not members have the right to abstain from a vote, and several other similar minor procedural matters of no importance to anybody.the reason for this is simple - the last council never specified rules of order of any sort, and as such any time a debate over how to conduct business came up, they had no way to decide except internal wrangling. the results of this are as obvious as they are inevitable - gridlock on procedural matters, with the only way to break it being to shout the loudest. this was bad for one term of office, but it would be worse if it were to continue for a second.as such, i pledge to bring up a vote to establish rules of order for future use at the first meeting of the new csm. my preference is for robert's rules of order, since they are both widely used and freely available, and i have a great deal of past experience with them, but i will accept any rules that the rest of the council feels comfortable with so long as they are comprehensive and usable.almost as fundamental as rules of order is the issue of how meetings are conducted. at present, the requirement to make meetings happen in a chat channel is causing an immense amount of scheduling problems, and that is with the csm being made up of seven europeans and two americans, with a total time zone spread of only seven hours. the difficulties omber zombie has had making meetings are unfortunate, but he was only an alternate this time - how ugly would scheduling be if he, or another person in australia or east asia, were a full member whose schedule had to be accommodated? this is a game played worldwide, and the problem of scheduling meetings is not a trivial one under those circumstances.between this and the issues of meetings getting longer and members having to leave midway through them, a new process for conducting csm meeting should be looked into. specifically, i will look into the possibility of moving csm votes away from chat channels and towards a forum-based system. these forums will be publicly accessible, although the actual voting threads will be limited to csm members and alternates, to allow for uninterrupted debate to take place. i am aware that the current structure of the official eve forums cannot accommodate this at present, unfortunately, and thus one of two alternative methods for doing this will have to be looked at. my understanding is that ccp is working on the long-overdue overhaul to the forums, and if this is the case then i would like to work with ccp to ensure that the new forum software has the ability to do what we would like it to for this purpose. failing that, however, the option of using off-site forums for this task will be implemented."
"another point of contention in the past has been the method of selecting the chair. the rules specify that the person receiving the most votes in the election is chair, but the election measures who would make the best representative, not who would make the best person to run meetings. as such, i will encourage whoever finishes first in the election to step aside as chair as soon as possible, and hold a vote inside the csm on who will be the new chair. if i am elected chair, i will resign immediately following the vote on rules of order and hold an election to fill the role.it should be easier in future for players unfamiliar with the csm and its processes to get at what they want to know, without having to sort through the chaos of the forums. as such, i will work to establish new threads of reference materials for stickying on the assembly hall and jita park speakers corner. i have already made one thread in this vein - an archive of past csm submissions - and i will work with the rest of the csm to figure out what a handful of other useful threads would be for reference, to allow players to quickly find what they want to know without flooding the boards with stickies of dubious utility. my inclinations are to a thread on jpsc linking meeting agendas, a thread on jpsc linking the items approved for submission in the next submission to ccp, and a thread on ah linking all topics to be discussed at the upcoming meeting, as well as the one i have already posted. this is subject to discussions with the rest of the csm and ccp's approval, however.there have been problems over the past term with issues being raised multiple times after they were rejected the first time. while this is not necessarily a bad thing, it is important to ensure that it is not used to flood meetings with proposals the council will not pass merely because one member feels strongly about it. as such, i will propose a rule that no topic may be brought back to the council after being rejected unless it is raised by a member who voted against it previously. if no new member is supporting it then it cannot pass, and as such the council should not waste its time with it.finally, it should be ensured that players have access to all the discussions of the csm, and that they are all easy to find. this should ultimately be done by ccp on the official site, but it hasn't been thus far, and i will work to find the problem that has stopped the chatlogs and minutes from being posted on the official site and fix it. the role of providing resources to players can also be fulfilled by third-party means, and this was well done for the first month by serenity steele with his www.eve-csm.com site, but that site's abandonment has left the csm with no third-party site to host meeting minutes on, leaving us with the stopgap measure of jade constantine using his corporate forums as a de facto csm site. while this is certainly better than nothing, and his willingness to do this is appreciated, it is not how things should be operating, and it should be fixed as soon as possible. i will ensure that an effective, stable third-party site for the csm exists for player reference. i believe that with the above changes, the csm will function much more effectively, and spend less time fighting over procedure and more time representing the players to ccp, which is the function that this body ultimately exists for."
"policy  user interfacei will begin by giving credit where credit is due - ccp has been consistently improving the user interface for years. changes ranging from contracts to the align to button to the drone changes that have been happening for years now to dozens of others have made the user's experience better and made the game consistently more playable. and apparently more is coming in the midas expansion, with a lot of changes to science and industry. however, as much as the game has been changing for the better, it hasn't been changing nearly fast enough. internet game reviewer ben \"yahtzee\" croshaw said it best: and, whether you trust his reviews or not, his response fits well with what i've heard from many other people i've tried to bring into the game. i have yet to come across anyone who wasn't an eve veteran who thought the ui was anything better than marginally usable, and after two years i still only find it adequate. ccp may have a team of ui programmers, but there are limits on what three or four people can do for a game as sprawling as eve with as bad of a ui as it has, especially given that this isn't changes to an alpha test version but instead to a long-deployed game. they need to come up with improvements, and they need to work within a pile of code that they can't just rip up and change, and they have to do this without annoying any significant number of people. it's not surprising that they're moving slowly, but it is immensely frustrating. this is not a phrase i will utter very often, but this is a field where eve could stand to learn quite a lot from world of warcraft. i have never played wow myself, but i know a lot of people who do, and all of them rave about the utility of user-created user interface modifications. you want to move buttons around, you can download a quick little file that will do so, and all of a sudden the ui is exactly the way you want it, without the developers ever having to lift a finger. as with most other forms of distributed problem-solving, it works incredibly well. players with programming skill go into the ui, fix whatever problem annoys them, and then post the patch on a central website for others to use. you need one person to make a change and the whole community benefits from it. of course, eve does not have the same size of player base as wow, but a quarter of a million people will contain one who gets annoyed by just about any problem you care to name - as evidenced by all the game utility sites that exist today - and then the devs can gain freedom of movement, since any bad change can be reverted by the players, and the players get to play with exactly the ui they want. of course, there are concerns with this process, but they are concerns that other games have faced. the game cannot be so moddable that people can use game tools to build macros to play the game for them. some interactions are too powerful and will need to be removed. the devs will have to keep on top of what is available and what is being used to ensure that the tools that they provide are not being used for undesirable purposes. however, i believe this to be an important change, perhaps even the single most useful change that could be made to the game right now. as such, i will work to establish a modifiable user interface for eve, and i will treat this as the single most important goal of my term of office."
"however, even if my goal of a user-moddable ui is implemented tomorrow, the game still needs to cater to new players, and as such the default user interface will still need work. there have been several players who have created lists of ui problems for the developers to fix, most notably xaen with his thread xaen's list of ui improvements, now over two years old. i encourage attempts to create a systematic process for collating and advancing complaints about the ui, and i will seek to involve the csm in this process in future. prior to every submission to ccp, i will create an open thread for desired ui changes. those changes that the council decides will likely be beneficial will be advanced to ccp. i know that the user interface is not as impressive an issue to deal with as changes to capital warfare or as likely to make headlines. it is, however, just as important to the long-term health of the game and to the good tempers of those playing it. while it will not be the only focus of my term of office, i think this is an area that has not been addressed adequately to date, and it is one where there is still a lot of real progress that needs to be made."
"policy  gameplaywhen it comes to fundamental gameplay, eve is an excellent game, and as far as i'm concerned it's easily the best mmo on the market today. however, as with all things human, it is still imperfect, and i see a few things about it that could be improved upon. the first category of flaw is aspects of the game that ought to be well-used, but due to failures of implementation are not. the two most obvious of these are low security(0.1-0.4) space and the charisma attribute. lowsec suffers from being at exactly the wrong place on the risk/reward curve. it is about as risky as 0.0, but with none of the profitability. as such, its primary uses are for people with specialized desires, such as factional warfare or small-scale piracy. there is nothing wrong with those uses, but they're not enough. a wide variety of things must be done to make lowsec more profitable on the whole, and if elected, i will propose a wide variety of ways of making lowsec more profitable including, but not limited to, more lowsec agents, better lowsec ores, better lowsec complexes, and boosts to level 5 missions. the other problem lowsec suffers from is that the security mechanism is an impediment to people attempting to take and hold space, since any group that shoots intruders will rapidly see their sec status decay too far to enter highsec. in order to rectify this, i will look into a mechanism that allows for a corporation controlling a lowsec system to defend their system without security loss. this would use a control system similar in philosophy to sovereignty in 0.0 and system control in factional warfare, though different in specifics. i believe that this would encourage players to colonize lowsec, by removing one of the major penalties from it, as well as providing a transition to the ultimate endgame of player-controlled 0.0 space."
"it is a maxim in roleplaying that charisma is the dump stat. if you want to play an effective, powerful character you should do as much as you can to avoid charisma, and instead put those attributes into things that help you more, which every other attribute generally does. unfortunately, eve falls into this trap just as badly as d&d ever did. i play an achura character, not because i think that the backstory is cool or the faces look good, but because everyone around me when i started told me i'd have to be insane to play anything else. and they were right. that's great for me, but it's bad for the game. the problem is that there simply aren't many charisma-using skills in the game. a trader can very naturally max charisma when he creates his character, and it will serve him very well until he has about 5 million sp, at which point he is out of things to train with charisma and those points drag him down for the rest of the game. this is bait-and-switch gameplay at its worst, and it needs to be rectified. as such, i will look for new charisma-using skills to add to the game, and will propose new ones whenever possible. i have some proposals for particular charisma skills which could be added, such as pos gunnery damage skills, ceo skills affecting wardecs(have more, make them cheaper, etc.), skills that would increase your choice in which mission to take, and many others, but i will refrain from making definite proposals until a great deal of brainstorming and consultation has been done to ensure that the skills proposed are right for the game and that we're not missing any good paths for expansion. as well, there are a few other issues of this sort that the past csm has already dealt with, most notably improvements to the bounty hunter system. while these issues are probably settled as far as the csm is concerned, i will ensure that these issues are dealt with properly if the previous submissions come across some unforeseen roadblock. we do not want the first council's good work going to waste.the second category of flaw is simple balance issues. as with any other game this complex, there's a lot of these. people have complained about everything from the nighthawk to the naglfar, from citadel torpedoes to defender missiles. most of these concerns are valid and are worthy of attention. however, they are not the csm's primary role. ccp has better data on ship usage and effectiveness than any player, and they are on the lookout for balance issues. as such, while i have no objection to bringing forward the players' opinions on balance issues, i consider most of them to be of secondary importance to more fundamental changes to the structure of the game. ccp wants the csm to be more about vision than trivia, and i agree with them. as such, i will attempt to focus on far-reaching solutions to balance issues, such as my thread proposing a revamp of defender missiles, rather than simple \"add 37 cpu to it\" fixes that ccp can come up with themselves. the goal for the csm is to bring forward new ideas for how to balance ships properly, not just to fiddle with numbers."
"the third category of gameplay issue that the csm can address is the creation of new content, or large amendments to old content, and this is the one where we as a group can probably do the most for the game. issues like balancing of doomsday devices, revamping of sovereignty, allowing alliances into factional warfare, fundamentally changing the nature of how rats drop loot, revamping the production cycle to include components, and dozens of others in this vein have been the primary job of the csm for the first term of office, and this will not change in future. there are far too many of these issues for me to express an opinion on each of them here, but if you want to know about any of them, just ask me. however, i will outline my approach to these issues generally. firstly, my primary goal is to do what is best for the game as a whole. i'm not running to benefit one group at the expense of others, and even if i was, ccp wouldn't implement any such proposals. there are always winners and losers in a change, but i will do my best to ensure that every change i propose would create more winners. secondly, i will ensure that every proposal i make is careful and well-considered. i like to muse about many things on the forums, but when it comes time to do this as a responsibility and not a hobby, i will take it seriously and ensure that my advice to ccp is as good as i can make it. ccp operates under limits on time, money, programmers, public relations and player sentiment, and they are hemmed in by the consequences of their past actions. if the csm does not respect these limitations and seek to work within them ourselves, we might as well be talking to a wall, because our suggestions will be useless to ccp. i will attempt to make proposals that respect the real limitations on ccp, and that work within those limitations to make a better game for everybody. and thirdly, i will consult with players on proposed changes. i read a large swath of the forums, and i like to think that i generally know what's going on with the game, but i don't know doomsdays as well as a titan pilot, and i don't know manufacturing as well as a long-time t2 builder. if i'm proposing major changes to the way that these people play the game, i intend to talk with them first. that includes any other csm reps with special knowledge of one aspect of the game, and it includes players at large. i will maintain an open-door policy when communicating with you, the player, and will take into consideration what the players tell me on issues. nobody gets a veto, but if you have something to say i'll listen. there is also one other way for the csm to aid ccp on gameplay issues, aside from direct recommendation of issues. currently, the assembly hall is the only way to conduct a fair poll of players with easy to interpret results, as evidenced by the pair of poll threads on the nano nerf. while such threads are not appropriate for all issues, and can choke out new ideas on the forum if too many are created, they are a valuable method of finding out the opinion of the players on especially contentious issues. therefore, i will create poll threads from time to time to determine the opinion of the players on especially controversial topics."
"about memy name is alex sloat, and i am a 22 year old living in brantford, ontario, canada who recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics. i am currently working as an office clerk for the local electrical company. i have been heavily involved with political bodies of many sorts, both partisan and not, since i was 16, and have a great deal of experience with positions on elected bodies.in eve, i play as herschel yamamoto, an achura pilot specializing in gallentean combat ships, and i've been playing for just under two years. i engage in a wide variety of activities - i regularly do missions, i harvest datacores, i am in the process of setting up a cruiser bpc store, i run a lottery, and i engage in pvp both as a mercenary and a pirate, as well as some other activities from time to time. i have at some point done virtually every activity outside of 0.0, and even then i try to learn as much about how things work there as i can so that i can comment on it intelligently. since the csm was announced, i have taken a strong interest in the body, and have been active in its processes. i've read all the meeting minutes, had conversations with many of the members, provided a great deal of support work to the current council - most notably, keeping the list of topics in the assembly hall up to date for serenity for two months, before it became obvious that serenity was not paying attention anymore - and have been probably the most active and dedicated person around the csm who was not a member or alternate.both in real life and in game, i am an active participant in what is going on in the world, and i have no objection to working hard in order to make sure that i don't let those around me down or shirk my responsibilities."

"the secondary goal of a new supply chain that doesn't convert readily back to minerals is to decouple the production stream from everything else made with minerals. you can make space bling and fun pvp ships, but not capitals and marketable goods. so, while the value is high, the production almost has to flow into consumption instead of deflating the value of all the empire labor and miners etc.i can kind of see what you're saying about the risk/reward of empire, but i can make more in a half-assed fit domi in 0.0 in a few hours than i can for several in empire. that's me, but it still says a lot. the barrier to 0.0 is very, very low if all you want to do is join a 0.0 alliance and side-step the whole grinding for standings thing. yeah, i have to watch local, but seriously...i've lost one ratting ship in all of eve and only by being completely stupid and jumping headlong into a nano-gang. i fit up another one in five minutes because it seriously didn't put even a minor dent in my income overall.one of the big challenges i think for making 0.0 work is the lack of economy. i'm considering starting up a side project with e-bank and a new crop of traders to try and go after that. it's quite possible to have a positive effect on the economic activity of a station by capitalizing a market and making the trips to empire less necessary. not to mention that i'm richi could see the value of additional market infrastructure for supporting neutral traders being a big plus for 0.0 overall. currently, i live in a covops/recon and survive on ramen noodles warmed up by overheating my mwd. i can use my skillz to do most of the flying. more places for good traders to settle down means more trade and that means less of a headache for the non-trade-savy....if space bling does one thing, making those nightmares etc be accessible in bulk would certainly take the cool out of ratting up a cnr...for more ratting. i think that would most certainly be a healthy thing for the game. why on earth it's a goal to get one ship when the game provides means of losing thousands is beyond me. if shyt was cheaper, we would see more losses. would we see more people finally getting that carrier and never logging in again? i just don't know...what point is the cake if you can't eat it? moar ships. moar pew-pew. more cake. more getting fat on enjoying the game instead of grinding around to get an uber l33t mission setup so you can get suicided by a bunch of t1 ravens in hisec and scream on forums how you're going to quit the game."
"reasonable enough. tell you what, eve-mail me your email, or make an account on shc and ill email/pm you a proposal for planetary interaction which would incorporate those aspects."
"you got my vote bro!"
"warning: this will be very boring! and take multiple sections to flesh out. but it is meant for those inclined to get an idea of what i am suggesting to have a look under the hood so to speak of what a system for planetary assets might be like if ccp choose to make it. in reality an average player wouldnt need to figure all these things out, or completely know how they are figured out. the most important thing would be knowing the relationship between the various indicators. all though for someone who really loves the inside mechanics and numbers, these would be great to know.i ask that you be patient as i write this, and post the various parts. thank you.part one: supply. i start with this not because it is more important than demand but because it ends up being the most complex part of the model in many aspects.to demonstrate this model we will be using wheat.an asset must produce a commodity that the corporation which sells it provides. so for wheat it would be the following six companies, further foodstuffs, kador family, prompt delivery, combined harvest, native freshfood, and food relief.for a character to buy an asset in this case, it would have to be in a system settled by one of these corporations. the lower the security rating of the system, the less expensive the asset could be, and also a lower tax rate. the character would also need at least a 6.0 standing with the corporation.so let us say the character was to buy his wheat asset from the kador family. so for this example the asset would be located on a planet within the kador prime region.next wed figure out the max sustainable supply that the kador family corporations player run assets are capable of delivering for that region, in this case kador. for this wed take the corporations supply/demand statistic for wheat which in this case is+ 0.00936046937222164now we would multiply that by 25 to get 0.234011734305541, and drop everything after the third decimal place for 0.234 in the end. lets call this the mass sustainable supply factor, so it has a spiffy technical name.(note: i actually choose 25 here for purposes of demonstration later to demonstrate effect of mssf. in reality, id recommend it being carefully determined on a per commodity and per region basis and closely tied to the demand. i chose 25 because it will interject some volatility into the model, and give a better idea of what the other indicators are actually reflecting.)now for the first time mssf is calculated we take the months highest volume for the commodity in a specific region where the asset is, which would be 47,412 in this case. but after the first week the system would be in place, id say it should be based on the average volume of the previous week rounding to the nearest whole number. then we would add the mssf to the volume and round up to get the mass growth factor. which would be 47,412 + 0.234% for a mgf of 47,522 here.so for the kador region we can say that the most which can reasonably be supplied per day this week would be a mgf of 47,522 units of wheat. now we can make some other mechanics with this number to determine some other factors.let us add something called the mgf range, and say it is +/- .25 percent base. meaning that on a given day the total wheat sold from the kador assets of wheat in kador prime to anywhere else in the cluster can in total be from 47,403 (rounded down.) to 47641 (rounded up.) with no worry of under producing or over producing to the sustainable supply. (note: more on the effect of that later when i get to asset specifics.)cont.."
"while we are at it, lets also have something called the supply growth momentum. this number, for the first week that the system is in place would be 0.0 for all regions on all commodities. but the way it is determined is this, take the mgf and compare it to the previous weeks volumes for a region. for this id recommend dividing the current mgf by 100, and then dividing each days average volume from the previous week by that result and dropping everything after the second decimal place, giving us the following list.sunday at 47,461 (99.87% of mgf.)monday at 47,557 (100.07% of mgf.)tuesday at 47,495 (99.94% of mgf.)wednesday at 47,613 (100.19% of mgf.)thursday at 47,424 (99.79% of mgf.)friday at 47,520 (99.99% of mgf.)saturday at 47,578 (100.11% of mgf.)(note: these are made up numbers. the real averages can vary wildly across a week with the current system. it is my belief that they will regular out if the asset system were put in place, or represent a point of volatility for a commodity under a corporation in a specific region.)now figure out the average for the week in percentage to mgf, rounding to the nearest second decimal, which would give us 99.99% average to mgf for this week. the sgm would be determined by difference between the average to mgf and one hundred percent. so the sgm on wheat in the kador region for this week would be -0.01 percent.the sgm would be an important number, it would show you the rate at which the corporations production for a commodity from a region can grow or shrink realistically without causing an upset to the regions assets to produce. this would then be applied to the current weeks mgf range, modifying it from the base +/- .25% to a range of - .26% / + .24% for the current week. but only the difference of the previous weeks sgm would be applied to each week after the first. so if the following weeks sgm was +0.02 then the mgf range would be modified by +0.01% to +/- .25% again (-0.01% + 0.02% = 0.01%) and this is done for a specific reason.say you bought a single stock share at 0.50 cents, and it fell to 0.25 cents. that is a fifty percent loss on the stock. but for that stock to raise back up now to its original value it has to increase by a full one hundred percent! the reason the sgm is figured like this is so it reflects the reality of momentum. if something is moving in one direction, it takes twice as much work to get it moving in the other at the same rate.an additional effect the sgm would have is to the mssf, being we add the two together for a new mssf for the current week.0.234% + -0.01% = mssf of 0.224% for the second week.so the mssf is only calculated based on the corporations supply/demand statistic of a commodity for the very first week the system is in place. but after that first week it is the previous weeks mssf and sgm that determine it for the current week.(note: however that original first weeks mssf is important as an indicator historically as it will let you know how well the specific corporations asset and commodity have done over any length of time, such as a business quarter, or even six years. seeing the mssf has gone from 0.234% to 0.198% in one quarter would let you know at a glance that there are real problems with the kador corporations wheat assets ability to supply in the kador region.)now given all the information above, we could see what things would be at the start of the second week after the system is put in place.first week ending / second week starting.mssf  0.234% / 0.224%mgf  47,522 / 47,628mgf range  (47,403 to 47,641) +.25% an -.25% / (47,504 to 47,743) +.24% an -.26%sgm  na / -0.01% (note: this sgm only effects this week. but the numbers generated from this week will determine it for next week.)"
"so what are these numbers showing about the kador wheat assets in the kador prime region?well the mssf drop is showing that kador since the system was started is headed into a slowdown of its wheat production growth. this is artificial though do to using 25 earlier when generating the starting mssf. but as we look at the mgf increase along with the mssf, we are inclined to think the growth of kador prime wheat production is out of sync with the growth of demand in the market. and that local asset owners need to curb their development to be much slower to get back on track. the mgf range seems to confirm this, as it appears that wheat assets production can afford to deliver less and not be concerned with a state of under production. lastly the sgm means they just did not sell has much wheat on average as they did last week, and that market volume dropped.so why this supply model to get only that?the main point of this model is to break up factors. to not make it so easy to produce and sell the correct amount from week to week. also it limits what a region can realistically sell in a week or how much it can increase its production and not upset the market, no matter how many assets may be producing and selling to market.another point to consider is the model ignores a concept of true price, and correct supply to match demand. i hope this becomes much clearer after i illustrate the supply side in the second part, and the actual asset specifics in the third. but to clarify, supply and demand should never meet exactly. this model is meant to make that relationship fuzzy, and generally stay within a range of each other. but it is also meant to allow bubbles, crashes, and booms to form and take place."
"you may want to put this in your assembly hall thread, not in the speakers forum.also, i don't think that eve needs a virtual market, if we need passive production methods we can create passive real asset production which we can then produce assets that are valuable to the greater eve population. while planetary interaction is a good thing to develop, this is not the direction it should be going.a better direction would be the production of and automatic logistics of pos fuels and moon mineral allocation."
"thanks for correcting me on that, i thought here was also a place to post on topics for the csm, not just about the csm."
"the jita speakers forum is also supposed to be an \"idea exchange\". the assembly hall is only for finished ideas for raising to ccp."
"this thread is about the specifics of a proposal already in the assembly hall."
"we have, we did. we were also adults about it and *listened* to their responses (aside: note how many proposals which have already been answered - some in the affirmative - get reposted as new requests to the csm as people can't be bothered to check first) and even then we questioned them when they said it couldn't be done. and when they said it will be done (and we got plenty of those too) we asked when, and how soon, and told them which we believe *the players* would like to get in first.you don't have an idea for something new or improved in eve and release it a week later, or a month later, and maybe it might be a full year later. but we've been promised that many of the suggestions we took from you, the players, are being added to the development pipeline and, one day, they will appear. i already note in the coming expansion some things we on the csm have discussed with ccp and the devs. the csm may not have been what was originally hoped for but it does have a record of success already and has changed the way ccp have viewed some of the eve-online universe so, instead of attacking us, work to make the csm even more successful instead.iz"
"gotta say i kinda like the idea.(having fueled that way in elite long long long ago)yeah it would have to be almost suicidal from a risk perspective. it would also have to be incredibly time intensive.with those two huge disadvantages, it would be best to mine ice, and only do a harvest in the worst of all worst case scenarios."
"personally, if you killed hundreds of my men, no amount of talking and money would get you into good graces with me.however, this is a game and should be fun and flexible."
"glad i did not do that power of two!"
"gtc price hike + rl economic woes + no ghost training fallback = consolidate accounts."
"patience and persistence.removing ghost training was probably the worst move in eve history.increasing monthly cost i can understand even tho it sucked but this? unforgivable unless revoked.tiv"
"i agree ghost training brings player's back to the game its like a cookie jar u get bored of the cookies in there u leave them for abit and you find some new ones put in so you return but if you take the new ones away you think meh i see why i left these alone and if they still bring this through at least do the idea for training multiple accounts at once we pay for the three account slots we want to use them and train 3 at once its the same as ghost training but opposite we actually pay for them"
"come the revolution whoever removed ghost training is 1st up against the wall, ok maybe 3nd after simon cowell and michael portillo."
"i support this"
"i dont use ghost training.but i support the long time players with this option that is here for 5 years.eve is a great game. dont change to much!!!"
"u turn needed on this change - bad idea ccp!!"
"this is a betrayal to all eve community. i can't believe that ccp would pull the rug under so many peoples' feet in a time like this."
"give back the feature you cut out of the game after over half a decade."
"i and all my alts say that this change is good"
"1. it was handled by ccp for 5 years as established feature.2. it certainly influenced design decisions profoundly (required skill portfolios for new ships or equipment, training difficulty for new skills, a.s.o.)3. it was a primary reasons that some of the insane required real life training times on some skills were tolerated.4. it basically increases the cost to build up alts and by that experience alternate gamestyles by up to 50%. 5. the in conjunction with the lost flexiblity by the removal of 30 days and increased cost by that of 90 days gtcs, the upkeeping of secondary accounts became exponentially more diffcult if not prohibitive for many players.6. it removes a major motivation for returning to the game after a break.7. it cements the allready huge gaps between established and new players. 8. ..."
"bring back \"ghost training\"!!!!"
"10 days to quit, probably for good this time."
"been a couple of good years, but this time i quit for good i think."
"return ghost training"
"a 5 year bug.. give me a break. terrible decision, and dressed up so, so badly."
"i am throwing in my vote as well, i think a skill queue of 5-6 skills would be excellent, it would benefit all players and especially people who have limited logon time or the possibility of not being able to logon at all. we are all paying a monthly fee or buying time cards so i think we should be able to set a queue to advance our skills in case we are unable to logon for skill changes...ya know the whole rl thing comes up at time :-)"
"yes.. fully supported"
"i forgot to add:many people play eve because they want to be involved in a mmorpg but dont have the time to grind levels to progress.long skills are great for these poeple but they really miss out on the short skills, you must consider that even vets when they tyrain a new branch of skills have a bunch of lvl 1-4 to do, and a skill que would really boost these players (and attract more)"
"/signedimplement with certificates please"
"yes. even if it's just for 2 skills, it would be a great boon for people who have lives."
"although this feature would make especially sense for new characters,that function should have been introduced ages ago, so, yes."
"there is no excuse now, ccp login to change skills is not playing."
"/signed!"
"it only makes sense to do this.ccp say that for quantum rise they have included many things that the player base has been asking for. chances are this isn't in it, but what the hey."
"something is needed to be given back to those who didn't abuse ghost training and lived on 30d gtcs."
"support"
"supported"
"bump for an important topic"
"having smarbombs being able to reduce incoming damage is still somewhat important, but having them able to completely neutralise all incoming damage from missiles with just a 1-2 smartbombs is a little over the top."
"now before everyone cites me for a hypocrite, i have used this forum in the past and still continue to watch/post in this forum.my problem is anyone can post in a forum that is actively watched by the csm(hopefully), while in reality all it is, is another faucet/forum for people to post their suggestions, ideas, whines, bugs, nerf this, or boost this posts. these forums are already in place with game development, features & ideas, and the eve general discussion. the csm should already be looking at the features and ideas forum, as well as game development. the assembly hall is where the pod pilots can show their support for the issues the csm bring forward. then after seeing the support, or lack there of, can decide to take it to a vote or not during the csm meetingi propose that the ability to make new posts in this forum be reserved only for ccp and the csm. now once a post is made, anyone can reply to the thread in support for or against the idea (thumbs down proposal -"
"supporting my idea to only allow the csm to post threads here (ccp excluded), and all others can only reply... while giving their thumbs up, or hopefully at somepoint thumbs down on the issues"
"best post so far this month"
"agreed. also it is just doesn't make any sense to present an idea here. soon it gets confusing as to what exactly is being supported, as many support post state they only support an issue if it conforms to some addition of their own. that makes it entirely to hard i would imagine for the csm to determine what the issue / solution they will be debating and approaching ccp about even is."
"now the problem can arise that your csm, can start bring forth pet projects that really wasnt something the main playerbase was asking for. same thing happens with real life elected officials.as a balance hopefully the csm would site links to the other forums when they start a topic so the pyramids of discussion are still hashed in the main forum, while leaving this forum mainly for a \"support\", \"dont support\", \"ill support if, then, else\" type environment.but i didnt want to put that as a mandatory requirement in my request. but i do feel it should still be encouraged if my proposal is widely accepted and finally adopted by ccp"
"if we used that system we'd barely have any topics at all and mostly dumb ones that only self-serve the csm members.instead, this forum should be moderated. there are too many whine threads, ideas and spam threads in the ah that never get moved. ah has become a dumping ground for terrible ideas and random insignificant *****ing threads, leaving gd terribly empty."
"i can't support this proposal - it'd stifle the democracy that the csm is supposed to be promoting.however, i do agree with what i think is your main complaint - the forums utterly lack definition, and as such they all just form an undifferentiated mess. i've always thought of the assembly hall as the place for finalized proposals, submitted in a form where they're immediately usable by the csm, and the other forums as place for idea development. jita park should be used for topics about the csm only - candidate threads, meeting minutes, and idea development for ideas about the csm - things like \"how can the csm better communicate with players?\" and \"what should we use as rules of order?\". i'd be entirely in favour of putting a sticky at the top of the assembly hall, to identify exactly what the csm expects to see out of threads here, to attempt to clean up this mess. players should be encouraged to participate directly, but they should also be encouraged to keep everything in the right forum."
"i had a tl:dr post like verone with a lot of the same stuff but i deleted it because it was so long and boring.-xl smartbomb is a terrible idea-new scripts are cool but tradeoffs must be made-no solopwnmobile for youpersonally i'd rather have a brand new \"utility module\" than just a slightly changed one."
"this."
"against.i fly minmatare ships more then half year mostly bs, if minmatare wouldnt have speed they die very quick even in pve...they now have useless arty, and only ac and speed may equivalent it with other race. pitty why i canceled train my caldari character, then ccp boost missiles and they will be uber. nerf web and all guns will be space trash.look at minmatares, all of them train ammarian ships. do you know anyone from other race who want train minmatare ships? or projectile arty?i like eve but ccp dont do it worst for people who want still stay with you."
"totally against this movei say nerf the blob instead."
"i say nerf them both. nano***s and blobbers ruined this game."
"i agree to the fire and forget for stealth bomber bombs, and tbh it should be the same for missiles, just imo"
"i would also like to throw my support into this thread, bombs should be fired and the pilot able to recloak in 2-3 seconds provided he isnt locked and try to escape. i have been messing around with the sb's for a short while and i cant really find any use for them as of yet, they cant use the cov ops cloak, the cruise missiles are a joke and the bombs cost to much for what you get from them.i think the pilot should be able to cloak after launching and just give the bomb a dmg penalty based off of bomb launcher skill lvl, cloaking skill lvl, and cov ops skill lvl. the higher those skills the less of a dmg penalty you are hit with after cloaking. maybe i am slightly crazy, but i enjoy the thought of all the michief i could get into with a proper working sb"
"well there are lots of things that i use my stealth bomber for with cruise's.but yes i would like to see the bombs given the fire and forget mode with a range option.it would also be interesting to make a lazer guided bomb where you can have it lock onto a large ship or structure that is being target painted."
"two weeks ago i set all of my client background and window theme colors to cheery hues of blue. i've started catching myself thinking, \"eve is a very cheery game. in fact, it's getting more cheerful every day.\" however, the opening scenes of the client are still dull gray. in fact, there are a lot of things about eve that could be modified to adapt better to players' styles.proposal specificsopening theme responds to client changes before logging in. alternate color schemes configurable for the launcher.the planet centered at the login screen is a blue earthy looking planet fit for a barbecue and probably packed with pleasant korean women who enjoy sunbathing, karaoke, and shochu. twinkling stars on a glistening frosty ribbon of winter.the alternate color scheme can remain a low-key option to preserve the theme the devs are going for, but a radio button is added to the character creation system somewhere before the portrait creation that says \"i am not a manic depressive.\" the other button will be pressed by default, but will not have a description listed necessarily.the character creation system will have an alternate pallet of non-freakish matar and non-gothy amarr options, but will be referenced to the regular counterparts for those to busy playing the game in the fast lane of the \"down the highway, not across the road\" mode. if you're on \"cheery\" you see the new options, and otherwise you see the counterparts from the existing abnormal system.the gallante will have baseball caps, cigarettes, puma logo gear, and will be able to psychically detect when someone is about to play anything rakim and proceed to hit every beat and add good vibrations to the universe.less relevant, but an alternate forums color scheme that automatically turns all orange tags to blue. no grey on every other post as black looks cleaner and less depressing.thank you for your time.tl;drproposing minor alternate options to play in a parallel universe with a proxy artistic scheme to cover up the dizasta caused by the closing of the eve gate and subsequent loss of all contact with humanity."
"lol..."
"vote."
"i fully support this thread now. i now realize that if:1) datacores canceled. 2) sell orders canceled. 3) rp collection canceled. will make me allot of isk in game. sorry for disagreeing with you shar, it was a principal thing before. now that we can no longer finish training while inactive, i think we should really go for the gold. and, this is actually a thought out change of mind here, not being facetious at all."
"you do have to wonder tho, how many inactive accounts are there just accumulating datacores?i hadnt really even thought about it until i read this thread, but farming isk on an inactive accout seems like a way to progress in the game without paying to me and is blatently unfair to the honest playeri really cant see how ccp could justify letting this continue considering the comments made in the dev blog abotu why they stopped ghost traininglets hope ccp are true to their word and stamp this kind of exploitation of an \"unintended feature\" out asap"
"if it can be done to only trigger the timer while under aggression from a player not an npc. getting a ctd in the middle of a mission or something would suck ass with a 5 minute log off timer."
"i've had client crashes in the past month and days with never ending disconnects so nope."
"the log off timer when aggroed by a player before ctrl-q is 15 minutes. so exactly what you want?- 2-3 minutes after decloacking? - 2-3 minutes after the first shot against someone that has already logged off?- 2-3 minutes before emergency warp?- or what?"
"just fix it already, dont care how."
"game and server can differentiate whether crtl-q was pressed or game was killed from task manger or real network problem occured.do not increase log-off timer(may be even reduce it) just put proper code to address this issue."
"yes, but can it differentiate between a real network problem and you pulling out your network cable?venkul mul has this one exactly right."
"i vote for the nerf."
"guess its nanonerf ftw"
"support this!"
"i approve of this proposal."
"one of the things that really set eve apart from the rest."
"prolly been discussed before, but i have an idea. ccp needs to come up with some way for players to challenge these bot miners. right click a miner and issue a challenge...say a simple mathematical challenge out of a selection of five. no response within a minute and bingo...the miner turns red. i know it's simplistic but hey, something needs to be done about the isk miners. afk miners could stop mining for a few..dunno much about mining though.suggestions? thoughts? flames"
"hello capt,interesting idea, but i don't think it's really feasable. i had a different idea posted on my website on how to get rid of both the bots and afk miners."
"hiya bunny....along the same lines as yours but players do the raiding. give missioners some fun and a change of pace. try to leave the devs out, just an announcement that triggers some kind of flag where they are fair game after 5 min....red to everybody for say 15 min."
"no. i don't see it bringing anything good to eve."
"because it would ruin specialization in eve. why bother getting a friend/corpmate with specialized skills to do something when you can have an alt to do anything you want?agreed with one amendmentallow 3 characters to be trained on a single account at 1/3 speedallow 1 character to be trained at normal speed.training does not need to be sped up."
"i am inclined not to support this idea, due to the whole character-farming thing. but, if they would then implement something like kahega mentioned, then maybe.i created a second character, but then sent her to the biomass queue, as the training time would have interfered with this one's training. and, as he wants to be a fully-fledged mining director flying hulks, i couldn't let anything interfere with that! ab"
"this should be implemented with some kind of training speed penalty when training multiple chars in same acc"
"brilliant"
"all mmos operate on a time=money=power system. the longer you keep your account, the more you've paid for it, and the more powerful it becomes.other mmos require that you actually play your character to power it up (xp grind). so, it isn't possible to \"train\" multiple characters simultaneously in those games either, unless they are on seperate accounts.ccp would be taking money out of their own pocket by allowing this, unless they allowed you to train all three, but have them train at 1/3 the rate at which they train today. changing it to be 3x the current rate would be a slap in the face to those who have paid 5 years of sub fees to skill their character up to where it is now.what you could do is have a tiered system of accounts, like:train 1 character: 14.95 a monthtrain 2 characters: 27.00 a monthtrain 3 characters: 40.00 a monthit basically gives you a discount over what having 3 accounts would cost, which makes sense, becuase if you had 3 accounts you could play them at the same time.sorry guys, but game time is what ccp has to sell, and becoming more powerful over time is one of the primary ways that they keep you interested in buying it. you aren't going to get them to massively devalue their own product."
"x"
"character farming is 'playing the game' then selling your character? so everybody is a potential char farmer, and everybody who sold a char is a char farmer? my solution is simple: to stop char farming, stop char trade. hell, if i could train 2 chars, i wouldn't need to buy one.interesting, i thought farming included paying to train a char up(that's what you tell me anyway), so if it's free it shouldn't be farming.seriously, eve has more than 3 specialties. you mention only 4 and imply there are more by using 'etc.' but i still have only 3 slots.eve may be an mmo, but ccp does not want to obligate everyone to multiplay, nor does it obligate everyone to roleplay. mmo means you can interact, not that you are obligated to.does nobody care that char farming is possible as long as you pay ccp for it? basicly people are kind of saying: \"char farming/alts should not be available to poor people who only pay 15 euro's/month\" ccp democracy(tm)kind of thing.but maybe i missed the point of these extra char slots. perhaps they are for storing old chars you get tired off, not building new ones."
"from beta to release, ccp removed skilling on 3 characters to 1 in order to draw out the advancement process over a long period of time in order to milk players of subscriptions over a long period of time, and also to force serious players into paying more than one subscription in order to reach the same baseline service enjoyed in other games. players think that skill advancement while offline is somehow a feature made for their convenience. its not. same as the above, this was done to make advancement take a long time so youd pay ccp more money. if skilling happens by a clock, not by your effort, then it doesnt matter if three players take 8 hours shifts to play a character 24 hours a day, that character is still going to take forever to skill up, same as the account manned by a casual player who only logs 10 minutes a month to change skills. what if people didnt pay for multiple accounts and spend years skilling up in order to reach some kind of plateau in personal advancement? well, then ccp might actually have to make some content for their game, rather than just a sandbox, and thats never going to happen. ccp likes stringing you out for years on multiple subscriptions while giving you free expansions that are only 39mb big, and a game thats only 3 gigs on the hard drive after over half a decade. thats just too little work for too much money for them to change anything."
"we have had a few internal discussions about this recent removal of ghost training, and while we did not agree on everything, one of the things that came out was the anger over ccps communication with this issue.no-one is going to buy that this was just a bug (really, a bug not fixed for over 5 years, ha), and the other reasons they gave were quickly interpreted by players as \"we want more money!\".the csm has already brought up this problem after the change in the gametime codes, that the players are angered that ccp said they are just \"conforming to industry standards\", which was an outright lie, and more of those things.however, ccp did not seem to take this particular concern very serious and iirc this point was even omitted from the final conclusion on that discussion.now they made the same mistake. my question to you is, what do you think of the current communication, and how would you like to see it. please try to be constructive and keep in mind that i plan to bring this issue before ccp again, thanks."
"let me just play devils advocate here, because i don't think this post was all that well writen. it lacks perspective.it's more like an unintended feature.no. world of warcraft has set the industry standard. they only offer 60 day cards. thus, it can't be a lie.people were angered about the nano nerf. people were angered about the t20 incident. people were angered about the carrier nerf. as i pointed out shortly after the first csm had taken seat in office, ccp's communicate sux epicly. they aren't communicating and their moderation team keeps screwing up(just look at how they locked our ghost-training voting thread!).we can't make ccp communicate. however, everybody should tell ccp what they feel at fanfest, to be frankly honest. csm shouldn't be the only mean of telling this to ccp. talking to ccp employees face to face is much more effective.however, i'm very much afraid of how you are going to raise an \"issue\" about this. how are you going to make ccp improve itself if you don't know the actual background for all they have done thus far. how is it not just going to be \"i think you should improve communication because i think it sux at the moment\".</devilsadvocate>"
"no. there are a lot of sore losers out there that are nitpicking a small line in the player guide and are making a big deal out of nothing.ccp rushed a dev blog and replied more than enough in the mega-thread.we could use a way to see ccp responses in mega threads, since no one wants to sift through 20+ pages of whiners to get to it.if you think a company has to explain itself and announce in big bold letters \"we are trying to make money here\", then you are out of your mind. i have news for you: all for profit companies are in it to make money. to think otherwise is foolish and childish.it is a clear and demonstrated fact that ccp communicated with the players and fully explained themselves, if you think ccp are lying or misleading the people then by all means get some proof or stfu."
"how bout spending some of the cash they're making on training their customer service techniques to their employees ... and conforming to those industry standards.maybe run a small pr campaign too ... their image needs to be polished up a bit."
"the communication in that instance was an utter disaster.managing to squeeze three lies into the space of two paragraphs and somehow give the whole thing this insulting, argumentative... even defensive tone was quite the achievement.it was like they were trying to **** me off. people who want my money normally have the good sense not to do that.bearing in mind that i'm not stupid, that eve is a frippery and that there's plenty of other things to spend that money on i think they should give more thought to how they do those things in the future.the customer isn't always right, but the customer is always the customer.yes, even in mmo land. i don't care how much ass burgers you got."
"well personally i think the csm is a lie and ccp just gave us the illusion that we had the power to make things change but in the end they do what they want, when they want and how they want.after ccp lied about the ghost training removal i am now convinced that the players will be more and more disappointed , because you cant massively go after money and then think for one second that your customers will be happy with whatever choice you force down their throat .don't misunderstand me , i am not protesting against the ghost training removal ; i only used it twice without abusing it i thought this was a very cool feature.but in the end like always ccp tend to punish everyone for a small problem , its always the case ."
"your post merely re-affirms my belief that not only will ccp not apologise for what they did wrong, they don't even think they've done anything wrong.as such, attempting a dialogue with them is pointless, because they don't even understand why we're angry. they're utterly out of touch. and even if they weren't, they're obviously desperate for money. (wtb: $30m investment that disappeared like morning frost)and really, dear anhk, the fact that you're even making this post smacks of desperation. disillusionment shines through your every sentence. oh dear, all those noble dreams and sweet promises in your election video..."
"well then why don't you stop overloading the database about it."
"well for me this issue atm does not effect me personnally but i can feel for those it does affect,i have been in game close to 4 1/2 years and my anger is more directed at the total lack of thought that went into this change, hardly no warning, apparent non caring attitude towards the playerbase & treating the playerbase with dis-respect with lies as to the reasons behind the change.ive seen and put up with a lot in this game and although i love the game and community to bits and really beginning to hate the currant emphasis by ccp staff that they dont care,ive had about 4 petitions in my time for ship loss due to lag, bugs etc always get the same response of 'our logs dont show anything' typical copy/paste reply,every single member of the gm's ive talked to dont even show any sympathy etc coupled with the lack of playerbase interaction im firmly of the opinion ccp just wants money and doesnt care whatsoever if people leave, this last incident for me is just another example of the heavy handed draconian way ccp treats its customers.ive stopped the eon subscription long ago over a incident with the eve shop and never bought anything from there sincethis year will be my last visit to fanfest in iceland where i will be voicing my opinions.i would stop my spare accounts if i didnt enjoy the company of my friends ingame as much as i do, all eve is for me now is a expensive chat engine lolccp has no clue whatsoever how to talk to its playbase or deal with complaints and issues in that respect ccp fail miserably."
"what some people dont understand is a consumers role in this.you are the consumer, you have the power to say \"hey i don't like this product any more, i'm going elsewhere.\"and the company goes \"ohh guys we stuffed up holy hell\" and hopefully reverse the change.the thing i never got was the \"we are conforming to industry standards\" ... in an industry that spends so much time to make its product much like ccp did with eve totally unique, and different because said industry is built on it. well it is just wrong, it makes no sense to say \"hey were conforming\" because this week its this, next week its ambulation, and the week after that is a facinating new few race's of orcs and elves, and more oh my.give ccp hell guys, after nerfing this game so hard, then hurting the playerbase both with timecards and then this just gives more reasons why they need to start listening for once.realise this, if this was a balance change, because people who had little money could still play the game with those that have alot of money and can train whilst away from the game for a while, isn't balance. it's not balance that us older players have had 5 years of on and off playing and on 24/7 training isn't fair balance either.this and the timecard changes are a severe money grab, and tells me the consumer that something is wrong, either a new suit who is a money hungry guy, or the company is leaking money and failure is near.every time a mmo has gone the \"we need more money/were confomring to industry standards\" route it has fallen apart soon after.i'm getting out before it tanks, come join me over at any of the different products, with better companies."
"i underlined the key words."
"as a gtc reseller i agree with the op. gtc prices have spiraled out of control and if prices keep rising then no one will be able to afford them. when i do have gtc's i usually sell them at 475 mil which causes my screen to fill with convo requests as soon as i say i have them.the removal of the 30 day and 90 day cards was a big mistake for ccp. i can understand they wanted to streamline their marketing database but they should have upgraded their database instead of reducing the calculations it had to make. in addition, the price for the 60 day cards is way out of line. if they are an alternative to paying with credit / debit card then they need to match the price that the game costs. $14.95 x 2 = $29.90 if they lowered the price by just a few dollars then i think this would solve the problem with the lower supply."
"it really doesn't have a lot to do with the removal of the cards, guys, though, since the ghost training nerf you may see a return of the 30 day cards, since it's likely that their removal was a first attempt at doing the same thing.it's just good old supply and demand. you have less people willing to part with extra money over and above what their subscription costs. they're less certain about their jobs and their finances. short of fixing the economy, there isn't much that ccp can do about it.the ghost training nerf might help some. it will probably incent people to drop some of the extra accounts they've been carrying, and the demand may go down."
"unless it actualy brings the prices up :p lets face it, inactive accounts that can train , dont need gtc's , therefore less demand,so theres a chance that \"no ghost skilling\" may bring more demand. if this becomes true , then theres a chance we will see prices reach the billion isk sometime soon. but fear not , if it does , quite a few people will leave the game and demand will drop. i am seeing people struggle in keeping up with the isk required to keep their main account active..and yes..with world financial crisis, we all have less to spend on non-essentials like eve (blasphemy..i know !!)well one things for sure , we will see more super caps ingame, if your getting a billion isk per gtc.mayb its worth ccp considering capping the sale price sometime soon, or we may just see a universal financial crisis in eve to match the current world finacial crisis."
"i find the ghost training change to be perfectly acceptable, but agree that it was managed poorly by ccp. they were justified in making the change, but it would have been a far better to give a reasonable amount of warning so that those who had been playing by long-held ccp policies were given a chance to adapt. and if it's true they suppressed reasonable debate on the matter, they were wrong to do so.not sure what gtc prices have to do with anything, since gtc prices are player-driven."
"sure. let the csms run with it.might drive home to more people exactly how ccp don't really care and the csm is just a pr tool."
"since i'm a honest decent paying customer i say to hell with the ghost training"
"i suppose that's a good principle for the balance teams to keep in mind, although they already do to some extent, but i have no idea where you're going with it."
"i agree to a certain extent, their are ships who's role is now designed role is now obsolete except in unusual situations or for new players that could do with some tweaking or rp wise \"major cluster wide upgrade payed for by____\" to make them more common. of course since i'm an industrialist i'm biased towards giving my self a bigger market :)."
"ccp made \"waiting for skill completion while away from eve\" impossible? for their reasons... they will not reverse this, i think no.how can we speed up learning these x12 skills, to learn them in _reasonable_time_ and throw away at least, a bit of \"playing in standby mode\"??? 6+, 7+ implants or maybe + more? just to be fair? it will take amount of playtime (and play activities) to get those items but in the same time will make \"long skills\" a _bit_ faster to get (we talk about 5 lvl`s). what do you think?"
"i havent used ghosttraining so far since im a new player, but looking at my skillplan to fly something bigger then a battleship i understand why it got abused/used to its maximum.imho something needs to be done to keep players playing and paying while training timesinks like adv. spaceship command to lvl 5 tbh i dont know if another isk-sink like +7 implants would be good solution cause even the +5 implants are very expensive imho (at least for me )"
"i have no idea why training can't be accelerated by use of a skill.for instance, interceptors i, yeah generally you want at least 3 if not 4 levels on a skill, but why can't you get accelerated learning through actually flying an interceptor whilst it trains?some skills would need a slightly different calculation, for instance shield management and other support skills (shield, cap, armour skills) but could still have their training reduced in certain scenarios. the game itself can be really good at times, the training does have it's benefits at times, but is also a bit stale and dull."
"it's not like ghost training made anything faster, it just made it cheaper in terms of rl dollars. nothing needs to be sped up as a result of its removal, and that includes the proposal for better implants. asc 5 is a timesink, yes, but it's a timesink whether you are paying for your account or not. you might as well get some money while you're at it."
"+7 baby!!! better yet, lets have a +10 implant set!"

"now which of all of those had a broad and long backing in the features and ideas discussion forum and which were merely pet projects of the championing delegate or slapped on there due to some assembly hall trend?did you at all comb the former forum for material or just count thumbs in this place?"

"the pilots name was cyvok, with ascn, and the avatars name was \"steve\", and was wiped out by bob in c9n-cc, where ccp put a monument..for those who were wondering.most of my ships are called \"below the belt\" and i just attach a 1 / 2 / 3 etc on them on how many i've lost of the ship type.i like this idea on super-capitals, but what if you come to sell it? wouldn't it limit the buyers if they don't like the fact you've called your aeon \"super pink and fluffy ice cream maker\"?"
"if it is as simple as changing the skin then i can live with that. however, i agree with several other people that they need to rework the entire mission system although that is not the purpose of this thread."
"more bc more bs"
"i think most people think that ccp won't listen, or the csm won't have any effect.but then again most people don't think about the long-term effects. we've had almost a hundred issues so far, and only half a dozen were actually implemented in the game or known to be in the short-term release pipeline.and of those issues a lot of people think \"meh, ccp already had that planned, what do we need the csm for?\"i agree that things could have been better, especially the communication. both between us and ccp and between us and the players. however this is a long-term process and this is just the beginning."
"well, it's basic psychology: humans don't move unless there is a subjacent motivation which provides subjective benefits vs the overhead required by the task.some csm candidates act under the conviction that the whole community can benefit from their interventions, other ones are there merely to push an hidden agenda. nothing new, it's also like that in rl politics since humanity exists.i can only have compassion for players being manipulated that way by ccp. my beef is that the job could have been performed efficiently and silently, without integrating aspects like representatives, egos, hidden interests and subjectivity ,which invariably mess things up unless all candidates are living examples of wisdom. and with all due respect, eve is certainly one of the last places i would look for wisdom"
"the issue at hand here is not if the csm is effective since it's effectiveness is solely function of ccp's obscure decision processes based on we don't know what set of criterias on a case-by-case basis, and therefore totally out of control.rather the question is, why did ccp come up which such an intricate concept, both in design as implementation, when things could have been done simply while providing a much higher degree of objectivity by avoiding the pitfalls implied by any kind of representative system ?it's all the difference between form vs substance."
"i think there's several reasons to it:1. it's a social experiment. ccp xhagen, who created the csm, studies philosophy. it might be a product of his mind to see how it would turn out?2. a better community trough \"standards\" by the elected representatives. the current state of the eve-o forum is extremely sad. one could imagine ccp had hoped that the csm would set the standard. you could argue it did for this term. the csm document is actually fairly explicit about this 3. better communication with the community. you could argue that the csm allows for more communication with ccp by providing a 2-way communication with csm as the moderator. however, it *has* had the effect that ccp seemingly communicates less with us on certain key issues. however, they should certainly not hear from anyone that they don't let us in on what they are working on. the recent spew of dev blogs and the like was certainly to be expected, despite the amount of whine which thought ccp was ignoring the community. however, their communication on things like the alliance tournament is *really* bad.that's what i can come up with for now."
"philosophy is a very interesting field, but except for juggling with abstract concepts, absolutely useless in eve's framework unless you cross-reference it with real & documented data. here, structural anthropology comes much more handy since it provides (philosophical) analysis of models which have been implemented here or there at some time in human history. check claude l<U+FFFD>vi strauss for example. i wouldn't state is as \"sad\". like it or not it's just the mere reflection of a reality. artificially hiding it will not induce any behavioral evolution. genuine changes are often the result of providing constant and long-term behavioral examples instead of working through brute force.when a money-making venture is led by a directorate which isn't submitted to an accountability framework on fact finding missions, analysts, decision processes and subsequent implementations, the resulting behavior can sometimes be erratic. as long ccp isn't a traded company led by a board of directors whose position can be put in jeopardy at each shareholders meeting according to their performance, don't expect too much alliance tournaments ? i stopped to bother from 2006 on, the day ccp's referee wasn't even able to follow their own set of rules by popping my ship (which left a can at 80 km from said referee who was located at the center of the battlefield) under the pretext that i had crossed the 100 km radius of the arena"
"this is just my best guesses for factors that make many people continually stay within high sec. and i'd like to hear how as a csm rep you would advise ccp in dealing with them if they did appear to be true. 1. you get too many people in too small a place that was originally designed to meet the needs of starting characters.2. people in a virtual world exhibit anti-social levels of greed, or intolerance for loss. the real life legal consequences for greed do not exist, and the social consequences of the behavior are not strong enough to deter it. 3. survivability is fairly easy as an individual in high sec, compared to the harder work and social skills needed to thrive as a group in low sec, so social ties and need to develop team work skill can remain quite weak in a large amount of the player base.the above three conditions lead to opportunistic economics, much like inequality leads to street crime. and it progresses to a worsening and constant cycle from there which comes to a head with the below.too much unrewarding work for two a low risk that leads to unrealistic perceptions of the moderate risks the game designers envisioned. put simply, for many players to lose the ship they spent two or more weeks grinding missions, mining, trading/hauling, in thirty seconds isnt worth it no matter how unlikely that is. the ship is given unrealistic value by the investment of spare time playing the game to acquire it. even though they can most likely make the amount to cover that ships loss in low sec much faster, a fear of being unlucky and being back to dull game play for two weeks oddly enough keeps them pursuing low risk low reward game play. and worse off this effect stacks. so one ends up working longer dull game play activities to get that ship they think they can make it in low sec with. but when they finally do have the skill and isk for it, that ship also gets an unrealistic sense of value given the time taken to work for it.this causes player progression to low sec and 0.0 to slow down, and creates a bottle neck effect. parts where the designers envisioned a two month player working to progress are over run with six month characters consuming everything. it starts a slowing of the ability of newer characters to progress, and allows time for the unrealistic senses of risk that many develop toward 0.0 to sink in.and best luck on the election."
"watching the first csm session with great interest the most glaring problem to me was the lack of representation for the 0.0 side of eve. i consider the 0.0 'endgame' and warfare in it to be driving force that pushes eve forward. empire space serves some essential services to this endgame, but it's primary role should be to get players adjusted to eve before they head out to 0.0 and enjoy the greatest player versus player combat available anywhere, in any game.if elected i will represent not only existing 0.0 players but more importantly those who aspire to play in 0.0 but find the barriers to entry too high, or would like to play in 0.0 if only it wasn't plagued by lag, blobs, powerblocks, doomsdays, mind-numbing starbase warfare mechanics, and insensitive gms who can't find their logs.specifically i identify three main problem areas:"
"1. customer supportpetitions are still too slow. it often takes 3-4 replies before you get a 'real' answer from a human being. when you're seeking reimbursement the logs are usually claimed to show nothing at first but if you persist and escalate a senior gm often finds the evidence. players feel like they're being deceived and their time is being wasted. many petitions become closed because the player gives up, not because their problem has been fully investigated, and some of those players eventually leave eve.important bugs which cause regular loss of in-game assets do not get the attention they deserve. (it will soon be four years since the exodus ui overhaul and the overview background color bug introduced then still exists and still causes newer players to shoot the wrong targets. for the last 12 months more capital ships seem to be lost due to desyncs than real combat, yet that bug is neither fixed nor detected for reimbursement purposes. it's client-side and gms frequently blame the player's computer for the problem, forgetting perhaps that ccp wrote the client software.) loss of assets representing hundreds of hours of game-time to unpredictable bugs causes dissatisfaction and leads to petitions, the replies to which which cause further dissatisfaction.players naturally talk to each other so even a relatively low number of such cases has left a very deep level of dissatisfaction within the whole player-base. it's clear ccp recognises a problem with their customer support, but they lack a player perspective when it comes to solving it.mass-hiring more gms who don't understand eve's complex game mechanics but are supplied with a set of generic replies is not the answer. instead critical bugs need fixing, faster, no matter how intractable they appear. better item tracking, event logging and associated gm tools are needed. core policies on reimbursement and other gms interventions need to be reviewed with input from players."
"2. 0.0 warfare problemsthe problems with territorial warfare, starbases and sovereignty are well documented and, to a surprising extent, agreement on what is wrong has been reached. unfortunately every player seems to have their own ideas on how to revamp the system. some are wishful 'silver bullet' suggestions (\"if only local didn't exist all would be well\"), many are extremely detailed and well thought out suggestions but nothing sets them apart from other, completely different extremely detailed and well thought out suggestions. ccp is understandably left confused, tries something and then finds that huge sections of the player-base rebel against the proposed change.ccp's professional game designers have shown incredible talent and foresight time and again when coming up with innovate, well balanced and fun game-play. they don't always get it right but i believe they're in a much better position than players to design the necessary game-play changes.what's needed is for players to reach consensus on what the long-term goals should be for evolving 0.0 warfare. ccp can then design in the details, incrementally, and players can be confident that things are headed in the right direction even if they don't agree with every individual change.in my view we need to work on lengthening and slowing combat.multi-hour long continuous battles (which would have seemed fanciful when eve was first released) are now a reality and are a lot of fun for both sides, win or lose. the longest battles typically involve a carrier group tied down by a larger attacking sub-capital fleet in a cyno-jammed system and not in immediate danger, with both sides reinforcing with extra ships and sub-battles occasionally erupting along supply lines or at other points in the same system. this is a fairly specific situation but it could serve to inspire game-play changes in similar situations where one side has significant assets (titan, capital fleet, starbases and other infrastructure) on a battlefield and another force is attacking them. the current mechanism for killing starbases seems almost to discourage ongoing combat as an effective timeout is called for a day or two while both sides gather a blob. the introduction last summer of the ability to incapacitate and repair starbase modules did help a bit, but some more fundamental redesign is clearly needed.doomsdays and dreadnoughts unfortunately tend to shorten combat by providing quick death to sub-capital and capital ships respectively. they also provide powerful disincentives to combat even beginning in the first place. they hurt smaller alliances who consistently get whacked by rich alliance's titans and massive dreadnought fleets with neither side experiencing much fun. and they encourage power-blocking as alliance leaders seek to pull together the biggest dreadnought fleet possible.wars should be battles of mental and financial attrition, not wholly dependent on set piece engagements (or frequently non-engagements) where the side that brings the most people takes the trophy by default."
"3. super-capitalseve has a complex, well balanced and extremely enjoyable core combat engine. adding doomsdays to that engine was pure vandalism and they need to be removed or severely limited. i have doomsdayed several hundred ships and it's not fun for me either. titans need a new defensive, logistical or tactical battlefield role to replace the doomsday.motherships lack a significant unique role that justifies their build cost and their status as super-capitals.both super-capital classes are too 'gankable'. the fun they provide (to both sides) during their death throws should reflect their build cost. they should die because one side made a series of sound tactical decisions on the battlefield and the other side consistently got it wrong. not because they suffer a bit of lag at a critical moment. it's a paradox that by making capital ships harder to destroy we would probably see a lot more deployed and in turn a lot more would actually be destroyed."
"who am imy name is vuk lau, the same name as my main in-game character. i'm 30 years old and live in belgrade, in serbia. i'm blessed with the best wife on earth who totally understands my passion for eve (and even wakes me up to doomsday bad-guys:"

"o/ vuk.trying to be impartial:since the csm is all encompassing of issues dealing with eve.what are your views on highsec/lowsec piracy?you talk about a few bugs that have never been touched years after they still exsist. besides the color background overview, what other bugs would you be actively seeking to have removed from the game.what are you views on the arguements: \"for/against modifying local chat\", \"changing cloaking to be probable\", \"falcons need nerfd to hell\"-----i <3 ya vuk btw but these are some issues that can be a deal breaker for my votes"
"i've followed the csm pretty well and from what we have access to as players i certainly consider lavista vista a pretty good candidate for second term.i applaud his comunication skills and his general outlook, as well as his contributions to the community. he is not afraid to argue a differing point of view and if he spots something is wrong he says so.lavista vista has the vote of my accounts."
"welcome to the party"
"welcome .i love your way of thinking, even if your view on the current view of the council is somewhat flawed, for which i can't blame you, since there hasn't been a great deal of communication.the current council has, however, had problems with communication and general participation. i have personally tried a forum-based system for discussions to off-load the meetings. but there simply hasn't been enough activity on the forum to make it work.this is inherently a problem about *people*. while we can dramatically improve, which i hope to work with people like yourself in, assuming we get elected, how do we make sure people take the council seriously and dedicate the time there is needed to make the council work?i wish you best of luck, i hope to see you on the council to be frankly honest."
"thanks for the words of support, even if i can safely assume i don't have your vote as for the forums, the system can only really work if it includes accountability to the players. right now the forums are hidden, which means that there's no way for me, as an outsider, to see what happens on them. aside from my objection to formal decisions being made behind closed doors, this also has the effect of providing no incentive to work hard and participate besides the will of the individual - there's no concern about looking bad, and possibly messing up your re-election, if nobody can see that you make one post a month. and if another member does start mentioning that to inform the voters, it just looks like internal drama that turns everybody off the system as a whole. in order for forums to work, they have to provide the same ultimate level of accountability to the csm's constituents as the current text-chat meetings. people may not pay a lot of attention to the dull ones, but if something dramatic does happen(say, the chair muting a member), then it's all right there for them to make a stink about it. people act better with eyes on them, it's simple human nature."
"i have posted elsewhere that there was someone not currently on the csm who i would vote for if he stood - this is that man :) i have found myself agreeing with perhaps 90% of his posts over the course of csm 1, something i can't say of any other regular poster to the forums (including the csm member i voted for last time).among the 10% i don't agree with though is about the plan above for being able to claim low sec space without significant penalty for putting the smackdown on intruders. wouldn't this make high sec carebears (like me) even less willing to make that step if they knew that a pirate wouldn't even get a slap on the wrist for blowing them away? in my mind all that does is make low sec effectively nil sec - and if i'm not going low sec now, i sure as heck won't go nil!"
"thanks for the support, much appreciated.my goal with lowsec is to make it habitable by something other than the fraction of a percent of the population that's willing to play the game at -10. part of that is putting the risk/reward curve in the right place, but part of it is making it so that people can possibly play there without suffering the real hardship of -10 sec if they're so willing. i don't claim that it should be especially easy - i don't really know how hard it should be, that's something that would need to be tested - but the idea of player-controlled space in lowsec is a good one, so far as i can tell. it provides a stepping stone to 0.0, and it provides something for smaller combat corps that are bored of highsec to do. if you want to avoid free-gank lowsec under my plan, use the factional warfare regions. that's about half of lowsec, and it wouldn't be actively controlled by players under my proposal. a casual player looking to play a bit in lowsec can go to fw lowsec, and nobody will be able to gank them without sec loss(unless they're in a fw corp, of course) - i.e., the status quo. also, your view of sec loss as \"a slap on the wrist\" only applies to some pirates, because a lot of them regard their -10 as a point of pride. i know one who used to refuse to ask for pod ransoms because that would deprive him of his -12% hit, and make it take longer for him to get to -10. that's an extreme case, of course, but any serious lowsec pirate will not be fazed by a sec hit and a 15 minute timer. it's only the casual lowsec players who will be put off by it, and my goal here is to make their lives easier."
"colonel xaven, i have been thinking a lot how to describe my definition of \"fairness\" in a good way, but failed :-) you can see some kind of definition in my reply to jinx' fifth question. to name you an example, the efficiency and playability of a 20 million sp character depends heavily on what decisions he has made on his very first day when he has chosen his race.if you check the list of issues on the assembly hall, you will find dozens of issues which are aimed for balancing of fairness in game, and another dozen which are aimed for imbalance (example: boost my ship because i fly it). if i was in csm, i would definitely go for the issues which i feel are aimed for fairness. looking at the list of issues during the first cycle issues, such topics were: - empire war dec mechanisms (it is too easy and too cheap to grief imho)- wreck flagging for pvp (why should a neutral be able to steal the loot in hisec if you gave your blood to obtain it?)- alliance corps in factional warfare- precision heavy missiles (because they suck)- crane and nighthawk powergrid increase- remote rep and aggression (the logi ship is a great help in combat and it usually has a reliable escape through the gate, why?)- kill rights (he ganked my unskilled alt, stole my stuff, i cant take revenge?)i am also not very happy with the current income distribution inside eve. there are cases when it is more rewarding to do some easy thing without risking much than doing something difficult in a dangerous environment."
"hi neresky, i can ensure you, i will try to do something to get ccp closer to the community. i think the main problem is that ccp is doing an awful job communicating their decisions to the players. they are a company, they can make business decisions. game time card changes and the ghost training issue are business decisions. noone likes paying more and more for the same service, so it is evident that there is a customer dissatisfaction in these cases, however to make things even worse, ccp tries to mask these business decisions as something else... like \"adaptation of industry standards\" or \"fix of an old bug\". and people are outraged, no wonder. i wish they had consulted us about the ghost training issue, because i think their improper explanation is more responsible for the drama than the actual plan to remove ghost training. lacking ingame interaction with ccp is an interesting concept of yours. i fully agree, there is no in-game interaction between ccp and the players nowadays. when think back to the early days of eve, and i remember they had a \"dev chat\" time to time, usually on coldfront. it was out of game, but at least it was interactive. i wonder if something like that could be reinstated. i am not so sure if it would work, tho, back in those days there were a lot less trolls than nowadays, and i would be really sad if we managed to bring together a dev chat and some idiots would ruin it :( anyways, i am open for your suggestions, how you think we could bring the devs and the community closer to each other. as for the customer satisfaction part... most of the existing issues the csm has forwarded to the ccp were to make customers happier. there have been very unpopular steps from ccp which have caused major customer unhappiness, but these were business decisions, outside of csm's jurisdiction. the other problem csm is having is the lack of a metering tool to measure the actual customer satisfaction. the only measurable input we are getting from the community right now is the amount of whining on the forum. however i do not think that forum whining is a reliable way to measure the unhappiness of certain announced changes, as the data we get from the forums is not a representative sample of the entire player base. to help this situation, csm needs new information gathering tools. i'd favor if ccp developed these, because they are the ones who can put these to the most accessible places in game, but if they do not do it, csm could develop its own tools as well.so well... yes, i have some ideas how to improve the communication from the players to ccp. as for the other direction, from ccp to the players, well, all we can do there is giving advices to ccp, but it is not possible as long as csm only learns about the upcoming changes the same time the community does, over the players news center."
"thanks for the reply tusko it was very well written,i also miss the days of dev chat and yes going by todays climate it will be difficult to control, i also appreciate that change for the better is a long difficult road :(i miss the days when gm's and devs jumped in ships and did of bit of role play - iremember a lot of the issues which stopped it from happening but surely with todays tighter control (internal affairs) it should be good fun and will result in the widening fissure between player and gm/dev becoming less noticable - food for thought anyway.thanks again tusko"
"i'm going to try and post some thoughts on a new topic regularly. tonight after reading about yet another major theft i thought i'd talk a bit about corp theft and general member roles in a corporation. i'm going to be up front and say my corporation has been victimized by corp thieves several times. each time i learned how to make it less likely but i still think ccp could improve corp mechanics to make it even harder for a would be thief.so first, i always wondered what it is about eve that brings out the worst in folks. seems most everyone will gladly take anything that isn't nailed down in this 'verse if you give them half a chance. and of course ccp has repeatedly stated that is a fully endorsed mechanic of life in the eve universe. so basically as a ceo i am reduced to assume everyone is a crook. that makes me a little sad but i've come to accept it. currently the only folks with director roles in my corp are people i know personally and consider close friends. and by friends, i mean folks i can actually know in \"rl\". some other members have achieved a degree of trust that allows them some access to corporate assets, but nothing like a director anymore. so some would say \"big deal\". lock everything down and never trust and all is good. problem is that means that i have to basically be available 23/7 to allow the corporation to function. if i have to be away for a while keeping the corp functioning normally is very difficult. so what would i change?1. allow ceos to apply \"references\" to any member of the corporation when they leave. maybe something as simple as one line of text and a number between 0 and 10. so i can make sure that a persons deeds (god and bad) follow them. (i currently follow folks that have done us wrong for some time after they left, looking for when they change corps and then contact any new ceo they might have to provide some history.)2. corp theft seems like something that should affect your standings with say concord, you know the police of eve. so maybe that rating should contribute to a characters standing in some way. just a thought.3. as a ceo i should have a simple way to detect alts. i know there are some methods today but i think this is something that should be clear to a ceo when they receive an application.4. secure cans should be able to be locked down in a hangar by vote just like a bpo. what good is a secure can if someone can just take the can out of the hangar? right now there isn't a set of roles that lets us have an ore drop off can for each member that doesn't end up with some folks being able to take the whole can.5. i want to be able to set up a can without a password that allows me to assign access to individuals and members with a special role. now i can have a secure way to collect or distrubute things to my members. before you say \"use contracts\" i'd say that would be extremely complicated for such an easy problem.6. can audit logs should tell me when an unlocked thing is removed from the can. now i can unlocks and locks but not the actual removal.7. i'd like to be able to provide assets to members for a fixed period of time as loans. they could use them but could not sell them, reprocess them, exchange them or destroy them. they could be destroyed by normal means as part of regular use but not stolen. these are just some of the things that as a ceo i'd like to see. i am ok with corp theft in general after all as they say \"fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice i won't get fooled again!\" i'd just like the dynamics of the actions of a corporate theft to make more sense. actions should have consequences. and as a ceo i think i should have a better set of tools to help my corp run smoothly.please feel free to comment on this or suggest any other thing you'd like a \"ramble\" on.till the next time, fly safe!issler"

"i guess some people are against that because the change will prevent many older gamers from some capital competition. maybe.for myself, i can<U+FFFD>t support this thread because the change gives more focus to characters in-game."
"go on and cry about it '<>_<>'so you can't get sp without paying for it? like me? why should non-ghost trainers expect to compete with players who have skills trained with game time they didn't pay for?only true-to-the-cause freeloaders can be so upset about not getting something they don't work/pay for."
"this is my vote against this issue: i support ccp's decision to eliminate ghost training."
"i was talking to a noob today and absolutely couldn't wait to tell him that, because he was mostly training annoying short skills, that he'd be a slave to his fresh install of evemon.new player experience????for the love of god you're killing the game with your short-sighted login demanding torture."
"op is born of win and post is filled with complete truth.if i pay for your game, i should definitely be able to play it in my own style. if that includes sleep training a huge list of skills when i go overseas and cannot log in, so be it. ccp should be happy that i am paying for the game and they have profited from the relatively small stress my new play style puts on their servers.thankssigned,andre"
"although people have lived without skill queues, it certainly has been a contributing factor towards people not wanting to play this game.i took a 5 month break from eve because i simply got sick of having to plan my life around my skill trainings. that time is lost, and i paid for it.now ccp goes and bans skill training from users who aren't paying... well if you're going to do that you should go the full mile and insure skill training for those who are paying. anything less should cost you subscribers.people don't play eve to manage their skill training, they play to enjoy the game. make it easier to fulfill that in reality and you'll have a much happier fan base.so please ccp, give us a skill training queue."

"yep, i fully agree with this. i think we need some better guidelines for where to past what and when."
"well yes if the moderation was being done. topics presented by the csm, or brought by the players and later endorsed by a csm should get a sticky.i was going more towards the other extreme just for the sheer fact that there isnt the moderation and something needs to be done to stifle the filth and growing amount of spam \"ideas\" just because someone used [heyiamimportantbrackets]either way something needs to be done."
"my opinion on this matter:- ideas or issues without a previous discussion should not be put up to vote, vote and discussion threads should be cross-linked to each other.- discussions should only happen on threads dedicated to this in the appropriate sub-forums, i.e. ship tweaking goes to ships and modules, csm issues go to the jita corner, etc.- threads on the assembly hall should only be used for voting.- a dev needs to be assigned to the csm that does enforce the posting rules, only csm members should report unfitting threads in the assembly hall.this would at least create more focus on the voting aspect of the assembly hall and the democratic process represented by that. it would eliminate all the bad ideas and stuff no one cares about out of the assembly hall and puts the discussion of issues into the places where people caring for them are frequently looking around. a bit more focus and coordination would do the csm a big favour."

"capt, here's my opinion, yes this would be kind of nice, but also many people mine with multiple clients. for example i run the hauler, and two hulks at the same time. if some ass keeps warping into the belt challenging all my clients over and over. well thats about the time i get the smartbombing domis out for the little bastard. but i do think that you are on to something, the problem is this mechanic would quickly be abused. people who are sitting at war target gatecamps. i know i'm not always at the keyboard, i go make a drink or get something to eat and come back to some challenege window and my wreck. because i wasn't the 23/7 gamer i should have been. but yes i think you have a good idea, but it would be very difficult to implement while allowing safe guards for people who are eating a sandwich or posting on the forums or watching a tv show while mining."
"glad to hear a miners point of view, thanks for the input.there has to be someway to stop the macro miners and creat some fun for real players at the same time. thanks all i have to go away from the internet for awhile cause of work. will be back in a month and hopefully see some ideas.there's gotta be a way without hurting the real miners....................don't wanna do that at all."
"not going to pretend to know the answer but i would really like to see something done also."
"like the ideas on your site bunyip :)i wish there was a simple way to simply flag all macro miners as hostile - i know, impossible to do, but it would be great to implement, would mean you could shoot on site, penalty-less."
"time for one more then iam off....for you miners out there how long would be a reasonable time to acknowledge a challenge?"
"mcfly, you're in a player corp. folks shouldn't bother you unless your behavior indicates you've gone afk for a protracted period and your mining has not stopped (a convo attempt, for example). if they're really narfed at you they can always declare on your alliance.it's the npc corps that need to be fixed, disallowing the use of advanced mining ships above cruiser. period, end of story. and banning the use of freighters (skill can't even be trained in 'nuubschool' corps, trained but not used in fallback npc corps).exposed the macros to wardecs, prevent them from corp jumping all day long to avoid wars, and the macro situation will be fixed."
"that will not stop macro mining.... just makes it harder."
"well, this has clinked it. bunyip is out for my vote. another one for the harass the miners camp .when mining i am not bolted to my chair, it is useful to be capable of doing some house chores without problems (and my hulk can easily mine for 25 minutes without supervision). if you think that people should live before the screen it is your problem. edit:just to explain it better: the op feel all miners should be punished indiscriminately because some people exploit that part of the game (and giving any tool in the hand of the players to do that will insure it will be indiscriminate). similarly bunyip idea of roving npc fleets to destroy miners is not better. it will punish people for some minute of absence. it is pretty evident that there is a group of people that can't think that someone can find mining something worth doing and so bunch all people doing that as macrominers, but i see no reason to vote one of them to the csm."
"a few months back i saw an ambulation video where ccp mentioned that some of the ambulation avatars will look like they belong to specific bloodlines. meaning that if those avatars can only be used by those bloodlines then our appearance options in ambulation will be limited by a choice we made before we could of known that it would limit us beyond the portrait.at the very least we will be limited by our characters current gender. and i don't really want to be staring at a guys rear while i'm walking in stations.so what i propose is that when ccp brings us ambulation, all existing characters get to chose from all possible avatar options.i don't care if this will effect my portrait or not, and i don't care if my first avatar selection will limit later selections as long as we are informed of this beforehand.edit: just to clarify i am happy with my current portrait, and if i wasn't i still chose it. i am not happy with it limiting my choice of avatar for ambulation when we still do not know what form that limitation will take.edit 2: in this thread when i say portrait i am referring to our current character appearance. when i say avatar i am referring to the appearance of our character when we leave our ships and walk around in stations.and for those of you who are saying this because you find achura's ugly, please prove that your avatar options will be better than mine."
"that would suck. you picked a name, a gender and a look when you well knew that it would be your ingame appearance. people know you by that name, gender and look.i must say that i would be quite dissapointed if it was like you wish for it to be.the most i can think of would be to allow minor changes to the existing avatar, especially if it is in line with additional options."
"yes. back when i thought it would only be a small icon that i wouldn't have to see that often. so i didn't care too much.then ccp announced ambulation, meaning if i want to make use of it i will have to look at my character.so tell me how many people you know by the look of their avatar when they are walking around in station.now tell me how you will feel if, when ambulation comes out, you find that the only avatars you can make are ugly while people who chose a different gender and/or bloodline can avatars that look much better."
"sell your current char with iskies, buy another female and/or attractive character, one of equal value, with iskiesproblem solved."
"that's the joyfully horrible thing with eve. your decisions actually haunts you forever."
"you picked a bloodline and now you are stuck to it. why should an avatar be any different from any other action you make in eve? sorry."
"what if people didnt pay for multiple accounts and spend years skilling up in order to reach some kind of plateau in personal advancement? well, then ccp might actually have to make some content for their game, rather than just a sandbox, and thats never going to happen. ccp likes stringing you out for years on multiple subscriptions while giving you free expansions that are only 39mb big, and a game thats only 3 gigs on the hard drive after over half a decade. thats just too little work for too much money for them to change anything. can you say it any better?"
"as cool as it would be to train out my main and a alt miner nub, it won't work. and frankly, i'd rather not have this game turn out and be a huge chinese farmer market :p."
"to stay inline with other mmo's where you play only one character at the time, i'd introduce diminishing returns to this suggestion. one character would train at full speed, two characters each train at halved speed and three character each at one third the speed. other than that this has my full support."
"i also support the idea with a diminishing returns caveat. however, i would like to see it set up as a pool system with a percentage of skill points being able to be set by players on all 3 characters based on player preference. if you choose to spend 100% of your skill points on one character and nothing for your alts, fine. if you want to split your training 33/33/33 or 60/40/0 or any other combination that equals out to 100% thats good too. what i do not support is an increase to the overall pool of skill points."
"prevents scams for ipo activity of sound business plans by taking the money back forcibly. execution of repayment can happen at any time after a set date and only requires that there be isk in the account. only avoidable if barrower never again has isk in their wallet, thus hard to scam with old main characters who are known to make money.optionsisk ammountrepayment enforcement dateinterest ratebond/loan type selection and related settingsrepayment enforcement date is just the date at which the lender can click \"collect\" on the contract and the money will be drafted, as available, from the account of the barrower. if there's only a partial amount available, it's drafted as much as available. if the money is available in the form of escrow or other liquid form, trade orders are canceled and the isk is recovered. collection can be performed multiple times until the full amount is recovered.for a bond type agreement, the contract will automatically withdraw the appropriate interest rate percentage from their account each day/week/month.for a loan type agreement, the rate compounds and no drafts are made, but repayment in part is available.but you can still scamyes, but only by never again having isk in the wallet of that character, which is hugely inconvenient for a main character. this loan device is only for when you know damned well that the character is going to make the money back at some point and you just want to be sure that when they get it, you get yours.for example, i am a successful trader and would like to raise some capital. i'm good for it because i'm rich and a skilled trader. however, this device would let a lender hold me to my word under the assumption that i make money, which is true. so, instead of me for sure getting rich and keeping the capital, i for sure get rich and have to, whether i choose to or not, give the capital back.this instrument would be perfect for allowing ipo activities on trustworthy characters to be less sensitive to souring relationships. while methods of scam exist, they are inconvenient to the scammer and require dumping the character or never again using that character's wallet."
"hm, i think this is interesting.however, it does open up for a new type of scam where people borrow money, transfer the isk to their man and deletes the character. this might be against the eula, but it won't prevent it from happening, and most people wouldn't know that it's against the eula.it's kinda a can of worms. i'm really not sure what to think of it. some discussion on it would be nice."
"real-world loans are not enforced by the laws of nature, they're enforced by the laws of man. if you keep refusing to pay back a loan, eventually somebody will shoot you. the system is exactly the same in eve, except that the guy shoots a lot sooner and doesn't have nearly as nice of a uniform when he does it. i don't see a reason why this needs to change - police your own loans."
"it doesn't work like that. neither in the real world, nor in eve.in real life, you don't have to be a powerful mercenary corporation in order to give out loans. police, lawyers and courts help you enforce your rights, if the debitor doesn't pay. getting shot in the process is a rather small risk.the problem in eve is that there are many situations where loan enforcement is simply not possible. the debitor joining any sizable corp is often enough for that matter. not joining any, too.it would be good if there was some support gameside for loans. maybe not like suggested by the op, but it is still the right direction. if it was tied to a drawback (taxed, for example), it would still be a viable options to work outside such a system and take the risk for additional profit."
"it's not as simple as just making a new contract type, with enforcing rules behind it.with all the (legal *hrmf*) character trading going on, there would need to be a way to see if a character was in debt as well - or it would become extremely risky ever buying a char again. (hmmm maybe not a bad idea after all )point being, even without this complication (and i'm sure there's others), it's way too easy to abuse.even a main char could let one of his alts handle all his isk - or a 2nd main on anohter account, or corp wallet or...inconvinient perhaps, but for some (quite alot i'm sure...) it would be worth it to scam x billions of isk.------apart from that, not sure if you know or not, as you make no mention of it :there already exists several (player made) banks in eve doing loans (yes you need to put up collateral, but that truly is the only scam free way), which actually works quite well.i should know, as i run the first one ever made i'll spare you the plug though, as this isnt the place"
"all methods of scam proposed revolve around either never using that character's wallet again or ditching the character.as for verification that the character isn't in debt, look at contract history and search for any loans.with regard to the never-using-my-wallet-again scam, for people who train up alts, buy characters, and open second accounts specifically to get more tradings slots and clones, losing a wallet is equivalent to losing the character. not to mention that this scam is only good once per character, eliminating it as a method of operation for the main of a scammer.same rules that holds for all other agreements will protect one from the majority of scams. don't trust people you don't at least think you know. don't trust new characters or likely alts.as for player corp avoidance, (using a player corp wallet) just make the drafts withdraw from any wallets that the player has access to. this would theoretically allow a debt to be collected from a corp with a debtor who has access to the wallet, but if the debtor were going to scam the corp in the first place, all they need is access to the corp wallet and forget about the loan contract.this contract isn't designed to protect from all scams, but rather the minor scams that happen as a result of failure to repay. the character still exists and has lots of money, but they aren't repaying it. in the event of a broken relationship, you have the authority over the debtor's wallet, and that's much more capability to gain recourse than currently exists.by herschel's argument, we might as well have market orders requiring enforcement of the delivery of isk and items. market is a basic unit of enforcement that ensures goods and currency delivery in a mutual and reliable fashion. this contract would add weak enforcement to casual agreements where there currently is none. ask yourself how much trade would happen without the market. then ask yourself how much the viability of lending would improve with a simple contract that follows the debtor wherever they go.tl;dr/support"
"i need cash loans against my liquid equity. i can't put up collateral in this case because my collateral is liquid equity that i'm using for trading.my balance sheet is always going to be positive and associated risk is very low. only risk is that i make all the isk i intend to using the loan and then never pay it off.what this contract would allow is, instead of using non-liquid equity to back a loan, use liquid equity as an additional source of capital. my wallet is my collateral."
"would be risky, just like banking is."
"eve enforcement is fairly simple - there is enforcement in the present tense, there is no enforcement in the future tense. i see no reason to break that model, especially when said break wouldn't really do what you want it to do."
"well apparantly they explained themselves here. which is a start."
"eve has always been expensive. ccp has also stated that it's intentional, as eve is a special game. it's not wow. it's simple economics. if those 5 usd matters to you that, how could you even afford a computer, leave alone the power to run it? i don't trust you"
"communication could indeed be better. it's one of the classic problems of the growing company. my advice? fix it now rather than later. and don't be afraid to hire a training company for this. from personal experience good internal and external communication makes a job far more enjoyable and profitable"
"epic! comparing eve and wow...i like how you use the royal 'we' in your post...ccp suffer player backlash on almost all of their decisions to change in-game (and out-of-game) features. this is due to the fact that players are affected by the decisions and have a shorter-term vision (and much narrower focus) than ccp. it's a companythat exists to make money (and what a great way to make it!). i doubt if they make decisions such as ghost-training lightly...players should consider some serious rl issues that ccp faces;icelandic banks are in a very poor state...presumably ccp has icelandic bank accounts so will be affected to a degree.the world is entering a global recession (especially iceland)companies need to take steps to ensure they survive such upheavalif ccp didn't take steps to remain viable, we wouldn't be haven't this discussion...you wouldn't have eve to play anymore.part of my platform for election to the csm is the communication from ccp. however, communication is a two-way street; publicly bashing and lambasting a company and then expecting better communication isn't usually a fruitful path, imo. i think they communicate well (recent dev blogs and liveblogs been excellent), although a little more notice sometimes could be good (noting that none of us know reasons for such decisions apart from ccp's explanations).you state that ccp don't take communication very seriously and lie. strong accusations, can we have some definite proof please?even more worrying is you post negatively about ccp, then want constructive replies...take care,arithron"
"perhaps you should read the context of what you quoted, and to what it was a reply.funny that ccp told us directly that they're not affected by the crisis and are currently one of the companies that does well."
"i'd suggest the solution is;ccp to use the csm (or a group of players) as a sounding board for this kind of big-change communication.then they can get the perspective of the players reactions before making an epic error in communication. call it a quality check if you like.i'll support a solution based issue, but not a whine at large. more ideas please on how to qa this kind of communication and change."
"imo, having run 3-5 accounts for the last four years i've never done any of this 'ghost training', even for my carrier pilot. i have no idea why they would have allowed it at all, or allowed it to continue for so long. removal of it is a needed fix to work around the 'exploit' (if you will) of having a character training (or garnering rp, ect) without paying for the account.no pay - no progress. it's that simple. if you want to progress for free there are other games out there."
"the removal of the 30 d cards have everything to do with it. when the price shifted for the cards the supply dropped big time. lower supply but maintain the same demand and prices go up. if they were to match the price of the cards to actually cost the same as a 60 day credit subscription or restore the 30 day cards then supply would go back up and prices would stabilize."
"i would say ccp should just allow trading game time for isk for a fixed price, lets say 500m?!everyone who wants to sell knows what he will get, everyone who wants to buy knows what he has to pay. dont allow wtb threads anymore as they will just get bumped and bumped all day because otherwise they are away from page one within half an hour max. so.. just wts threads, 500m fixed price and we are all cool, well at least i would like it that way."
"i vote no on this one."
"does that mean that all those who set the long skill - while it was possible - and then went on deployment, lost their job, went on vacation, (insert whatever reason here), are dishonest? or are you just playing at agent provocateur?"
"support"
"that's you putting a spin on my words, the key word here is \"paying\".and it doesn't have jack to do with people using the feature/bug unintentionally. it's the ones stringing up character training time with inactive accounts that i despise. they don't contribute in-game since they're not online, they're just a waste of database as far as i'm concerned."
"i'm pretty sure that most people who ghost skill have more than one account and also buy the shorter subs which cost more and are therefore among the highest paying group of players.the object of the exercise is to net ccp as much cash as possible to get them through the credit crunch and i fail to see how enraging players and destroying the incentive to open extra accounts will help.the most hurtful thing is the lies though - csm's please stop towing the party line on this and give us some truth."
"we were all honest, decent paying customers. the difference is that we applied the mechanics in a way which coincided with the policies when we allowed our accounts to lapse - mechanics which were previously in the player guide, and provided us incentive to return every so often."
"no - no pay, no play seems fairly straightforward concept to me.those that used this in the past should be thankful it was there, consider themselves fortunate and get on with it."
"it doesnt surprise me ccp did that with lockin threahds in the csm forum that may threaghten ccp tbh if it was up to me id fire the ccp that locked it for the simple fact this is csm forum part only so **** of ccp!!! onli read dnt friggin remov anythin/lock"
"they were not intended mechanics. this was a bug which was being exploited by a tiny fraction of the population of eve. 4.6% originally if i read correctly, however this began to get out of control, they took notice and fixed the bug. it's a bug, no rights are being infringed, the cheat you were exploiting has been fixed. learn to adapt. why this keeps popping up in assembly hall mystifies me."
"ankh, i'm not getting at you here (i voted for you and will again if you run), this is about the position any communicator between ccp and the customers must be in.this thread:csm meeting thread:the cccp politburo must be holding the reigns very tight to make ccp wrangler, the csm's and every employee of ccp lie through their teeth, just what kind of stick are these people holding over you that you feel compelled to lie for them? it is often observed that a committee is the best way to solve a problem because people use all their energy organizing and ranting which leaves the real power brokers free to do as they please. then when the cod hits the propeller the committee has to take all the flak and i can't help feeling that this is where the csm's are right now.what's so magic about the number 7? stop tying yourself up in democratic knots, i can't believe that a group of people with decent iq and computer skills can still be relying on everybody turning up at a specific time and virtual place irrespective of rl commitments. a private forum, weekly vote and nominated spokesperson could be a basic suggestion though i suspect you folks have more experience than me in these things so ...why...err...the above quote???the stupid thing is that ccp are presumably trying to act in the best long term interests of eve and they have one of the best customer communication tools ever in the csm council yet they are using it like an armour repper instead of a tech iii information launcher.please please please can the csm council sort themselves out, you are not paid by ccp so do not have to tow the party line so please have no fear in confronting the bull****. i suspect that behind the ghost training decision lies some clever business decision like homogenizing the euro/usa server with the china one, attracting rl retailers into the stations with ambulation or adding some sims style element to attract more female players but without strong csm's who can bypass ccp's godawful pr the ccp honchos will keep shooting their feet to the detriment of all of us who love this game."
"there's already an issue for this and i've already raised it for discussion at the next meeting. ankh's proposal appears to suggest the need for a skill queue which i am not sure should be bundled and i don't believe i can support as i don't believe the two to be related and skill queue's have already been discussed. should ankh unbundle that i'll be happy to remove the need to discuss the similar proposal i've added.i do however support rolling back the ghost training removal."
"i was tring to keep it generic rather then go into specifics of which ships and which roles as that opens up the flood gate of pimp my chosen ship or class type arguments.there are many disscussions of ships that just don't past must in thier class or the role their class is suppose to fill.over in the ships and fitting forum you can find various disscussions on them.where i was going is simply making every ship viable in its class and in the role of it's class. a pass over all the ships and which ones are used most and which are never flown would be good starting areas.with some of the changes coming that are currently on sisi we might see a more solid return to some roles for various ships. so that is helping. but in the same vein the usefulness of other ships might cease or trend downward.every ship should have a role and a purpose to fill in the game and be able to fill that role as good as any other ship that also has that role. again i am tring to keep it generic so as not to spawn arguments over the various types, classes, or roles. in game data can speak far clearer on this then the player base and even the devs can."
"this should be something that balance teams are always looking at. and i would like at least one example for this statement:if the statement is false, then that just means that ccp is already following this suggestion."
"ok some i can think of off the top of my head.harpyenyodeimosmunnin maledictionraptorthere are others go down the ship list and think when was the last time you saw this or that ship out there. i don't claim to have been everywhere all the time so some of these ships might be a little more popular in some areas of space that i don't frequent. but these are also some that are complained about joked about ect in the ships and modules forums as well as in game in various chat channels.again i don't want this devovling into a debate over what ships are better then others. that is for the ships and modules forum.the data on what ships are flown and how often should be readily avaliable to the devs to look and see what ships are not being made, sold, flown, destroyed ect. this would give the clearest picture."
"all assault frigs need a major examination of their roles.currently interceptors trump them, which makes no sense. small, fragile ships with insande dps for their size (taranis, claw, ect) makes the slower, tougher assault frig pointless.shift interception to interceptors - increase their tackling performance (claw = good, stiletto = excellent) but remove their damage bonuses for other 'catch 'em and pin 'em down' bonuses. shift the dps bonus to the assalt frigs.and flip/flop the weapon bonuses on the wolf/jag - their current iterration is just idiotic.imo, all other ships seem to fit the role that they were intended for, with some tweaks needed to the sensor damp ships to bring them in line with their other ew counterparts."
"people have suggested a speed cap per hull already. let me suggest that again, with a twist. speed cap is a function of the hull's mass. modules that affect mass increase the speed cap but do not affect speed. modules that affect speed buff the speed of the ship by a percentage to maximum for the hull (percentage to maximum is a common mechanic in eve, so this should fit in well). since the amount of modules that affect a ship's mass is small (nanos and polies), then it's easy to control how fast a particular hull could get.keep the web and mwd changes as is. those are great; it's the changes to ship performance that are overly drastic."
"right, most are using mercury instead of lead. somehow it's easier that way.i don't like the idea either, but i think it would be possible actually - the \"minerals\" we know cannot be elements, they have to be made up of the elements we know (and perhaps a few we don't).anyway, that wouldn't do the game any good."
"brown dealer : ok u guyz, its time fo a reel game. alchemy online lol.-.- horrible idea. thumbs down."
"squirrrel i agree with you about your point for 3 or 4 level and lets say skills below x8...but i cant understand this \"but why can't you get accelerated learning through actually flying (a ship) whilst it trains?\" sry, english isn`t my native, sometimes its hard for me to catch ones point and exact meaning as author.my point wasyes we can fly ships and do \"something\"... but i`m sure you know as much as i do that eve starts its \"standby mode-until abilities will much comfortable levels\" at some point of playing which leads to frustrating, dull, boring waiting (even while _repeating_ some activities - and rising those activities boredom until you try all activities of \"chain of what you can do with your current skills\" within acceptable time and finally get yourself to the point where you left stuck with some skill and had it with all activities you can do! old skill training had a feature when you cud get away \"on vacation from eve\" while character rise his skill. then return and try new activity (paying for play time), some people say it was unfair and all. but i ask myself if its fair now to cut noobes out of that feature witch lasted for 5 years to date? or is it fair to pay for skill training only account (maybe for reused price of full price of subscription, yeah lol)?that puts eve to one shelf with other mmos, \"click!\" we are in average mmo haha.. not funny, at all.i`m sure that some payers can play eve in skill waiting mode, but not for long.from all people i tried to lure to eve only 2 stayed, noobes are scared of amounts of time they need to wait for skills...few guys from my corp who are around from 2004 got to long skills and took of to rl, they got bored.i dont think ccp will make some adv advanced learnings... and nether they will remake skills calculation... so one exit out of \"the grinding\" trap, that i see is more implantsit is not my style of playing to wait for something forever... hope to find support from people who think same."
"i agree with this. the removal of ghost training does not change anything that would call for +5 and higher implants. it would only benefit the elite, who can afford to pay for a subscription anyways."
"the question is if you \"let this go\", what you will be forced to \"let go\" next nerf?"

"work in progressthere are several open issues which frustrate me. the fact that ccp has not yet given us the 30 day gtc back is itching in the back of my mind, as well as the fact that despite popular demand, we still have not gotten a skill-queue. of course i'll try to ask about these things at fanfest, but if that fails you can expect to see this on agenda again next term.i was also disappointed in the rejection of the exploration ship issue. the csm dismissed this as lazyness, but i think this was just lazyness from their end that they did not want to look closely at the specific exploration playstyle.with quantum rise coming up, i'd like to get on top of science & industry and make sure that the features requested by players make it into this expansion. i want to see an interface overhaul with jobs being easier to set up and maintain, especially if multiple jobs are managed at once. science & industry should also be properly integrated into the corporation interface, with proper access privileges.factional warfare still needs a lot of work to be the shining gem it should be. i want to make sure skilled players get the rewards they deserve, so that factional warfare can actually earn you a living like it should, instead of only being an isk sink. currently kills do not earn players anything, and there is no point to capturing systems. something should be done there.missions are also an ungoing project. since ccp will make announcements at fanfest regarding missions, i'll wait for that, but i want to make sure missions are not the static, boring, predictable pre-scripted content they are now.for 0.0, i want to see objectives for small roaming gangs that can be completed in a relatively short timeframe. current pos warfare is too static and does not encourage much tactical insight - just bring the largest fleet and you win. mobility should be an option too, so smart players can set up diversions and then strike at weak spots - and earn some nice rewards in the process.finally, i still want to push for more player-driven justice, both in low-sec as in the other areas of space. ccp will look at bounty hunting now, and the moment they start working on something i would like the csm and players to get involved and give feedback asap.getting in touchduring the last term, i got some effective communication with the players running through the take care platform. we had discussions and focus groups, but i would like to improve on this, both by making it more transparent as well as increasing on frequency. your say in things should not end after you have cast your vote, and i encourage you to get in touch or apply for a place in the take care structure."

"\"concord provides consequences not protection\" :) the balance is pretty good at the moment, especially now with higher security status hits. if players are rich enough that they become targets then they should be thinking about 0.0 and seperating them from their assets probably helps them because they end up with less to lose.allowing wardecs against individuals even when in npc corps is something i think needs considering as a point of principle, but practically it's not important currently alongside other issues.i consider the existence of session change timers the oldest bug that should be fixed. it's true removing them challenges eve's core architecture, but they aren't fundamentally impossible to remove, they were not intended, and their enforcement is client-side which goes against ccp's policy of the client being a 'dumb-terminal' where no advantage can be gained by modding it. we've all lost pods due to not being able to jump or dock following a ship loss, and other similar session change conditions. recently a mothership theft was perpetrated as a result of a session change timer on joining gang. while i havenothing against the very harshest of thefts being possible in eve i do feel uncomfortable when unpredictable 'technicalities' have such a huge effect on eve. younger, less experienced players are hurt by a learning curve that is more treacherous than it needs to be.ships remaining in space long after the pvp timer has ended following log-off when lag is bad is a very old critical bug.not being able to warp to gang members randomly is common and old.collision detection seems to be fundamentally flawed. lag affects bumping and always has. colliding capital ships cause desyncs. and ccp acknowleged in their first devblog on speed nerfs ("
"i'd like to wish you luck, and echo some of the issues you raise -- first, having served on the student senate in college, as well as on a few different committees since then, i would like to reiterate that the importance of having good rules of order cannot be understated. this is one of the most important things to making meetings more efficient.i also agree very much that lowsec needs work, especially that it needs to be more profitable to industrialists. i find your idea of allowing groups to establish control of lowsec and take no security penalty for defending it is quite interesting, however, i do have a few questions regarding it.first, you only mention corporations. would alliances, under your proposal, be able to claim lowsec in this way? what about multiple corporations not in an alliance claiming systems together? how many systems would a single corporation be able to claim? do you see this as primarily a tool for industrialists to more easily defend against pirates, not all of whom might be below -5 security status, a tool for industrialist pirates to achieve exclusive economic exploitation of a system, or a tool for pirates to gank people for free? as you may have guessed, this is a topic very near and dear to my heart, and i hope we have the chance to work on it together in the csm."
"well, i've often disagreed with you and certainly had plenty of criticism from your lips herschel - but ultimately i do respect your decision to try to make improvements to the csm and i'm glad you've decided to run. good luck."
"good to hear others are of like mind on this one - it's one promise i'll be looking to complete as fast as possible. i have no objection to alliances being allowed to claim space, since there's a lot of alliances that exist either for vanity or to allow better organization of a group of players. not all alliances are bobswarm. the exact mechanics of it could be annoying to figure out the details on, due to the differences in code between corps and alliances, but i'm for it in principle. a single corporation can take as much space as they want. the limit should not be an artificial rule on how much space you can take, it should be incentive-based - if you're powerful enough to take 100 systems of lowsec, you're likely powerful enough to take 30 systems of 0.0, and the system should be set up such that you make more money from the latter. would you rather shoot battlecruiser rats, 7/10 complexes, and mine gneiss at the best of times, or would you rather shoot battleship(and officer) rats, 10/10 complexes, and mine arkonor? this is what i mean when i talk about a proper risk/reward scheme - players should be funneled into the level most appropriate for them by going for the best payout they can achieve, instead of giving big boys a reason to play in the sandbox or giving 0.0 over to minor corps because nobody else wants it. as for what i see it as a tool for, all of your options sound good. the group that comes to mind first is smaller corps looking to have a role in organized pvp without the fleet power to make it in 0.0, but pirates, industrialists, and roleplayers(one group you don't mention - i imagine someone like cva would gladly take on the role of being a formal police presence for their faction's lowsec) should all be encouraged to have fun with it as well. i don't like far-reaching changes to the game that only benefit one group, and so i'd like to see it work for everyone who wants to make a go of it. thanks."
"tusko has done an excellent job as an alternate / then replacement full delegate on the inaugural csm - and i definitely think he deserves a chance to serve again. he's an important voice for small unit pvp on the council and thats a direction we should definitely be encouraging."

"issler dainze - csm candidate - \"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"so tonight i thought i'd share some thoughts about the relevancy of the csm. does it matter? can it make a difference?so i suppose you could take a number of positions regarding the value of the csm. one might be that it is some sort of waste of time to allow ccp to go off and do something totally random and not aligned with the population of eve. my \"inner conspiracy nut\" and baser pesimistic voices love this argument. my irrational side also likes to think a company like ccp would believe in their hearts that ignoring and tormenting their customers leads to glory. 1. collect underpants2. torment customers3. ???4. profits!!!!thankfully medication and regular exersise keep these inner voices at bay! i think down that road madness lies..so another position might be \"best intentions but doomed to failure\". all sorts of factors could result in the csm have no positive effect on eve. ideas could be impractical. csm candidates could have agendas that favor their base. the csm could fall into chaos and never finds a unified voice. ccp could find no practical way to integrate the input from the csm into their product plans (it is very complicated to create a piece of software like eve). all these are possible. i worry about these possibilities and more. if i should be elected i would constantly consider these and other factors that could negate any real value the csm might have.finally there is the possibility that led me to run. that the csm could come together, find a structure and process that result in some great \"possible\" improvements to eve. that they work with ccp in a manner that gives their suggestions credibility and are practical to implement. that demonstrates to ccp that the csm will produce improvements that are widely accepted as positive. i think this is possible. i think i bring a skill set and perspective that will help bring this about.so i ask everyone to consider this, is it worth it to try and support the concept of the csm? to try for the positive outcome? i hope if you all think about it you will decide it is. i believe that a functional csm can be the voice of the pod pilots of eve in a way that other alternatives cannot provide. i hope you'll support all of us that have offered to try and make this happen.i have one other request. hold the csm accountable. follow their actions. provide your feedback in the forums and other channels. if the csm is not profesional in their conduct, is biased in their actions, are unresponsive to your input then make it known that you won't accept them as your representatives! raise your voices in the forums! rise up and make your grievenance clear! stand up for your rights!in the end the csm belongs to the pilots of eve. i think you could even say eve belongs to the pilots of eve. we all have the power to shape eve if we choose to accept it. let's make sure the csm helps the pilots of eve create the future we want. i the csm can, but not alone. we can suceed together or fail alone.issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakastu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordstuffs getting better! stuffs getting better every day!"

"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.greetings fellow galentians, noble minmatarr and others. recient events have changed the nature of the eve universe forever. where once there was (relative) peace and serenity, now there is only war. is it mans nature that denies him every chance at a peaceful tomorrow? no. it was the caldari. and their backers. the broker always has been a merchant in human misery and through his puppets a new age of strife is upon us. if elected to the csm i would work towards a future where galentians, minmatarr and one day maybe even amarr work together to burn the caldari filth from the stars.also lower taxes, full social welfare, less gun control and also a promise in writing to \"think of the childers\"seriously though. i'm a long time player, i just play for fun, dont do too much 0.0 but also cant stand too much mining. if you want someone who only plays about as much as you do (maybe less) doesn't run with the big boys and would prefer ccp do more pve content rather than more pvp balances (if time allows, those guys work hard) then i may be the guy for you.also: boosh!"

"hi.i'm some nondescript rare poster of the eve-online forums who has been playing the game continuously for a little over a year now. i tried eve in late 2005 when i discovered that wow really sucked but i was looking for something to do. i was shocked i'd never heard of eve and gave it a try. i was unable to find my niche at the time and quit playing in early 2006. i tried it again late 2006 but again didn't like mission running over and over and really had no mentor or friend(s) to play with so i quit again.a year later i discovered my current corporation, merch industrial. merch industrial is a member of the evil goonswarm that is cool to hate right now as i understand. my primary focus of play has been both pvp and industrial. currently i'm in a pure industrial phase which consist of 0.0 mining (ice & ore), use of exhumer/rorqual ships, ore & ice compression, pos logistics and is my primary source of income.i am a macintosh client user primarily. i run up to three clients right now on a single mac pro across two displays for mining operations with three accounts. zareph is my 'main' but i have two others that are part of merch industrial that i use as pure mining/rorqual alts.i am upset about the ghost training nerf. i think it could have been handled better and maybe accounts created before a certain date should have left the ability to continue to do it, or other feautres should have been implemented simultaneously to address why ghost training was so vital. there are several skills out there that i feel are a ridiculous waste of my life to wait on, and paying to sit there and do nothing on skills that are required to do anything 'cool' is not how i like to play a game.i'm ambivalent about the speed changes. on one hand, i can see the need for some, on the other hand, i think someone took the nerf off the bat and beat the poor guys senseless.i feel 0.0 is the redheaded stepchild of eve, and that there are some good ideas for change, and some crazy ideas for change i don't like, and i have posted some of my thoughts personally but i would expect support from the community and have no set agenda i want to push.i'm excited to hear an orca is coming, i had raised an issue as an individual as a assembly hall and seemed to get some good support around it so who knows if they were doing it anyway or that had anything to do with it."
"i'm sure there were many productive discussions on the matter. have we mentioned that ccp are adding certificates and medals to the game?"
"the emo rage quit tears are very flowing in this pointless thread. but they taste so good.1. ccp says they are going to fix lag issue.2. ccp removes 'ghost training'3. cheap players quit.4. rest of eve players who pay to play get better frame rates.niiiiiiiiiiice."
"wait a sec, you're saying that because of ghost training, ccp decided to make some skills a month long and have them as requirement for new ships?i tried a half dozen replies, but i think this fits best into this forum and sums it up just as well:wtf?"
"i pay 3 account with real money, so explain me why you are not paying for something you use. is like my monthly fee will cover your skill training on ghost mode, and that is not fair. i am not a fun of ccp, but they need money to keep everything running. btw, you guys complaining about stop of gost training, are you working for free in rl?why ccp employers do that."
"good job with ending of ghost training. i think ccp will lose more money if they reactivate ghost training. first of all, players that use frequently this feature have multiple account and use them alternatively, this mean that pay in total for one account and train skills on 2 accounts. ans this is an unfair advantage over the regular players. second, if ghost training will be reactivates, will look like ccp agree with that and will encourage players to use it, and this means that more and more players will use ghost training and ccp will get less money.good job ccp"

"blasters are getting the shaft as a side effect to the nanonerf"

"time to target is essiential with any blasterboat due it's very limited range, currently blasters are well balanced in the sense that you may or may not die before getting into range, using abs would mean death without a shot fired (well a hit that is).summary thread of important posts:"
"the time to get into effective engagement range, actually. fitting an ab can make it take twice to three times as long to get into range, it's not at all unthinkable that this can make it *impossible* to deal effective damage in a gang. getting into range is extremely important.however, that's only half of the problem - the second part of the problem is that the 60% web uncovers what was already a hole in the tracking formula - it becomes increasingly difficult for blasters to deal effective damage (even supposing that they can manage to get into range). blasters with 90% webs are extremely sensitive to transversal - the problem gets almost infinitely worse when the average transversal in web range goes up by 3-4x (10% -> 40% = 4x increase in transversal, adjusting for slower ships gives a 3x increase in tranversal).come on vista, you know better. :)-liang"
"thx for the effort to post it here but i don<U+FFFD>t think it will go anywhere further here as in the game devolopment forum. the thread got tons of info also a lot of good math and input from blaster ship users.bellum even changed the op because nothing realy happend, not a single note about it in the dev blog, not a dev post that explains the planed route and focusing on the problems that it cause, not a single adjustment about it on sissi in the current state(think the remove of gun tracking and range was more like a accident, glad they at least looked into missles a bit) not realy intedet as a test with a adjusted system. the changes of the nano nerf hit any unanoed ship used in small scale and solo pvp just as hard as any nanoed by making it fare harder to control range, tackle targets, pin them down with webs and hit in web range. all the core elements of blaster ships that are needet to survive and be effective geting a hit where the usablity is more than just qestionalbe(it is qutestionalbe allready now under current tc conditons) after it. blaster ships are at the reciving side of the nerfbat since 2 years non stop now, but this compleetly removes them from the list of usable pvp ships, together with a huge amount of ships that are geared to solo and small scale pvp in her orginal way.in the beginning i was for the nano nerf, turning speeds down to a more sane level, alowing more counters and give other fitting styles a come back but as it turned out this patch nerfs so many things in solo/small scale pvp that it is not even funny to see for somebody that loves and does the so called dead pvp style named solo. if somebody think this is a stelth nano whine check my stats on bc i don<U+FFFD>t like nano ships and don<U+FFFD>t use them very often, and yes i got some in my hangar. bottom line, they don<U+FFFD>t care, thats it."
"djego, i know we haven't always seen eye to eye... but i couldn't agree more. ccp simply doesn't care at this point. blasters and acs have been deliberately sidestepped at every turn when ccp has discussed the \"nano\" nerf.it's really frustrating though, because they gave us plenty of time to realize that there was a nano nerf coming (over a year!), and some of us got to training things that didn't have anything to do with nano ships - ships that had been traditionally effective.nerfing battleship mass/acceleration/velocity and the web nerf was just out of left field though. the game is roughly fine outside of a few nano problems, and is balanced far better than it's been in ages... adjustments of this magnitude make it a brand new game in everything but the abysmal ui and even worse pve experience.people like you are the the people i'll miss most when i end up dropping 3 35m sp characters on the floor.-liang"
"well, from the sisi testing i have been doing, an ab works pretty well. however, it *is* just sisi testing. do also remember that if you do get into 7,5km range, assuming you had a mwd, you will have some inertia build up that will get you close. i assume most people fit a web to their blaster-bloat where it would be needed to(very small gangs). so once you do get inside that 7,5km range, you will both have inertia and a web. i'm not saying that's perfectly good. but do remember that all your targets are going to be equally as slow as you. i think it's a matter of blaster boats taking a bit more actual skills than they used to. however, this is just based on theory and i think we will have to wait and see until the final tweaks have been made to sisi to see how it actually works out. there's still daily changes to sisi all the time."
"exactly - and sisi testing usually discounts the situations where someone literally does *not* want to engage you. getting inside 7.5km before kicking off your disruptor is simply not an option. even the slowest of ships are able to warp before a blaster ship can cross the required range to put a point on someone. fitting the scram + dual web is simply so that you can get someone going slow enough to actually deal damage to someone. why should this be required when you can get 80-93% of blaster damage from a certain other turret ship out to 50km+?as a general rule, they will not be as slow as you are. there's multiple reasons: not everyone armor tanks and not everyone is running in battleships (in fact, it'll be flat stupid to fly a bs sized blaster ship after this patch). this patch is probably not supposed to nerf things that weren't even working as well as should be expected on tq. yet it does.if it were just a matter of using skill, it would be fine - but it's not. additionally, there should be a certain amount of consideration for the difficulty with which you are able to successfully bring your damage to bear.according to what i've read, there are changes by the hour on sisi these days, but they're almost wholly focused on the new missile damage formula. in any case, that doesn't explain why ccp has deliberately ignored and side stepped the blaster/ac issue time and time again when it's been brought up.-liang"
"and it actually looks like there was a live dev blog where zulupark has said that there are no problems with blasters. after his previous record of believing that the helios had 3 high slots and that gallente recons were not negatively affected by the damp nerf... i give up.ccp has hired morons and has decided to suicide eve. i guess it's a good time for \"certain\" other mmos to be coming out. at least they're more fun anyway.-liang"
"well i would realy sugest reading the thread a bit, it isn<U+FFFD>t this bad like many other threads regarding changes and stayes on topic most of the time.problem is everything bigger than a frigate will need a mwd to get in range quick, especialy when fitted with turrets that got a short range. it is possible to use ab on cruisers and hacs and it is indeed very effective in 1o1s but it is sissi, people want to fight you, while in general pvp on tq you have to force them not to warp off most of the time.here starting the problems when it takes to long to get in range most of the targets will warp off, so you need a disruptur to stop the other ship from warping off. the scrambler sounds good in theorie but any ship that got a doubt if it can win will be warped off long before you in range for a scrambler. the other point is the ship need fare more cap(more mwd cycles) to get in range and it takes fare longer meaning you take fare more damage most of the time. since blaster ships got the shortest range and have to mwd into web range to be effective most off the time this is realy a big drawback.the interia will carrie you further even with mwd off but the target will move out of your range even within web range. a plated blaster ship deaccelate like a soap on a wet flore, with the 60% web it is very unpredictalbe where it lands so both ships have to manuver in web range even more than out of web range. that puts blaster ships in a disavatage in the end because it got the shortest range, a thorax with ions or electrons are mostly helpless against a other cruiser/frig if it<U+FFFD>s further away than 4-5 km of the target with mwd shut down it allready looses the fight, if you are still able to use it you burn more cap by mwding in web rage. a blaster bs got a very hard time to, the other ships will get close and start orbiting what is absolutly enught at a cruiser class, even webbed to outrun tracking compleetly.this is a serious problem for any kind of short range fitted solo ship in the cruiser, bc and bs class. hope you keep the liang forum bot running at least. realy not shure, the game changed much in the 2.5 years that i play it, most of the time not in the better direction in my personal opinion, but well we will see.edit: damn the liang forum bot was faster than me."
"i'm not certain that i'm willing to give ccp the cash that it would take to keep liang up. i could buy a bottle of liquor per month or try 3 new mmos per month with the cash i'll save from dropping eve.i'll miss the really exceptional people that i met in eve, though. i'm thinking about dropping an eve mail address into the forums for people that want to get ahold of me. for now, warhammer is probably the best solution - liang's settled down there as a shadow warrior on iron rock.-liang"

"when i started playing a little over a year ago, i chose galente because of their awesome ship design.i didn't know i was getting on board a sinking boat. at first i was excited about the nano nerf, because that meant that my deimos that i had been skilling up for a long half a year was finally going to pay off, and that ships that i could never dream of catching would finally be in range to die. then this **** comes out. it really woudln't be that hard to fix really, just give blasters a boost in tracking, or hell, dps, so they could compensate for the lesser damage they pumped out. at this point, about the only thing they're good for is suplimental dps when shooting at titans, and other cap ships. please, stop nerfing galente before you lose 1/4 of your player base because the race sucks."
"the tracking formula needs fixing. do the devs not understand the concept of size vs distance? fix that and blaster 'tracking' issues go away, then work can be done on the dps balance between blasters/torps/pulses.personally, i'd say cut the damage on the latter two."

"this was a part of the forum reworking issue we raised with ccp just 2 weekends ago.however, it was a case of me(who raised the issue) talking at ccp(wrangler was there to discuss the issue, but there was no discussion as he didn't seem to care all that much).i'm disappointed in that. i will raise this issue as soon as possible. merging those 2 forums is nonsense."
"i've got a lottery thread going, which i was happy to see on top of the events forum. seeing it on top of events and gatherings just makes me feel guilty, for blocking out mention of rl meetups in exchange for a lottery post being on page one. i don't know exactly how the forums should look, but these two being together is silly."
"i beg to differ. bunyip flies a hulk and a mackinaw, and is heavily into mining and manufacturing. i explained in my webpage that the 5 mins warning will allow those who are afk for a short bit to react to the message in local.i have no problem with mining, and my ore distribution idea should prove that. i do have a problem with the people who get an iteron 5 with 1 mining laser and set it to a field while they go to work, or those who use third party programs (aka macros) to mine and deflate the economy of the game.if the macroers are taken out or at least hindered pretty greatly, it will put more people into mining (since it will be an economically feasable choice) and that's the goal i'm trying to achieve. my idea in no way harasses those who pay attention to this game, even if they forum troll/handle an emergency with their kids/grab a bite or a drink.i will not engage in the mudslinging that you are trying to do. i simply state the facts, and i'll let the people decide on my credentials based on my input and views in the forums which i use so often."

"this op delivers, so why stop at gender.sometimes i like to look at boobies which my male avatar lacks and as such i should be able to switch to a female avatar so i can wear skimpy clothes as well."
"avatars are nothing like any other action in eve. they're a one-time choice that can't be reversed or compensated for in any way. with skills if you get some set of skills, you can always get the other set of skills. with ships if you buy one ship, you can always make more isk and get another ship. with an avatar, you do it once and you're stuck. not only that but you had to make the choice with a complete and total lack of information on its future consequences. it's ridiculous that ccp should force people to make such a permanent choice without having any idea of what it will do!i certainly did not know that it would be my in-game appearance. i understood that my in-game appearance was that of a spaceship. ccp is suddenly changing it so that those previously irrelevant decisions now suddenly have consequences, some of which i could never have possibly predicted! (i.e. the bloodlines suddenly having visible differences) if ccp is going to arbitrarily change what impact those decisions have, i should be given the option to reconsider my choice.i know ccp is going to let you remake your avatar since it's not possible to port your portrait into the ambulation system. i just don't know to what degree they'll restrict your options."
"can you say \"vanity avatar\"?: o )honestly i don't think its going to be that big of a deal.but oh well."
"guess i will laugh at people who just went for some 'i dont need charisma anyways' chars and now got ****ty avatars but.. but... the forums told me to get an achura to be cool!well, now live with it. as you didnt put even little effort into creating your char/avatar you clearly not even a little bit rp minded. so why care now?"

"i hope we get a bit of a wardrobe to choose from, if not at first maybe further down the line. maybe the chance to buy new clothes, pay for a haircut, a tattoo maybe.i can see customising their avatars being a great way to get people to spend isk."
"so you're a repressed little gay? \"oh god i cant be staring at a guy's rear.... yet i am... still... staring\".do you people even think about it before you make a new thread? i mean, its just obvious from a game design perspective why you should actually be the same gender, race and bloodline as your old avatar. i dont see how \"im scared of my sexuality\" is a valid excuse to change that design."
"if it's so obvious then would you mind explaining it?this is asiofjioaewf's main. i originally posted on asiofjioaewf by accident. yes i did put effort into creating my avatar, and yes i am rp minded, but there were no rp capabilities in the game at the time i made my avatar so there was no point in rp-ing. if i wanted to see a bunch of lines of text next to pictures of heads i'd go to an irc chat room."
"because all the other decisions i could of researched beforehand to work out the effects. and as i said in the op, i don't care if my first avatar choice limits me later. my problem is that there is currently no way for players to know what avatar options ambulation will limit us to.so tell me what other decisions i could of made that permanently limit me which i couldn't of researched beforehand. my portrait is the small icon on my posts and in-game. my avatar will be the look i have while walking around in stations. we don't get to see what avatars look like until ambulation reaches the test server.i like my current portrait, and even if i didn't i knew that i would be stuck with it when i made it. my problem here is that when ambulation comes along, i have no idea if i will like the avatar options open to me.this would be an option, assuming that character trades are still allowed when ambulation comes out and that there aren't enough people wanting to do this to drastically inflate the character prices."

"so... what if i borrow the money, start my own corp, transfer it to my corp wallet, and then never put isk into my personal wallet again?i can still buy/sell things... i'm not really crippled in any way."
"as detailed thus far, the lender can draft it from your corp account if you have access. only way around that is to transfer it to corp wallet and then give up roles. solution could be to limit role granting/removal when under a debt contract, requiring that the debt be paid before the roles can be changed by any character for any character. essentially, the toon is hot-potato until the debt is paid back.this isn't a tool to prevent scamming.currently missing in the financial toolbox are:convenient, easily verifiable, and demonstrable proof of debt and terms of debt via the process of initiating debt.ways to keep financial agreements honored when corp shuffling is involved and no scamming was initially intended.weak enforcement of casual player-player loans to lower the propensity to run with the money. current barrier carries zero consequences.collateral system for characters with large amounts of liquid assets. non-liquid equity as collateral sets 50% as maximum leverage. with capability to leverage against wallet, 100% is maximum while staying solvent.these roles are what this tool is for."
"i've always wanted this mechanic, but your missing a few big factors that you need with any loan:1)down payment2)collaterali would actually prefer a collateral system rather than a collection system. if you put a ship on as collateral, then you could 'hawk' your raven for the money to fit it. assuming you made enough money to repay the lender, then you kept the money and the raven. if you failed to do so, then you'd lose your collateral.it would be cool if you could put the ceo role as collateral... mortagaing your soul..."
"i cannot say that i'm innocent of any 'ghost' training, but i did not abuse it (i only used it for two skills while i had to take breaks from the game for a short time). what i'm upset about is their handling of the situation, giving people two days of warning before yanking the plug and offering flimsy excuses for their actions.it was ccp's right to stop ghost training, but they could've done it in a far more diplomatic way. in doing this, they shot themselves in the proverbial foot. ccp needs a better channel for communication to players, and they need to give the players a chance to present their side to the developers before such rash action."
"you have made an accusation against ccp lying, and i fail to see how your offered 'proof' is actually proof of any sort? they stopped 30 and 90 day gtc (plus 50 and 100 day ones), instead opting to sell 60 day ones. as they are a product of ccp, they can decide a price and charge what they wish. as far as i know, credit card or other subscription payments have not been changed.comparing prices to play the game against 30 and 90 day gtc isn't a fair comparision, since they no longer exist! obviously, ccp want players to pay longer term subscriptions, as it makes for easier financial planning (known cashflows etc). essentially, what you are highlighting is that the game got more expensive to play if you buy gtc? as ccp sell gtc to 3rd parties, it would make sense that they still require a base cost, then profit added on for resellers. hence, they are more expensive than paying ccp direct.you also alludeto 'other of those things'. what other things show they lie?arithron"
"i found that artical muddled the issue more than it clarified it. because it is an artical written by a third party, it is hard to know how much of the lies/misinformation in that artical come from ccp and how much comes from mmorpg.com.the revised dev blog (as it is now) does a much better job of presenting the case for the change.yes, ccp bungled this announcement: it should have had more warning and less misinformation in its original release. however, i think that once ccp saw their mistake, they have done what can reaonably be done to correct it.still, it wouldn't hurt for the csm to remind ccp of the importance of being up-front and honest with their player base, and making sure that their announcements are handled properly. ccp established its roots with an open relationship between the developers and the players. lies, misinformation and general spin-doctoring is expected from a company such as blizzard. ccp has set themselves up to a higher standard. hopefully they continue to strive for it: tell it the way it is, and don't insult us with bull****.as for the merrits of this specific change: the nerf bat will adventually hit everyone. this particular nerf bat has hit very close to home for myself. but such is life. if i am truly honest with myself, i can understand why this change was made, even if the initial presentation was lacking."
"i am voting against the nerf of speeds"
"well i am voting for it."
"vote forvote against"
"honestly, you have no clue if ccp are making more money or not from their gtc changes and/or the ghost training changes, so don't make statements about it.how are the gtc sellers being greedy, don't you want to get the most \"bang for your buck\" with anything you do both in eve and in rl."
"not signed. it's basic supply and demand. why should i sell you a cheap gtc if there are a dozen people lined up to buy it from me at a higher price? any sane and rational person would do exactly what those sellers are doing, this isn't some incomprehensible evil or market manipulation conspiracy.it's no different than any other aspect of eve's economy. if you get ccp to step in and reduce your gtc costs, i expect ccp to step in and reduce my ship costs. i want hacs/recons for 20 million isk, greedy sellers shouldn't be allowed to raise the prices as high as they have."
"ccp cant cap the cost, or the whole idea behind the gtc system falls on its ass.the price needs to determined by supply as well as demand. if the supply side sees a large discrepancy between the isk it gets for a dollar here compared to at ige et all, they will sell less cards and fuel more isk sellers.ccp don<U+FFFD>t want that, since it<U+FFFD>s both harmfull and a loss of income."
"there is no conspiracy and accusation definately wont get you anywhere, but theres no doubt the balance has been upset. i'd say its rather like the ammount of hac's builders / sellers drop , while the ammount of hac buyers went up, you would be annoyed that you had to pay 200mil for that hac, if you could get one.if i was a seller , i would be driving prices up too, after all, you got to look after number one. but i would certainly call my self greedy and rub my hands together all the way to the bank. but even in rl , theres laws, methods and amendments put in place to try stop monopoly, inflation and a broad economic failure. although it happens from time to time, which is what we are seeing here. we normaly dont realise it and do something about it when its too late. but that dosnt mean we should just simply do nothing about it."
"fair enough, point takenguess we will just have to let it run its course then."
"to the op.you are playing the game for free, buying the gtc with isk. quit complaining tbfh."
"if no one can afford them, the price will go down as demand decreases. are people really this ******ed about how the free market works?"
"this. the only reason prices are so high is because people are willing to pay them. clearly there are people out there who want that gtc more than you do, and they're willing to pay extra to make sure they get access to the limited supply first. if prices exceed the equilibrium point where demand becomes less than supply, prices will drop again as the sellers start competing to have the lowest price and attract the limited number of buyers.this is economics 101. deal with it."
"well, i have been told, i have an iq of that of a gallah !!"
"if you flesh the idea out and it is reasonable i would support it but right now all i get the impression is you want like a 1k damage 20km range mini ddd.that or you really really hate phoenix pilots and would to further enrage them."
"christ, darius, you are breaking all sorts of preconceptions for me lately man. stop scaring me, and do something evil, and sinister, otherwise i just might have to vote for you, damn it!"
"nobody said the skill couldn't train as long as the account was paid. vacations and deployments are the subject of \"we need a skill cache now.\" ghost training was never necessary for extended afk sessions. it was a necessity of i-don't-pay-for-my-sp players.vacation and deployments shouldn't and won't kill accounts that are set up to be paid/have enough gtc's. losing your job...quit eve and get a life"
"the best saylors stand on the landsa knife can cut from both sideswhat is wrong with ego and business if at the end its a survival of the fittest?as long as the csm candidates remain honest, loyal and trustworthy to their promises and do their best to contribute on developing a better game, i dont see the problem on selling the brand a little? ur idea on the polls systems is a nice one, i agree something like that would give more accurate statistics on certain topics.even if ccp created csm for pr stuntings, what is wrong with that? it gives players an extra option to set a goal to work for or something like that, you know. its coolcsm could form a strong in game platform competing with ccp to fill those laggy 0.0 gaps and all that if indeed participation will occur in the near future.its up to the candidates to figure out how to arrange their agenda for their membership and hopefully the third or 7th csm will be able to overrule a \"tanknerf\" if the players want to by then because we are all playing battleship online from the upcoming \"speed nerf\""
"say what?"
"two things. one, you may want to edit your cv a bit - even most geeks make fun of larping. two, what's this take care business on your website? it doesn't seem to be a csm slate, given that none of the rest of them are running - is it just a group of friends you're using as campaign advisors? also, best of luck to you."
"maybe, but then again people that roleplay in a videogame get made fun of as well by the non-roleplayers, but that does not mean that roleplaying in whatever way is dumb. i think that roleplay spices things up in eve. and i don't see me getting some fresh air a few times a year being bad. anyone can apply for the take care platform, these are people that have shown interest in discussions and i consult with them to hear their opinions on issues. usually i talk to a few of them and a few random people at the same time. being a csm is not a solo endeavour, you have to consult with the players, and these are some of people that help me in that aspect. i should explain this a bit better in my op, thanks for that."
"after you and the current csm balanced concord \"read destroyed high sec pirating\", what game style are you planning to destroy if elected again ?"
"could you start with trolls, pretty please ankh?"
"i have to say my experience of eva in the csm: online, in virtual chats, face to face at ccp hq and in the months since has been uniformly good. she's dedicated and capable and approached the csm concept with an open mind and analytical eye. even during the worst bits of the first session eva kept her head and remained balanced and positive and helped a great deal as one of the officers on the council. even though by her own admission she didn't have much experience of matters eve pvp she has listened to those that have, and has turned her formidable intellect to solving the problems faced by small unit fighting in the increasingly turgid environment of 0.0 sovereignty war. personally i think she'd make an excellent chair for the 2nd csm and i hope she's able to build on the support she managed last time around. she truly deserves a 2nd seat on the csm and i think we the players will be benefited tremendously if she goes all the way and wins this thing."
"your record shows the opposite tbh, ie voting down bane's \"capital ships online\" proposal."
"to be honest it was a muddle-headed proposal that needed to be voted down by anyone that actually read the small print. trying to address a perceived prevalence of capital ships in 0.0 fighting by actually reducing the skill requirements to fly capital ships? (and make them even more prevalent) how does that make sense?"
"if you were voting on a design document that ccp were bound by blood oath to implement then that would be a valid point. but even if the details were muddled something better could've been hashed out with ccp face-to-face. effectively voting to put off even discussing the ridiculous capital spam you see these days was a huge disappointment and easily the csms biggest failure so far. unless you're just fine with capital blobs, titan spam and only big players who can afford these toys dominating 0.0.whatever your view it's certainly the antithesis of small gang love in any case."
"like jade said, that was due to the fine print.and bane voted against issues that would imply a rework of 0.0 sovereignty mechanics.there is cause and effect.the cause is the stupid pos-centered warfare. the effect is blobs because people will bring the biggest fleet, as that guarantees a win.besides, it was very clear from what direction bane was coming in his proposals: either nerf our opponents who have more capitals than we so we can blob them with our sub-capitals, or allow all of us to fly capitals as well. - at least that is how it appeared to me.i want to deal with the cause, and not band-aid the effect in some half-assed way. to this effect, i would propose objectives for small, mobile gangs to accomplish. this would force existing powers to patrol and secure their space; if not, opponents or just random groups of roaming space-brigands will have a nice opportunity to come and pillage. with small, fast gangs, they should be able to raid and make off with some loot before those nasty capital ships arrive on the scene.this will make 0.0 as a whole more dynamic and interesting, especially for those with only a limited amount of time to spend on eve, as something can be accomplished in a matter of hours instead of picking your nose for ages until that stupid pos comes out of reinforced.either way - we will discuss 0.0 mechanics at the fanfest, and i will discuss all parts of this issue, the 0.0 sovereignty mechanics, pos warfare and capital ships.in addition, i want to see some more incentives and depth added to factional warfare, which would encourage people to actually fight over the plex sites in there. right now fw is just an isk sink, but i think it should be a low to medium income carreer option.low-sec pvp remains tricky, with ccp turning down the bounty hunting ideas. still i'd like to see improvements for lowsec and player-driven justice/security as well."
"my name is qwaarjet, and i support this candidate good luck mate."
"thanks everyone for support."
"you say:\"allowing wardecs against individuals even when in npc corps is something i think needs considering as a point of principle, but practically it's not important currently alongside other issues.\"do i understand you correctly that you are for the idea of allowing players or corporation to wardec a pilot that is in a npc corp?"
"adding my support to lavista's campaign. i've worked with him for over a year on ebank, during which time he's become a core member of our team. during his previous csm term, he showed a level of maturity exceeding his age. i think he learn a lot through the process, and would be well placed to build on what the first term achieved.good luck!"

"how exactly would the game mechanics work so corporations or alliances could claim lowsec systems as their own?the concept is good but how you implement it is crucial."
"i'm not sure. fortunately, i don't have to be. ccp is not looking for us to submit patches, because they have hundreds of their own employees to do that. they're looking for us to submit ideas, and that's what i'm trying to do here. if i try to get too specific, the proposal will actually lose utility for them, since it loses the ability to be fit into existing design plans and it limits the scope of where they can go with it without having to worry about players accusing them of betrayal. they have coders and testers, and i trust a team of full-timers to do a better job designing and implementing this system than a single amateur can. i'll tell you my rough design goals, though, which i expect ccp to basically share. i want \"lowsec sovereignty\" to be attainable in a single system by a small (5-10 member) corporation if they are active, dedicated, and competent. i don't want the rewards to be too great - the goal is to allow you to defend your space, not to give you a boatload of money for checking off an arbitrary goal or two. and the method for attaining this \"sovereignty\" should be via doing things that actually make sense, both from an rp perspective and from a gameplay perspective. establishing money sinks that serve only as well-defended spots your opponent has to knock over to take control (deathstar poses) is definitely something to be avoided. i certainly agree that implementation is crucial, as well. this is not an idea i'm dead-set upon seeing implemented, because i know very well that it can be done wrong and it would be bad for the game if it was. i'd rather see it not happen than see it happen badly. however, it's something that i think could be done very well if all goes right, and as such i consider it worth bringing forward."

"issler dainze - csm candidate - \"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"thought i'd talk about aliens in eve. i think it is an interesting topic. i can't say that i'm for some major incursion of little green men but that's not to say i wouldn't like to see something involving aliens. basically i'm for ideas that add some storyline possibilities, some new variations in our eve experiences of offer an excuse for creation of some new cool stuff. so what could we do with aliens? here are just a couple of ideas:1. strange new spacial annomolies that can be scanned and that lead to the encounter with aliens. we already have ai that is out of control and other mob factions. aliens could be interesting new mobs. perhaps give them behaviors that would make it seem as though they are studying us (or better yet, preparing for some sort of invasion).2. let them drop something special. cool alien technology. add some npcs that seem to be collecting it and maybe add some sort of cover up storyline to go along with that. could create a premise for some interesting new missions.3. make them able to pop in and pop out in a manner that would suggest some sort of better interdimensional technology. imagine you are mining and suddenly a group of alien ships pop in and scan you then just as mysteriously dissappear. also give them tactics that are truly \"alien\". right now all mobs pretty much act the same. some reason for variation in the mob experience seems like a good thing to consider.4. they could drop earth artifacts that could create a whole bunch of interesting story line developments. imagine for example that some races leadership begin to react to the idea that life on earth has continued and begin huge political struggles or shifts in religous beliefs that create a drive to find a way to create a way back to earth.5. our first encounters could come as a result of the opening of some new space. just finding alien archeology alone could create some great new content.6. have them provide us with some sort of \"puzzle\" to solve. maybe they lead to the discovery of an alien gate that can only be made to work when some \"secret\" is uncovered. this could be how some new systems could be introduced.7. or here is a crazy idea, not everyone sees them at the same time. ccp could roll this out unannounced and we could create eve's own ufo nuts! imagine the fun as you try and convince all your corp members that there really was a ship right there in the belt scanning you when they didn't see it. i can hear the accusations of space madness already! :-)so what i'm suggesting is not dramatically alter the eve we love but let's face it, in the vast 'verse there has to be \"others\" out there somewhere. and those \"others\" could create some great story lines, missions and rich new content without adversely affecting the eve we now enjoy. i wouldn't be pushing for aliens to be added to eve but if the opportunity to suggest new content in eve comes up i think aliens offer some great opportunities.stuffs getting better! stuffs getting better every day!issler dainzeceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord"

"you say regarding what you stand for:\"...(eg, my core principles/believes of environments, larger/more dense solar systems, vastly increased resources in 0.0, subsystem warfare and culture of introducing counters +lore instead nerfing content.) more small gang pvp, war declaration victory conditions, turning a risk avoidance mentality to a risk management mentality...\"what exactly do you mean by;-larger/more dense solar systems?-culture of introducing counters?-lore instead nerfing content? (not sure what lore means)itukki"
"this refers to how i believe space and star systems in eve are far too small, instead of a solar system supporting hundreds of people, corporations of 20 can effectively maximise the resources of a constellation. alliances sprawl over vest portions of the map, and the ability to co-exist with smaller entities within regions is extremely difficult do to the limited number of resources and the lack of variety in the ways in which systems can be harvested.essentially, my goal would be to make solar systems feel bigger and more valuable, by making the majority of 0.0 systems resource rich, and different in there composition.down the line, this naturally leads on to environments, new possibilities and niche's for technologies, structures and play styles, and corporations and alliances eventually adapting to the environment in a way that makes them unique.these are really one in the same thing.i believe the way in which changes to the game are made violate the premise of an rpg, or, at least do more harm to the brand and the experiance than the game design improvements that are usually follow.i believe that in the majority of cases, rp can be used to as a method of either finding a solution to a \"balance problem\" or at least explaining it once changes are brought to bear. it's this type of maturity that seeps down into the community, it sets the tone. - imagine, instead of a heap of people thrashing out a bunch of random figures and there own points of view about a subject, people would think more about the brand, the history, the way the balance of power may inevitably change and suggest changes based on an active storyline (see lore)interweaving them deeper into the fabric of the game. obviously, this would all be done under the ccp' guiding hand, but this would at least help bridge the disconnect between the player base and the scripted lore... ..."
"i fear that the 0.0 npc gatecamp is not a good idea. this will definetaly hurt people that want to venture about 0.0 alone or in a small group, let alone industrial ships."
"the excitement of that comes with the risk and reward of 0.0 space is diminished when there isn't anything out there to challenge you. there aren't going to be player gatecamps and roaming gangs all the time, and that can mean a person could go 20 jumps in 0.0 and never be challenged. as for traveling alone, some would say that is irresponsible in an industrial ship. i've always had someone scout ahead for me when i was moving precious cargo or in a slowly maneuvering ship.i want ccp to inject more challenges into the game and upgrading what the npc's can do would be a good way to do this. if they could program in a way for npc's to utilize stargates there could be convoys in lowsec or 0.0 which players could intercept. i see a lot of potential here."

"having known you for a long time promithius and knowing you are true to your word. you have my vote already.although what is your stance on the nano nerf?"
"this is why i think he is so cool.when i joined eve i was all alone not knowing what the hell i was doing.then one day i was jumping around amarr space when i got a window open to find it filled with ppl one of them being prom.he from then of had me under his wing and helped me grow in the game to this day.all in all he has a vast amount love for the game and the ppl he plays with and not only them but all in game.personal gain is a must in the game but he will sometimes put alot of effort in others even if it takes him of his planed path in game.so i say big up to the prom you are tops in my book m8 regardslickter"
"i believe that the up-coming nano nerf is yet another example of the lack of direct communication between ccp and the players. yes some balancing is necessary, we all know that nano has become the staple of roaming gangs and not re-balancing the mechanics would just let the situation get more and more out of hand. after i encountered a 45kps crow a few days ago i came to the realization that any ship able to go so fast that they are for all reasonable purposes invulnerable is not a good thing. however and this is a big one, i don't think that the way ccp are suggesting these changes are the best way to go about resolving the issue. the idea is clearly unpopular, almost everyone i have spoken to believes that its to harsh a change, and i am inclined to agree.so in short, i believe that the nano changes were made with good intention but very poorly executed with a distinct lack of listening to peoples opinions."
"i fully endorse the candidacy of promithius! we don't always see eye to eye, but he has always been reasonable to deal with and i have found him to be someone who doesn't make important decisions until he has canvassed all the facts. a rare quality in someone with such murderous skills and hardware! prom is also someone who is not on my buddy list! why? because he is my friend!i would recommend you vote for prom if you want a strong leader who has the \"kahunas\" to stand up and be counted!good luck prom!"

"well lets see, i was wondering how to express why i thought promithius would make a good csm and while having a conversation with friends i described him to a alliance mate in a flipped way then realized it was accurate.promithius in this conversation was described by me as cliffs notes.defined: cliffsnotes (formerly cliffs notes, and often, incorrectly, cliffnotes) are a series of student study guides available primarily in the united states. the guides present and explain literary and other works in pamphlet form or online. endorsers say the guides help readers understand complex works, while detractors say they let students avoid even reading them.my definition as it pertains to promknowledgeable, insightful, articulate and accurate. i use this term to describe prom because all that have met him (at first glance) see him as arrogant and having somewhat of a god complex.truth be told once you get to know him and the residents of eve you understand how this can happen. among the sea of noobs, nerds, blood thirsty pirates and pea sized brain cell players sits promithius.always willing to assist those who are willing to answer but throwing the chaff to the wind to separate it from the wheat of the field. his abrasive side soon becomes warm after he has discerned your intent and adequate ability to communicate and think rationally.he is a abundant source of information and ideas and willing to go the extra yard for those that truly wish to excel in eve as opposed to exist. i was and am still amazed by his answers (hence the description)when asked a question prom gives you a clear, plain, articulate and brief synopsis of the concept its practicality and chance of success or failure. and to my amazement 99% of the time even the cerebrally challenged grasp the meaning and information easily and completely. in summation i would have to say prom would make a awesome csm simply based on his ability to communicate unilaterally, clearly and informatively on a personal note he cares for the game and the people that play it... and when he says:you can take that to the bank ! the promithius i know never makes statements like that unless he means it and never goes half way and turns around. he has my vote just based on his dedication alone, his personality and abilities are just icing on the cake.if you dont know prom personally do yourself a favor and get to know him and enhance your game and personal experience in eve.texaswarlordexecutor: north domain defense forces alliance"

"its difficult to rant about only 2 things :), but if pushed i would speak about the old gtc issue and how in my mind and the minds of those i regularly speak to, it has never been resolved. as far as we can see all this has served to do is increase the price of plying eve , it has also artificially pushed up the price for gtc's with isk, given that before when you had 30 day and 90 , the price of the 30 days put a limit on how much you could charge for the 90's , now we are up as much as 500+ mil, which is more than we used to pay for 90.secondly i would want to raise the issue of the petition system, as im sure all of you have experienced the time honored tradition of the \"copy paste response\". the system makes the players feel disjointed and as if they are not really being listened to, some small changes could help make the system feel a little more player oriented, im not entirely sure what those changes might be right now , i have some ideas but that would be the point i would raise."
"you got my vote prom! best of luck mate"
"thanks for all your support guys and gals , seeing so many of you say such nice things about me makes me think perhaps you are mistaking me for someone else i hope i can live up to the high expectations you all have of me."
"where do i begin?after joining prom and his corp. i realised this was a person that knew what they were doing.not only that, he knew how to order things properly.if something needed doing prom has always been a person that could step up to the task. when decisions needed to be made, he judged accordingly. not allowing favouritism to come in the way of fairness.after seeing many of the hard choices that needed to be made, this is a person that defiantly puts others before himself.i think that prom would be a perfect csm candidate.+ 1 votekeep up the good work prom"

(who knows i might get killed for being a csm member)5. me and my campaign team will take in game and out of game efforts to try and get pixel sonurscreen elected for the csm. for this to work out, my corporation: pixels docks[pixed] is recruiting and taking campaign funds donations. blanc donations to the corporation as well as private donations will be considered campaign funds donations. check out corporation information in game if u are interested.this information is regarding the csm candidate pixel sonurscreen election campaign agenda. offered to the electorate, opponent candidates and other involved parties. for questions or contacts check pixels docks[pixed] corporate information for options.with best regards,pixel sonurscreenruud faasenthe netherlands"

"i'm a big fan of this game, and have been playing it since 2005. my motivation for being elected to the csm is to help ensure that eve-online continues to be a great game to play and that too many changes aren't made too quickly.for the most part, my character tends to stay clear of 0.0 space, prefering low-sec space. i'm a proud mission-*****. :-)i do have a few pet-peeves on some aspects of the game that you may agree or disagree with ... let me know your views. ghost training - it's about time they closed this loophole - not allowing people to \"play\" without paying strikes me as common sense. new player skill points - i'd like to slow down the trend that has new players starting with sooo many more skill points compared to what a new player a couple years ago started out with ... being able to fly a cruiser should be earned. station humpers - really, how much fun is it to sit outside a station playing games to gank a ship ... macro-haulers/macro-miners - i'd love to see less of this ... questions for me?thanks!"

"hey voters and candidates!am curious to know if i understand the the role/purpose of the csm council before casting my vote.responsibility; - analyzing and voting on every idea or suggestion brought up by eve players (and csm members themselves) on the assembly hall forum.- taking all accepted ideas/suggestions to ccp for the iceland meeting.- informing the eve community on the progress of the ideas/suggestions brought to the attention of ccp.i believe that being a csm member is alot of work and effort. these few lines may not reveal everything you do but isn<U+FFFD>t this essentially what the council does? basicly, taking ideas from the community that csm think are good and taking them to ccp?"
"well that is indeed the exterior of the csm, but there also is an interior part, where we answer our truckloads of emails, set up ingame discussions, and work out documentation.\"taking all accepted ideas (...)\" doesn't cut it, as all the threads that you want to support as csm have to be distilled into a document that ccp can use. as a csm you also have to present your issues to the council, answer questions from your peers, and if necessary, modify your document based on feedback from them. likewise, a csm has to do the same for the other council members, reading their documents and asking questions, before you actually get to the voting part.if you do not put much effort into your documents, the whole issue is likely to get shot down until you fix it, so you do have quite a bit of responsibility when it comes to representing the players.personally i'm in contact with quite a few people that do not want to post on the forums for whatever reason. i have to work out their issues and encourage them to post it, or add their input to overall ideas and post those myself."

"first of all, the removal of 'ghost' training didn't affect me at all. i do however have an observation which i would like to make. the main justification which ccp provided for banning this form of training is the fact that players could train skills wihtout paying a subscription (a kinda of 'bug'); ccp concluded that this is unfair on them as a company as well as on other players who pay the subjscription. i therefore see 'lack of subscription' as the main problem with ghost training.without getting into whether these reasons are valid or not, i do believe that these same arguments should therefore support the idea of skill queue; since the lack of 'subscription' was the main problem with ghost training, i can't therefore see any problem, in principle, with skill queue as long as there is an active subscription. i do recall one argument against skill queue; ccp didn't want people to simply set a long queue without contributing to the game and its economics. while this can be easily addressed by setting limits, i also believe that as long as an individual 'pays' for a subscription, it should be up to him / her to decide if and when they log on. in any case, in an economically driven real world we all live in, i really doubt people will be willing to pay subscriptions without getting anything in return. but we need to keep in mind that sometimes, we have to focus on rl issues and it might not always be possible for us to monitor skill progress and log on to avoid losing training time (which equates to real life money after all and not in game isk); this could get more complicated when people own multiple accounts.edit: in conclusion, i am therefore in favour of skill queue 2nd edit: checked support rt"

"yeap,i agree.."

"as someone who's laptop likes to make me nuke the eve cache every few weeks, /signed. this is one of those, \"why hasn't anyone else thought of this,\" kind of ideas."
"down with the nano nerf."
"skill training queue needs to be in this game. especially after removing ghost training. if the logic is to not let people not paying train, then it would also make sense to let paying people train always!"
"not having skill queue does not promote playing the game, merely causes a lot of frustrations especially now after you removed ghost training which could be used to make up for whatever training time you lost due to rl. so full support for skill queue of some kind."
"my only complaint is the inability to drag secure cargo cans around.: o pi'm sure everyone has the \"well duh\" answer as to why so don't bother telling me.just saying... that's one of the things i frown at ^_^"
"first of all, this is not a thread to discuss skill queues. there's already one thread for that issue. there's even another one created when ghost training got nerfed to demand the same thing.this thread is about fighting a well rooted idea in the minds of the developers that not having a skill queue promotes playing eve more. from my point of view, it does not.i have a life. i need to spend at least 9 hours working, and more time out of my home if you count the time i spend on transports and doing other duties.unluckily, some of the skills at some levels (namely level 2, 3 and 4) have shorter training times than the time i spend at work and longer than the time i can spend daily playing this game without compromising my personal life.i have a home and a son. i need to take care of both and thus my time playing eve daily is limited. while it still leaves the weekend free to play more, i can't be all weekend pending from a game. i need to have some time for me and my son, so i can't be every 3-4 hours returning to my pc just to change a dumb skill.not having a skill queue doesn't change the time i can devote to the game at all. it only makes my eve experience more complicated. and makes me feel like i have a handicap compared to other players with more free time to play.so, if you still think that i'll play less by having a skill queue, in my case, you are totally wrong.i'm tired of hearing this idea over and over from the developers. it really hurts me and my relationship with the game and ccp suffers every time i read it.so, please, make it clear: in my opinion you are totally wrong by believing it. a skill queue will be a positive thing for all of us. and right now there's no technical reason for not implementing it. as for what kind of skill queue i'd like to see implemented i urge you to read the appropiate thread, where there are many different ideas, with it's pros and cons.other players may have their own reasons for liking a skill queue. these are mine.if you (player) too believe that the devs idea that not having a skill queue promotes playing eve more is wrong, please, give your support to this thread and express your case.thanks for reading."
"i agree fully, but the assembly hall is the wrong place for this thread, unless your goal is to have the csm advance a position of general disagreement with ccp with no actual new proposals in it. that really isn't something the csm can vote for."
"my skill training schedule is totally different from my eve playing schedule, because like most people, i have a life outside eve.give us a skill queue.signed."
"100% agreed."
"i don't see anything new with your argument here, nor have i seen anyone even attempt to refute it."
"well, tbh, i thought that one of the duties of the cms was letting the worries of players be heard by the devs.previously the cms talked with ccp about skill queues, and this is what we got:as a result, some priorities were assigned to the issues presented by the csm, like this:i, like many other people, felt that a medium-high priority for this issue was not good enough.but i waited for some kind of answer to this, because i thought that maybe there were other issues that prevented a decision about this subject.fast forward to some days ago. the ghost training nerf came, and many people who were waiting for an answer to the skill queue problem knew that now there where no other technical issues preventing a skill queue, so a thread about the subject appeared.but then, yesterday i read this:the same old song about \"no skill queue encourages playing eve\" again. we were again back at square 1...[continues...]"
"so i took the opportunity given to ask zulupark again about this, since i'm clearly missing something here:and this is wat i got:so, i really hope ccp hammer can explain this, because no matter how i look at that statement, i really don't get it, so i must be missing something.i'm not really trying to force anything here, i just want to know why they keep saying something i don't understand (and that i don't agree with or makes no sense at all to me.) i must be missing something here, and i would really like them to explain it to me. skill queue or not.i know you are a csm candidate, and i hope you will be sensible to other players worries. specially one that looks rather demanded by us. besides, this is the only forum with some kind of voting capability, so i considered that and issue that in my view must be addressed by the csm and that need some sort of support by other players fitted this forum nicely. sorry if i was wrong about it.regards."

"i'm in favor of this.anyway, let me get it straight and sum up the issues please.1) web nerf reduces blaster damage due to tracking, or causes blaster ships being unable to hit most of the time2) web nerf makes it more difficult for a blaster ship to remain in range3) speed reduction increases time it takes to get in range4) blaster dps gets approached by torps and lasers, which have a much larger range, putting blasters at a disadvantageanything else?"
"1. yes, 90% webs covered up the problem of large blasters not being able to hit anything inside their own optimal range unless it was held perfectly still.2. correct, the web nerf, particularly in conjunction with the 2pt scram turning off mwds, has made it very difficult to maintain range, as well as keep the target from escaping by making it back to the gate/dock range and jumping out. secondly, other 'solutions' such as fitting dual webs or a web and a disruptor *and* a 2pt scram are only viable on ships with 5x mids and additionally take away those ships' existing versatility by *requiring* the extra tackle gear.3. the speed reduction increases the time required to cover the same distance, requires that more total distance be covered (this is very important when trying to tackle a ship trying to get back into dock/jump range) and also consumes a ton more cap. this is critical as you don't want to be completely out of cap/cap charges when you finally arrive at your required range.4. due to a long list of changes (resist changes, t2 ammo nerfs, torp rof buffs, ability to tune damage type to weakest resists, etc.) other weapons are able to equal or **surpass** blaster dps at most common combat ranges, and definitely at anything over 8-10km. when targets are within blaster optimal other weapons (lasers, torps) have equal or greater on-target dps than blasters, and blasters are supposed to be unequaled in their damage output, by a large margin.if you have any specific questions or need exact details about blaster ships, their fitting, how to fly them, etc. please feel free to ask/contact me here or in game.thanks in advance."
"i support this thread. blasterships need to be looked at."
"i think ccp decided at one point and said:hey look, we got the majority of players using caldari ships lets boost caldari and nerf the rest so the majority is happyseriously i dont understand why missiles get boosted every patch while turrets get hit by the nerf bat with each. i wish my blasters would use 0 cap and hit from over 50km, while doing 1k+ dpsedit: thumbs up for this one ofc"

"fueling sounds fine. the only other limitation this thing needs to be found is a very small cloaking radius. a small group of us have used gscs like this in the past, and it's amazingly how easily we've been probed out at them several times, despite only being uncloaked near them for several seconds.a determined enemy will be able to easily capitalize on mistakes such as ships drifting outside the field, or momentary disruptions in the cloak that might happen when a new ship enters it or when too much ship mass is present inside it. perhaps allow probes to narrow it to within snoop range (5au) while it's cloaked, so that it is possible to pick up ships when (not if) they make these mistakes.a lazy enemy should not be handed their locations on a silver platter at x interval just because they have sov level y. just as the anchoring corp/alliance should have to work a bit to keep them running, you should have to work a bit and exercise a bit of patience and thought to find them.carrier-level capacity with no sma seems balanced, as does the ability to refit. gsc capacity is rather small, and would be filled by any normal successful pvp operations within a day or two. remember that this is a game, and requiring fueling interactions on a 24hr basis would be unrealistic and make them too vulnerable. sometimes people don't play absolutely every single day. 3-4 days is a realistic fueling timeframe.alliance-wide covert cyno beacon is an excellent idea, and would let a determined small group set up a network of these in enemy space to quickly move around with black ops.one question i'm not sure about is accessibility; making their location knowable by anyone in the alliance seems like it might limit their usefulness, given how easy it is to simply get a spy character into most alliances. on the other hand, being only accessible by bookmark doesn't sound so great either. maybe link their visibility on the solar system map to corp roles?"
"or maybe another way to go about it, is it to make it a module that can only be fit by a blackops bs. you hit the module, and 10 minutes later your bs is transformed into this pirate base and your pod is ejected. anyone with the skill to activate the module can re-enter and turn off the module. give it a cycle time of a couple of days so you still have interaction, with some small volume, high expense fuel that powers it. i like the idea of the base itself not being probable. but as ships \"dock\" with it, it's scan res goes up. doing it this way gives the enemy who's space you are in the oportunity of probing out and stealing the ships/material, instead of just blowing it up."
"how about simply making it impossible to deploy them if your alliance has sov (any level) in that system. and make them only accessible to the alliance that placed it, so that you couldn't use a \"fake neutral\" corp to place it in your own space."
"similar idea :"
"let me preface this. fueling poss sucks. srsly. it's a black hole that eats time and isk better spent elsewhere, having fun. with that, i had an idea on balancing fueling vs the infinite unbalanced utility of such a thing. give it a tiny fuel bay, that could be easily, cheaply filled by something like a black ops or two. the fuel would power a \"long range sensor dampening / cloaking field\" for 30 days of dormancy. while dormant it'd be insanely hard to probe out (not impossible though), and be a visual shimmer / distortion, similar to a cloaked ship, but bigger. maybe make it completely un-probable 55 minutes out of an hour; it'd be a \"sensor anomaly\" that appears and disappears at random.to use it, you'd fly up to it, switch it to an \"active mode\" and it's fuel requirements would increase tenfold. when active, you can access whatever services the thing provides and it'll cloak any small ships within a 5km bubble or so. hell, instead of 10x fuel costs, tie the increased fuel needs while active to the amount of mass it has to cloak. give the transition from dormant to active a one to five minute warm up time too, so the quick and the smart could probe you out, and the slow, stupid, or lazy get caught trying to abuse this thing.if kept fairly cheap and disposable, this would give small operations a means to survive in deep space by stealth rather than raw force of arms, or give larger groups more options for outposts.one other thing of note, making something that's only discoverable / killable by metagaming means is not only a bad precedent to set, but very unhealthy for any game."

"i went through the index pages and didn't find anything on this.it is a simple request - don't set a m3 limit to coureier contracts. i cannot see what is the use of limiting courier contracts to 120k m3 as the cargo space set for ships will automatically control this; when setting up a contract, people will keep in mind that the smaller the volume of a single contract is, the more characters are capable to haul the package and it is therefore more likely to be completed quickly. on the otherhand, setting a courier contract of 1.5 million m3 is basilcally useless as no ship can accomodate such volume (as far as i know)rt"
"we tried to persuade ccp to remove it at the iceland meeting.however, i believe there was some database issues."

"yes, please."
"yeah, i can support that.we need ccp to look into that."
"what sort of issues? is there any reason the limit couldn't be set to, say, 981,250 m3? (the maximum capacity of any cargo hold)also, i like the bit about optimization of moving ships in courier contracts. that can be a truly ugly process, and it'd be good to have streamlining exist for it."
"i like this idea, generally speaking -- so it's just a matter of working out the specifics. here are a couple of ideas:first, in order to avoid the situation that exists with moon mining, lets make control of the assets more dynamic. this can't be done militarily, but it can be done economically: control is given to the highest bidder, with auctions weekly to determine control for the next week. positive side-effects include dynamically raising the cost of assets producing items that prove to be high-value.second, add in the ability for (hostile) players to impact production. remember all those npc trade ships that fly back and forth between stations? well, some of them are carrying your stuff from the planet to your office in the station. if a pirate or hostile corporation catches one of the transports (which will fly the owners flags, and count as belonging to the owning corp for purposes of concord and/or wars), they can destroy or capture a portion of your production. make it so these transports run once per day, carry a day's worth of product, and run at a time specified by the owner at least a day in advance."
"you shouldn't have picked achura.if you don't like it, biomass your char."
"so you would suggest that people delete characters that are several years old because the avatar they get with ambulation isn't one they like ?even when they had no idea that ambulation was even going to exist when they made their character ?even when the only reason they don't like the avatar is because of decisions ccp made after they created the character ?if this was about character portraits you would have a point because all the information about the appearance was there in the character creation menu. but even now we don't know what limitations our avatars will have. so how do you know that you won't hate your available avatar options when ambulation is released ?how will you feel if you find that achura's get all the good looking avatars while your stuck with the ugly ones ?will you be willing to delete your main character if that happens ?"
"no, because i think ambulation is a gimmick."
"no if anything make ambulation not mandatory some of us dont want to see anything but ships... no peoples!"
"actually it'd be nice if we are able to spruce up our wardrobe when ambulation hits. for those whacky rp'ers who do things like play caldari achura ex-pats who want to dress like a foppish gallente.\"plastic surgery\" should be right out. maybe they should let you muck with your face decorations, get a new piercing, but that's the most. you choose that face when ya started, even if it's a face only a mother could love, that's more than most people get.qft, this is irrelevent. this is internet spaceships, not world of world of warcraft..."
"wow elf lover spotted"
"op has my sympathy, i think everyone should get to redo the character appearance screen (note: not pick new bloodline or w/e), as i for one want to put a hood over my ugly mush, before venturing out in public ."
"vote.fuggly achuras :("
"i'm a sexy beast, the ladies love me and i can't wait for ambulation. too bad you picked an achura male. /not signed."
"how do you know that your characters body structure will look better than mine when all you have gotten to see so far is your characters face ?so you would prefer that everyone is stuck with a decision they made based before they knew about ambulation, even when you could be screwed over by changes that ccp decide to make later ?which would serve you better:1 - limiting everyones choice of avatars to ones from your current bloodline and/or gender.2 - letting everyone change their characters bloodline and gender once, then forcing the limitation on them.especially when the initial creation of our avatars will involve a lot of customisation."
"i like the basic idea of making the construction skills more meaningful, but i think that a time reduction has a fairly low effect on most t1 producers, and a sizeable boost to t2 producers. since t2 production already requires the skills to be trained, it results in up to 33% improvement in profit/time for t2 producers.instead, i'd propose a small reduction in material cost for production; perhaps around a half percent, maybe a full percent per level. this would have a fairly negligible impact on market prices, overall, and would offer little benefit to traditionally high-profit production fields. but for the more competitive fields (such as t1 ship production), it would give a noticable benefit to dedicated producers over casual builders.for example, if an item can normally be sold at a 10% profit, decreasing build costs by 2.5% (at level 5) would increase profit margins by 25%, less a slight reduction due to competition driving the market price down.(edit to add support)"

"i think i just lost 2 minutes of my life.can i have my 2 minutes back?"
"the basic argument is always the same: because there are three slots, ccp must enable simultaneous training. what will be next: simultaneous training for jump clones - just because they are there?!i am not even sure whether there are valid pro and con arguments at all in this discussion. the game is such by design. think about it this way: you put your soul into a character slot. hence, only one is active. the other one is in stasis. maybe the word game is wrong in this context to start with. this is virtual reality!multi-payers get multi accounts? ok, true. advantage/disadvantage of the char market? now, if you want to play this game, then play it from the beginning. bringing the char market into a discussion which is supposed to be taken serious is a ... adversarial move. who wants to buy a char anyway?!"
"partially agree.i would be happy to pay a little more to train at least one of the 2 remaining characters at half speed.or with something like:14.95 train 1st character at full speed.22.45 train 1st character at full speed and a second at 1/2 speed.29.90 train 1st character at full speed and the other 2 at half speed."
"i support this. but it needs more limitations. a noob buying a battleship after 14 days for lent money, while not having any ways of generating this back will be unwanted. but as always: eve is a sci-fi mmo with prehistoric technology :p"
"i was really hesitant when it looked like it was going to cost the 1bil in skill books the rorq did when you made it a capital.it looks to be a dream ship. since it is a joint developement will both ore and deep core sell the bpo so it won't require going to 0.0 to pick up a bp?just about perfect to me."

"issler dainze - csm candidate - \"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"i thought i'd take a moment to talk about how i think the csm needs to conduct itself and what the csm should attempt to accomplish.first, the council needs to conduct its business in a mature and orderly manner. meetings need to be managed professionally and with some sort of rules of order. members that choose to be disruptive, disrespectful or unable to operate under those rules of order should be subject to escalating sanctions from the csm directly. i don't expect this to be a problem but i have been involved in enough groups to know that sometimes keeping activities focused and productive can be a challenge.the council must agree to operate with complete transparency. meetings minutes should be available to all eve pilots without edit or censor.a process should be put in place that allows the eve pilots to raise issues for consideration by the csm. the process should allow the pilots to see the current status of any issue formally raised for consideration by the csm. if votes are involved the votes of each csm member should be made availble for all eve pilots to review. if an issue is dismissed at some point in the process the dismissal should be made public with the ultimate justification of the actions. if the csm decides to pursue the issue the pilots of eve should be made aware of the csm's intentions for further action. whenever possible (within the limits of ccp emposed ndas) the csm should attempt to make ccps reactions to recomendations clear to the the pilots of eve.csm members must be accountable. i would propose that once an issue has been raised to the csm by the pilots of eve that it is given an owner within the csm. this csm member will be responsible for sheparding the issue though the process. the csm member would be expected to become the \"expert\" for the issue within the csm. they would become the primary contact point for the csm with regards to the issue.the csm must demonstrate sensitivity to the issues facing ccp as well. it is not acceptable to just say something is wrong and demand it be fixed. the csm must also provide suggestions for how issues might be resolved based in the council's discussions as well as feedback provided by the pilots of eve. the csm should only present an issue to ccp when it has been thoroughly investigated and it is well understood by the csm. the csm's effectiveness will be dramatically improved if they prove to be credible to ccp. there is a terribly overused term in my professional life that i will use here. the csm must \"add value\" to the process of providing eve pilot feedback to ccp.finally, the csm needs to keep in mind, this is all supposed to be \"fun\". that's not to say that you can't be serious about your \"fun\", but that it needs to not become combative, personal or so involved that no one can possibly suceed. i'd also hope everyone in the csm approaches their involvement with the best intentions. the csm cannot be allowed to become a \"metagaming\" element in eve.so i hope that helps everyone get a sense of what i think the practicalities of the csm should be like.enough for now and remember..stuffs getting better! stuffs getting better everyday! issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakastu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord"
"you got my votes last time, i think you'll get them again.what's your analysis of the first csm?what do you think you could have done differently?"
"thank you.a lot of what the first csm did isn't going to be apparent due to both the nda and the design cycle that ccp works with, so its hard to say. they had a lot of problems early dealing dealing with a lack of organization and a few people who didn't feel like adjudicating the rules fair and evenly. that, and the animosity it created, clouded the rest of the session.but even then, it seems that a number of decent things got sent to cccp and a number of very bad things got shot down. however, whatever the final tally is, i will reserve my judgment for when ccp releases any information.get elected ;)edit:actually, i have something to say regarding part of that. over on shc there was a lot of talk about ccp's design cycle and how that impacts small balance changes. i would push for ccp to create a team directly responsible for understanding and making small changes that don't require over-all approval.e.g. locus rigs not stacking properly was a bug that had persisted for nearly a year after its discovery. there is no reason that that should have taken a year to get fixed. another example is the shield/armor hit points of the typhoon. the phoon should have more armor than shield, its an armor tanker. changing that doesn't require a 6 month design cycle, it requires someone to be in charge of fixing small things with the gumption to make sure it gets done."
"hello allas said in my application text, i am a simple pragmatic person. i candidate to push as hard as as i can for the existing features to work as intended, by pushing on important subjects the community feels.csm goal in my opinion should is to try to give proper feedback from the community and act as an 'idea farm'. not to sit in whatever pixelated glory.my goal is to help as much as i can to make eve a better game with the current features it is supposed to provide.the current main issues i see per subject, that'll be my wall of text for now :p0.0 : server infrastructure can not hold the fleets.blob warfare should not be the end of it all. there are a lot of ideas around to overcome this.find a way to promote small non-nano warfare, instead of the current blob-fest fleet battles. blast damage, for example, is one of the ideas that's on many threads. there are others.all those ideas are over forum are bring good debates each time.general pvp : pvp happens in too few locations. gates, poses, stations. there again are a lot of ideas around to promote a less centralized pvp fields.0.0 market : make market a station service like it is supposed to be, add more filters. unlike what it is now. a neutral in space should require market access to buy things. contract mechanics do not have the flexibility of market.industry : outpost industry is now pointless. taking over an outpost is way faster than building it.npc seeded market breaks the idea of an open player driven market.related to corp industry : create mechanism that make it easy for people to contribute to a corp production chain (which right now requires too much out of game tools)out of game : hire a damn webmaster, make a script to prevent npc alts to post on caod. edit : apparently this is a solved issue now, i didnt check.out of game : checking account alts is easy via api keys. a lot of corporations and groups are then relying on out of the game tools to ensure their corp security. this should be included ingame directly. basically let directors see your alts.corporation management : the tools provided to directors are way too limited. unlimited divisional wallets. this area should be totally revamped its close to unusable.devs/ccp/community interaction : there is a real lack of live events. many small to middle sized events could be organized even by isd, to make the space less mechanic and more \"alive\".basically the goal is to be biting ccp's bottom, with all due respect ofc, by pointing right where the game does not work as intended. once a subject is covered, move to the next.the community decides what means \"works as intended\", that's part of a sandbox definition right? :pthanks for readingsplag"

"1. what is your view on this topic?linkage2. what is your view on the dd?"
"1. the poster for minmatar capitals make some valid points but makes some invalid ones as well.he assumes that minmatar capitals must shield tank and basis his assumptions on that thesis. however that thesis is not wholeheartedly necessary. minmatar capitals can armor tank and almost all standard fleet dreadnaughts do just that because of the limitations that he lists. to stop that limitation and allow the versatility that minmatar capital pilots train for, i would suggest we adopt his recommendations for addition cpu, i would also agree that the hardpoint slots would be done for a change. 3/3 personally would seem to me to be a much more interesting pitch with still split damage bonuses to prevent it from being overpowered.slotwise you cannot grant \"extra\" slots without overpowering a ship so, if he wants to extra mids in favor of a lost high and low slot then i could agree with that, but not with a positive slot gain. however i dont like it. i personally think it would just create a pheonix copy with projectile weapons however.the solution i think would work best is a low slot traded for a midslot 3/3 turret/missile hardpoints. the naglfar's projectile bonuses reduced to 5% and a 10% increase in shield and a 10% decrease in armor. accompained by a large cpu boost.as to the nidhoggur, cpu, yes (although this means you must boost the chimera as well) then as well, at most you can boost the nidhoggur's capacitor by 5%.improving the bonus? no. it's already a useful bonus when used.i read through the thread and while alot of pilots seem in favour of it, it does not work well for overall game balance to drastically improve one carrier without doing so to the others. so a pair of minor upgrades i can agree with, but others? no2. its overpowered and overused. titan's as i watch every day dictate the combat we engage in on or off the field. i'm not sure what the exact solution is but there is definetly something wrong"

"they prefer the term \"third party supporters\". point conceded however.when i stated that i appeared to be doing it wrong i did not mean to imply that my policy on in game story moving to punish the caldari for their actions both in the novel and chronicles is not without merit however, i merely noticed after browsing the other candidates that most if not all had presented personal policies and statements of intent and felt that if anyone at all was to going to take my running in the election as anything other than a joke i needed to clarify that i do indeed have (in my own eyes at least) some merit as a candidatei could extend that into a few paragraphs for the 'wall of text' vote but its a little early to be selling out just yet :)i wish you and all others running a good and possibly fun campaign.boosh"
"dear arithron, you spent several hours searching that cold dark system for my corpse, for that you will get my vote! anyone who wants to be a csm (dear god why the **** would anyone want to be a csm) as bad as arithron will do their best. i support this guy in his quest to be a csm. on top of that, he's not a *** like most of the other people he's going up against!... anyone who knows me knows that i am a real sourpuss, so when you hear a positive tone coming from me then you know it's good!arithron 2008!"
"absolutely - the generation of the raw resources would have to be kept up ...ccp couldn't get rid of macro-mining completely - but i would try to make it more difficult by putting some additional risks in the game to balance the reward being gained ... for example, lets say two people from different corps/fleets were mining the same 'roid when it got depleted - give the possibility of a 15 minute agro between the miners involved, perhaps based on the quantity/type of asteroid being mined ... another option might be to create npc-miners that do the mining (adding possible twists the npcs could perhaps be attacked given the the right set of circumstances?) and having the npc mined materials put up on the market ... i agree with your point on the impact of removing macro-mining - not many people enjoy mining for 12-hour stretches of time, but presently having that scale of mining going on is playing a key role in the manufacture of items ... are there many macro-miners here that could comment? i'd like to get another perspective."
"what? why is a mailing list bad for discussion? that strains credulity on the surface and you are a bright guy so i don't understand what i am missing here.thx."
"the problem is that a mailing list is hard to keep track of. the ability to quote and things like that is kinda hard.it's also easier for the public to keep track of discussion of a forum. the community is already used to reading the forum we have right here. we gotta bring the discussion right to the community, imo!does that make sense? edit: thanks to arithron for pointing out the error i made which made my whole post extremely contradicting."
"didn't you mean to say that it's much harder for the public to keep track of discussion via a mailing list?communication and discussion with players is of paramount importance for the csm. i'll be seeking alternate ways to engage the playerbase if i get onto the csm. one idea would be an listed in-game channel that shows in all regions etc called csm discussion or somesuch. csm members can thus interact with players and answer questions etc. of course, it will hinge on csm members using the channel, rather than closing the channel as happens now with the csm one (i often see csm logged or logging in, but not in channel).take care,arithron"

"just saw the full list of csm candidates, and something is obviously missing here. the \"enter\" key. i submitted a fairly short message, but it still looks kind of silly when you remove the line break halfway through. when you look at a message like arithron's, ankhasentapemkah's, or, god forbid, kesper north's, they're absolutely unreadable. i'd like to request that either ccp restore the formatting we submitted our messages with, or failing that, that they give us a chance to re-submit formatting for them(though without being allowed to change the content). it's painful enough for me to read, i don't want to think about being a voter who had never heard of these people being faced down by undifferentiated walls of text in several of these candidates' messages."
"there are some great possibilities that eve has in regard to improving the market-system ... what would be especially interesting to me would be a cause-and-effect relationship with some of the set npc trading ... for example, all those construction blocks going from point a to point b should at some point in time result in some effect ... thoughts?"
"geez - wrong forum ... to quote one of the other candidates ... \"i guess i'm doing it wrong ... \""
"although wait. lets stop and turn this into something. a electorial debate of the effects of 'govermental intervention' (the csm/devs) in the free marketplace and proposed stances and positions.you say there are \"some great possibilities that eve has in regard to improving the market-system\" but should 'improvements' even be made in a marketplace that consists of players trading with each other. surely any 'improvment' is mearly an attempt at regulating that market imposing a possible impediment to free trade and slowing economic growth.should the possibilty even exist to introduce a non player driven effect within the market.canditdates! state your position!"
"i've always assumed the movement of npc goods was mostly to support an equilibrium in the economy - they're producing lego at a, and using it at b, so they'll pay you to move it. now if you wanted to have npc orders be more dynamic, i could get behind that, but with the long-term price changes already based on how often a particular order gets filled(or not), i think they have the core of the system down right."
"what i had in mind was something more along the lines of some \"effect\" occuring as a result of the sale of npc goods over time ... to use the construction block example, lets say a huge number of block have been purchased on a regular basis by an npc corp, how could that be reflected in the game - what i had in mind was perhaps a \"special complex\" would show up in system - or perhaps some \"special items/ships\" would become available from the loyalty point store. there are surely other ideas on what kind of effects would make sense. thoughts?the aspect that i personally think would be cool is that trading (or even lack of trading?) would have some sort of impact on another aspect of the game.quite a bit of thought would be needed in implementing something like this - i mean what is the result of a npc corp buying massive amounts of some of the colorful eve-items on the market (for example, spirits, tobacco, garbage ...) over time?"
"a lot of them really aren't used on anything like that kind of scale. why would it be represented in-game that the npc ceo of an npc corporation is having a good week with his cigar suppliers? spaceships aren't built out of construction blocks or exotic dancers, they're built out of minerals. if any of the trade goods were actually used for player purposes, they wouldn't be trade goods, they'd be player-sourced (with the exception of pos fuel and outpost components). also, the design time for what you propose would be pretty horrifying - designing a new, widely-available ship requires a lot of design and balance work, and designing as many as you'd need for this initiative to actually work sensibly would take more man-hours than ccp could conceivably put towards this. this area of the economy really isn't broken - not everything in the eve universe is done by or for pod pilots - i see no need to fix it."
"wow as a candidate i have to say a read alot of good things about promithius. and i say good luck if you do win. we will have a very helpful csm. right on prom."

"ghost training always was a big annoyance to me as i felt like peeps that did it were cheating on me. it promotes offline \"gaming\" and made characters a form of commodity to trade around that were build using free time. it removes the eve experience of growing up and adapting all the way.ghost training dead.... - good for every real eve player out there!do not even think of trying to counter this change. there will be more players helped by discontinuing it then hurt."
"yes. obv."

"i'd be more than happy with a two-skill queue (that is, primary and secondary). that way i could train one 'inconvenient length' skill per day, while working on a long skill. for example, i could train a 6-hour skill backed by a three-week skill without having to wake up early to switch the skill before work."
"a queue suggests that we want different skills lined up in a queue so a player can get away for weeks at an end and still get his training done. this suggestion is incomplete, misleading even, a queue can also be implicit for level 1-4 skills and apply only to the skill being trained. that way people don't have to stay up loosing sleep just to micromanage level1 -> level 2 -> level 3 -> level 4 transitions of a skill.this is the major grief of not having a skill queue, eve skill training dictating your life and body clock in order of not loosing in-game ability. the real change that is needed that will not be exploitable and will not add complexity to the game, but only a few lines of code is this:on skill training complete:if ( level achieved < 4 ) thenstart training next level of the skill.that is all!if ccp finds this too much, we can follow a scheme like:on skill training complete:if ( level achieved < 5 ) then start 48h timer and auto assume player wants to start training on the next level of the skillon logon: wipe timer and stay trainingon reaching 48h without logon abort training of skill, player did not explicitly started it, nor implicitly approved it by logging on.elegance all over it...it does solve the chores of changing skills (always a plus). worst thing that can happen to a player is that staining on the next level started while you might not have wanted it, resulting in some unused skill points. which is btw easily avoidable for people that log on regularly.so ccp, no drawbacks....now get those hamsters to start working please! why do i have to do all the thinking here!"

"here's all i want for xmas ccp... a very simple request.please allow me a simple 24 hour window to queue up my next desired skill.this would be so great because while i play a little throughout the week, my work schedule often conflicts with optimal login time. a simple 24 hour window to queue my next skill would make training so much more satisfying when i can't plan training to always end in the evening."
"yes please."
"please ccp make this dream come true"
"sounds like a good idea."
"i would have agreed if this was voting. it is not, it is merely a request for confirmation that there is a certain number of people who think the issue is important enough for the csm to discuss it.i think a sizeable minority should be able to bring questions to the table, that's why i will not support this."
"againstnano-nerf is fail"
"used to be for it, but its gone too far. do not nerf blasters. if ccp can't do this without making blasters even worse, they shouldn't do it."
"i currently have 6 skills with 4-6 hours of training needed to either get to level 4 or level 5 that would have been trained 2 weeks ago if their was a skill queue."
"a queue suggests that we want different skills lined up in a queue so a player can get away for weeks at an end and still get his training done. this suggestion is incomplete, misleading even, a queue can also be implicit for level 1-4 skills and apply only to the skill being trained. that way people don't have to stay up loosing sleep just to micromanage level1 -> level 2 -> level 3 -> level 4 transitions of a skill.this is the major grief of not having a skill queue, eve skill training dictating your life and body clock in order of not loosing in-game ability. the real change that is needed that will not be exploitable and will not add complexity to the game, but only a few lines of code is this:on skill training complete:if ( level achieved < 4 ) thenstart training next level of the skill.that is all!if ccp finds this too much, we can follow a scheme like:on skill training complete:if ( level achieved < 5 ) then start 48h timer and auto assume player wants to start training on the next level of the skillon logon: wipe timer and keep trainingon reaching 48h without logon: abort training of skill, player did not explicitly started it, nor implicitly approved it by logging on.elegance all over it...it does solve the chores of changing skills (always a plus). worst thing that can happen to a player is that staining on the next level started while you might not have wanted it, resulting in some unused skill points. which is btw easily avoidable for people that log on regularly.so ccp, no drawbacks....now get those hamsters to start working please! why do i have to do all the thinking here!"
"i am paying for my account. if i can't log in for a week (lots of military people have this problem and account sharing is an eula violation) as long as the subrscription is current they should allow skills to be trained. now after the last skill i set is active they would just cancel subscription.i would likely never go more than a couple days because i would miss my in-game freinds and need to baby sit the market orders but that is a valid reason to log in."
"thats all good and fine but you really should be posting this in jita park... not here.i also don't see a reason to state the obvious.assembly hall is a place to state ideas... not rants. (cough-coughghosttrainingwhinerscough-cough)"
"i think this is a veery good point, even if posted in the wrong forum .i believe there is some discussion about maybe having the skill queue issue raised again. if it does, i will make sure that this point is included."
"completely agree. obviously."
"\"having no skill queue encourgages people to log in and play.\" is a ridiculous idea. anyone with a modicum of common sense can see that.what i think ccp might actually mean when they say that is \"no skill queue discourages people from running multiple accounts purely to raise characters they're not going to play.\" regardless, i don't see that this is a good enough reason to inconvinience the rest of us, nor is it even necessarily desirable to do so."
"exacty the point i'm trying to make, and the reason why i'm pushing for a skill queue again even after ccp kinda dismissed it.as if i somehow want to play eve at 4 in the morning... *comes home*brother: \"heya, want a drink?\"me: \"yeah in a few minutes, my skill ended training 15 minutes ago but my buss was late blahblah\"*rushes upstairs to set another skill*really good gaming experience eh?"
"i agree with the op, but there is more, so read on!i understand ccp's argument against skill queues, but they are missing something. a queue suggests that we want different skills lined up in a queue so a player can get away for weeks at an end and still get his training done.this suggestion is incomplete, misleading even, a queue can also be implicit for level 1-4 skills and apply only to the skill being trained. that way people don't have to stay up loosing sleep just to micromanage level1 -> level 2 -> level 3 -> level 4 transitions of a skill.this is the major grief of not having a skill queue, eve skill training dictating your life and body clock in order of not loosing in-game ability. the real change that is needed that will not be exploitable and will not add complexity to the game, but only a few lines of code is this:on skill training complete: if ( level achieved < 4 ) then start training next level of the skill.that is all!no more, no less and you will end this discussion once and for all and everyone will be happy!"
"my opinion exactly. just because i log in to change a skill before i head to class, doesn't mean i suddenly change my mind after logging in and decide to spend 2 hours doing missions.people log in to play the game. switching skills is just a chore."

"+1when i took a break from eve - the first question i asked when i resubscribed was \"so when is the next pvp tourney?\""
"ofc support"
"supported . . . ive been looking for my chance in this for a long time"
"one adjustment would be to go through the ships that the database shows as your typical mwd blaster ships (thorax and megathron) and add bonuses to afterburners, tracking speed, and possibly stasis webs or max velocity. this is what i was hoping would happen to the thorax's mwd bonus as, from what i understand, ccp wants to see more afterburners used in combat."
"i wish to add that blasters need to be generally looked at. but, at the very least, now that webs will not be on/off weapons, they need to have their tracking increased so that blasterships have about the same chance to hit at their optimal engagement distance (say, optimal + falloff) like pulses and autocannons. just so that people can use their guns pretty much fairly. that would take, what? +50% tracking? doubling? whatever, yes they are that problematic.ah yes, found it. a heavy pulse laser has 16 km optimal + falloff and 0.08 tracking. a heavy neutron blaster has 8.600 km optimal + falloff and 0.10 tracking. it should be more like 0.08 tracking for pulse, 0.16 tracking for blasters. and that's the bare minimum.and then the whole \"i can not approach fast enough so i die\" idea needs consideration. but blaster tracking should be way, way higher just because of their smaller range. otherwise they will simply not be usable without the web to freeze the target."
"i think this is a very interesting idea. perhaps one way to connect this to the small scale gangs idea is to make an explicit role for the black ops ship.perhaps the mini-structure could be cloaked as described, but for it to 'hide' vessels a black ops ship with a specialized gang module would be needed. such a set up could create another way to reveal the hidden ships (take out the black ops ship) rather than relaying only on meta-gaming."
"i like the idea of the invading armada as long as players can fight and have a chance of destroying the armada and looting salvage ect"
"that idea in the op would be too easily exploited. come on, man. you know how high sec pirates operate. do you really want to have to answer challenges from 30 kiddie pirates every 10 seconds?a simpler idea would be to just have a 4-digit randomly generated docking code that is flashed on your screen that you have to type in before you dock (in high-sec stations only). but the code will be in irregular print (stretched/warped numbers), similar to those seen on forums to prevent anonymous spamming. this would make it impossible for a bot to redock, effectively killing their income, granted they don't have a pos in the system.i really wouldn't mind punching in a code, if it meant i wouldn't have to compete with macro miners."
"they need to put some basic macro tools in the game and just get over it already. why would any sane person want to actively mine.\"oh god, too many people will log on and afk mine all day\"make the macro tools only work in low sec or zero zero and take all the premium grades of the ore types out of high sec."

"i was reading the thread on the upcoming orca, and was noticing the nerd rage over it requiring mining barge v when it isn't even really a mining vessel, it's an over glorified sub-cap sized t1 command ship. the rational, i'm assuming, is that it is an ore sub-cap, and like the other caps and sub-caps it requires the underlying racial skill at level v.mining barges always took me as being weird ships; everything else either had their own race specific ship skill (raven -> caldari battleship ii) or required a race specific ship skill in addition to the skill for that ship class (myrmidon -> battlecruiser ii & gallente cruiser iii). mining barges, and their skill, stand alone. it is effectively a racial ship skill. now that ore produces more than barges, and they all require the barge skill despite not being barges. back when ore only produced mining barges the skill name worked well, but if ccp keeps giving us goodies from ore, the name should reflect what the skill really does now-a-days: lets you fly ore ships.so, my suggestion: rename the \"mining barge\" skill something like \"ore mining and survey vessel\"... or even simply \"ore industrial\".(preemptive reply) now that i've wasted a minute of your life that you're never getting back, i return you to your regularly scheduled eve."

"no skill that reduces mineral consumption by any significant amount is allowable. i get perfect refine and as soon as someone else getting perfect build we get a super hi pe and print isk. enough people doing it ruins the economy.that said few people would be affected by reduction in time to a significant degree.maybe use it to increase the chances of invention, lower the damage per run on t2 stuff like ram electronics or such. i do agree their needs to be a use.i also dislike advanced spaceship command. you need it to 1 for a freighter and 5 for everything else. it is like ccp just wants an extra month subscribed before you get to capitals."
"i'm sure that t2 producers across eve would cry out for joy if ccp chose to add an extra multiplier to t2 profit per time; 25-33% more income (at skill 4-5) per the op's suggestion would be excellent for their bottom line. but i also don't think that would be fair, especially since the skill is required to produce t2 in the first place. i think it's fair to say that most people don't believe the profits from t2 production are too little. at the same time, i think that the majority of, say, battleship/battlecruiser production is done from 1-3 run bpcs set up as an afk job, and this time reduction would have no meaningful impact for them.it's far too easy to get perfect construction, having an additional skill that improves efficiency by a tiny amount (such as 0.5% per level) would be good to grant a slight edge toward those who specialize without becoming a requirement for entry, as production efficiency is."
"i've petitiones myself the fact that players join fw militia and together with pirates shoot blues. in one such of case fc give the order to shoot that blue that was spying and working together with pirates. as a result i lost faction standing from 8.7 to 6.7. problem is that we can't defend ourself from these ppl and we only lose the fun and isk. and ccp respond me in their normal way:hi, thank you for your patience. i discussed this with my colleagues and we regret to inform you that spy is allowed in faction warfare, and if you shoot the spy, you will have to suffer from the standing loss. this is but the intended game mechanic. i'm sorry about the inconvenience this has caused. if you have any further questions, please feel free to let me know. thank you. best regards, gm jericho eve online customer support"
"as a test server player i watch for bad ideas and i have seen a monster of a bad idea. on the test server at this time explosion velocity of all missiles have been cut to 1/10 of what they are now. what this means (and we have tested it) is that 5 ravens with t2 precision missiles cannot hit a rifter with an afterburner running. if ccp goes with this nerf u had better sell your raven for scrap and train rails asap.the nano nerf u have dreamed of is even worse ...warp disruptors kill mwd and all ships take 50% longer to accel to top speed. kiss your mwd blasterthon goodbye and good luck getting out of a bubble.it all boils down to one more gallente/caldari nerf.check here if u want to take the nerfbat away."
"isn't there an entire forum for posting about changes on the test server?"
"fail. there is a new missile damage formula in development. old stats and new stats cannot be compared. read the freaking forum!"

"as discussed last night over too much alcohol, hereby the request to give us an order api instead of letting us do it manually through the wallet->orders->export button and then copy paste out of the file generated.this will save me personally alot of time, as it will do for many.(btw i checked, and as some said, it isn't made yet)."
"i'm sorry... but whats the purpose of an order api?"

"actually, i want to know too... since there is allot of that going on i think."
"i would welcome any change to the current bounty system since right now it's pointless to say the least. fw also needs more depth to it."
"also endorsing this candidate."
"endorsing this candidate aswell"
"awesome to hear your viewpoints vukgood to see people who agree local if removed needs another good information gather tool/complete reworking of scanning systembut imo why fix something that isnt broken. in the end ccp usually farks it up anyways.but yah support this guy."
"i know these questions weren't asked specifically of me, but they were asked in enough candidate threads that i figured i should throw in my two cents. the csm seems to me to be, as much as anything, a way of formalizing developer-player interactions. forum chatter is limited in usefulness, because it overemphasizes the vocal minority, and ccp wants something better. the csm should be a way of filtering out bad ideas, developing good ideas, and conveying them to ccp in as usable a form as possible. the first incarnation of the csm did a fairly good job of this, but there's certainly room for improvement. there needs to be a better big picture view of what topics the csm raises, rather than the pet projects of eight players and whatever looks good to a ninth. there needs to be some thinking about what the csm wants to say on a topic, rather than just taking a thread and passing it along. and there needs to be better communication with players to ensure that they are on the same page too. i constitutionally dislike nerfs - they seem like proof of bad design to me. balance in a complex game is best achieved via an interlocking series of countermeasures to tactics, strategies working contrary to each other, and so on, not by tweaking numbers. you may have to tweak numbers to make an individual item properly balanced within a tactic (the pre-buff apocalypse contributed nothing to the game, for example, because it did the same task as the armageddon and the abaddon, but worse), but i'd rather provide a countermeasure to an overpowered tactic than making the tactic worse. let players achieve balance through a vibrant metagame, don't use the nerfbat to do it. as for guerrilla warfare, the problem seems to be less with the ships used to do it as it is with the lack of targets. a proper guerrilla force uses flexibility to hit inadequately defended targets of value, and to flee before their opponents can react(since if they waited, they'd lose the ensuing set-piece battle). there's a lot of ways of doing this at present, and even after the nano nerf comes in there'd still be a lot - you may flee slower, but your pursuers are slower too. the problem is, what can you do to an enemy system while your gang is in it that would matter? there might be one ratter, and if you're really lucky a few ships in a mining gang, and all of them will cloak, flee, or log before you can reasonably come to grips with them. you break their rat chains, and go home having slowed one player's income gathering for an hour. no roaming gang has the firepower to break down the infrastructure that exists as-is (or else it's big enough to be courting battle instead of fleeing it), and you can't hit his mobile assets unless he wants you to. if you want guerrilla warfare to be plausible, you need to either make it possible to use guerrilla tactics to fight pos battles, or you need to make something smaller than a pos and less mobile than a ship that's still worth destroying. i value integrity in a person because not everybody has it. my contract history is littered with one-sided contracts, because i trusted the other person to do what they said they would do. when i don't trust them, i double-check everything and only complete things i can verify, and i certainly don't give them access to my corporation's wealth. there should be better features for tracking and security settings, especially inside corps. there's a lot of problems with the corp management system as-is. but the concept of scamming is fine."
"it should be possible to gank in hisec - i'm a believer in the philosophies of \"concord provides consequences, not protection\", and \"by clicking undock, you accept the possibility of pvp\". i don't think it should be especially easy to do it profitably and well, and i like the recent changes to security penalties(triple the baseline and multiply it by system sec, for those who don't know), but it should be possible. not to put too fine a point on it, but ccp screwed the pooch. not only did they blow their public relations(seriously, can you think of a single dumber move than perma-banning a whistle-blower, and doing it publicly after he's made the whole community aware of what happened?), but they also shook the confidence of their player base badly. they should have fired t20 instantly and very publicly upon verification of what had happened - and no face-saving resignation either, but an outright firing. their \"...and make sure it never happens again\" part wasn't so bad, since it was both quickly implemented and seems to have actually been done fairly well, but their response to the initial problem was completely wrong. and yes, they should reinstate kugu. probably give him a free couple years of training while they're at it, to make up for what they deprived him of. for that matter, giving him a job at internal affairs is a tempting idea - when you've got a credibility problem, who better to hit up than the guy who just finished raking you over the coals for your very real failings? of course, all this should have happened when the problem first came to ccp's attention, not a year and a half later, but it's a bit late for that. a little bit, but for very good reasons. part of the \"cold and dark\" nature of eve in the early days was that the universe was fundamentally empty. there was no infrastructure, there were no players, and there was no documentation(from the developers or the community). because of that, everything was fresh and unknown and exciting. since then, the player base has expanded massively (by a factor of 8, i think the number was), pretty much everything is explained if you look, there's an outpost in every tenth system in 0.0, and there's support nets for everybody, old and new. of course space is going to feel less cold and dark when you can have 1400 in local. in some ways, i regret the loss of the aesthetic, even though i wasn't there to see the early days. it sounds like it was an exciting time, even if the program was even more likely to lead to pulling out one's own hair then than it is now. but the aesthetic isn't gone, even if it has receded a little, and the compensation is a better game with more players and that's welcoming to newbies(who, despite the inevitable ribbing we give them, really are necessary). i consider that a fully worthwhile trade."

"i think the csm's main objective is to let ccp know which issues are the most important to the community. the existence reason of the council is that most player ideas dwell in the forums, surrounded by big piles of garbage and forum trolls. ccp does not have the manpower / intention to creep through all of it... so here we are, csm, do the work for free, figure out what people want, and discuss it with them. besides: it is possible to make a discussion with 9 people. it is impossible to make a discussion with 200.000 people. csm's job is also to filter out the garbage. as the council is an ongoing project, the goals outlined here are not something you can completely achieve. i think the council during the first cycle did however follow these goals. if you ask me if the council's operation had any actual effect on eve, that is another question. the council sure did hell a lot of work. a few men-month for sure. but as far as i can see, none of the issues passed through have made it into patch notes yet, so we have no measurable achievements yet. i am curious myself when the fixes and features requested will hit the game. unfortunately the csm cannot control that. speed has been nerfed several times so far. the speed change that is about to be implemented is just one more in the line... remember the time when they changed the nanofibers? or when they removed the possibility to fit multiple mwds on a ship? those speed nerfs were hitting quite a lot of ships a lot harder than the upcoming one. all those nano-machs, nanophoons, nanodomis and nanoravens are gone. thanks god. anyways, as you may have learned, i am a matar pilot. i am concerned about the speed nerf, as it not only affects the game style i am trying to represent, but it will literally transform most of my hangars into a collection of minmatar garbage. my corp is also full of minmatar pilots, i fly nothing but minmatar, so i have good reason to be anti-speed-nerf. but i am not. why? because i believe ccp does actually know quite a lot about what they its doing. i firmly believe that they want to make the game better, and not worse by introducting this change. ccp likes 0.0. and they must also like roaming and guerilla level warfare, as with all their employees together they still can't make a decent blob where they could test this stuff :) so they surely test it on smaller scale :) do you remember the gun nerf? old times, when an 1400mm howi whacked your ceptor orbiting it at 500m, when signature radiusses did not matter at all? or do you remember the missile nerf, where the missiles stopped doing full damage on whatever target they could catch? there was a big turmoil on the forums back then, but in the end the game got better, more balanced. i think the same will happen with the speed nerf. i think people will still keep flying nanoships. why? because right now, nano ships have two important abilities: 1) they can use their speed to tank stuff while they kill stuff2) they can use their speed to get out of disadvantageous situationsnanos are great in fleeing from battle! that's why roaming and guerilla gangs use them... to get quickly in and out of combat. gank whatever comes, flee if reinforcements arrive. and i believe the nano nerf might kill point 1), solo pwnmobile. but point 2) will remain: nanoships will still be able to disengage. and as we are talking about nanogangs, we talk about multiple ships... so taking out gankable stuff will still not be a problem. the guys however, who used to fly around alone in their vagas and kill whatever they find, no matter if bs, frig or command ship, well, they will be screwed screwed. they will need gangmates. or another ship. i hope they will overcome this trauma somehow."
"i value integrity and trust, and i think corp theft and scamming are morally wrong, but i do not see a reason why they should be removed from the game. i think that ccp should do everything to prevent the type of scams which are based on the visual and textual similarities of two items / forms, because these are clearly the resulted by the weakness of the ui. however i think that scams which require effort and intelligence, like pyramid games and \"investment banks\" and players exploiting the trust of others should remain legit. these are not nice things to do, i would feel bad if my son did things like that, but i think they are things that make eve special.as someone who has first hand experience in this field, i am pretty happy that it has been made more difficult, because there were so many people doing it that the minimal value of the ship they needed to start shooting went down so far, that it was not really worth spending time on it any more. at least that's why i stopped it. i mean when some noobs tried to gank my hauler for some 80 mil of loot, that was pretty pathetic. i hope in light of the recent changes this profession will lose a lot of its popularity, haulers will feel safe, start hauling more and more valuable stuff using autopilot, and i can get back into my mega and make some money. i do not know much about **********. i have been reading his forums when he first started posting stuff from internal alliance forums. i found it quite funny. every alliance should make sure to keep their internal stuff protected. as for the developer misconduct: well, i was quite of outraged when i first heard about them. i still am a little bit, actually, but feelings fade with time. anyways, i think that the developer misconduct was completely unacceptable, should never be allowed again to happen because they are very bad for the game. can you clarify this question a little bit?"
"my candidation,as there is so much to read for you from all candidates ill try to stay brief as possible and give a clear explanation why i got triggered to take part of the 2nd council.i want this project (csm) to become a success!lead in: i seen a lot of ideas from all dedicated people who love playing this game, but ask yourselves this: will 9 people with just good ideas be capable to get the job done? the answer is: no!put 9 muppets together and you get the muppetshow not a council.who is extreme?im a high profile player in eve and created my corporation eye of god more than 5 years ago.i started playing eve since beta and my specialties are that i can setup and lead projects, communicate with my members and satisfy them in their in game needs, create plans and execute these. eye of god solely builded 3 outposts in eve, we lost these during war but are still proud that we have achieved to have these builded as a team!i am very talented in analyzing structures, problems and create solutions, a team builder.my goals for the 2nd council:#1: i want to build a true team with the next group of councilorswithout a good team all your ideas and input will fail. #2a: i want to prevent elite forming within the councilthis whole csm project will collapse if we accept the  hey we were already in the first council and thus we do things our way #2b: create guidelines for future councilsin order to prevent failure of future councils i like to create guidelines that in the end can be adopted by ccp, kind of constitutional laws.final words:i do have some ideas but these are more on ceo & alliance leadership level.for instance at ccp/eve in las vegas we had eog vapour all the way from costa rica to ask ccp about an improvement of the mail system (no need to get into detail here), were 2 or 3 years later and the mail system is still like it was since 4 years ago.as a csm i can accept a no from ccp concerning representing your ideas but i do want to know the reasons why from ccp and then will give the eve players community feedback with an explanation why. a vote for me is a vote for the team, a vote to success!i really need all your votes!"
"at this point, we, as the eve-online gaming public, are aware that the csm reps didn't really do anything other than argue in chatrooms over bureaucratic issues. what assurances do we have that you can navigate this nightmare of red tape to do what needs to be done? whatever that happens to be? or barring the ability to actually achieve anything, that you can use your formidable powers to annoy the other members?"

"my views, which are i think, the oens the ccp are coming to terms with are that they designed 1 racial version of each, as a happy compromise between all the tasks you'd need a capital ship to undertake and that if you could go back in time, designing 2-3 different types of carrier within the same tier as well as 2 types of dreadnoughts, would been the way to go.carrierstransport/ship mover, weaker defence capabilities, less hp, less slots, but able to carry 5-6 battleships at eg. 10* ly base jump range.+ jump range ship bonuseslogistics carrier, remote rep orientated, less fighter/drone damage, greater cap recharge, fewer high slots, +hp and cap related bonusesbattle carrier, 7-8 high slots, thanatos style drone/fighter bonuses, shorter jump range, cargobay and ship maint bay.dreadsdefensive dread, more hp/slots, shorter jump range, stront use reduction bonusesattack dread, greater jump range, less hp/slots and endurancei could understand the earlier idea of a carrier nerf, however it would have been unacceptable without the addition of a new 2nd tier of capital ships resembling the following.there either underwhelming or overpowered, it's coming to the point where most 0.0 alliances have mothership fleets which are just essentially better carriers where as the titan really doesn't provide the type of mobile base you would expect it to function as. as long as they can be killed, i don't imagine them to be game breaking although there prevailance throughout 0.0 suggests a lack of tactical alternatives more than anything else.unintuitive, monotonous, tactically bankrupt and would require a rethink into the whole idea of sovereignty, what it means and what it's benefits should be. for instance, you *beat* alliances by taking there space, the truth is moral falls and an alliance collapses from within. pos's, and sov are only the lightening rods for this to happen. this shouldn't be the case, or at least the only way of having this happen and i believe the answer would probably revolv around new victory conditions for war delcarations.also, at the moment, the current sov mechanics encourages alliances to hold vast amounts of space. this isn't helped by the extreme deficiency of resources per system (2 people could effectively maximise the entire resources of a solar system without an npc station). vastly increasing the resources per system, and increasing the variety of niches in which entities can exist. corporations should be able to anchor bases within a multitude of places within solar the solar system all feeding towards a central sov generating structure at the systems star.i don't mind them personally, although i would like counters, mobile jump bridge jammers (t2 tier 2 battlecruiser for instance), so you could, for a limit time, give yourself some cover from lee blob.they should be hackable, (covert ops + 20 = no shield) otherwise, there ok"

"communicationand the fact that the the ccp is failing to publish there accomplishments in any meaning full or detailed way is a massive failure.as a csm, my responsibility would be to act as a reporter first, making sure the eve community understands what the ccp is up to, and detailing and publishing my reports on my blog... this process has already begun...the speed changes are a band aid on a much more serious hit mechanic problem, and that small gang pvp is really more related to motivations, and mentalities. read the rest here...essentially, if more people are in smaller groups, looking for smaller groups to fight because they have an insentive to, combined with the fact that the outcome is less predictable, then small gang warfare should naturally increase....i'll try and answer the other questions soon."
"hello ex-corpie :v,run through your ideas on asteroid belts for me. in addition, perhaps you could throw your ideas on small gang pvp into the mix, as they seem to be interlinked (at least from reading your blog).your thoughts on eve lore too, and what you'd change (if you would make any). what about player interaction in the prime fiction; by which i mean would you allow players to have an impact upon it, and in what way?"
"blog has been updated."
"hi all,now the race has seem to have started, i am not sure if there is a public chat in game yet so all 42 of us in this race can start a dialogue/debate ?so i have created one. for this to be usefull it will be a public channel so the public can take part of it. for this to be fair to all candidates i will set them admin rights on the channel so they can modify motd, expell eachother and change the password so it will be just them in it.in game chat channel: csm public chathope to see many there soon."

"please answer the following questions in detail.what do you believe csm should achieve as an entity, do you believe the previous session did that?how do you feel about the current speed-change and its effect on guerrilla warfare, specifically?if you value things like integrity and trust, how do you feel about things like corptheft and scamming in eve?how do you feel about hisec \"ganking\"?what are your views on **********, the developer misconduct, and internal affairs?do you think that eve has in any way diminished in the \"cold dark universe\" aspect in the last five years, and if so, is that a bad thing?"
"what do you believe csm should achieve as an entity, do you believe the previous session did that?the csm is branded as the council of stellar management, its objective is and has been very.... open. personally i see the csm for just what they are. elected officials. they are there to represent their consituants, the players who voted them in based on the views and opinions. as an entity they should bring issues forward and push for solutions. the gm`s, delevopers, and people within ccp don`t play this game to the extent, degree or in the same way that we do, and thus can loose perspective rather easily on the simple things that can be such an incredibly important aspect of gameplay. as independent of ccp, the csm can take a hard-line and express things that ccp as a business may not endorse or like. i think the current csm did \"o.k.\" they were the first, and there was alot of... newness to overcome. it should be noted that some of them were far more useful than others in creating legitmate discussion and keeping the opinions of their voters out there. i however don't see anything that i can directly attribute to the csm, since they have come forward they have surely added to the discussion, and yet because of a lack of communication i think it is hard to attribute those success's directly to the csm. how do you feel about the current speed-change and its effect on guerrilla warfare, specifically?i think that it breaks the knee's of alot of pvp style. within eve you are taking one style and often transversing it against another in a rock paper scissors stlye of overseen combat. i think the speed nerf is far to hard hitting for a problem that was not that large. there was certainly and undisputably, an imbalance, but as we so often have, when we have the pendulum one way, rather than search for balance we swing the pendulum the other way.polycarb's needed nerfing, and the way that speed mods stacked needed nerfing. did the entirety of mwd combat need it? i don't think it did.if you value things like integrity and trust, how do you feel about things like corptheft and scamming in eve?i hate it. i don't like corp-theft and i don't like scamming. the way that corp theft happens in eve is a necessary evil to ensure we stay within the confines of \"what you do matters\" asset management however.most of the scamming that goes on is directly related to bugs or poor communcation within the contract system, and i think that some simple fix's could save alot of trouble. methods of scamming where people are just being stupid is there own business, and while i don't like it, i don't think that gm's should have to waste their time with it, running much along the lines of \"what you do matters\" asset management that makes eve uniquehow do you feel about hisec \"ganking\"?its been fixed pretty heavily, but i would still like to see mabe a 50% increase in the sec-standing loss so as to make it so that while your not safe in high-sec, high-sec gankers have to choose legitimate targets and use their security standing sparingly.what are your views on **********, the developer misconduct, and internal affairs?i think he is a necessary evil, he's like the media, he reports what he see's. he certainly has a slant on his opinion, so you by no means cannot call him un-biased, but in general he did give out the facts.i think the developer misconduct was mishandled, the communication to the players was so horrible, and the response time and rug-sweeping was ill-done as well.internal affairs directly arose based on the whole event, and while it seems odd to need a department like ia in ccp, it has produced good results and at least gives the players someone they feel that they can rely on to keep the field even. i would like a report however or some communication on what ia has done to be public, just because communication is key in almost all things, this kind especially."
"do you think that eve has in any way diminished in the \"cold dark universe\" aspect in the last five years, and if so, is that a bad thing?eve is easier than it was. especially for younger players, but not significantly so. i sent a buddy i had introduced to the game, 150m, to get him some implants and ships, a few days later pirates killed and podded him. he wanted more isk, but i gave him none. eve is a \"cold dark universe\" where you need to learn the lessons of survival to both appreciate and enjoy the game. so yes, its not as cold and dark, but its still dark enough for me."
"do you think actions taken by ia to limit employee access to playing the game is positive?who are you irl, what's your background, what are your qualifications?what's your platform, what do you stand for, what do you want to see changed, why are these things important to you?are these changes feasible, do you think adding them would benefit the game as a whole, or just specific play styles?why are you a better choice than anyone you're running against?besides yourself, what other two people would you like to see elected to csm this term?if given the opportunity, would you take steps to limit corptheft, scamming, spying, and other \"questionable\" avenues of gameplay similar to these."

"posting to show my support for vily."
"do you think actions taken by ia to limit employee access to playing the game is positive?could you be more specific?who are you irl, what's your background, what are your qualifications?in real life my name is jeffrey groom, i just finished my first degree at university and for the last little while have been paying off some debt in my hometown working as a bartender/bar manager. i have lots of experience organizing events and managing resources and people. education background is in business, with a political science minor. im qualified because i have played this game for over three years now, i have done just about everything that the game offers, from pvp, to pve, mine and run pos, i have played with new players and old players and i listen, to the best of my ability to my own instincts but also the opinions of those around me.what's your platform, what do you stand for, what do you want to see changed, why are these things important to you?in my opening littler dither there, i state that i see eve as unique and incredible universe (rather brutal one) but what we have could use improvement. i know that sometimes ccp misses little things that drive old players mad, and that a little bit of experience can change things drastically. im campaigning on the hope that null sec can continue to reamin playable, enjoyable, and fun for the people that live there without the continual and drastic shifting towards en-trenched territorial power. i stand for truth, justice, and the right to kill anyone who plays this game. i believe that the design of eve is so unique and that is what makes it so playable long-term. so i stand for the status quo on the idea of eve, i don't however stand for the status quo on how the mechanic's work on things like titan's, terriorial warfare, pos, or guerilla style combat. all this is important to me because i love eve, and without the constant tweaking and improvement eve is only a single bad patch or one giant communication error from having positive growth to negative growth. are these changes feasible, do you think adding them would benefit the game as a whole, or just specific play styles?your asking for exact changes, which i don't exactly lay out within my campaign. so i'll give some issue's/fix's i would like handled.ammon balancing - t2 high damage ammo is pointless, scorch/barrage is godly, fleet ammo is the standard for the rich. somewhere in there some things need some love and others need some pain. easily feasible and affects everyone.titan balancing - 1 button click, 60 wrecks, while i dont know what the exact fix is, there is certainly something that needs to be canged somewhere. being both easily feasible and enhancing gameplay for just about everyone within null sec. capital rebalancing - pheonix/naglfar are massively underpowered compared to revelation/moros. while this would only affect a small group of players directly, it would indirectly affect basically the whole of capital warfare, which basically effect's everyone in null-secmissiles changes - so that their useful but not so that their overpowered. velocity that can be mitigated but not totally removed. is it feasible? all dpends on how well it has been refined.low-sec rebalancing - there is no real reward to rat or mine in low-sec. its more dangerous than 0.0 and yet it carries no benefit. piracy has long needed a reason to get people back into the belts in low-sec and a revival of low-sec as an acutal alternative to 0.0 combat.bounty/kill rights changes - the selling of kill rights seems so easy. it would drastically change the dynamics of the bounty system creating what could possibly be an interesting profession.contract system layout fixing - very simple, removes alot of scamming and gm, pains in the ass. is it feasible? i would think easily. i think it would it would benefit the game in general with only really minor actual"
"why are you a better choice than anyone you're running against?experience. fundamental understanding of game mechanics and the people who play this game. dedication and the ability to listen and represent the people who lend me their trust.besides yourself, what other two people would you like to see elected to csm this term?ankhesentapemkah, because while she does not represent my views in any way shape or form, she does represent the people that put her there well. she has shown she is actually willing to put the effort and time into this council that is required and because a diversity of viewpoints often creates the best discussion and outcome.pattern clarc, because he seems organized and well versed, he has a focus on communication that i agree with and like and seems to be the kind of guy i could see myself working with productively on the councilif given the opportunity, would you take steps to limit corptheft, scamming, spying, and other \"questionable\" avenues of gameplay similar to these.scamming only in the way listed above (simple contract fixes)spying only within faction warfare where you cannot even remove the spy's you knowcorptheft, i would like to have possibly a give/take log created viewable by the ceo/directors, so that culprits could be properly identified, but otherwise no.as for other questionable gameplay? its very case by case some i can think of- logging off before you dissappear timer could be a little longer- cloaking timers (1m cooldown every couple of hours or something) afk cloaking pain- remote repping in empire causing proper flagging in a way that wont get abused"
"1 - ensure that the coming changes to territorial warfare are done properly and do not favor any one side or entrenched interest. doing so in a way that also promotes combat for the fives man gang as well as the fifty man gang.2 - communication, communication, communication. ccp needs to communicate better, on nearly everything. we the players scream for more information daily, and yet we often get a single developer response when we should have fifty. talking to people, even when your ignoring them can make a huge amount of difference. as a csm one of the most important things i would like to do/see done is to have ccp improve this, whether it means employee's dedicated to it or just simply a little more clarity within what people at ccp do. would also like to see an open piece of internal affairs with visible actions/whatever but being the realist i am i could only hope for minimal results at best with that.3 - create a role, purpose, or identity for the csm. get some minor things accomplished but let it be known that it was the csm that did it. if ccp wants this council to be successful they have to allow it to get some results that the people can see and attribute to the csm. alot of people claim the csm is useless, and the only way to break that stereotype is to get some stuff done. once we do that, the more clout we can gather as csm representatives."

"i'd like to see more sources of income for the average alliance member. things to do besides ratting, mining and running exploration sites. your alliance might be mining the pretty moons, but that does not flow into the wallet of the grunts, and instead of a salary they have to pay taxes. i think things need to be more interesting, more rewarding, for the masses below the executive level. however, i also think that the real empire-builders should have more empire-shaping game mechanics, things to build and fight over besides those dull outposts. npcs should react to what the players do. this can come in the form of agents appearing in outposts, or pirate complexes showing up on the fringes only to disappear again if the players crack down on them. if players can set up their own missions to request services of other players, either through agents or an improved contracting systems, all the better. i am a firm believer of player-driven worlds, and it is time for the world of eve to react to player presence and actions.i also think that it should be quicker for new powers to get something out of 0.0 if they are skilled. this would encourage fresh blood to give 0.0 a try.i'd really like to see a rework of the 0.0 sovereignty mechanics. pos warfare is dull and boring for the participants. what i would like to see is objectives besides pos warfare, worked out in a way that smaller, mobile gangs can get behind enemy lines, cause some damage (and get some loot in the process) and get out again. this way tactical gameplay is encouraged more, instead of just mustering the biggest fleet to the fight. it can also be set up in such a way that it provides direct reward to the participants, encouraging people to participate in 0.0 conflicts.i will discuss 0.0 with ccp in a few days at the fanfest, so instead of telling you what i would, i'll tell you what i did. i still would like to see a large-hull exploration vessel as it is stupid that people are required to have two accounts, one to scan and one to clear the site (or move a load of jumps to fetch another ship).not yet, objectives for smaller, fast, mobile fleets first.cool is subjective, and even though i have plenty of ideas as displayed above, i'd still like a lot more of community feedback to hear what they think is cool and should be added to 0.0."
"in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?0.0 income is where it should be at. its hig-sec/low-sec income that is out of balance. with a proper balancing to the rewards of high-sec you make 0.0 more appealing and thus create a more diverse population.how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?unfortunatly at the moment the evolution of 0.0 has taken the wrong direction, favoring more to heavily entrenched parties unable to be removed by even the most powerful forces. i think there needs to be a rebalance within 0.0 to allow for smaller groups to be more viable and change the outcome of warfare.

"in detail, answer the following questions if you please:i'm interested to hear what your opinion is on social manipulation, in regards to the sandbox game that eve is supposed to be. especially in regards to scamming, corporate theft, and ship hijacking from poses, as well as extortion by means of war declarations and verbal (ic) threats.furthermore, i'd like you to expand upon your statement that you will be pushing for ccp to leave player run corporations / not be allowed to play their own game. please state reasons, and cite evidence to support your argument if any is available.sofia"
"about the social manipulation issue:my problem with scammers is that they trick players into buying stuff because those people don<U+FFFD>t read the \"fine print\". yes, it<U+FFFD>s their fault and they shouldn<U+FFFD>t get a refund for that, but do we need that? and if a scammer wants to make money, he should do what everyone else does. piracy, missions, wars, mining, ratting.corporate theft is just that, theft. if you steal from your own corp, you<U+FFFD>re a thief and that<U+FFFD>s worth a ban in my opinion. ship hijacking from an enemy pos is legit, if you shoot down the pos first, if you acquire the codes to the pos however, it<U+FFFD>s a total different thing for me. i<U+FFFD>m a bit draconic about that, but spying is a no go. if you join a corp, pretend to be a friend of someone and then betray them, that<U+FFFD>s not funny anymore. yes, i know. the game should be realistic and not everything is funny in real, even so spying and betraying is just spineless. if you want to fight, then fight with your ships and with tactics, not with spys.extortion by war declartation is legit, but the declaration system needs a rework. even if a war ends very fast when it<U+FFFD>s not mutual, you can declare war again to fast. there should be a longer waiting period before you can declare war againt the same \"enemy\" again. like half a year.and about extortion by verbal threats, in character threats are also legit, but as soon as it starts to get \"personal\"(rl)it<U+FFFD>s a no go.and about the issue of ccp employees in player corporations:what happens when you join a player corporation? you<U+FFFD>re working with others together, wage war with them, build up an empire with them and after a while you will become friends and start to care about them. so what happens if someone needs help because he recycled his dreadnought because he was drunk or needs information about another corp. will you help him or not? and thats my reason why i want that ccp employees aren<U+FFFD>t allowed to join player corps, because who can guarantee that they are always professional in their judgement, when they have to decide over someone they know or are friends with?"
"ignorance is bliss. eve has been sold as a cold, harsh world. reality can be a pain sometimes and,this is an example of it. what it looks like is you're trying to relate corporate theft to rl incidents, when the two only have minor similarities. capsuleers aren't governed by the same rules as others, as well as the fact that the empires, nor concord don't really involve themselves in corporate affairs. why should they do so now? what makes corporate theft such a serious issue that it deserves a ban?again, cold, harsh world. you don't get to choose everything that happens to you, and there is always a bigger fish. simplifiying methods just for certain people's perception of safety is a pretty poor excuse for such a thing, don't you think? in the end, social manipulation is a core part of any mmo, and thus, if the rules allow it, should be allowed free reign. how people use their resources is up to them, but i believe that was ccp's definition of the sandbox.why such a long period of time? this needs clarification.and about the issue of ccp employees in player corporations:eeeeh, people are responsible for themselves if they can log in. it's not a nanny state, it's a place where personalities can take the fore, and that's how people come to have opinions on others. however, i can see your point regarding ccp, but measures (less drastic ones at that) have been taken that seem to be working sufficiently well (internal affairs). clarify why you think that there needs be a crackdown in the coming months."
"as far as getting rid of scamming. eve is a game of consequences for your actions... if you cant figure out your about to be scammed... you deserve to be deprived of your isk.we dont need more 0.0 space, what the true problem is 0.0 leads to entrenched warfare and doesnt make room for the new guy to make headway. thats the true problem.either way, do not want!"
"good morning;one of the my ideas that you may find very interesting is that with the change to ghost training i would support bringing back the 30 day time code. this idea is simple as well as a money winner for ccp. contrary to popular opinion, not everyone is making billions of isk a week in this game. the same pilots also may not make enough real life money to support that second or third account. if ccp would bring back the 30 day gtc now, many pilots like myself might bring those accounts back online. lets face it, grinding 220-250 million isk a month means more time for pvp or whatever you like to do in this game. let me know how you feel!-rorin"
"bringing back 30day gtc's, while i would love to see it, won't cut down the price all that much. by using simple econonmics we can see that there's too large a demand for 60day gtc's compared to the supply. if you think that grinding that much isk is a problem and want it to be less, then make more people sell gtc's."
"this is a interesting idea but not workable, my idea is to cut down the gtc prices as much as possible, so that pilots all over eve can play the game they love in the way they like. not the one size fits all, that has now been forced on us. lots of pilots think the gtc prices are too high right now. my question to you is why would we want to make more people sell gtcs? the way to bring down the price slowly to a level where the game is once more affordable for all is not by restricting the market and peoples options, but by expanding them.-rorin"

"a couple of weeks ago we had biggest long-running soap opera in eve pf resolved at last by the coronation of jamyl sarum as empress of the amarr empire. this is the resolution of a very old plotline  tied into the eve novel, the empyrean age backstory  important to faction warfare and should be of vital interest to anybody roleplaying a character in the game of eve online. only somehow it wasntand i dont think you need to be a rocket scientist to understand what was missing: the potential for player interaction. the coronation was handled off screen  it didnt happen in space in any kind of event that players could get involved with. there were no ill-advised player assassination attempts no show of strength from the amarr navy. no centre stage for amarrian pc corps and alliances, no focus point for dissidents and protests or a hundred little stories of actual players trying to involve themselves with this thing. it was in short, a canned show-and-tell snowglobe style happening that doesnt really deserve to be called an event since there was literally nothing that any player in the universe of eve could do to affect it. and it doesnt matter how beautiful and glorious the canned video imagery is  and it doesnt matter how many times were told that the speech was inspiring  unless were there in space to see it, to hear it, to experience it  this is just uninspiring fluff and deeply below the standards weve come to expect from the eve online. now a little history.i remember an event almost 4 years ago that i attended that came to be called the elarel massacre by those players present and who heard about the things that happened there second hand and in the news reverberating in the days afterwards. the premise of the event was pretty simple  it was the launch of the quafe ultra product range by quafe corporation  and they were hosting a huge party for the best and brightest of the federation celebrity set alongside screenings of some racy holodrama with semi naked brutor girls cavorting in tribal costumes. quafe had deployed a prototype outpost for the proceedings  a pleasure garden station. id been contacted by storyline people role-playing quafe executives a week or so before and asked to a) organise a player party around the events and b) provide a security detail for the event to ensure nothing untoward would happen.so, i did what i was asked really, invited pretty much everyone in my address book and ensured that elarel was going to have every famous/infamous/acclaimed and notorious player that i could nail down. and meanwhile jericho fraction decided to do the security duty with some style and we all flew the brand spanking new interceptor class ships (30 or so) that we considered back then were simply better than battleships <U+F04A> (remember that crows used to be able to fire cruise missiles!)anyways  the night of the event rolled around and everybody came. elarel was packed out  the pleasure gardens station was in place (none of us had ever seen a capturable outpost back then). local was full of chat and repartee, and the events team had provided what seemed like dozens of fully briefed npc characters  quafe organizers, celebrities, holoactresses and musicians, politicians and security liasons  the whole shebang. and these celebs sure turned up in style  flashy ships, escorts, opus luxury yachts, real opulence and atmospheric decadence. so we had our show and tell moments sure, but it was all in space. we were there, we could lock onto the ships, we could settle our own scores and feuds while the event was going on. players tried ganking celebs, players got counter ganked and podded, curses and brutality  but the event rolled on."
"then all hell broke lose. the plotline had provided an entire attack wing of right-wing zealot lunatics called udi  who turned up in waves of cruisers and heavier ships and attacked  well everyone! it was carnage and chaos. streams of missile bombardments and gunfire, celebs going up in flames, the player guests joining in the adhoc defense, our heavily outgunned interceptors dog-fighting, event team characters pleading and begging to be spared in local while the pleasure gardens station begin to take heavy damage and everyone was warned to get to minimum safe distance. this was epic stuff. some of the best couple of hours gaming ive ever had with mmorgs. the players took heavy losses, but some of them made out like absolute bandits  i took part in the rescue of one celeb from udi attack guiding another player in with a tempest to pick up the celebs crew (okay cargo can) under heavy fire and meanwhile another guy was convincing some other celebs to eject from their opus yacht to save their skins. (opus was subsequently stolen and sold onto the private market).eventually the gallente navy turned up with president fouritan in personal attendance and the event turned into a q/a speechifying session and plenty of conspiracy theories were in wild attendance. (it was certainly the case that fundamentalist udi murders did wonders for fouritans eventual re-election campaign.).but you see the point? this is an event i still remember 4 years after it happened. hell, this is an event that a great many old players still remember fondly. it had a huge impact at the time. it was exciting, it was bold, it was something id never seen before in online computer games and it was closer to full on interactive storytelling with player action really counting. hell, if wed come with battleships wed probably have aced the udi and routed the buggers  but our choice to be gung-ho flashy so-and-sos in our brand spanking new interceptors meant we couldnt effective counter the multiple waves of udi ships and the pleasure gardens blew up! but so many smaller tales  the guy that go away with the opus  the victims that got assassinated during the party  the nationalists that got to rant at the president in real time. the pure chaos and conflict environment  it seemed real, it was all about suspension of disbelief and it was absolutely a perfect slice of eve. is anyone going to remember the jamyl sarums coronation event in four years time?so enough reminiscence, lets get down to some practicalities. the reason we dont have events like these any more is partially down to the maturing of eve online as a game (and ccp as a company) they have become more risk adverse over time and as the game has become serious business we see less and less of this kind of crazy icelandic thinking (lets run an event where all the devs get to play murderous fanatics shooting celebs at a quafe party and any player that brings a ship to get in the way)  and more and more routine boring workaday hands off canned event mediocrity.and its partly down to fiascos and disasters of the past  make no mistake. aurora (the old events team) was very far from perfect  it made some terrible events alongside its great events, it did sometimes have a stink of corruption in some of the things it got involved in. free motherships for 0.0 alliances? massive event rewards for following scripts? god-modding/ private events volunteer actors using aurora to benefit their friends and allies in game. who knows how much of this stuff is true, how much its urban myth, jealousy or just simple confusions and mistakes. but aurora did end up with a bad reputation at the end of it that led to its virtual dissolution in the wake and continuing fallout from the t20 scandal."
"and of course we the players need to take some blame too. events team was always plagued with a player events crew that spent their whole lives camping irc/rp channels and jumping on the merest suggestion of an event with all the firepower at their fingertips to score those epic event drops by shooting anything that needed protecting, by exploiting the aurora rules of engagement and generally acting like hungry hippos rather than roleplaying with aurora.but it comes down to this.have we lost too much? has ccps (understandable) reaction to the accusations of bias, cheating, stuff spawning, corrupt events and whatnot actually denied a huge number of honest and decent players from access to an ongoing and active events team? has the baby been thrown out with the bathwater here?now, ive been to ccps hq. ive met the guys and girls there. im convinced these are decent, passionate, committed people who love the game of eve, love the mythology and have a lot of time and energy to commit to the player base and community. ive also met internal affairs and been briefed on the scarily efficient procedures that now exist to ensure we arent going to get another t20 scandal in a hurry. ive been shown around; ive been given unrestricted access to employees of this company, ive asked hard questions and ive come away convinced that ccps house is in order. so now ive got to ask myself (and anybody reading this thread):given the improvements that ccp have made to the accountability of developer/employee behaviour and the checks and balances that have been implemented, why should live events of the kind that used to enliven and promote this game immensely, still be sacrificed on the pyre of last years developer misconduct?screw t20 to be quite honest. that stuff happened, its been addressed. ccp have moved on and so i think, have we. but lets not cheat ourselves out of all the great things that we could have from a dynamic and exciting live events team by dwelling on the misdeeds of one set of virtual sticky-fingers a couple of years ago. *** so, id like to propose quite simply that ccp fund and implement a new live events team that works as a combination of old (aurora) and new (mercury) and unites the best bits of actual in-game event running, player-involvement, dynamic plotlines with conflict and explosions, and the current excellent storytelling and news publication we are seeing around empyrean age and related player actions.in order to make sure it avoids the pitfalls of the past this new live events team will need to have its events properly audited  it will need to list the props and justify them  itll need to fill out a record of what happens at events and where the good stuff went of course. but that shouldnt be considered a huge onerous burden so much as just good practise when running a vast interactive roleplaying game of the sort that eve online can truly be.now, sure, this is expensive in terms of manpower  ccp would need to spend money to make this happen, but then again  everything takes money. development of the tiniest code alteration takes loads of it! ultimately part of the role of the csm was to advise ccp on what the players wanted to see from them  which priorities were most pressing, where people wanted to see the game going in the future. and i feel quite confident in saying at this point that a substantial number of players want the bold, exciting, non-conformist ccp that were prepared to take risks and do things that sony and blizzard would never dream of. this is a single server with a united history and the greatest community that any game of this kind is ever likely to get."
"fundamentally, eve needs live in-game events that well be talking about in 2012. to get these we need a live-events team and we need to ccp to stop panicking about corruption scandals and bad press and have the faith in the procedures theyve established and actions theyve taken and restore the functionality that aurora once had in an improved form with the accountability and trust required to take events forward and keep eve as the unique and exciting game it truly can be."
"that sounds like a rather impressive event. i'd love to see more of them on that level. as long as you avoid abuses, and i think they will, this stuff adds a whole lot to the game."
"still annoyed i didn't get the yacht..."
"i caught the tail end of aurora, entering cain after the brothers of freedom storyline kicked off. this storyline lead to a larger story of a conflict between the now defunct acheron federation (closed phoenix wing and strix) against cain and the now shadow of its former self apex conglomerate (if it even still exist, the big names from it became pirates, anarchist, and freespacers it seems). this is where i first got introduced to pvp beyond pirate gate camps on low sec gates. my first kill, a new strix member mining in an iteron (i hope he is still in strix) and the lose of a few of my own ships to good fights. the storyline making the news is what got me into rp in the first place!now i have to watch as my character's megacorp is dragged through the mud and research halts because noh is diverting supplies from lai dai cause suvee wants to mine instead of farm. how do i get to interact? i don't and nothing changes in world because i don't; all those research alts still will get their datacores even though the research agents are starving.rp is what causes to stick to with eve."
"sounds like pretty epic stuff... pity i missed it.i'd love to see it come back, but you also have to take ccp's view of it:with the number of people playing eve increasing monthly, in-space events have the potential to draw many hundreds, maybe even thousands of players to a single point in a single system. this would create a lag-bomb rivaling the greatest 0.0 alliance fights, which would then lead to all the familiar lag-bomb effects:- people unable to load the grid / outright crashing.- people losing ships (which they may very well have out fitted with their best stuff due to the nature of the event) due to above effects.- hundreds of petitions being spammed at ccp due to lost stuff.- the potential of crashing the node, which could ruin the whole event.- etc, etc, etc.so, you see, creating an in-game event these days could produce a truly incredible headache for ccp. this could be remedied by temporarily instituting a population cap on whatever system the event was to be in, but then people would be complaining about it.i'd still like them to return, though. just playing 'devil's advocate' here."
"yeah i remember that and more more events - when these events happened battles were forgotton and everyone jumped in - every event i remember was epic and a epic read - great funi remember one where salvadore sarparti was flying through tribute area with a fleet all flown by (i assume) gm's and dvs - gate camps forgotton and everybody hustled to get there,too many events to mention and ignoring the shouts of hax etc the events were well intentioned wasnt there one transporting supplies and a prize given to the winning corp?there was a planet that sort of died, mordus legion fleets flying around everyone of them fun to read about or try to participate in.definately has my vote"
"yes pleaseit's a shame that there are so many threads on this, it would be nice to see everyone in one ultimate threadnaught."
"i already voted for the topic with all of my chars, however i will just keep posting here to keep the thread on topi think this will be the only topic which will actually get 5% of eve population approval to be discussed on csm lol ! )in any casegief fukin queue !!! just lost half a day of training ffs !"
"full fukin support !!!"
"supporting !!!"
"what i want is the ability to change skills via my internet browser. (ie/firefox)like so we'd be able to set new skills just about anywhere without having to log directly in the game.plus, a one-skill queue could be great."
"nice idea!"
"well, where there is will there is a way.some things that can be considered to reduce worries of abuse:* only allow a certain amount (percentage of your real sp) to be trained instant or extremely fast. also make a reset option to revert to your real skills so people can try out different new content!* set a minimum 'online' level to make sure it is an active player on the live server. i am not sure ccp has all these statistics but it should not be too hard to get something that serves the same purpose.my favorite option would be option one as this allows players to test things that are beyond their reach or not even live yet. but not do so in a disproportionate way! this fully removes any abuse of new players dogfighting in titans or whatever!"
"against! i swear of a frickin' storm!"
"let me start with a little bit of history. long time ago, in a galaxy far away, there was an alliance called fountain alliance. my corp was was living in it, doing what new corps in 0.0 are doing, mining stuff and rattiing and losing ships. back in those days there were no posses, no capitals, no black ops. cynosular fields were never been heard of, jump technology was something the jovians were experimenting with, and failed badly and their remains were scattered all around the galaxy.anyways, back in these old days, the transportation of goods and the logistics of a corp went differently than they go today. in order to get our ships replaced, we needed ships on market or minerals, some of which were scarce resources in our region. we were organizing convoys from fountain to empire, a few combat ships, lots of frigates. we were escorting our zydrine filled haulers up the pipes to empire, there we brought new ships, and escorted ourselves and our isogen and module filled haulers back to fountain in an organized way. we had to do this as a corp event, or sometimes our alliance did it as an alliance event. it was a social activity with lots of people participating. on our way up, we met raiding fleets which needed to be taken care of. we ran into gate camps which actually had a reason to camp there, as they were there for the loot, not just for griefing losers in empty ships. despite the fact that the maximum number of players on server never went above 10.000, 0.0 was a much more vivid place than it is today, in the age of jump clones, jump freighters, carriers, titans, twinned bridges and ship maintenance bays.back in those days raiding gangs had actual achievable goals: disrupting logistics. gate camps had goals: loot valuable stuff and prevent enemies from returning to fleet battles. there were roaming gangs of all possible sizes, from small to large, gate camps from small to large, often aimed at preventing our enemies from slipping in one by one into our npc stations. these are times i enjoyed the most in my eve career. i miss them a lot. and i think i know the reason why this has changed. and this is also the reason why people recently find 0.0 a lifeless, underused, empty space. i think the main reason for this is not that there are not enough people. the reason is that there is not enough traveling around, because it can be solved else-how. even those who travel, do not risk all too much. one does not need to be a genius to see why the amount of travel has decreased. jump clones provide a way for completely safe transportation from one end of the galaxy to another. jump freighters, carriers, rorquals are also nearly 100% secure methods of transporting large amounts of wealth in and out of 0.0. jump bridge networks maintained by big alliances allow joe average to travel from his 0.0 home to empire in a safe and a quick way that was never possible before. these very same bridge networks, combined with titan bridges make it possible to get back into fleet fights instantly. safe hauling kills most of the logical (and ethical) reasons for small size gate camps. jump bridges make roaming gangs useless. titan bridges into fight make camping pipes around battlezones useless. today roaming gangs are not nearly as fun as they were earlier. why? because there are not enough people in 0.0? wrong. they are not fun because there is not enough movement in 0.0. it does not make much sense to blockade pipes. or hold empire choke-points. i think instead of \"finding a new objective for small sized roaming gangs\", it would make sense to look around and ask ourselves: where did the old objectives go?so... this is it. this is an issue. i know the problem. but i do not know the solution. discuss."
"this is why industrial, transport and normal freighters should be buffed!i'm not sure what i'm supporting, but i do believe that the good pvp does not necessarily have to revolve around logistics. sure you can protect your haulers with \"zydrine\", but it nothing prevents a bunch of griefers to alpha down your haulers. so a buff to industrial ships and make them more attractive to use."
"by supporting this you support that this is a problem worth mentioning to ccp."
"totally agree with op"
"ccp have no excuse not to give us a skill queue now that the 'orrible ghost training bug has been 'fixed'."
"1.0"
"i support this post for 100%, and i am pretty sure that at least 99/100 of the eve community will support this idea. it would certainly make me play more, as i have more time to finish real-life matters. as these matters are finished, i will have more time to spend in-game, as i won't have to interrupt real-life matters just to change skills.+1"
"definitely yes"
"yes"
"yes!"

"i vote no.the op and most of the others here want to discourage pve players from remaining in pve corps. i hate to break it to you, but there are a lot of players in this game like me. i play eve because it is the only space game i and my other real life friends can all log into and pretend we are starship captains, working together towards whatever end is entertaining us on a given day. however, i have this persistant delusion that my character is \"better\" than in other similar games because of the off-line skill training. i have time to play maybe 1 to 4 hours a week. some weeks not at all. eve's training system is good for me.for my friends and i, our skills in this game suck. our player vs player skills i mean, some of our characters have lots of points. we have no wish to pvp at all, ever. what is the point? i suppose that is another topic alltogether. but we enjoy reading about the pvp and 0.0 wars in the game we play. we just have no wish to partake of those activities ourselves.in another year or so star trek online will come out, and after this weeks announcement, star wars online v2.0 will be out a few years after that, and we will try those games for our pve fix. if they are better than eve pve wise, we will stay there. if eve is better, than ccp will continue to get our $15 a month.ccp is here to make money. like every corporation, their goal should be to maximize long term profits for their shareholders. this means accomodating mutiple styles of play at the same time. there are people that do not want to pvp ever. some of them play the game just to talk with others. some play the game to mine, or to build, or to buy and sell. some play the game to collect and fly all the pretty little ships. when ambulation is put in, some players will play just to hang out in space stations and flirt with other characters. ccp needs to accomodate these players, or they leave. going back to the op topic, i am still in a newbie corp. often when asked why i dont join a player corp i give the glib \"no tax and no wardec here\" answer. the real answer is long and involved, and there is a good chance that the other player won't understand that i just don't care about the parts of the game i am \"missing\". so...there are several people (not my real life friends) in my newbie corp that have been there for more than 3 years. they log in often (some daily) and chat, and play the game however they wish. get over it."
"agreed. i say put the tax at a flat rate for everyone, slightly above what most player corps charge."
"there is no point at all in depriving pve players of their game as it is, and they should have the most fun they can have in it, just like pvp players do. the only thing ccp has to be careful about is balancing income between the two. and don't forget there is a grey area as well, the market, scams and what more resources that are being competed for.some of the most loved implants that pvp players enjoy originate from the pve part of the game. why discourage that or for players to be vulnerable to wars? as soon as they go low sec to have an edge over their competing pve colleagues they are vulnerable to pirates and whatever danger there is....npc corp or not.i as a pvp player would have no fun decing corps that are pure pve or mining oriented. sure the first few juiy kills, the noob chat etc, fine, but its not lasting. so there is no point in forcing them out! i'd rather see low sec be made less safe as a pirate by nerfing sentry guns so small ships can also work there.eve is a coalition of different playing styles and its not always perfectly balanced, but ccp should not try to force everyone into one style. people affected wont accept it and leave as soon as they find out there is no way they can even compete! what do the pvp layers gain from it?less income for cpp = less content, less piracy opportunities, we got to do more grinding ourselves to get said implants and what else.so, i strongly reject this proposal!"
"this issue was voted on and rejected by the csm.you may try to raise it again for the next csm term though."
"so go prove that my options for achura will be better than the options you get. oh wait, we don't have any information on that.that only lets us change to another portrait of the same bloodline and gender.that is all i'm asking for. when ambulation comes out, all existing characters get a chance to change their bloodline and gender once when creating their first avatar. then we are all locked into the choice we make."
"not something world shaking, but a good suggestion./supported."
"ok, i just saw this post... that explains it... but it's still a rude behavior shown there from the gm..."
"it just doesn't make any sense not to have a repair option in context menu, while destructive options like trash are in there. what is so different about repair that it should not be in there next to refine, contract, reprocess and trash)? clarification:to repair anything, everyone i know will currently select everything they own in a station in the item selection window that you get after clicking on the repair button. this because it is very cumbersome to select the things you want to have repaired manually in a scrollable check-box list. the result of this inefficient interface is lag, sever load, and since recently...prolonged locking off all your assets even after the repairs are long done. this means you can't change ships because they are being \"repackaged\" when in fact they are not. then you got to re-log to be able to change ship again, etc. not good!comparison with contracts:when ccp introduced the same interface for contracts as we still have for repair, people were falling over them left right and center. then they changed it a little there to make it more workable.there still is a difference however. with contracts you can do an asset search (or simple select your ship) and then right-click, create contract. so here at least you have the option of making the choice of what you want the contract to affect in step 1 of the process. people use this and kind of ignore the new selection window ccp put in there in between, which serves no one in the slightest, its just dead weight.this first step selection is what we need for repairs as well to make it workable and reduce server load!"
"i am supporting my own issue \o/"
"why change them so they have an effect already - ccp have already hinted at tech3 coming (with info coming at fanfest), why not have the skills being used for benefits to t3 construction rather than changing the current playing field."

"good to see you going for the csm, good luck"
"eva has done a good job in the first csm term. i have talked with her a lot, and her moderate position and professional views have always impressed me. when she says balancing, she is fully neutral. balancing does not mean kill the big players, no! when she says balancing, she wants to introduce attractive objectives for the smaller players. she will not take away, she will add.she wants to improve transparency of the csm, improve communication to both ccp and the player base. right she is! she has drawn the right conclusions of the first term.her forum, take care, which is a political party if you want, is a great way of further focussing issues, and it also helps communication.i will vote for ankhesentapemkah."
"i'll vote ankhesentapemkah as well, when i figure out where i can vote ;)i've mailed with her in game and she seems a very great candidate. she has very good points made on her site and i think she's someone who stands her ground."

"tip of the day #3i have been commited to letting people know what has been going on with the csm during the current term. one of these ways have been trough the magic of internet spaceship podcasts.i'm featured in following podcasts:wda 42wda 40wda 32 - pre-election predictions"
"what do you believe csm should achieve as an entity, do you believe the previous session did that?how do you feel about the current speed-change and its effect on guerrilla warfare, specifically?if you value things like integrity and trust, how do you feel about things like corptheft and scamming in eve?how do you feel about hisec \"ganking\"?what are your views on **********, the developer misconduct, and internal affairs?do you think that eve has in any way diminished in the \"cold dark universe\" aspect in the last five years, and if so, is that a bad thing?"
"hello vs well, it really depends on what's *important* for the community at the time. right now the community wants a skill queue. would that be the ultimate achievement to make ccp commit to make a skill queue? yeah. the first csm isn't done yet, and it seems like it will be raised again for discussion with ccp. but also the csm should communicate alot. while it's not an achievement per say, it's damn important. this first csm failed at that.so far from flying on sisi, it's quite ok. it's not the best, but hey. i'm a big fan of diversity and variety. right now we have a large spectrum of speeds and how much you can survive. the nano nerf will squize that a bit together, possibly making it a bit more predictable. however, it *will* take more actual piloting skills to do as it's currently done. but i still think it will be viable.but it still doesn't cure the cause of nanoing: blobbing. i very much value integrity and trust. however, corptheft and scamming *is* a part of eve and i respect that people do it. i have been scammed before. but i think it's a valid profession.this is a very valid profession. however, it's currently possible to gank almost worthless targets and *still* gain profit from it, because insurance almost covers the whole loss but sec status loss. i think insurance should be removed from high-sec ganking.the ********** case was a can of worms obviously. he did technically break the eula and ccp does reserve all rights to ban anybody at any time. ********** could be unbanned, however i'm not sure about his intentions at all.the csm spoke to the head of internal affairs at our iceland meetings, and judging from the way it's being done, i'm pretty sure they will find out of a ccp employee does something bad. yeah, i think it has diminished. not only from an actual game universe perspective but also from a social perspective. we have obviously grown in size in terms of players. so it's hard to find anywhere, where there isn't players beyond deep 0.0. but people has also created some interesting social structures and become increasingly paranoid to scams.i would like to see a more vast experience where there's stuff to do and explore. ccp hasn't increased the height of the game as players grew higher due to power gaming. and i think that's what makes a difference eventually."
"tip of the day #4my main interest out of eve is computer science. my first \"real\" language was c#. i soon learned about how nice vb.net is to code in, whereafter ricdic made me code the prototypes for ebank. it was back when the api was all new and shiny(and even back then it left a lot to be desired, so nothing changed).so yeah, ebank is made in vb.net despite how much people tell me i sux for being the reason that we didn't use c#.however, ix forrez, lisa, xb95 and others from the #eve-dev channel on coldfront soon made me realize the beauty of ruby."
"interesting, i'll be watching."
"issler dainze - csm candiadate - \"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"i just finished replying to the 0.0 thread. i am looking forward to similar opportunities to provide the pilots of eve (i am now going to just say poe) a chance to see how each of the csm candidates thinks about what matters most to the voters. i encourage folks to post a question or series of questions here in this forum and ask us all to respond. i expect you could learn just what to expect from us if you do choose to elect us.so bring on those questions! i'll prime the pump. random pilot in eve - \"what do you all think about quafe? do you think ultra is worth the extra isks?\"well, i for one love the citrusy aftertastes of quafe. i also find it to be an excellent solvent and use it regularly to clean my mining lasers. as for ultra, yes, for special occasions i think it warants the extra coin.well, that's it for now, until next time remember, \"stuffs getting better! stuffs getting better every day! \"issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord"

"if you value things like integrity and trust, how do you feel about things like corptheft and scamming in eve?there is a problem, if you've ever run a corporation, you'd understand that if you intend on never been scammed, then running your corporation smoothly, and efficiently is virtually impossible. when corporations like dice can get scammed to the tune of 300bill, you know that it's a little more than a few people lacking sufficient grey matter. my view on it is that you just have to accept that you might get scammed, and when it happens, you can always settle it with dps how do you feel about hisec \"ganking\"?one of the things i love about eve is that there is always a chance when you undock, that you might die, it's one of the things i hope never change. beyond that, i'm not too concerned about where the balanace of power is either way (if it's with the victim or the gankers), as so long as it's possible.what are your views on **********, the developer misconduct, and internal affairs?kugutsu... who??? seriously, i tuned out of the whole t2 ammo spawning bob=dev *scandal*.do you think that eve has in any way diminished in the \"cold dark universe\" aspect in the last five years, and if so, is that a bad thing?eve cannot be a mono chromatic environment, i feel it would be perfectly fine for eve to be a hustling bustling hive of activity in one area, and a dark, cold closed environment in the next. you could argue that the amount of systems that are 'empty', especially in 0.0 has vastly diminished however when i started playing in 2005, the number of pilots online on the main cluster averaged at 17k-25k. obviously, the number of systems hasn't increased much, (drone regions) so naturally the coldness and darkness diminished as well, however travel between systems has been made easier. the main complaint i hear is that this has generally made new eden feel smaller, which is understandable, however, one complaint i've always had about eve is that star systems are far too small. there like rooms, you pass through, there's usually very little interaction, rarely anything in them and when entire corporations require constellations to support their numbers npc requirements to the level of lvl 4 empire missions, you can't but help think that jeez, one man per solar system?? isn't that kinda ******ed???"

"how do you feel about the idea of local chat being moved into delayed mode? what impact do you think it will have in game?"
"hey vilypoo's.there will be nearly 150 titans in the eve universe in a few months. should \"something\" be done about it? (ja oder nein will do)eve is becoming way too (new) player friendly imo (ccp caving in when faced with massive whining and *****ing about something that's not broken). should this be stopped? it is supposed to be a cold harsh universe, not hello kitteeh online."
"i have been wondering around talking to people on vent and ts servers and decided that i should do it more often.if any people/corps would like to speak to me regarding the csm election , ask question, express opinions or just have a chat i will be more than willing to oblige. contact me ingame ( send an eve mail to promithius) and we can arrange something from there.after all communication is the most important aspect of the csm.if you are unable to use ts or vent feel free to post questions and the like on this thread."
"in response to this and this, i feel i should make my position clear. i'm not sure how many of you have read the eve novel or follow the eve backstory but those of you who have/do will know that the caldari have elected a petty, vicious madman as their leader, have squads of armed thugs who wander the streets beating up ethnic minorities, they have threatened genocide as a blackmail tactic and have perfomed terrorist activites against their own people as a means of triggering war.i don't like that. i don't like that at all. now maybe it's politically incorrect for me to express my dislike for a different culture. i'm certain within the scope of eve its possible to infer that as racism but i truly believe the actions of the caldari state are detestable. this has no bearing on any caldari pilot (after all no-one can help what or where they were born) but the in-game caldari state is a terrible thing and i will not hide my dislike for it.if that is a factor that infulences your csm voting then i apoligise but the issue was raised and i felt obliged to respond."
"in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?i wouldn't encourage any adjustments to player and alliance income in 0.0 because it might throw things out of balance. we must remember that 0.0 is meant to reward the player(s) who are willing to take the risks to be out there. if you put up a pos in a 0.0 system to rat/mine from it, yes it'll generate more wealth than doing it anywhere in empire. however you might lose that pos to a hostile force and as a result all the isk you've invested in it. risk versus reward. how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?this will depend on what ccp adds or removes at this point. what improvements would you like to see in 0.0 as an endgame, things to reward players for having \"made it.\"0.0 space doesn't need to be any wealthier, for starters. the only real reward i can see is some adjustments to the sovereignty mechanic and pos warfare. ccp has made some progress on handling the lag in large battles but they need to continue remedying that situation. nothing (in my opinion) frustrates a player more than being stuck in unplayable lag situations as the battle rages around them. the addition of station/gate defenses in sov 4 systems would be nice too, as a \"reward\".how would you raise the status of 0.0 in a productive way to enrich the game?there is no real way to \"raise the status\" as i see it. 0.0 is called zero point zero for a reason. there is no concord out there to protect you or security hits to dissuade someone from attacking you. you have you rely upon your own cunning, allies, and luck to survive out there and prosper. are you in favor of any role separation or gap-filling with regard to the infrastructure of 0.0? (in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roles)things appear to be pretty well covered. the only thing i can think of at this moment is a boost to the black ops ships and their ability to do covert cynos and bridges.changes to any capitals or sub-caps in context of healthier 0.0?perhaps a change to the titan doomsday, in that it gives an adverse status effect (webbed/sensor damped/cap neutralized for x amount of time) to all ships present rather than cause damage. that would be more forgiving in a lagged situation than losing your ship outright. plus it would promote a real conclusion to the fight where everyone contributes, not just the titan pilot. this is something i plan to expand upon in my blog this week at www.avalloc.netany other comments in areas not covered by the questions?the ui needs to be expanded in terms to the overview filters. the ability to have incapped/offline pos modules vanish from overview would help for sieges. the opposite goes for people repping a pos too because having to lock a module to see if it has been repped adds an unnecessary step especially when you have brackets turned off. another addition to ui would be percentages on shield/armor/hull that you have locked. that way you know exactly what the pos has for remaining shield health."
"issler dainze - csm candidate - \"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"1. in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?there are huge income opportunities in 0.0 already. it is the mechanics of getting the wealth out this is the issue.2. how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?0.0 should be the hardest and most rewarding place in eve. there should be more about it that is special. 0.0 deserves to be more exotic than just high sec with no concord. there should be things i can see there or do there that i can't find anywhere else.3. what improvements would you like to see in 0.0 as an endgame, things to reward players for having \"made it.\"i refuse to accept the concept of the eve endgame. i do accept however that the most challenging experiences in eve should live in 0.0. if there is one single thing i can think of that i beleve is wrong about 0.0 it is that currently 0.0 is biased dramatically towards large corps or alliances. somehow 0.0 needs to be made more accessable to smaller groups and individuals. think about the stories of the wild west (which is how i think of 0.0). the lone gunman, or the small band of gunfighters. hard for them to survive in 0.0 at the moment.4. how would you raise the status of 0.0 in a productive way to enrich the game?0.0 needs to be more exotic. if you choose to go there you should have experiences that can't be found anywhere else. every 0.0 area should have something unique about it. an ore, a mob, an npc or a spacial characteristic.5. are you in favor of any role separation or gap-filling with regard to the infrastructure of 0.0? (in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roles)if i understand the question, yes. there needs to be a way for a smaller corporation or alliance to create a safer way to get back and forth from empire to the badlands. somethink like a smaller jump gate that would be allowed to create a path between low sec and 0.0 without sov. restrict it so it is only useful for industry and not combat (this is just a thought, i would want to think about how this would work some more)6. changes to any capitals or sub-caps in context of healthier 0.0?a blockade runner that could beat a bubble camp? a capital ship that can function like a mobile trade hub? lots of things that could be done.7. other comments.i think low sec is even more \"broken\" than 0.0. there is no doubt that there should be a clear linear relationship for risk and reward as a pilot leaves high sec for low sec and eventually the badlands. not only should the risks be a linear increase, the rewards should be as well. also there needs to be more than valuable drops and exotic ores as you descend in security status, there needs to be interesting things as well. i should want to go there for more than the balance of my wallet or the lack of security. there should be unique things to see there.8. how would you make 0.0 cooler?aliens!remember \"stuffs getting better! stuffs getting better every day!\"issler daizecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord"
"1. in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?i don't think there is necessarily anything wrong with 0.0 income, more the way it is generated. i would love to see ccp look at possibly introducing planetary interaction, both of planets involved in the mining of materials as well as creating/trading of trade goods. drug manufacturing definitely needs to be looked at as at the moment it's generally underused/underutilised/a pain the ass to do, exploration definitely needs to be looked at to be more interactive (continuous exploration via waypoints similar to missions/complexes would be great), mission running in 0.0 instead of high/low-sec should be made more enticing (by nerfing high or buffing 0.0 i'm just not sure). allowing (and making it worthwhile) to have the creation of semi-permanent infrastructure that allows people to actually have a sense of ownership of the space and are developing it rather than just plonking down some towers and an outpost and claiming sov is also high on my list of wants.2. how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?ties into q1. 3. what improvements would you like to see in 0.0 as an endgame, things to reward players for having \"made it.\"again see q14. how would you raise the status of 0.0 in a productive way to enrich the game?i'm not sure it needs it's status raised. it's supposed to be lawless space controlled by whoever has the most/biggest guns.5. are you in favour of any role separation or gap-filling with regard to the infrastructure of 0.0? (in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roles)not from a ship point of view, but specialised mining pos or planetary colonising/harvesting structures would be cool.6. changes to any capitals or sub-caps in context of healthier 0.0?i believe the cap/super-caps are being looked at by ccp already so that they become more role specific rather than swiss army knives. black ops cyno's should be able to be created even in cyno-jammed systems.7. any other comments in areas not covered by the questions?nope * how would you make 0.0 cooler?more ice belts? (see what i did there?)"
"first, thanks for your questions.first, i believe the income one can generate from 0.0 is actually potentially adequate as it is. the rats are best in 0.0, the exploration content is best, the minerals are best there too. of those things, only mining has become unprofitable. in order to increase 0.0 income, one has to work on removing the aspects that unbalanced it in the first place. mostly, in my opinion, that's all the automated mining that occurs in lowsec or highsec. 0.0 is, and has always been a dangerous part of the game. operating in 0.0 implies more risk, more rewards (and more fun!). as long as ccp keeps introducing features pertaining to 0.0 in addition to that added to highsec, 0.0 should still be operatable.now the idea behind how 0.0 should operate is fine, the mechanics are just plain wrong though. pos warfare is dull and limited to cap pilots, leaving the others in the dust. sovereignty mechanics are terribly broken and limited to pos spamming, leaving large swaths of sovereign space actually empty. in order for 0.0 to become interesting for a larger number of people, the barrier of entry has to be lowered without nullifying the investment of those already present.in order for 0.0 to remain the \"endgame region\" of the universe, things have to remain challenging. as things are, things are either not challenging and repetitive (large alliance warfare) or too challenging (for smaller alliances). reworking the sovereignty mechanics, altering the nature of pos warfare and decreasing the immense logistic needs associated with those activities will go a long way towards making 0.0 more interesting to a lot of people, thereby making it more interesting for everyone. i believe focusing on the addition of new content in 0.0 at this stage to be a wrong idea. fixing what's already there should be the priority.see previous answers. 0.0 could also use some variety, if only cosmetic, to differentiate it from the rest of the universe. if you're talking about pos/outposts, then the answer is no. fix these ones in the first place.i believe the capital ships fill their roles pretty well as it is. some of them could use some balancing (naglfar comes to mind, most skill intensive, worst in terms of dps and tank). i believe the nano-nerf will go a long way towards diversifying the smaller fleet that are seen roaming in 0.0. i will miss my vaga for sure in its current form, but there's more to gain from a diverse ship make-up in fleet, leading to more tactics and less blobing.no. i'll summarize my priorities for 0.0:- modify pos warfare so as to make it enjoyable for everyone, including non cap pilots. multiple objectives of a non \"bring dreads and blow everything up\" nature for instance.- modify sovereignty mechanics. make it harder to control large swaths of space and easier to control smaller parts.- make smaller gangs viable.- ease pos logistics need.get rid of uniform star backgrounds that look like lowsec would be nice :pmeissa"
"hello all,i have a good deal of experience in 0.0 and alliances, but not as much as the big boys in the alliances. let me answer these as best i can.> in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?my webpage describes some ideas i have for ore diversification, and more npc agents in 0.0 couldn't hurt. ore could stand to stretch out, the pirates could have a much bigger presence in 0.0, and some corps, such as soe, could spread out more too.> how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?more pipes are necessary, including more direct jumps into 0.0 from high-sec.> what improvements would you like to see in 0.0 as an endgame, things to reward players for having \"made it.\"have conquered outposts require repairs before becoming active again, since it is easier to take over an outpost than it is to build a new one, even when the outposts are cheap to start out with (alliance-wise)> how would you raise the status of 0.0 in a productive way to enrich the game?the guns around gates and outposts is an idea i've had for some time, and would like to see it discussed deeper until all the bugs are worked out, then finally implimented if a good agreement can be reached.> are you in favor of any role separation or gap-filling with regard to the infrastructure of 0.0? (in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roles)sovereignty should mean more, such as the gate guns and other concepts. maybe a way to open up sovereignty of an area which will allow others to rat and such, but still maintain relations. perhaps a whole other system security concept, where player-based security can be founded and raised to a good level and will have benefits without affecting the rat population.> changes to any capitals or sub-caps in context of healthier 0.0?supercapital ships are too easy to take out, imho. they should be a massive mobile station to reward those who eventually achieve the skills and resources to fly one (including reprocessing, fully-active clone bays, corp hangars, etc).> any other comments in areas not covered by the questions?i'm gonna put on my fireproof suit now, but i don't think you should be able to lose or gain security standing from 0.0. the benefits are already there, and that will require people to enter low-sec (making it more of a contested area) to raise their security status. now, pirates simply make a quick jaunt to 0.0 and they're back in the positives in no time.also, npcs should not drop basic modules, but only named ones. to compensate, their bounty can be increased by 10% (except for commander spawns), and this will improve the whole game (mining will be more necessary when coupled with ore distribution, mission runners will have more liquid assets due to the 10% bonus without worrying about reprocessing, etc)."
"how do you define which tactics are legitimate and which are not? after all, it's not especially kind to blow up another player's hard-earned ship, and not particularly fair that you can be set back in skill training just because somebody podded you. what is \"too unfair\" to be allowed into the game? in what way should games aim for realism, and in what ways should they try to break it - not just in the sense of game mechanics, but also in the sense of acceptable actions and cultural norms? and most importantly, why is your answer to these questions so obviously correct that is should be used as a rationale to ban violators?"
"your anti-scamming ideas are as dumb as they are unworkable, even if you had the power to implement such promises, which you don't. let's say one of the eve banks collapses tomorrow - was it a scam or just neglect/bad luck? are we going to have jury trials for big scams? maybe they could keep their account if they pass a polygraph. i've never scammed anyone and never will but scamming adds colour and real risk to the universe. if you prefer a nice theme park ride of an mmo where nothing ever bad really happens there are plenty of other games that cater for that preference."
"ccp has measures in place to prevent all employees from doing exactly what you're worried about. this came as a result of the whole \"t20 incident\" and is why they have their own internal affairs department. therefore anytime a command if executed in-game that would \"create something\" a log is generated and ia follows up on it if they weren't informed prior to its use. they have said this much concerning the matter. eve online is a truly spectacular game in its whole sandbox attitude. at any given moment control of a region can change hands. the very economy can be influenced too from jita as the past has demonstrated, an example being someone buying all the sales of a specific resource and reselling at a much higher markup. the employees of ccp need to play the game and be aware of any/all of the issues first hand. any attempt to ban them from player corporations will only serve to isolate them. of course they shouldn't advertise that they work for ccp and players shouldn't witch hunt them to find ccp employees in their corps. respect their privacy."
"your opinions on banning scamming and banning people for \"corporate theft\" have got to be some of the most pathetic and misguided opinions i have ever heard, and i can't believe anyone is actually thinking they can run on such idiocy."
"you have to scam someone or theive from your corp.there is no way to not perform one of these actions.which one do you do, and why?"
"yes. stupidity should always be painful and penalized."
"lovely, tell me exactly what you don't like about the ideas rather then insulting me with personal attacks."
"how long ago did you buy this character, and who's your original character/main."
"the character was bought on 2008.08.17 and main is mitsuko watanabe birth: 2008.07.13 and i operate in 0.0 space since around 2008.07.25"
"the stupidity of your suggestions warrant not bothering to explain anything, because anyone worth talking to would understand already, but i digress. it's an idiotic position primarily because you would have gms tied up dealing with whiny petitions by babies who could not properly organize and lock down their assets, claiming \"so and so stole my stuff\" every time they decided someone had something they weren't supposed to have.it's not your, or the gms positions to mediate every dispute, banning people who take things that they can take. any ceo or individual with an ounce of intelligence does not leave things around for people to steal, and is aware that items that are open to be taken can be taken. saying that you would \"ban\" people from a game because they don't behave like nice guys and because you're too inept to know who to trust is ridiculous."
"how did you get the isk to buy this character?"
"gtc trading and a small portion rating."
"people shooting at each other and blowing up their ships and escape pods is perfectly fine, but theft is terrible and we must take steps to ban it!ahahahaha get the hell out of this game you dumb pubbie"
"stopped reading after the boldened part. i suggest you go back playing hello kitteeh online and take your \"bright\" ideas and opinions with you."
"lol 'trading'? the term you're looking for is buying isk.nice one."
"still waiting on further clarification regarding questions i've asked you. if you're not going to answer, at least have the courtesy to inform me so."
"none of both. if i am required to do one of both actions to proceed in the game i would quit.this is not they way i play and this is not the way i live. never."
"i am sorry for the late response. anyway, internal affairs, as far as i know is an ccp internal department. but something like that should be done by a neutral outside source, to be credible."
"if you say so, but this kind of isk acquisition is legit, because i get isk and the other guy/girl gets playtime."
"you still haven't answered my questions. it was a hypothetical situation. that's in direct contravention to what you said above. one of ia's main tasks is to ensure that devs do not abuse their powers while playing the game normally - i.e., the assumption is that devs playing is fine, and uses of dev powers can be monitored and abuses prevented. if you think this is an agency that should exist, whether it be internal or external, you are presumably accepting the idea that its mission is a valid one - i.e., that monitoring devs in their play is sufficient to prevent abuses. given that this is the exact opposite of your thread title, how do you reconcile this?"
"sorry for my late respons to your questions.if your ship is blown to dust in low-secs or 0.0, you took the risk willingly. if your ship is blown up in high-sec because of an ongoing war, you could have avoided it. but if you<U+FFFD>re getting knocked out in high-sec by suicide gankers, it<U+FFFD>s unfair, but a risk you have to accept. except that the consequences for high-sec pirats should be greater. like faster loose of security standing, unability to loot a destroyed ship with an alt or a security status that can drop even lower then -10 and that would take longer to get back to a normal level. high-sec should be, after all,more like a \"more or less\" safe haven and loosing your skillpoints in high-sec should be removed. but again, if you enter low-sec or 0.0, you<U+FFFD>re accepting that risk.spying and theft inside a corp isn<U+FFFD>t acceptable for me, as is scamming. even if some player view this as legit. i don<U+FFFD>t. this is where realism should end and gameplay should be fun. i like realistic games, but what use does realism has, if it stands in the way of most players fun. some players view spying, scamming, stealing as fun, but i don<U+FFFD>t. spying playes even greater with emotions of players involved. they work with the spy, start to trust him and then all of a sudden, he betrayes them. real-life spies have to face the concequences of their doing, so should in game spies. real life spies=death eve spies=ban.i see no contradiction here. simply because i agree that there should be a department that monitors the staff activity, doesn<U+FFFD>t mean that i don<U+FFFD>t want ccp out of player corps.staff members are still able to abuse their power, even if they are not in a player corp."
"im not sure if you've read all the responses above this post but that pretty much exactly what the ia department means. now maybe they can inform on exacly how some formulas work and drop probability but that stuff gets pretty well spaded and the wiki tells everyone. realisitcally a well read wiki using eve player would be more sucessful than someone who uses no other source of info other than a dev corpmate.plus honestly, most ccp employees are in marketing, managment, support or whitewolf employees. programmers are a very small percentage. i see no benefit is stopping those people from playing. i mean what info can they leek that you couldnt find on the forums in a few days anyway*?*no offence guys, you do a great job but i don't see you 'hax0ring teh gibson' :)"
"reposting this so there's no ambiguity.i have a hypothetical situation for you:you must either scam someone or steal from your corp.you must pick one of these two options, there is no way out.which one would you pick?why?"
"yeah, it sucks having to do an overhaul, but the current pos setup is just plain ugly, laggy, and a complicated mess. fire-bomb it and start over."
"this issue was escalated by the csm in meeting 11 and will be passed to ccp for consideration.fingers crossed it gives the devs some food for thought!"
"no he's right, with faction damage mods and a faction co-proc (about another ~200mil in gear) you can shove a dcii as well. you can also drop two faction gyro's for t2 and use a 3% cpu implant. you still need a cpu mod to fit a shield tank, your damage is still subpar, and your tank is ridiculously cap unstable but it is marginally better. i just don't think you should require a capital to spend millions more on an already crappy ship to make it marginally less subpar."
"i agree with you on the faction mods, and that's comparing apples to oranges. compare other dreads fitted with faction mods, naglfar doesn't shine again. right on! + more training time.prop goes to you for starting this great thread."
"i was only able to take part in a few minor events as these were (usually) ran while i was asleep in bed but those few events were always interesting and enjoyable to be a part of.one of my favorites was simply joining an ad-hoc gang to escort a freighter across a dozen jumps to deter any attack from the competition of the freighter pilot. in the end, the only thing the event actors fired at each other were words but it was fun to do it all the same. i think i got a few thousand units of electronic parts in payment for my time, nothing fancy.there were a few others and they always (at least for me) helped build up the living, breathing world of eve. i was very sorry to see the aurora shut down and while the coronation video was quite an impressive bit of work, i too would have liked to see a great deal more interaction with the customer base over a short flick."
"it certainly sounds like something that would breath life into eve and i'm all for that. it would certainly provide greater immersion"
"yes, it would be nice, but think about the event you remember so fondly and add a 400 man goonswarm or privateers gang coming to crash the party, with capitals and all. what would have been the result? something memorable or a hated massacre without any story?how many people was really there in elarel? 100 players? the number of players present in the server has killed that kind of events. then there is the people that will scream \"cheating\" every time they are not the one getting some profit from the event. even if no one was getting any profit from the event. ccp don't want the bad publicity of those wild accusation has sometime in the past they had reason to be so some people will take them for real forever. so in the end ccp will go for very bland events for now and i doubt it will change in the foreseeable future. sad as it would be nice. still, supported for future developement."
"i agree on his arguments, and his sentiment."
"yes, i do certainly see the issue with a particular large event drawing hundreds of players to empire/lowsec wherever of course, but then there are remedies. take the goons for example - if they come en-masse to empire to disrupt an event that means they are in empire and open to attack from the people maintaining wardecs against them. if you tell me there are going to be a couple of hundred goons in x system i'd be inclined to wardec them myself just for the free kills also, (beyond the realm of player counter-intervention) there is the empire sanction - and thats something ccp have toyed with in the past (going so far as issuing threats in the name of npc factions) but never so far actually doing it. i see no reason why you can't have the amarrian empire staging a coronation for their empress and making it explicit in the publicity material that any corporation or alliance attempting to disrupt the event would face punitive sanctions that could involve global standings setting against the organization, temp flagging to faction police, temp docking restrictions - anything like that. and in this way the universe can become more real. want try to suicide gank the sarum heir on her coronation as empress? sure press the button and take the consequences - and those consequences will hit you and those you associate with. yep this will take an events team with the absolute trust of the player base to administrate - but if all event plotlines, assets, and potential consequences are audited by internal affairs then i have no trouble trusting it will be fair and extremely good for the game.+ of course, ccp have worked a wonder getting jita to work properly on a sunday evening - i suspect event fights won't be quite up to the scale of bob vs nc cap slugfests in 0.0.yeah ultimately though - \"its a headache for ccp\" ain't reason enough for us not to ask for a return to excellent live events that make the game environment feel real and help remind us why eve is a singular achievement in the mmorpg landscape. dare to dream is my alliance motto and to be honest it should be eve's motto too - these crazy icelanders have got it in them to do beautiful reckless insane things with the mmorpg paradigm and i for one want to persuade them to keep taking risks, keep pushing the envelope, keep fresh and never grow old. i hate the idea of eve becoming part of the mmorpg mainstream of canned mediocrity and on this issue i think its high time we played our part in raging against the dying of the light."
"when myself and jade agree on something, you know that it's important and that it makes sense.bring back live events."
"this is a jade wall of text that i can actually swallow with ease and agree on. i really miss the live events that used to occur in this game. giant thumbs up from me."
"i approve of this. the empyrean age buildup and plotline was just begging for ingame events, the lack of them took away from the whole idea imho.hopefully next time they try a big plot we will be able to take part more than just within the forums."

"to quote \"smash tv\"\"i love it!!\" (always sounded like \"lyle lovett!\" to me)"
"one of the ironies is that eve: the empyrean age, the entire recent eve storyline and many, many aspects of eve as it is today simply would not be what they are and have been were it not for player events. the novel would be an entirely different book had a certain player event gone another way, and arguably other player events inform the very background of happenings in the eve universe that make that book and the storyline it is integrated with what they are.one of my differences with the many people that bemoan the current storyline is the idea that it is entirely driven by the whim of the writers with no reference whatever to player action in the eve universe. at present, that is, in my view, manifestly false.but there is certainly something to claims that in the future the storyline will have no rootedness in player action except for the dim and distant memories of events in the history of eve that happened as they did because of player action.the reason for this is that there are no longer any significant ways in which players can interact with the storyline. there is no way that players can even alter the manner in which an event plays out. ultimately, major events will, it has to be accepted, likely turn out in the end as the storyline devs wish them too. one way or another. but the realisation that has seeped into the souls of many a roleplayer in eve currently is that not even the details of how the story plays out can realistically be altered or informed by player action.this is one of the reasons for the paradox of the vastly increased output in eve news items, produced by the manifest hard work of writers who are both devs and volunteers, having, i would have to say, less impact and resonance than the occasional pieces of yesteryear. in part it is also a phenomenon of the increased output being pumped through a news system that is barely fit for purpose when reams of quality material are being put out daily. blink and you miss it.but it is largely also the strong sensation among many players, new and old, that the news is moving wallpaper. the real stories are their own. they will continue to make them. that, i think, was never in doubt. but it is to the sadness of many that their stories, largely, are no longer part of the greater story of the eve background. or perhaps better to say, no longer felt to be part of that greater story.factional warfare has been a grand success in many ways. it has invigorated roleplay and immersion, if you like, in a way that i actually would argue was not anticipated by many. it is however, not without its flaws, and it has also, thus far, not met the challenge of filling that gap between player interaction and the storyline. perhaps it will. perhaps with some events framework alongside it, it will be the answer, particularly when it is widened to involve many more factions than the 'big four'.one way or another, though, what the best of eve events stood for, and i see no big reason to linger over the nonsenses and mis-steps that did occasionally occur with events, has in some sense been lost. maybe this was always inevitable given recent history in terms of the development of the game. like jade, and others, however, i think the time has come for ccp to shrug off the chaff of the past and bring back the real substance that well-managed events can add to a game like eve.i know they are capable of it and i also feel that deep-down they want to do it. our duty, yes duty, as players is to impress on them that we want it too.support this call.cosmo"
"completly support this. i remember being bright eyed and new when i was in ushra'khan and we'd be called in to \"liberate\" some slaves from a convoy. i remember how hectic it was trying to find said convoy, get the slaves then chase down or block off anyone that was trying to interfere. *player or otherwise*"
"i agree. i still remember one simple little event that i stumbled upon.i miss those events."
"supporting this!"
"/signed"
"/signed"
"i thoroughly agree with you jade."
"totally agreed. we need more live events, more ways which we as players can influence the storylines - or perhaps a way for us to believe that the storylines are a refection of whats really happening in game?"
"i'll just say hell yeah and read the fine print later.did one aurora event and found it fun so"
"i completely agree with bringing back live events.i came to eve late, so i've never experienced a live event. it seems as if ccp has been focusing on scripts to appease the mission runners, and then letting the sandbox mechanics take care of player interaction.i want to see more events where the conclusion is unexpected by everyone involved. the unpredictability of eve online is what makes it so amazing, and i think it's time that ccp involved itself in the process again."
"yes.it would be nice to see events that also tie into faction warfare. a constantly changing set of events would give me a reason to play eve until the hamsters died of old age."
"i am not really a person who participates in events, but they do seem to be important to many players, and they do add immensely to the game's back story which is something i appreciate. supported."
"nothing engages players or makes a game seem as involved as having the opportunity to influence the very back story the game is based on. embracing this idea and making it work would take eve even more strides ahead of other games."
"a firm 'yes' to this one from me, someone who, unfortunately, never got to experience any of these epic moments except by second-hand reports, largely due to me being unaware of the rp side of the game.i remember talking to my first ever ceo as he regaled us with stories of the battle for crielere and just how damn amazing it sounded. sure, he said there was lag, he lost his ship (a pricey - at the time - megathron), he missed out on loot drops but they were all of minimal note against the fun he had. emphasis there is obviously on the 'fun' aspect.the feeling i got from these people who'd been there and done it was that, by and large, it didn't matter if there were shiny loot drops, it didn't matter that they lost ships, because they felt they were doing something that was directly involved with the backstory.i'd like to see those days again.of course there are things to workaround (eve's got a whole lot bigger, for a start), but none of those problems are insurmountable and, in my opinion, they're thoroughly worth every ounce of effort.solid 'yes'."
"i would support this concept, but with the understanding that the events would be integrated into existing game mechanics, rather than competing with them."
"i want this a lot."
"my own thoughts are already posted here but for the sake of a concise thread i'll quote myself.strip away all rewards, have the actors ships drop no loot. make it 100% about narrative and no finanicial aspects to an event what so ever. but let new eden breathe again."
"hardly a day goes by that i wish that i joined earlier so that i could have participated in such events. i would have to say that this has to be done right, not necessarily soon. give it a year or two run up, try various things in test servers. any movement on this topic would give some people i know who left the game over time a very good reason to come back.i would love to see this thing come again, even in a more modest scope."
"while i do wish ccp would bring back the events from before, they do need to do it somewhat differently than they did it before to make sure there is no appearance of favoritism or railroading, as there has been in the past. there also needs to be realistic consequences for people who take part in these events -- standings changes, etc -- and these consequences have to have a real game effect. if you have -5 standings with the federation, why can you dock in fed navy stations (assuming you can get to them)? if you have +9 standings with the guristas, why do they shoot at you all the time anyway?i elaborated on what i think needs to happen before aurora or something like it can come back in jade's thread on shc, so i won't go back into it here, but as far as the idea of bringing them back period? yes, i really miss the players taking part in the story -- or even feeling like they are in the same setting as the background storyline, something that seems to be sadly lacking now."
"this is probably one of my biggest concerns with eve today. i miss the old style events."
"amazing!in less than 2 weeks we have over 6 full \"pages\" of support for this. ccp, please do this yesterday!"
"give skill queue now !"
"still no word on this i take it?"
"seriously ccp, this is bull****. a skill queue is not hard and now that we are literally paying for training time, give it!."
"just want to thank everyone in here for there support."
"the issue was voted on and received support for escalation. so hopefully we will get an answer in a month time or whenever the next csm-ccp session is."
"definately yes. there were a couple of features and ideas discussions about this too, but they get drowned out too quickly"
"after some negotiation i agreed to drop the capital smart bombs element of this proposal from the issue submission and the csm subsequently voted to escalate it for ccp's attention.so more fun with smartbombs it is!"
"im against this poorly thought out nerf."
"i never played back in those days but from what i understand eve is an entirely different game than it used to be. new corporations and alliances don't stand a chance at entering 0.0 as it is mostly claimed by money making logistically soul draining pos's. capitals are way out of line with the general scale of ships. the game has become boring to me unless i have just picked up a new ship to test out."
"some ideas:- temporary space distortions aka. \"space weather\". they \"move\" over whole universe and prevent pilots in random constellations from using jump portals/cynos.- mobile space distortion generator, can deflect/bypass a capital jump. probablyvery hard to balance, but you got the idea.- free exotic dancers for every 100th gate jump :)"
"one of the reasons why the \"i used to do roaming bs gangs in 2004\" comments are not relevant to the current speed nerf discussion. the ease of logistics both to/from and within 0.0 space is one of the major problems of 0.0 atm. but sadly i dont think its possible to solve it without alienating a large part of the eve population."
"supporting this. its an important topic that definitely needs to be addressed by the csm and ccp. i hope we get to raise these issues in the last session of the current csm and fingers crossed tusko gets to carry them forward into the next."
"what youd escribe soudns much more fun than current crap mechanics, too bad i couldn't enjoy it.more freighter ganking plz."
"yes! yes! yes! when will ccp do something about this?obviously a need.obviously desired.obviously helpful.obviously ccp is badly managed. this is not exactly on topic, but i just gotta add that i heard a speech on ted.org by a guy named charles leadbeater (look it up). the guy talked about some game designer in china with 9000 servers, 250 million (yep, you read it right: million) players and at any one time 4 million of them are online!!!! and the guy only has 500 employees.the reason for so much loyalty: the customers create content. its a democracy. people want to be involved in the things they love.how many people play eve at any one time: 30,000-40,000. how much say do we get in the game: very little. ccp is not a democracy - kinda like the us. (lol) ccp: listen to your customers."
"just to clarify....... look into...= talk about it but no commitment to take action in any way.likely = a solid maybe... in the future.= a timeframe of infinite value. 10 years from now and tomorrow are both \"in the future\".to put it all together...we promise only to discuss it. but we might do something about it before eveonline fails as a commercially viable mmo but we are not actually commiting to doing anything, just that we might do something someday.now i am convinced that they listen to the player base and that the csm really have an impact on the game in any form. i can't see how anyone could deny either of these points given the solid results shown here.so if everyone will please stop referring to the csm program as an \"ineffective paperthin drama show put on to somehow prove that ccp is responsive to the needs and wishes of the playerbase\" we can get on with paying our subscription fees and feeling warm inside, though a bit poorer.how can you detractors be so blind?the proof is right here!thank god (or budda or sheep or whatever you flavor of divinity is) for csm and ccp for listening and implementing these ideas in a timely fashion.oh wait..."
"yuuuuus!! drone implants ftw!"
"oh, yes please! can't have them not giving us an alliance tourney this winter!"
"after reading greyscale's blog earlier today, it came to light just how inappropriate ccp's thinking to resolving the scarcity of moon resources is in relation to the game. there were so many better solutions, that i've read a lot of the ideas and through my experience of 0.0 and alliance politics as well, i have come up with this solution.moon spawns (pdf)please read the entire document before coming to your conclusions. obviously it's not perfect, but imo it's a much better idea than what's been proposed before."
"adding the thumbs up"
"seems interesting, however this idea would be vetoed against the fact that moons are static assets and cannot be fundamentally \"destroyed\" in the eve universe. (case in point, look at how ccp said 'no' to the destroyable outposts idea). besides, once a moon has exploded what is going to replace it? sorry i didnt have enough time to read more in depth due to time constraints (ill check again later), however a more competing idea would be to introduce moons with mineral \"veins\" that can be exploited, similar how to current real mining operations operate. they keep digging deeper and deeper following the mineral vein they want until it vanishes and the mine goes empty or they explore and find another vein (likely). i think this was similar to abrazzar's idea, but in any case it lets you know of a fixed quantity available discovered on the moon, and once depleted you have to rescan. chances are good you will find another vein, but in the mean time there should be other types of minerals available to mine at that moon (no moon should just have one mineral type) and operations would just shift dynamically."
"yeah you didn't read it entirely. it gets respawned next dt and another moon in a 3-5 constellation area (dependent on whether it's inner or outer 0.0) becomes the prize moon, which has to be re-prospected.and instead of having the veins as you said, a pos fires 1 to 4 probes per hour continuously at the moon which controls the abundance of the moon goo."
"i like your moon redistribution idea, i think it could be mentioned to ccp. it is the kind of \"visionary\" stuff ccp keeps asking for. i agree with manford tho, that the disappearance and respawning of moons might be technically difficult, as they are static resources in game... e.g. galaxy updates (systems, jumpgates, planets, moons, stations) are static as far as i know, not something that is downloaded every time you enter a system. but this should not block your idea from proceeding tho, the technical feasibility of issues is not for the csm to decide."
"sorry to say, but the proposed ideas no good at all. it makes things just complicated beyond imagination without any benefit at all.it would mean a huge effort and with such an effort i think we could expect a much better result.and well, the argument that this proposal is better than the current presented by greyscale is a weak argument because the greyscale-blog is presenting no good ideas at all.instead there should be a semi-random fuzzy set of all moon minerals available at every moon. a semi-random distribution over all minerals with a sharp peak in the distribution at the currently existing material. the distribution would have random elements, but also some pre-defined distributions based on the rarity of materials. this way you would reach an equilibrium of prices while the valuable moons would still stay valuable!"
"you can't expect everything to be served on a platter. the idea was more born out of making prospecting a more important profession, using exploration as a basis point. no one has really too much to complain about exploration, so really it's no less complicated than that anyway.in my proposal, there is only a limited increase in the amount of moons, but the spread across the galaxy is much more even, fairer and controllable than it is now, thus making no particular 0.0 region any 'better' than another. equally because moons do go boom and respawn, if ccp feel the need to seed more moons, it's a simple change to implement, and thus supply is increased.in all when writing the proposal, i speak as a member of an 0.0 holding alliance, a t2 bpo owner, inventor and pos chain manager, so i'm looking at it from all aspects of the t2 game. a fairer, richer and more controlled moon distribution is definitely required.the point was that if this is the kind of idea ccp has about solving the t2 market, they need *a lot* of help!this is interesting, however, moon goo is supposed to come from the allied faction. for example gallente use cobalt and cobalt is available in minmatar space. your idea of the distribution creates too much obfuscation between the various quadrants of 0.0. however both ideas are similar in that when a moon respawns, they will have a different distribution anyway..."
"i don't much care for the 'income redistribution' effect - all regions are not created equal. even if you normalize moon minerals across a given area, you haven't normalized regional shapes, local rats, pre-existing infrastructure, asteroid belts, exploration, or truesec distribution...so why bother?furthermore, i don't see a significant benefit to your idea over than any of the standard moon cycling plans - ie, some/all minerals just shift around every few weeks, new veins discovered in some places while others peter out. both still share a lot of needless probing, and the only significant positive out of it for alliances is that they can 'overheat' the production - but i think there are better ways to do that as well"
"hello my fellow eve piloti love probing after ships very much,its cheap and a lot of fun,but i have a problem finding something to jump on or giving my mates something to warp on top.why?cause most are \"clever enough\" to fit cloaks,so what has that to do with me?well...structures and site/statics will move not that much and are no challenge for me.i feel kinda useless spending much time in that ship and not finding anyone to play with,no matter if blue,red or neutral.its about interacting with ppl,no matter if you love probing or hate it.i am that bored,i started probing t2 drones to collect them,don`t have to tell that my scanningwindow looked like a chrismastree,that was in highsec...i dont want to talk ratters or altscouts here ,cause they are kinda sitting or playing on the same server or do they?solution:make/reward all those pilots who have all probingskills at 5 able to find \"non\" cloakers via a probe.mebby that way we make probing ,scouting a real and true profsession.that way we are able to bring more depth and tactics into each pilots life,stimulating highsec/lowsec as well as 0.0.have to admit that this whould be radical,cold dark and harshand at the same time lots or fun for you and me.flame on"
"there have been quite a few threads about nerfing cloaks in some way or another. zulupark has commented on this issue in his forum post:"
"that means quite nothing,what about finding solutionsbut thank you for giving me heads up anyway,you dont probe do you ?"
"i do. my favourit ship is the scimitar and its fitted by a recon probe launcher by default."
"well i think all will agree that the cost to make a war dec is low. 2 or 3 mil wathever is pocket change if your a player with 10mil sp. more variations should be there. one thing i didn't see suggested from all the \"obvious\" solutions is make the cost of wardecs related to the security rating.it would be a simple system. you choice till which security you want to wardec to apply. war till .5 sec cheap .6 more expensive and make .8 very expensive option."
"taken from zulupark's q&a session where he answered my question about any proposed changes to empire wardecs"
"thats just your opinion.let face it they claim off ccp that war decleration is this way because of realisme is absolutly bogus. no country will allow corporations killing each other over just by paying the police a small handout.if they would want to add some realisme they bribe of the police force in this case concord should atleast be varly extensive and also related to standing of both corpses with that police force, size of the corporations.i all for having corps wars but paying 2 mil and start an all out war is just plain rediculous. it's not a war from country to country thats factional warefare it's corporations warefare within a legal boundary.to make an comparison it's like paying a hunderd bucks too the police to get a licenses to kill all that have a job at a particular coorporation. the maffia would love it but atleast they know thats never going to happen.and sins there's factional warefare now i also think that with the added pvp options they corporation war declaration should get some work"
"not that it really matters. small corporations have a simple option to counteract a war declarations. just create an executive commander and you have a new corporation for probably about 2 mil or less and you could do this until all possible war declarations are used up. if a small corps plays it smart they corps that tries they war declaration will tire easily. with only 2 accounts you can totally beat war declaring corporation that just are there for griefing around the bush"
"and you've not explained the problem with that. you're locked into the choice you make because that's the character you are. if you made the character with no concern for appearance, why should anything have changed? why should you get to change the fundamentals, race, gender, bloodline, when they already define your virtual character? it doesnt make any sense. you'd get characters who have the attributes of one bloodline and the appearance of another.why destroy all that internal consistency? why make yet another bit of the game that time and effort was spent on, mean nothing? because you think your character will be ugly, without even having tried it. don't be ridiculous, they will never go for this."
"because ccp is changing the rules on how appearances are defined by adding new parts with ambulation.and where did you get the idea that i made this character without any concern for appearance ?sure it wasn't much of a concern because i don't have to look at the portrait. but i still considered it a bit.because the most visible part that they define will be the ambulation avatar. which is the only part where we don't know how our current choices will effect it.unless ccp forces us to change attributes when we change the bloodline for the new avatar so that the attributes do fit with the bloodline. not how i would do it, but it would be an acceptable solution.because ccp is changing the rules on how the characters will look, and how often we have to look at them. currently we don't have to look at our own portraits except on the login screen. but when ambulation comes out, i expect we will have to look at our own characters a lot. which part would that be ?if other mmos are anything to go by, there will be enough people preferring each bloodline to see a fair mix of them around the place.i know that almost everyone will find some bloodlines better looking than others, even while they disagree on which one looks best. unless ccp somehow gets it so that everyone prefers their current bloodline choice, letting people switch will please people better than forcing them to live with a decision they made when they couldn't possibly have all the information needed to make the best choice.by starting on this now, instead of after ambulation comes out, it gives them more time to change and test how it interacts the rest of the ambulation code. meaning more time to fix any bugs that crop up.and it doesn't seem like it the code would be that hard to write. just alter some specific variables stored in known places on the server from one known value to another. possibly resource hungry, but that just means a lag spike for those parts of the cluster after ambulation comes out until most people have used their one free change."
"if you want to change your bloodline, do you want to lose that ridiculous unbalanced achura attribute set though?"
"you wont have to look at it more than once - when they prompt you to re-make your avatar. after that you have plenty of choice not to use ambulation, as they've repeatedly stated its completely optional, with all the existing station functionality available as before.if you do choose to use it, as you seem to be keen on doing, you have to play by the rules, and the rules for ambulation would be that its essentially an immersion-increasing environment. the idea that your bloodline should match what it was a day before the patch seems pretty logical.when you think about it, what is the point of ambulation? really, there isn't one, but the actual aim of it is to add a new level of immersion to stations. its an rp tool, so when you meet someone you can meet face to face. you can pretend to drink in a dirty sleazy space cantina. why on earth would they break that immersion by changing who you are? they've added it so your face becomes more than that, it becomes a persona outside of the ship. your response is to say \"... but in that case i dont want to be me\" - not reasonable. you are you. you are not your ship.lastly, you argument that players did not have all the information at their disposal to make the best choice, is bunkum. plenty of people have invested months of skill training and practice into stuff, much of it unbalanced, only to see it nerfed into the floor. if they had that information at their disposal, would they have made that choice? having to deal with changes is part of the game. getting to make your decisions again and thus making them inconsequential is not."
"nuff said:"
"supporting my own thread, at least we would like to have an answer on this aknowledged problem"
"just a name change? makes sense."
"makes sense"
"ok seeing as every person is talking here about his own experience and not about general info ill try to put this simple.fact 1 why is procurer 1337:procurer costs 2 mil to buyyou get 1.8 mil if you sell it (or fly it to caldari space and sell it there )so you arent buying a procurer you rent it for 200,000.fact 2 why is procurer 1337:next ship in line, retriever costs 6 mil. taking into account you just started eve, dont have 5+ accounts, dont sell your naked pictures fors isk (seen adds), and dont have 600 friends who also play eve that can borow you money, you arent realy in a position to make isk.ibis+bantam+procurer+stripminer+retriever=7 500 000 iskibis+bantam+ ospry + that ship you lost on your 1st mission + random stuff here and there + im gona be ima pvper + retriever = more then 10 milto summarize: lot of people arent pros. lot of people dont have a hauler, lot of people think it better to haul stuff back and forth to the station when your cargobay is full then to can it and pray its there when he gets back. and so for a loot of people procurer is a nice transitional ship. its cheap, you can sell it for almoust as much as you bought it, if you do stupid stuff you can replace it. thats the main argument why this ship is good, and should stay the way it is.p.s. ill repeat:ibis+bantam+procurer+stripminer+retriever=7 500 000 iskibis+bantam+ random ship you flew after bantam + that ship you lost on your 1st mission + random stuff here and there + im gona be imba pvper + retriever = more then 10 milplus not to mention in this kind of situation:short way of learning skills: mining barges 1,2,3,4,5.long way of learning skils: frigat 1,2,3,4,5, mining barge 1,2,3,4,5.all in all if you are going for mining, you need procurer cause you cant farm 6 000 000 in a bantam. p.p.s: prucurer is a minihulk, hulks are imba. i am miniimba :)my experience: i started eve had a trial account poked a lot of stuff trained all kinds of skills. then i bought a normal acount and started ove. and i calculated i want to be a miner. fastest way to get my skills up and money also is to go straight for mining barges. everi other detour just added extra days to what i wanted. i couldent fly anything else then a frigate at start. so i needed a procurer to farm up enough for a retriver."
"not bumping this"
"when i get a dread, the first thing i will do is mine in it...i'll be mining with my carrier too..."
"lol i'm inclined to agree with you but what the hell. chribba is too cool. he has done so much for eve and the devs refuse to recognize him as a super power. vote chribba permanent head of csm!"
"i think that at the very least as it stands right now the csm serves as an advisory council to ccp. one of the things i've been critical to them about is their communication and if it can be taken at face value, we've started to see a lot more of that from ccp. just in the past month we've seen repeated communications about lag, the economy, zulupark's talking about... p. much everything. if nothing else i believe at least some of us involved in the last session helped to contribute to that. one of the things i've been most disappointed in is the challenge created by forming a council with little to no defined purpose, then leaving the council to its own devices to define itself. one thing i'll say about achievement... in order to provide a successful end result one has to have measurable goals to determine achievement. the council was never given any measurable goals, therefore it is difficult to define achievement in a way that can be accepted by any large number of uniquely minded individuals. i can say that it was a success to me and in my opinion. others will share a different opinion depending on how they had perceived things to be. i think that the second council will be a greater success than the first as there will be fewer growing pains, but again having nobody define success leaves everyone to their own judgement on the subject.to be frank i'm of mixed opinion. on one hand i can see that there's a need potentially for some balance, but i am always hesitant to take that at face value because nobody likes to get their stuff blown up, and the cacophony of complaints from the dead isn't ever the greatest way to measure true opinion. on the other hand people like going fast, and interestingly enough small gangs have adapted to speed as a way to be competitive, which will have a negative impact on guerilla warfare. personally, i'd prefer some detailed communication about exactly what changes will be made, in advance. putting some things on sisi does not equal detailing changes and it's no indication whatsoever that any of those changes will actually make it to production. that makes it a moving target.my entire professional career is built around integrity and trust. does it make me less honest in my career if i log into a videogame and take someone's things? does robbing someone in a game make you a terrible person? i don't believe so in the least, and i know many will disagree. to them i'll simply say \"it's a game and those are the rules\". you may think it's unfair in baseball that an audience member can catch a ball preventing the outfielder from doing so and costing a professional team a baseball game. do you then hate the dude who caught the ball? do you hate the ref? do you hate the outfielder? hate baseball? hate rules? no. you accept that those are the established rules and move on. i don't personally engage in any of these pursuits and when i fall victim to them, i think \"man, that sucks\". but i accept them as a part of the game and move on. it's not my place to tell others how to have fun or what to find fun. i'm not the fundie rules police. this is eve online. scamming and corp theft is part of it. if you can't take that then perhaps you're playing the wrong game. i'd recommend finding a new one rather than raging at the game you chose to play."
"if by hisec \"ganking\" you mean \"blowing up someone else's ship in hisec, then i'm all for it. i don't believe there's room in eve for artificial barriers that cater to the sandy crotches of a vocal and lazy minority.kugu is kugu. i think at times his energy's misplaced, but at the end of the day the drama's hysterical, so v0v. if what he's doing is wrong it's certainly not my place to stop it. the developer misconduct was, and i do believe remains a potential problem. i think internal affairs was the right solution. i myself conduct an internal affairs role in my own company. i know it's not easy and it's never perfect. however, i believe that you're much better off with it than without it. people who have in them a real desire to do the wrong thing are going to do it anyway and we have to be careful not to assume that should something negative occur again it's necessarily an abject failure. there's ways to game every single system and it's impossible to be right 100% of the time.yes i do believe it has diminished and i would posit that it's actually diminishing nowadays at a greatly accelerated pace. i think that's a terrible thing. people who played eve and made it what it was wanted that cold dark universe. it's what truly set eve apart. the farther we drift from that the more danger we run of losing the title of \"something special\" and becoming just another sub-par mmo."

"fellow players,i would like to announce my intention to run for the 2nd csm. i offer myself as a principled candidate  with my core principles including:*an evidence-based approach: hard facts > hard opinion*open-minded and ready to listen to feedback or advice: nobody is infallible (including myself!)*proportional attention to different aspects of eve online: keep the bigger picture in mind *aim to keep eve fun: make things simpler if there is no reason for it to be difficulta short bit about the campaign and myself:i am one who, like many others, has stuck with eve through thick or thin, for the love of challenge and variety. over the years my in-game experience has accrued firsthand in fields that include several scales of pvp (and the odd yarr ^^), factional warfare, roleplaying, industry, trade and corporate leadership.the bottom line: were on one server  to further improve this unique game that we share, theres no point in making ambitious plans without thinking of the crucial interactions between the numerous professions and playstyles that co-exist. eve online is a uniquely constructed game where details and consequences *do* matter, and i care to think about them. some may ask, well scagga, thats all nice, but what policies/focus do you define your campaign by?while i do have many ideas as to how eve can be improved (several of which will be linked later on), i feel that it is best to appreciate the general direction the game ought to go, rather than remain transfixed to a small number of specific issues. im not running for csm to force half-baked ideas onto the community  im running for csm to see good, supported ideas in various fields receive fair attention. with eve being such a huge game that is played in such various ways, to tie ones self down to a mere handful of issues would not do it justice.my blog, which is currently being set up, can be found here: www.scagga.blogspot.com (well, not yet..)ideas consistent with my principles will also be included in subsequent posts.1. on 0.0., alliances and corporations2. on roleplaying and factional warfare3. pvp3.1 piracy3.2 guerrilla warfare and small scale pvp3.3 fleet engagements4. on the economy and its markets5. on agents, missions and introducing anti-metagaming mechanisms6. on the csmextras"
"a non-exhaustive chunk of views/ideasyes, this section will probably develop into a lot of text! i have emboldened executive summary statements for easier skim reading.1. on 0.0., alliances and corporationsa particular statement made by a ccp employee, that the eve world could be likened to an emerging nation, left a lasting impression on me. over the years, i have watched as huge amounts of work and organisation are poured into maintaining 0.0. alliances. they come and go, some leaving legacies that may be talked about till the servers go down. at present, we know of examples of territory holding alliances that may have developed increasingly complex relationships with those who reside in their space. however, i do believe that the current mechanics let down many of the people dedicated to building their own civilisation in 0.0.vision: enable mechanics for alliances to become more like empires, corporations more like business entitiesi support the idea of alliances being given the tools to be able to become more like empires in their own right. for instance, allowing an alliance to issue its own currency! more information about this idea will soon be available on my blog  the relevant link will be the devolution of isk if you are interested to read more!should alliances be able to issue their own currency?also, i support the evolution of mechanics to help alliances and corporations resemble more a business entity than an arbitrary group of people; one that can engage in formal agreements, rather than being bound by word of mouth. one idea in this likeness is the evolution of treaties, such as trade treaties. i believe such improvements can simplify adjusting relations between large entities, streamlining diplomacy and reducing existing obstructions towards creating rewarding mutual business relations. it could also allow a corporation to build an objectively based good reputation based on successful contract work. i will soon provide a link to the evolution of treaties idea on my blog for more information.the evolution of treaties between corporations and alliances is a worthwhile pursuitoutposts re-revisited - a growing number of them continue to mushroom up in 0.0., helping the taming of the once wild expanses. many may remember the passionately held ideas of the last csm chair, jade constantine. while i believe the idea was not perfect in its original form, i do agree that the current outpost system needs to be looked at.pillaging stations, rather than destroying themfirst let me say: i do not agree with the notion that it should be possible to completely destroy an outpost. however i feel that it is in variance with common sense that one cannot thoroughly 'pillage' a captured outpost and leave it derelict for someone else to repair up to operable status. on one hand i believe that for many, it is a landmark achievement to build these outposts and that this should be respected - furthermore that the assets contained should not be made vulnerable to destruction in the same way assets in a pos are vulnerable. on the other hand, i do believe that a conqueror should not be burdened with a logistics task nor be obliged to delegate it - one ought to be able to remove the useful station functions (including docking) and salvage minerals or components, that must later be replaced in order to reinstate functionality."
"2. on roleplaying and factional warfareyes, ingame i do roleplay an evil ammatar with a penchant for sneaky behaviour . in my view, whether you identify as a roleplayer is not important, what is important is that players can enjoy themselves if they choose to immerse themselves in the eve world.its about giving people options and supporting themwhile i see supporting enhancements to roleplaying as being under the umbrella of the csm, in principle, the changes i would support most are those that have a noticeable effect and can provide viable options  for example, the concept of hidden pirate agents (or even stations) in low security space. in summary, ideas that can give something to a wider variety of players.i would pay attention to working on issues with factional warfare - i have seen the problems firsthandfactional warfare is a concept that was long awaited, but currently has much space for improvement. i believe my firsthand experience of factional warfare has helped me understand the problems it is facing, having served amongst the commanders of the amarr militia for several months. i would support ideas that would help make factional warfare:- matter- be more fun / less grind-like- more worthwhile through incentives- find a workable solution to the exclusion of alliancesother thoughts that have crossed my mind for spicing up factional warfare include militia agents giving assassination jobs against highly productive enemy militiaman, loyalty point rewards for completing complexes, expanded/discounted loyalty point stores for higher ranks, system capture awards, alliance 'leanings' etc that said, there is much discussion required on all these topics.3. pvp3.1 piracyive had experience as a pirate in the past, and over the years i feel i am not alone in noticing it become progressively harder to enjoy, for reasons that may vary from simple mechanics (e.g. warp to zero) to the prey becoming more sparse and risk averse (e.g. blobs, high sec level 4 agents..etc). other than factional warfare, i see very few viable attractions that would lure a significant number of pilots into low sec, the pirate's playing field.i remember the days when pirate corps seemed more numerous and feared, when pirates were a significant concern. i must clarify: i do not support making it easier per se, rather more supportive of new strategies and integrated with ingame mechanics.piracy is a profession that could be more interesting and less lineari would support improvements that would make the profession more varied in activities, with game mechanics that can support them. for pirates, this may include proposing hidden pirate agents in low security space, as well as increasing the allure of low security space to attract an increased number of potential targets. i would also like to open discussion for probing other potential improvements that can be made in this area."
"3.2 guerrilla warfare and small scale pvphaving observed conflicts over time, i believe that more should be done to support genuine guerrilla warfare. time and time again, i have observed as players complain that attempts to raid or engage in 'small scale pvp' are not sufficiently supported (e.g. being frequently blobbed to the stone age). naturally it is not anything as simple as this, and i could open an entirely new can of worms (a most pungeant one actually) about nanos, but this is not my focus. my focus is consistent with my view that alliances should become more like empires, and thus it should be possible to infiltrate these empires, in an almost partisanesque form.mechanics for the longer term infiltration of enemy space need to be supported if guerrilla warfare and fighting behind enemy lines is to be a viable realitythis concept could help spread battles over larger areas, promote small groups to hunt each other down, as this would be more efficient in eliminating an 'infestation' than the more orthodox \"reds? in my 0.0.? blob them!\" approach. i feel this would add a new dimension to empire wars and mean that control over one's territory is not assured by mere sovereignty.0.0. warfare needs battles spread over larger areas in order to promote small group tacticsok, that may sound appealing to some. well, what do i think it could mean? i have thoughts along the lines of small, deployable bases e.g. such as independent modules such as defenceless hidden mobile factories/storage facilities, or along the lines of a new role for a ship e.g. a new role for certain (capital/t3?) ships to have a 'deploy' mode, like the mobile construction vehicle from c&c . i am interested in opening discussion on such ideas."
"3.3 fleet engagementsthey are getting to be huge, involving multiple alliances at times. it is not consistent with my views that eve should encourage bigger and bigger same-grid engagments. rather i envision fleet engagements to grow in area covered, with remote coordination of smaller groups between group commanders increasing.a fleet's chain of command should extend beyond the actual members in the chat channel - i envision a \"commander in chief\" being given ingame tools to remotely direct the objectives of numerous independent fleets, squads or individuals. improving the tools for remotely coordinating can help spread forces across more objectivesof the more ambitious ideas i have regarding fleet warfare include the creation of (a) 'central command' and (b) visual battleplans:it would thus be possible to use an ingame interface to draw lines on the eve map, signifying the last known positions and movements of different wings or squads of a fleet in a complex maneuever. it can also be used to give different squads their own objectives - e.g. click on icon representing squad 8, type command and it is sent to the commander of that squad. reporting can be done in the same way.this idea can be extended to encompass multiple fleets across several regions! this would allow the coordination of massive numbers of pilots in many different locations at the same time. the commanders would be able report their position and conditions back to the cnc, and thus allow a command structure to become much more interesting.examples of minor improvements to fleet warfare that i would be open to discuss:- enable motds for standing orders, which helps reduce the need to repeat orders if you are reconnecting / joining late- allow fleet/wing/squad commanders to have a differently coloured text- create a 'merge fleet' option to automate the unifying of different gangs- supporting the 'automatic continuation of fire after reloading'- allow the fc to know the shiptypes of his gangmembers automatically from his watchlist, or another ui option, allowing him to assess the situation more accurately- allow the fc to label aforementioned list with 'roles' if necessary"
"4. on the economy and its marketsover the course of time i have spent playing eve i have always tried to get the most out of it, but exploring the different professions - the one i am currently spending most of my time doing is trading. while i enjoy the competitive atmosphere and 'location location location' of trading, i do find that there is a lack of 'control' over who you choose to do business with, as well as a penury of information that 'could' be available to them. some minor market improvements i would propose opening for discussion:i. support trade embargoes! why allow your market orders to sell to or buy from enemies? one should be able to starve them out of areas of empire where your traders/friendly traders may hold dominance. i would place such measures under the 'evolution of treaties' ideas that was mentioned earlier. the idea entails a small fee (similar to a wardec fee) to keep it running, as well as increased broker fees throughout its tenure.ii. give traders more information! quantity, and quality:a. market search options:- seller names: i would suggest that agents be used to ask on your behalf, for a small fee per trade order you ask aboutb. the market graphs:- compare price changes between products: i.e. be able to add more lines to the time/price graphs- distinguish between 'buy orders filled' and 'sell orders bought from' when looking at a product's volume of movement on the market tab (change it to a stacked column)c. map options:- be able to assess the value of transactions over time in each system by adding another map option- be able to assess the quantity of stock available on the market in each system by adding another map optiond. support for ipos and investment deals- creating mechanics to support ingame investments, aiding keeping track of investors and interest payments rather than relying on 3rd party software or webpagese. npc shares (a little more extreme)- allow players the ability to buy shares in npc corporations, which can be affected by ingame events, but also vice versa: also affect ingame events!"

"if you had to choose between scamming a member of your ingame corporation, gaining their trust and taking them for pretty much everything they're worth, or preforming a corptheft while having access to take everything in the hangers and the entire corpwallet; which would you choose, why?please explain in detail."
"well. there's pro's and con's to both:the first scenario you build up trust to a single individual and then break it. i don't like breaking the trust that i build up with somebody for momentary gain.but in the second case you affect a whole corporation and possibly the work that the members have put into it. you don't as much build up trust with just 1 person but rather the general perception people in the corporation has of you.it's a matter if i would rather want to have to shoot a family member of mine or drop a nuclear bomb on their house. you only affect a single individual directly, however you kill them instantly. but the nuclear bomb(while it might kill them eventually), they could survive and rebuild themselves eventually.i seriously don't like making people sad. so i'm going with neither. which is the lesser evil? the one you break the spirit of a potentially weak individual, the other you don't as much. the corp theft option could give you fame and lulz if you are into that kind of thing however.i will say the first option, because it's probably a bit harder depending on the person."

"what has been your primary interest in eve in the last 6 months? basically, why do you log on?"
"tip of the day #5back when i was a new guy, i joined up with a pirate corporation and did piracy. i flew the blackbird in the area around jan in lonetrek. it was lots of fun.since then i have had vacations from the pirate life where i have taken part in wars like iss vs. iac, lv vs ra and other fun wars. eventually the outlaw life always pulls me back.the life of a pirate is fun. small-scale warfare is still very much possible. however, i think it wouldn't hurt to give much more incentive for people to have people move into low-sec. there's a reason why very few people mine in low-sec, it's simply not worth the risk()"
"as i just described in my tip of the day, my piracy background is keeping me interested in eve. i tried 0.0, but the lag and blobs are no fun. while lots of good fights are to be had in 0.0, i just find low-sec to be much better.however, lately i have been getting into exploration based on discussion we have had on the csm about exploration. it has certainly kept me playing much more than i used to do over the summer.during the summer eve was kinda a chat-room for me. the community has always been important for me. so my average week is like:monday-thursday: some roaming in low-sec and some exploration in 0.0friday-sunday: lots of pvp with my extended family(corporation)."
"can you enlighten us a little on what type of ships and ammunition you use when pirating? how would you rate your understanding of ship-fittings and different setups that can be used by eve players?take care,arithron"

"i don't actually see a lot of difference between your two options - in both cases you're abusing the trust of ig friends to steal their stuff, the only difference is whose stuff you're stealing. that said, in my personal case, i am in a corp composed almost entirely of a group of rl friends, all of whom are well enough off that we don't really have corp assets. if i took the corp wallet, they'd crack a joke about me being desperate enough to need a million and a half, and then steal a quarter from me irl and call it even. i could get way more from scamming their personal wallets, but i wouldn't do that to them.if i was in a more conventional corp, with larger numbers of people who i didn't all know, and actual corp assets, it starts to depend on circumstances. if there's an utter jerk in the corp who has annoyed me, i'll probably clean him out personally. failing that, i'd probably take the lazy way out, scam whoever has the worst security provisions, and call it a public security announcement on the value of making sure you hold onto your assets. if there's one pile of assets far bigger than the others though, i'll probably go for that - if i'm severing ties anyways, i might as well get as much as i can. given that there's no real moral distinction between individual fraud and collective fraud, i'll go for whichever seems more practical."
"you had me at ui. you had me at ui - even before talking about my useless charisma points. how does ccp think they can do wod if they can't come up with useful charisma-based skills?"
"what has been your primary interest in eve in the last 6 months? basically, why do you log on?"
"thanks for the support. i suppose if i had to phrase it briefly, the best answer is \"building for the future\". for a variety of reasons, i haven't had the time to sit down and do what i really want to - make my corp into something bigger than just a group of friends, or move my corpies and i into something that already is - so i've focused on building my ability to do the same in the future. part of that is skilling, of course, part is building methods of providing income and useful assets in future(datacores, researched blueprints, etc.), part is building a reputation through forums and my lottery, part is learning about the parts of the game i don't already know, and part is making money. it sounds a bit weak, and i suppose in some ways it is, but it's what i've been doing."
"herschel, i appreciate the offer to help but my question remains unanswered.tusko would you mind chiming in on this? i'm specifically interested in why those two issues which look like imbalance issues are on your list of important first-cycle \"fairness issues\" but you suggest that other imbalance issues are not on your first cycle. are they on the queue for the second cycle? third? is imbalance something the csm should be involved with at all? you introduced a distinction and i don't understand where you chose to draw the line and would like to understand your thinking.contrasting your comments with this:and i hope you understand that it is important to me that i can trust your judgment on these issues."
"sembur, i understand your desire for an exact explanation on how i decide whether something is balanced or not, but i can't give you an universal formula. having played a game a lot you get a feeling on what is overpowered and what is unused... and ships and modules being unused or overused is a clear sign that there is something wrong with the balance. i would also like to point out that i have only been an alternate during the first cycle. i was not in position to put items on the agenda, so i was not the one who decided that these issues will get voted upon while others do not. all i got back than was the chance to vote whether i see these problems relevant enough to be forwarded to ccp or not. tbh balancing industrial ships is nowhere in my list of priorities. as for your question whether csm is is supposed to be involved with balance issues? hell yeah, for sure! csm represent players. and as the assembly hall shows, players are highly sensitive to balance problems in game, it is the most common type of issue they keep reporting. it would be plain wrong to decide not to represent them. of course every csm has a preference on the type of the issues he/she considers to be important, and csms also usually have slightly different opinion on balance issues. i have been playing this game for 5 years now, i am familiar with the small-scale 0.0 pvp part of the game and also with the big, laggy, hundreds versus hundreds fleet battles we are doing on max, and i think i am pretty good at figuring out what's broken balancewise in these areas. on other topics, like the crane one, which does not have so much to do with pvp, all i can do is talk to my supporters (got the entire hungarian community behind me, from carebears to outlaws), ask them for their opinion, read the forums, do the math or whatever to figure out if a request has merit or not. your question regarding my decision to vote yes on these issues can be answered pretty easily, as these are a few of the issues that can be proved by numbers. the crane is a blockade runner. it is supposed to be faster than the other ships because it is a \"runner\". that is its main role, as it is too small to be a regular hauler. i do not know who's spoiled idea was it to give it so little powergrid that even at level 5 skills it is unable to fit a microwarpdrive, unlike all the other blockade runners which can do this. to be able to mwd or not to be able to mwd is a key factor in case of blockade runners. but in case of the crane i had another reason to vote a yes for it. i think blockade runners in general do not fulfill their role properly, as they cannot actually survive blockades, not even simple ones. today's 0.0 logistics are done using jump capable ships, as the jump drive is an extremely safe method to haul stuff. i am not very happy with it, and i think boosting regular haulers *in general* could counteract the capital usage at least a little bit."
"the nighthawk is a completely different question. i could fly one but i don't. fitting it in eft shows already sufficient problems, but that is not the reason that made me see that there is a problem with the nighthawk... the real figure that shows that something is wrong is the proportion of the nighthawk/drake proportion in pvp situations. i did a quick query for you on our killboard with the ship usage stats on these ships: nighthawk: 1023 drake+ferox: 9936+2287 ratio:7.7%astarte: 1819 myrmidon+brutix: 2719+2762 ratio: 24.9%sleipnir: 2626 hurricane+cyclone: 8088+968 ratio: 22.5%absolution: 1470 harbinger+prophecy: 2139+802 ratio: 33.3%this is a multi-corp-multi-alliance killboard, sample size was 67.000 kills with 442.000 participations total. this figure suggests that there is something really wrong with the nighthawk. it not only fails in pve (compared to the popularity in drake), it is not being used for pvp either. so it's underused (compared to the other races), which indicates that there are problems with it. passing a nighthawk related issue to ccp serves 2 reasons: first, it tells them about the powergrid shortage of the nighthawk. second, and more important, it tells them that they should take a look at the nighthawk because the people are unhappy with it. i personally would leave most of the balancing to ccp, they are better at it than a a few hundreds of players, as they are not driven by the desire to get their own stuff buffed. however to help the nighthawk getting balanced, its easiest to let issues like this pass. i hope these answers satisfied your curiosity a little bit. i can understand if you wanna see some kind of proof that my sense of balance is right, but you have to trust me on this one. optionally, you can go ask people who know me from longer ago, as someone stating that he is okay is not very convincing."
"capitalism actually does the opposite of entrenching people. pure capitalism is an extremely volatile environment (like anarchy). it is easy to amass assets, but very easy to lose them as well. just like an anarchy, successful entities will seek to hold onto their gains by creating barriers to entry. the key is unbiased regulation. regulate too much and you entrench, regulate too little and the successful will try to control the market to entrench themselves.with that said, which path do you feel ccp needs to go down at this point? regulate to break-up the entrenched or deregulate to remove the protections of the entrenched?"

"if you had to choose between scamming a member of your ingame corporation, gaining their trust and taking them for pretty much everything they're worth, or preforming a corptheft while having access to take everything in the hangers and the entire corpwallet; which would you choose, why?please explain in detail."
"they both require the need to instil trust and confidence in a person, or a collective, and you could argue that one is worse because of the face to face defrauding and subsequent destruction of your own credibility, however, in terms of cold, hard, raw tactics and strategy, i believe the implanting of spies and the ability to compromise and even destroy from within should never be taken off the table as an option when faced with a goal or an objective in which such actions deem it necessary. the scamming of someone on your team rarely, if ever ultimately leads to accomplishing such goals."

"local chat being moved into a \"delayed\" mode could be workable. however it must update for everyone at the same time. if you jump into a system, then either local updates for everyone or it doesn't update for you until everyone gets the update. while i appreciate teh desire to gank the **** outta farmer raven's you do need to have a tool to defend yourself, if say. the local scanner updated every thirty second like a radar pulse (for everyone at the same time) then there would be enough opportunity for good scanners to catch people, and yet no so much that they cannot catch anything as is now. thirty seconds may be on the high side tbh. in \" bigger\" situations it would certainly have vary'ing effects. watching local rise as a hostile gang jumps in can give a good measure of their size, while if you have to wait for local it gives pre-set coverts a large advantage. in \" huge \" situations it would have almost no effect from what i can see."
"yes something should be done. however you can't take away what has already been made, nor increase the costs for new ones. i dont know what the exact solution is but it lies most likely within the power of the doomsday. as a brdige tool titans are fine.as a gang bonus tool titans are fine.as a massive corp/ship hangar titans are fine.as a massive smartbomb titans have an issue. eve is certainly becoming more player friendly. tbh its hardly hello kitty online. new players get a few more skillpoints and some better tutorials. i dont see anything wrong with that. that about all new players get versus what we used to get. if there is something else i'm missing let me knowas to ccp caving under whining, thats an issue with ccp's ability to understand how game mechanic's work and not to knee-jerk to hard in any one direction."

"as a primarily industrial player i feel that the mining rewards are much lower in 0.0 if you are doing it for anything more than isk. while a decent sized mining operation can clean out the a/b/c minerals pretty quickly, compress them, jump em up to empire and be $2 billion richer for a rorqual cargo hold full if you actually say want the minerals that come out of those to make something it's downright impossible.i don't know a good way to do it off the top of my head, but i feel that there needs to be some way to either have rocks that provide more stuff, or ships that eat those rocks faster. i've always liked the idea of a planet-killer (from star trek) looking ship that just rules up to one end of the belt and proceeds to eat it.i've only lived outside of 0.0 short of a very small amount of time at the very beginning of playing the game. the last time i tried to mission was 2005, so maybe things have changed. but to me, they were pretty boring. for me the excitement of 0.0 is what people make of it. i do think there should be the ability to put agents or other empire-like components into the station. we shouldn't have to go to empire to get npc only things like pos fuel components.i don't think there should be any major changes to 0.0 as a reward for 'making it' because you really haven't 'made it'. there are areas of 0.0 space where chinese ratters can play all day and no one knows they are there. there are areas of 0.4 space that if you step foot in you'll be wiped in an instant. that's to me what i like about the game. if you try and turn 0.0 into the wow raid gold rush it would destroy the game.i don't think 0.0 needs any status to enrich the game. i think there are mechanics of sovereignty and fleet combat that would make it fun. from what i can see the population of 0.0 isn't upset that there aren't uber missions with billions in rewards, or some ultra rare officer drops, it's because when they actually try and do these epic battles they showed in the empyrian age ads you get a lag fast and people loose expensive assets.change is good, as long as the change doesn't benefit the exploit driven isk farmers.i wrote up some ideas a while back with regards to this. it's a delicate balance you have people with 5 years invested in this game and you don't want to take away all their toys but at the same time the toys create the instabilitiy. i think minor changes such as max number of remote reps per ship, blobs of capitals causing cyno lock on issues, multiple doomsdays actually backfiring onto the titan, things like that.for me, the ability for a community to develop their own region free from the bonds of anything is what makes 0.0 so much fun. i would like to see the ability to create the same level of protection for the sovereignty holders that empire and concord offer. you jump into a system, we don't like you, gate guns light you up. sure you can get away, but you can't sit around either or wander through the sov holders space without being challenged.get more people out in it."
"answering this chap's questions1. in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?i - i would like to see illegal boosters become more attractive options for pilots - make them more powerful in order to increase demand and thus increase the profitability of gas cloud harvesting. i've done it and find it's a pitifully unrewarding job compared to other forms of 0.0. mining/isk making.ii - i am also in support of reconsidering the loot tables for npcs in light of the negative effect that this has on the 0.0. mining profession.2. how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?(please see my answers to q 3-7)3. what improvements would you like to see in 0.0 as an endgame, things to reward players for having \"made it.\"i - reduce the unnecessary difficulty of certain 'chores' - allow 'fuel packages' to be manufactured from npc pos products.ii - i would support planetary interaction, but this is already coming soon (tm)4. how would you raise the status of 0.0 in a productive way to enrich the game?i would support the rise of treaties. i have stated in my campaign thread that i would like to make alliances more like empires. i will present this particular idea in a logical format:problem:- it is difficult to form formal business relationships with 0.0. nbsi alliances for various reasons- diplomacy for standings and docking rights etc is more work than it should besolution:- enhance contracts (add treaties), that can allow for appropriate standings and docking rights (etc) to be set only for the duration of the contract's activitythis can:- allow contracts to outsource logistics work i.e. set a level you would like to maintain stockpiles at, and the contract renews every week with whatever amount is required to meet that quantity- formalise mercenary contracts or military interventions on behalf of another entity- streamline diplomacy: i.e. have some premade treaties available to diplomats to sign (with presets analogous to the roles attached to a rank in a corp)- formalise 'pet' statuse.g. officialdom for pets, official logistics contracts (recurring whenever stockpiles are low)"
"5. are you in favor of any role separation or gap-filling with regard to the infrastructure of 0.0? (in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roles)absolutely. as i will mention in the next question, i am in support of structures that are intermediates between the pos and the giant secure container - i.e. one can set up disparate undefended modules in 0.0 space, which can be hidden and act as a secret base in enemy held space. if the enemy lacks the ability to effectively patrol their own territory, why can't it be infiltrated by 'soft' forces?6. changes to any capitals or sub-caps in context of healthier 0.0?rather than change the actual ships, i think that the battlefield should be the focus for improvement. i think that 0.0. warfare suffers from excessive concentration of objectives, that force standing armies to mass in a small number of locations. this makes for generally less enjoyable experiences when one considers the inability of the server to cope on numerous occasions. one of the summary points from my campaign thread was:0.0. warfare needs battles spread over larger areas in order to promote small group tacticsi agree with the idea that the battleship should be considered the 'main' ship of a fleet. as such i would support proposals to encourage objectives to be spread out, to allow for smaller ships in smaller groups to clash, with the massive, laggy fleet engagements becoming rarer and less efficient.an example of a change based on these principles includes rogue mobile installations (e.g. mobile factories/mobile storage modules) that can be deployed deep into enemy space, so that guerrilla groups can operate out of them and cause mayhem in the hinterlands. i do not believe that a pos or an npc station should be the only conduit to setting up a base near the enemy core territories.7. any other comments in areas not covered by the questions?(see the last question, for alliance mechanics)* how would you make 0.0 cooler?i would allow the devolution of currency (isk) - allow alliances to mint their own currency, backed against isk (or even the universal average price of certain commodities, if i can get my head how that works).why?- it can allow an alliance to protect its internal economy from outside interference e.g.1: hostile forces buy out the markete.g.2: 'allies'/'pets' come to compete/undersell your alliance mates- it can allow the stations to only accept transactions in the alliance's currency, which will support internal industry and trading, giving it an edge over outsiders who mostly have isk rather than the alliance credits- it will allow an alliance to pay salaries that can only be spent within the alliance - this may bolster internal trade- it allows for very interesting new professions: making money from currency exchange? - could it allow alliance finance leaders to deliberately devalue their currency to counter corp wallet thefts?"
"1. in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?i'd like to see more rewards for individual players. i may be part of my alliance's executive team, but i don't reap any financial benefit from it; i make my own isk just like everyone else. i'd like for there to be more ways for the individual player to make money beyond ratting. i think the notion that ccp bandied about regarding \"individual player residences\" a while back has some potential to it, especially if coupled with a way to make use of some new form of resources to give even individual pilots some sort of revenue stream. i'd also like to see exploration sites become more lucrative; more about this in a bit. 2. how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?see above. 3. what improvements would you like to see in 0.0 as an endgame, things to reward players for having \"made it.\"from the perspective of someone who very definitely hasn't \"made it\", the ability to fly capital ships in big fleet battles and score major strategic victories seems like a pretty good endgame to me. as does the notion of having sovereignty over an area of space, knowing that you're leading an empire in your own right. that's pretty awesome. 4. how would you raise the status of 0.0 in a productive way to enrich the game?honestly? i think advertising its benefits could help quite a bit. when i was a very new player, i had no idea just how great the rewards could be in 0.0, even in terms of ratting. \"\"a new life awaits you in the off-world colonies...\" 5. are you in favor of any role separation or gap-filling with regard to the infrastructure of 0.0? (in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roles) 6. changes to any capitals or sub-caps in context of healthier 0.0?black ops. i really want to love them, and i can envision a few scenarios in which they could be used effectively in concert with recons and stealth bombers. however, none of these scenarios involve using its special capabilities. i'm looking forward to seeing how that changes with the potential addition of a fuel bay; i'd like to see greater range, and the ability to jump into cyno-jammed systems. they could have a serious impact on 0.0 warfare that way. they also need to be cheaper: they're designed to be risked, and unlike marauders there is no pve rationale for their existence. i cannot justify flying one into combat at their current price point given their capabilities. carriers. presently these are utterly vital to 0.0 logistics, and i'm reluctant to see them changed in any way. however! i could see my way towards rebalancing them more towards combat and decreasing their role in logistics, *if* a new jump-capable capital ship was introduced to fill the logistics gap. before you say \"jump freighter\", let me point out that i am thinking specifically of the ship-transport role here. it should have a larger sma, being dedicated to ferrying ships around, and have a jump range similar to current carriers. it should have a similar price point to a carrier, and be easy for someone who can already fly a carrier to skill for. and perhaps be a little bit easi*er* for someone who isn't currently a cap pilot to obtain. 7. any other comments in areas not covered by the questions?i think we could use some more 0.0 space in general. as a member of a small alliance, i feel pretty hemmed in by the big boys. we need breathing room. more space, particularly close to npc-sov 0.0 where the smaller alliances already tend to subsist (because sov is already claimed by by goons or bob or whomever) would go a long way to helping the little guys make their dreams of growing come true.(continued)"
"8. how would you make 0.0 cooler?a few things i'd like to see:* 0.0 events. not many of the in-game events have reached out into 0.0 space; it'd be neat to see some plot points happening out there that players can take part in.* alliance - empire relationships. building on the above, it'd be really cool to see the impacts of 0.0 warfare on the empires, and vice versa. right now it's like the caldari, gallente, amarr and minmatar live in this vacuum which has no connection to the warp and weft of 0.0 politics at all. that seems unrealistic. it's not realistic to think that the caldari state would not take notice of the conflict between bob and the north when some of the major battlegrounds are less than a dozen jumps from jita, for example. how does the state react?* enhanced exploration content. 0.0 is supposed to be poorly explored and poorly understood. i think the idea of exploration is really cool, but \"exploring\" in a system that you already know like the back of your hand and finding some randomly spawned site seems a little, i don't know, ho-hum. i think it would be really cool if there was a sprinkling of unknown territories to explore - hidden systems, secret stargates, and the like. i'd also see exploration content that was a little 'spookier' and enhanced that sensation of dealing with the unknown. mysteriously abandoned, damaged ships drifting through space like the flying dutchman. lost colonies. evidence of the movement of powers we know not wot of. that sort of thing. exploration was one of the things that first drew me to eve in the hope that it would bring a certain amount of wonder and mystery. right now i think it's a little boring; i'd like to see it come to life."
"none of both, there is always a different way. if i am required to do one of both actions to proceed i wouldn't do any of those. a goal, that requires you to perform one of these actions isn't worth achieving."

"thank god, finally some action.this one failed to meet quorum, and as such it ought properly to be deferred, not passed.shame on both of them. also, unless there's a good explanation, i'm disappointed by ank and inanna for causing the deferment above, and to some extent jade and lavista for missing other votes. of the ten of you, only four (tusko, deirdra, bane, and arithron) managed to hit 16 threads in a week. worse yet, of the 5 csm #2 candidates with voting rights, only 2 voted on all topics, and 1 missed entirely. pathetic."
"oi! that's pretty harsh since you didn't actually see the actual vote i did.the issue in question(number 2) was already addressed by ccp. it's beyond me why it was voted upon. had it *not* been resolved by now, i would have voted. i even posted in the damn thread hardin created when he raised the issue.it's very dangerous to jump to conclusions like that. don't do it."
"i saw variable numbers of votes cast, and i wondered who missed votes. i did a quick scan of the list, and i didn't look at who missed which votes. sorry about misrepresenting you, that's a perfectly valid reason."
"not a problem. i just wanted to make sure there wasn't any misunderstanding. no offense taken or anything"
"now, care to explain the other five of them?"
"herschel, i actually showed up for this meeting when it was called last week. it was decided by jade then, that the meeting would be conducted over forums and email. a number of questions were asked and ignored. some people simply mailed in votes, which i think runs counter to the entire process. as a matter of fact, i don't believe it's the process at all. so you'll have to forgive me if i didn't meet an arbitrary deadline to cast a fake \"yes\" or \"no\" vote on topics with little to no discussion. when we have a meeting i'll be there or provide an excuse. when we have a mess of one-way communications you'll forgive me if i don't see the logic in the process.i'll also note that the number of posts you make on the eve-online.com forums is an artificial measure of a csm's worth and a farcical one at that."
"i raised the requisite number of 'aye' votes required when i submitted my votes. personally, i still think 7 csm members (inc alts) are required before a vote can be seen as binding.where i voted no, it was often because the details given on the thread were sparse, or required more explanation. as i have no access to the csm forum, and no further details were mailed, i believe not voting for escalation was the correct way to go. on a couple issues, i voted no due to ccp addressing them recently, or in process of (eg, alliance logos).i find the whole system of voting without discussion and the ability to question in a meeting format unsatisfactory. i don't like the system, and won't be looking to keep using it next csm round.take care,arithron"
"i see that you showed up, which is of course better than those who didn't. but at the end of the day, you're elected to the csm so that you can help make decisions on these issues, not so that you can sit out in silent protest. whatever the failings of the process - and i agree, there may well be many when it's based on votes cast on non-public forums with no preparation and (from the sounds of it) sparse participation - you were elected to vote, not to ignore the process. the deadline was no more arbitrary than any other, and the vote was no more fake than any other. your votes were, however, far more absent in this meeting than in any other. as for the number of posts you make on the forums determining your worth, i never claimed that it did - i post because i like to, not because i think it makes me a better person or a better player. i'm in full agreement with your rationale from a different thread that you don't need to be on the forums to be a good and active csm rep. but at the same time, i will say that you need to do your duty as a csm rep to be considered a good csm rep. you have in past, but you didn't here. there are better ways to show dissatisfaction than sitting on your hands."
"it was a suboptimal resolution of a process that was forced on us by failing to reach quorum for 2 straight weeks followed by the weeks of csm/ccp talks. i proposed this as a method of resolving the stalled meeting and clearing the backlog of issues and all csm delegates present accepted the proposal.its certainly not a style of resolution i would advocate should be followed by the 2nd csm and i hope for your sakes you won't get into the position where you find it impossible to get a combination of 7 delegates from the permanent members and alternates for 4 weeks in a row. messy, somewhat unsatisfying and crude. but ultimately it got the job done and from my own perspective i did get decent discussion on my smart bomb issue and reached a negotiated settlement capable of getting that proposal through the council. other candidates managed discussion on their issues also - ultimately its neccessary for people to initiate talks if they want them outside of the live chat environment. in terms of quorum for this vote i assumed that everyone who cast at least one vote was \"present\" for this virtual meeting. that means that ank, jade, tusko, lavista, dierdra, bane and inanna were \"present\" from the permanent members of the council. and since that left 2 empty slots arithron's alternate votes counted too. where \"present\" delegates are not recorded next to a vote that means they abstained or choose not to cast a vote either way for whatever reason. anyway, whats done is done and at least we've cleared the backlog. hopefully we'll get people to turn up for next sunday's live meeting."
"there was no \"silent protest\", merely the living of a busy life that doesn't lend itself well to hitting f5 all day in a forum on the off chance that someone has answered a question. my point was not meant to be that i've protested the vote as i would not have changed the outcome. my point was that this was not a meeting, nor how meetings should be conducted, as there was little to no feedback given and little to no discussion whatsoever.to be frank in order to ignore the process the process must be followed. in this case it didn't and there's lessons to be learned from it. the deadline was arbitrary in the sense that there was no meeting, the meeting that did happen i made time in my schedule to have. the vote under question in that there was no discussion and people purposefully ignored requests for feedback.my responsibility as a csm is not merely to show up and vote. to be fair had i not been so busy i'd have done what serenity did and simply vote no across the board if there was not going to be any discussion had.:edit: the post sounds far more scathing than it should and i am indeed contrite that i did not merely do the formality of emailing a bunch of yesses and no's, but i have a bit more respect for the system as it's meant to be than that and am more disappointed with the process than anything or anyone in particular."
"what is the basis for the comment that ccp has solved this alreay. this has been broken for far too long and i have yet to see any feedback from ccp about an eta. you escalate planetary colonies and blow this off? seems broken to me.issler"
"this devblogbasically shows ccp know there was a problem and are taking steps to solve it. ultimately not much else we can do there except say \"thanks.\""
"i may be wrong, but i don't think you've used that method of quorum before. it's always been the assumption that if there aren't 7 votes, there aren't 7 voters, and thus there's no quorum. it's a bit different when the votes are simultaneous versus sequential, but it seems like a pretty odd ruling nonetheless. if that's how you're doing it though, i suppose i can't really object. then hit it once a day. that's still 7 rounds of discussion(assuming there's discussion to be had) and that's still a good way of ensuring that you don't miss anything. i never claimed it was how meetings should be conducted - it seems pretty clear that it wasn't. i'm not convinced that forums can't work, but i will certainly agree that someone will need to think through how it's done next time instead of just doing it in a rush. but it was the meeting. and this isn't a shot at you, but if every member i've heard complain about lack of discussion had actually discussed, there wouldn't have been a problem. purposefully ignored? that's a bold statement. and was there no discussion on any of the topics? also, the conventional vote on an unsupported suggestion is \"nay\", not ignoring its existence. serenity voted no across the board? why weren't they recorded? and while voting certainly isn't your whole responsibility, it is part of it. fair enough, i can't really dispute your rationale. the meeting sounds like it was terrible in just about all regards. just saying, is all."
"well usually its a matter of beginning the meeting and asking the people in the chat channel to say \"hi i'm here\" and if the total = 7 then we're quorum. the mail-in votes off-line forum hybrid thing we had to do last week was a different kettle of fish born in necessity. the ultimate cause of the problem was simply getting (or not getting) 7 people in a forum channel at the publicised meeting time for too many weeks in a row.we have however had situations in the live chat when delegates have refused to vote yes or no and registered an abstain - and that hasn't automatically triggered the end of the meeting due going under the required total of yes or no votes. ah well, like i said - it was suboptimal but entirely neccessary and absolutely none of csm delegates raised a complaint at the time i proposed this method of resolution in the circumstances."
"i look forward to your finished product"
"interesting, i'd like to see those numbers or some evidence of that. one for one huh? or are you just talking out the side of your neck?for people that are in .5 in higher i think an option to opt out of pvp much like the factional warfare could work. not that i think it'll happen, but it could work."
"you mean like staying in 0.5 sec and above?"
"you can't! you are eula violator! you insulted ccp t0rfifrans by suggesting he should be dismissed from his position, and even more so, you suggested ccp will cover things up by sending poor t0rfi to rehab! so enjoy your 14 day ban, and be a good little subscription payer next time, and accept what your ccp masters tell you. /sarcasm off. you got for it jinx if they let you now with the forum ban on your record. i fully support pos overhaul by the way."
"this,fuel barscentral \"docking\" with acess to all silo and fuel, and not having to offload silo to change content."

"i agree with the op, i think some sort of review of minnie caps would be good.the one thing he didn't mention was some kind of typhoon-esque split weaponry bonus which would be a marginal bonus at least. i'm sure that's come up in the discussion somewhere there."
"ok so if this was such a grat idea why was it ignored??? i would like to see the creation of alliance hangers!!!"
"even with logs people can take stuff,and as gyro said there really wont be a way to limit access to it memebr to member and who would want to in alliances with 300+ people would be a pain. i do however support the idea in that an alliance hanger of some sort would be good for putting ammo, cap boosters and stuff that isn't worth much but very helpful to alliance members."

"ccp needs to understand that rp/immersion of eve and especially live events will be the main factors that will ensure game's future. not balancing, not graphics updates, not lag, not ambulation. immersion and live events are #1 issue, to which ccp managers should dedicate talented, thoughtful people."
"/signed. this is by far the most important reason for me deciding to join ushra'khan and rp. seeing the news stories on these events and peoples participation in them lead me to extend my 14 day trial. these events kept me in game during all the tough times. they are by far, the most entertaining and sorely missed aspect of this game."
"many times /signed"
"/signedambulation is finally on the cards but fw activity is steadily decreasing because of the lack of any real advantages to taking systems.the rp side of the game really needs some direct ccp involvement to show the community they still care about it. otherwise, (seriously) what is the point of all these chronicles and short stories?"

"i support this and so does my alt!please, please, please bring back aurora events or something similar thereto.they were something amazing and unique to eve. they made the setting come alive. they gave the loyalists input from their factions, something new to spin their imaginations around, and they were open ended - they could go any way, based on what the players did.in particular, the wolves of pator arc was exquisite. the \"npcs\" had vivid personalities and they acted according to them. they were dynamic, responding to interactions that crossed boundaries between storylines. they were...argh, god, it was so damn good.as a lifelong roleplayer, i've seen stories where the writers thought that \"affecting the story\" was simply the potential for players to turn up at a fight as determined by the storytellers, and win or lose.but in a truly immersive environment, you have npcs with goals, interacting with pcs and trying to achieve those goals, rather than a storyline with highlighted areas where pcs can push or pull. the perfect npc cannot be distinguished from a pc in any way.that's when you have a living story - more than that, not just one story, but many of them, all interacting with each other and having effects on each other, and you can drown happily in the complexity.please, please, please can we have our wonderful greenies back? we loved them very much."
"i support this.i have never experienced a live event (my character is only 6 months old), but i find the \"news\" are a little ... artificial. it lacks the in-game events to make the \"world news\" more palpable, more in-line with the players.when the titan in luminaire came (the first day of empyrean age), i made a long trip only to see it in my t1 frigate, only to be a tiny element of this universe, to maybe be a part of the history.... but there was nothing more (to my knowledge), nothing to do, and the titan is still here, doing nothing ... :(please, bring back live events !"
"this... would have been amazing. i support this. *smile*"
"yes, yes, yes!i don't really care if aurora had a bad rep. the one moment i'll always remember from eve was when u'k was holding the muritor vigil and i suddenly take notice of three fleet tempests appearing, with a sleipnir arriving a bit later. that scene was memorable.bring back in-game live events!"
"i have been lucky to be involved in many stories. from an escaped slave requesting escort from 9uy to rens, chased by slavers, to flying with the defiants against the amarrian battle-stations.i still live in hope but fear that \"all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...\""
"i have never been in a live event but that would be great.it dont have to be epic scale battles to crash servers, answering a distress call of a trade convoy can make all setting of eve real and live.pleeeease :)"
"yes!"
"this. this. this."
"in the name of the t2 cows, and the steak sauce,/signed"
"supported. i didn't have the opportunity to get involved in... well... any events, but they were tasty little vignettes that i would have liked to be part of. the closest i got was offering some bms (this was before wtz) to a freighter pilot (he declined) as i didn't have a combat ship to hand when i saw the event kicking off... but it still has a warm fuzzy feeling about it.of course, internal affairs would need to oversee a reintroduction of events, and care would need to be taken to ensure no corruption would mar this incarnation. given that both hardin and jade have expressed satisfaction with the procedures in place following t20gate, i am inclined to think ccp runs a far cleaner shop than it did.obviously, the rewards would need to be carefully monitored as well as the conduct, and the events should not merely be shows that can be gatecrashed but must take into account player interaction. one constant would be the \"blue text: get lootz!\" syndrome. given that event \"griefing\" will be inevitable, it can be planned for, and mechanisms like temporary standing hits or docking-denials can be applied easily to manage the problem.it also seems the sort of thing that white wolf could have a field day (or better yet, many) with. they do world-building stuff don't they? so, perhaps now there would be no need for oh-so corruptible volunteers?"
"i think that jade raises a good point here, and support it 100%. bring back the ingame events ccp please!"
"as ccp zulupark says here, they will return soon.yes please, and thanks. :-)"
"yes to players affecting the story. so long as it's done well.more small events, allowing players of all abilities to get involved would be good.multiple events at the same time, so people don't all crowd into the same place.loot shouldn't be a motivator, it should be about being able to point to news stories and say \"i was there!\"consequences to your actions. if jamyl sarum's out and about, and you shoot at her, you (and maybe your corporation) should expect to be -10 to the empire and allies for a long, long, time. this might sound drastic, but it is also an opportunity for people to say \"see how hated i am by the empire, well, i didn't get that way by shooting their navy, no. i took a shot at that witch sarum herself!\""
"karishal and the defiants. thats it."
"this.there's nothing quite like the feeling you get when you're reading about an event you were present at."
"a topic so near and dear to my heart. i do wonder if there is a repository of some sort outlining all of the events that have taken place, how many folks were involved in each, what the result was in the short term, and what the implications were long term? the example jade uses is a great one in terms of far reaching involvement by many players...but it's just one of so many. new players are being stiffed, to be honest.emperian age should've been a triumphant culmination of so much actionable storyline, made manifest through the biggest live event of all: faction warfare. instead, fw is stale and lifeless. the precident that brought the story to where it is has been wiped away and we get soundbites to fill in the blanks instead of direct involvement. fw needs a lot of other work to be sure...but a return of live events would go a great long way to making us feel involved in a living galaxy. it's like the difference between looking at a beautiful painting of...oh, i dunno...a beach, vs standing on that beach, feeling the wind in your hair, the sand in your toes, and smelling the salty air.don't make us look at the picture, ccp; bring us into the picture."
"just like some others i regret that the jamyl sarum coronation wasn't for the players (i acquired a navy apoc especially for it to show off) .but i don't think it would be realistic that those thousands of players could be enjoying regular events by a in comparison limited staff.there is my desire that there would be an event or ultimate mission where the 'end boss' would be a ccp controlled character."
"not everything can be done ingame, but as an \"ingame or it didn't happen\" person, i do certainly support this."
"as evanda said, i and my alt both support this. i'm too new to have been in on any of the events but... well. to my mind it sort of comes down to a basic thing. i started playing because it's the kind of game that i'm a sucker for but i started getting tired of just shooting things, so i started trawling the forums. i did a lot of poking around and came across the rp side of things and... well. it's obvious where i went from there, i suppose. why, though... the reason i got so excited was the thought that what i could do could affect, in some tiny way, history... i mean, look at all of the event results, and every so often i hear about other things that shaped how the in-game history went. and while i'm not going anywhere because of the interactions with the other characters, the main storyline... i don't know. i agree with the general sentiment that the news articles just feel... more and more flat. not poorly written or anything, but i remember corp and alliance members going to malaken for the relief, or talk about muritor, or any of the rest.a lot of people are mentioning the coronation, and i agree about it, but another thing like skarkon and the angels prior to the fw kickoff. we, republic loyalists are sitting there arguing about it icly but oocly? there's no scope for doing anything about it so we just get frustrated, and then a few days later it resolves itself anyway. i mean, i love the game, and i love the people i'm playing with, but the news and background sometimes seems it might as well be happening in some other game for all i can affect it or vice versa. it's neat information, mostly well written and interesting, but i love and play this game."
"live events again would be a good thing !"
"here's hoping ccp listens."
"i never saw any of the live events, having taken a long while to get into eve. that said, the very idea exites me to no end. something along that lines would make me feel a part of the game universe. as it stands now, and especially since the induction of fw, i feel nothing less then as seperate from the story as i feel in wow. the backstory from eve might as well be put in a book, since that's about how much it seems to affect my stay in the game.however unlike wow, this is perfectly fixable it seems from what the others say, and i wholeheartedly support such an endeavor."
"conditionally supported.live events performed by organised and enthusiastic roleplayers with no rewards for players beyond the experience and advancement of the plotline (so no accusations of favouritism / foul play) would be great."
"supported."
"supported!"
"while i don't honestly think you could have recreated the awesomeness of the coronation ceremony in game at this point, certainly something should have been done."
"agree whole heartidly, i miss all those live events, didn't get to see many but was always a nice feeling when i passed one by, or read about them on the news reels."
"support"
"supported \o/however, i would like to see it made sure that theres itleast a chance non-big names can get involved in this sort of thing if they want to, instead of seeing the same names over and over again (which you do if you go look at old articles)i mean you'll still get all the old players going \"oh well it was so much better when i started\" or whatever but still."
"there was one event that gave me some awesome stuff. here's the list.wardec from pie that became a mutual war lasting up until the first day of fwwardec from cvawardec from vvalliance with phoenix wingalliance with caffcoalliance with lion's emporiumwe were already close with nmtz but they threw decs in support of us and we flew togetherjoint fleets with ushra'khancoordination with fimbulwinterthe chef!

"i took part in a few minor events, and it was interesting to see how the outcome made a difference in the larger ones. i fully endorse this product and/or service."
"sounds good."
"ghost training needs to stay out ... to quote/paraphrase so many others - training is part of the game, and if you want to play you need to pay."
"i am about to take some time away from eve, but i will continue paying for this game to train skills, so gimme a queue please?"
"yep."
"approved"
"sounds good to me, skill changes during downtime and middle of the night are a bit of a pain"
"skill queue please"
"signed, get it done ccp"
"/signed/signed/signed one million f**king times...i already lost almost 9 hours to the server issues today, and still losing time...still can't make it past char selection window and i am still losing valuable, paid-for skill training time...so yes, a skill queue would be nice!"
"vote yes on question: skill queue.i often don't even have access to the pc at the times the skills end. a one skill queue at minimum is necessary and external access would be great."
"actually i hope a skill queue is never implemeted.use evemon... plan the taining. i've never had a problem with with it and i work full time.as for unscheduled downtime... well you lose a few minutes or some hours of skill training. yes, that is annoying but it is not a reason to make a massive change to the way eve's training works."
"got my vote"
"a skill queue is probably the only thing missing from eve.this topic has my vote and i only hope that ccp will implement it.vote++;"
"supporting this tbh"
"you have my support(and to walking in station project)"
"signed"
"omg this is soooo signed"
"guys and gals dont forget to check the \"thumbs up\" if you havent done so yet.thx"
"i am all for it.specially during unscheduled downtimes are it is really annoying..."
"don't care if it's a long queue or that level 1-5 thing or (my preference) just 'next skill'. i just dislike having to run a long skill every night to avoid 3 am skill completions."
"agreed"
"agreed, a queue would be nice"
"would be nice,"
"full support"
"i don't like signing in to change a skill and end up playing eve for hours. i am running on caffeine !!! arghhh!!!! *pulls hair out*"
"signed"
"signed"
"signed, vehemently.i may be only a month old in eve, but no skill cue of any kind was completely puzzling to me from the very first moment. you make a game with the possibility of real time advancement, and you actively advertise this feature as distinguishing and advantageous compared to other online environments... and then you basically turn it into a major real-life disrupting agent and guaranteed irritation factor all in one, by not allowing any form of pre-scheduling or cueing.if ghost skilling was the main/only reason, and it's gone now, there's absolutely no justification left for this anymore.please implement skill cueing."
"full suporting this. if not placing secound skill to traine antecipatedly, at least we could change it of game; in \"my character\" division, on eve page, 4 exemple. it would b nice, in case of long dt due to seriouse malfunctions that can hapend to anyone, even to ccp... as we all that use computors know."
"i support a skill que"
"i agree!"
"yes!for sure. got my vote. this is an important basic feature imo, i cannot understand how it is missing from a leading mmog.eve is not a flawless system (it runs on windows servers and ms-sql ffs) - there will be downtime and people will lose time for no reason, that and the fact that most (normal) people cannot always change their skills when required."
"/signedwith shadow training gone it's only fair we get something instead. besides, we are paying for every tick of the clock to train sps so a skill queue would be much appreciated in case of unforseen internet issues (curses bt at times ) or other that make it impossible to log on and change skills. not to mention the peace of mind of not having to stay up late while waiting on one skill or another to tick over before starting a long one for the night."
"thanks for the update, i was looking for the logs of teh csm meeting but gave up"
"i vote itbut what about all the setting(windows positions, size, channels, folder, etc...)"
"either this or just store them server side."
"against the nerf"
"/support"
"down with the nerf!"
"although i have great doubts about whether or not my post would make any difference i still feel the need to voice my opinion on the matter.i've read a great deal of posts in this topic, but couldn't simply read them all, so sorry if someone already posted something similar before.it's clear to me that eve needs a solution for the missing out on sp when a skill training ends during off hours ( both server related and personal off hours ).most of the discussion so far wasn't so much about the need of a solution but more about how to shape the solution.i don't really mind how it's done, as long as it gets done, one way or the other.some of the options are:- automatic skill rollover to the next level of the same skill.- skill queue, either unlimited or limited.- sp queue making skill points been queued up for later use.my personal favorite is the automatic skill rollover.automatic skill rolloversthis includes the game functionality to automatically move on to the next level of the same skill after skill training is completed until the last level of that skill is reached.pro's- skill training will go on as long as you haven't reached level 5 of that skill, making it easier to plan skill training for the off-hours of sleep, work or even vacations.- would still require players to actively log into eve to change 1 skill training for the other.- would probably involve the least of programming- is easy to understand for all playerscon's- would allow players to train high ranked skills for months without logging into eve.i even doubt if the con i was able to come up with even is a con. since it's no longer possible to train skills while your account is deactivated it means that every skill point trained is actually payed for. i think that's what really matters. progress in eve isn't solely reached by skill training as it requires personal training, exploring and isk making as well to make a good pilot.so if someone wishes to train long skills without actually playing the game i don't think that would hurt anybody really.i think this is the most promising idea of all as it's easy to understand and has a natural way of limiting the amount of skills placed in queue.cheers,digaph"
"qft.honestly, the thing that always bothers me about threads like this. a ccp rep talks about the thing in a way that is almost a borderline flame considering how angry the players are about the issue. 7 pages later, no one else from ccp has said anything on the thread.are they waiting for someone to agree with them that it's a bad idea?i support a queue, hell it's the only issue that brings me out of the woodwork these days."
"tbh, all i wan<U+FFFD>t is a skillque that takes 1 skill.like if i train lets say large pulse spec lvl 4, but finishes at 3am in the night, the skillque would allow me to que up 1 extra skill, lets say the last 10 hours i have in amarr battleship lvl 5. when that skills is done, i manually have to set a new skill to train.this way people still need to login and \"play\", but don<U+FFFD>t have to take a de-route off their skillplan."
"i'm pretty sure that this boat has sailed - jump freighter owners would be apoplectic at any changes to these mechanics, and justifiably so given how many billions they've sunk into the things - but the vision is a good one. the trick is, how do you remove jump freighters and jump bridges, at least functionally if not literally? about the only solution i can think of is creating some sort of \"conduit sovereignty\", such that you can't just jump past systems somebody else controls. the mechanics of implementing that, though, are utterly brain-melting, and they'd totally mess up legitimate military travel - a jf can slow-boat, but a carrier can't. here is, in broadest outline, the closest i can come up with to a solution. covert travel(black ops-based) has jump harmonics 2, military travel(capital-based) has jump harmonics 1, and civilian travel(jump freighters, rorquals, and large-cargo ships through a bridge) has jump harmonics 0. justify it as civilian manufacturers not investing in expensive military widgets for their cargo carriers - it's not like container ships have combat-capable radar irl. jump harmonics 2 allows for all sorts of ludicrous things, like piercing cyno jammers, holding a cloak through jump, all that stuff. jump harmonics 1 allows for normal activity - bypassing the odd enemy system, jumping into an enemy system with no jammer, and so on. jump harmonics 0 means the path has to be absolutely pristine, with no interference whatsoever. you might require a module for this effect - a jump inhibitor, needing sov 1, with a ly or two of range, where a jh0 ship gets stopped by one, and a jh1 ship gets stopped by like 5. it means you can still jump caps into border systems, even without dropping inhibitors, but your jf logistics chain is utterly screwed. and in order for the blockade route to work, you'd need a mobile jump inhibitor too - maybe make a new capital to carry it, or stick it on one of the existing supercaps. you'd basically need to implement a civvy cyno for this to happen without annihilating the jf market, so that they still have a use in empire, and you'll see a lot of enraged alliances at the far edge of space. but that's about the only way i can think of to put convoying back into the game without using the nerfbat to break limbs."
"yeah... the more i look into jump tech. the more its obvious that if you got all the fuel you need... its very easy.it would be better if there was a way to buff the freighters to encourage more use of them and give them a chance to break blockades."
"this is much needed ccp.everyone (inluding you gm's) have a real life. i know several people in game who, in rl are part of their countries military (including myself). the way the world is at the moment, means long time away from home, and without computers. it's bad enough to get back and find out that the part of 0.0 you lived in is owned by someone else, but then to find that you've wasted x amount of months away, you haven't advanced in eve at all. it would be nice to put two long skills on, one after the other..so at least in the months away, we'll have learnt something..i don't understand why ccp haven't implemented this. it's much needed, and they have no comne back as to why they won't implement it. so what if people don't play for two hours instead of 30 seconds to skill pop? ccp still get their numbers of people logging in. people will still play, adding a skill queue won't stop people from playing the game for hours on end, afking it at work and such. it is something that almost 100% of players want...yet ccp haven't implemented it? how would ccp feel if people just cancelled their accounts whilst they were away? losing more members, and then people have very little reason to log back in as they have to re-active their accounts?come on ccp..why don't you listen to the paying customers for once?"
"i don't see why this keeps coming up, in some form or fashion, over and over. the whol;e ordeal seems pretty clear:us: can we have a skill que please? them: maybe, we'll look into it and see if it a good thing for ccp and it's players.it is what ccp has said again and again. what's to ponder? you think it is your right because you demand it? relax, they'll work it out. if you don't like the results of the decision vote with your dollars/euros, quit. seems simple.i like the op's spin because he talks about his experience, not our experience. to conclude, if i was waking up in the middle of the night, or avoiding my responsibilities in real life to change a skill in a fantasy space game- i might have to take a deep look at myself and what is really important in my life."
"i've read quite a bit into the subject of skill queues and come to believe that the only real reason not to implement such a system is the fact that there are people currently managing multiple accounts just to sell trained characters as soon as they finished training a certain amount of skills.assuming that's the case the following should also be taken into account.i've played eve for about 1 month a year ago and stopped playing as i couldn't fit eve into my daily life and seeing the gab between my skills and those of players years ahead of me only grow larger and larger made me conclude eve wasn't the kind of game i was able to catch up in.like myself several friends also stopped playing eve for the same reason and from what i've read many more accounts get deactivated on a regular basis for this reason.not implementing a feature that would allow players with less playing time to keep up with skill training is costing ccp many accounts already.next to that i strongly believe that if it's easier to learn skills ( read plan skills for longer periods ) the need some people may feel to buy a pre made character will drop as well, making the single argument not to implement such a feature suddenly weight a lot less.so i totally agree to the need for a queue system in eve one way or the other.cheers,digaph"
"i agree 100%!!!!!a skill queue will not effect my game playing time at all! i play all the time and i still find it annoying to have to check skill training times, etc.we need a large skill queue!!!eve should have a system that is similar or even identical to what is offered by evemon. utilities such as evemon are popular because they are a needed and very useful utility. the obvious popularity of evemon should tell ccp that utilities such as evemon are necessary and *must* be implemented in-game."
"what dosr of trouble could this cause, ugly eve code strike back or what is the excuse now?"
"agree with op, the excuse ccp has given just isn't valid.giving us a skill queue would be one of the most player-friendly moves ccp could do. there is clearly a demand for this and it was on the drawing board for years yet from the way zulupark was talking suggests that implementation has never seriously been considered. please stop brainstorming new reasons why we can't get one and gieve!!!"

"tourney needs a come back! the previous tourneys have made for some of the most enjoyable eve play i've had. the build up the weeks before brainstorming setups, and then the 2-3 weekends of the tourney are some of the best memories i have from the game"
"hell yea, the previous tournaments have been awesome"
"with all due respect what more did ccp expect than pages upon pages of support when they asked the question?"
"looking forward to the next tourney is sometimes the only thing that keeps me playing eve. definitely continue with this tradition, as its the best video gaming event i can think of. i actually know of non-evers who were watching the eve-tv broadcasts of the tourney with great interest. so in addition to being a lot of fun, i think its probably also your best advertising."
"it a daft question, eve is a mostly a pvp game, the gladatorial combat arena of the tournament is the ultimate test for pvp players and as such is the best showcase for the game there could be."
"yes"
"yes"
"yes plz"

"the first every nerf i'm glad about"
"support"
"i like most of the changes ccp are planning"
"i agree, a terrible decision. the \"mood\" of both ig and oog forums is muddled by mixing the two."
"a pretty straight forward idea. a corporation issues a contract that states the following for the bonds in an offering.face value of the bond. (for example 100,000,000 isk which would be what the buyer would pay, and get paid back at maturity.)the time to maturity. (10 weeks.)the interest and coupon payment. (so a bond at 6.5% interest would pay 6,500,000 per coupon.)a coupon time period. (2 weeks, so once every other week the bond holder in this example would expect a payment of 6,500,000 from the bond issuer until maturity.)callable period. (how soon a bond issuer may pay back the principal, and not need to make any remaining coupon payouts. so say five weeks.)there should be no system put in place to guarantee these contracts. this is mostly just a way to help those who issue, and buy bonds from one another keep track and receive payment. it can be taken a few steps more forward, in that they could use the current share system somewhat, in that a bond buyer receives a item like a share in there wallet, which is just called a bond instead. and the issuer can just payout their bonds, like they do their stock dividends. the main difference here is that they can choose to payout a specific set of bonds, where as a stock system makes you pay out to all shares of the corporation.also bonds should be able to be traded to help a player run market start up. a bell and whistle would be some sort of rating/credit system. so people could know how reliable/honest from past bond buyers a corporation has been in honoring them. perhaps just a simple link that shows percentage of yay or nay to a specific bond issuer and the total number they have issued. but really people should do their research into whom is issuing a bond, and not just go buying these contracts blindly and expect to be paid as this system would just be for the benefit of issuers and buyers book keeping and payment managing, not a guarantee of payment on the bond itself.thanks."
"i'm entirely in favour of better financial instruments, so long as there's no more guarantees than there are at present."
"not to sound too harsh, but i'm kind of against this idea for the following reasons1) it sounds like this plan would severely increase the number of moons in every system - which means to properly defend an area you would need tons more pos's2) it appears to be a logistical nightmare for pos's in general which means would be insane to program (let's face it here, this is a total reinvent the wheel idea).3) it's really convoluted and is honestly adding tons of busy work.ccp's plan isn't the greatest either, as it is going to severely up the cost of the low end moon minerals.what would have been cool is to take some of the less desired \"rare\" moon minerals like thulium and give them some sort of conversion (fairly cheeply) into the other moon minerals and vice versa.also, if supply is the issue, upping the amount of those rare moons, and moving them around to balance 0.0 some could also be idea's"
"definitely a better long term solution. allowing (some) lesser moons to be inefficiently converted to the two coveted moon minerals is only a stay of execution, not a permanent fix."
"this is intentional. part of the reason that moon materials are in short supply is that space isn't efficiently moon mined across the entire spectrum of moon materials, especially where you have higher value moons. it also goes in line with sovereignty requirements since under current mechanics, having more pos's will mean that the alliance is inherently defending itself against pos-spam, and given ccp's idea of changing sovereignty to borders and stargates it'd be less of an issue to expand the areas they defend beyond a single constellation.only in terms of producing more probes for running the pos's. remember, this will probably happen anyway with ccp's idea of fuel pellets, so you're probably going to have to manufacture all the consumables that go into a pos.so yes, there is more work there, but the intention of my idea is to move the onus of moon mining from a seriously flawed and considerable annoyance in the managing of the pos itself to the continuous probing. the management of the pos's should become easier, with shorter offline/online times and larger silo capacities, since more work is put into gathering the fuel and more work is done probing the moons.not really, as explained above. but the same could also be said when complexes were removed in favour of exploration sites... no one really complained about that...well the idea of one material substituting another is quite frankly stupid. what next, a few trit and some zydrine replaces morphite? it's a ridiculous concept for a whole variety of reasons. first that there's a fine balance of how materials are used throughout the t2 supply chain, second it creates a dangerous precedent. and why? all because alliances have managed - very admirably so - to create a cartel, and ccp haven't done anything to scale resources with the number of people in game. so the issue of moons all boils down to the fact eve is overcrowded. the best idea is to simply expand eve considerably. and by expand, it'd need to be in the order of 8-12 new regions, not just one like black rise.this idea creates a mechanic whereby moons can be changed by ccp to balance the needs of the game as a whole. if dysp is in dire short supply, simply seed more moons per area, and because there'd be a natural churn of the moons, those moons would be seeded transparently and fairly in the game, ensuring supply is increased. that's the fundamental 'pro' of this idea - it simply provides more options for managing supply."
"i'd say spawn more rare moons... (eve is growing, the number of moons aren't)also, spawn more moons! :p"
"well, despite what you think this would be a major code change. first changing how moons currently work, how many moons are in the system, randomization of moon minerals, how pos's work, etc etc.pos's currently are coded to stick/bind to a moon, if the moon disappears what happens to the pos? is it going to offline? if so, what happens to the defense of the pos? if it doesn't offline, am i still going to waste the extra fuel/probes every hour even though i'm not gaining anything from it? on top of which, ensuring that moons don't get over populated with high end minerals and an even spread of moons throughout the system, all of this is going to take huge number crunches at system start-up, not to mention if a node crash occurs.and honestly, we already have enough troubles with pos's not working properly as it is.you are right, the general idea of alchemy from one mineral to another is stupid. though on the same hand, only being able to use one type of mineral is also stupid.for example, think if today we still used steel to make car bodies instead of aluminum. this game doesn't really factor into substitution of minerals, and is very statically coded in the creation of things, unlike real life. so, this is why alchemy or a major redesign of manufacturing is needed."
"i propose changing the autopilot approach distance to gates to 0 km instead of 15 km. it seems reasonable that since ships can warp to gates at 0 km, the autopilot should be able to do the same. the 15 km crawl to the gate makes using the autopilot too risky in most cases. even in high security space, pilots are still being destroyed while using the autopilot because they have to approach each gate from 15km along the way. please, please fix this!!"
"i'm 100% behind you. the 15km journey is ridiculous."
"you have a choice with autopilot - either you slowboat afk or you do it quickly yourself. if you have something valuable in your hold, i suggest the second route. i'm all for better automation of information-gathering and the like, but for actually playing the game, do it yourself."
"i second that...autopilot is an excuse to be lazy... if your going to be afk and you have valuables in your cargo hold... dock the thing at a station or go to a safespot.otherwise do it yourself.if the feature was granted... people would start throwing a fit about gatecamps... and i'm sure that will go over very well....not."
"mmmmm nah the warp to 0 feature was enough lazy, besides this is one of those thing that can be argued by role playing ex: since your autopilot is an on board system, your on board system could malfunction sending your ship straight into the gate blowing you up hence the need for the 15km range for the safety of your pod."
"what's the general consensus (good or bad idea) on adding a window to look out when a player is docked in station?i think this is something that could be useful in countering the station humpers ... what are they afraid of, that someone might fit a ship while inside the station and would go out and fight them?"
"absolutely silly solution, but i support a fix.my idea would be making the cloak an insane drain on capacitor for anything other than a role ship. i.e. in order for a non-stealth ship to warp from a safe spot, they'd have to be visible for long enough to recharge their cap. true, if they have some cap injectors they could speed this up, but people would have to alter their fittings across the board to accommodate. or you could make the cpu penalty higher. oh this is fun to think about. :d thumbs up."
"today there was an outage that supposedly required a 30 minute outage for eve, but then the problems persisted. even if eve was off and on periodically, it still was not reliable for any players to initiate any large-scale in game operations (missions, fleet ops, etc).i understand there's one hour of each day set aside for daily maintenance. however, for server problems and other outages that make you shut down eve for a while, all players should have their gaming minutes extended in proportion to the amount of time that eve was rendered unplayable/unreliable."
"yeswhen we where able to keep training without an active account i could see not reimbursing game time. ccp didnt want to be giving away stuff for free and i agree with that but with unexpected outages we are paying for a service that we are not reciving. even games like \"wow\" replace time lost due to server crashes. please not have worse customer service than \"wow\" that would be really bad"
"read the user rights bit, theirs nothing in there about being able to fly spaceships around the tubes of the internet."
"your given training time for the outage.... provided your a \"paying\" customer.otherwise your wasting your time.the only time i'll see them compensating us for anything of that nature would be if the game was down for 12 hours or more.even then.... your training never stops provided your paying for your account./me grumbles @ op/me thumbs down"
"faction warfare is on a spiral downward due to outside influence from neutral corporations and alliances with goals to remove faction warfare corporations. we have seen it affect both caldari and gallante militia as corps are leaving due to war decs. we believe if it continues on this path faction warfare can and will go away which would be a shame for the new players. a few points and solutions to the problems as we see:1. no corporation within said militia should be able to wardec another corporation in the same militia. this seems simple but has happened. if you are in an alliance can you wardec another corp in the same alliance? this first point must have been overlooked.2. treat wardecs against militia corporations as if you are deccing an alliance. if you dec one corporation in any of the mitlitias you are deccing the whole militia with fees inline with deccing an alliance.3. in any of the militia high sec if you are an opposing faction you deal with both that militia and the militia npcs. if a corporation decs a militia corporation and they choose to bring the fight into that militias high sec, the npcs should assist said militia against the agressors.4. if any corporation in the militia decs any corporation outside of the militia since they are agressing remove the help and safety of militia npcs.faction warfare is a great training ground for new players and has the potential for great things in the future but only if it survives. please voice your opinoins on the subjects posted."
"i have watched faction warfare go from 60v60 fights -> 40v40 fights -> 20v20 fights -> current state where i am lucky to see a mixed roaming gang of 5 cruisers and frigates. i know for a fact that many of the gallente faction warfare corporations i enjoyed shooting have been targeted and griefed out of faction warfare, and i know several caldari corps have as well.to expand on point four:the militias, to my knowledge, were intended as a sort of \"training ground\" or \"stepping stone\" for younger and or less experienced players to learn pvp. as such, fw should be a more defensive posture. to prevent abuse, corporations within the \"alliance\" of faction warfare should receive no assistance from militia or npc militia if they are the aggressors in a war against a player corp."
"i'm in agreement with the general ideas presented here. in specific i think #2 is a great concept given that corporations participating in fw are in an alliance with each other for the greater good of the faction and should be considered a single entity for the purposes of wars. this should really cut down on the silly attempts to thwart fw in general.-vern"
"establish wardec cost based upon concord standing of both parties.- cost increases the lower the aggressors standing- cost increases the higher the \"victims\" standing.in addition the act of declaring a war lowers the agressors standing.with concord.should remove a few of the so called \"random\" wardec's.increases the risk to the agressors.does not prevent wardecs from occurring.note: no values given for standing modifiers as that would need to be determined from testing."
"the current wardec is as random as anything else : there should be established rules of engagement , where the assaulting corp has to state its reason and intent for the war. this way defending corp can mobilize itelligently and effectively. idustrial corps who do not have fighter types whoudl be allowed to auction off the war to mercs (but they themselves should also be considered fair targets) and have thier market activity limited for the length of the war thus the desired effect of a resource based war is met curtailing thier productivity. also a one sided chain of accountability needs to be implemented when mercs are involved , teh hiring corp (must be an established corp with notable assets pos,stations etc) they also be curtailed as far as marketing industrial useage reduced. just a rough idea, eve is not a nice game and that is what i like about it , just dont like the stupid \"i'm bored so lets blow up that pos just cause\" mentality"
"it's a frigging sandbox game, i should be able to blow up that pos just cause or for no reason at all, because i choose to. it's up to players to hand out justice in eve. that's why wardecs currently do what they are meant to do, and shouldn't be restricted with silly goals or expectations outside of what is communicated with the diplomats of the two warring parties."
"i'd prefer to keep my current attributes. but if ccp decides that a bloodline change can only come with an attribute change, the cost is acceptable. after all, achura only get 9 across the good attributes. all the other bloodlines can get all their non-charisma attributes to at least 7. throw in max learning skills and there isn't really that much of a difference.but the idea that players should be forced to live with a decision they made when they couldn't of known the full effects of it isn't a good game mechanic. especially when there is no reason why a one off change isn't possible.and this increased immersion brings people from not caring about their appearance to caring because they have to look at it more.when i say nerfing skills here i am referring to either a direct nerf to the skill, or a nerf to things requiring that skill. either way the skill becomes less valuable.the main difference between nerfing skills and the appearance is that when your skills are nerfed you can still fix your character by training other skills. you don't need to retrain the skills that didn't get hit.besides, what is the largest amount of time lost by nerfing skills ?months ?chose the wrong bloodline and your stuck with it forever, unless your willing to redo the years you spent on the character. including all the training you got right first time.also if ccp allowed people to reimburse skill points every time a nerf or buff came out, lots of people would change the things they can fly. thus causing a sudden shift in demand. thus ****ing off people who have large stockpiles of the nerfed items because they can't sell them, and the people who are already buying the buffed items because demand spiked far too quickly without giving supply time to change, leading to price spikes.but by making people train the demand changes slowly, giving supply time to react. meaning a much more stable market post-patch.what problems would a one-off bloodline change cause ?"
"oops delete plz"
"you should be posting this in the tech support forum... not here.we don't deal with hardware problems.hardware requests perhaps... but not bug fixes.you won't get anything here."
"unfortunatlly there have been various threads open on this issue on tech forum and bugs reported, but it seems ccp is waiting all us throw the card thru the wc so they can forget and stop ignoring the bug. this is the only reason i'm opening a thread over here not other.oh well i can stfu and go buy an other card or not play eve."
"honesty... its not worth waiting around for a bug for a game your having to pay for anyway.i'd toss the card and get a decent \"high capacity (vram)\" nvidia card and be done with it.: o )"
"hello all, my first time posting an idea here, but i just got done reading the empyrean age book by tony gonzales (good book btw) and there was a part in there that mentioned a technology in use (don't want to spoil parts of the book) that completely changes the way a person looks, i.e. a caldarian being made to look like a gallentean. obviously the game version wouldn't be that robust, limit the player to race, sex, and bloodline like the portrait swap rules. maybe a service offered at a few stations that would allow players to add or subtract small details like implants/cybernetics that you can see, jewelry, tattoos, etc... it would offer players something else to interact with and provide more ways to make your portrait/avatar stand out. just a thought :-)"
"i would like to see the ability to change the background and lighting, with out needing to do an entire face swap."
"be nice to upload own face, and use as avatar"
"changing of the backgrounds/lighting could also be implemented, because i highly doubt that your character would choose to stay in one spot all the time :-p maybe a feature where you could take an in-station screen shot and use it as your portrait, once they introduce walking in stations anyway, somehow i can already see portraits of drunk players slumped over bars uploading your own face could be fun, it would definetly provide that difference from all the other players, unless you have a twin, maybe they could put it to where you upload your own face and then add tattoos, implants, etc... defintely create your own identity that way."
"i don't make a habit of suggesting changes to things such as character info etc. however, it struck me that a 'last logged in on...' when you looked at a character in buddy list (or just looked at a character that was offline) might be useful. it might be useful for corp ceo's etc to see how active members are...anyway, post support/suggestions/problems etc below!take care,arithron"
"my first inclination is to say that's too much information, but i'm not actually sure that it is. it's something you can collate easily enough just by adding them to your buddy list and making notes, and this is just an automate version of that. i might put on the qualifier of it only showing logons that you've observed via buddy list, but aside from that i can't really object. now, i might argue that the buddy system needs an overhaul to slow down its use as intel, but until that happens, the grunt work of assembling data should be done by the computer. that said, for it to do what you suggest for ceo's, it'd have to show the last several logons - they can already see most of the relevant information on the last logon in the corp screen."
"i've played games that had this feature, and i wonder why it hasn't been implemented already. signed."
"pretty sure you can already see this info in the corp management screen..."
"you can. well the ceo or anyone with permission can see when a member has last logged in."
"would you work towards having ccp introduce some corp icons other than more skulls and crossbones? maybe some asteroids/rocks and mining looking things? that's enough to get my vote."
"would you support the introduction of new industry icons for corp logos? i mean don't we have enough skull and crossbones? how about some industry icons, asteriods/mining. doesn't seem that hard of a thing to do. that would be enough to get my vote."
"well bad enough you made it to csm once.you only care for one aspect of eve - the carebear side. imo every candidate should not only have experienced every part of eve but also care for the balance and the uniqueness of this game.you don't!!and i can only hope people wake up and don't vote for you a second time.and btw, jade supporting you is everything but advertisement"
"this is simply untrue. i think everyone who has worked with ank on the current csm will affirm she is an open-minded, hard-working and impressively visionary candidate who is prepared to consider any side of the game and ask many questions to gain whatever knowledge she might lack.outgoing csm chair's congratulations to a hard-working and diligent csm delegate? i'd say that was quite a significant endorsement actually. ank has won my respect and i've absolutely no hesitation in commending her to the electorate for a second term."
"that's just ignorant of you. i find her viewpoints on a lot of issues to be rather bizarre(\"it's not real if it's possible to ever lose it in the future\" is incomprehensible to me), but she does care about pretty much the whole game, even if she only really plays one style of it herself."
"really, how do you propose that all candidates experience solo play, or joe-average play with an income of 10 mil a week? i also don't see many candidates that are hardcore factional warfare players either. or do those parts of the game somehow have less value according to you?what i think is important is being open-minded and the willingness to research to compensate for the aspects of the game that the candidates do not have hands-on experience with.as for balancing, i think everyone can agree that the suicide gank rebalance (cause that's what you're whining about, is it not?) was done from a game-balancing point of view, instead of a carebear point of view. when i was at the real life meet a few days back, i had one of thsoe guys whining about me that i nerfed suicide ganking and that he lost his source of easy money, as his gank ships paid out more insurance than it cost his alliance to produce them, and he would also get fat loot in the process. do you think such a system is fine if you look at it from an objective game design viewpoint?keep in mind that i said to ccp that suicide ganking should remain possible, but it should not be a consequence-free easy-money source which risk-averse players exploited.and funny that you say i supposedly only care for the so-called carebear side, but that i have factional warfare, sovereignty and 0.0 warfare mechanics on my agenda. you do know i'm one of the top factional warfare players, right?if you think that the current csm people are bad, how about running for it yourself, instead of flinging mud from the shadows?"
"about fw - i'm sorry ankh, but i feel it necessary to point out that i am running and am an ex-factional warfare fc from the amarr militia. i have made addressing the ills of factional warfare part of my campaign (does that make me hardcore fw? )"
"i suppose it does. but you'll still answer to your divine commodore! i'll try to get as much fw things fixed in the little time we have left, as i got purpose, rewards and goals of fw as well as the complex spawning mechanics on the discussion list for the fanfest ccp meeting now. but fixing fw is a long-term process."
"see you there :)take care,arithron"
"hey all, i want to say that i flew with scagga for about 6 months ish and, i must say he is defenitly there for others even if they r red lol. my point is, hes the person for the job and hell get it done. my vote goes to scaggao7"
"hello scagga re: your election campaign......i approvehowever i would like your opinion on a few subjects.1  how will you make access to 0.0 space more `friendly to casual tourist types. i dont mind getting ganked once there but i would like to have a reasonable chance of making it to somewhere deep within 0.0 without having to use an interceptor to out run all the banks of warp disrupters. 2- what will you do to prevent the inequality causing eve to become a `voiceist society. the `you cant join this corporation or other unless you use a voice program mentality must be eradicated. not everyone wants to use sound and should not be discriminated against for their beliefs. 3- piracy you say. what will you do to make the everyday life of the average pirate more agreeable. may i suggest a bespoke ore theft ship, with the cargo capacity of an industrial coupled with the tank and firepower of say.....a drake?you are without doubt one of the real `characters in the game today and you deserve your chance on the committee. i whole heartedly declare my vote to be yours sir.slartix"
"if i had a second vote, it would go to scagga."
"in regards to your questions:1- from my personal experience, i would agree that simply 'getting' into 0.0. can be a challenge. there are, i would estimate, approximately 20-30 access points - indeed, once upon a time i believe there were even fewer access points into 0.0. since the last increase in the number of gates, the number of pilots has measurably increased. so, to answer this particular question, one approach to dealing with this problem is opening a discussion on whether it would be beneficial for the eve if the number of gates into 0.0. were increased? i have personally sneaked in an out of 0.0. (with varying success ), but before concluding that there ought or ought not be more entry points, i would take the fact-finding approach.also, you may have read somewhere in the richly text-laden posts above that i do believe that mobile, low tech bases would support the infiltration of the swathes of hostile territory that one may be presented with ingame. if these were implemented, the number of trips required between empire and 0.0 (if acting as a guerrilla) would be markedly reduced, further reducing the problem posed by the nearly omnipresent gate camp on the chokepoints.2- 'voice-ism', which i currently understand to mean an overwhelming bias towards a certain voice communication system, is a problem whose aetiology lies in the players themselves - one can choose to avoid them, for one cannot remove players on these criteria! however, more seriously, if i were to suggest a solution to this problem, it would be that the commonly available medium, eve voice, should be more attractive than the 3rd party programmes that are frequently preferred. i am one who rarely uses eve voice, having faced problems of lag and liking the ability of remaining connected to a conversation if i decide to log out. to summarise: the problem primarily lies in the choices of the player, but could be approached by making eve voice superior to its competitors.(see next post)"
"3- first let me say: eve is a hardcore game, and cold-blooded piracy is part of a hardcore game. as you may have read in the original post(s), i have mentioned that piracy needs to be looked at. i have suggested elsewhere that a pirate could have a sort of 'tactical edge' in their 'home' low security space. part of this process involves the introduction of highly useful pirate agents in low security space. now i know what some may think at this point - \"...agents? for my piracy?\"quoting a post i have made elsewhere about integrating pirates with factional warfare and giving them an edge in low sec space:\"how about, if one were to attain significantly good standings with a pirate faction, that they could get access to intelligence reports from the npc pirate via their agents?e.g. \"within a range of 5 jumps, what ships have been sighted in the belts killing our comrades, or for more malicious intentions: have you see anyone mining?\"this could spice up interactions with agents and their uses, making having good standings with a faction not only allow you to identify with them, but to have mutually beneficial relations. i.e. the pirate faction may have an agenda to harrow particular space lanes more intensively to allow for a drug smuggling operation to go about unabated. about the pirate agents: i mentioned that they should be in ships in space - their locations, as well as this hidden bases i mentioned, could change with time, allowing ccp to direct them to the areas where they can have most fun and have most interaction with their enemies.\"another post of mine from elsewhere:\"i agree - there is little support for pirate factions in this regard. while pirate npcs can infest asteroid belts (based out of where exactly?), there is little one can do to have positive standings unless one ventures to 0.0. i have previously written about the need for low sec pirate agents - perhaps hidden at moons or stations in low security space, that may give players a way of gaining good standing with pirates.ok, what about some consequences?i have thought about this, and have suggested that gaining standings with the pirates may include perks such as gaining access to 'hidden' stargates or 'bases' in low sec space, which can give them an edge. this is merely a concept, not yet at the stage of a formal proposal - so i am open for discussing such ideas. also, i would support the notion of pirate npcs not firing at people with +ve standings to the respective faction. this can make the infiltration of missions in low sec quite interesting (amongst other ideas that i have to move all of the missions with decent profit/hr to low sec). there are a few other ideas that i have spoken about that i cannot recall at this moment.right, how could this integrate with something like say...factional warfare?it is my opinion that one reason 'rp' and 'fw' doesn't seem to matter is the stark division between pve and pvp activities. i would like to see new bridges built, where agents could send you on 'assassination missions', for instance.an example: go kill a member of x militia of y rank or at least z victory points production, and bring me his corpse. you have 1 week and will receive a certain amount of isk depending on the rank / ship class destroyed.to avoid exploitation, how about creating other consequences in fw, such as losing some % of your rank if you are killed, podded and handed in for someone else's mission? \"now, regarding the bespoke ore theft ship - my experiences with a dual 400mm plated mammoth, armed with a medium pulse laser and small energy neutraliser and topped with a wide array of electronic warfare seems quite adequate!"
"i am afraid i don't have any questions for you scagga since i feel pretty comfortable you would represent my own views better than any other candidate i have seen running.good luck on the campaign, anything you need let me know."
"lord laebetrovo, you have my vote, and if there's anything i can do to help you,, let me know *salutes sharply*.\"yama\"."

"on a side note - vuk's wife is not only cool she's also beautiful.she gets my votes. but as she infortunately doesn't run for csm i'll vote fur vuk instead .on a serious note:vuk is a great alliance leader and a pretty decent guy. he lacks the ego a lot of people in power positions developed, he's got a big sense of humor and he definitely cares a lot not only for the people around him but for eve itself and all of eve's players.my name is ugor batarr and i endorse this candidate ."
"strange, but i discussed this with one of my corpmates few months ago, i still dont get it why you just can not upload your logo (under provided conditions). ccp only needs to verify it that logo is not breaking eula, or as you proposed just to add bunch of new details. after 5+ years i am still not happy with my corp logo."

"only learned to know him a few months ago when we joined rawr, but vuk knows what he's talking about and has some good ideas and points that could improve eve life for all of us ... he has the support and votes of me and my corpmagmusm.v ceo"
"while i agree with some of your campaign points, and we're mostly on the same line when it comes down to 0.0 affairs, i think you're sorely mistaken on this point.you claim to have experienced all aspects of eve, but by saying that it would be fine for corps to wardec individuals in npc corps suggests the opposite.what exactly do you hope to accomplish with this? have you considered those casual players that do not want to be in a player corporation? have you considered griefers, which would just pick on and extort random helpless players? if this system would be put in place, it would be game over for any casual solo player griefers would want to pick on, as they can run a locator agent and sit outside whatever station he's in and blow him to pieces the moment he comes out.and hideout for wardecs? the current wardec system is broken, even ccp acknowledges that, i was there when they called it a pay-to-grief system. apparantly you have not experienced eve from the perspective of a small corporation either.both are valid playstyles, and your policies do not take them into account. how do you plan to represent these people as a csm, or do you not want to represent solo players and small corporations?"
"most supercapital deaths have been because one side(or person) made a horribly stupid mistake and the other side was in the perfect position to do something about it. of the 10 piloted titans to be destroyed, only deadtear and oort lost theirs to lag/broken game stuff. the vast majority of motherships have been lost to pilot stupidity aswell."
"i use a wide range of ships.my killboard tells me that i use these ships the most:1. drake2. myrmidon3. dominix4. vagabond5. stiletto6. sacrelidgeand then some other random ships. i personally think that i have a quite good understanding of ship-fittings. eventually it depends on the situation you expect yourself to be in."
"link us to your killboard page, so we can judge your ship fitting skills."
"currently... if someone war decs a corp... that corp is forced to participate in that war or disband or use any number of dishonorable methods to escape the war'dec. mostly due to the fact that most war decs are intentionally to grief smaller corps. usually a repetitive process of pay ransom then re-war-dec them again...and again...and again. nothings to stop them from doing so other than the 48 hour period that comes with the process. do you have any suggestions for alleviating this to help smaller corps get survive without ruining the freedom to war-dec?"

"well, the csm is completely useless (proof - the previous csm did nothing) however it is a good mechanism to had out a free trip to deserving individuals. and i think vily deserves it. on the plus side:- he is a canuck.- he lives on pei; this will probably be one of very few opportunities to get off the island in his lifetime other than to find meaningful employment.- he is least likely to become an embarassment to the game unlike the goon candidates.- of the candidates, he actually has an intelligence level to quickly realize that the csm is a joke and that it is part of ccp's sick and twisted mentality to 'play' with its userbase. not that there is anything wrong with that.it isn't all smelly roses however...- even though he got me killed when he was fc'ing. :)- even though he supported mynas wormtoungue during a forum spewage match.- even though he is misguided at times and joined razor nublets.i will still throw 8 votes his way. based upon the participation in the last election, it should easily put him in contention.vily, enjoy your free trip. don't even bother to waste time on plans of grandeur to 'change eve'; just nod your head up and down whenever asked a question. if ever in trouble, use this line:'i don't have an answer for you right now but let me get back to you with one'works everytime."
"it's not a suicide question, it shows whether you're willing to sacrifice one relationship to keep many, or if you're willing to sacrifice many to keep one. if you can't answer a simple question on your quest for political \"correctness\", how are we supposed to believe you're going to make any difference as a csm representative?also, you should well know by now i control more than 20 votes in this election, which is sadly more than most people received in total towards them in the first session."
"bah, viper you know the csm has 0 impact on ccp decisions. oh, correction, csms might have some input as to which venue to have lunch (dinner would be out of the question for sure) at while on their free trip.throw the 20 votes behind him; i may throw in some more just to be safe. afterall it doesn't look like anyone else on the list is deserving of the free trip. bunch of free loaders and emo kids. sad to see ccp wasting the money that could be put to more hardware but if they are going to do it at least pick someone who deserves it."

"blah blah blah, simple fact is im not willing to sacrifice relationships. its why i play this game. your saying, would you rather screw over many? or few? and the simple answer is neither because thats how i play this game. i know you control a ****load of votes, but simple fact is once again, i won't sacrifice my morals to pander to anyone."
"the thing is though, you're going to have to sacrifice relationships as a csm representative anyway, you're not going to be able to make everyone happy.let's put it this way, if a close group of your friends in eve wanted a certain thing changed, say the wanted local removed completely and were adamant about having this demand raised though you, their csm representative; while the vast majority of eve see this as a terrible idea, which would influence you more? the close group of personal friends that you wouldn't want to \"sacrifice\" for the greater good, or would you choose instead to represent the majority of the community's viewpoint?also, don't get hung up on the \"removing local\" issue, in fact don't even bring it up in your reply, it was purely an example so you could better understand the question."
"would you support the introduction of new industry icons for corp logos? i mean don't we have enough skull and crossbones? how about some industry icons, asteriods/mining. doesn't seem that hard of a thing to do. that would be enough to get my vote."

"i'm running for the 2nd csm mainly on a platform of improving all things science/industry/market related. as a member of goonswarm i've done just about everything you can think of science/industry/market related, and have become somewhat of an expert on how the game mechanics of that area works, even better than ccp sometimes. i've previously started and run a small for-profit corporation within goonswarm that is now worth ~200b isk. as ceo of that corporation i have done moon mining, t2 invention/production on a massive scale, battleship production, and now i'm doing capital/supercapital production. i've run missions in empire. i've run missions in 0.0. i've participated in faction warfare. i've been in huge fleet battles in 0.0. i've played the .01 isk game. a lot. i've built hundreds upon hundreds of battleships in 0.0. i've build thousands upon thousands of t2 modules in empire. i've ratted. i've mined. i've hauled stuff. lots of stuff. more stuff than i care to ever think about again.the fact is if its science/industry/market related i've done it at some point in my eve career and i have an tremendous knowledge of how all of those activities affect each other. this knowledge and experience gives me a unique ability to accurately predict how changes to the game might positively or negatively affect gameplay, which is why i am running for csm."
"this guy is crazy about spreadsheets"
"seeing as trit is one of the biggest component in anything produced and as it stands to get enough trit to build pretty much any supercapital takes over 338 hours time mine the trit but only 24 hours to mine the megacyte. do you consider this appropriate, what do you think needs to be modified since you can make upwards of 4x as much mining higher end ores, which is useless if you have to worry about mineral importation?"
"this (wo)man means business, everything he touches turns to gold, even ..."
"those numbers sound about right. i did some of my own research almost a year ago exactly when they were talking about nerfing npc seeded items that yielded a good source of trit. i think i came up with about 10 hours of total mining to build a raven, with 7-8 of them being just for the trit.mining is currently a very unloved profession, even with the recent additions of the rorqual and now the orca. i would like to see mining improved substantially, one thing i was hoping to see was a compression line on the orca. in zulu's thread he mentioned it wasn't needed because there was something else coming that would make it un-needed, so i'm still holding hope for a devblog this week about that.i build capitals and supercapitals in 0.0. my operation relies on buying up billions of units of tritanium in empire each month, building a couple different items to compress all that trit + other minerals into a manageable volume, then transporting it to 0.0 to be refined to be built into ships. this mechanic is a classic example of how mining is broken, and how it needs to be fixed.a compression line on the orca would have meant an easy way of compressing empire mined veldspar, which could be sold to someone like myself at a nice markup above the mineral cost as it'd be saving me a lot of time and effort to compress the minerals via a broken game mechanic."

"0.0 is a far more expensive place to live than highsec or lowsec. you need piles of poses and outposts that are expensive to build and maintain, and you need a massive fleet presence to defend it all that's simply not needed in highsec. even if a 0.0 group earns twice what their counterparts do in highsec, they may not be any richer at the end of the day. and after you compensate 0.0-dwellers for their extra costs, it still needs to pay better than highsec to justify the risks involved in living there. given standard alliance structures, there needs to be income sources for both the alliance and the player. taxes fulfill a bit of the former, but moons and the like are also valuable things to have around - the idea that they're somehow illicit because players never see their wealth is short-sighted at best.i don't know exactly where changes need to be made, or how they should be gone about. my knowledge of 0.0 is second-hand, and i don't trust that with detailed balance work like the tweaking of income sources. but the above principles are the ones i'd use.a lot of this has been happening for years, and is continuing to happen. poses and outposts, jump bridges, and jump freighters have all changed the nature of living in 0.0 dramatically, to the point where established groups have logistics as secure in deep 0.0 as they would in highsec. in some way these changes seem unfortunate - i like the idea of laying siege to a player empire and daring them to run your blockade as you attack their systems - but those days are gone for good and we need to move forward.fundamentally, most of the changes that will take place in this regard in future are tied into the ultimate future of soverteignty. whatever new objects, new tasks, and new skills are required to gain and keep space will change the nature of what people are doing with 0.0, and hence what they need to do to live there. i expect it to ultimately look similar to how it does at present, but that's merely an expectation. as ever, the devil is in the details.i think the biggest reward is already there, in a lot of ways - seeing the work you've put in take form. you don't get a pimped out character in this game as your final goal, you get the right to say that you are a part of an empire that controls hundreds of systems, thousands of players, and hundreds of thousands of dollars. of course, you can aim for any goal you like, and i know lots who do things other than empire-build, but being a part of something like that seems like by far the most fulfilling. on top of that, those who truly have made it are generally wealthier than almost anybody else, and they get to use the top-end ships - capitals - for their intended purposes.there's a lot of value in 0.0, and a lot of draw to go there for anyone who is willing to accept and embrace risks. the primary task is to clean up all the bad things that ruin the experience, not to create new good things to bring people there.\"status\" in what sense? it's already respected by players - i've yet to meet a carebear who wasn't enthralled by tales of destroyed titans, thousand-man battles, and the rise and fall of empires. part of that is that it's a lot more dramatic when you stand at a distance and don't have to put up with lag bombs and the drudgery of standard tactics, but part is genuine respect for what happens out there. i can't really see how we'd enhance that or why we'd want to.if you meant something else by this question, please say so."
"again, this one will largely come down to the effects of sovereignty system changes. poses currently do far too many things to be sanely designed for - anything that is factory, lab, mine, jump gate, hangar, wall, fortress, and a flag for capturing simultaneously is wearing too many hats, and role separation is necessary. i don't know which bits will go where - for example, will moon miners and cyno jammers continue to sit on the same tower? - but the purposes of a pos today will need to be split into two to three structures to restore sanity to 0.0 infrastructure, and this sounds like it's roughly ccp's plan. i can't intelligently comment on what would come after that until i've seen how that works. yes. titans are completely messed-up as a class right now, and need a thorough overhaul. the best ones i've heard are ewar doomsdays, massive tanking bonuses, something important for it to do if it remains on grid, and possibly an ability to make it a real station while out of combat, but i won't claim to be able to define the details of these. motherships, instead of being built to the wrong purpose, seem to just be lacking a purpose - supercarriers are nice and all, but a remote ecm burst is not worth 10 billion. nothing else comes to mind right now, but there's always more tweaking needed. nothing i can think of right now. the most helpful thing, i think, would be better corporate/alliance management tools. people tend to do very interesting things with their space when you let them, but the tools aren't really there to support a lot of it at present, and a player-built tool out of game is going to be less useful for these things than a dev-built tool in-game. give people more useful, freeform constructions than just a single -10...+10 scale, and you might start to see more interesting social structures develop."

"as much as it pains me to bump this abomination even further, i have a follow-on question for you.given your inability to read and comprehend a relatively simple question, your inability to make what is in actuality a fairly simple decision, and your reticence in communicating this unwillingness to the rest of the player base, why should we consider electing you to a position which comprises mostly of reading ideas and suggestions, making a decision about whether or not you feel it would be beneficial to address the issue, and then communicating those decisions and the results thereof to ccp and to the rest of the player base?"
"judging from your inability to read or comprehend an answer to a question, that was only meant to provoke me into giving you another answer, that would have given you the opportunity to say \"look, now he<U+FFFD>s for something he was against.\" i would say , that i am very able and willing to make decisions.and i have to agree, this is an abnomination. an abnomination of intolerance, malevolence and the inability of some enquirer to conform to the most basic etiquette."

"i'm confused; what happened to the alliances/fw issue; it seems to have been dropped?(i note that zulupark made a vague statement in his q/a blog, but i'd like to hear more specifics.)"
"just to clarify why i didn't vote - since the voting was moved to mail/forum voting, i didn't feel it was my place to vote as an alternate. i assumed there would be ample time for all of the delegates to read/discuss the issues and vote on them and as i still don't have access to the csm only forums, felt i shouldn't be voting on something that:a) i have seen no csm discussion onb) assumed non-voting by delegates counted as a no voteapparently this wasn't the case (live and learn)as far as i am aware, alternates are only required to vote when delegates cannot be there for a meeting. since there was no meeting and this vote was conducted via mail/forums, imho there was no reason for alternate votes to be used.i think the largest issue that seems unresolved is why the current csm can no longer get a quorum for it's meetings. it isn't a new issue, but it needs to be sorted out asap as currently the situation is unworkable."
"hey there becq - okay basically i removed the alliances/fw issue from discussion in the last meeting because the response we had back from ccp from the 2nd session meeting basically pre-approved the proposal made that we were to discuss. fingers crossed the minutes from that should be published by ccp on assembly hall today having been approved by all sides and they'll show that ccp is aiming for a roll-out of alliances in fw (limited by appropriate standings) in early 2009. it was pretty much as ugleb's proposal and i'm pretty happy that the many issues we've pushed in this inaugural csm session have led ccp to the correct outcome in this case."
"it's a volunteer organization - i've seen more important bodies meeting less often that were habitually unable to meet a lower quorum requirement. volunteers do not attend meetings reliably, be they elected or not. it's pathetic, but it's true."
"thanks for the response, i don't see that post now, but i'll keep an eye out!so does this mean that they will be implementing stangings from factions toward alliances and that alliances will join fw as a block based on those standings, or do they intend to go with the orginal idea ccp proposed of corps being allowed to join fw using the existing mechanics while remaining in alliances?"
"especially when some or most of them no doubt have day jobs and/or school as a higher rl priority, rather than the meeting in question being intrinsic to their career. compounded by the fact that the group is spread over many timezones."
"these are actually the two largest factors. i think it's unreasonable to assume anyone's going to have 100% attendance and we all acknowledged that right at the beginning. at the end of the day your choice as a voter is always on who will best represent you and one of the choices you have to make is, do i mind that the guy i'm voting for is employed with some rl distractions or whether you prefer someone who for some unknown reason has nothing else to do with their time.both have their negatives. v0v"
"true, but i've always considered it vaguely dishonest to step forward to be on a body and not at least attempt to make every one. i've missed meetings before, but i've also resigned from a body with two meetings in my term left because i had exams scheduled over both of them - i couldn't make it, so i stopped holding a seat that somebody else might actually be able to use. i don't guarantee i'll make every csm meeting either, but i fully expect that i can keep up a higher attendance ratio than the average member did last term, never mind the alternates."
"v0v iirc the average member made most of the meetings. i know i've been to all but... maybe two and this last round of voting that i oopsed. over a 6 month period with meetings ocurring at first every week, then every other week after june i simply don't see that as bad. i find it pretty unreasonable to expect that over 6 months 9 people are going to be able to wrap their schedules around a mountain of videogame meetings. especially when those meetings require a block of an entire day. some better management could go a long way to curtailing that."

"1. 0101-04-0029 corporate email issuesccp told the csm that the evemail system is getting a big overhaul as part of an ongoing project which will see evemail revamped and made available from the web.dierdra vaal said that he is troubled by the amount of corporation emails, which notify him every time someone applies for admittance to the corporation, and ankhesentapemkah said that the podkill/new velator notifications were annoying as well.ccp zulupark replied that ccp is also looking into reducing the amount of automated email.2. 0101-01-0030 wreck flagging in pvpjade constantine explained that in high-sec wars, it often happens that 3rd parties steal loot from a conflict site. these players then only get flagged to the owner of the wreck, but not the person that killed the ship. since the owner is not in a position to do anything about the theft. he proposed to set wrecks to dual ownership, so that both the killer and victim have rights to it, and anyone stealing gets flagged to both parties.ccp greyscale answered he believes that dual ownership is not easily implemented technically and that this game mechanic was discussed internally and found working as intended. ccp is also not convinced that changes to these mechanics will benefit gameplay.jade constantine replied that he believed that dual ownership would lead to more opportunity for pvp as well as consequence to action in high-security space, and that he believed it is a bad idea that that loot theft is currently without consequence.ccp greyscale said that there is already consequence because the victim is allowed to shoot the thief.ccp hammer added that he feels ccp would be opening a can of worms if the system was changed to dual-ownership.dierdra vaal and tusko hopkins noted that the owner of the wreck is usually in no position to deal out justice, and thus this constitutes no risk for the thief.omber zombie suggested that instead of dual ownership, either the wreck could be flagged to the owners gang, who can then shoot thieves, or that it can be flagged to the killer for a limited time after which it reverts to the owner.ccp greyscale closed by saying that this issue needs further discussion within ccp and the csm but that he currently did not see any compelling reasons that warrants immediate change.3. 0101-01-0031 account securityccp agrees that the more security, the better. to improve security, the following changes are scheduled:login attempts info: will be checked for feasibility and subsequent implementation if deemed feasible. if feasible, expect it in late q4 2008 or else in q1 2009logins locked to ip address: this is technically possible. ccp thinks however that this could cause significant customer support issues for those cases when customer switch isps and forget or cant change this setting beforehand. there would be some limitations to how extensive this configuration would be if we were to implement this, e.g., only one subnet such as 128.64.* and not an extensive list such as 128.64.0.0  128.64.1.0 and 128.63.*, for optimisation purposes. the possibility and feasibility of this will be explored further.password strength bar: already in the pipes for trial users. it will most likely be implemented for other users in q1 2009."
"4. 0101-08-0032 moon miningccp is looking into the possibility of more complex distributions however would like to address some of the issues with so called alchemy reactions first. however, they must allow for empire building and resource conflicts whilst also leaving room for some random strike it rich schemes which allow more people to get a piece of the pie.5. 0101-08-0033 color deficiencywill be considered as part of the ongoing ui revamp.6. 0101-08-0035 multiple monitorthis is possible in the graphics engine but is not supported in the ui code and would require a significant rewrite. also, we wouldnt be able to do this with the map because of the seamless zoom, unless we completely rewrite the map. it should be possible to only render in part of the frame, but things like the ship hud, messages aligned to the centre of the screen, and the overview, etc, would need to be fixed. all of it is possible, but a lot of work would be needed.7. 0101-08-0036 small freightersrejoice in winter you shall.8. 0101-05-0038 rebalancing large autocannonsthese issues are being looked into by fendahl and they do see some good points to investigate mostly centered on the clip size and rof leading to some imbalance between the variants and with performance against other turret types.9. 0101-02-0039 completion of story arcsccp is actively engaged in clearing up inconsistencies and contradictions right now as part of various internal initiatives, and is working with volunteer teams and harvesting information from the wider community to try and isolate and eradicate all such storyline bugs. its unlikely though that attempting to revisit old volunteer-run storylines will be practical to do in a consistent manner due to manpower issues and lack of concrete information on everything that was going on, not to mention the fact that wrap up articles several years after the relevant events occurred seem to serve little actual purpose. while ccp is not averse to picking up old threads they remember if its deemed useful, for the most part the teams position is that they rather concentrate on improving the story going forward, and as such ccp would very much prefer to treat previous volunteer-run arcs as canonical but inactive10. 0101-02-0040 improvements for role-playingccp greyscale clarified that there were many separate issues in the submission document, and that the issue relied heavily on the forum thread, which was too broad to address anything in specific. ccp requests the csm to narrow this down and give clear prioritization to individual issues. the csm and community must rework and resubmit this issue.11. 0102-01-0041 alliance corps in factional warfareccp is looking into the possibility of allowing corps which are part of an alliance to join fw based on high standings requirements. the restrictions are aimed to ensure that only the most devote of corporations would be eligible for dual allegiance to two different entities.with jade constantine asking for a schedule, ccp zulupark told the csm that these changes will hopefully be implemented in early 2009.ankhesentapemkah observed that standing could only reliably be obtained through missions, and not all role-playing corporations might be interested in grinding missions.12. 0102-01-0042 fix precision heavy missilesccp hammer informed the csm that missions as a whole are going to be looked into due to the speed changes. they are aware of the issues with these specific missiles and will take a look at tech 2 and faction ammo. they will also look into getting heavy assault missiles to drop, as they currently do not.any changes to missiles will be rolled out to the test server as soon as possible."
"13. 0102-01-0043 pos standing fixesccp has no objections to this from a game design view however there are likely technical issues with using alliance standings for starbases which would need to be considered. the technical issues are currently not known, but ccp will get back to the csm with a final answer on this matter.14. 0102-01-0044 gate aggression timerccp would ideally like the aggression flag to persist across nodes when exiting systems however there is again technical issues with this occurring which might not make this likely.15. 0102-04-0045 buff minmatar capital shipsthis will be part of the capital ships review. if ccp identifies issues with the minmatar ships then these will be addressed at that time.16. 0102-04-0046 crane needs a power grid increaseccp mostly agrees that some pg boost is ok and this will be part of the industrial ships review for the winter expansion.17. 0102-01-0047 nighthawk needs a power grid increasewhile the nighthawk may have some performance issues, due to the lack of power output, compared to the other field command ships, the ship is not designed to fit heavy assault missile launchers and micro warp drives. ccp plans on reviewing the command ships as a whole in the future. ccp zulupark stated that there will be several balance changes early 2009, and that this may be part of it, with the nighthawk getting a good look.18. 0102-01-0048 rigged ships and cargo issuesthe issue of transporting rigged ships around space has become more widespread and ccp recognizes this is becoming an issue. ccp is looking into numerous options for transporting rigged ships around such as a new ship transport or configuration mode. repackaging the ships (which would allow the transport from a technical standpoint) really just a workaround and ccp prefers a more sensible approach to this issue and its wider implications of cargo capacities.19. 0102-06-0049 dynamic agent qualitiesccp plans to address the issue of agents and missions with a more complete long term overhaul to address many of the issues with agents, not just their qualities.ccp hammer elaborated that in the short term ccp will spread out existing agents and add more agents, to deal with the agent hubs and spreading out the population. in the long run, there will be improvements to agents and missions alike. there is no final decision on the table if and how dynamic qualities are going to be worked out.20. 0102-01-0050 factional warfare storyline impactccp have a feature design ready to go to fulfil this exact goal and have already done a test storyline which resulted in the retaking of the huola system by amarrian forces. this will be implemented once the design is green lighted."
"21. 0102-01-0051 un-nerf the bio lengththe current limit of 1000 characters is put in place for technical reasons to prevent possible exploits, and even though ccp would love to increase the length, it is currently not feasible. ccp will look at workarounds but unfortunately there are no solid ideas to change this issue.ccp hammer added to this that ccp currently has a lot of cool stuff in the pipeline that improves the social network side of eve and this may make the bio somewhat obsolete in the future.22. 0102-06-0052 buff gallente e-warccp agrees that the remote sensor dampeners are not quite as effective as they would like them to be when fitted on gallente electronic warfare ships, so ccp is considering increasing the bonuses slightly.23. 0102-04-0053 musical instruments in ambulationccp cannot go into detail as to what features are planned, but can comment that this idea has been passed on to the developers.24. 0102-02-0054 rigs need some attentionthere is a current project to review rigs and amongst other issues; introduce more size variants to rigs to allow more ships to fit them and to do some rebalancing of some of the bonuses and side effects to make some of the least popular rigs a little more useful.25. 0102-01-0055 covert ops and cynojammersccp would like to see covert cynos allowed in cyno jammed systems as well and are looking into the feasibility of any solution. ccp hopes to have changes implemented somewhere along the first quarter of 2009.26. 0102-04-0056 turning titans into mobile stationsccp is considering this idea however it will be extremely difficult to implement and they are investigating suitable solutions which provide the most benefit for time needed to accomplish the goals for titans and super capitals which is also part of the ongoing cap ship review.27. 0102-01-0057 remote repair issuesccp is investigating with the software department on the feasibility and issues of setting the remote repair effect to be aggressive so that you cannot dock/jump like other aggression types.28. 0102-01-0059 covert ops jumpbridge range yes, this should and will be extended barring any technical issues.29. 0102-01-0060 third bloodline backgroundwhile the lack of extensive data on these specific bloodlines isnt disputed, ccp is not sure that theres much less actual info on the achura than there is on the deteis, for example. ccp hopes to fill out the various imperial subdivisions in the next arc which will involve fleshing out various bloodlines, as well as doing various behind-the-scenes things which should help us to quantify where were comparatively light on solid information. assuming that the goal is to bring up the level of public information on the new bloodlines to the same level as that enjoyed by older bloodlines, this is something the storyline team should be able to work on in the near future. that said though, chronicle publishing in particular is a very tight schedule and chronicles detailing background info are likely going to need to take a back seat to story-centric chronicles for the next few months as ccp has a lot of ground to cover30. 0102-01-0061 motd for fleets and gangsin addition, corp. and alliance chat channels as well. from a gd point of view however, the reason is mostly technical as to why this is not done so far, however ccp will look into the possibility of allowing this."
"31. 0102-06-0062 bounty hunting improvementsccp greyscale explained that ccp has had bounty hunting and mercenaries on the to-do list for quite some time, but that there was always a bigger project that higher priority. implementing this properly would consume a large amount of resources and development time, and ccp wants to know from the csm and the players how important they deem bounty hunting/mercenaries compared to other features such as a change to the sovereignty system.jade constantine believes that bounty hunting and improvements to high-sec warfare in general are extremely important for a large amount of players and he supports it fully.arithron and omber zombie think the current bounty system is not very sound and that changes to these mechanics add a new profession to eve and improve empire pvp significantly, as well as encouraging players to pursue targets into low-sec.darius johnson believes that compared to bounty hunting, the sovereignty mechanics are more in need of change, and improvements to this system would benefit a great number of players as well.dierdra vaal observed that ccp has requested big picture ideas from the csm, and that his bounty hunting / mercenary documents constitute a big picture idea, and wondered what ccp had in mind when they made this request.ccp greyscale explained that ccp is helped most by general directions the csm and the players wish to see improvements, and the avenues they deem worth exploring. they also want to know how important the csm thinks this issue is, and a prioritization of it. the csm does not have to go into extreme detail, as this can be filled in by the development team.32. 0102-06-0063 mercenary improvementssee above.33. 0102-09-0064 ship maintenance bays revisitedccp clarifies that this change was made because they wanted to stop people hauling stuff in carriers and they still hold this position."
"34. 0102-03-0065 missions under reviewccp hammer agrees that missions in general could use improvements. there are some concrete plans for this, which will be revealed during fanfest. he then proceeded to ask what the csm would love to see in regards to missions.dierdra vaal replied that most missions are boring and that it would be nice to see missions become more varied and interesting.ankhesentapemkah answered that in an ideal situation, she would like to see completely modular and dynamic missions, parametrically generated based on in game events, which have an effect on the game world, such as the quest system in the computer game dwarf fortress.ccp hammer and ccp greyscale wanted to know if the csm thought the problem with missions was in predictable content, or boring/too easy combat mechanics.jade constantines answer was that if missions would both be more unpredictable and challenging instead of canned content, they would be more interesting to try. unexpected challenges should appear which also provide unexpected rewards, if players want static and predictable income they should turn towards mining instead.ankhesentapemkah believed that missions do not necessarily have to become more difficult by themselves, but that there should be optional bonus objectives which can have a higher difficulty than the main mission, which provide special loot. these bonus goals would be randomly attached to some missions, so the player does not know what to expect when the mission is accepted.dierdra vaal would like ccp to focus on making missions interesting, which he notes does not necessarily mean they have to be dynamic. under the current combat mechanics, even difficult missions become boring when a proper tank is set up. harder and challenging missions should be optional, so the difficulty increase would not put off a lot of players.tusko hopkins said that since all mission solutions are currently available on various websites, there is a problem with predictability, and missions should be more dynamic.lavista vista suggested that missions could include some of the randomness of exploration to make them more interesting, both spawn and loot wise.serenity steele wondered if it would be possible to have tools available for players to script their own missions, and provide payment in exchange for kills or information. ccp hammer replied that this is somewhat unlikely to be incorporated as ccp rather creates the content themselves instead of vetting player created content.ccp chronotis said ccp is still considering what the best approach is to mission income and t1 production as well as mining. in addition, while ccp could make mining missions pay more, chronotis believes that the problem lies with boring mining mechanics rather than the mission itself.omber zombie said that all missions are effectively the same and can be completed with the same setup as long as hardeners are swapped, which also constitutes to a lack of risk, and there are complaints arising due to the fact that a lot of income is generated through these risk-free avenues.ankhesentapemkah replied to this that she believes the average eve player does not generate obscene amounts of income through missions, and that she thinks level 4 missions are difficult and not at all that profitable unless attempted by experienced players with very expensive ships.dierdra vaal believes that players need to know a lot of things to successfully accomplish things in eve, but that the execution is often rather boring and that the challenge lies in the preparation only.ccp is currently working on general mission improvements, some of which will be revealed at the fanfest, but also asks of the csm to poll player interests and gather as much feedback as possible so they can take it into consideration when making design decisions."
"35. 0102-09-0066 ui combat notificationsinanna zuni explained that the current combat notifications and logs are not useful enough and it is too complicated to view the full log.ccp chronotis replied that it would be reasonable to be able to move the notification window around as well as display more information at one time.36. 0102-09-0067 ui distance status changethis issue can be resolved but is technically very complex.37. 0102-09-0068 ui hotkeysccp loves hotkeys as well and aim to add more in the future as part of the ui revamp (scheduled over 2009).38. 0102-09-0069 ui visibility status of modulesthis is something ccp very much wants and will be part of the ongoing ui revamp.39. 0102-06-0070 ui slash commandsthe basic functionality initially seems attractive but the combination of assumed small user uptake and the can of worms it opens with regards to feature creep and player escalation demands makes it something of an unappealing prospect on reflection. ccp would rather focus on more hotkeys and usability enhancements with more general scope than adding this sort of functionality.40. 0102-03-0071 small anchorable structuresccp greyscale said that game design is currently looking into the feasibility of small anchorables, and several ideas are currently on the drawing board. possible ideas include player housing and sub-starbase logistical structures which operate on a smaller and less efficient scale, as well as tactical anchorables. in addition, ccp is exploring anchorables by which players can invest in space security in low-sec areas. small anchorables do not necessarily have to be moon-centric like current starbases are.serenity said that ccp might want to consider making small anchorables modular as described in the fancy-pos alterations thread.dierdra vaal voiced concern and wanted to make sure that ccp allowed all these anchorables to be destructible, unlike outposts, and got agreement from serenity steele and darius johnson.ankhesentapemkah agreed with the destructibility of economic/tactical structures but wanted some sort of protection for housing structures.ccp greyscale said that outposts are not destructible for technical reasons related to docking, and this would be unlikely to be the case with small anchorables. furthermore, he welcomed any further feedback and player interests gathered by the csm.41. 0102-03-0072 remote jumpclone destructionccp has no objections to adding this subject to further review and will add it to their backlog.42. 0102-03-0073 drone quirky behaviorccp chronotis said that ccp is currently looking into this issue and it is under investigation by their qa department.43. 0102-03-0074 more crossfaction shipsccp greyscale agreed that the current distribution of ships is somewhat inconsistent, but that faction ships are considered a luxury good which few players use and thus have a minimal impact on the game. to add more ships to fill the holes would require significant effort from the art and balancing department and thus will not receive a high prioritization.jade constantine and ankhesentapemkah said that content like this gives players a goal to work towards, even if a lot of players will not own these ships.ccp greyscale replied that recently a few new ships have been added and that he believes that introducing further faction ships is not currently an optimal use of resources. 44. 0102-08-0075 forum reworkingthis will be discussed in more detail at the fanfest."
"45. 0102-07-0076 kill rights should be transferablethe idea of trading killrights has been knocked around internally for a long time. the two things that have held it up are the aforementioned issues with bountyhunting which tie into this and the fact that a simple killright market lets you buy your own killrights, rendering the feature largely counterproductive.discussed as part of the bounty hunter / merc system.46. 0102-07-0077 funky pos recommendationccp thinks this is a cool idea but requires a total rewrite of the starbase system and complete art asset replacement so unlikely to happen as a result.ankhesentapemkah and serenity steele said it would be nice if ccp incorporated these ideas into the small anchorable structures they may have planned for the future."
"i know i'm like 3 months late for this, but...ahahahahhahahahahahahha. if forcing players to log in to change skills is how you encourage people to log on and play, then maybe it's time you re-evaluated your actual, what's the word... gameplay to encourage people to log in and play. w...t...f?"
"wooooow did they really realise this after only 5-6 years? damn they are fast ffs dudes, how much out of touch from their community can the devs be? this just leads to show that they have no freaking idea whats going around and have been doing so forever ;)only difference is; now there isn't the attantion on the game as it used to be and most of the income is relaying on alt accounts (which by the way is like ****ing in your pants a cold winter day, since this more or less deletes the whole idea with the identity and taking a harsh punishment for being a idiot towards others etc etc.).well all this is said, how hard can it be to set a skill queu that queu's up to 24 hours of skills (and then leave the last one going, which will always be a long skill) and then if you get a better idea later on, implement it, but for now, dudes get real and just do something to better the extreme overdue and insanity (yer i think it is insane to let something as simple as this, which makes so many people so annoyid and properly coursed more then a few to say \"screw this s... i am gone\", be overdued and ignored) in the system as it is now"
"well this..actually having to be forced to log in, is what removes my will to log in, every time i have to log in to change a skill it annoyis the hell out of me, this means that every time i log in even just to play i get that chill of \"**** i hate this ****\" feeling and gets a bit annoyid untill i am done with the stupid skill changing and can just enjoy the actual game, and then it gets back right when i log of and are forced once again to change skill to long time skills.so basically this really discurige me to play, and i just got back, logged on playid around, thought \"hmm nice...\" then was on for a few days and had to manage the skills and my thought was : start quote\"ffs this is so freaking ertarded why the hell haven't they gotten a skill queu yet, what ertard monkey brains are making this **** rable\" end quote..so no it doesn't encurage me to log on actually it discurage me, and i have once again cancelled my sub in annoince and rage over the idiocy that have overwelmed the creaters of this system (sorry for any and all use of bad languish, but it is nessasery to explain the feelings i feel about this subject)."
"i want to be able to set leve 2 and 3 of every rank 2 skill i feel like training and no worry about requeing crap every night. i also want to have cyber v finish and start seige warface specialist 4 in the middle of tuesday which is the one day i can barely even log in long enough change skills."
"i'm a wow refugee that, having read about the ability to continue skill training while not logged in, was persuaded to sign up for eve. 5 months on, i'm thinking of giving up because of the control skill micro-management exerts on one's time. it's starting to feel just like the mindless wow grind. i'm a serious gamer but, like others in this thread, i have a life outside the game. there are enough time-intensive hurdles to separate the hard-core from the also-rans - e.g. making isk, improving standings, developing one's space combat skills, running a corporation - why maintain a hurdle which requires no skill and next to no-one enjoys? it doesn't make me play more - unless you count 1 min drop-ins and afking it for hours on end while i'm principally occupied elsewhere. one wonders how much less lag there'd be if people weren't encouraged in these silly behaviours.the lack of further ccp input after so many responses is giving me wow deja vu."
"yes please. i hate having to stagger my skill training so the skills end when i can get on. sure beats having to go home to change skills instead of eating lunch or setting my alarm at strange times of night to change the skills though!"
"i'm blastil and i aprove this message.i entered pvp in a corp full of older players, and i get an earful about 'back in the day', and i've always wanted to play 'back in the day'. here's an idea- make jumping inordinately boring. i don't know how the ui looks, but if your ship is incapped for an hour or two while it flies from point a to point b, then i think people will get the message- cynoing takes for ****ing ever.jump clones ought to remain in place, since they do allow for pvp on demand, and in fact, support 0.0 logistics growth, since you have to move ships too. hell, why do carriers have corperate bays that can fit ships inside them? i've never seen anyone use them to pull a ship out in the middle of combat."
"to make things more fair for those items that respawn with specific server restarts, how about we suggest that ccp change the time of the daily system restart to say 22:00 gmt - that way when i get off work here in the us, i can come home and log in to eve-online and mine all those nice fresh roids before the folks in the other hemisphere have cleared them out ..."
"if the server reset time was changed to accommodate you then someone else would be complaining about wanting it changed to match them."
"and its the perfect time for me cos i either get out of bed just before the down time or are about to go to college.so it lets me change my skill and it wont mess around with any of my play time.so no, im sticking with the time it is now."
"ps: ccp is euro time anyway so they arnt going to be doing downtime and everything at about 10-11pm"
"uhhh, what? why would they go into work at ten o clock at night to do something they do at mid-day normally? just because you want to do some mining and think you're better than people in \"the other hemisphere\"."
"it's all about you isn't iti hope this is a troll thread."
"a better idea would be to move yourself."
"a cycling downtime would be interesting. say 3 hour increments over 7 days and reset to standard time on sunday.but i am fine without that just saying it could be interesting."
"/agreedit doesn't make me play more - unless you count 1 min drop-ins and afking it for hours on end while i'm principally occupied elsewhere. one wonders how much less lag there'd be if people weren't encouraged in these silly behaviours.i am quite sure that someone at ccp has studied player behaviour and discovered that most people, upon logging in, fiddle with their skills - some then go on to play. ccp has, from this, drawn the erroneous conclusion that those people were enticed to play by having to log in to change skills. such a conclusion is erroneous because there is another explanation for such a behaviour: people deliberately choose skills which will be ready just as they log in next."
"there are currently players, corps and alliances, yet nothing that is bigger than that.there are currently a few coalitions in eve between some alliances, but nothing to show this.so i prepose that coalitions should be added as another level of group.this would make it so all the people in that coalition is auto made blue to the other people in it and red to those that are at war wirh the coalition."
"i think there was a dev blog suggesting they were thinking of doing this awhile back. \"nations\" - i think is what they called them."

"its really strait forward and to the point. i feel that the sov need of the cyno gen needs to be removed for 2 main reasons.could allow cyno gens to be placed on low sec pos's for 0.0 logistics.could allow cyno gens to be placed on npc pirate region pos's for logistics.as it stands you have to fill up you other 2 characters slots and pay for a alt account to supply you with the cyno alts you need to get any capital ship into place. as we all saw with the ghost training removal ccp is in this for money and giving us this would remove the need for alt accounts with cyno gens, thus i don't see this happening. in the hopes that ccp one day starts to care about its player base more then its cash flow, i here by submit this proposal for review by the council and the eve community.col callahan"
"while your idea is good and fine..... i would like to think your fellow corpmates would be happy to help you with that problem.i see too many players using \"alt's\" to take care of major tasks that would be most fruitful and constructive for the team work environment.i don't have a problem with alt's being scouts... but for major operations.. should have a larger group helping out... makes for a really fun game.as for allowing cyno's to be built in low sec and what not? i don't think thats a good idea.it's already too easy for jump ships to roam about.would mess up the balance... yes iim not a 0.0 pilot....yet... but i can see there's a lot there that would take precedence.i'm going to hold off for now and wait for feedback."
"hmm well the whole moon issue is probably a sympton of a greater problem..eve growing faster than ccp can keep up with..although as a disclaimer i feel they have done an excellent job..adding more moons wont do it all the more for the mega alliances to swallow up i'm afraid and precious little chance smaller alliances and corps could access them.the current solution seems to me the most easily implemented and frankly makes more sense that erm traveling moons.it also seems to fit the current story line..in war you either conquer more resources or you invent new ways to make em."
"fixing the autopilot is not so much something that is simply meant to increase lazyness but rather to reduce the 'downtime' that a game like this generates. long trips to distant areas of space would be faster. if people decide to use it as a way to be lazy, then so be it. however, i would like to point out to those \"crybabies\" before they have a chance to complain that the hazards that have always existed when using autopilot (gatecamps) would still exist, and if you are careless enough to zip through low-sec carrying a load of priceless goodies in your cargohold by autopilot, then you deserve what you get. repairing the autopilot feature should only make it more useful, not replace the need to actually play the game.fly safe!"
"no. you want to be lazy and stupid then be lazy and stupid at 15km."
"the thing is, if autopilot warped to zero, a lot of small ships would be uncatchable by the average gate camp. you align too quickly for them to click on, lock on, and scram, and you'd land on top of the gate coming out of warp and thus jump instantly. also, autopilot doesn't slow you down. set destination, use it as a route planner, and fly yourself - assuming you pay attention, your time will be exactly as good as a user of the improved autopilot. what you suggest is that it all be doable afk, which i don't support."
"warp to zero was implemented to reduce the bookmarks more and more people had to reduce lag.if you want to travel fast you have the possibility to warp to 0 manually.if you want to go per ap you have the \"drawback\" of needing longer.it is fine as it is - ap to zero would be over the top imho.greetings belmarduk"
"good idea... but would tax the system a bit more... and even then... your just indulging in your paranoia.i have mixed feelings.. i'll sit back and wait a bit first."
"i dont like this due to the fact id sit outside a station watching docked players mooning me whilst camping"
"while it would be nice its prob impossible due to the fact that the station is on a separate server to the exterior environment."
"yea,sounds silly but i love the idea,could have not posted that at all,but i am sick of it.what would you do if you are that dedicated?i dont nano,dont fly capships,dont own a pos,dont`t build stuff.are people that afraid of a covops?why we don`t get a step further,requirements for probing \"noncloakers\" all at 5 + cloaking 5?you get rid of all wannabe/alts 15% probingskills right away.reward dedicationthere is no need for more new mods or skills,let the pro probers handle the problemdo we have some wise csm guys with an opinion on that matter,or is that iron too hot?"
"brilliant!let's see, 15 dolars a month, on average of course, that's about 50 cents a day. system is down or laggy for a couple of hours.....lemme do the math here.chaching! here's your nickel.fail. move along to the pampers isle please."
"or, let's see, 58 cents or so per customer, multiplied by tens of thousands of subscribers = a fair incentive for ccp to be on top of their game and to make anticipatory upgrades. so even that would be nice.besides, read the damn post - the request was not for money back to customers, but game time extended proportionate to when the game was down. that skills continue training is a pretty meager aspect of gameplay. if we pay for 2 months of gameplay at a time, we should actually get 2 months of when we can log in and play the game."
"what a ridiculous whine.your argument proves how facetious the request is - you point out its a tiny amount per player, but across the whole player base, its quite a lot for ccp. so.... why would they incur a big loss for themselves while not really satisfying anyone individually?sometimes a bit of downtime is unavoidable, we all live in the real world and know that these things happen. your complaint is just a tiny scion of the ridiculous compensation culture we have at the moment - had an accident? sue someone for money. game down for an hour or two, demand more time...."
"oh noes i lost 10 cents."
"it seems like they are on top of thier game. there really is very little downtime. ever read the dev blog? they are constantly improving the system. they employ patches and anticipate most problems. they usually let us know if there is going to be extended downtime. am i missing something?why some players create this adversarial relationship with ccp is a mystery to me. if you think your being cheated- quit.fail again.and i offer one more time, an escort to the pampers isle."
"\"compensation culture\"? how about just being a smart consumer and making sure you get what you pay for? if i pay for 60 days of game time, i want to actually have 60 days when i get to log in and reliably play the game. i do the same thing with my internet bill: if the internet is down for 2 days straight, i ask that my bill be adjusted to reflect that i did not get a full month of internet. my wife and i also just signed a lease, but we are moving in on an odd mid-month date. the rental company prorated the rental for us for the days of the partial month that we will be there. the point of being a savvy consumer is actually getting what you pay for. if you think it is unreasonable for consumers to seek this, then you are just a tool/fanboy of the companies and business that you slavishly hold dear, and i've got some 59 and 58 day gtc's i could sell you fro $34.99 (you don't mind, right?)"
"i agree aswell. i do not speak for anyone other than myself."
"if u remove the ability to wardec a corp in militia how do u respond to blue on blue pirating?in a normal alliance that would result in a corp ejected from the alliance, is there a way to resolve that issue without wardec? is ccp going to police this as a normal ceo of a large alliance would?? cant see it :("
"i have seen the fw decline first hand as well. my corp has also been involved with a war dec that was intended to force us out of fw. prety simple tactics, the decing corp just waits for a fw fleet, then picks off it's targets with out a worry of bring on the full blow of the fleet. this loop hole in fw will be it's undoing.my only twist on this would be that if you are a corp and you join fw, you should lose the ablity to war dec, and as your now in a larger alliance, only the alliance should choose the corps to war dec. so if a corp/alliance wants to get involved with fw corps they have to war dec the fw alliance.sure this opens up new players to more potential danger when a corp war decs the fw alliance, but it's much better then sitting around a battle going on where you can't do anything but shield rep your fellow fw pilots.as for blue on blue aggression, that should be kick from fw imho. maybe a rank drop system there instead to the lowest rank then kick. a typical ceo would not stand for it, so that should be the norm. maybe give the corp the option of kicking that player from it's ranks with in 24 hours, but if that players stays's then kick that corp from fw."
"thats gold !! ccp how about it??"
"fw was always supposed to be a small gang pvp introduction. the \"decline\" of fw is really it doing what it was supposed to do. it wasn't supposed to be 60 man blobs it started off as being.making wardecs 'alliance' wide is dumb. now instead of harassing a handful of corps in fw, a 0.0 alliance can harass the whole damn thing."
"i think this needs a bit more finesse in the aggression engine.this would work for both a corp outside of the militia and within the militia.1. you can only war-dec a single corp in the militia not the whole milita. (just like now)2. if you aggress a pilot in the militia corps that you decked you become flashy for 5 minutes to the whole militia3. once other militia fire at you you can shoot back at them with no sec-hit/concord but not before they do that.this would solve the problem where decked corps players are not safe in mixed milita fleet.if there is a griefer corps joining a milita and most of the militia aggrees that they are a bunch of ****s they can still be decked within the milita and attacked since the rest of the militia would not come and help them."
"i agree 100% we need to do somethign quick before the milita is completly dead."
"your really going to try and say that faction wars was ment to be small time? really? you can't get any more cooler then hundreds of random players forming up to fight for their cause..and come on really? 0.0 alliance don't war dec, they don't give a dam about conncord, and when they do get upset, they put up a pos in low sec and gate camp a system <cough>tama</cough> killing everything that happens to wander through...."
"definite support, especially point 3. ideally would need a separate fix for blue on blue pirating"
"i agree. fw can be a blast. it's a great way for players to test the waters of pvp in a casual setting. i think that we should make an effort to find ways to keep people interested in fw. i think, at the very least, if you are in a mixed fleet, and someone attacks a member of your fleet that they have war dec on, then the fleet should be able to fight the aggressor. this is not to say that the whole militia should be your blanket security. but it doesn't make a lot of sense to be in a mixed fleet and have a group of pilots able to pick off a couple of targets in the middle of your fleet and not be able to do much about it. i want to see something that is not slanted in favor of either side, but fun for everyone...."
"a little bit of tweaking as some of the other posts above and this'll be a great idea."
"what a great idea"
"it's fine as it is.not supported."
"something needs to be done, otherwise i fear fw may come to an end sooner rather than later. fw was my first taste of pvp, as it has been for many other pilots and it is a great idea to get us \"carebears\" started in the fighting. please dont let this fall apart ccp"
"some clarification on this point? are you proposing that it will function exactly how wardeccing an alliance works now (ie if multiple people wardec said alliance the price escalates) or will it always be the default 50m a week price no matter how many entities wardec corporations inside the militia. its an important question because if there is escalation it will quickly reach untenable levels of expense making the militia an effective war-avoidance mechanism and thats not in the interests of the game.also can you confirm that you mean if an external entity wardecs any corporation inside a miltia they will be in a full status of war with all militia corps + the militia npc entity for the wardec fee paid?thanks."
"i agree the war-deck on militia makes for bad game play.this needs to be fixed!so like the snl dude- fix it!but it easy to see why some fw corps have made the war-deck choice, fly through old man or tama, and you get to dodge the 20+ -10 players from different corps that have moved in to feast on the younger players trying to have a chance of any fun in f/w pvp. thus it was an easy bet that fw corps would bypass the low sec issues and take the fight right to the systems fw stages fleets in. once this started, it snow balled into all out war-decks even within ones own militia. it's all about targets! i too have seen a large drop in fw battles and players due to this. ccp needs to take a responsible approach at keeping the game fun for all players. is this what you had in mine ccp? should something you added to the game to help fun for mid level players be ruined? this can be fixed and fast, please do.one way:faction war needs its own space, with bubbles and bounties (a must) for killing apposing side player ships.not many players care about the plexs, the risk to reward sucks!do this and fw will be a big part of the fun for mid level players again!the -10 players and want to be pirates can go find real targets that have real skill in low sec!"
"confirming this is a heap of fun."
"that would be the only acceptable change, but i dont think you realise what you are asking for. militias would be a very popular wardec target."
"rabble rabble....rabble rabble rabble"
"i agree that something has to be done, for me fw was the way into pvp, wasn't interested in it before. but fw and wardecks together isn't so much fun."
"so you deck a corp from each on the alliances, and you are in war with all the fw alliances? works great for me :)"
"wooot that would work out well..it will be like the new privateers well tought out ideas steel..."
"not a bad idea skaxx. if u war a mitia corp it would be good to have the whole militia/alliance good bonus since we ward u guys.the sad part is that it will protect (bad word) like u guys and so on... 3. in any of the militia high sec if you are an opposing faction you deal with both that militia and the militia npcs. if a corporation decs a militia corporation and they choose to bring the fight into that militias high sec, the npcs should assist said militia against the agressors. is a bad idea why should u have an atv vs wts? but this is from us.if u should leave militia we ill still war steel.how come u never undock from station to fight. its same as in the militia just that u dont have 4000 ppl helping u.its just funny to see how mutch **** u could put out in the militia channel when the war wassnt active and now nobody see guys annymore.well ofc not counting when ur stabbd up for travelstop whining undock and fight!!!!!!"
"this post has nothing to do with the mentl dec, the apb dec or anarchy now decs we have. this post was due to the corps who are griefed out of militia. we are a mostly us pst time based corp. we are not going anywhere. we believe in the militia and will continue to move forward.there are plaguing problems in faction warfare and we do not want it to go away. of course their have already had flaws pointed out in a few of my points which is good. the more points of view a discussion can have the better."
"ofc it has to do with us!! were the only corp in militia that has decced you and isnt that what this whine post is about? getting decced by own militia?"
"do i think it is ******ed that a corporation in one militia can dec another corp in the same militia? yes. we started this post for the shear lack of war targets we see anymore. when we starting checking these corps weeks ago as they were leaving one after another was decced by multiple corporations. we do not want our opposition to go away. if it wasn't for all the good pirate corps around there would be nothing to shoot at at all in our timezone. we formed our corporation knowing we would get war decced alot. oodin you are a greifer of the worst sort. at least pirates have the balls to show their colors. you choose to shoot your own militia and have done so for the last few weeks taking advantage of game mechanics and the fact that most militia pilots are new players. i can respect pl coming into tama and camping the system, or bydi, or veto as they show their colors. you join fleets with the sole purpose of shooting your own. you hide behind your own militia to grief the newer players.i do not know if any of our ideas are worthy, but something has to be done or we will have no war targets to shoot at in black rise. i think this would be a shame. faction warfare allowed me and many others to find fun in pvp."
"suchs bull. when empyraen age was released ccp itself told in some interviews that there moving away from the sandbox concept for all erea's except 0.0. they going to lower they learning curve and making more focus on the mission part and production part in there next expansion. if you want sandbox stay in 0.0 are go play another game because ccp is going to ruine it for ye anyway"
"doesn't look like it.taken from zulupark's q&a session where he answered my question about any proposed changes to empire wardecs"
"this says it all. if you can not protect yourselves you do not deserve to be in a player created corporation or alliance.the corporations i have belonged to only seem to war dec the following corps or alliances:1. mission runner corporations who flaunt their wealth by flying faction fitted ships in front of us. spread the wealth man.2. corporations that say stupid stuff in local and irritate one of our members. if you're going to have a big mouth then you need to back it up.3. alliances that irritate our ceo by kicking him out for griefing (shooting people) in high sec. what else is there to do in high sec?"
"i'm conserned about adding objective to the wardec mechanic. eve is a sandbox. making set objectives and goals is a way to force gameplay styles on players. i say no."
"as stated before.if you don't have a pos that needs defending and is part of your corporation and your corporation is less then 50 members there a very easy trick that makes they wardec totally useless.just make an new char. make it executive commander. it'sa starts with coorporation management lvl5 and ethnic relations lvl4. make a new corporation and moce all your members to the new corporation.they will make the coorporation that declared war an you stuck with a war against an empty coorporation for a week.ccp already has added enough an different levels that you just can't call it a sandbox game anymore. in high security space with the recent changes to concord it has become a regulated game for people that are smart enough to take advantages of the added mechanisme.also holythough is right in an interview about emperyan age ccp members clearly stated that there moving away from the sandbox concept except for 0.0. this to attract new players. only uupsite for the sandbox lovers is they also clearly stated they look at more ways to make people go into 0.0 space so the become part of the sandbox part again."
"1. if they have a factional ship they already spread some of the wealth2. you get irretated by things said in local ? i only look there for people that are in that system can't be bother by wath there saying sins there normally there always a few noobs around3. if there isn't anything else to do in high sec then shooting newbies why are you even there ? go somewhere where there is something to do"
"if eve was still a reall sandbox why is there a wardec mechanisme ? and why can you only declare war 3 thimes ? answer eve isn't a reall sandbox game anymore"
"1. i didn't get any of the wealth. i think i deserve some.2. i have found a good way to shut em up is to shoot up their ships. it's also fun to pod em.3. there are 5 year old characters in high sec. i like high sec. it's fun to show people in high sec aint safe."
"ccp understands that the current system needs workthe fact that there aren't current plans to change the wardec system it is something they as qouted want to change they just haven't thoughed of a system that really appeals to them atm"
"the problem with wardecs is that it discourages people from forming corps and encourages them to sit in the npc corp, which sucks.i'd say cut the income of people in npc corps and introduce some mechanism to discourage (read: not eliminate) random wardecs...that is, not to make it impossible, but give the 3-year-old 50-man pvp corp a reason to wardec someone other than a 5-man newbie mining corp."
"introduce cosmetic surgery in ambulation. tadaaa"

"in response to jade constantine post about bringing more events to eve i decided to post thisi would love to see more npc interaction. i played a game called rappelz for a short time and there would be sieges of the dungeons. 30 min before those sieges a server message would go out and say \" x min till so and so siege\" then every one would gather at the entrance and the event would take placemy idea of incorporating that style into eve would be this. make light of the regional and constellation chat channels. the message would say something like. large hostile fleet seen in xyz constellation posted in the regional chat channel. then once you are in this constellation you would get a sos from a npc station every so many min.what is the event? well simple as this. say you are in amarr. what are the normal rats? sansha.just have a fleet of rats start attacking the npc station. the npc station will never be taken over because in the end the \"police\" show up. have it be a timer that once and event has started if none of the rats in the fleet have been blown up, then the navy show up with overwhelming forces and nuke the rats. thus ending a event that no one is taking part in.it would be able to make this easier and harder depending on the sec status of the system. so in 0.4 system have the faction navy help kill stuff and or just make the rats be in smaller easier to kill ships. the lower the security the less help and the larger the rats get. this would also get more people into low sec as there would be more to itto me it seems silly that you have these \"rats\" or factions that are only seen in belts most of the time and in their own facilities that you see with missions. why dont they ever try to make a run on the stations of systems they hunt in?you can make it so that is escalates as well. and maybe once a month you can get it where the rats are attacking the station and fail, and declare they have back up coming, and waves of them come in and at the end you might get a faction item from the leader or maybe a low scale officer module. but i guess the officer modules would have to be for if they ever wanted to implement this with outposts in 0.0 , and seeing as there is no way destroy an outpost, i dont see why not. i would like to hear your comments"
"warning a large amount of text is about to follow. the devs asked for a detailed alternative to the current sov mechanics. here one is.current issueslack of a decisive battle. sov warfare as implemented can be described as attack pos, reinforce, attack pos, rinse, repeat. instead of one battle a number of small battles happen around each pos in system. if there is a single decisive battle it consists of either attempting to enter the system or attack on the cyno jammer.poses are weak: the current large pos is balanced against a battleship fleet with two or three capships acting as flagships. some of the larger recent cap battles have seen more then 100 capships on each side. indeed many battles are fought around the gate, the defenders trying to keep the attackers out, instead of at a fortified hardpoint (the pos).scenery: current pos mechanics encourage the claiming of space that will not be used (i.e. scenery). a single large pos can be used to claim a system and begin accumulating sov. eventually a scenery system can be linked into a jumpbridge network and/or cynojammed to degrade enemy logistics.modification:military pos: each level of pos (small, medium, large) currently trumps the sov claims of all poses of a lower level. a military pos will trump the sov claims of all large poses in the system. a system can have one and only one military pos at a time, a military pos can only be deployed in player claimable 0.0.production: sov poses will be available in either bpc or manufactured form from each empire faction navies lp store. costs will be equal to purchase of a faction battleship or faction battleship bpc. each system that currently has an outpost or conquerable station, and uncontested sov, will have one large sov claiming pos transformed into a military pos.stats: a military pos will have 10x the hps of the current equivalent best pirate faction pos. modules will be bonused to have 3x the ehp (per resists), all guns and missiles equipped to a military pos will do an additional 10x damage (base * current pos bonus * 10) and have an extra 50% range. unlike a civilian pos, cpu using modules will not go offline when a military pos goes into reinforced.a military pos will have the same grid as the current best pirate faction pos of its type. it will have <U+FFFD> the current best named cpu (to prevent ewar star poses). fuel and stront bays will be 7x the size of current large pirate faction bays and consume 7x the fuel of their respective large counterparts. neither a cynojammer nor a pos jumpbridge may be onlined at a military pos.reinforcement: unlike a civilian pos a military pos will come out of reinforced only at certain times, selectable by the defenders. these will correspond roughly to 8 p.m. moscow, central european, gmt, us est, us pst and oceanic. a thirty minute variation will be introduced based on the dominate rat type of the region to help distribute server loads. this allows an attacker to hit multiple points with some assurance that more then one will come out of reinforced at the same time.intermediate objectivesa new concept will be introduced of occupancy points. occupancy is determined by adding computing the daily system use index this consists of: (all rat bounties collected in system) + (bonus for each plex completed) + (npc price value of all minerals/gas [but not moon materials] mined). (daily use index) + (value of all good items sold at outpost market in system) is compared to the average daily use index for all systems of a similar truesec rating (note this average daily used does not include market sales). systems in the top <U+FFFD> gain 5 occupancy points, systems in the middle <U+FFFD> gain 1 occupancy point. every 3 large poses flown in a system by the sov claiming alliance generated 1 additional occupancy point. los of sov zeros out all occupancy points."
"command centerssystem command centers arise for every 5 stepped occupancy points:example: level 1 = 1 * 5 (5 occupancy points), level 2 = 2 * 5 + 1 * 5 (15 occupancy points), level 3 = 3 * 5 + 2 * 5 + 1 * 5 (30 occupancy points). each new level resets the counter to 0. loosing a level resets the counter to zero. each command center shows up on overview (similar to fw plexes) and has some minimal defenses. there is a limit of 10 command centers in any one systema command center gives any military pos in the system a 2% across the board bonus to resists, damage and range.when a command center is disabled it goes offline (the military pos looses its bonus). all other command centers in the system go into reinforced and can not be damaged for a period of one hour. when a command center is repped, it must then be onlined. only one command center can be onlined per hour."
"why are you trying to combine battles and focus them into one, even bigger, blob? the servers can't handle that."
"my suggestion is this: sov is determined by number of ship-tonnage-hours in system.that is, rather than depending on having structures erected, sov is simply maintained by having people flying ships in a system. the more ships (and the bigger the ships) that people are flying in a system, the more that alliance \"owns\" the system.sov bonuses will then be a metagame statistic that reflects the level of presence that an alliance can muster to control a system. i guess a \"story\" to explain it is that sov would simulate the patrols that are being done by hirelings of a system. whatever.pos warfare encourages blobs. many smaller roaming fleets would encourage folks to spread out more. sov gains could be tuned to favour smaller gangs that move about (eg: on a logarithmic factor for number of number of ships, linear factor for tonnage, exponential factor for number of warps within system, exponential factor for number of jumps into the system)but what benefit does sovereignty actually provide? simply the right to erect pos in system? some kind of bonus to combat in system? perhaps high enough sov will invoke npc reinforcements any time a fight breaks out?"
"because i'd rather have a battle once (when the server can be reinforced) then 10-15 battles spread out over a weeks time when the servers are the luck of the draw. besides you're going to see the same numbers for \"one big battle\" and \"first big push\" it's just the weeks of laggy pain that come after that we're taking care of."
"all real life references and subsequent posts have been removed.the candidate threads are designed to set questions to candidates about in-game issues. any comments regarding real life issues will be removed and the poster warned."
"so hey! who wants to discuss spaceships?"
"sounds good. i support your candidature as well."
"i endorse scagga's candidacy"
"lord scagga is the most worthy csm candidate to advance eve. if you want a dependable, deep thinking person who is knowledgeable about improving the fun, gut wrenching, soul-tearing, fanatically obsessive part of eve, then look no further. my vote goes to him, and i know this is also true for those who know him in person and in character."
"the main issue is it allows you to do things like deal with farmers/macro miners/courier mission runners. seeing the same set of 20 characters running courier missions or mining for over 20 hours a day and not having a mechanism to deal with it is no fun. you can petition them, but as many of us know ccp does not always act. you can possibly limit the war dec to a few weeks or other methods to limit abuse."
"it's unreasonable to expect that every csm will be experts and advocates for every part of eve society and it's quite unnecessary seeing as how there will undoubtedly be empire and low sec types on the board as well. vuk lau has my votes. he sounds to me like a man who would work hard to improve the 0.0 game and make it more accessible for all players."
"great person for the work to tackle eve issues that matter to all of us on daily basis.he has displayed great character and understanding in dealing on alliance and player levels, to get the required results for all parties involved.my full support."
"i don't disagree with the fact that some less legit aspects of the game use npc corps, but that does not mean that there isn't a vast part of legitimate npc corp players. perhaps you should look at the npc corp chat channels, aliastra's channel is very much alive with people offering advice and talking about their accomplishments. so are the other npc corps i've seen.even if the wardec would last a week, what do you expect legitimate solo players to do about a 100 man grief corp camping their undock ramp? you might as well ban them from the game, as there's no way they can play.i find it unacceptable that anyone would cause so much collateral which such a short-sighted mechanic. it displays sheer ignorance of certain aspects of eve. what i'd rather see was an issue which called for a stricter and quicker dealing with macro-ers, as the masses of innocent people should not suffer because of a few mosquitos which someone tries to kill with a cannon."
"i do believe we have got waay to much csm members who are more worried about polishing empire aspects of eve then addressing major issues which trouble 0.0 alliances and warfare here.i consider myself as 0.0 veteran and i am sure vast majority of pilots which are living in this part of eve would find vuk<U+FFFD>s ideas more then interesting and worthwhile of their voice.eve is more then one big empire mission doing game."
"you've already got my vote (well, not really, but you know what i mean all the same) ... good luck, though with your record i doubt you've any great need of it!"
"first off, anyone who pays the second ransom is a fool and deserves what they get. for that matter, anyone who pays the first ransom without at least doing an eve search check of c+p for their corp name to see if they're dishonorable ransomers probably deserves what they get too. i've fought aggressive wardecs, but i've never broken a ransom doing it. for that matter, unless my experience with said wardecs is very different from anyone else's, the idea that they're usually resolved by a griefer getting a ransom is totally wrong. most of the wardecs my corp was involved with ended in the target paying a merc corp 5x as much as we were asking, and the mercs and us fighting to basically a standstill - we held our own, but we didn't usually manage to put them up against the wall hard enough to get money out at the end of it. people have an unnatural hatred for paying off pirates. anyways, unrelated nostalgia/ranting aside, i will agree that wardecs are a badly implemented system, and they need a lot of work. the problem with any such system is that wars are all different - some are for ransom, some are wars of mutual consent, some are harassment, and some are other things entirely. in order for a wardec system to not be counterproductive, it has to accommodate all of this. there should probably be the option of turning a wardec into something much like a freeform contract - putting explicit terms down on paper, though probably without the game enforcing them. you can still do a blank one if you like, but it'd at least streamline the process, and maybe make it generally more functional if they had some good pre-set options in there. if you don't mind a public record of wars, you could even incorporate a feedback system, so there's a record of ransom violators aside from a forum search. i think that's going too far, but it's an option. if you prefer to go the route of having the game enforce these contracts, one thing you can do is include a \"no redeccing for x days\" provision in the settlement. i think that one would address a lot of the problems you mention, and it'd see a lot of use. one thing in particular i don't want to see is the game setting victory/defeat conditions on player wars. just because you're down 3:1 in kills after a week doesn't mean you think you've lost, and i'm not willing to have the game force a loss on you when you want to fight to the end. some wardeccers will find that tactic annoying - after all, that's the whole point of it - but it is legitimate. sorry if this seems a bit disjointed, but that's basically my thoughts on the topic of wardecs, for now at least."
"you just got my vote...and i think i can vouch for my corp.thanks for your response."
"thanks!"
"i'm planning to vote elsewhere this time - last time i think i got drunk first, and then flipped a coin for you or serenity steele (?) and now forget who won the toss - but i'd like to see you get your chance to act in a more official capacity for the csm.i bid you good luck (especially to a fellow aussie!)"
"edit: longing in killed what i saidwhen are ingame events a bad thing?theirs nothing wrong with making the game more lively"
"i look forward to what you have to say on this. i make no secret of the fact that i got into eve precisely because there's a lot of flying ships!"
"and as promised, i have a new blog post. check it out -- this one is filled with various things i'd work on as a csm (and that i hope to work on even if not a csm, though i believe i will be more effect working on them as a csm).i'd post it here, too, but has more characters than are allowed in a single post -- and as i mention in the post, that's one thing i'd like to change (not my verbosity [that's a topic for a different discussion], the character limit for posts).actually, i'll probably post parts of it here tomorrow in order to allow for easier discussion, even if i have to engage in the time honored tradition of saying (continued) at the bottom of my post."
"i just remembered you took part in the malkalen relief.that's more points for you!"
"ha, thanks -- good deeds pay off, it seems!that was a fun time, and a good example of a player run event -- it was good as it was, but i wonder if it could have been improved with some event running tools . . . i seem to recall one or two news articles mentioning it, and that one of the main organizers got interviewed (i think), but it would have been cool to see our actions there be noticed a little more by ccp and have a slight effect upon the storyline."
"i dont see myself having to sacrifice relationships in the way you think viper. i dont see myself saying \"we can't be friends anymore\" based on actions i take as a csm. mind you i may be forced to make a decsision for the greater good, and should that time come, if i think it truly is \"for the greater good of the players\" thats what i will vote with. i really don't think doing so will sacrifice any relationships although i might take flak for it.however if i campaign on an issue, i'm bound to try and make progress on it. things like the nano-nerf were in favor by much of the community, but that does not mean it was the right decision."
"nice one mate, good move on running for this i cannot think of another person best suited for the role.you have a great understanding of the problems faced by both empire, lowsec and 0.0 dwellers so you've got my vote"
"i fully support sophie daigneau.there are quite a few issues in science/industry/market that need to be address and i believe sophie daigneau will hit these issues.while sophie may be 'wealthly' now, he over came the challenges and logistic nightmares that held majority of us back,while sophie kinda mention it, but mining system needs to be address and if anyone knows what's wrong with economical issues in eve it would be sophie. +12 votes.plus i also fly the ships of the internet as a girl."
"sophie has done more to build goonswarm's internal 0.0 economy than any other player i'm aware of. he has a knack for recognizing business opportunities and a way of working to get others involved in his money making schemes as well as supporting our growing ecosystem of independent industrialists. as such, i suspect that he's a great candidate for industrialists everywhere, but especially those that are interested in developing out-of-empire economies."
"having worked with sophie on a number of items though oftentimes via intermediaries i can say that it has a special flair for all things industrial. it has done some simply amazing things when it comes to administration, organization and management of industrial pursuits.any of you looking for an industrial advocate should take a serious look at sophie."
"[list=i]in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?i think that there needs to be greater variety in income. perhaps something unique to 0.0, but also some parity in how it's obtained. as it stands today conquerable 0.0 has mining and ratting. moon mining is typically used to fund the conquering of space, and the individual player has fewer opportunities. ratting is concentrated on a few good systems and mining is often neglected due to the poor rate of return and the amount of effort required.i personally feel that the space currently requiring the most effort to hold should be the most profitable. as it stands today the risk vs. reward equation is completely skewed. there's little to no reason for an empire dweller to come to 0.0 as they're making plenty where they are. i think that the right approach is a carrot and stick methodology. increase the value and you'll increase interest. conquerable 0.0 as it stands today is simply not worth the risk for virtually any starting alliances, thus the low adoption rate.how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?my gut impression is that 0.0 logistics were made difficult as an artificial barrier to allowing small groups of people to conquer large swaths of space. this has not proven to be the case. the biggest impediment to people in conquerable 0.0 today is boredom, as both the enemies and the mechanics have stagnated completely. it's the same dudes fighting the same dudes over the same space. rinse. repeat. oh yay we're going to shoot a pos for 5 hours tonight let's go!essentially the game's boring right now. logistics need to be streamlined and moved away from something resembling self beatings. alliances need to be given more options in managing and improving their space. station upgrades were a good start, but way too expensive with little to no impact on profitability. perhaps some upgrades involving mission agents in space you hold sov over would be a workaround and help balance the profitability between conq. 0.0 and known-to-be-broken npc 0.0. we need to transition away from pos's without turning it into factional warfare. it's a difficult task and one i don't have a personal vision for yet, but i'd like to help think through the concerns. that's part of what the roundtable at fanfest is meant to achieve.what improvements would you like to see in 0.0 as an endgame, things to reward players for having \"made it.\"i think i touched on this already, but allowing sovreigns greater control over their space is desirable. greater control over profitability and traffic. perhaps some greater control over layout. it all has to do with creating a reason to take space other than it being self-fulfilling.how would you raise the status of 0.0 in a productive way to enrich the game?0.0 is without a doubt the concept that i believe attracts most people to the game. it's the gigantic 0.0 wars that get free press. it's the idea of carving out your own slice of space that is the sexiest selling point. right now that needs to start to once again reflect reality. as it stands today 0.0 is dead and is the most least-visited or spoken about aspect of the game by developers. and we wonder why it's also the most boring. neglect is a terrible thingchanges to any capitals or sub-caps in context of healthier 0.0?i think that a lot of people complain about capitals. i do think there should be some investigation into the cause of their proliferation. i mean of course it's the biggest ship and everyone wants to fly the biggest ship, but the simple fact is that the game can't handle large capital engagements and they're typically boring affairs. in crippling lag fighters from carriers and ms's provide an unrealistic advantage as they're not affected. entire fleets which may take ages to assemble are killed with one button click by a dd. this is bad"

"so i missed two actual scheduled meetings in 6 months. quite the flare for the dramatic you've got there accentuating the negative, but your data mining shows exactly what i said in the first place so i'm not quite sure what your point is in addressing me directly. i guess it's just easy to throw stones from the sidelines? as far as your statement regarding people altering their schedules... well it's simply not going to happen. it's a completely unrealistic statement and while you may be the paragon of internet spaceship responsibility i can assure you, nobody else is going to go hungry, or miss a christening or the birth of their child in order to avoid offending your internet sensibilities."
"ccp diagoras has posted the results of the second csm submission to ccp for this term, and so we finally have responses on these topics. i haven't seen much discussion on this list, which i find rather surprising, so i figured i'd start some. talk about whatever you want, but here's a few questions to start debate:everyone: what do you think of the responses - are there any you're excited or disappointed to see? which do you think is a higher priority - bounty hunter/merc improvements, or sovereignty changes(or other game changes of similar weight)? what do you have to say about the questions raised by the review of missions? candidates: are any of ccp's responses going to cause you to change any elements of your platform? are there any topics where you'd press ccp for a more complete or more satisfactory response? do you think these responses change what sort of topics the csm should advance in future?"
"i'd like to see more communication with specific developers. ccp should assign a dev to an issue, so that afterwards the csm that owns the issue can get in touch with feedback or ask for a status update. now i get the feeling that some issues like the gametime codes are just being ignored, and we don't have the means to go after it. likewise i'd like to see much more interaction for industry affairs, we got an expansion coming up, so why not use the csm to gather player intererst and organize discussions? i think we should have something akin to live dev blogs with csm people, but instead that they can ask questions directly.i'm not too happy with the answers given to us. there was more discussion than you can see in the minutes, but it was still too shallow to my tastes."
"i am still open for questions that anyone might have. please feel free to post here.-kaiden"
"first a little bit about me. i am 45, single, and have played various online type games for close to 20 years. (feel free to insert jokes about being single and a gamer here) i currently live in glendale arizona and work for a large corporation in internal technical support. way back in the late eighties i got into computers and gaming online. back then it was calling up bbss and turn based games. i even ran a successful bbs here in arizona called quantum leap bbs for about 5 years. soon after the internet started opening up to the public i started playing muds via telnet. back then you traveled the internet via programs like pine, elm, telnet and gopher. there were maybe a few hundred web pages out at that time. i ended up playing a mud called ragnarok for a few years and played it up until 1999 when a new game came out called everquest. i ended up playing eq for close to 7 years. during that time i helped beta test several of the expansions for eq as well. during that time i also beta tested planetside along with its first expansion. about two years ago i beta tested and continued to play vanguard. roughly 6 months ago i was setting up a lynx box and ran across the game we all love called eve. i currently run two accounts on eve. the main account is quantum light, and is run as a pve, manufacturing, and exploration. my second account is a miner called quantum light1 (duh). i also have a few other characters for hauling and hunting macro miners. for now, i am not into pvp, but who knows down the road that could change. coming over from the world of everquest and other sony based games has given me a bit of a different point of view coming into the world of eve. first i still tend to cringe every time i do a mission for soe. the biggest thing to surprise me is how cold blooded and ruthless it gets on the forums. eve players have made an art form out of trolling. my guess is it has a lot to due with eve being a pvp based game. most of the time it can be quite entertaining, but it does tend to bury some very good ideas under a lot of bull. this is probably one of the main reasons i decided to run for csm. i am the type of person that prefers to sit back and listen to the entire ranting, strip off the emotion and make a decision based on the facts and logic. a point in case it i remember a poster something to the effect that he/she wanted, no demanded that this change be put in and that ccp put it in today or he would quit the game! needless to say a good portion of the people wished him good bye and a good time playing wow. i can also guarantee you no matter how good his idea was, ccp was not even look at it due to the way he presented it. first, any idea presented to ccp for consideration must be well though out, and worded with minimal emotion. ccp is a company, and eve is the product that they produce. and as a company they need to look at any change put to them and see how it affects the company and the game. i am not trying to side up with or suck up to ccp but trying to bring to a point the following. any idea that is presented to ccp, you need to strip any emotions from it and present to them just the well thought out facts. demanding, bullying, whining, etc will only tent to get them to close their ears and eyes to what may be a really good idea."
"as for wanting an idea implemented right now or today, sorry but i will not back it. there are most likely more than a million of lines of code in eve, and you want to change/add code into it within a few days? that could make the boot.ini fiasco pale in comparison. i have seen in my own job what happens when someone put in just a little code change without testing or checking with other areas. the 3 lines of code brought down the entire mainframe for 3 hours right at deadline.what i hope to bring is a calm logical voice to the csm that can take the ideas put fourth in a very raw form on the forums and other areas, and then turn them into a well thought out form that ccp would put serious thought to. this includes ideas for all parts of the game, including pvp, alliance, mining, exploration, pve, trading, and manufacturing, as they are all needed for eve to succeed."
"bump"
"maybe they'll be fixed by this time next year :unsmith:"
"boost the nag"
"wait, you mean ccp are taking another csm-sponsored issue and lumping it into another 'maybe we'll look at it later' pile? shocking!"
"sup"
"i agree 100% and would even give this high priority.the decision to abandon events that involve the players was the single worst one ccp ever took."
"/support"
"*supported*my best experience was escorting the speaker of truth (several events). those events are still high on the list of reasons i love eve."

"i managed to get involved, in only a minor way, with the \"brothers of freedom\" plotline while i was part of strix. it was great fun to think that you were actually able to have an effect on the outcome of the story, albeit that the plotline kind of petered out somewhat at the end ...anyway i definitely agree that these kind of events definitely help to make the eve universe the great place to be that it is. however i would not suggest providing any sort of material gain from these events - simply taking part should be incentive enough, and material gain may in fact promote the wrong kind of behaviour at such events."
"getting live events back would be huge for the roleplaying community, and for the game in general. make it happen!"
"^^^"

"against the nano nerf in the current form, as it severely limits the possibilities of 1 vs multi pvp in a blaster-bs. with improved tracking on blasterobats and/or not as severaly nerfed webbers i might be in favor of some of these changes.cheers, xeno"

"against"
"as specialist in minmatar ships this will devastate my charcter,wasting years of skill training i`m most definatley against the nano nerf.. go fix the lag instead minmatar have already been nerfed to hell leave us alone!!!!"
"i have to agree - it would be interesting to have the downtime cycling but as others have also pointed out, it not likely to be received to well by ccp - specifically the person that would have to restart the servers at 3:00am their time.thanks for the view points and opinions!"
"a cycling downtime would be a horrible idea. you'd never really know when it would be off next time, unless you played every day. it would also seriously frell up ccp's server tech support schedule. those responsible for immediate startup server issues would really hate you for cycling shifts."
"with all due respect... did you forget that there are time zones around the planet?ccp won't do it.. its likely they picked that time because its the least amount of traffic load.and its conveniently timed during non-business hours for an atypical office."
"im fine with the dt and 22 gmt is way to late because everybody is at home and need their eve fix"
"i believe its evident to all the thinking eve players that ccp have been lacking in making blockade runners completly invulnerable.yes, with the new addition of the cov ops cloak and the ability to warp cloaked, it will be impossible to kill them in low sec, and difficult to kill them in 0.0.but there are still occasions where they might be caught. perhaps a one in a million collision with a space pea in lowsec uncloaking it before it insta warps.its called a blockade runner stupids! its supposed to run the blockades not die to them. or else it would be called a blockade dieship or something. as such i would like to propose blockade runners be boosted with a mini dock wormhole device. the idea is this:player is docked in jita.player buys cargo.player select pull down menu and chooses system and station he wishes to go to.player instantly is transported to said stationplayer sells cargo for profitjust call it jovian something or other and people will accept the techskunk"
"someone give me marshmellows. i have the graham crackers and chocolate.campfire is about to start."
"first page on another stupid topic.ccp did a good thing on the br if you ever saw pirates whining then here it is."
"does it say low sec pirate under my name?i think notim a low sec liberator, and i would remind you of this distinction every time you post.also you forgot to tick supportskunk"
"lets say this is done, what's makes your cargo worth more now? anyone can now negate the risk of traviling to buy stuff, so the value of your cargo has been lowered, and now your only selling to the lazy that don't want to travel to jita."
"since it pretty much is just bots and pirates in low sec. if you pirate the pirates... you kind of are a pirate.ya blockade runners are pretty much immune to being caught as it is. they then gave pirates hictors... which still rarely caught blockade runners.oh and le skunk...when you have -10 sec status. you are a pirate; by definition."
"im only -9.999 true sec statusskunk"
"actually he's an outlaw by definition, not a pirate"
"that's the stupidest idea i've ever heard...i mean while i think they need to be buffed... but to give them such an ability is insane.you wan't to help blockade runners? how about giving them more low slots and +2 war stab bonus for every ship under \"transport ship\" class.that or boosting cargo space.now your talking.you'll need an interdictor to stop those suckers.... and that means anyone serious about nailing those suckers would have to be serious with cash and effort.that.. makes sense... not some damned harebrained idea of a \"wormhole\"talk bout messing up balance.ps: i happen to fly blockade runners.... they need a bit more love... not \"godmode\"/me thumbs down"
"its called a blockade runner stupids. not a blocakade dieer.what sense does it make to call this ship a blockade runner if its goging to die on the blockade.skunk"
"actualy maybe ccp shoulda equipped a pirate whine fail bomb launcher."
"it's called a blockade runner because its designed to bust bloackades... not become freaking impossible to stop/catch/shoot/invunerable.might as well call the damn thing a concord frigate/cruiser or something at that rate."
"dont be silly. its designed by ccp to be invulnerable in low sec - hene the addition of the cov ops cloak usage.skunk"
"if i wantted to be silly i'd call you pepe la pew.ccp didn't design the blockade runner to be invulnerable... they designed it to have a higher \"chance\" of surviving a gatecamp and breaking through blockades.and in case you didn't know this... they call them... transport ships.so obviously calling them a blockade runner is a bit of a misnomer.now if they are granting covert ops cloak... well i'd say that about makes it drastically harder to nail them... don't you?why make it any more insane?i mean..... sheesh i can't believe im taking the side of a pirate here."
"nice troll post btw, even if i don't agree with you"
"why is it called a blockade runner if your idea will never have it going near blockades?"
"lol i want some marshmellows too"
"ok ok... you have me there.... but transport ships and blockade runners are 2 literal things.but yes... i concede... your right."
"i agree. there are already four major conglomerates (aka coalitions, nations, etc), and this would give them an easy interface to control everything. there are also a few lone wolf alliances, but those are rare.for instance, we have the greater bob community, the northern coalition (iron, mostly harmless, razor, etc), the southern coalition (goon, red, iac, etc), and the providence coalition (cva, et al). this would allow them to set naps and control rights for outposts automatically, giving a greater sense of community in the game."
"supporting the idea, i think it could use a lot of thinking over and refinement, though. i'd like to see this as possibly something that individual corps can be members of, not just alliances, and that is not just for big groups in 0.0, but for small coalitions in lowsec as well."
"i'll support this in that's it's an idea worth investigating, though i'd want to hear more about specifics before supporting it being implemented, of course!"
"additional thought: perhaps if this were implemented in some form, fw could work like coalitions -- so some alliances could join, but big 0.0 powers that wanted to form their own coalitions could not. just a thought!"
"i've never wantted to join an allaince due to the obvious poltical overtones that would be forced on the member corps so to speak.but a this.... this allows formal \"pacts\" between alliances so they can maintain a bit of independence... but support each other none-the-less./me forgot to hit support"
"i'm sure this has been gone over before but i have not seen or could find a motion made or submitted to the csm members. what i have noticed is that the drone regions keeping the market over saturated with morphite. this dose 2 things that i can see are undeniable.discourages miners from mining morphite because there are minerals to mine that will pay more on the hour.also it drives the cost of t2 products down which in turn drives the rest of all the t2 components and advanced minerals down due to the end sale value of the product in which the producer is going the want to make a profit and pass the loss down to line.i believe that if morphite based alloys were removed from drone npc ship loot tables then it would case a positive impact on the current t2 market."
"removing minerals from loot would in general be quite good, imo"
"high sec lvl 4 missions generate morphite and large quantities of zydrine and megacyte because of drones. essentially hurting the profit of 0.0"
"call me confused: how does decreasing the cost to build a t2 item (through lower-priced materials required for construction) create for the t2 builder a loss that he pass on to the consumer in the form of higher prices? the opposite is true: decreasing the supply of morphite as you suggest will drive the cost of morphite up, and with it the cost of all items that require morphite to construct.that having been said, you still might be right about morphite being too easy to get through ratting in the drone regions. it might be, for example, that the ratio of morphite alloys to other allows is too high. some data-mining ought to be useful, here, and some things they could look at include:a) is the value worth of drone droppings reasonable compared to the loot and bounty of similar non-drone rats?b) does the mineral distribution of the drone droppings favor morphite too much?c) does the 'compactness' of the drone droppings compared to conventional loot plus bounties make it possible to profit more from drones than other npc rats?if inbalances are found, they could:a) change the total amounts of drone droppings per killb) change the ratio of morphite droppings to non-morphite droppings (while keeping the value constant)c) change the size of rat droppings"
"oh, i disagree that droppings should be removed entirely, though: drone droppings are actually better in some ways than bounties, since they do not represent an influx of isk into the game, like bounties do. they give valuable property to the ratter, which can be sold; but isk is not 'created', it is transferred from other players."
"would that include drone metals, where minerals are the only thing you get for killing them?"
"definitely! they've been awesome so far"

"what i don't understand, is that we are on a forum, and the advantages of a forum are there are many tools to audit and listen to the suscribed people, like rating for the thread and polls thread.let's say i'm selling a program and i'm about to make deep changes in the way it's used. shouldn't i ask my usersbase if the changes i'm trying to implement are not gonna put them in troubles ? ( especially when those same users are paying 2 or 3 times the license to use it because of their multiple accounts )now let's say we are in the future in 2014, everything is done server/client side. ccp programmers/3d graphists are respectively using microsoft visual studio 16 and autodesk maya 2014, each morning they launch their client to use maya or visual. suddendly autodesk say hey : we are gonna change maya architecture, now you will need to do your modelling with metaballs ! hope we don't put the crap in everything you have done for years ? you are not happy aren't you ? ( since the software is working online ccp don't have the choice and is fu**ed ). i guess they would not be happy themselves...so it would be nice if ccp developpers:- play their game.- play it well ( not doing crappy pew pew on sisi, that does'nt count and isn't representative of tq ).- respect their customers that give them a lot of money every months to get fun.- listen their customers.- talk with them whenever you are doing deep changes that compromise a lot of stuff.it's the minimal to do, but that's get really rare these days.now i'm waiting for the blaster poll, don't tell us it's impossible to put this mechanism on track, every forum on internet as it."

"i just went back to look at an older thread from events, and it was gone. did they only move the last week or two of threads? that's just disgusting."
"as far as i can tell they've only moved those threads where the op knew about/bothered to petition ccp to do so (there might be a few exceptions - impossible to tell).5 years of big lottery threads down the tube...i'm pretty gutted about that tbh...particularly sad with regards to the anniversary round threads...and as said above - the \"mood\" of both channels are completly destroyed."
"i see what you meant by that, yeah - i didn't realize they'd deleted, i assumed they'd just merged the boards like any sane person would have done. my lottery thread was moved without a request, but it was for an active lottery, they probably knew it was rather important. as for your threads, i know the big site is still there, and so is eve search, but the loss of those threads is just a waste. it's one of the classic institutions of this game, it should get better treatment than that. deleting forum data is something that should never be done unless there's a very good reason, and this is exactly why."
"in all honesty flying a capital ship is something that should always require some teamwork, and i think thats what ccp have been trying to do with how cynos are now.having cyno gens in low sec would make things much to easy"

"i understand that some people feel that capital ships should need some forum of team work to work properly. the main point i'm trying to get across is that some times you are in the wrong time zone, and there is no way for some one to help you in the corp or alliance you are in. take the prime time for eve, the uk. theirs plenty of people around during that time but for us time zone players some alliances just go dead and can't get any one to help, so you stuck doing one of 2 things.sitting there,begging for help when there is none, getting nothing done, whats the point.-or-training 2 cyno alts on a second account.and like i said before, i do not believe this game should be alt inflamed as it is. so, in response to the sarcasm in dianeces post, you have not addressed ether of my main ideas in a positive or negative way. so please refrain from saying anything at all next time unless you have something real to add."
"i agree that having auto-pilot default to 0km is not a good idea, but there is some room for improvement i think to make afk traveling a little easier.for example, adding an option to the fittings on your ship to default \"on\" after a warp. you could set your afterburners, boosters and hardeners to turn on automatically then after each exit out of warp ... have you ever been in a battle and realized half-way through that you forgot to turn something on?"
"this, or even better (cause it's not so overpowered) autopilot to be able to use mwd/ab.like it's now it's just ridiculous... we are in a high tech future, we should have some features."
"the main wtz ap thread in features and ideas. be aware that many arguments have been posted there and shot down. try not to repeat them.and why is choosing between bordem or increased travel time a good idea ? so how does roleplaying deal with afk ? ah yes. the human pilot is somehow much more accurate than the computer built specifically for navigation when you need accuracy on the order of tiny fractions of a second.even when computers in real life generally are much more accurate than humans when all the rules are known. especially when it comes to doing something within a tiny fraction of a second of when you want it to happen.if you want to see how small a fraction, go calculate how long your ship takes to travel 15km when your going at your max warp velocity. because that is how well you need to time the start of the declaration. so most gatecamps today are incapable of catching anyone who isn't using the current autopilot ? but if you don't align quick enough, the wtz autopilot will screw you over even when manual flight will get you out. and even if you are at the controls, it will decloak you before you decide what the best action is.yes. back to the speed/bordem tradeoff.if you guys come up with an argument that i haven't seen in the main wtz ap thread, please post it there since i won't be watching this thread."
"if we were to have an individual window for every character docked in station i would agree - this would tax the system too much. but how about one window, that everyone could look out. something as simple as a default (that is, nothing customizable as the regular overview, but something very basic). thoughts?"

"wow can i just say hi pot....if anyone is a liar it's you oodin, not to get off topic, but man i was in few fw fleets with you where you started firing at fleet members... and if fw was a real alliance your ass would have been kicked out just for that..the problem here is fw doesn't have a human figure head, so there are no judements, and i feel this has been over looked. fw needs to have some control for your type of crap chicken **** actions.and now i wish in the game ingor worked in the forum too"
"i never said i didnt shoot militia members. all i said was i claimed killrights given to me and if you have any clue whatsoever about the game you would know that to get killrights a crime must have be commited against me first..you understand that i hope...karma sucks"
"that's exatly my point there oodin, you picked the wrong time to collect on kill rigths. in a human alliance this type of action would have lead to you being kicked and possible your entire corp being kicked. tell me this if you had been in a human lead alliance, and you were out on an op with the alliance would have taken your kill rights then?your no better then a corp that war dec and waits for a fw fleet to come by. you hide your intent behind the fw and in every fleet that i was in with you, the fleet disbanded as the entire op was ruined by your actions. how is that any pvp fun for the group?"
"i made a entire fleet disband i must be better then i tought besides the killrights was given to me when i was in militia so they stepped over the line first"
"lolyou obviously dont remember the start of fw where 10 forum posts a day were started by fw noob proclaiming we are smashing the pirates hahaha we are uber.pirates left the area in droves due to the fw lag blobs flying around.now the whines back to \"pirates are bullying noobs\"not supporting this thread of any other that seeks preferential treatment to one corp over anotherskunk"
"in principle, i don't believe that being in the same militia should immunise your corporation against suffering the consequences of its behaviour towards other militia members. i could see where you're coming from on this one, but i don't think this is the right way to solve the problem. rather, i would suggest you consider this: shouldn't these corporations be so enamoured by fw activities that dec'ing each other becomes unthinkable by their own volition, rather than an imposition by game mechanics?skaxx, i would bring to your attention that many of those same corporations would love the extra targets that this proposition would incur. this would be a one-way ticket to more wardecs against fw corps, imo.if i have understood you correctly, treating the wardec as if it is against an alliance means that random fw pilots will suffer the consequences of other people's misdeeds, who may decide to use the militia as their 'haven'.the enemy of my friend is my enemy logic is best avoided. imagine how this would interact with the proposal #1, where if there was a corp in a militia hiding in militia high sec...if the militias are not to be so selective about who they let join, the perks would not be matching.i think this one followed on from #3skaxx, fw has plenty of room for improvement but i think the approach needs more consideration. i've mentioned alternate approaches in my campaign thread that i'd be happy to discuss."
"maybe you should re-read the entire thread, as clearly that is not the idea here. the only preferential treatment being given is for corps that war dec corps in fw, and then wait for the easy picking of the one in the many fleet and kill it."
"3. in any of the militia high sec if you are an opposing faction you deal with both that militia and the militia npcs. if a corporation decs a militia corporation and they choose to bring the fight into that militias high sec, the npcs should assist said militia against the agressors.3) the op wants both effective barring of 50% of empire and npc harrasement for the non militia corp. this would not happen with non miltia deccing a non militia.basically i would wardec you in empire, and be unable to attack you in empire and do the suppsoed stated aims of a wardec ( disrupt your logistics etc in high sec) as i would be unable to get in there easily without npcs kicking my ass.skunkedit: ive said it many many many times before. the only people who facilitate the \"picking off\" of members or a militia wardecced corps in a wider militia fleet, are the cowards who sit and watch their gang mates die without firing out of fear of a sec drop.i wouldnt have any one in any of my gangs if they were not prepared to fire if gangmates come under attack, regardless of sec drops and sentrys."
"i have taken the sec drop, but most of these events are happening in hi sec now, so the best one can do is hope that they enguage you...."
"now i finally see the extent of your game mechanics understanding...you are clueless so please go back to tutorial ok..."
"i'm not sure that changing the wardec system to prevent two corps in the same militia from being at war is a good solution; i could see it leading to situations where, for example, corp a (in militia) 'legitimately' wardecs corp b (not in the militia) ... and corp b responds by joining the militia to invalidate the wardec.actually, i think that the much-anticipated (at least by some) change to allow alliances in fw may (depending on implementation details) provide a solution to this problem. in addition to allowing existing rp alliances to (re-) join the war, it will also provide the ability for corps already in the militias to form alliances, too. so now like-minded corps who are trying to fight for their faction can merge into an alliance for mutual support from wardecs, increased organization, shared standings, etc. or, if less organization is preferable, you could use the alliance for mutual defense only, and ignore the standings and other tools available."
"edit: i've changed the title to reflect that this is now a discussion, as the proposal below is being reconsideredthe problem:many people i've spoken with have repeatedly mentioned that targets logging out in or around combat times, also dubbed 'logoffski', can be a virtually game-breaking problem for many who pvp. example #1: \"a raven is npc'ing in 0.0. when the pilot sees you in local his aligned ship warps to a safespot, cloaks and/or logs. his ship, which is not aggressed, will disappear in 30 seconds. there is nothing you can do.\"example #2: \"they jumped in - now our gang had theirs cornered. it was going to be a bloody fight till they decided to stay cloaked and log off.\"reviewing the current system:if i am not mistaken, this is the current system:log off cloaked: ship cannot be probedlog off without aggression: ship disappears in 30 secondslog off with aggression: ship disappears when aggression ends(not to forget emergency warps) a solution:a proposed solution i now present to you: 'flatlining'flatlining is a term i'm using to describe shutting down all a ship's systems except those involved in crew life support systems (including warp drive). this causes the signature radius of a ship to drop markedly, but also makes it unable to 'do' anything.remember the current mechanics i mentioned?this is what i propose to have changed in current mechanics:log off cloaked (non-cov ops): cloak deactivateslog off without aggression: ship disappears in 5 minuteslog off with aggression: ship disappears when aggression endshold on, that's not balanced - yet!now, add the 'flatliner' setting to this mix:if you log off with all systems shut down, the ship disappears at the same time as mentioned above, but the % chance of probing the ship down drops very significantly. the ship, however, cannot warp out if caught due to having inactivated its warp drive to avoid detection.there is a drawback, however: when you log back in, it takes about 5 minutes to get the systems back to operational status - during which you could be probed again. the warp drive is also deactivated - so if you are found, you can't warp out or defend yourself.so, log off with systems shut down: you can be caught, but it is more difficult. if you are caught - you can't run. if you log back in, it will take time to switch the systems back on and go back to what you were doing: e.g. pvp/npc'ing...etc. would it be used? with the change proposed to cloaking mechanics - i think people will prefer this system to cloaking if logging out in hostile spacebenefits:- for the hunter: with the extension of the time a ship can be found to 5 minutes if not aggressed, hunters have a realistic chance of catching their prey- for the prey: with the flatliner settings the prey have a way to defend themselves if they have to log out, but can remain logged in and cloaked if they can stay to play the game"
"supporting my own idea as such.one point: please make suggestions if you see ways this proposal can be improved, it may have aspects that i have not noticed.edit: removing support while i reapproach the problem through further discussion to work round it"
"sounds interesting in theory, but how will this effect someone who disco's in the same situation (ie, wants to stay but connection drops instead) will they be subject to this 5 min warm up time? unless i'm mistaken, if someone disco'd they would have to put up with this 5 min warm up where they could be probed and defenceless.as far as someone who logoffski that seems fair, but to someone who legitimatly disco'd that seems a bit harsh.correct me if i'm missing something?"
"so what you're saying is that ccp doesn't pander enough to your desires, and should give you free targets to track down and blow up?"
"that is quite a legitimate concern. it is unfortunate, i think, that the result of logging out vs disconnecting does not produce a different result ingame. the situation where i think your observation is most relevant is for disconnecting without aggro - an extra 4.5 minutes to be scanned down. for those who log out in pvp, this would make no different however. to address this concern: one could suggest a small improvement to this i.e. allowing a user to set their ship to 'automatically shut down all systems if i log out/d'c in space' , which would allow them to compensate for an unreliable connection. otherwise, i would be most inclined to hear what other workarounds people can think of. indeed if a practical workaround doesn't seem possible, it'll be back to the drawingboard with this one.actually not miss rinn - you wouldn't be aware, i'm sure, that my current ingame activities are mainly engaged in market trading, so this is hardly my own desires i'm catering to. i'm trying to address problems that are frequently raised about pvp. if you would like to suggest improvements, please come forward!"
"i guess it would be possible for the client to send a command to the server saying that someone has hit ctrl-q or esc/quit game, but it would be too easy to work around when you can just kill the process through task manager or even pull the network cable!unfortunately, this just gives the people (loggers?) the ability to undo what you are trying to achieve with a simple toggle. still pondering this one, i can see why ccp had difficulty dealing with this issue."
"yes, pulling the network cable or other conduits for simulating logging off in combat could confound things - however, making pulling a log off more difficult may help with the issue, perhaps?personally i didn't see it that way - because if the 'logger' logs off and automatically goes into 'flatliner' mode, they can still be scanned down."
"for the determined logger, i think they will just go around it though!personally i didn't see it that way - because if the 'logger' logs off and automatically goes into 'flatliner' mode, they can still be scanned down.ah, i think i misinterpreted you there, unfortunatly for the person who d/c'd they go into flatliner mode when they log back on and will have the 5 min warm up to contend with, where the \"logger\" will just wait out the agressor and hope that they don't get scanned out.(if i'm understanding this part correctly.)"
"how to make 0.0 massive fleet wars really bad.take your idea and mulitply it by 1000 pilots.now shove in about 2000 to 3000 ships in one node.wow... that's staggering to think about.while i see the problem with the logging off... your idea has a great many drawbacks and problems that would really be an issue.it is virtually impossible to tell the difference between logging off and a disconnect when the server is heavily loaded.specially if there's a desynch...if you can't detect such things effectively factoring in latency.... your going no where real quick.the only thing i could suggest is when you log off.... your modules go to idle status and it does what it always does... warps out.but to take it any further than that... would risk some nasty repercussions for those who do drop off line accidently."
"re: determined loggers - yup, no doubt. the intention is to merely make it harder for one to always get away scot free.re: second part - yep that's closer to what i was thinking."
"mr draconis, i agree with your points and they are actually quite convincing. as i mentioned earlier in the thread - if it proved impractical it'd definitely require a return to the drawing board! unfortunately, i did not consider the effects of 1000s of pilots doing this at the same time.i would still like to look into the issue though. while your suggestion of modules going idle and warping out is quite reasonable and quite close to if not precisely in line with current mechanics, i'm sure there could be a way to make it better."
"thank you for the compliment.... quite rare here.you have my respect. o7as for your problem... yes its an exploit to a certain degree... but one that requires timing and quick reflexes.its not something easily fixed... and its never going to be as simple as \"lets do it this way\"all of it is due to the nature of the insanity that is the internet. tcp/ip structure is such that to know the difference between logging off and disconnect would depend entirely on the server that's watching the so called player/node.if they don't have the adequate tech to track.... there's not much to be done.it would require the client... to send information to the server upon reconnect some sort of indication of \"what happened\".which could lead to a number of security implications... but it would allow the petitioning of \"logoffski's\" to be punished so to speak.but that's a very very messy solution.i guess i'm saying this is quite the pickle.... good luck."
"question: does this proposal include getting rid of the emergency warp system? i'm unclear on this point of your proposal.support in principal getting rid of logoffski tactics, need more info on the specific proposal before deciding to support or not.edit: also, your changes mention that 'non-cov ops' ships which log off cloaked would be decloaked. would this mean that cov-ops ships that log off cloaked would stay cloaked? i have noticed, that, when logging off cloaked in my cov-ops, i am not cloaked when i log back in. . . ."
"while i must say i have relegated the idea to a review at present. regarding your question: no, this proposal does not intend to remove the emergency warp.however, if you have shut down your ship i.e. to help avoid detection - you will be unable to warp until the systems are all back online.edit: to include your second question mr avarr regarding the cloaking mechanics: i was under the impression that if you logged off, you'd remain cloaked. if i was mistaken about that i wouldn't propose changing anything in that department!"
"as you're reconsidering the idea, this is purely hypothetical now, but -- would the being unable to warp also apply to the auto-warp back to where you were before the emergency warp? if it does . . . this has some interesting uses. which might be a good feature to add separately, though i haven't actually thought it out, there may be good reasons not to allow blind warps of small distances . . . but it's interesting to think about.actually, now that i think about it, there probably are good reasons. but it's still interesting to think about.edit: to address the second part, until i noticed that i was decloaked upon logging in, my impression was that one would remain cloaked, at least in a cov-ops ship. and i would recommend changing this to ensure that cov-ops ships stay cloaked when logged off -- though it could have been the log on that uncloaked me, i'm not sure."
"emergency warp = logging off like usual and the ship auto warps out to a random location and then vanishes into a unknown dimension?"
"it generally happens when logging off (either normally while in space or due to a disconnect), it can also happen when you lag a lot entering a new system. i'm not certain if it happens if you currently have an aggression timer, though, a war target tried a logoffski on us a few days ago and his ship didn't go anywhere, though his pod warped immediately. as far as i understand, it warps you 1,000,000km directly forward, and then automatically warps you back when you log back in/stop lagging."
"seems to be far too many things wrong with this idea to support it but i was wonderingwould it be to difficult to just make the client communicate with the server when \"log off\", \"quit game\" is pushed?so your in station push quit/log off nothing happens but the sameyour in space you quit/log off and the client tells the server you have done this and the server gives you an agro timer of so long lets say 5 minutes if you discon no communication happens between client and server so server gives normal rule of 30 second timer then disappearthis wouldn't solve the problem entirely but it will sure as hell reduce the number of people using it or would such a feature be to hard to install xailz"

"you cant say no to this sexy.many rogue drones were harmed in the making of that pic."
"still working on a fuller version of the idea, as i see it.two critical things i am realizing more and more that it would need to be an economy helping tool are mechanics of zero sum, and diminishing return.of those the second is vital as it is often not applied so well, if at all, in mmos. diminishing return is often confused for your basic supply and demand mechanics and seems to be ignored when constructing a virtual economy and how resource, manufacturing, and cost to supply is done. my view though is that it is a vital concept to have applied properly. it should cost me more to produce the thousandth item, or procure the thousandth resource then it did the first. and it should be a cost factor completely of the suppliers concern in an idea like i am proposing. as buyers wouldn't factor it into their perception of an item's value, they would just find a supplier who has produced an amount the market will support and has an agreeable price as a result."
"i think this idea has potential also. one other possibile extension ... extend the dynamic of the prices to the number of successful \"asset\" missions offered by agents in the system to players in general? (gives the person owning the asset an interest in seeing other players successfully completing these missions )for example, protecting the miners at a belt of some mineral asset from an npc rat-attack would have an impact on the price/quantity of the assets that players have access too. something very similar to successfully completing a mission now, but with an added effect on the price/quantity of the assets. this shouldn't be the only variable in the asset equation, but i think it would make things more interesting in general ..."

"you need me to spell it out for you? the way i do every agenda is to ensure that each delegate gets one issue in the top nine (in order of the time they request it) if each of the nine delegates asked for an issue by friday they would appear in order in the top nine slots, ie dariusjadelavistaankdierdatuskoinannabaneserenitythen the situation repeats itself for the next nine slots etc etc. in practise the delegates often don't use their slots so i shuffle things forwards. for example, if nobody else puts an issue in this week the final version will look like this:dariusjadelavista(top nine slots issues in order of submission)lavistadarius(next nine slots in order of submission)lavistalavista(next nine slots in order of submission)--- etc. the reason for doing it this way is to ensure that no one delegate can bulk out the agenda with all their own issues (if they wanted too) and that however it works its not a game of issue \"snap\" and each delegate can be sure of getting an item in the top nine as long as they post to the agenda list and provide an issue doc by the friday before the meeting.this is the way its always been done. only change i've made here is to put your issues into the list at the bottom before the reshuffle to make it easier for myself to tidy up on friday. but don't think you are ever going to get a straight run of your issues at the higher end of the agenda unless other delegates opt not to put in an issue in the top nine.so calm down and stop panicking please."
"ah come on. i'm just wondering how come it was formated like that since i hadn't seen it like that before.stop taking offense because i didn't understand what was going on."
"i've known scagga for about 2 years and i endorse his campaign.this is a guy who is committed to eve. i can't think of anyone with more pressing rl needs who still manages to put in the time and thought to this game. like noma has said / implied, scagga isn't scared to think big...but this is a good thing. he also can turn that laser inwards and i can recount convos of him and i (a self confessed gaming min / maxer) arguing extreme minute details of ship fittings. to his credit, he's usually right.most of us can nail down a single or at most a few aspects of the eve universe (combat, trading, construction, exploration, politics, corp management, mining, etc...); scagga is proficient in all of them. he loves to examine the status quo of his current endeavor and then think outside the box to improve upon what is currently \"the best build / tactic.\"it should also be mentioned that he also finds the time to deal with other denizens of the eve universe most of us don't have time for. that's right - the low / no sp nubs. he's that kinda guy.honestly, i don't know how he finds the time. but he does, and the eve universe is a better place for it."
"scagga is an excellent 'ideas man'. despite busy rl commitments, he still keeps thinking about the game. now, i'm not saying all his ideas are good, but the majority of them are ! having scagga in the game certainly improves my eve experience and he will recieve my vote."
"thanks for the support, chaps - it is most appreciated was late for lectures today, so my mind wandered as i listened to music on the bus...then i came up with a possible solution to people logging out in pvp: flatliningedit: some discussions down there have led me to believe this idea needs to go back to the drawingboard as it can be confounded in certain situations...ach such is the fate of ideas of bus origin"
"added proposals on the economy and its markets to post 6."
"following some discussions on matters of fleet warfare, i've added these proposals to the minor improvements:- allow the fc to know the shiptypes of his gangmembers automatically, allowing him to assess the situation more accurately- allow the fc to label that list with 'roles' if necessary(thanks nephilim xeno :))"
"while i support alot of vuk's policies, i also agree with ankhesentapemkah regarding the ability to wardec people in npc corps.i think the amount of griefing would far out weight any gains of being able to target macros."
"hear hear!"
"you bet, macro runners are fully capable to fight back or pay others to do the fighting for them if push comes to shove. so griefers would resort to picking on npc corp loners and noobies. very bad idea."
"using npc corp to be totaly imune in empire needs to be reworked. mission runners are really important for eve economy without any doubt, and game for sure would not look the same without feeling being safe in high sec under npc corp banner but i still believe that there is something which can be implemented to prevent mission runners to mutate to mindless farming bots (which current high sec missions are causing atm). beside customer support and 0.0 issues which are both crying for atention i agree that pve needs huge boost. i still miss aurora events and alongside issues i already mentioned my carebear soul would love to see more roleplaying both in empire and 0.0"
"and no, sir smellyfart is not my alt"
"nice post, even though you did dd me the other day edit: considering my votes to ya"
"vuk is da best ;)knows a lot about game mechanic and likes to play and enjoys the game.and also, he's a nerd willing to devote a large rl portion to this stuff. got my votes."
"i like what you have to say, looks reasonable. you have my vote"
"you seem to be focussing at bots again, but ignore the fact that your suggestion has serious consequences for the legitimate part of the players.i see bots as a problem as well, but i prefer to address them in different ways: by changing the game mechanics to become more dynamic, thus accomplishing both goals: making it harder and perhaps even impossible to script a bot for them, and provide more variation and enjoyment for those that use it as a legit income source."
"if i have a best vote, i think you're getting it. that said, please give my 0.0 question thread a run to add some contrast at the high-end of quality ideas i don't think there's any point in hiding that i think your feel for the game is very compelling."
"this corporate husk and politics sickens me. while you fill me with love and resolve.so i'll be voting for you. but i'll be doing it sickeningly."
"these are some of herschel yamamoto's pvp ship setups. i think they speak for themselves."
"bane my friend this has to be a troll.... there is no way any normal eve player would fit a minmitar ship like this. you see now if i was running for csm i would at least make sure my fits made sense."
"yeah, those fits suck - there's a reason i abandoned that thread, and it was because i lost the argument badly. in my defence, i've never flown any minmatar ship for anything, and i'd never even thought about how to fit any minmatar battleship except a mission mael before that. also, i didn't realize just how severe the penalties on hail were - i was used to void as a t2 damage ammo, which is tolerable if you assume the target is webbed. those were workups in 10 minutes in eft, made using the assumption of small-gang pvp fits with no rigs(which explains a few of the really odd things i did, and also the intentional lack of tackle gear). they turned out badly, and i defended them longer than i should have, but i don't think they're quite as horrible as you imply."
"i'd ask oz a million questions, but why bother?oz for god."
"umm, thanks i guess joss..and hi odet"
"and what about my ingame security? why would i actually want people to know my alts or mains as it were?if there is a ingame way for directors to account search features, then i should have an ingame way to charge them a fee to do so.out of game tactics should never be valid, otherwise you open a can of worms such as, including the ip address of peoples hosting services and their physical ip/mac in their bios to launch dos attacks against your war targets. big blob? not anymore!through api keys you are giving consent by generating your key, and handing it over. freely allowing anyone to know your alts? sure, give me $10,000 and 100 bil isk."
"cross posted from my blog, various things i'd work on as a csm. blog post with the industry and/or lowsec side of things to follow tonight.in no particular order: general forum improvementsccp has been changing the forums around a little lately, trying to improve them. im reserving comment on whether these changes really improve things or not, but we need some other changes that i havent seen any indication ccp has planned. as in, the best way to do it would be throwing out the current forums and just replacing it with better forum software  though if that would be difficult due to linking forum accounts to eve and the rest of the site (im unsure of the technical side of this), just a few simple improvements like increasing the post length limit (4000 characters? maybe i just like to talk, but personally i find this a bit low), adding a pm ability, and a better search function. and doing away with the profanity filter, which doesnt screen a lot of profanities, and screens a lot of things that arent profanities (granted, a number of them can be, but not in the context theyre most commonly used in  and certainly not when theyre simply part of a larger word). making it in game browser friendly would be really nifty, too. im sure there are other things, too, maybe you can suggest some! while were talking about increasing the character limit on forum posts, what about increasing the limit in eve-mails? i routinely find myself having to break up a mailing into two or more parts, which is extremely annoying, and creates unneeded clutter in mailboxes everywhere in eve. also in regards to eve mail, the ability to dump it to a text file on ones computer would be nifty, and make archiving things much easier. we have chat logs  why not mail logs?- not just more space for eve mails, but in bios, too. ability to kick players from a corp while they are in spaceoddly enough, you cant kick players from a corp while they are in space. which opens the door to all sorts of griefing, as players can enter a corp under false pretenses, open fire on corpmates without concord repercussions, and remain in space as members of the corp to shoot any other corp members who happen to undock. i doubt this happens every day, but its something that id like to see fixed, and that should be fairly easy to do if nothing else. some more icons for corps to choose from in their logos would be nice, especially some more obviously industrial, mining, research, and trade related ones. there are some, true, but . . . we could do with more. i cant imagine this would be terribly difficult to do, either. on that same topic, given the [url="
"moving on to the topic of roleplay and immersion: it has been rightly said that most of the content in eve is player created. the entire 0.0 endgame, for example (as an aside  i personally believe the endgame is what each player makes of it, and that 0.0 does not, and should not, hold exclusive claim to be eves endgame). when it comes to immersion and eves storyline, things are no different  most of the content and story is driven by the players. id like to see ccp get involved and acknowledge the player-driven storyline more. capsuleers are the most powerful beings in eve. the things we do should have an effect on eve, and id like to see more acknowledgment of that from ccp, see player driven storyline impact the official storyline more, and see ccp controlled npcs interact with players much more. opening things up again for players to submit stories to be made official chronicles would also be great. at the same time, theres nothing wrong with ccp created content. lets have more of it. maybe some more frequent chrons, perhaps ones in a different style than abraxas  i dearly love his work, but dont want to overwork him, and variety is good  as well as more events. especially events not related to factional warfare, some dealing with industry and trade would be nice. and some just pure freeform roleplay. of course, it could be that we have more than i think we do now, in which case whats needed is a bit more publicity. nothing wrong with combining player driven content and events, though. giving players tools to better create events would be pure win and awesome. back to official content here, i recall that at one point there was an effort to harmonize the prime fiction of eve, to find the various things that dont agree with each other and ninja-edit that all out. to the best of my knowledge, though, nothing ever came of this. im sure there would be players willing to volunteer to find most of the discrepancies, all ccp would have to do is decide what the official line for each of them is and make the edits.and that wraps this segment up, feel free to ask questions about any of these, i would be more than delighted to reply! more to come in my next blog post!"
"meissa's prettier.but then i'm prejudiced."
"i'm prettier than both of you and you can all stop derailing the thread now :p"
"keep it coming folks!o damn! first page3 csm !"

"* how did you feel the last csm went?* how do you think the process could be improved on?that's all i've got so far, gogogo csms"
"i think that the last csm session went better than i expected. i certainly think there were some character and process flaws that didn't need to be there which continue to this day, but i don't believe a lot of the drama and silliness from the first csm will carry over to the second as a new cast of people is elected. ultimately though in spite of it i think there was a great deal of success that unfortunately both we and ccp are still trying to determine how best to communicate.i think there's plenty of room for improvement in defining the council itself. i still don't think it's crystal clear where the council sits in the grand scheme of things, which is pretty unfortunate after 6 months. i also don't think that's something the council can define.i definitely think the meetings can use a lot of improvement. they start too early and end too late, though they're not as terribly managed as they were initially. i actually think that's contributed greatly to the problems we've been having with attendance.communication is also something that can be improved significantly. part of the purpose of the council is for people of different backgrounds to get together and have a dialogue and far too often it's simply not happening. this is really self defeating as people are only willing to raise items to be ignored so many times before throwing in the towel.i'd like to see more credit given to the csm when credit's due. this was mentioned before, even in the meetings, but i really don't see it happening. if you're going to make a dev blog about a new change, let's say to blockade runners, and the csm had an impact on that why not mention that? there's 1001 threads and a number of people who question the relevance of the csm and when there is a victory to point to i find it silly to not do so. why should the csm be in a position to have to toot their own horns? or volunteer their time to help shape these items and not be given any credit, only to have to run to the messageboards to defend their relevance on their own on a weekly basis with absolutely no support?i think these items are growing pains though, that actually sound a lot worse than they are. both ccp and the csm are young and i think that with the proper care it can grow into something really interesting. patience isn't a common virtue among gamers so it's trying at times, but i have a pretty positive outlook on the future."
"i know you've all been waiting, and after some trials and tribulations the second movie has just been released!so if you still need to decide where your vote goes, or if you were wondering what my plans for the future are, look no further.you can watch the new movie here.questions and feedback regarding the movie can be posted in this thread, and if you have questions regarding my campaign issues or the take care organisation, you can use my campaign thread."
"impressive. i think the music distracted a little bit from it, but otherwise i thought it was well done. even if i won't be voting for you, it was enjoyable to watch and a nice idea, one that i wish i could do. perhaps next time, though. . . ."
"shouldn't this really be added to your candidate thread instead?"
"not really, this is something different, there is no limit to threads posted here.as there is no discussion of issues/voting in this thread, it is on a different topic."
"really? so this isn't a plug for votes then, and the movie is about something totally unconnected?"
"posting in a thread that has an ingame video of me blowing things up \o/also: good video :)"
"when was this?"
"the little movie showing when i speak about factional warfare has siigari starring. :)"
"nice, improved from the first one good luck with the campaign"
"did i ask you to skip such important things? skipping meals is a total red herring, given how many times i've seen \"brb, lunch\" in the chatlogs, and the occasional important event is fully acceptable to miss a meeting for. jade's 12/0/0 is nice, but i don't expect it. what i do expect is that any member running will expect to manage inanna and lavista's 9/2/1 - miss the odd meeting, have to leave early or come in late sometimes, but usually be there. five delegates managed records on that level, and one quit for some reason that presumably meant that he wouldn't be able to continue doing his job. you, bane, and serenity have not done either. i don't claim that you're wasting a chair, or anything like that. you're a good person to have on the committee, and there's a couple issues where i'm pretty sure the rest of them would have done much better to have listened to you. when i say your attendance has been sub-par, that's all i'm saying. it's not at the level where you should express your regrets and resign, but it's at the level where you should probably look at your schedule and figure out if you can do better next time, or if you may want to sit out and wait to run for re-election until you can. your record may be exactly what you said it was, but i don't really think that's good enough. i give the same advice to every other candidate, as well - i'd be saying the same to bane and serenity if they were running, and while i expect less of alternates, i'll say that tusko and arithron should make sure that they can do better than their past records would indicate if they're elected(i exclude oz because i expect us to schedule around him if he gets elected, and he's made every meeting that hasn't been at 4 am local or hidden from him). the same for new candidates - if you can't do the job, withdraw from the race now and save us all the grief."
"as i said... i matched the records you just held up as exemplary. i missed 2 meetings. with notice. the last meeting i showed up for at the scheduled time, time which had been cleared in my week for that express purpose, and the meeting was moved to some internet format where no discussion was had, and questions went unanswered. sorry charlie but i think slamming me for actually showing up for scheduled meetings and being unable to attend a deviation is a bit of a farce.schedule meetings, hold to your schedule and i adjust my time as necessary when possible. deviate and assume everyone else's life is going to adjust to a last minute internet change and don't be surprised by the results.perhaps i'll give your criticism a bit more... validation when you actually have a record to be measured."
"the only attendance record i held up as exemplary was jade's, and you were nowhere near matching him. you weren't exemplary, you weren't in the \"adequate\" group with ank, dierdra, inanna, and lavista, you were down with bane and serenity in the c-minus group. still better than any alternate, and still not wretched, but weak. and while my rl record is just fine for providing validation to my argument, i know you can't access it, so i understand you not trusting my unverified claims on that score. electorate willing, you'll have good hard data on whether or not i'm a hypocrite come six months from now. until then, there's not really much more i can say."
"in order to have a two way dialogue you have to read what the other person says. my record for scheduled meetings was every bit as good as ank's, inanna, dierdra and lavista's.i don't really care about your record personally. i don't find it all that important. you seem to think it's a big deal which is something i find both hilarious and convenient. you've obviously taken a great deal of time to examine, editorialize and criticize my attendance record when you yourself have none. when you have one to compare, then we'll talk."
"you missed two scheduled meetings, ank and deirdra missed none. how exactly are those the same?"
"apologies, i had thought they had missed 2 as well. i wasn't exactly buried in the numbers."
"i frankly agree.however, to be fair, the term extended right trough the summer holiday period. in my own case, i went on holiday in seattle(9 hour flight) on a sunday and went back home on a sunday. just because you get a spot doesn't mean you should attend every meeting and give up other important things. eventually, real life is more important than eve. but i do agree you should do your damn best to make every meeting. but in some cases, it's just not possible."
"actually darius this is incorrect. you turned up one hour late (behind the published start-time) of the october 19th meeting and you apologized in channel for your lateness. six other csms and alternates had waited in the channel for the previous hour and we were unable to start because we couldn't make quorum of seven. by the time you arrived one of our alternates only had 30mins maximum before they absolutely had to head to bed and that is why we had to move to the suboptimal offline meeting format in the following week.if you are going to debate these things as part of your new election platform you need to be honest and state the facts as they happened. i don't consider you were \"present\" for the october 19th live meeting. csms and alternates in \"attendance\" for that were: ank, lavista, omber, jade, dierdra, tusko."
"actually, you have forgotten to note that some of the alternates aren't actually alternates! players like me replaced inactive alternates well into the csm period. it's hardly fair to start comparing records of attendance when there is no way we could have made earlier meetings.it should also be noted that alternates should be called into meetings when a known absence from a csm member is known in advance. i try and make as many meetings as i can, but don't always have voting rights (due to csm members making quorum).take care,arithron"
"arithron makes a very fair point. we did make a call to replace inactive alternates after the face to face iceland meeting (in time for meeting 9/10) and i personally invited people who had scored lower than the existing inactive alternates to step up and become alternates to try and resolve the problem. arithron is one of the guys who responded to the call and has made a good contribution to the csm since that decision."
"oh you're such a card. your interpretation of \"present\" doesn't really matter. the fact is that i was there. late or not. what you \"consider\" means nothing."
"thats what you said in this thread darius. it was incorrect. you either made a mistake or you were intentionally attempting to mislead the electorate here. now is the moment for you to apologize probably. you didn't show up at the scheduled time. you know it, i know it. and you even apologized for lateness on the day. this is quite a serious issue really - the eve player base needs to know that its csm delegates will take the obligations seriously and i have to say one of my major reservations about your candidacy is your ability to actually make time and commit to this process."
"v0v so i forgot i showed up a little late. sue me. the logs are there so purposely attempting to be misleading would be kind of silly now wouldn't it? i appreciate that you think this is some manner of oh-so-clever political manipulation but it's really quite petty and hilarious. no you didnt make it on time you showed up late!!! *crosses arms satisfactorily*you know as well as i do that your questioning my candidacy has absolutely nothing to do with your \"concerns\" over anything other than your dislike of me. i wonder why you could be bringing this issue up today... given that you're so concerned and all. you'd think this would have been an issue the entire time..."
"it wouldn't have been an issue if you'd just said \"sorry i was late\" (as you did on the day). but in this thread you have claimed on the record that you showed up at the scheduled time. that was incorrect and misleading since by your own admission you didn't. i think the eve voters deserve to know whether their candidates can be trusted to tell the truth or not. if you are prepared to tell a little fib to make your attendance record sound better what else might you be prepared to embroider or exaggerate about if something more serious was involved?now you can either apologize for misleading people or you can try and argue with me. your choice."
"i'll argue with you instead, as i've already responded to your clever attempt at a political \"monkey wrench\". the art of \"selective response\" has not been lost i see. fyi cherrypicking the parts of the post you like when you respond doesn't make the others go away."
"i used the word \"try\" advisedly. ultimately its pretty clear you lied in this thread in an effort to make your attendance and punctuality look better than it was. your response to being challenged on this is to attempt wriggling and evasion. perhaps thats considered an electoral asset amongst your supporters? who knows. but by all means have the last word on the issue, i've now set the record straight and continue as you wish."
"you were better off with the insinuation. directly calling me a liar is a bit silly when i've pointedly admitted that you may have been correct in my showing up a bit late to the meeting. that would be what i call \"being honest\". you see, i have no need to misrepresent my attendance record. i honestly don't see anything wrong with it. attempting to paint it as \"wriggling and evasion\" when the evidence in the thread points to the contrary is just as silly. i made an honest mistake and admitted as much. i will note though that we are glossing over the fact that being one of two representatives in the usa there is a 5 hour time difference and i can assure you, there's a world of difference between getting up a 10am every sunday, or every other as the case eventually became, for a meeting about spaceships, and strolling over to your computer at 3pm. i have to set my alarm clock in order to make it. it's not a complaint, but if we're going to be tossing rocks around we may as well have all the facts on the table.i'm not the one who came to the thread with a bone to pick and i think you'll find that ignoring what i've said in this very thread won't work out any better than your previous attempts at misdirection, giving orders or hilarious threats. by all means though continue selectively \"setting the record straight\". oh, and thanks for the advice chum i'll file it away with the rest.:edit: while we're \"setting the record straight\" it would also be worthwhile to note that none of this was mentioned previously. ever. funny how election season brings out people's sense of concern and responsibility."
"jade and arithron why do you think this is a bad idea?"
"i considered parallel development of skill time acceleration for players on the test server to be a low priority compared to development effort we've advised ccp to spend elsewhere."
"hence why i provided those neat little summaries at the end. if you weren't basing your numbers on those, what were you basing them on? when you look back at how i counted you, you'll note that gritt and azzazell(the two slackers) were counted for the first six meetings, at which point they were replaced by ben and you. i've counted each of you for six meetings, and i haven't penalized you for not being an alternate prior to that, or them for not being an alternate after that. of the six meetings that have happened since then, you've made two. i don't know if you have an explanation, but those are the numbers. i doubt either of you care, but in case anyone does i'll explain the definitions used in my stats. \"attending\" means voting in all votes that happened at the meeting, at least so far as my ability to ctrl-f can determine(i checked attendance at beginning and end, i wasn't willing to read 10 chatlogs to determine if anyone left for half an hour in the middle). \"partially attending\" means voting in at least one vote at that meeting but not all. for alternates who aren't replacing an absent member, i use presence in the channel as the test instead of votes. speaking specifically of darius in the aborted meeting #11, i gave him a \"partially attending\", since he got there late, and that's what he would have rated had the meeting actually run."
"the purpose of the test server is to test changes; part of the reason you might head there is to see how changes affect your character etc. since skills on tranq not going to be same as character on test server, it'll mean that issues affecting your character if changes made to tranq may be missed. i also think that its hard to find bugs and issues with things that are new to you (which will be the case once you train to use ships etc you are unfamiliar with).also, i don't think that the test server is as important as the server we play eve from! there are more important things for ccp to be considering...take care,arithron"
"alot of the questions aren't all that good, but i don't think we can fix that.however, the way the issues were posted maybe wasn't the best way. people need to be able to discuss each issue in it's own thread. the way this was posted, compared to the way wrangler did it, is a bit poor."
"a point, but i think it would have been fine if he'd linked back to the original issue threads. actually, that's probably the best way to do it, come to think of it - means people won't keep adding to them forever."
"have there been any updates on this issue? i dont read through the forums a lot due to my rl job."
"if ccp is thinking of revamping the whole messy pos mechanic, an elegant and common sense solution like this should be at the top of their list for consideration."
"bump for gallente e-war love."
"supported.there is very little point using rsd these days.if you need ew in a small gang the call for the falcon goes out."
"could they possibly be anymore vague. as what i have come to expect from ccp, their favorite tactic \"the five d's of content balance\". dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge!"
"is it possible that i could be in agreement with a gallente???please, don't tell anyone."
"yes."
"wow! this sounds cool!!!!much better than agent missions. they get stale quickly. this is what i thought all those innocuous \"news stories\" were all about on the right side of the character selection page, but i was sadly mistaken.too bad, some of these events sound like theyd be super fun if we could participate....."
"definately. the events of old are missed greatly by the older community. getting them back would be a major step forward. not to mention the droves of new players that organized events would bring in.lets face it, with events back in place, actual events, people would post on forums, blogs, youtube, etc. people would talk to their friends and co-workers about how they were involved in the massive slaughtering of empires, the protection of a renouned president from viscious marauders. people would come out of the woodwork to try it out, to see what all the commotion is, to see what it like to be a part of the game and not just a player. subscriptions would increase, ccp would get more money to fund ongoing projects, and the community would be happier in general. i understand the risk, but isnt the reward worth it?events are the life-blood of any rpg game. nobody bothers to read the news posts anymore. it's just wasted text on the log-in screen. why? because it no longer affects us, the players. we have our systems, our boats, our guns, and our wits. we're thrown into the game with no sense of direction or cause. tell me, did the empress coronation ceremony affect any of those? i didnt see a cluster of new systems open. i didnt get a shiny new ship. i got nothing. it was boring, and nobody gave a crap about it after it happened. hell, most people don't even know it happened. again, because it doesnt affect us, at all.i miss the days when trying to attack a leader was possible. when it wasnt all figureheads and text. i want to see sarum floating around space with the amarr navy surrounding her. i want to see heth coming and going from press conferences. i'm tired of having a story fed to me, whether i like it or not. i'm tired of being powerless to change my surroundings. i'm tired of watching everything collapse because i am a player, and thus have no voice.we are the players. we will be heard."
"i totally agree with bringing back interactive events.i really envy those of you who were around when players were able to actually participate in the events that had a real bearing on the eve storyline. it would be tremendous if those of us not fortunate enough to have 4 or 5 year old characters, especially roleplayers, could have that opportunity again."
"support or ill bump all over you :)"
"i disagree with this. though it sucks to lose the \"ghost training\", it never made sense to me in the first place. i couldnt understand why one could get a benefit from this game and yet not pay. that is just bad business.u pay = u play.if you are paying you can get the advantages of playing - ie: trianing.now, however, when are you guys gonna implement a skill queue so that we can get 100% benefit from paying? this, my friends is the real insult! why cant i train things at the pace i want in the order i want without having to center my life around my home computer even though im paying for this game?!?!?!?!?!remove ghost training? i understand the business sense of this decision. continue to refuse to give us a skill queue even though we are paying for this game and many people support it? i dont understand the business sense of this decision. you guys are as random as the wind."
"why not just decrease the training speed by 50%? i think this would be the best option because i both agree and disagree with it being in the game and being taken out.its always nice to come back to eve and being able to use a shiny new toy (i've been playing on and off for about 5 years now) but i think its being abused by people who have a skill that takes over 30 days to train pay for a month and cancel the account effectively gaining free training time while dualing to another account. this would take that skill over 60 days to train, but it would still train basically stopping the effectiveness of this.that being said.for people that genuinly cancel their account because they legitimately wanna take a break or just have been bored, can still have the option of setting a long skill to train and coming back later whenever they feel like coming back, as usually (especially for me) most people that genuinly want a break take a break for 3-4 months anyways. that stops the abuse of someone that has two accounts and sets one skill to train and cancels it earning them 7 free days, while they play another toon, and still rewards people and makes them want to return after those breaks.sorry if this doesn't make too much sense. my brain is fried as i've been at work since 5 am"
"this topic goes up !"
"give me a fuel bay and the ability to use a cov-ops cloak and i will be happy with my sin. give me some more powergrid along with it and i will be ecstatic.haulers that can be jump bridged are not the solution, although apparently that is what we are getting, i suppose i can sell it to someone with a trader alt who needs to move stuff to and from low sec safely.like we dont already have enough haulers in this game."
"it's bad enough as it is, don't make it worse."
"sorry, but the dt is a nice reminder for me to go to bed. so while a 22:00 dt won't stop me playing, it will mean i risk staying up all night."
"i strongly disagree. i think unnamed t1 loot should be removed from all npc spawns, but removing minerals from loot? that would flood the market with t1 goods. this idea is outlined on my webpage.level 4 missions are perhaps the only source of morphite in empire (excluding the market), so having something that gives the high-security players a taste of low-sec without seriously hindering the mercoxit mining trade is a good thing.the drone alloys replace bounties, and allow the player to use said items to create ships and weapons and such (yes, even morphite for t2 items). balancing the amount of compounds that the drones give out seems like the best answer to this problem, if indeed it is a problem."
"nooooooo. it's hard enough getting good returns on drone region rats when you have to wait days for minerals to sell without them nerfing profits even more. nerf l4 missions - they are the ones which contribute most of the morphite in highsec."
"nerf drone minerals please... i am a miner and drone farmers drive me out of business... mmm let drones give something else of value"
"like the title says, i would love for that to be possible.you know... build an outpost, donate it to the guristas, bam, guristas sov system, guristas npcs in belts alongside the regular local npcs, etc and if you could get something back from that (standings and/or lps for all/some corp members), now that would be peachy too... but if not, eh, ok too."
"this seems more likely to be used for truly epic griefing than for the kind of role-play you're presumably thinking of. who would spend several billion isk to give away sovereignty of a system?"
"yes."
"yes."
"i support this as long as we see people without pants"
"there's always controversy around how they run it, but as every year they try to address the concerns of the previous year. keep it up!vote yes. :)"
"big red yes, tournament was always a highlight in this great game."
"great idea for additional info!"
"this thread. i support."
"i love it the way it is right now! (on tranq not sisi)"
"i'd hate for it to get all sniping cowards."
"basically heres the plan : the starter corporations keep members for 30days. this protects new players from excessive war dec griefing, as i believe is ccps intentions. however, on the 31st day, much like the agents already do, they are handed off to the next higher level of the organization, and to a more stable corporation. for example, moving from the republic military school to say the republic security services. with these new npcs corporations taking on hirings, change the rules, and incorporate faction warfare, so allow people in an amarr npc corporation, to declare war on a minmatar npc corporation. if players don't wish to par take in a pvp enviornment, they have two options. one is to state deep in minmatar (or home race) territory while the fringes are fought out. the second is to join a player corporation that focuses on non-pvp type activities. this will help flush out the macrominers, as no one *wants* them in their corporation because they're not a productive member to the corporation. it will also allow the hostile npc corporation to thin the herd of macroming. optionally, you could also setup a war dec option for player corporations against the npc corporation, but should restrict it to single corporations, and not allow alliances to wardec. again, this would have to be looked at further, and could cause a slew of griefing complaints, but would help to push people out of the safety of the npc corporations and into actual productive members of 'real' corporations. just an idea i was kicking around, what do you all think?"
"no, all ideas that punish the large swathes of legitimate npc corp players to get to a few that abuse it cannot be allowed."
"exactly. and this wouldn't even do much to flush out macroers because they can just form their own corp. if they get wardeced, they all just jump to another corp before the war goes live.or each macro miner just trains corp management 1 so it can sit in a 1 man corp. thus still being safe from war decs."
"i got this recently from someone in my corp after they received the usual you sol on their petition... not being that familiar with pos behavior i figured i would post it here and see if this made sense to anyone - and if so could you explain it to me?------------------------------what i'm saying is, is that the pos should not have flagged and shot me before i enabled the agresssion setting, but it did. thus i earned a flag that should not have been there because of my act of aggression. if this is normal, then it is an apparent bug that must be addressed. i still stand by my assertion that an aggro flag that shouldn't have been initiated was initiated, thus resulting in the loss.your log should show myself dropping a can, taking control of a laser battery, firing on the can and then releasing control. then i receive fire from said battery, and duck into the forcefield therefore saving my ship. then, i set the aggression option. after that, i leave the forcefield and receive fire again......but die that time. like i said......bug???------------------------------thanks in advance!"
"i'd be inclined to think there's \"human error\" factor here.but still... if its a valid bug.... this needs looking into."
"yes please"
"give me the op plus both of these. the op suggestion is really minor, but it's a nice thing to have."
"supported - particularly that of aligning to bookmarks. these things don't have to be as difficult as they currently are ingame.however, i would also like to evaluate whether this can give an unfair advantage to those avoiding pursuit."
"this!!"
"/me thumbs up"
"here's the submission template."
"if you think it's boring autopiloting from 15 km, why are you even autopiloting then? if you're at the keyboard, just manually enter in each warp to point, and you'll be fine.this game is not built to be an instant gratification system. you can't mount your dragon and head directly to whatever point you want, you have to go through each system manually. if you don't like this, there are many other games which give instant gratification.warp to zero was an idea that received a lot of flack back when it was released, but it's a good system. for all i'm concerned, they can even get rid of the whole autopilot option (although it does have it's uses, so i'm not recommending this step in any way).if you think this game isn't automated enough, there are other games out there (ie jumpgate) where you can't even warp to the next gate - you have to manually accelerate once you're pointed in the right direction then decelerate once you arrive there. this is eve, and you have to use what you have to reach your goals.i will admit that the suicide gank in high-security space is broken, but that's why it's being looked at by ccp. changing the piloting system is not the answer to preventing suicide ganks.i'm sorry for the rant, but i've heard a lot about this idea, and each time it's by the vocal minority. don't change the game i love to make it easier."
"because the very existence of the autopilot is a concession to the fact that it's a very big game universe that most ships move through very slowly. my principle is that the game shouldn't play for you at all. i'm willing to make an exception for the autopilot, for the aforementioned reason, but i want the game to be significantly worse at playing itself than you are. if you can't be bothered reading a thread that you come in to try to argue in, then i can't be bothered heading over to your place to accommodate you."
"dont be ridiculous. autopilot is for afk, and if you're afk you wont be bored. if you're at keyboard you can warp to 0 manually, thus no problem. what are you complaining about?"
"if a window was ever made, redock timer has to be 3 minutes."
"in empire wars it's quite easy to spot a target and refit accordingly though i would not use it to strengthen the argument. hence why i fitted out a ship with two specific and the rest general miscellaneous. remote eccm doesn't really work very well when your solo and this is the problem for me falcons et al are making solo pvp boring. falcons actually stop people from engaging and combat never happens and thus causing the game to get stale as much as speed."
"2 ships > 1 ship so nerf falcons...?the kind of people that falcons \"stop from engaging\" are the kind that would never give you the fights you're looking for anyway. there's no possible way that you can balance 2 ships vs 1 ship without utterly breaking at least 1 of them."
"firstly i don't know how you can compare ecm to tds, ecm jams 2-4 ships out of a fight at 200km, tds are lucky to take one, then rsds are worthless unless used in conjunction with ecm.secondly i see a lot of the time small gangs disengaging or not fighting because one side has a falcon or more, pilots end up docking or warping off. if i got attacked by a gang with a falcon most times i will disengage or try escape, where if the falcon wasn't there perhaps i would stand my ground and fight. actually a lot of the times falcons have actually saved me because i had nothing to do but try and escape, thing is this thread isn't about falcon being overpowered it's about eccm being underpowered."
"there's no reason to support this. ccp is already working on doing something with eccm."
"i was trying to say that even a psychic with way too much money can't get as obscene as you might think. i don't think i expressed that sentiment particularly well, though ."
"give eccm and additional effect to make it usefull outside of just countering ecm."
"yeh i know i'm just gloating."
"after being pointed in the correct direction, i'm posting a suggestion about an amendment to the reimbursement policy to cover for problems that are down to proven ccp server issues. i've only noticed that this policy is unfair, in my opinion, after losing expensive fittings that i'd saved up for earning isk the correct way, through hard work and hard hours.on the day of server issues, i logged on and started to do a mission. my ship warped there fine, but when i came to turn the modules on, nothing happened and i noticed my shields starting to drop. i then tried to align and warp, but nothing happened and the next thing, i'm in a pod. it appeared that i was also warp jammed. i started a petition.on checking the forums, about the same time as my ship loss, a thread had been created about the server issues. attempting to log back in i saw warning messages about server issues which were not there before.my wreck was left alone as knowing this was a ccp error, and nothing to do with me at all, i assumed i would get the ship back as it was. and this was my first reimbursement petition. reading the ccp policy, it reads as though if the pilot is at fault, which i certainly wasn't. looting the wreck would have been hard due to the server issues, and i wasn't sure if that was the right thing to do as i had petitioned it and it wouldn't be fair to have the items twice or have the petition refused for doing so. i also shouldn't have to risk another ship to attempt to get the items back, no matter what the cost.now i'm thankful i got the ship back. but i should have the items that were \"dropped\" when the ship was destroyed as this was 100% a ccp server error. other people should be reimbursed for anything they loose due to a ccp error.just a suggestion."
"this came up in another thread, and the more i thought about it - the more i liked the idea - here it is ...add an option to the ship fittings (similar to auto-reload) to automatically turn on specific fittings upon exit from warp. this could be used upon exit from warp to turn things on - for example afterburners, boosters and hardeners. if you are cloaked, these settings would have no effect.thoughts?"
"i was gonna say.... insta cloak at gate camps would be nasty at best.but since you said \"if your cloaked...\" as a qualifier... this has my attention.i'd like to see more comments first."
"i can only assume you train <6 skills, because otherwise this doesn't matter. this whole time i was training energy management 5, and lost exactly 0 hours of game time. while what you ask for wouldn't be unreasonable if you were say- paying for time in a strip club- this is eve, and we already deal with a dayly server outtage called down time. set a long skill when you can log in, and quit crying. the 50 sp you lost in the time you were gone won't make that much of a difference in how long you get into bob.go back to your whining cave."
"\"diapers\", \"cry\", \"whine\", \"emoragequit\", etc.what passes for chivalry on the internet is.... interesting. in the eve forums, it comes out as a delectable mix of pompousness and aggressiveness, and its actually a mark of immaturity from the people that can't rationally weigh the merits of various options and consider what might make views that they oppose plausible.having your skill train is a passive form of participation in the game: it is what gives you character continuity. however, it is active play, i.e. logging in and flying about that makes the game an activity. when i buy 60 days of game time, i should get 60 actual days of active game time (not counting the scheduled outages, as mentioned in my first post). if there are outages and issues, that is fine since it is to some extent inevitable, however the time lost should be on ccp's coin, and not the consumer's.if you really, in the depths of your heart where you are honest with yourself and not just defensively lashing out on people on an internet forum, believe that skill training is adequate gameplay and equal to it, then no increment of substituting logged in active gameplay with passive skill training should bother you.in that case, i've got some 60 day \"never log in\" skill train cards to sell you, $34.99 a pop. i know you might be the kind of player that might use them up training some very large ship. but then what? is it really \"the same\"?"
"i don't really see where you were abused. you post your opinion about what might be a good change, to you, and most people think it is a ridiculous idea smacking of entitlement syndrome- some good natured ribbing follows...what's the problem? i think this is an unbelievably good game and has great support, better than anything i've seen. we play in this hugely complex virtual world for about 5 cents an hour. but you want to be reimbursed for every minute that you don't get to play because of some unforseen system problem. i think that is totally unresonable. you claim that you are a \"savvy\" consumer. well, when you installed ccp's software on your computer you clicked the \"accept\" button during the software install as a condition of having the privlege to use ccp's software. before clicking that \"accept\" button, you were given the opportunity to read the eula and click the \"decline\" button if you did not agree to ccp's methods. here, \"savvy\" consumer, is what you agreed to: (cut and pasted from the eula)no warrantiesthe software, system, game and all game content, and all other services and material provided in connection therewith, are provided \"as is,\" with all faults, and without warranty of any kind. you assume all risk of use and all risk associated with accessing the system and playing the game. ccp disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for particular purpose and non-infringement. there is no warranty against interference with your enjoyment of the game. ccp does not warrant that the operation of the system or your access to the system, or that your use of the software, will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor that the system or software will be compatible with your hardware and software. while ccp attempts to have the system available at most times, ccp does not guarantee that the system will always be available, or that the system will not become unavailable during game play. the system may become unavailable for a number of reasons, including without limitation during the performance of maintenance to the system, for the implementation of new software, for emergency situations and due to equipment or telecommunications failures.obviously, you have changed your mind about the eula and it is entirely within your right as a \"savvy\" consumer to cancel your subscription. without being reimbursed for time not used, of course."
"what ccp has the right to do on the one hand, and what they should do for the sake of fairness or customer service may be two different things. ccp may very well have strongarmed its customers into accepting all kinds of terms which its customers explicitly accept as terms of use: in fact it is somewhat typical for the more ruthless and unscrupulous businesses to write all kinds of things in the clauses of a contract for something people very much want. but my argument is not about what ccp is legally obligated to do: it is an argument about what they should do in order to be fair."
"whats fair?you would \"dare\" use such a word in the context of eve-online?pfft.... i learned the hard way... there's no such thing as fair.nothing in life is ever \"fair\"it's what you make of it.all your doing is throwing a fit over a few nickles to a measly 25 cents.honestly.... the only way your going to get compensated is if the outage is signiificant... not to mention repetitive.if your that sore about it... then leave.... or subscribe to the bloody game.either way.... your crying over spilt milk.i'm quite pleased i'm getting all of this and more for a measily 14 bucks a month.the only way i'm going to change my mind on the matter is if the outage is 1 to 3 days long.then i'm going to get upset.it's not the end of the world if i can't play eve at the end of the day... \"**** happens\" as they say.of course if it was every week.... again.. i'd be upset.this is a matter of rationality.... and reason... not your bloody pocket book."
"\"whats fair?you would \"dare\" use such a word in the context of eve-online?\"...yes, because there is a distinction between the content of the fictional universe that is the game, and the real-world business that provides the game. if i walk into a bookstore to buy the latest thug-crime novel, and when i proceed to pay at the front desk the clerk punches me in the nose and takes my wallet, that is unjust and unacceptable even if the characters in the novel that i purchase also act that way. if i say to the clerk \"that was criminal and uncalled for!,\" and the clerk responds \"you dare to talk about what's criminal when purchasing a book about thug life? i should blow your head off right now\", his response would be absurd. your appeal to some claim that a business can be unscrupulous, because the fictional universe that it sells is about lacking scruples, is absurd for the same reasons.and again, the reference to monetary compensation is out of place (this thread is already littered with that equivocation) because that is not what i argued for. i'm putting out the suggestion that ccp should add the game time that was lost by unscheduled outages, not that they should toss me some nickels and dimes. it is not uncommon for businesses to credit consumers for time when a service was not used due to some breakdown or issue on the side of the business, where the consumers had paid for a longer period of use of that service in advance.now what i find interesting in your response is that you seem to admit that there is a threshold at which you as a customer would think that ccp was giving you the short end of the stick. so, for you, a one day outage starts to be your boiling point. this is interesting because it seems to cross over from the \"ccp can/should do whatever it wants\" side, into the side that concedes that ccp can be out of line and unfair, even if it is within the terms of its eula. in other words, you agree with me and just differ over the threshold of when consumers should seek redress. i'm open to that kind of discussion.oh and the word is \"measly\" not \"measily\" - i'm not pointing that out to land sucker punches at you, i'm just pointing out the misspelling. and also, it's no longer 14 bucks a month. ccp upped the ante on what they charge us, remember? the various moves by ccp to shake more money out of the pockets of its customers are part of what makes fanboy consumers finally become a bit more critical, and motivates some of the closer attention to ccp's recent business practices."
"here's the submission template:"
"ccp really wants to stop us from ghost training. fine lets 'give them that'.in return, because we are as important as those keeping the servers online (or maybe even more), ccp should re-release 30d and 90d gtc's.wasn't one of the main and most important reasons for their removal, the abuse of ghost-training from the part of the players, through the use of certain gtc's?"
"so you want to penalise people more for disconnecting?no."
"neither did i, but hey."
"logoffski is against eve rules. no one here is talking about punishing logoffs, we're trying to find a solution to logoffski."
"[ x ] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic.not only change it, but, ensure that the mission runner cannot be aggroed in return by the \"salvager\" when he decides to return in a fully fitted pvp ship.mission runners risk losing their ship to a bad spawn aggro, the \"salvagers\" run no risk at all. most \"salvagers\" now opt to steal loot so as to return in fully fitted pvp ships to gain a navy bs kill on their killboards.mission runners own the wrecks in my opinion and should be allowed to defend their gains without the ability of the \"salvager\" to aggress within a timer.i use inverted comma's around the word salvager as more often than not, the whole reason for probing a mission is to gain aggro on the mission runner, thus making profit from the mission runner's faction mods.mwd's cannot be used in deadspace, so how hard would it be for ccp to alter the salvaging rules there too?hi sec is not a safe place for the most ardent of carebears as it is, and whilst i appreciate not everyone likes pve alone, those that do, should be made safer. if everyone could run a mission without the fear of ship or isk loss, surely this would help to reduce the macro users and isk buyers. pvp chars could then run legitimate alts purely for isk making via mission running.besides, if a salvager wishes to make money from his \"proffesion\", take it to lo sec roid belts and enter into a risky business and stop profiteering from players just wishing to mind their own business."
"no, never going to happen. and most mission runner killers i know don't really care about the navy bs kill. what they want are the faction fittings.dang, then those mission runners who loose their ship in a mission must suck at running missions. i've been running missions for two years and have never lost a ship in one.the salvage belongs to the first one that gets to it. that's what ccp always says anyway."
"the only time a mission runner faces any risk is when they screw up."
"very true sir, but there is still an element of risk, albeit if it is from their own stupidity. there should, imho be a risk to the thief / salvager."
"the salvagers risk being shot by the ppl they steal loot from. if they arent interested in the loot and they are just salvaging... they arent hurting you. as wrecks are out there for anyone to salvage.but honestly i dont care if it gives aggro. mission runners should either (a) pvp the salvager and be willing to face the consequences for firing on him (win or loose) or (b) ignore, there is nothing that salvaging does that directly prevents you from finishing the mission. where as stealing the loot can, hence loot theft should give aggro while salvaging shouldnt. but again like i said... cba to care"
"after a bit of thought, my opinion is:[x] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic.i feel it's a risk vs. reward thing. if you find abandoned wrecks, hey, loot and salvage them if you want. just be aware that there is a small risk that the person they belonged to might see you in the next fifteen minutes and care enough to shoot you (personally, i probably wouldn't care enough to shoot someone who had looted/salvaged from wrecks i had abandoned). if you can manage to salvage and/or loot a mission someone's still doing, more power to you, but where there is reward, there should be risk -- and the risk here is not great, since a mission fit ship probably will not have a warp disrupter.one thing i might think about changing, however, is allowing wrecks to be tractorable by anyone. to prevent abuse, however, this should result in an agression flag. transferable salvage rights would also be cool."

"what is your opinion on pirate gatecamps? i am not saying it should be impossible. but you say life is becoming harder for pirates due to some random stuff, while gatecamping is only becoming easier for the pirates (more people = larger gangs = easier to tank guns, introduction of hics, etc). and while pirates seem to enjoy whining about being blobbed 25 vs 5, they dont have any issues ganking a noob 5 vs 1. somewhere in gd it was asked how you can get more people into low sec. the answer many gave and what i also think: decrease the number of gatecamps. sure i know low sec isnt camped everywhere (am often enough in low sec), but if you run into a gatecamp you lose a ship without anything you can do about it. i would have no issues with making it easier for pirates to find people in belts when low sec rats get improved, but then it should be compensated by a nerf to their ability to gatecamp."
